3876961,5,B0029KN8BC,"These WhistleFritz DVDs are great for immersing children in the Spanish language.  My kids love the songs and my 5 year old (after watching these DVDs) is continually asking me ""How do I say this in Spanish?."" Wonderful product!!  Kind of like a Spanish version of Blues Clues with a beautiful hispanic host!!",1276646400,,309,4.811320754716981
3876962,5,B0029KN8BC,Great DVD for kids.  I have many Spanish DVDs for kids and this undoubtedly one of the best.  Content captivating for young kids and my nearly 3 year old especially likes the action songs.  Authentic music content with acoustic guitar by Jos and the host Maria is captivating.  A good progression from the Vibora de la Mar DVDs.  Audio and video superior quality and first of the three DVDs in the series to be produced in wide screen format.  Highly recommended.,1273708800,,463,4.654320987654321
3876963,5,B0029KN8BC,"I bought this DVD to complete my Whistle Fritz set. We now have all three DVDs. My twin daughters are almost one. My husband is Spanish and we live in the UK. (these seem to work on European DVD players fine) The presenter Maria is a bundle of fun. My daughter Lily laughes and claps as soon as she appears on the screen. She speaks VERY clearly and even to a non Spanish speaker like myself it's quite obvious what she is talking about as she repeats the same words throughout the DVD. My husband is very critical of most of the resources I buy as the Spanish spoken is South American rather than European Spanish. With this DVD however he seems delighted with the content. It's a very professional, well presented and fun DVD which I would highly recommend!!!",1269475200,,761,4.442857142857143
3876964,5,B0029KN8BC,Spanish is sooo much easier to learn for children when there's entertainment included. The language and intonations will expose the children to another voice than the teacher's or the Spanish news channel. All for stimulation and education.,1260316800,,240,5.513513513513513
3876965,5,B0029KN8BC,"As a former Spanish teacher with experience in grade K-12, I am super excited about this DVD set from Whistlefritz! It is both educational and enjoyable to watch! I have searched high and low for something my 2 year old can view that can grow with her, use common language, engage, and allow some play with the other ""ninos"" (kids) on the screen. We have the entire set of DVDS. She knows all of the songs, vocabulary and loves to dance to the music. Thanks for creating a playful, easy going and informative educational experience!",1258588800,,532,4.610526315789474
3876966,5,B0029KN8BC,We own the two previous Whistlefritz DVDs plus the music CD and my 2 1/2 yr old daughter loves them all. I had no doubt she would like the latest production so I bought it as a surprise for her to watch during a recent 6 hr car trip. She LOVED Fritzi! She watched the DVD over and over and over during our vacation and beyond. My first language is Spanish and I have been teaching my daughter since the day she was born. Now that she's a little older and knows more Spanish she can interact more with Maria by answering and repeating her words. I was glad to see Jorge Anaya perform in the DVD. My daughter likes all of his songs. I wish they would have put more new songs in this production (next time please!) but including some of the old ones gave it some continuity.  Dora doesn't teach any Spanish to your kids unless you play the Spanish track (which we always do). I highly recommend purchasing all of the Whistlefritz productions.  They are well made and well thought out.  The Whistlefritz DVDs have helped me teach my daughter Spanish.  Get it! &iexcl;Compralo!,1253491200,6,1072,4.398989898989899
3876967,5,B0029KN8BC,"Educational research continues to point out that the best method for learning a second language is in early childhood, through immersion - the same way children learn their mother tongue. Living North America puts parents who seek to give their children a bilingual advantage in a difficult position. The vast majority of us are monolingual, speaking only English, the international language of trade and commerce.

So, what's a mom to do who wants to equip her young children with a solid foundation in a second language when she only speaks one? The lack of high quality resource for Spanish immersion was just the catalyst needed for one mom to launch Whistlefritz and the Spanish for Beginners series in 2006.

The latest release in the series - Adentro y Afuera (Inside and Out) is designed to appeal to children from ages two through seven - and does it ever. Who would have thought that a 30-minute DVD, entirely in Spanish, would so captivate the hearts and attention of my one, three, and six-year-old?

I was a bit skeptical as I popped in the disc. My children are largely unfamiliar with Spanish. They've seen Dora, watched some educational DVDs that teach common phrases through English to Spanish translation and repetition, but have no formal language education under their belts. I was so surprised to find my children singing, dancing, and laughing throughout an entirely Spanish presentation of what could pass for cable television children's programming.

The animated host ""Maria"" leads children through scenarios revolving around a small, animated mouse named Fritzi who whistles to communicate (hence the company name, Whistlefritz.) Similar in style to the popular television series Blues Clues, Maria and her gang of multi-cultural children in the target age ranges interact against a colourful, cartoon backdrop with the animated mouse, and a variety of entertaining hand puppets. Live action segments are also interspersed throughout the DVD, showing the children interacting and singing in real settings.

Maria communicates the meaning of the Spanish words she uses through repetition, exaggerated facial expressions, props, hand gestures, and body movements. Her level of enthusiasm is contagious, and she is an excellent teacher. Narrative teaching is broken up with songs from Horge Anya which include activity songs where children are prompted to perform certain hand movements in response to the lyrics, songs about food, songs about the directions (up and down) and so on.

The narrative teaching focuses on greetings, room names, common locations (in front of, on the side of, on top of, etc.), food names, numbers up to ten, bathroom tasks, and more. A vocabulary guide which includes the Spanish words in the order they are presented on the disc, and their English translations is provided to help children decipher the meaning of words which are more difficult to determine from context. Parents who watch the DVD with their children and discuss the onscreen action and vocabulary with them will greatly enhance the effectiveness of the DVD, and pick up valuable Spanish skills themselves.

With Maria and Horge both speaking Spanish fluently, their accents are bang on to my untrained ear. They speak at a slower pace than a native speaker would in order to allow children to follow them, and often repeat words and phrases to encourage children to join in with responses. My two oldest girls were already chattering away from time to time with the disc on it's second play through.

The DVD menu provides options to play the disc through, put the disc on auto play, or play only the song segments. No scene selection option is provided, though with a 30-minute disc that isn't a hardship.

I've been teaching my six-year-old the five-star rating system; when I asked her how she'd rateSpanish for Beginners: Adentro y Afuera (Inside and Out) she replied, ""Six stars, I'd give it eight if I could."" The natural humour, infectious joy, and enthusiasm contained on the DVD have already made it a much-requested favourite in our home. My six-year-old has asked for it four times today (I had to stop her or she would have kept going.) It's just this sort of repetition in an immersive language experience that will help build a solid foundation for future studies in Spanish.

Whether you want to give your children a taste of Spanish for National Hispanic Heritage Month (Sept. 15-Oct 15, 2009), supplement a more traditional language program, or use the Spanish for Beginners series as the first step in a full-immersion course of study, Adentro y Afuera (Inside and Out) is well worth your investment in time and money.

3876968,5,B0029KN8BC,"First of all, where is that park!  It is incredible!  I'd also like to know who provided the food for the picnic.  It looks delicious!  I am especially pleased with these picnic scenes because they have inspired my finicky, very verbal two-year old to eat.  Ever since she saw the film for the first time she has been asking me for foods she saw the children eating in the video.  She has said, ""Mommy, I want some corn to bite!"" and ""Can I have green beans?"" and ""Can I eat some chicken?"" and ""I want some plums.""  This morning she was eating grapes and told me, ""I'm eating, just like in the movie!""

This DVD is now the only video my daughter wants to watch.  First of all, she loves watching the kids sing and play, inside and at the park.  We both enjoyed the introduction of the Jorge character, the musician responsible for the Whistlefritz music.  We have enjoyed his music in the other two DVDs as well as the CD (which I highly recommend if you haven't heard it yet) so it was fun to see him.  My daughter was also very excited to see Fritzi the mouse.  She talks about him constantly now.  There is a grey cartoon mouse on her placemat so every morning at breakfast she looks at him and says, ""Hola, Fritzi!""  She especially likes the part at the end when Fritzi is in bed pretending to sleep.  He opens his eyes, smiles at the camera, and then winks.  That gets a laugh every time!  I have to rewind to that scene several times before we can turn off the TV.

Finally, I like the ""Songs"" feature on this DVD.  If we don't have enough time for her to watch the whole video, or I just need a distraction for a diaper change, I can turn on the songs for her to listen to and watch.  As with all of the other Whistlefritz songs, they are enjoyable even for adults.

I am a fan of all of the Whistlefritz products.  We have the first two DVDs and the CD and love them all.",1244332800,5,1879,4.172701949860724

The language is slow enough for kids and adults to clearly hear what is being said even if you don't understand it. The important words are repeated often. There is enough singing and bright colors to also hold a child's attention.

Again, my daughter won't be learning Spanish from just these videos but she has started counting in Spanish and identifying some objects using Spanish vocabulary as well as English. I hope the repeated exposure from the videos help with my kid's Spanish accent and help her more comfortable with learning the language when we put her in a Spanish program in the near furture.",1439683200,2,827,4.696551724137931

It's filled with very catchy songs incorporating the words and themes previously mentioned(fruit, up&down,  food, hide&seek, and directions)in each sement of the video. It's a total immersion video, meaning the characters speak only Spanish the entire time and you can tell they are native speakers. The video has tons of visual cues so even if you don't understand a single spanish word, its easy enough to follow along. It says its for 2-7 years but it completely captivates my 11 month olds from start to finish.",1374883200,,541,4.945054945054945
3877006,5,B0029KN8BC,"I'm 28 years old and grew up in Texas so I was raised with some exposure to Spanish, but nothing near conversational. My biggest struggle was being able to follow the fast pace of Spanish speakers, so I thought a children's show would be good. After reading many reviews, I bought this as well as the El Gato y El Perro videos.

Though this is more expensive, I feel I've learned a lot more and quicker with this video. There is no English in this at all. I was so exhausted trying to follow this the first time, and it even ended up in my dreams that night. But the next day while driving for errands, I found myself singing the fruit song with the different fruit (Si si si... mi gusta comer platanas, uvas, mancanas, etc) so obviously something started sticking.

Instead of learning word association, you learn via direct association (you don't learn apple = manzana, you learn to associate the image with manzana). I already know MANY Spanish WORDS, but I don't know how to build sentences! That's where this video truly trumps the other videos I've bought. The host speaks at a normal pace for children, so it has helped me become more accustomed to hearing it and being able to follow along. It also forces me to figure things out. I wish I had a better way of explaining it, but the best way I can come up with is that it's a bunch of confusion that your brain naturally sorts out. Admittedly, I have pulled out my Spanish-English dictionary, too, when all else fails and I just can't figure it out.

In short, as an adult I have found this very useful and plan on buying the others from this maker. It is cheaper and less time consuming than taking a Spanish course at the local community college, and it helps give me a stronger foundation for being able to take on more advanced tasks like watching Spanish films (without subtitles) and reading Spanish books. And truth be told, I have learned more with this video than I did in my introductory Spanish course in college (how sad...)",1373760000,45,1994,4.472527472527473

These videos have sparked a renewed interest in Spanish as they are easy to understand and really geared toward the pre-school age group.  I like how they use ONLY Spanish in age-appropriate ways (through pictures, kids, games and animals) and repeat key phrases over and over.  Even my 1 1/2 year old nephew was captured--especially by Los Animales.  He can barely talk, has only been exposed to English but seemed to completely understand the content despite it being entirely in Spanish!",1372377600,,651,4.935779816513762

3877010,4,B0029KN8BC,"This is a great video.  I purchased for my 5 and 8 year old.  I purposely showed the 5 year old the video and asked her if she wanted to watch it before I even showed the 8 yr old, as I wanted to see her own reaction to it. I am ""not quite fluent"" in Spanish and have been ""somewhat"" working on teaching both girls Spanish myself for a while now.  Both my girls have learned their colors, numbers through 100 (although they usually always only remember up though 39), some greetings, months, days of the week, and a few odd things like that.  We just add things as we get a chance and I have not ""formally"" sat down and attempted to teach them much more.  My five year old is eating it up, my 8 year old has always been a bit more resistant about it. They are also currently enrolled in a (very laid back) children's community Spanish class... so they have a small (very small) working knowledge of Spanish.  I saw this and thought it looked like a nice approach and figured I'd give it a try.

My five year old liked it very much! She did not get up and dance and sing like I had hoped, but she really liked the little mouse and said she liked the video. When I mentioned that there were other videos in the series and asked if she might be interested in them in the future, she got excited.  I do like that this is all in Spanish.  The hostess does speak very slowly (but not in an annoying way) and repeats things enough for the kids to understand.  There is opportunity for interaction, but my daughter did not really engage in that part (or at least not out loud).  I did sit and watch it with her and somewhat ""translate"" some parts of it... but she might have been fine without me doing so.  I simply said a few of the words in Spanish again and then in English right afterwards so she understood what was going on... or just to emphasize and have it sink in.  It definitely helped that I know Spanish when watching this, but it was not essential. A parent would be okay if they did not know any Spanish, but it does help if you know a tiny bit.  More for those questions afterwards to continue the learning like... ""so what was carrots in Spanish?""

We have the Muzzy program as well but never used it to its full capabilities (someone had given it to us). Muzzy is similar in that it is totally in Spanish.  However, Muzzy is much longer of a show... more like a movie, and it never went over well with the kids b/c of the length and that it was all in Spanish... especially my older one (my 8 yr old)... she just wanted to watch it in English which defeats the purpose if that's all you do.  This Mouse show is much shorter... only about 30 minutes, so it is much more manageable.  It was just the right length for my 5 yr old daughter. However, it was quite expensive a video for only 30 minutes.  I do like the fact that there are several short videos you can purchase separately, but they should be far less expensive, since they are so short.  As opposed to Muzzy, which is quite pricey, but you do get everything and there is no more purchasing to do (too expensive, yes. But I did not purchase it myself, so I can't complain). The other difference from Muzzy is the level of interaction (there is NO interaction with Muzzy)... this was far better and my daughter took to it very well. The mouse was just too cute for anyone not to like.  The mouse was constantly hiding & we had to look for him... my 5 yr old loved it, even if she didn't respond, I think she totally got into it.  Now we just need to see if my 8 yr old will like it too.

My only regret is that we hadn't tried this series earlier... I think it would have been an even bigger hit with the younger crowd.  Since my girls are on the older end of the age range, I don't know if I will purchase many more videos, but I think we can get one more out of it before they outgrow it.  Looking forward to watching more of this one!",1366070400,3,3905,4.126816380449141

Good production values and a good mix of actors and animation.
They introduce a lesson, then incorporate it in a pleasant song and dance.
They go through some adjectives (above, below, etc.), rooms of the house, and fruit.
Excellent for kid's first Spanish lesson (and the parents too!).

3877016,5,B0029KN8BC,"I wanted to get my 3 year old son learning another language as early as possible, but without knowing any Spanish myself, I went the DVD route. I researched a number of different Spanish for kids educational movies before selecting this one, and I have not been disappointed. This uses immersion as opposed to translation, meaning the entire movie is in Spanish.

""Inside and Out"" DVD is the fourth one of this series we have purchased.  There's a lady named Maria who does most of the talking and interacting with the kids in the video.  The movie connects with kids by introducing a mouse named Fritzi who my son loves!  It's a very entertaining and engaging way to introduce a new language to small children.",1354924800,,711,4.664

However, after hearing a lot about this DVD, I borrowed a copy from our local library and watched it myself.  It is very well done.  The actor speaks very slowly and clearly, scenes don't change rapidly (huge positive), combination of puppets and actual kids in the scenes make it interesting for the kids.  After watching and downloading the lesson plans from their website, I decided to let me 3.5 year old and 1 year old watch it.  The first time they watched it, it was absolute silence for 25 minutes.  The second time they started participating to some extent.  From then on, they started interacting and singing (to some extent) and dancing. My 3.5 year old has picked up on Animal names and numbers within a week of watching it once everyday for the whole week.  That is a huge positive for me.  After watching this DVD, I borrowed WhistleFritz's Los Animales.  It is not the same.  I did not let my kids watch that, nor would I recommend that to anyone. Their Vamos a jugar is also well done.  I will let my kids watch that :).",1354579200,,1127,4.386473429951691

3877022,5,B0029KN8BC,"I thought this DVD was very well done. I love the way that they use a very natural language. The teacher (Maria) and the kids have a very neutral accent and Fritzie adds a fun touch. Maria is very exaggerated in her gestures and facial expressions, but not overly so. Just enough to easily get the point across.
Typically, the Maria will use a word in a sentence and then review a particular word with the participation of the children in the program. I like the fact that the kids repeat the words so that it's a little less intimidating for my young ones to participate.
The program also uses a lot songs which are very closely related to the topic and words being used in that particular section, Love that! The songs are clear and easy to follow.

The pros:
Good Repetition (by both kids and teacher)
Clear pronunciation
Full Immersion (really the most effective way to learn)
Fun backgrounds and scenery
Good, easy to understand songs

The cons:
No Subtitles (as others have said, would help improve connection with the language)
not very interactive, wish it encouraged my 4 year old to participate more.

The people who put together these DVDs obviously put a lot of thought into it, and the DVDs are entertaining and lively.  The singing is the best part, and Maria and the kids are great too.

3877038,5,B0029KN8BC,"Background, I'm 63 and have two grandchildren.  I'm learning Spanish because I want to keep the gray cells going and because I travel to Mexico frequently and plan to travel to other places in South America for the adventure.  I want my grandchildren to learn Spanish because it is a gift that I can give them that will continue to give for the rest of their lives.  My grandson, age 1 1/2 is in love with Maria.  At this point, about half of his vocabulary is Spanish.  Now understand, I use it frequently to give reinforcement, but still.  There are many words he doesn't know in English that he knows in Spanish.  He walks and touches trees, ""arbol"", he tells us where he wants to go, ""alli"", grapes, ""uvas"", and so forth. He responds to the DVD's and is in love with Maria.  Frequently we drive between Kansas City and Topeka and he watches one of them in the car, or watches one early in the morning eating breakfast, he can't seem to get enough.  Then we have an almost 4 year old granddaughter who actually goes to classes a day a week.  Her teacher from El Salvador is amazed because Lauren has no accent.  She also knows the words in these DVD's and others.  She actually understands quite a bit of Spanish at this point.  These DVD's by themselves aren't going to make your children bilingual, but they have good fundamental concepts and are well thought out.  They are interesting and I find that I learn from them as well.  I hope that they continue to add to the library with new titles.  Beyond these, a more advanced DVD to consider is the Muzzy DVD's.  Then, the books by Ana Lomba are great as well, maybe fantastic.  And they are even better as an iPad app.  Everything reinforces everything else, and after a while your child will reach ""critical mass"" where they have the fundamental understanding of how the language works.",1329782400,4,1844,4.5

We have a Sesame Street one that is completely in Spanish, which is not intended to TEACH Spanish, it is actually FOR Spanish-speaking children. That one is helpful, but way over my children's heads. They speak Spanish too quickly for my kids to follow. We have another dvd (Frank and Paco) that uses both English and Spanish, which TEACHES Spanish words. It's good, but not as good as ""Spanish for Kids:Adentro y Afuera."" This is our favorite dvd because it is entirely in Spanish, no English at all, but the characters speak slowly and use basic words that are easy to pick up. I have 3 children ages, 1, 2 and 3 1/2 and they all love it! They keep begging me to play it over and over again. They are picking up the language so quickly and I am improving my Spanish as well. It is perfect for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers (and adults like me). It teaches concepts like inside, outside, on top of, rooms in the house, foods and much more. It uses practical Spanish that is easy to include in conversation later. I have learned more words that I can use with them on a daily basis. They love the little mouse and it's actually very cute and entertaining. I definitely recommend this video.

I have several other videos that are not from this company and they are not entertaining, and my kids lose interest quickly. With Whistlefritz videos, my kids are glued to the screen and actively learning Spanish. In this video, Adentro y Afurea, the kids repeat the words, answer questions, sing songs, participate in games, and are encouraged to interact with the characters on the screen.
This particular video is very educational because it also has the word written at the bottom of the screen. It has children in the video, cartoons, and my kids love it!

If you're going to just buy one of the DVD's buy this one. It has the best and most vocab and is extrememly easy to understand even if you've never heard Spanish in your life. I've had some Spanish and my husband hasn't had any and he was able to pick things up easily. I agree with others that this series is way to SHORT!!

Luckily they have a song section so I don't have to fish thorough the tape to replay it 100 times like she requested. I bought the whole series and am hoping to freshen up my spanish as well. My concern is that I don't think it will make her learn spanish enough to make her bilingual....she will learn some but it cannot replace a teacher or parent who is fluent and unfortunately I am not. I bought books too to read to her in spanish. I read well in spanish but my speaking is not so good. Interaction needed for fluency.

I hired a babysitter who comes three times a week and talks to her in Spanish only. In addition to that, I got this DVD for her to watch so that she will hear Spanish from another source as well.
I limit my daughter`s television time to 2 30-minute shows a day. She loves Caillou, Dora the Explorer and some other HUngarian DVD-s but ever since we got this DVD (which was 2 weeks ago), that is all she wants to watch!
She calls Fritzi the `Spanish mouse`.
She is totally captivated by Maria, the songs, the puppets, the kids and Fritzi of course . :-)
I am a language teacher myself (ESL and French) and I have to say that the show is brilliant! I love how it is put together and how much repetition there is in it under different scenarios.
I am about to order some other dvds from the same series as well.
I agree with another review that mentioned that the preschool age is the best time to start teaching languages.
It was amazing for me to see that my daughter watched the whole show the first time , DESPITE the fact that she did not understand a thing they said. And she still keeps watching ......... only now, 2 weeks later, she counts to ten, knows the names of the rooms in the house, names of certain fruits etc.

8357862,3,B0029KN8BC,"I'm a 32 year old attorney who lives in NYC. As most of you know, the city has a large Latino population. Although my particular position doesn't entail interacting with Hispanic clients, I still thin it's important for me to learn Spanish. I took Spanish in high school and college- I forgot 90% of it. Sometimes, I'm too tired and lazy to actually look at a textbook. With that in mind, I purchased this DVD. I can watch a few minutes of it before I go to bed (I'm going to eventually buy the whole series). Doing so will refresh my memory. It won't be enough for me to run for mayor of Madrid, but it'll be enough for me to have short interactions with Hispanic people.

Obviously, I wasn't the intended audience, but there aren't a lot of decent Spanish DVDs. This DVD is definitely worth purchasing. However, it has one major flaw. The attractive female presenter only speaks in Spanish. It's good since it forces me to actively engage in the program rather to just let my mind drift. However, it can be confusing if you've never taken Spanish before. Despite that flaw, I recommend this DVD.",1515283200,,1097,4.5125628140703515
8357863,2,B0029KN8BC,A little hard for my young kiddos ages 5 and 6 who are learning the basics. The video is only in Spanish and doesn't give any translation. Sadly I cannot help!,1511827200,,159,4.161290322580645

8357865,1,B0029KN8BC,My 3.5 year old is loving Fritzie and I'm loving watching him have fun learning my native language. I would give this 5 stars if it wasn't for the fact that we've only watched it 3x and it's already skipping. I don't understand why since it hasn't been mishandled and it went from the DVD case to the player. I want to buy the whole kit but now I'm doubtful of its quality. So disappointed.,1500681600,,390,4.213333333333333
