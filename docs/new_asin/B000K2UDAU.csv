8154205,5,B000K2UDAU,"as an avid dancer, and contest dancer, I was introduced to dancing, by Grant Austin, and his father's studio instructors.  I came to appreciate the skill gained when you have great instruction. If you want excellent basics, which are the building blocks for intermediate and advanced, dancing, this is the collection for you.  many studios use pirated copies of these dvds for their personal instruction.  I personally have every dvd produced by grant Austin, and cherish each one. cw has 6 disciplines....two step, polka, waltz, west coast swing, east coast swing, and cha cha.  any questions, write me.  w.pierce@grandecom.net",1407024000,,628,5.303030303030303
