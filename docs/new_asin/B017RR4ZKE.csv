7515371,2,B017RR4ZKE,"While I LOVED the movie Faith Like Potatoes (same producers directed it) ...this movie left me lacking.

Faith Like Potatoes was superb.

This movie just fell flat for me.

I wasn't invested in the characters....their story wasn't developed fully to really draw me in.

For lack of a better description....the story line was just disjointed in so many places. It'd skip forward a few years and you're left wondering how they got from here to there.... what transpired in their life in that time frame etc etc.

The back story was touched upon here and there but wasn't really delved into to give you a real good feel for the characters in regards to what makes them tick...how they feel about things.

It was disappointing.",1474416000,,723,4.744

in the Lord.  The filming was nice as well and I can't get enough of South African accents.

7515458,4,B017RR4ZKE,This is an inspiring movie of a young orphan who has to develop persistence to overcome a string of hardship in his life. It takes place in South Africa and shows the kindness of people especially that of the native people of South Africa who love this white boy and care for him when he is abandoned. Later he returns the care in helping others. It has a Christian focus but is not heavy handed in it's message.,1457568000,6,412,4.294871794871795
7515459,5,B017RR4ZKE,"Faith Like Potatoes is my wife's very favorite movie.  We looked forward to another by the same folks.  While it hasn't replaced Faith Like Potatoes on the top of the list, we still very much enjoyed it and have watched it twice already.

7515536,5,B017RR4ZKE,"Powerfully intense, realistic, and moving. Against impossible odds, a man deals with pain at many levels and is faced with the reality of what true faith is and isn't through relationship flaws, circumstances beyond all control, and hidden anger from life's hard knocks.
