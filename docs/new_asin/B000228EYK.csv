2056194,1,B000228EYK,"The Goodbye Girl is one of my favorite movies ever. I think the script is brilliant, however, I believe this movie proves how important it is to cast actors that actually fit the roles they are playing. I think Jeff Daniels is a gifted actor, but you would never know that by watching this movie. Patricia Heaton has proved herself to be a great sitcom actor, but I have doubts about her transition to leading lady. The original film is a hard act to follow. Both Dreyfus and Mason are award winning, seasoned actors who have the perfect edge to pull off playing these cynical yet endearing characters. I may have a sligt bias towards Richard Dreyfus, as I think he is one of the greatest actors out of the 70's, but if Jeff Daniels had made me laugh even once, I'd have no problem in admitting that he was great as his predesessor. That just didn't happen. Patricia Heaton was even less funny. I only hope that most people who have seen this version of the Goodbye Girl realize that it's a remake and are smart enough to watch the original.",1122768000,8,1041,4.427083333333333
2056195,1,B000228EYK,"Boy, is this remake a dud. Jeff Daniels is seriously miscast (he is too old for the part).  But the worst thing is the rewriting of Simon's great script. By making it politically correct the rewriter has made many of the best jokes disappear or unrecognizable.  Save your time and watch the Herbert Ross film again now that it is out on DVD.",1118016000,6,341,4.396825396825397
2056196,1,B000228EYK,"This remake merely serves to highlight the talent of Mr. Richard Dreyfuss; he makes it look so effortless when essaying the role of Elliot Garfield.  Jeff Daniels seems to be torn between mimicking Dreyfuss and giving up.  I vote for Option 2, as he's lost at sea without a compass in this ""performance.""  Imagine a remake of The Godfather with Don Corleone portrayed by Ryan Seacrest and you're starting to get the flavor of this misbegotten misfire.  Patricia Heaton was, I must admit (given her television work), surprisingly effective, equal to or better than Marsha Mason in the original.  She earns this reviewer's single star awarded.  Brava!  In the end, all I want is the reason this ""remake"" was made in the first place, other than the expectation of it turning a profit, however meager.",1096329600,4,797,4.859259259259259
2056197,2,B000228EYK,"I saw this in TV, it ia a pale imitation of the original.  Jeff Daniels (usually a great actor) tries to do an imitation of Richard Dryfuss.  Great script.",1090713600,4,155,4.310344827586207
2056198,1,B000228EYK,"Despite being a serious Jeff Daniels fan, I cannot for the life of me figure out why some idiot decided that this movie needed to be remade (sadly, it appears that the idiot in question was none other than Neil Simon, himself). The 1977 Richard Dreyfuss/Marsha Mason original far outshines this version in every respect. Maybe I've seen it too many times. Maybe I've got a 25-year long crush on Richard Dreyfuss. And maybe if I hadn't loved that movie so much and saw the remake first I'd feel differently -- but I really doubt it. Okay, it's watchable. Just. Thus a single star. But this will NOT be one for the ages. Do yourself a favour -- get the original.",1089072000,7,660,4.462809917355372
2056199,2,B000228EYK,"I remember it well. It was 1977 and I was 8 and seeing my second adult movie-the first one was Jaws. Hopefully we are all on the same page now with what I mean by ""adult""-suffice to say this was one of the few films I saw at the time that didn't have singing animals or Jodie Foster in it.
Anyways, I remember thinking Marsha Mason was funny, Quinn Cummings was incredibly cool and Richard Dreyfuss-sigh. I was just in love. Who could forget his immortal line reading of ""And-I-don't-like-the panties-drying-on the line?""
Why am I mired in the past you ask? Because so is this movie. This is-I think-the only work Neil Simon wrote specifically for the screen. TNT remade it word for word and sometimes scene for scene. The apartment the two characters fight over even looks exactly the same. Jeff Daniels seems to be channeling the spirit of Richard Dreyfuss-to be fair it would be hard not to. Patricia Richardson is no Marsha Mason. Marsha was bitchier than Pat in the role but you also felt how profoundly hurt she had been. Richardson just seems annoyed and is just not as funny. And you need to be funny to deliver the bitchy bon mots Simon scripted especially for then-wife Mason or you just look...bitchy. Hallie Eisenberg fares the best as Richardson's wise beyond her years daughter (the role originally played by Quinn Cummings.)
Watching this when it aired on TNT, I felt a longing to turn it off and watch the original again. Which I see Amazon carries as well. Hmmmm.....",1082937600,4,1484,4.625

2056203,3,B000228EYK,"This is a painful review to write as I am a big fan of Jeff Daniels.  My biggest complaint here is that the actors (Personally, having seen Richard Benjamin's acting and directing before - I believe it's more he than they who) don't understand the one simple truth:  With a Neil Simon script, you don't have to work for the laugh if you give proper attention to the set-up.  It gets a three ONLY because the writing is so spectacular.  Skip this gosh-awful wannabe and go for the original with Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason.",1382918400,3,528,4.526315789473684

2056207,4,B000228EYK,"I enjoyed the plot of Neil Simon's ""The Goodbye Girl."" But one thing about the original 1977 film always bothered me-- and I had a BIG problem with it. My big problem was, and still  is, Marsha Mason, the former Mrs. Neil Simon herself and his frequent creative muse. For some reason I can't clearly define, Marsha Mason ANNOYS the hell out of me and I don't care for her in leading roles. So I much prefer this 2004 TV version with Patricia Heaton  (""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" ""The Middle"") as Paula, a divorced mother of 10 year old Lucy (Hallie Kate Eisenberg),  forced to share an apartment with actor Elliott Garfield (Jeff Daniels) after her callous ex-boyfriend Tony dumps her; draining her bank account and leaving New York City to make an Italian movie.  Ironically, Marsha Mason makes guest appearances  on ""The Middle"" as Patricia Heaton's mother.
  Those worried about an inferior remake have nothing to fear. Neil Simon has left his original 1977 screenplay intact; making very few, if any,  noticeable changes in his sharp, funny dialogue or the plot. Hey, it wasn't broke, so there is no need for Simon to fix it. ""The Goodbye Girl""  even  had yet another incarnation as a Broadway musical; with Bernadette Peters as Paula and Martin Short as Elliott. That version may have been difficult to take, as I find it impossible to believe any girl would find Short a charming room-mate; or fall in love with him by the last act, for that matter.
  Richard Dreyfuss won an Academy Award for his performance as Elliott in 1977. Jeff Daniels (""The Purple Rose Of Cairo"", ""101 Dalmations"") retains Dreyfuss' beard, but slips easily and effortlessly into the role of Elliott. Daniels and Heaton share an easy-breezy chemistry, which is crucial, because the plot depends on comic and romantic chemistry between Paula and Elliott. Daniels and Heaton are charming as they banter, bicker, and fall in love; just charming enough to make you forget about Dreyfuss and Mason, or at least be glad you watched this delightful ""revival."" In addition, Alan Cumming (""Cabaret"", ""The Good Wife"") steals scenes as a theatre director from Mars who insists that struggling actor Elliott play Richard as over-the-top gay in a, mercifully, Off-Off Broadway production of Shakespeare's ""Richard III.""",1337212800,2,2285,4.952879581151833
2056208,4,B000228EYK,"I remember when ""The Goodbye Girl"" first came out in 1977. I had just joined up with a new girlfriend and she wanted to see it so off to the local theater we went. I couldn't remember anything about the movie, but when I saw ""the Goodbye Girl"" on the bargain DVD rack. I immediately bought it. Well, it turned out that this was not the same Goodbye Girl. This was a later one produced as a TV movie. Such is life.

""The Goodybye Girl"" is a story of a NYC dancer (Patricia Heaton) who seemed to hook up with NYC actors who leave when they get a better job elsewhere. Well, the latest one moved out and subleased his apartment in which she and her young daughter were living to another actor (Jeff Daniels) who suddenly showed up from Chicago. Naturally, there was a clash of interests with regard to the apartment and the new actor was the legal renter. The matter was uneasily resolved by having him move into his own apartment with her and her daughter occupying a major part of it. Now, proceed through a series of conflicts and episodes and a blooming romance until an eventually happy ending. It's an interesting story and well done. The acting is okay, but not particularly good. The story flows along at a good pace. It's mildly enjoyable watching. I think I'd prefer the original 1977 version.

2056209,1,B000228EYK,"Ironically I did not appreciate the original version when it came out; I was younger and did not pay enough attention.  I got this newer version in a combo pack and thought I was getting the older version, but I wanted to be fair and give it a shake. Heaton and Daniels, while talented and funny people, just do not deliver the high-intensity punch of Mason and Dreyfuss, who play off each others' stress magnificently.  Even the child actress is mixed in better in the older version. Even Alan Cumming was robbed of his luster, which makes me even more sad. The performances lack intensity, stress, neurosis and heat. What was the point in making a clumsy, oatmeal version of an intense movie with perfect performances and casting?",1305244800,,732,4.7109375
2056210,1,B000228EYK,"This was a complete departure from acting where CHEMISTRY was the key ingredient.

Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton were 'bland' at best! All 3 key characters were poor substitutes to execute their character roles.

What once was an ICON in CLASSIC Moive history - was reduced to a hugely unmemorable waste of film RE-making!

No chemistry, No charisma, No Soul and delivered with No HEART - what a HUGE disappointment.

This was film making at it's most BORING!

In my opinion - the TOTAL CHEMISTRY between, Richard Dreyfuss, Marsha Mason and Quinn Cummins WAS a combo TOO good to be replicated - and hey I don't say that about much.

e.g. Sabrina - I luv AudreyH - BUT the Remake - SOOOOO much BETTER without a doubt in my mind!

Stay faithful to the ORIGINAL on this one People!",1264896000,3,781,4.575539568345324

2056212,3,B000228EYK,"Not-bad updating of 1977 Neil Simon/Herbert Ross Oscar-winner. Patricia Heaton delivers what critics like to call a ""winning"" performance as a divorced Broadway gypsy with a young daughter, who keeps falling unluckily in love with self-centered actors. Heaton really conveys her frustrations with life/men, and you really start to feel for her and root for her. Little Hallie Kate Eisenberg, as the daughter, comes off as much more sweeter than Quinn Cummings (whose procociousness in the original film you either loved or hated). Jeff Daniels wisely steers away from channeling Richard Dreyfuss, being more natural and less sitcom-y than his predecessor. The only problem I had with Daniels is his character's performance in the ill-advised ""Richard III"" production: I thought the point was that Elliot was a very *good* actor, lost in a poorly-directed production. Daniel's Elliot plays Richard III as an extremely broad parody. Heaton and Daniels do make cute couple, and thier romantic moments are very convincing. All in all, a pleasant time-killer of a film, with no point except to compare 1977 NYC to a(much prettier)2004 NYC. It does, however, pose the question: were New York actors so underpaid in 2004 as to not be able to afford a cellphone?",1243123200,,1254,5.182266009852217
2056213,3,B000228EYK,"It's a nice movie but how anyone in their right mind can give it a 5 star review? 5 stars means better than great movies and this 2004 tv version of Neil Simon's Goodbye Girl it's definetely not a great movie. Jeff Daniels feels as unconfortable in the part as his out of luck actor character feels playing a gay Richard III, and Patricia  Heaton its ok but not better than in Everybody loves Raymond. I saw the original movie when I was just a kid in the 70's and  enjoy it, seeing it in  the 2004 version yesterday on tv, not much has changed, only celulars falling down the stairs so the phone booth must be used. Fine seeing this new version of Goodbye Girl on tv, but nothing to  email home about it.",1237852800,,705,4.2
2056214,5,B000228EYK,"I first saw this play at the movie theatre with Richard Dryfus and Marsha Mason. I was really too young to understand it at the time. I do know that I did not need to see it again. The story was not difficult to follow and it was a cute story about a woman scorned by failed relationships with earlier roommate (male actors) and she wanted to change her life for the better.

The remake of the movie was really funny. The script stayed very much on cue with the Richard Dryfus movie. But,  I really laughed myself to death on this one. The setting and fashion was more up to date. But I felt that Jeff Daniel played a little less intense a personality than Richard Dryfus. Richard Dryfuss played a little too intense a character. He seemed to be rather rude and self centered, whereas Daniels was more human in my opinion. Especially when the play was being performed. When you see his face in the dressing room after his performance on its opening night! I am laughing as I am writing this, I can still see his expression!

Perhaps being older has made the difference in my viewpoint, but I am so happy to have this movie in my video collections. I am not disappointed, I think it is funny.

2056215,5,B000228EYK,"I bought this for my wife.  She loves the original movie.  she said this one not as good, but the dialog was almost word for word.

2056216,2,B000228EYK,"Except for a very few changes the script for this re-make his identical to the 1978 one which leaves your wondering why make it at all.
The actors do go through their lines at a much quicker pace than on the original, my guess is they did it to fit a 110 minute movie into 90 minutes. I am more of a fan of Heaton/Daniels than Mason/Dreyfuss but the fact is the latter ones were much, much better. Unlike Mason's character which evolved so much in the original, Heaton's character remains exactly the same throught this new version which makes it hard to root for her. Personally I identify her so much with ELR's Deborah that when she started kissing Daniels it felt like she was being unfaithful to Raymond.
My suggestion would have been for them to film Heaton and Daniels while they seat on a couch and watch the original Goodbye Girl, it sure would have been more entertaining than what they came up with.",1188864000,2,910,4.455089820359281
2056217,5,B000228EYK,"This made-for-TV film is one that I felt instantly inclined to pick up on DVD when I came across it on Amazon, due mostly in part to the recognizable and talented cast. Patricia Heaton appeared in a couple movies and landed some guest spots on television series before her breakthrough on ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but this is one of the few films in which she stars. Many sitcom actors experience some difficulty transitioning to film, but Heaton has an apparent ease on camera and performs this role quite well, despite the fact that it is so different from her gig as Debra on ""Raymond."" In fact, any fan of that show who is familiar with Heaton's tough-as-nails, take-no-crap-from-anybody role may be a bit humored to see her in this movie as a character who is bawling over a guy within the first five minutes, but for her it works just fine. Heaton has a definite knack for humor and sarcasm in her acting, which gives her a nice distinction and gives her onscreen success.

""The Goodbye Girl"" is a simple, sweet story of a single mother with a wise-beyond-her-years daughter and a reputation for falling for and being dumped by several actor types. As the sweet but undeniably cliched plot continues, another actor enters her life and shows a definite potential to establish a family with Heaton and her child.

There is not a whole lot to the storyline and therefore not much to really comment on in that aspect, but the cast was well chosen and gives the movie a nice touch. Jeff Daniels is a genuinely funny actor with many humorous scenes here, and young child starlet Hallie Kate Eisenberg (remember those infamous Pepsi commercials?) maintains those classic out-of-control curls and river-deep dimples to give a believable portrayal as Patricia Heaton's 10-year-old daughter. Eisenberg has grown quite a bit since doing all those movies as a tiny little girl, but she works very well alongside Heaton and seems to be doing just fine as a preteen star. It is also nice to see Heaton playing such a large part with a child actress. Of course, she played a devoted and loving mother on ""Raymond,"" but in that show we actually don't see her interacting that much with her kids--it is mostly suggestive that she is with them a lot of the time. This movie has her and Eisenberg interacting all the way through, and the fact that they are more like friends than mother and daughter gives them both some good improvisational material to work with.

In short, ""The Goodbye Girl"" is a movie worth renting or buying if you like the cast and would enjoy seeing a lighthearted and entertaining family story.",1143936000,12,2608,4.7274725274725276

It was just a bit difficult to look at this movie on its own merits instead of looking back and comparing it to the original.

I'm a huge Neil Simon fan and saw The Goodbye Girl in theaters 3 times when it came out in '77, but this is the best example of a good actor not delivering with a brilliant script.  It's like they remade it, but removed the heart.  The actors just walked through it and read lines.  Richard Benjamin directed The Money Pit and My Favorite Year; two smart, funny comedies, so it's baffling why this version REALLY didn't work. If you can't improve on a great movie and it becomes evident during production, everybody involved should just jump ship.
