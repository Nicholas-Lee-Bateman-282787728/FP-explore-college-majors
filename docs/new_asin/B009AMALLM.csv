5300171,3,B009AMALLM,"Just saw ""Paranormal Activity 4"" aka ""PA4"". (THIS IS SPOILER FREE REVIEW) I said this before I will say it again: ""The Paranormal Activity movies is the new Saw."" Yes this series has basically taken over where the Saw series ended.....at least for now. For that each year around Halloween we all go to see the new lately installment of this ongoing franchise. ""PA4"" is what you ask for when going into it: getting a unsettling feeling, objects moving in the background, few characters acting strange, jump scares and a big conclusion. Unfortunately, this is the weakest installment in this franchise so far. It brings nothing new to table I hate to say it. It's all the same. It doesn't live up to it's expectations according to the advertisement. The last film really set the bar high and this one was a bit of a letdown. The film does answers some questions, but at the end it's leave you with even more questions to answer. Overall, ""PA4"" is an okay installment, but don't expect too much from it. See it if your a hardcore fan. See it on it's first weekend. For everyone else see it as a rental. 3 1/2 out of 5.",1350604800,,1115,4.470588235294118

2012; Running time: 88 m.
Starring: Kathryn Newton, Matt Shively, & Katie Featherston; Directed by: Henry Joost & Ariel Schulman

It may be under an hour and a half long, but you feel every minute of this paranormal bore of a movie.  Pretty much all you get is a bunch of annoying footage of empty rooms with a cat running by every so often.  No suspense, no real scares, and a terrible, over-acted performance by Kathryn Newton.  A mildly creepy ending is the only reason this snoozefest earned 2 stars instead of one.  Pass on it.",1483747200,,554,4.555555555555555

5300644,2,B009AMALLM,"Other than lowering the budget the home video conceit serves no purpose whatsoever and it does not benefit the story in any manner.
The only 'jumps' the movie generates are 'non-scare' cuts with a loud, booming drum sound. The actual intended 'scares': ghostly images, knife dropping, witch attack, etc. utterly fail in generating scares and mostly cause an outraged reaction: ""Is that supposed to be scary?"" The story is all over the place, and all motivation remains utterly obscure. If the coven wanted these people dead, there are probably easier and more direct ways to do it. If the wanted the kid, why put it up for adoption in the first place? Where did the multiple witches come from and why are they demon faced? The movie fails to shed any light on anything.

Only reason I saw it it was recommended in the BMF podcast. I doubt I will bother with any more installments. I liked the first well enough, even if I was not overly impressed with it.

It has been five years since the disappearance of Katie and Hunter, and a suburban family witness strange events in their neighborhood when a woman and a mysterious child move in.

What did I think?

Having played every one of their suspense tricks in the first three installments, the Paranormal Activity franchise takes a different tack in the fourth by turning it into a game. With viewers now expecting subtle movement in the peripheries, the makers taunt us with long shots to get the audience guessing what (if anything) will happen. Surprisingly it works well, especially with a few added laughs.

Nowhere near as scary as any of the first three, its an okay addition but doesnt auger well for a fifth.",1431820800,,726,4.784

I have enjoyed all of the P.A. movies since the beginning so when this one came out I was sure I would like it. As it turns out I did but like all of the rest I just liked it, it was just as good as the previous ones. When this one came out I was a little less interested I will admit, but still I had to see it since I liked the others. So when it was released I checked it out and like I thought it was good and I was glad to add it to the collection.

This one follows a family who have some new neighbors move in. As it turns out it is a single mother and son and both are a little weird. The boy in particular is strange but when strange things start to happen and Alex and her boyfriend start to notice something is off with the boys mother it becomes life or death. Also what is happening to her younger brother?

The acting, writing and directing are all good here and follow along with the others nicely in the series. This film is not better or any worse than the others. To be honest I would have to watch them all again in order to even begin to think about ranking them since I really have only watched each one once or twice.

Finally, add a really cute blonde lead actress with gorgeous blue eyes and mix it all up and what do you get?  You get one huge dud of a movie that manages to keep your attention throughout the entire movie while you hope for some hidden redeeming quality.  At least I didn't pay for this one.

It's hard to explain how something can be both excruciatingly boring and intensly exciting at the same time, but somehow they manage to pull this off in my brain. The waiting in anticipation is not unlike the technique employed in many Spaghetti Westerns of the long slow build-up to the gunfight. As for 4, I had mixed feelings on this one: Best acting of any yet, and characters I actually started to care about. Least scares and recoils from the screen. This is a formula film and the problem with that is that once you know the formula, it is difficult to recapture the same shock value again and again.

5301257,1,B009AMALLM,"Short version, it's a horrible movie. No good scares, no logical story, nothing of interest at all actually. I guess the acting wasn't atrocious, but it wasn't good enough to make the rest of the movie worth while.

The long version(very long version). I have watched a lot of horror films in the last few weeks. I have a lot of time at night to sit back and see what each one brings to the table. I'll be upfront with this, I have not watched any of the other paranormal activity films with the exception of the first half, and last 10 minutes of the first one. I got bored and fell asleep so I honestly don't know if it was actually scary and I just missed all the good scares, or if it was just as boring and lame as I think it is. Regardless, this review will be from someone that isn't reviewing based on the series, just on the movie itself.

It starts off with I'm guessing footage from the film before or something. Something about a woman and her son get a visit from her sister, then stuff gets crazy and apparently she-hulk (the sister) throws lady against camera and takes her son, then they disappear.

Next we jump to the main character, a 15 year old girl, which immediately sucks, cause at least with bad horror movies they usually have some hot lead characters that you can enjoy, but in this case it's just creepy. It gets more creepy when she starts recording everything that's happening in the house without her family knowing. (additionally the only bath scene is with the 7 year old little brother, so...yeah...)

Well, the entire story is some demon shenanigans about she-hulk and some new boy (apparently hunter disappeared or something, demons suck at keeping track of children, who knew?) moving in across the street from Alex(aka not legal yet) and her family. Over time the boy across the street (robby I think) starts coming over and becomes friends with not-quite-legal's little brother. Even more shenanigans ensue as well as a demon summoning and that brings us to the last bit of the movie. This is where the ""spoilers"" really come in I guess.

So at a point earlier in the movie not-legal sees a bunch of cars at their neighbors house, this confuses her because supposedly her neighbor is sick which is the reason robby is staying over at their house. So she follows her nose and gets scared away when asked if she needs help. This doesn't really matter unless you feel like trying to get some kind of meaning out of the ending(what little there is to be gotten). Jump back forward and everyone is dead in really boring and not scary ways with the exception of not-legal's dad who goes over to the neighbors house to make sure everyone is ok after seeing his son and their neighbor going into the house, and not-legal who gets smacked basically through a door by a ghost and then somehow gets out of the house and to the neighbors house with no problems. She goes in to find her brother and dad only to see her dad getting dragged through the halls and then vanishing. She gets chased out of the house by the neighbor who looks like a vampire or something, finds her brother, and then a whole lot of vampire looking things (I'm guessing they're demons, I don't know) only to get disappeared by neighbor demon lady.",1417046400,3,3248,4.498305084745763

5301259,3,B009AMALLM,"The Plot: A continuation from the 2nd movie, PA4 picks up after katie takes hunter away and we are left without any additional information. however, there are a lot of holes in the plot that aren't explained. [SPOILERS] Why didn't katie keep hunter? how is she not being pursued for the death of micah and her sister and their family? why would an paranormal being not be able to manage taking care of a kid? why does he need the kid? why not bring the kid to the grand ma or any of the other women in the coven? The current people in charge of the franchise are saying that there is an endgame, but i think that is bull poop.

Acting: Worst acting in a PA4 movie thus far. By this i mainly mean the blonde girl. Who roles their eyes when you think someone is in the house or that scary s*** is happening?

Overall: Despite my complaints, the movie was watchable provided you don't start asking questions. Also, while a lot of cinema snobs complain about the PA movies - i've always like the ""less is more"" approach. Suspense, instead of gore and not being able to see what is there. This makes the monster alive in your imagination and, as a result, i find them typically creepy and scary and they make me smile uncomfortably after i watched them and went home and there is a noise in my house. That being said, the set up and ""boo"" scares are predictable and fatigue is setting in for the franchise. Still, enjoyable.",1416268800,,1419,4.350943396226415

What do they do with the male children once possessed? In PA3 the book mentioned male sons being given away.  So the girls give away your son to be possessed, and then what? What's so special about the boys and not the girls? Since Katie was possessed, if her offspring were a boy or girl it shouldn't matter, and if it does they have shown no difference. I'm guessing the point is world domination to make everyone evil? I'm trying to get more of a back story to this coven thing, and they way they are dragging out the explanation there will probably be five more PA movies. I would think with all of the powers the possessed have they could make people possessed by demons a bit more faster, like a production assembly line.

True..the found footage genre does come with a 'Please suspend belief' note on the door,but still..its good.

There's no argument that the first was the best,its true of most films,especially in the horror genre (Halloween,Saw,Scream)...and yes,i understand that Aliens was terrific adventure,s if you want to say 'hey,hold up a minute,i got one.."" then thats fine. i prefer the original for being a bit simpler,and claustrophobic. Not to mention i love the last scene of Ash's (no,i won't spoil it)

Back to the P.A seriesL 2 was a good lazy saturday movie,offering a few chills and a creepy last 10 minutes. i especially liked the one jolt in the kitchen. But i didn't find myself as sleepless as i was after watching the first movie. It still plays on me when i re-watch it. And it took so long for PA2 to get moving...i guess i realize it was good,but it had a hard act to follow. Very technically well done,i cant take that away from the filmmakers.

4 stretches the plausibility of how many situations the people would actually keep filming,but the creep factor is still there. Perhaps its even disturbing how normal Katie acts when we know the truth. The film poses new questions and leaves you to put them together-or at least until they answer them for you in a later installment. What i like about this one is,theres alot of stuff that happens in the day...and that leaves you unnerved. Even as i type this review i find myself just looking behind me...

I usually don't rate movies, but this one was just TERRIBLE!
I found myself asking ""Why"" a lot. When characters do things in a movie that go against common sense, you have to wonder...did the people who made this film think we're THAT stupid to not notice? And why the predictability? The bouncing ball down the stairs....the ""scare"" tactics used during long pauses in the film... the levitating scene...the ""parents"" that are so removed from their kids (yet the mother is a-okay taking a stranger's kid into her own home for an indefinite amount of time)....the length of time it takes for Alex to DO SOMETHING about what is happening in her family's house...its just bad.

In addition to all of this, the time it takes for things to pick up in the film is just ridiculous. Fast forward to the final 10 minutes. There you have it. I only watched up to Night #3 (watching all the scenes in between seemed pointless) and found myself getting bored.

One of the biggest and most noticeable fails in the movie is when Alex is in her neighbor's house and the possessed Katie is charging at her down a dark hall. The scene initially show Katie's shirt is black. But when Alex closes the door and Katie tries to break it down, the shirt Katie is wearing is white. Yeah. That did it for me. So much for it being based on ""actual events."" Just terrible.

Since I don't like giving details of a movie because each person has their own views and taste.  I can't explain more about having more questions.  All in all, the movie is of basically the same scenario, scares, sultities, and dangers happening to the characters.  WIth the title being Paranormal Activity, they could of made this movie totally different within the realm of paranormal and I probably would have enjoyed it more and would have been able to focus and care about the characters, but since I had a strong notion as to what was going to happen, it was something to watch while I was doing other things.",1403049600,,995,4.5251396648044695

Creepy noises - check; creepy eyed kid - check; imaginary friend - check; nightvision cameras - check; broken neck - check; levitating - check; tossed into a wall - check; and on and on.

There's either a NAMBLA convention in town or a pedophile devil coven in the neighborhood looking for fresh young meat. ""Katie"" with the help of Robbie and a band of demonic Stepford wives, latch onto a dysfunctional family with a young boy. The gullible family who barely parent their own kids take in Robbie when his mom goes to the hospital. Teenager ""Alex"" and her boyfriend Ben begin to tape everything because Robbie is so darn creepy and the hijinks ensue.

It runs the same course as the previous 3 movies except the ""scares"" in this movie aren't so much scary as they are predictable up to and including the obligatory neck break and wall toss.

The first 3 installment were very streamlind & simple in their delivery, and were very effective in that.  That was in essence how this was delivered.
  But the let down with this installment is as follows: it just didn't give the usuall scare that the other three did.  Normally the first half of the film, while a bit boring, sets up for the second half of the movie, which delivers the growing horror & scare.  In this case, the scare wasn't that great.

5302114,1,B009AMALLM,"I enjoyed the original Paranormal Activity very much. I loved that it let your mind make things scary instead of just presenting ever more gore like most other horror movies do. I have come to realize over time though that the things that made the first one so scary were, in addition to only letting you see just enough to have you on the edge of your seat, its pacing and the mystery behind the whole thing - it was only in the second one that they actually tried to make a plot. The sheer visceral impact of it was terrifying if you watched it attentively and in a dark quiet room.

The second one lost a lot of its scares by having many cameras, thus losing the limited perspective which helped keep your mind wondering what ""that shadow"" was that you may have just seen. 3 was a bit better since it went back to basics but the cat was already out of the bag. Knowing what to expect meant that we didn't care so much what that shadow was anymore.

Now we have PA4. I will usually admit that scary movies are more scary to most people than they are to me since I have been watching them since I was 6 years old and have seen hundreds. In this case, however, I can honestly say that this is just not at all scary. Outright boring in fact. Not only is the cat still out of the bag in terms of story, plus we have many cameras again, but there really isn't anything actually happening here. That's right, not only little paranormal activity but little activity at all. None of the characters matter. Nothing they do matters. It is just people walking around, some shots of them sleeping, a very unnecessary XBOX Kinect endorsement, and really nothing to even tie it to the old story line in the end.

I didn't expect much from it and I am sure you aren't either but if you are just looking for a horror to watch then go re-watch Alien or The Descent if you want to be scared, Evil Dead 2 if you want something silly and campy, or the Sixth Sense if you want something more dramatic and thoughtful.

5302117,1,B009AMALLM,"Why do we need so many sequels when they all go nowhere?  The first Paranormal Activity was the best first person found footage film since the Blair Witch Project, and has since kept that mantle from the legion of imitators that have followed, including its own sequels.  While I believe the third film had much the same atmosphere and creep factor as the first, it's like the others aren't even trying.  The acting is lame, the scares are predictable and the end is underwhelming, but segues into yet another numbered iteration that will fall out of Hollywood's rear soon enough.  I like watching most bad horror movies, but this one was so boring that it wasn't even fun.  You can watch the first and the third, but watching any of the others will be a waste of time as you'll just forget them for how little they affect you.",1392595200,,827,4.523489932885906

I keep hoping the franchise will become better, but it really doesn't.  We've seen all this sort of stuff before in the first 3, and those were better films.  Not much, but a little.

This movie could have been so much better.  The mysterious boy across the street befriending the boy in the household was a good premise, but poorly executed.  I began to become annoyed that this line was going absolutely nowhere.  The filming in the XBOX mode got old REALLY fast, and the whining girl became tedious early on.

But the ending...good grief...did ANYBODY working on this script NOT know how the third one ended?  This ended no differently and nothing was learned by the audience.  Nothing was learned and nothing was gained.

This film felt to me like someone saw the first three, handed the DVD's to a film-making pal and said, ""Here, make a fourth.""

That's it.

There was nothing new or interesting here.

The only good part in all of this was that I didn't find the actors painful to watch.  Mostly.  They really gave this lame script their best and I applaud them for that.

For this alone it is worth taking a peak at, just if you enjoy jumping and such, if still at cheap price. (I paid $7.99 and would not recommend more than that, the $5 bin would have been better.)  As part of the franchise, I will admit it was weak. It is as if they made a movie and remembered it was suppose to be a sequel.  It was confusing as to how it all connected at first and......SPOILER ALERT.....PLEASE DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW PLOT POINTS.... I am still trying to figure out how the baby nephew of Katie that she kidnapped (Hunter)  was the kid not living with her and who was the kid living with her? And Katie was ""hospitalized"" and not about for half of the movie, and when taken to the hospital by trained professionals, I can assume, they left a small child alone to wander about the neighborhood waiting to be taken in. No children's services. Did we go a hundred years back in time?  And who was the little apparition that followed the boys when they were also talking to the larger one, who I assume was our ""beloved"" Toby.  When Katie did show up, was she possessed only sometimes and semi-possessed others?  What was her deal?  The ending was....well where did all the women come from?  They really need to pin down how many they consider to be in a witch's coven, because that looked like far too many...or maybe they are just going for an all female demonic cult now. Taking out the very few ""Paranormal Activity"" threads, it could have been a good spooky movie on its own.  Maybe that was what they meant to do then became afraid people would compare it to their other movies so threw in the junk from ""Paranormal Activity"".  That makes more sense than this being an update of what happened to Katie and Hunter, because little was learned there.

5302349,3,B009AMALLM,"""Paranormal Activity 4"" is a return to the franchise's continuity after flashing back to the sisters' origins in the third installment, who were the subject of ""Paranormal Activity"" one and two.  We're back in the timeline to determine what happened to Hunter and Katie from the second film.

But before we get that far, we see the terror of demonic possession through fresh eyes: attractive teenager Alex (Kathryn Newton) lives in Henderson, Nevada with mother Holly (Alexondra Lee), father Doug (Stephen Dunham), and little brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). Alex is fond of video chatting with her ""only a friend"" Ben (Matt Shively) who is smart enough to keep his mouth shut when Alex frequently shares video of herself in her underwear.

When strange kid Robbie (Brady Allen) befriends next door neighbor Wyatt, things take a turn for the weird. Mysterious noises, telekinesis, and signs of witchcraft abound.  Or to put it another way, they don't call this ""Paranormal Activity"" for nothing.

The strangers across the street are up to no good, of course. Alex tries to get everyone to believe her, but since she's a teenager with an awful mom, this is a difficult thing to do.  One after another the people in her limited circle of family fail her, which eventually leads to a much broader conspiracy of witches.  It's a lot like the evolution of the ""Halloween"" series in which Michael Myers goes from lone psycho killer to a demonic sacrificing machine operating at the behest of a cult.

The big twist in this film is technology, the use of Xbox 360's Kinect motion sensor to show ghosts (or not show them as the case may be). Much of the video recording is from a laptop's point of view, which would be later used successfully in the ""V/H/S"" series.

Although not as thrilling as the first three installments, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" knows the right buttons to push to terrify parents of young children. Everyone else will likely be less impressed.",1389571200,,1955,4.864457831325301

5302602,1,B009AMALLM,"So, I've watched many of the Paranormal Activities. I've seen number 1, and number 2 in the theater. Number 1 because I thought this was going to be a scary movie. Number 2 because I was disappointed in 1 and thought that maybe they learned to make a scary movie (wrong again), and 3 because it's playing on cable.

So why did I watch 4? Because it was free on Amazon Prime, and now that I've seen it, don't waste your time with this terrible movie.

Let's get into the nitty gritty of why you should skip this one.

For starters, I don't get the fans of Paranormal Activity. If you're following it for the story, why do you care about these characters? There's absolutely nothing that makes me as a watcher want to root for any of these people. Nor is there anything truly scary about these films.

Let's sum up what PA4 is all about.

Fake suspense, anti-climax, repetition, fake suspense, anti-climax, repetition, terrible ending.

Fake suspense:

The movie is full of jump scares that are nothing. A cat jumps next to the camera. The friend scares the girl. Someone appears who was out of frame. Instead of making the jump scares have anything to do with the actual ghost and or ""demon"" it tries to scare the audience with the mundane.

Another scene which I thought was going to be awesome and redeem this movie, was when the knife flew up to the ceiling while the mom wasn't looking. This scene alone would have been the perfect opportunity for the knife to: A.) Drop on top of her head and kill her. B.) Drop down and cut her arm. C.) Drop down and have her miss being cut.

You know what happens when the knife goes up to the ceiling?

NOTHING! It cuts to the next scene and continues on from there.

Does the knife eventually drop down? Yes, when the dad is far away and there is absolutely no danger of the knife hitting him.

Which brings us to Anti-Climax.

Everything that happens in this movie is anti-climactic. It's called PARANORMAL Activity right? Well, when that terrible actress Kate shows up, she's pretty much the one that kills off the characters. Let's see... and yes this is spoilers because you shouldn't watch this boring ass movie.

The mom is floated up to the ceiling and then dropped. Wow, what a kill.
The friend has his neck broken by Kate. Oooh, that hasn't been done before!
The father gets dragged into a room and just disappears, so we just have to presume he's dead.
and the girl gets killed by an army of demon women. Okay, that part was... kind of interesting? Except it was the same way the killed off the other characters in PA2. The only difference is that the women were witches.

Oh, repetition, right forgot to cover that. Well basically the movie repeats with showing you a whole lot of NOTHING happening for long stretches of time. Then something barely scary happens, cut to some dialogue and ""Oh my God there's ghosts in the house"" and then another shot of a long stretch of nothing happening and... OH MAN! A LOUD NOISE! WHAT COULD IT BE!?

It's a real shame too, I actually kind of liked the actors that were in this one. The family felt very believable and realistic. I could totally imagining these people being real. Maybe I'm out of touch, but I thought they did an admirable job. (Except for Kate, she was terrible in the first and is still terrible now.)

So if you're bored and you have access to this movie for free whether on Cable, Netflix, Amazon Prime.

Do yourself a favor, watch a GOOD movie and skip this moronic piece of trash.

5302605,1,B009AMALLM,"WOW.  This is what happens when film producers get FAT and LAZY.  Fat off of money that the previous films have made, and lazy with no desire to actually do their jobs well.  Every person responsible for this train wreck (with the exception of the actors, they did their best) should be embarrassed.

I should preface by stating that I am a big fan of Paranormal Activity, the original.  That movie, on a show-string budget, had me pausing at every creak and bang in my house!  Very creepy and well-paced!  The 2nd one was too drawn-out but paid off in the end, and the third one was, in my opinion, almost as good as the first.

Then this worthless piece of garbage was birthed.  The ratings were bad, but I wasn't looking for a masterpiece, just a few good jumps, a crazy last 10 minutes and a continuation of the Katie/Kristi/demon saga.  Instead, we get an extended Hallmark commercial of another  ""all-American"" suburban family living in another McMansion.  We get cheesy home video reenactments of cute little kids doing cheesy cute little kid things.  We get one kid who acts slightly creepy, in a made-for-TV Sci-Fi channel sort-of way.  We get lots and lots of teenage shenanigans, like trying to be cool while making mating overtures (uh, creepy, and not in a good way) while Skype-ing and cursing a lot.  Unfortunately, the teenagers carry A LOT of this movie.  This may be great if you're a typical mainstream teenager.  I'm an adult, so I found this extremely annoying and a waste of my time.

The pacing on this film is not just slow, it's non-existent.  I am not exaggerating when I say that 90% of this film is just teenagers hanging out and trying to be cool and cute kid home videos.  I'm not kidding.

And the aforementioned Katie/Kristi storyline?  This movie took that from eerie and mysterious to corny and ridiculous.

The creepy atmosphere in the other films is gone. Dead. I jumped just twice in this entire film.  The first time was at the very beginning, during the Trick-or-Treat sequence, and again near the very very absolute end.  I'm easy to scare and love things jumping out at me, so this was extremely disappointing. It didn't even seem like a horror movie most of the time.  I mean, I watch a horror movie to be scared, even if only here and there for a few seconds, and this movie can't even do that???  I could've been doing something more exciting, like my nails.

Yeah, so again, I really enjoyed PA I-III.  I absolutely hate this movie and rue the day it was ever conceived as an idea.  It was an hour+ of my life that I can't get back.  If you're smart or you value your money, you'll avoid this.  I haven't given up on the series and will probably check out the ""The Marked Ones"" (finally, a non-white, non-suburban, non-McMansion-living, non-Hallmark commercial family gets haunted!!)...as long as the creators actually gave a damn and did it right.

5302732,2,B009AMALLM,"I'm no horror movie film snob, but I know a bad horror movie when I see one. It's crazy how we're at the fourth movie in the series now, and people still manage to get scared watching these things. In case you haven't figured it out, here's the outline for any Paranormal Activity movie:

-haunted house
-house has tons of cameras set up, be it surveillance cameras or computers with cameras
-ghost in haunted house gradually messes with the residents
-if there's a kid involved, it's either going to be possessed or can communicate with the ghost
-something finally happens in the last 5 minutes and then it's over

That's it. These movies aren't scary, they're just annoying. I don't even know where to really start with this one. Unless you're a young kid who's never seen a horror movie before (let alone spent much time on the internet), there isn't anything here that should get so much as a quiet gasp out of you.

Alex is a young high school girl living with her parents and little  brother in Nevada. She spends a lot of time with her friend Ben and talks to him with a video chat program on her computer. When the two of them go out to a tree house late at night, they find the neighbor's young child, Robbie, all alone. His mom gets sick suddenly and it's up to Alex's family to take care of the little guy. He isn't very sociable and rarely speaks. As the days go on, odd things happen in Alex's house, like objects moving, weird noises, and a knife flying up into the ceiling when someone is preparing dinner. As if that wasn't bad enough, Alex notices a bunch of cars outside Robbie's house one night, though his mom is still in the hospital, AND Robbie drew a mysterious symbol on Alex's brother's back, which is related to witchcraft. That's a good sign, right?

My biggest gripe with this movie is how much of a wasted opportunity it is. The story with Alex and Ben is fairly interesting, considering they're the only two people who are investigating the strange happenings. Alex's parents don't do much aside from the usual mom and dad thing when something strange happens, even when a big chandelier crashes to the ground and almost kills Alex. The kids try to explain things to the parents, and get brushed off like it's no big deal. If more time were spent with these two, who had good chemistry, and less time on long scenes of nothing happening, there could have been a good movie here. The ghost that haunts the house doesn't do a whole lot either. Aside from two incidents, including the chandelier one I just mentioned, all he's really doing is playing small pranks on everyone. Even the third movie, which I consider a bit worse than this one, had a little bit more of a threatening presence with its ghost when it would go after the little girls.

And here's the other big problem with this movie, and also the series as a whole. Because the cameras are in fixed locations, you essentially play a guessing game of where a shadow's going to appear or where something's going to fall. There's no suspense because you're expecting something to happen at any moment, and that's not what horror is. There's one part where they even use a cheap attempt at a scare where a cat jumps in front of the camera. I half-expected him to wink at the camera as if he was going ""gotcha!"". Did anyone else wonder how these laptops were able to record so much footage? Ben explains that his computer automatically saves every single video chat session he has, or whenever the camera's on it keeps recording and saves everything. The same goes for the phones too, I'm guessing, since this is supposed to be a found footage movie, and with half the movie being filmed on a phone...ugh, I need to stop thinking about this one. As dumb as teenagers in horror movies usually are, it didn't make any sense when something pretty big towards the end was happening, and someone was STILL recording with their phone, getting some pretty clear shots while they were running away.

Nothing in the movie scared me, most of the acting was terrible (especially from a returning character), there's too much footage shot in the daytime, and the only cool thing shown isn't even a scare, but a few shots using the Xbox 360's Kinect, with it's infrared tracking dots. Who knew that thing would finally be interesting? The only other thing that bumps the rating up to 2 stars for me is a dumb 'guy' reason, and it's that Alex's mom, played by Alexondra Lee, is pretty dang hot, and when she got some solo screen time, it kept me from falling asleep.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone. I watched it not that long ago, and actually forgot all about it until I went through my Recently Watched queue. If you're not a fan of these movies, Paranormal Activity 4 isn't going to help change your mind.",1385769600,,4790,4.523094688221709

We expect to be scared, and because the tricks are the same each year, we leave going ""That was fun"" instead of ""That was terrific!""--literally and figuratively.

First of all, have never watched the other movies in the series but if it is anything like this, I will avoid them like the plague. My review is basically a review of this movies entertainment value of which it has none.
The use of documentary style camera with dates is totally useless in this movie. You are made to think that this movie shows captured images from paranormal activity investigator cameras. But it doesn't work because this movie is not about a paranormal activity being investigated by professional investigators. They do not exist in this movie. So why do they even bother with this effect?
This movie is basically a mishmash of events that do not help to move the story (if you can call it that) along. The plot plods along with no real build up that you come to expect with horror movies. This movie could have been encapsulated in a fifteen minute span and still get the same result.
This movie is actually boring and I kept on watching it as I waited for it to get better. And it never did. The disappointing ending which I thought did not make sense. It was simply thrown in for sudden shock effect which did not work because of the lack of build up. This reminds me of something right out of a YouTube video that will pop off a sudden growling monster out of nowhere just for a laugh. It's not scary. It's just shocking. But in this movie's case, it is just totally disappointing.
I get the sense that this movie was a simple cash-in on the movie series. I don't know if this movie was shown in theaters but if it was, I can only imagine how angry the movie goer must have felt after sitting through this garbage. I am glad that I did not purchase the dvd version of this movie and simply watched it on Netflix. I could have written a much better movie to call Paranormal Activity 4 than this. Even a schoolchildren can make a more entertaining movie than this. Avoid this movie at all cost.",1383177600,,2103,4.381074168797954

You sit and watch 20 minutes of dialogue just to watch a chair move or a light flicker, and people find that scary?  The only scary thing about this film is that people still pay to see it in the theater.  If you want a real paranormal movie, I would recommend Poltergeist.

5303279,2,B009AMALLM,"While the first film was an outstanding horror flick that quickly ended as the ""suits"" got a hold of the franchise and started cranking out sequels.  There will be some minor spoilers ahead, so you've been warned.

The first film excelled at building up tension and hitting you with something unexpected.  This time, we have the absurd idea of the Kinect Cam watching the living room at all times.  This is the premise for ""seeing"" the activity, motion in the IR dots.  We do get some webcam footage from a laptop, because of course everyone walks around all the time carrying their laptop with the webcam on.

If this wasn't absurd enough, the plot revolves around the child kidnapped in PA2 who shows up next door with her ""mother"" who then goes missing, so of course the police decided ""we'll just let the neighbors watch the kid"".  Even with a movie about the paranormal, this simple bypass of Child Protective Services is a glaring plot sore which is even more unbelievable than the supernatural in the film.  The rest of the movie goes as expected, no twists to throw the audience off.  The ending is a horror cliche as our heroine does something that no one in their right mind would do given the same circumstances.

While the 2nd film essentially set up how the events of the first film happened and the 3rd was a prequel (with plot holes), this 4th installment adds nothing to the franchise as a whole.  I will say our young blonde protagonist does her acting well, considering the thin plot she has to work with.

Because, according to Amazon, three stars means ""it's okay.""  I probably would have said ""it's okay"" would be two stars, ""I don't like it"" would be one star and ""I hate it"" would be no stars.  Why would we give any stars to something we hated.  When you were a kid and you failed a test did you get a star? No.  If you got anything it was a frowny face, crudely drawn in the margin in red ink, that served as cold confirmation that you were turning out to be an intellectual failure and a disappointment to your parents.  But I digress.  I feel like three stars is just too many stars for something that's only ok.  Then I guess three stars would be ""I like it"" and four stars would be ""I love it"" and maybe we could do away with the fifth star altogether.  I mean, do we really need a fifth star?  Who are we trying to impress here?  Rich Hollywood fat cats?  Siskel and Ebert only had two thumbs and they managed to impart their feelings regarding films just fine.

5303357,4,B009AMALLM,"I watched the unrated version before finding the rated version on Netflix. I'm a fan of the PA series, and I highly recommend, if you're a fan, skipping the unrated version and watching the theater release.

As for the theater release, I'm not sure why there's so much hating on this film. It seems to follow the same formula as the others -- an examination of an average family's reaction to paranormal activity in their lives, with a backstory of possession. There are fake scares and practical jokes, just like in the other movies. And there's a tiny parcel of new information about the world we're in, just like in the other movies. Attacks on the family  are as brutal as any we've seen in the other films, perhaps more extreme. So I'm not sure why people see this film as not scary. The main difference in PA4 is that there's someone smart enough -- Alex -- to understand right away that something dangerous has entered their lives. Perhaps that gives the film a less mysterious tone.

These aren't big special effects films. These are films about families and human reactions. Which is why I find them interesting.

The only problem I had with the film relates to bad special effects and the hamhanded use of infrared recording. The recording itself isn't a problem for me. I don't care whether x-box is featured, it makes sense for the film. But the  special effects revealed through infrared are poorly done, to the point of being comical. This is not a small problem; it breaks the mood of the film. But it doesn't mean the entire film should be trashed for it.

I have to give the filmmakers credit for finding new ways to create found footage. I'm curious what they'll come up with for installment #5.",1382313600,,1713,4.6

Seriously, what do they expect us to do when they write that? ""This s***'ll scare the S*** out of them. I'm gonna make the door open."" And then we as the audience go ""Oh God, do you see that? The goddamn door is OPENING!!""? Yeah, it was scary in the first movie because nobody ever made a first person haunting movie, but use it over and over and eventually we'll just laugh at it. Speaking of laughing, I feel bad for saying it, but I laughed when Katie snapped Ben's neck. I don't know why. I also laughed when the mom was thrown around the living room. It was just stupid. Not to mention the cult thing at the end. I mean, in 3 when they had the group of old ladies it was scary, but hundreds of people crowded in a backyard? That's pushing it.

Im not a fan of movies that go beyond the scale of realism such as this film portrays. For example, showing the woman who had vanished in sequel 3 and now she appears as a spook and the ending was terrible.

The problem with todays haunted films and they do not mix realism with it. Many films are based only on special affects.  for example, the exorcist is a great demon type of film where the evil spirit does not show up and disappear out of no where and Amityville horror ( original film) again you never see the spirit, you only get a small glimpse of it.",1381708800,,680,4.255813953488372

I finally got around to watching it for myself today, hoping that it was much better than reviews and word of mouth had advised.  It wasn't.  It isn't.  It's finely acted and the characters are likeable for sure.  The movie's primary failure is that it's mind numbingly boring.  It's a 90 minute movie that felt too long by 15 to 20 minutes.  Nothing happens forever.  And when things do happen, they don't always make a lot of sense.  Why'd the knife fall in front of the dad?  Why'd the girl levitate over the bed?  And the movie squanders what might've been a decent plot twist.  All along there are hints that the mom was complicit with Katie.  Turns out she wasn't at all.  So all those hints were just what, put in there accidentally?  Hmm.

Shame to. Finally we see what became of the Aunt and Hunter and it's a let down.

SPOILERS:

First of all, why on earth was the kidnapped boy put up for adoption? Where did the second boy come from? Why does the boy make funny things happen but never do anything?

Well, my answer is this, the director seems so fixated on his 14 year old actress being in her skimpy sleep-shorts every chance possible that he forgets they are making a movie -- I started to wander just what fascination he had for this girl who is constantly in little shorts and at one point is levitated out of bed for absolutely no reason?

Second, what's with all the hand-held camera work? Obviously these people don't walk around holding the camera out and making sure they film everything, yet that's what happens. The other three films knew the camera's had to be constantly explained and justified, this one doesn't care. I felt like the camera-man was the main character here.

Third, where's the scary parts? The shape of the demon showing on the Xbox kinects dots should have been creepy and instilled dread, instead it was ... uh, whatever. My wife figured out that the kid was adopted and the neighbor kid was not hunter about five-minutes into the film, so when he starts screaming ""i'm not hunter"" but he is, we don't care.

In the first three the little things the evil did seemed to be it pushing it's way through to our world and gaining strength and getting better and better at possession and killing, this time it's just the director moving props to try and startle us.

The director should have just taken his actress and re-made Lolita, since the camera seems obsessed with her anyway. There's no logic to these camera's -- she's got a high-def night-vision camera rolling in perfect frame as she is being chased by a demon through a house trying to follow her being-dragged around father ... that makes sense? The only time the camera works is the one in living room that is stationary and when her smart-phone falls and keeps recording when she is locked in the garage -- the rest of the time we see how lazy the production is by not bothering to justify the footage. Plus, they show way too much when they show it and they re-use all the same tricks to no good effect.

I'm sad to say there's no point in watching this.",1372032000,,2573,4.516129032258065
5303869,3,B009AMALLM,This series of movies has probably met its end. There was little new and most of the movie was rehashed. The story was on the lame side.,1371859200,,136,4.074074074074074
5303870,3,B009AMALLM,"A new family begins experiencing strange happenings in their suburban home after taking in one of their son's playmates from across the street in PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4, the latest (and easily the worst) in the popular Horror franchise. The story has already strayed so far from the initial haunting that it is becoming a bore, especially when decreasing amounts of progress are made throughout each episode in revealing the secret occult origins behind the curse. The hand-held technique is no longer relevant, and it is used even more ineffectually when it comes to inciting any form of terror this time around, save for a single disturbing moment involving the Xbox Kinect in the living room. The ""surprise"" ending has been spoiled by casting Brady Allen as Robbie, who is far too evil from the very start. One can only hope that the series will either come to an end or take a dramatic shift in direction with the next film if they have any plans to continue.

5303871,1,B009AMALLM,"I looked forward to watching a Paranormal Activity movie, but this one thoroughly disappointed me. The movie rarely exhibited the ""shock"" or ""fear"" factor that one looks for in a horror movie.

**Spoiler Below: If you intend to watch it, I suggest you stop reading now...**

The movie began quite well, and kept me engaged. However, by the half-way mark, I found myself eagerly awaiting some action, or simply the conclusion. It became obvious that nothing was going to happen until the very end. Rather than taking the audience through a revealing story, culminating in a suspenseful conclusion, this movie provides the audience with almost nothing until the last 10-30 minutes.",1370995200,,679,5.108108108108108
5303872,3,B009AMALLM,"Paranormal Activity was a great film. One of my favorites for the horror genre, since it utilizes a style characterized as ""found footage"" shot by the characters in the film rather than a major studio, professional quality big budget horror flick. This was something I had not seen since the Blair Witch Project, and it's a style I love, since it actually gives a sense of not knowing what's going on, or what to expect, etc...
It tells of a couple living in Southern California, moving into a new house first thing in the film. They are Micah and Katie. Throughout the film they are haunted and terrorized by an unseen spirit/demon. In the end, only one of them ends up living, however possessed by the demon.

The sequel, Paranormal Activity 2, tells of the events leading up to those of the first flick. This time it shows what happens with Katie's sister and her family, further detailing that a woman can make a bargain with the devil, or a demon or something, for the price of the first born son. In this movie, they have a new-born baby boy named Hunter, which is apparently the first male born on Katie's side of the family since the 1930's.

Anyway, Paranormal Activity 3 shows what happened with Katie and her sister as children, which was briefly mentioned in the previous two flicks, however I'm mixed about it; When it was previously mentioned, it was described as they would be waken up and see a dark, shadowy figure in their bedroom at night, too terrified to move or do anything. However, this never happens in the third flick.

Paranormal Activity 2 marked a direction in the series that I haven't quite enjoyed as much as the first flick. Rather than unseen horrors (spirit or demon or what ever), it now goes to ""jump-out"" horror, or rather, things jumping out or lunging towards the camera, in a cheap attempt to make the viewer jump out of their skin. This does work, but it's not quite the same as the first as I mentioned, which I enjoyed a bit more since it was giving a lot more scares than the later flicks.

The second flick still had unseen horrors, and in the third they were minimal, but showing signs of being on the way out of the franchise.

Now we have Paranormal Activity 4. It continues the events from the first two flicks, 5 years after those events in fact, in which Katie and Hunter's whereabouts were still unknown. Now in Nevada, a family notice new neighbors move in across the street, a single mother and her young son.
Soon after the mother ends up having to go to the hospital, and her son is taken into care with the stories main family. And soon after that, strange things start to happen to the family, and a ghost-like figure starts appearing in the house under their Xbox's kinect, dark room effect or what ever.

This film, was alright. It wasn't quite as good as the first two, but in my opinion it was a little better than the third flick. I liked the new family in Nevada, and finally seeing what happened after the events of the first two flicks, with Katie apparently raising Hunter as her own since kidnapping him as a baby, and raising him under creepy, demonic influence. Although there seems to be a bit of confusion or discrepancy in who Hunter is. At one point in the flick, the main family's young son, Wyatt, turns out that he was adopted into the family, and somewhere halfway through the film, he starts to claim that he is hunter, and that his old family named him that etc....

So, did Katie give the baby up for adoption before the events of this film? I was believing that her son, who's name is Robbie in this flick, was Hunter all along, but now I don't know what's up, and nothing is ever revealed about who Hunter really is. Also interestingly, Robbie disappears later on in the film, where the main focus is now on Katie and Wyatt, and never again any mention of Robbie.

Of course returning from the third film is the invisible/imaginary friend (or demon probably) Toby, which Katie or her sister was seeing and talking to throughout the third film. He makes a couple of brief appearances in the family's living room in the dark, though visible with their Xbox's kinect feature, which puts a bunch of dots all over the room for detection. This was an interesting and creepy thing, but again gone is the ""unseen spirit/demon"" that I liked from the first two films. It now has a name as of the third film, and NOW partially visible in the fourth.
Besides all of this, the teenage daughter of the family and her best friend set up cameras throughout their house, which is unknown to the mother and father, as well as Wyatt, since weird things start happening at night since Robbie came to stay with them while his mother is in the hospital.

Anyway, as I've said, this one is an OK flick. Definitely not like the first one, but it does continue the story after the events of the first and second films in the franchise. I like the characters and location. And it is better than the third in my opinion.
I think my only gripe is that there's a scene missing from the home-DVD/Blu Ray releases. Of course an extended edition of the film is included in addition to the theatrical cut, and the Blu-Ray has even more footage not seen in any version of the flick.

But the scene I'm referring to, which I heard about after seeing the film, apparently takes place in Mexico with a little store, and someone says that it's only the beginning. I never saw this flick when it was in theaters, so I'm not sure if it was a theater-exclusive or not....
I read that this is supposed to be shown post-credits. THIS DOES NOT EVER APPEAR ON THE DVD OR BLU-RAY FOR PARANORMAL ACTIVITY 4!

Well, in closing, I give it 3 our of 5 stars. It's ok, but not the best.",1370908800,,5718,4.45697896749522
5303873,1,B009AMALLM,I've seen all the PA movies and this had absolutely nothing new to offer.  All the same scary effects each movie has done before and the story line was boring.  By far the worst of the series.,1370822400,6,192,4.162162162162162

Your movie ticket probably cost more than the nonexistent budget for this truly stupid home movie made by hacks.

We have a group of silly, moronic people. You can't like any of them. We have one movie set. An ordinary house.
Then we have zero scares. Nothing happens. We see too much of the young girl staring into the monitor. Then we have her really repulsive boyfriend hanging around. He does nothing but irritate as he munches and gobbles snacks throughout.
The first of this series was mild fun. There were no spectacular scares but it was something different--the minimalist horror film.
Now, it's like anybody can go to Wal-Mart, buy a cheap camera and just make a movie in your house. Get your neighbors and families to join in. You don't have to worry about wardrobe. Dress everybody in jeans and tee shirts and tennis shoes.

There was no thought put into this film whatsoever. It was predictable to the point of insult. It was as if they said ""we have your money sucker, so we are just going to phone this one in with a few jump scares and the same crap ending."" Same predictable ending and scare tactics, no development of the overall franchise arc, plot holes, and a stupid ending. They could have attempted to develop a heroine with the protagonist (even if it doesn't end well for her at least let these people take some sort of action), she was cute and likeable, but instead it was the same old sheet.

This movie however was just lame.  It kinda had things that the other films had it them, with the whole ""Night X,"" and then the date and it had a few creepy things happening.

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

But the jump scares, oh lord the jump scares.  A cat jumping into frame to scare me is not scary.  A girl flopping on her bed to scare me is not scary.  A mom opening the garage door and carrying in groceries is not scary.  A basketball bouncing down the stairs?  Just stupid.  And the thing with the kid riding around on his big wheel just reminded me I could be watching The Shining instead of this thing.

Plus an internet reviewer pointed something out to me that I didn't even think of.  Why was Katie taken to the hospital in the first place?  We never find out.  Also, when she came back she looked fine.  She didn't have a place on her arm where they could have put an IV in, she didn't look lethargic from anesthetics, she didn't have a hospital ID bracelet on, etc.  So what the heck was she doing at the hospital?  Some clarity would be nice.

Also, the movie is pretty much one big commercial for Apple products and the Xbox Kinect.  Because EVERYONE in this movie has an Apple laptop, or an iPhone, and we are shown people playing Kinect and those weird tracking dots from the Kinect are shown EVERY friggin' night!

Another thing that bothered me was the fact that these parents have to be the dumbest parents on the planet!  When clearly supernatural activity is shown to them, they completely ignore it.  It's almost like they stick their fingers in their ears, close their eyes and go, ""LA LA LA LA LA, I can't hear you!""  I mean you have to actively TRY in order to be this oblivious to things!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

I will admit that the extended version of the film is good and I really enjoyed the extra little tidbits that it had to show us.

Honestly it feels like they just made this film as an afterthought or an attempt to cash in on the franchise.  It doesn't really add anything to the Paranormal Activity storyline or give us anymore background on what's happening.  This film should never have been made and they should have just have left the series with three films.",1367625600,,2485,4.439024390243903

5 years after then events of the first and second films, we have a young girl named Alex who lives with her parents and her adopted brother Wyatt. Soon after the film opens a young boy named Robbie comes over and apparently his mother is in the hospital and he needs a place to stay as he has no other family to turn to. Well once Robbie gets to the house, odd things begin to happen, strange sounds, things seemingly paranormal shall we say, so Alex and her boyfriend set up computers with running video streaming to capture these hauntings.

What follows is the usual bumps in the night, shadows around Alex and others in the house and then once Robbie's mother is back (Katie from the first two flicks), things pick up. The scares get amped up and the deaths are pretty well done especially those in the last 20-30 minutes, the closing sequence may not make too much sense to those uninitiated to the series (how did all those people fit in the backyard of a standard sized house comes to mind) but if you've seen the first 3 films it makes a lot more sense.

I did enjoy this one, sure it doesn't really add a ton to the series in the end, but it actually was entertaining overall. Nothing grand but fun. **1/2 out of 4 stars.

5304004,3,B009AMALLM,"Cutesy interaction between a typical American family, along with the daughter's boyfriend, are the most interesting parts of this movie; the newest in a series of what is supposed to be edited together sets of private Youtube-ready videos that happen to catch strange ghostly happenings like books and chairs moving by themselves. And that's a conceptual problem because it's the paranormal activity itself, which revolve around the neighbor's creepy kid, that is supposed to be the star of the show. Instead, since it usually happens at night when nearly everyone is asleep or in the day when hardly anyone is around, it brings the plot to a comparatively dreary slowdown. For that reason, the first half of the movie, which I think also features more close-ups of the cute daughter and her sexy mother, is better than the second half.

Be aware there may be one vague spoiler reference toward the end.

I only watched Paranormal Activity 4 for the first time very recently, admittedly having put it off due in part to its poor reputation, but I was actually very surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I certainly understand how people may have grown bored with the series, and it's true, the ""edge of your seat"" factor isn't quite as intense as it once was, but it definitely has the same general feel as the rest of the films and blends in alongside them seamlessly. I thought the young female lead was likeable, and the addition of the strange neighbor boy was interesting. To me, the parents almost seemed TOO aloof, almost to the point of caricature, but I suppose they were written that way intentionally to emphasize the importance of the children's roles. My one complaint, if I had to make one, was that things ended up pretty much the same way as they did in part 3, and nothing really happened to make the arcing storyline move forward in any significant way. A lingering question or two may have been answered, but seriously, it's time to either explore the whole witch thing in-depth or get off the pot, lol. In and of itself though, I found it very entertaining, with a fair share of suspenseful - if not exactly scary - moments, and would surely recommend it to those who may still on the line.",1366675200,2,1662,4.413680781758957

The coven at the home at the end was the single creepiest moment in the entire 96 minute running time and that lasted a total of 1 second.

5304415,2,B009AMALLM,"(Vague Spoiler at the end of this review).

I've been intrigued with the phenonmenon of PARANORMAL ACTIVITY since the first one.  I love the idea that they made a neat little film on no budget using security cameras and managed to create some genuine chills.

That was the first one.  The second one wasn't bad.  The third one only had one or two moments that worked.

But the fourth one is starting to drag it all down.  Introducing new characters (neighbors to Katie and Hunter) didn't further the storyline at all.  Just as PA3 didn't move it forward (since it was set in the past before PA and PA2), PA4 didn't move anything forward and it was AFTER everything.

I know there will be PA5 come this Halloween, and why not?  They keep making money, at least enough to keep cranking them out.

But they're starting to creak and show signs of wear.  They'll need to do something different.  And, please, don't end another one with deadpan witches all converging on a camcorder.  You've done that.  Twice now.",1362268800,,1008,4.584269662921348
5304456,4,B009AMALLM,"I watched the other three first and then right before I was about to ""rent"" it through the site, I noticed what terrible reviews other people were giving. I almost did not bother when I read them-now I'm glad I rented it anyway. Are you people kidding me??
First of all, yes, it is FREAKING SCARY! No movies since ""The Ring"" have scared me like these, and the last installment is no different. Yes, there were a few 'in-jokes' etc., that the 4th movie could have gotten along without. Maybe. But I think our reaction to them, that of being slightly annoyed and rolling our eyes, is part of the whole experience.
Second of all, the reason these movies stay scary is because so much is totally unknown. We don't have a good handle on any ""facts"" in this story; not about the demon, not about the coven, not about the identities of each of the characters. In fact, all we get to go on is what the average person gets to go on from surveillance type video footage: just what is presented to the camera. And just because one person says something directly to the camera does not mean we should take it at face value. Obviously, there was a whole lot more to the story than Katie ever told us in the beginning of the first movie! We get just enough of the story to keep us coming back for more.
What I really want to see next is people fighting this thing, not just being victimized. Where is this demonologist mentioned in the first movie? Whatever happened to him?",1362268800,,1460,4.3713235294117645

Can't say it without ruining it (hah) for those yet to watch, but lets say there is little to ruin.  Why can't someone make a good SCARY ghost movie ?

But in this movie, the daughter finds a way to record everything all over the house, and the recordings fail as part of the plot.  SO WHAT ARE WE WATCHING!!??

5304560,5,B009AMALLM,"Every one of these movies has been cooler than the previous one. The first movie was extraordinarily tame by comparison to the ones which followed, and this fourth installment doesn't disappoint! In my opinion, using the X-Box 360 Kinect as a night vision ghost-visualizer was an extraordinarily cool and inventive idea.

In the second movie, the coolest moment was definitely when all of the pantry doors blew open at once. In the third movie, I loved the idea of attaching the camera to an oscillating fan (I mean, it was one of the coolest film ideas in movie history--you were always wondering what would happen once the camera oscillated back and forth), and in this movie, the ghosts get captured for the first time actually moving around by millions of tiny dots projected from a Microsoft Kinect console. Very modern, very cool. I think that's basically what makes all of this entire movie franchise essential cinema: how creative can you get using normal household junk to tape the ghosts. In the first movie, he sets up a camera. In the second, you've got household security monitors. In the third, they stick the camera on a fan, and in the fourth, again--the Kinect. These quirky film making techniques are what makes the movies so interesting and unbelievably watchable. Each movie puts ordinary suburban families in extraordinary circumstances, which is always the basis for a great story.

Yes, the story in the fourth movie jumps the shark a bit. Yes, it's sort of forced. But is 'the story' really why you watched any of the other movies? If you're looking for dramatic plot development, don't ever, EVER watch movies which are essentially stripped-down stories about scary things that go bump in the dark.

5304687,2,B009AMALLM,"I have seen all the Paranormal Activity movies, and this movie isn't as good as the previous movies at all. The movie never scared me a tiny bit. I had a crush on the teen girl the entire time, and sadly that's as far as I would come to liking this movie. She so cute!

What made the PA series was all the suspense and mystery. There not much of it in this one. Also, the demon, Toby, isn't as major part of the movie anymore. It seemed like he took a back seat, and letted others around him do more killings and it's pretty obvious.

I really shouldn't had watched this movie. It's funny too, how I didn't even know it was coming out in the theaters, until one day, I saw a poster for it, while I was there for a different movie. There wasn't any marketing done for this movie. It could be because it wasn't that good. I remember seeing Paranormal Activity 3 commercials everyday until it finally showed in the theaters. They kept on showing the commercials afterwards too. But, this? This one didn't have anything, but a poster in theaters. Not a single commercial for it! Wow.

Everyone that actually likes the PA series, should not see this one. They need to stay faraway from it because you will end up not liking the series anymore. Unless, you are just like me, and find the girl in the movie cute and just watch it for her alone. lol

5304692,2,B009AMALLM,"Every time I watch a ""Paranormal Activity"" movie, I walk away from it wondering why I put myself through the experience. I loathe them more than anything in cinematic history. I vainly hope that the next one couldn't be any worse than the one before it. However, they continue to disappoint me with ""Paranormal Activity 4.""

A family takes in a little boy when his mother is hospitalized. Unexplainable things begin happening shortly after his arrival. Is it all coincidence or did the child bring something supernatural into the house with him?

Writer Christopher Landon and directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman really have nothing new to add to what has come before in the ""Paranormal Activity"" franchise. Sure, we get some new ways to incorporate found footage into the movie like computer and iPhone cameras as well as Kinect sensors. The visuals and outcome are all the same, though. We get shadows, bumps, flickering lights, books falling, utensils floating, and a laundry list of other hoaxes and illusions too long to list.

I'm not going to say there aren't some genuinely scary moments. They're few and far between. Viewing ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is the equivalent of watching paint dry for 90 minutes with a bubble rising and popping every 10 minutes.

I have the formula for the films figured out as well. There's a low rumbling every time something ""scary"" is about to happen. Unfortunately, nothing every REALLY happens until the last 10 minutes. All we get before that are some loud bumps and a few elaborate but mostly elementary parlor tricks.

Creator Oren Peli does deserve a standing ovation for tricking so many people (not me; I see them for free, thankfully) into wasting money on these films year after year. ""Paranormal Activity 4"" alone brought in $140,706,358 off of a budget of $5 million. The entire series so far has cost $13,015,000 to make and grossed $714,788,650. Now that's just smart business!

Is there any way to really gauge the video or audio quality of ""Paranormal Activity 4?"" The movie is made up of video, computer camera, and night-vision footage of different qualities. We are given zero cinematography to praise or damn here. The 5.1 surround sound offers nothing to viewers except when there's a loud bang or low rumble from somewhere in the room. There's no musical score or real dialogue to speak of.

The ""Paranormal Activity 4: Unrated Edition"" features nine minutes of extra footage not seen in theaters. I can't even begin to imagine what the additional scenes could be. There's no way I was sitting through both versions to find out.

The only bonus material included on the Blu-ray version is a 28-minute featurette entitled ""The Recovered Files."" It's basically deleted scenes in the form of additional ""found footage."" Congratulations are in order to anyone who can sit through it.

Something else that eludes me is why they rate these movies R. There's nothing here that isn't seen in a PG-13 horror film or watered-down teen sex romp. All they'd have to do to make even more money at the box office is cut out three or four expletives. They'd then have a teen-friendly horror movie tailor-made for kiddies to enjoy.

I've said it before and I'll say it again. The ""Paranormal Activity"" films are made for people who don't regularly watch horror movies. Anyone who tells you any differently is lying. ""Paranormal Activity 4"" is another lackluster entry in a franchise which will continue to be a successful Halloween novelty until they stop making money.

If you've seen the previews you know this is a sequel to # 2 and follows Hunter and Katie.  From there the similarities to the other movies seem to stop.  The evil being is no longer the invisible force, but seems to be a shadow that moves around the room - a huge disappointment for me as I hate it when movies feel they need to reveal the creature/unknown being/demon.  Some of the suspense comes from not knowing what it is.  Second, throughout the movie I constantly wondered which little boy was Hunter.  Is it Robbie or is it Wyatt?  Once you think you have it figured out they change it again.  Which brings my next questions - if it isn't Robbie, who is Robbie?  Where did he come from?  If it's Wyatt, how did Hunter get adopted by another family?  Lastly, I feel the other three movies had a suspenseful build up, where the events increased in magnitude, to the climax of the movie - this one didn't seem to have that.  Just a series of small, random make you jump moments until - BANG!  People are dying!  All-in-all, the weakest of the four movies.

However, if you are moved by the psychological and the suspenseful, you'll probably have more appreciation for this. Throughout these movies you KNOW something is going to happen, something creepy...something's hiding in the background to shock you. In that way, PA4 was great. There are some really good jumps.
However, I was disappointed and almost confused by the plot points revealed toward the end. It didn't seem logical to me. Also, this movie seemed to bring out way more questions and didn't answer any. Great if there's going to be another one, not so great if this is the last installment.

Soon after, eerie things start happening in the household, some of which focus on the girl's younger brother Wyatt. As the bumps in the night become more pronounced, the mysteries surrounding Robbie's family and the house across the street grow to the point where the only thing for the teen girl to do is investigate herself.

I really enjoyed PA 1 and 2, 3 was okay and I was really disappointed with this one. It leaves more questions than answers and the ending happens so fast, you're wondering did that really happen?? As with the other movies, the beginning is slow and  the tension slowly, slowly builds. If there is a part 5, I hope it answers the questions brought by part 4. What was the connection with Wyatt? If Robbie was ""Hunter""? Why were they after Wyatt? I think they are starting to run out of ideas and if that's case, maybe it's time to retire the PA series.

5304977,2,B009AMALLM,"This isn't one of those reviews that exists just to pan the entire series and bemoan their continued existence. I found part one genuinely scary and while not as good, I still liked part two. But something started to go wrong with part 3. The whole retcon with this Toby character, mythology from the first two parts ignored, and the stereotypical Satanic coven were just the worst. Not to mention, the trailer for 3-which contained almost no footage from the actual movie-looked like a much better film.

With all of that, I was looking side-eyes at part 4, but I gave in and rented it anyway. For this entry, we are back in the present with a new family in Henderson, Nevada. We are reminded pointedly in the prologue that Katie and little Hunter from part 2 are still missing. There is a creepy little boy and his never seen mother next door. This mysterious mother gets sick and asks the new family to care for creepy kid while she's in the hospital. And things get weird.

If you've seen any of these films, you know the drill. Unexplained bumps in the night (and day) lead to levitating objects and eventually people. Long sequences of watching a person sleep or read or whatever are suddenly punctuated by jump scares. Even in part 3, these long sequences had occasional payoffs. While I wasn't a particular fan of that entry, there were a few scary scenes I rewound and watched again. Alas, I can't imagine anyone being frightened by this uninspired entry. Toby's actions this time are largely pointless and lame until the very end (and even then, I couldn't bring myself to be very interested.) Not to mention, the story just doesn't make much sense and it seems to contravene its own mythology. Which, given that we are at part 4 now, isn't that surprising, I guess. What exactly is ""Toby"" trying to accomplish at this point anyway?

And just like in part 3, hardly anything from the trailer was in the movie and once again, the trailer scenes look better. Although I doubt even the trailer scenes could save this.

What I did like were the actors, particularly the ones playing the teenage girl and her would-be boyfriend (Kathryn Newton and Matt Shively.) The child actor playing Robbie is convincingly creepy. Inevitably, they've announced a part 5 and a Latin spin-off. I strongly suggest we all read and heed the reviews before dropping more money into this demonic cash vortex.",1359676800,3,2393,4.690476190476191

PA 1 and PA 2 were occuring at approximately the same time, so it was a good reconciliation of the chain of events as we experienced them. PA 3 offered more of the backstory as to why these events were happening. PA 4 is tied to that backstory.

My biggest issue with PA 4 is that, where the first couple of movies offered a reasonable and believable cause for the remote cameras and coverage, this was more of a stretch. It involves the teenage daughter and her tech savvy boyfriend networking the electronics in the home to offer 24/7 coverage, plus carrying their laptops or camera everywhere with them to capture events outside of the house. It was ridiculous. Even in moments of extreme duress, they always had the camera recording.

I was very much looking forward to this, the forth movie in the series despite people's disappointment.

Well, there isn't much to say. I was completely let down. There is no story, no plot, no dialogue, no tension, and.....no scares. None at all. I could barely hold my eyes open. I looked to see how much longer of the movie was left and I was one hour and twelve minutes in and NOTHING had happened at all...except excruciating boredom. And I still had 24 minutes to go. The wonderful Katie Featherston looked like she had nothing to do, nothing to say in her few moments on screen. She seemed to be there for no reason except to kill a couple of people. I think Katie is probably tired of these movies, though they have made her fairly famous now. She is quite talented and very pretty.

So, the movie came to an end that by now didn't even matter. The ending had a couple of moments, but the endurance of waiting this brief couple of moments out was painful. And as I said, I truly love these movies. But I will not purchase this one to own. I'm only out the rental cost. Oh, the bonus featurette was just as bad. Just a repeat of a couple of scenes.

I understand part 5 is in the bag. I think they have run out of ideas and story lines. Perhaps it is time to call it a day on a decent film franchise.

Let me preface, I LOVED 1 and 2 and was extremely disappointed with PA3. With the exception of the addition of the Witch Coven/Cult I thought it was very lame.  Shortly into PA4 I realized just how important the back story of PA3 was to the continuation of the franchise.  While this one DOES take a little longer to get moving it is well worth the wait for the last Terrifying sequence.  (This coming from a guy that does NOT scare)  As you watch the ending it is a clear set-up for the physical manifestation of the Demon in PA5.  For all of you hating on this film for its slow build up and ""few scares"", i have this to say to you:  Grow Up or go back to your Action Junkie Films.

5305042,3,B009AMALLM,"I love the PA movies and have watched the previous 3 repeatedly so I wasted no time in seeing this one.  After watching it, I decided to do a review which is something I don't normally do even if I think a movie is great.  I gave the movie 3 stars not because it is a 3 star movie (its really not) but because I am hoping that the payoff will come in PA5. In a way one might consider this movie to be an hour and a half long prelude to the next film (I hope). PA4 itself is a slow moving movie with very few scares, a fact that is validated by the sheer number of reviews who have said the same thing.  The few scares there are are old hat, no new ground and the Xbox is really just annoying, an updated baby podwer. What this movie does have is a lot of exposition and even more unanswered questions.  It is the unanswered questions that makes this movie feel like the prelude to a much more interesting and intense movie.
(Spoliers ahead)...
If PA5 can successful answer questions like what happened to Robbie, how did Wyatt/Hunter end up in what seems to be a completely random family instead of with his Aunt Katie, was Alex's levitation an important future story plot or a cheap effect with no value to the movie, and several others, then PA4 might be redeemed as being an important (albeit slow and boring) installment to the franchise.  But we will have to wait until PA5 to know which way it will go.  If your a hugh PA fan then go ahead and rent the movie but whither your a hardcore fan or just a casual viewer, I would hold off on actually buying the movie until 5 comes out and we see if 4 pays off or if it marks the decline of this movie franchise.

Which could be good thing if the films that follow aren't like this.

The film is a sequel to the 2nd film and is set up in 2011. It follows a teen named Alex who starts to feel that something has invaded their house since the arrival of her new neighboors. This neighbors (no surprise) are Katie and a weird kid named Robbie.

This film felt like if the crew of this film just wanted to steal your money from you, it has no scares, you don't get to care for the characters (except for the boyfriend) and it doesn't even try to integrate something new for the franchise. The acting also was meh, the only good actors were the the boyfriend and the kids.

In fact, once the credits rolled I was one happy fan.

I will admit that this one wasn't as scary as the previous installments, the first movie being the scariest.  However, the creators of the film did a great job by using a certain specific story element of the previous movies and turning it into a completely new source of scare.  It wasn't a cheap kind of scare either, rather this time around the ""haunted"" characters of the latest chapter had more to contend with in this film than any of our previous haunted families.  This new element was both thrilling and terrifying at the same time.

Now, I do strongly recommend that those watching this movie see the previous three installments first (and in the order of their release).  You really need the context those movies give you in order to enjoy PA4 properly.  I can only imagine how bad this movie might seem without the overall mindset the previous installments provide.

Hopefully everyone was smart enough to watch till end credits to see extra footage which is said to be a set up for a latin spin-off and there is also pa5 on the way. So to all those giving this lower rating you're an idiot this is a good movie. In my opinion the best is between 2 and 3.

5305165,3,B009AMALLM,"I never got a chance to see this in the theater like the other 3, but saw it off iTunes which just came out for a pre-release and I actually thought the movie was ok.  I heard all the bad reviews so expected the worst but ended up being better then I thought it would be.  I still think 3 is the scariest and best along with the original which was very good as well.

Not sure if the actual movie or the DVD/Blu-Ray will have this but, the scariest scene from the trailer where she is on Facetime with her friend and that little boy Robby is standing outside in their driveway and she says what a creepy kid he is and then he looks up at her.  Then her room goes black and the alarm is going off saying front door open, side door open, back door open, and you see Katie (I think that was her name) standing in the room.  Like on the cover of the video.  That was all cut out.  So that was very disappointing.  Hopefully the Blu-Ray will have it.

But overall lots of scenes to make you jump.  The last 5 mins were freaky.  But the story overall didn't really make sense as you don't know who Robby even is and the whole Hunter thing etc.

Wish they had more things like PA3 had with the ghost sheet, kitchen stuff going on the ceiling, Toby pulling her hair, Bloody Mary scene, etc.  Not many cool stuff like that.",1358380800,,1314,4.0859375
5305186,2,B009AMALLM,"I, like so many others, am a huge fan of the PA franchise.  I love them all, have multiple copies of each release, watch them over and over, and watch anything that remotely resembles them.

However, PA4 is a stinker. (Warning... spoilers ahead!)

When the movie begins, we see Katie move in across the street from the focus family.  She has a little boy with her.  I assumed this was Hunter.

He introduces himself to the kid in the focus family, Wyatt, as Robbie.  Okay, I think, he's got a new name.  I can understand that since Katie and the boy are on the lam.  Logically they wouldn't be using their real names.

Then Katie goes into the hospital, and the kid comes to stay with the focus family.  No one questions that there could be child neglect/abuse going on with ""Robbie"" who, at the age of 6, is left on his own continually, wanders outside of the home at all hours of the night, never has a change of clothes, and acts, well, just downright weird.

Then we discover that it is actually Wyatt who was adopted and is Hunter.

Who, then, is Robbie???

He's the same age as Hunter, so we know he couldn't be Katie's, since Hunter was over a year old when he was kidnapped, and Katie had no children of her own.

Where did he come from?  Who does he belong to?  Why was Hunter removed from Katie's custody, and why wasn't Katie put away if she was caught kidnapping him?

Is Robbie really a child?  We know he's not Toby, because he speaks to Toby.  Does he belong to another member of the Cult?  Why does he always wear the same clothes?  What's the deal with the socks and sandals?  The fork?  The antique stuffed animal?

I have a sneaking suspicion the filmakers will use the formula they used for PA3 and go back in time for PA5 to reveal what happened in between 3 and 4, and give us the answer to these things.

At least I hope they do.  And I hope it's scary.  Because PA4 is NOT frightening in the least, and to me, was more aggravating and disappointing than entertaining.

That I actually gave another human being 15 cents to watch this cash-in on the PA series is shameful enough--truth be told, I gave $20.00.  And TAX.

Watching this was possibly the only time I have found myself hating children, and I know that's wrong, but I did.  I hated the kid on the screen who was supposed to be spooky because he lived down the street and didn't seem to have a Mommy, I hated the teen actresses who were genuinely bad at acting, I hated the pimping of the storyline from the excellent previous film, and hated myself, again, for paying the money to see this piece of s***

Basically the plot line is as follows: somehow, Katie (Katie Featherstone, who I always love to watch ""acting"") has moved down the block from another family who is also cursed with the ooga booga wealthy related demon curse.  She moves in with Hunter, who she snatched in the second film.  I'm assuming all of this, but it's all assumption, since the actual movie never makes it clear.  She cracks another person's neck.  Does that even count as a spoiler?

There we're things in the film I didn't understand mainly about Hunter and the ending......I guess the Hunter issue would be considered a plot hole and the ending would be considered.....stupid.

It feels like they went from flying high with PA3 to an engine stale resulting in a fiery crash an burn which is PA4.....for me it was that bad.

Hands down the biggest disappointment in the whole Paranormal Activity series.",1354838400,,1325,4.88
5305236,3,B009AMALLM,"While the 4th film in the PARANAORNAL ACTIVITY series hasn't quite yet jumped the shark, the producers should think strongly about moving the story significantly forward for 5 if they want to keep milking this cash cow.

Basically, 4 is a remake of 3 but with a different family and a Xbox Kinect - seriously, this movie is nearly infomercial for the wireless game system.  The found footage gimmick still works, but because we've seen this all before - three times before - the technique is starting to lose some of its power.  It doesn't help things when the character who sets up all the computers (it's computer cameras recording all the scares this time) has a harrowing near death experience that's all recorded - then doesn't watch the footage.

So what's the point?

Perhaps because this is the weakest of the 4 movies, the fact that we're never shown exactly who has found all this footage becomes a real letdown.  These films try their best to pretend that it's all real (no title sequence for instance), and that's all well and good - but seriously, 4 films in and we still don't know who's edited all this footage together and put titles on it?  This, plus barely moving the actual storyline ahead a wink, left me wondering what was the point of this film other then making a fast buck?  I mean, we get it - there's a demon/ghost about and a coven of witches that has summoned it - but what's their ultimate goal (other then daring the fools who record all the footage to put it on youtube); why are they risking possible exposure by killing a well to do family in an upscale neighborhood?  What's the grand plan?  PARANORMAL 4 gives us not a clue.

Ironic as the poster claims that ""All the activity has led to this.""

It's the repetitive nature of this film and near total lack of new story that kills any real power to scare.  In fact all most all the scares are of the cheap shock variety, not close to the hair raising terror the other 3 movies possessed.  Why not have the new victims be poor or black or English?  Anything else other then yet another yuppie white family living in a giant mansion with a huge staircase in the Southwest.  While 5 promises a change of pace, it comes one movie too late.

5305238,2,B009AMALLM,"Since its inception in 2007, the Paranormal Activity series has led the pack of

suspenseful horror films. Paranormal Activity, the first installation of the series, was a

huge success and considered one of the scariest movies to date. This brought on a huge

surge of knock offs and wanna-bes. However, the Paranormal Activity series continued to

distinguish its self from the crowd, until now.

I personally have been a huge fan of the Paranormal Activity series, and have even

been satisfied by some of the spin offs that spawned from it. However, Paranormal Activity

4 has thoroughly disappointed me. As with many other genres, there are only so many

different types of stories to make a film from. This is certainly true for supernatural horror

films. Paranormal Activity 4 marks the end of new ideas in this genre.

The film is a sequel to the second movie of the series and picks up with seemingly all

new characters. The movie focuses around Alex (Kathryn Newton), her boyfriend Ben

(Matt Shively) and Alex's little brother Wyatt. The movie starts to take the expected turn

when Alex's family lets the strange child from across the street stay at their house for a few

days. From here on the plot starts unfolding and strange things start happening around the

house as Robbie and Wyatt start talking to an imaginary friend. Of course, Alex's parents

try to explain everything with logic and child's play.

As in the other three movies of the series, stationary cameras, equipped with night

vision, are mounted around the house to catch any evidence of unexplained happenings.

Luxon
The director, Henry Joost, does a good job in wowing the viewers with a cool effect on one

of the stationary cameras. Ben shows Alex and the boys a cool trick using the Xbox Kinect

and the infrared night vision. The Xbox device emits thousands of little infrared dots to

capture motion, and the night vision camera sees all these dots making for a very cool high

tech effect. This effect allows for the imaginary friend to be seen in a blurry human-like

figure of dots.

Although, the movie has the added Kinect effect, they dropped a seemingly

insignificant part of the stationary camera aspect that made the first three movies great. In

the other three films, while nothing spooky was going on in the footage from the cameras

was fast-forwarded, as shown by a time stamp. When something was about to happen,

it would play at a normal speed, indicating you needed to pay close attention. This little

detail was not present in the fourth movie as a result a feeling of suspense and hyper focus

was lost. The movie further deviated from its predecessors with less actual paranormal

activity and too much focus on Robbie and Wyatt talking to a wall. While disturbing and

unsettling it doesn't have a scare factor that the other movies had.

Paranormal Activity 4 does have some good jump frights though. One of the first

is when Alex wanders into Robbie's house to find Wyatt. Alex is startled as Robbie's

mother, Katie (Katie Featherston) appears behind her out of nowhere. Fans of the series

recognize Katie as the star of the first movie, with significant appearances in the other two

as well. Her arrival in the fourth movie was cleverly done and made the light bulb go off in

viewer's heads. This loose connection between movies is a strong suit of the series and is

maintained in the number four. As the story unfolds, it allows for all the pieces to be put

together and the series takes shape as a whole.

Luxon
Shortly after Katie's appearance, the movie starts speeding up; I would say too

fast. Knifes are thrown by invisible forces, chandeliers break, chairs move around, toys

malfunction. Alex becomes extremely concerned and fears for her life. Katie and Robbie

show strange interest in Wyatt and even start to call him by a different name. By the time,

Alex and her parents catch on things have escalated beyond their control.

The final scenes and ending seem rather quick and abrupt but still yield many

screams from the crowd. The ending has little or no ties to the rest of the story that I could

tell. As the final scene faded to black and the credits rolled, my viewing partner both had

the feeling of ""that's it?"" The build up and action all went by so quickly you feel like there

should be something left to watch.

I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with high hopes of a decent ending to

the story. This movie will still get you to jump and scream, but doesn't have you on the

edge of your seat for 90 minutes like the other three. This movie struck disappointment in

me, but it is still much better than most of the supernatural movies out today. My advice:

wait for it to come to Netflix.",1354492800,,4754,4.688861985472155
5305239,2,B009AMALLM,"Alrighty. I am a fan of the paranormal movies. I am. I like the idea they had and they tried to run with it. Can't do that anymore. I will go in order of the time line of them. So starting with number 3. I liked it. Really liked it. I liked the dust falling on Tobi and the crazy girl cult and how they made it a prequel. Same formula they had in here they had in all of them though.

Number 1. I will say I loved number 1. It reintroduced what a horror movie actually is. The horror movies today are more gore factor thus I have dubbed them Gorror movies. Dont care for those anymore. Why grosse me out when I want a thrill from a good scare. But thats just me. Anywho, this movie pretty much has the same formula that halloween had. Nothing happens for a long time until the end. Tid bits happen here and there but pretty much nothing happens until the end. Just like in Halloween. However in todays movies we don't often like that formula as much. But for the start of a film series, this was a delight. Original in it's own way with the cool parlor tricks and 15,000 dollar budget and I have no choice but to give the original Director props but it still has the exact same formula as halloween.

Number 2 was a prequel with like 2 scenes of a sequal to number 1. This had the same formula as well but with Katie's Sister and her family. Didnt matter who it was but it was the same formula that started to bore me. Oh, but get this. The entire family dies and Katie takes hunter. I get it. The demon has come back because of the grandma who made a deal with it for the first male in the family. Okay. Cool. So Katie-Tobi demon has Hunter the first born male in a generation or whatever....Now for the twist.

Number 4. Before I get to the twist, again it was the same formula but a different family. Yawn. Lets throw in alittle confusion now. Hunter was put up for adoption to get kidnapped by katie again who had another demon child try  and succeed in getting him possessed or join the Girly cult demon worshippers. I get that number 3 was good by adding the cult. That was kinda creepy and a good addition. But now it was blown up into a whole army of demon possessed girl cult people...Sorry. I was still trying to figure out why Katie or tobi or whatever would still put up Hunter for adoption just to kidnap them again later. It doesnt make sense.

So in conclusion these movies for me are 2/4 for the 4 movies. I liked 2 of them. But didn't like the other 2. I still think it would have been better if they had Hunter possessed by Tobi recruit from another family to satisfy its hunger for the babies or girls or whatever crazy demon pimp it is. Not going to buy this one sadly. Even if katie went beast mode on me. Not worth it in my opinion.",1354320000,4,2754,4.121042830540037

5305245,2,B009AMALLM,"So where did Katie and Hunter go? Instead of directly following their story, ""Paranormal Activity 4"" shifts the viewpoint, centering on an ordinary family the Nelsons happily living in Henderson, Nevada. They start experiencing weird things after someone moved into a house across the street. This is not a bad idea for a sequel, and there are certainly a few scares, but all in all the fourth entry of ""Paranormal Activity"" is more silly than scary.

As you know, everything is shot in a ""found footage"" style, trademark of this franchise. In ""Paranormal Activity 4,"" a high school girl Alex Nelson (Kathryn Newton) and her friend Ben (Matt Shively) record strange occurrences in the house, using laptop computers. They also frequently chat via webcam. The latest entry's story is set in 2011.

They may employ new video recording devices, but it seems the filmmakers have used up ideas to scare the viewers. I think most of us are now accustomed to sudden loud noises and things popping out. It is the easiest way to scare people, and it works, well, maybe for the first twenty minutes. Then it gets repetitious and predictable, especially when the film has virtually no story to tell.

Strangely, neither Alex nor Ben is really interested in checking the recorded images that would show (and do show to us) what is going on in the house. OK, maybe files did not open (so conveniently), but even so, there are still so many creepy events that happen to the unsuspecting characters. If ""that thing"" should fall from above right in front of me in my house, I would immediately run away and move out.

But they don't. OK, I know, this is a film, not reality. Sadly, the film's visual and narrative styles that once claimed to be real have become tiresome and contrived. With the franchise's initial novelty wearing out, ""Paranormal Activity"" has run its course.",1352592000,5,1860,4.803125
5305266,1,B009AMALLM,"From the success of the first paranormal activity we got suspense and mystery behind the activity taking place. With this fourth entry in the franchise the mystery and suspense has become non-existent. The question we have to ask ourselves is where is this going? And why? Nothing really happens in this installment as the majority of the time you see people recording things for some unknown reason; until activity starts happening which is like 30 minutes into it. The other element is the technology being used to record the events. Its not that laptops are a bad idea to record events but when it seems like a dozen laptops are being used around the house instead of cameras makes it ridiculous. In any event, the weak part of this movie is the script. More jump scares are being utilized rather than true suspense; well with an exception of the last ten minutes of the movie. It is clear that the studio is looking for a cash grab and will continue to dish out sequels until diminishing returns kicks in. In contrast, the Saw movies may have blown its wad after the third installment, but what made the franchise so successful was not only the traps but the story.  There was progression with the Saw movies in terms of story; rather Paranormal Activity jumps in timeline to the event where there is no clear direction to where the story is headed. The Saw movies had fun messing with the timelines (Saw 3,4, and 5), but Paranormal acts as stand-alone films with a strand of story from the first movie. The big problem is keeping the viewer engaged with whats going on in the movie; however, the majority of the run-times have had little to nothing going on. From the first movie everything was fresh and a mystery, but with sub-sequent installments the audience is familiar with what to expect and nothing has changed in terms of directing. Paranormal Activity 4 is clearly the weakest of the series, which is unfortunate because some the performances from the actors are descent. With the green-light of Paranormal Activity 5 in October 2013 and a latino-spinoff in the Spring, only one can hope that there is a clear direction as to where this is all going. In my opinion, nowhere.",1352592000,2,2189,4.685714285714286
5305267,2,B009AMALLM,"Unless you have the IQ of a turnip, you already know this series is fake. However, the producers in their wisdom have decided if they can cut off more heads with bad camera angles and implore worse sound they might still convince us of the reality of this film. If you go on U-Tube or watch the amateur submissions to some America's video TV show, you will see that we are better photographers than this series makes us out to be.

In the beginning, Hunter is kidnapped as an infant. We then jump to 5 years later. The film starts out mostly of a young male filming a teen female (Kathryn Newton). She has a younger brother Wyatt (Aiden Lovekamp). When Robbie (Brady Allen)the creepy young boy next door shows up with his imaginary friend weird things begin to happen. Alex, our teen girl allows the young man (Matt Shively) to set up cameras around the house to film the weird things that are going on and to cut off everyone's head. While weird things were caught on camera, they never went back to view the films which was the whole purpose of setting up the cameras in the first place.

Special effects, and by by ""special"" I mean ride the short bus special, included the chandelier moving, doors opening, chairs moving, covers coming off, and a bad levitation scene. No pool crawler getting out of the pool by itself.

This was by far the least of the series. If you were a big fan of the other three, you might find enjoyment in this one as this is upgraded to color. These films are cheap to make and pay for themselves in the opening weekend. Don't expect the franchise to go away anytime soon. Kathryn Newton did a good job in spite of the script and horrible camera shooting.

5305268,2,B009AMALLM,"A big fan of this series (my name even gets a fan credit in #1!), I thought the trailer for PA4 was awful. And the ""viral campaign"" never took off like it did for #2 and #3. It was as if even those involved simply weren't very committed/interested in the film they were making.

The reviews were ALL tepid--even those that sort of praised it--and word of mouth was dismal. The ""actual people watching the film"" TV ad was so over-the-top, it became a joke.

And then the film itself was a mess. Why have the wink-wink ""in jokes"" of the kid riding the bike like THE SHINING? It takes us ""out"" of the movie we're watching...and ads zero to the film. Same with the first
fake"" drag scene of the girl. Again, why remind us that we're watching a movie, why take us out of the experience?

And NOTHING happens for so long into this movie, it's just people talking and talking and talking. The few little scares are already shown in the trailer, which they have done before...but those are the ONLY scares! So we are not surprised.

And it's clear that the writers/directors had no real ideas of what Toby was to do this time. In other words, WHY does he levitate the girl? If the goal is to kill everyone, that just do it. The levitation scene is simply to impress US, the viewers. But we've seen that before, in a dozen films...and in the trailer! So there is no shock or surprise. And why bounce the ball down the stairs? And why is there scene after scene in the dark with the xBox? Toby is ""better"" than moving some dots around but they feature that xBox feature into the ground.

Finally, the ending (no spoiler, if you've seen PA3)...is the SAME ending as PA3. We learn nothing. In fact, you can remove PA4 and you've learned NOTHING. When PA5 comes out, hopefully the filmmakers have learned from the dismal box office, word of mouth and reviews for PA4 to PUT THE SCARES BACK IN. And have a REASON for the film.

All the above being said, I WILL buy PA4 and here's why: I wasn't that impressed with PA3 in the theater but the extra footage--not much, just a few scenes of Toby messing with the girls more--made for a MUCH more ""sinister"" film. Not sure why they were cut from the film, but they really add to PA3. Same with PA2--and maybe these movies are just better seen at home.

So, here's hoping that PA5 will really deliver. They know what a mess PA4 was, so let's hope they have learned their lessons.",1351209600,80,2409,4.351893095768374

If horror franchise history 101 has taught me one thing, it's that usually the franchises start getting long in the tooth after the third movie. The only franchise I've seen an exception with that was the Friday the 13th series, where part IV was where the series became watchable. And be it no surprise that something like Paranormal Activity is something that manages to rake in money with every installment every year. The series before it that held the same claim to fame was the Saw franchise. And what do both of these have in common? Both peaked at the third movie. Sadly, Paranormal Activity is quickly becoming the new Saw franchise, something I've feared since before the second movie came out.

Yet, in a way, it makes more sense to drag the Paranormal franchise out than the Saw franchise. With Saw, Jigsaw died in the third movie, and we got a bunch of ridiculous whodunits, all amounting to some silly twist that read like a fanfic, with Dr. Gordon filling in for Jigsaw. Here, there hasn't been any silly twists, since the series has made things more apparent with every movie about the origin of the demon, and even the idea of a satanic cult was interesting. I liked it when they brought it up in the third movie. Problem is, we're on the fourth movie in the series now and really nothing has been done with it. I mean, yes, I could complain that the movie has repeated the same formula over and over again, but more on that later.

Having broken out of the sequel with a prequel formula, Paranormal 4 starts with a scene near the end of the second movie, where Katie and Hunter are sitting with Kristi by the side of the backyard pool, and she gives him a bracelet. Then a series of obligatory title cards, in the same typewriter font as the previous movies, explain what has happened so far. Right, as if we, the people who saw every movie in the series, needs to be explained to why and what happened. Then, we get the ending of the second movie, with Katie killing Kristi, running off with Hunter, and maybe a 2 second shot that's completely new, where Katie walks out of the house with Hunter, and that same title card explaining how their whereabouts remain unknown. Already we're 3 minutes into the movie and we haven't got any new material... is the series really this out of ideas?

Anyways. We go to November 2011, in Henderson, Nevada. We're focused on a new family, whose last name for some reason remains unknown. The mom and dad haven't talked to each other a lot lately, and are on the verge of divorce. The daughter is a very beautiful and happy 15 year old with a cool boyfriend, who may be the only interesting character in this movie. Furthermore, they have an adopted 6-year-old named Wyatt, who's parents remain unknown. They've been receiving mysterious visits from a creepy kid named Robbie, including an unwelcome visit in the family treehouse, and when an accident happens with his mom, he is forced to stay three days at their house. The boyfriend of Alex, the daughter, points out that the XBOX Kinect projects dots that are only visible on night vision video cams, that track movement. This was a gimmick I was hoping would work, kinda like the oscillating fan in the third movie, but sadly, it only served useful maybe once.

And so in the first night of his staying there, Alex hears a noise downstairs at 3 AM, and finds Robbie standing creepily in front of the Kinect. Some mysterious ghost, who runs behind him and shakes the house, appears, and this compels the boyfriend, who is tech savvy, to set up the family's laptops in places around the house, and leave them open, as apparently they can record video even when they're turned off. This was something else I was hoping would do some good, but really, it didn't.

So, really nothing happens for this time period, but for a few things. One unexpected (but not really scary) moment is when a chandelier mysteriously drops from the ceiling, and Alex, holding the camera, pans the camera up to find Robbie sitting there, watching and staring in silence. Another moment is when a knife manages to disappear in one scene, and then, in another scene, falls down in front of the camera, startling the dad in the family. And there's Katie's appearances, which are good fun and Featherston, as expected, turns in a great performance as Ktie who is now completely possessed by the demon. There's one good jump scare in the scene at the end, where Alex finds a demonic coven, then turns to find Demonic Katie launching for her. Mind you, we had to sit through 80 minutes of same old same old to get to that part, which is never a good sign.

By this point, it should become blazingly obvious what happens, even if you haven't seen the first four movies. Which is the problem- this movie is one big, long prologue into the fifth movie. Nothing is done to advance the films plot, and by that, I mean NOTHING. Even Katie's appearances and the twist ending involving Wyatt, do absolutely nothing to further the movie's plot.

So maybe the movie really isn't as bad as I may make it sound. It's an OKAY film, if you're a die-hard fan if the series. I'll admit, I have seen worse. But since we've gotten four movies into the franchise, two being done by Henry Joost and Ariel Schumann, who both did a great job with the third movie (many because they had some documentary experience with fan favourite ""Catfish"", which got lots of praise from critics and audience alike), and using the same formula, Oren Peli seems to not know where he's going with this series. Hell, the formula from the third movie is repeated here. And believe me, it's an even more stale version of the ending from Paranormal 3. In fact, I kid you not, as soon as the credits came up, the audience booed at the film. That's a definite clue that the series has nowhere to go but forward, with the same formula under its belt, but even less scares than the original. Furthermore, the series has even sunk to the level of using jump scares and CG. the low budget first movie had one jump scare and no CG, 2 and 3 had maybe 2 or 3 with a small dash of CG. CG is everywhere in this movie and it's unintentionally hilarious (does Tobey REALLY look like an alien?)

From an acting standpoint, the film isn't bad per se. Katie Featherston is predictably great, and the boyfriend is great too. Reading his IMDb bio, I noticed that he's been in theatre since the fourth grade, just like me. So its definitely not a surprise he can act. From an aesthetic standpoint is where the movie fails. I saw the movie in IMAX, and it's baffling why it even got an IMAX release. Alright, the sound was great but more on that later. The movie's shots can be divided into two categories: fuzzy, webcam style shots and shots of Alex's face. And Alex is a pretty girl and all, but we don't get enough of her parents either, which is a rarity for the franchise. From the third movie, Dennis was a fun character and the mother was funny, though bitchy. And the mother and father here uninteresting because WE SEE SO LITTLE OF THEM.

It's worth a note that Robbie isn't all that scary either. Kids get a bad rap In horror movies nowadays and it's not hard to figure out why. Robbie is kinda creepy in his first appearance in the tree house, but after that he isn't creepy at all. He confuses creepy stares with bored droning facial expressions, and seems like a little kid who is crabby because he can't get that toy he wants.

So, finally, a word to Oren Peli. Stop this madness now! LET THIS THING DIE HERE. And perhaps fire the screenwriter, Christopher Landon, with it. Or at least find someone who can do something with Paranormal 5, since it hasn't even been two days since the movie came out and already you have announced the fifth movie. I'm sure super special edition 4 disc directors cut blu-ray release with a holographic slipcase cover and a ticket to Paranormal Activity 5 will have all the special deleted scenes and alternate endings, but at this point, I don't even care anymore. This movie is by no means a classic, and while I may have seen worse, it's only a matter of time before this franchise devolved even further into Saw-itude.",1351036800,5,8226,4.521505376344086
5305270,5,B009AMALLM,"I think that the Paranormal Activity franchise keeps getting better with each release. My favorites are still #1 and #2, but what I like with these releases is the new ways the creative cast keep using the video camera in different ways. Instead of walking around with a camcorder, they used security footage in #2, older style VHS camcorders on an oscillating fan in #3, and now, SKYPE and video chatting footage in #4. The central source for the activity is still with the demon and Katie, but now the story has evolved to how each new cast is going to figure out how to put an end to the evil that has manifested itself over the history of this family. I look forward to each new film to see what is going to be presented next. I still believe that this franchise has much more to deliver.",1350864000,9,792,4.358108108108108
5305271,2,B009AMALLM,"...but this new film doesn't hold a candle to those movies.

I remember watching the first Paranormal Activity back in 2009 in a crowded theater in San Antonio. Up until that time I'd never truly been scared by a movie before, except for with The Exorcist and even that wasn't all that scary. Paranormal Activity was the first movie to truly frighten me and cause me to lose sleep. The second film was much the same except much, much scarier. The third film, although it went in a different direction then the first, managed to breathe new life into the franchise and give us some unique and innovative techniques in order to deliver scares in a different manner than its predecessors.

With the fourth installment of what is otherwise a great horror franchise the creators seem to have taken all the criticism from the first three movies to heart, specifically that there isn't enough action, it's too slow, and nothing really happens until the end. To compensate for all the haters, they decide for this film to go all in from the very beginning. No longer are we straining our eyes for multiple nights simply to see a door movie a LITTLE bit, or a shadow cross over the camera lens, or for the pool robot to climb out of the pool inexplicably. The agonizingly slow build up and extreme tension that made the first three films so great (for those of us that actually enjoyed them, that is) is replaced with a more upbeat, fast pace scare more reminiscent of mainstream horror films then its independent roots. Even for its two hour running time (approximately) the film seems rushed as it tries to cram in as many creepy scares as possible, all at the expense (in my opinion) of pacing and tension. I thought the first and second movie especially were extremely good for the very fact that they gave us so little to work with; a bump in the night, a squeaky door, a chandelier swaying ever so slightly or a pan falling from its rack. I'm not going to give away the scares in this movie, but I will say they aren't nearly as subtle as before.

Another thing that somewhat lessened the scares in this movie was that it relied a lot on the people in the film to deliver the scares and not the ""entity"" from the first three. Sure, it makes its appearances and does its usual ""activities"" but to a much greater degree than in the first three it uses mere mortals to do its dirty work. I don't know about you, but no matter how scary you make someone's face look, it's not NEARLY as scary as some paranormal entity. That's not to say that ""Toby"" doesn't do his share, just to say that he goes to the bench way too often instead of stealing the show for himself. At the same time there was very little innovation with this film. The first movie took the POV angle and ran with it, the second film expanded it with more cameras, and the third gave us that great rotating camera work. Besides a nifty little trick with an Xbox Kinect there isn't really any innovation to speak of here. It's pretty much the second movie with computer camera's taking the place of security camera's, and a Kinect. Nothing special, nothing new, and nothing worth speaking of.

This far into the franchise one would normally expect the series to be wrapped up by now, or at least to have some of the major questions answered. Unfortunately this film doesn't wrap up anything, instead it merely sets the stage for ANOTHER movie that will no doubt be coming out sometime next year. More questions (and really baffling ones at that) are raised by this movie then answered. Don't expect to find out what this coven is up to, what kind of deal they made, WHY exactly this entity wants Hunter and what it intends to do with him, or anything. Practically nothing is explained while more and more mystery is piled on us in order to make us watch the next movie. I don't want to be spoon fed answers like horror movies are want to do, but a little clarification would be nice. Just a LITTLE bit, no?

On the plus side, the last ten to fifteen minutes of the movie are, as usual, very scary. Not AS scary as the finals for one, two, or three, but still scary. The characters aren't really all that great except for the two leads (Ben and Alex) were decently acted. The parents were nobodies throughout the entire movie, barely putting in any face time and only serving as cannon fodder for the entity and his minions. They seemed to merely fill in roles instead of playing actual characters. They might as well have been props.

In conclusion I must say that this movie was a major letdown. I loved the first three films, with the second being my favorite, but the series has lost steam. If you're a Paranormal fan like myself then its worth a watch when it comes out on video, but definitely not anything worth speaking of. Sorry guys, it just wasn't that great.

Replay value; low.",1350777600,,4846,4.475113122171946
5305272,1,B009AMALLM,"They dropped the ball on this one and left a bad taste in my mouth marking, perhaps, an end to this otherwise well-done franchise.  Not scary.  Not creepy.  Not good.

I loved Paranormal Activity (2008), perhaps enjoyed Paranormal Activity 2 (2010) even more, and, despite being my least favorite, I even liked Paranormal Activity 3 (2011).  These three movies set the same stage with the same types of slow-building creepy scares while obscurely adding detail to the origin of their poltergeist.

This fourth installment has the same directors as Paranormal Activity 3 (2011), but they seemed to have strayed from the formula that worked so well in the previous films.  For example, parts one to three open by introducing us to young couples and families that are likable, and they did this well so that we viewers would actually give a damn when bad things start happening to these characters.  They're always some variant of an American family portrait and it's easy for us to identify with them.  Part four begins by introducing us to Alex, a young teen, and her sort of annoying boyfriend.  Contrary to the prequels she is just handed to us and no effort is made to show her finer qualities or her relationship with her parents.  In fact, the parents are more implied than presented until later in the movie, when they become more integral to the story.  We don't even get the notion that the parents have a happy marriage as our victems did in Poltergeist or the earlier Paranormal Activity films.  As a result, we don't know much about them and feel indifferent about their haunting.

Alex is meant to be a protagonist much as the daughter was in Paranormal Activity 2.  She does the things a protagonist does, but I never bought it.  Her character was ineffective.  As the story progresses and her parents begin to experience the haunting, we are just then starting to learn about them.  Oh, and the franchise story seems to be getting obscured rather than developed in this fourth film which was, for lack of a better word, annoying.

Alex's family takes in their neighbor's (Katie Featherson; Paranormal Activity, Paranormal Activity 2, Paranormal Activity 3) young son Robbie after she goes to the hospital sick.  After taking in this quirky child and his invisible friend, some strange things start happening.  We don't know what Katie was doing between her disappearance (at the end of Paranormal Activity 2) and this movie.  She's just dropped in our lap and we have to just deal with it.  Robbie paints a color-by-numbers witchcraft symbol on Wyatt (Alex's little brother) which evidently indicates that he is to be possessed during some ritual.  Alluding to the end of part 3, this concept is hardly followed up.  Toby, Robbie's invisible friend-poltergeist, is a mixed bag in this film.  The first two films seemed more like ""house"" movies in which ""things were simply happening to people"" as a result of ""something.""  Part three presented a poltergeist, a specific entity, which was actively ""doing things to people.""  In part four, we get a little of both, demonstrative of poor writing and rendering our ghost less credible.  The ""things"" that happen to Alex's family are less frequent, less scary and less interesting by far than in the other films.

For whatever reason, the directors also used fewer subtle ""did you see that?"" moments when something moves or changes and if you blink you'd miss it.  Those moments were exciting in the earlier films.  All we get in this one is two moving objects, a broken chandelier and some swaying doors.  This movie actually felt boring compared to the rest of this engaging franchise.  Even the meant-to-be-shocking ending was a big ho-hum disappointment.

Even if you're a fan of the franchise, you should probably just skip this.",1350777600,3,3792,4.881064162754304
5305273,2,B009AMALLM,"Paranormal Activity has become the ""Police Academy"" of horror films, with a sequel each year targeted at a particular type of audience, with a similar plot and familiar characters each time out. This year, the pickings are very slim, as this is by far the worst film of the four. Scares are few and far between, the acting is terrible, and the film is ALMOST IDENTICAL to Paranormal Activity 2, with the same exact ending as Paranormal 3.

With a budget this big and a devoted audience, it is an insult to the integrity and to the intelligence of the loyal fans to put out a lackluster film such as this. They have obviously run out of ideas and are already rehashing the same scenes over and over again. Unless you are a huge fan of the franchise, don't seethis film. Not only are the first three better, but they are almost identical.",1350691200,41,836,4.4640522875816995
5305274,3,B009AMALLM,"I'm a fan of this series and I have to say I liked Paranormal Activity 4. It's not one of the strongest entries in the series but, I still had spooky fun with it and the last act delivered the goods. I think there still is enough of what fans like about this series to entertain but, next entry better start cranking things up and taking risks. This entry opens up in 2011. A family in Nevada gets new neighbors across the street. A strange boy named Robbie (Brady Allen) and his single mom, Katie (Katie Featherston). When his mom is suddenly taken to the hospital, the family takes creepy Robbie in. Once there, teen Alex (Kathryn Newton) starts to notice strange occurrences as Robbie befriends her little brother, Wyatt (Aiden Lovecamp) and so she and boyfriend, Ben (Matt Shively) set up cameras and set the household laptops to record to get to the bottom of things that are going bump in the night...and day, too. Soon Alex begins to believe Robbie is not the only new occupant in the house. The first act seems to be a bit choppy and there are a few odd edits throughout and it is in act 1 in which the film has it's strongest feeling of dj vu but, things start to pick up steam during the middle act and the movie really starts to click and become more it's own thing. Then the third act locks in and delivers the goods up to and including the spine-chilling climax. Sure, along the way there are some familiar elements but, you wouldn't remove Jason's hockey mask would you? There were enough new wrinkles in my book to keep things going, as well as, some subtle hints as to where the mythos might be headed. Not to mention a surprising reveal, too. The cast are all fine. The parents get the least screen time and character development but, the teens are likable, Wyatt is sweet and Robbie is very creepy. Series regular Katie Featherston gets a bigger role then early screenings suggested and without spoiling things, I liked how the character was used and Katie Featherston did a good job with her role. All in all there is some definite 'been there done that' but, I think fans will enjoy this entry enough to want more and that's what the filmmakers will have to deliver next time to keep this series going. It's time to really take some chances and give us something to really bite our nails over. Paranormal Activity 4 is a nice snack to hold us over till then but, it's time for Katie and company to give us a full meal of fright and new surprises.",1350604800,3,2466,4.421978021978022
5305275,5,B009AMALLM,"I was a fan of the first Paranormal Activity 1, back in 2001, mainly because I'm an independent thinker who enjoys seeing movies not because everyone says to see them due to some buzz. I hated Paranormal Activity 2, mainly because I hate sequels, which is exactly why I then immediately loved Paranormal Activity 3. I was hoping for an awesomer time with this gem, Paranormal Activity 4, and I totally was not disappointed at all!

Paranormal Activity 4 sees the return of one Katie, who had been absent since 3. Her reappearance, midway through 4 and very abruptly, is basically explained by a reference to her making a wrong turn on the freeway and then getting lost in some ""black"" neighborhood or something like that. Now I'm sure no racism at all was planned--hold on a second, I just have to go to the bathroom right now because I had too much Mountain Dew to drink--but I still found this explanation about as believable as Barack Hussein Obama claiming that a YouTube video was the reason behind American ambassador Chris Stevens' murder!

I won't give the ending away, yet let's just say that the Dracula fellow from Bram Stoker's Dracula and also even the stupid-looking Asian girl from the Grudge make a brief cameo. Needless to say, I was not expecting to see this, but since I love highly original and totally unpredictable films, I give Paranormal Activity 4 two middle fingers up...way up!",1350604800,4,1404,4.726530612244898
