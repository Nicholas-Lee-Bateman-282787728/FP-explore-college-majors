8070443,5,B0009YFZES,"I love Patricia McConnell, PhD., who hosts this 45-minute video. She is a well-respected Certified Applied Animal Behaviorist, who has written many books to help people better understand their relationships with their dogs. In this video, Dr. McConnell incorporates her knowledge of dogs' natural behavior in easy-to-follow instructions that will help both the novice dog owner and the professional dog trainer learn how to teach dogs the recall.

My only disappointments were the poor video quality when I viewed the DVD on a HD TV, but that can be attributed to fact that it was recorded in 2004, in the age before most people owned high-definition TV sets.  Additionally, the audio quality is sometimes poor, due to filming from a distance in a sheep pasture with no boom. These issues are no more than minor distractions, though, and her words and actions come through clearly.

She breaks the video down into 7 short sections, each featuring plenty of demonstrations with a variety of dogs:

  Signal: What do you do to encourage your dog to come?
  Response: What you expect your dog to do when you signal?
  Reinforcement: What does your dog receive for responding correctly?
  Scheduling Training Sessions: How and why to vary place, time of day, & number of recalls requested.
  Distractions: Starting with low-level distractions, then increase slowly over time.
  When your dog does not come: Making a plan and being prepared with something the dog really wants.
  Teaching ""STOP"": If dog is running away from you, how to get him to stop & return to you.

If you can get past the outdated technology, this video is a wonderful tool for teaching a very difficult concept.",1307232000,9,1680,4.956989247311828
