8732756,5,B0155STP98,"This is an updated version of Joseph Conrad's ""Hart of Darkness"" Some times it is necessary to place stories in different context so people can relate to them. Look how they changed ""Romeo and Juliet"" into ""West Side Story"". Once before they tried to convert ""Hart of Darkness."" i.e. ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979). However you can see how this version has more redeeming social value. The DVD version allows equal billing with the avocados. You need to watch it once for the story and again to pick up the nuances. Now a chance to go where no man has gone before (and return)

Looks like the U.S. strategic avocado supply is being threatened. You can locate the region on older maps that show where the Mohave Desert was. Seems that there is a bunch of wild native California women be lead by a renegade scientist Dr. Kurtz (Adrienne Barbeau.) They have the munchies for male avocado pickers. Is this a fact or is someone dumping Avocados off the coast?

Watch as the daring trio of Dr. Margo Hunt (Shannon Tweed), Jim (Bill Maher), and Bunny (Karen Mistal) go up the river to investigate. And do not over look the tribe of Donahue's.

As a side note, Bunny got invited to a wet T-shirt contest but could not go as all her T-shirts were dry.",1485043200,,1235,4.5291479820627805

Like a weird fluctuating noise between decent and crap audio. This is disappointing since I love this movie. I need some sort of mono track please.",1477353600,2,274,4.729166666666667

8732760,5,B0155STP98,"Yes, I know what you are thinking, how can this possibly be a 5 star movie? This was such an off-beat comedy, that it was overlooked by the general audience. The title itself is absurd, but wait till you read the synopsis. So funny that you will think to yourself, ""How did I miss this one"".",1457740800,3,291,4.214285714285714
