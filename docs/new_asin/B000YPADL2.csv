3034299,5,B000YPADL2,"This is a really great show. It's easy to get attached to the main characters and all of a sudden you find yourself emotionally invested in their lives and the story. They also have really fanatastic actors, which makes it all the better. Hotorika is really charming as Mizuki, Shun Oguri is wonderful and interesting, and the guy who plays Nakatsu (can't remember his name) is really funny.

I've read the manga and I actually like this version better because it irons out plot problems. For example, in the manga, Mizuki goes to the school simply to be with Sano, which I thought was creepy and weird. In this version, she goes out of duty and guilt to help him because she felt it was her fault he stopped jumping - less fangirl.

Anyway, this is the kind of series you fall in love with. So yeah, you should watch it. But maybe don't buy this particular product - the translations are bad and that makes a world of difference.

*SPOILER BELOW*

Also, I think the end can be misunderstood because Sano and Mizuki don't part as just friends. He kisses her, which is a really big deal for them, and tells her that next time he'll come to her. Unfortunately, she had to leave in the end, but Sano was telling her that they would be together.  Also, there's a special where they are reunited which makes it more clear.",1246838400,,1317,4.448132780082988

3034308,4,B000YPADL2,"For the record, I've never read the original ""Dororo"" manga by Osamu Tezuka, and I probably won't. Not any time soon, anyway.

But for some reason I ended up snaring a copy of the horror/fantasy story ""Dororo,"" a bizarre Japanese fantasy story about a stoic young man who wanders through an unnamed Asian land trying to regain his body parts. It's a strange, dark story with lots of macabre humour and a raucous sidekick, and director Akihiko Shiota keeps the story chugging along to the end.

Years ago a brutal warlord traded forty-eight of his unborn son's body parts to a slew of demons, in exchange for power to dominate the whole world.

The baby was sent adrift on a nearby river, and a kindly old spellcaster gave him artificial limbs and organs. Now the young man (Satoshi Tsumabuki) roams around killing the demons to regain his body parts. A young thief (Kou Shibasaki) learns his story and starts following him around, after dubbing herself by his nickname ""Dororo"" (or ""Monster Child"") and him Hyakkimaru after the sword inside his artificial left arm.

The two of them succeed in slaying several demons -- including voracious caterpillars and an armless dinosaur -- and regain a few more of Hyakkimaru's body parts. But when he kills one demon, it hints at the identity of the man who ruined Hyakkimaru's life. And he inadvertently learns that the cruel warlord who murdered Dororo's family is none other than Daddy Dearest.

""Dororo"" is one of those truly bizarre movies that you usually only find in Asian countries -- they seem a bit more secure with the macabre, bizarre, and totally unbelievable. Seriously, where else can you find a Japanese steampunk castle, a man-eating moth, and a young man whose body is mostly composed of artificial organs and limbs animated by electricity?

And director Akihiko Shiota does a good job juggling the fantasy, horror and family rama, as well as the first buds of a potential love story. And while the story gets dark and bloody in the last third -- including a gruesome duel between family members and Hyakkimaru's bleak battle with two mind-twisting demon dogs -- he's not afraid to splatter it with some rather macabre humour. Hyakkimaru barfs up various organs and reacts oddly when he has the real thing back (""SHUT UP!"") and Dororo repeatedly gets sprayed with demon gore.

While the CGI is merely adequate, the demons encountered are nicely gruesome -- carnivorous caterpillars, leather-faced harpies, and a man-eating tree are amongst them. And the movie takes takes full advantage of the windswept, grassy New Zealand terrain and the many burned temples, shady green forests and dark rivers that our heroes encounter.

And since it takes place in an unspecified Asian land -- Japanese-styled with some European armor and goblets -- Shiota has fun with the details, adding in everything from Japanese monsters to a Frankensteinian body-part-making machine.

Tsumabaki does a pretty solid job as the ""monster child"" -- glum, stoic and tormented by his freakish body, but occasionally he tumbles down in the rain laughing his head off. And while Shibasaki is initially a bit annoying as the sexually confusing urchin, she becomes a much stronger and more likable character once she gains some concern for her new friend.

""Dororo"" has a thoroughly unbelievable plot, but this is surprisingly not enough to overshadow this enjoyably bizarre horror-fantasy story. Strange, quirky and just gross enough.",1226275200,,3463,5.017421602787456

She dresses up like a boy so she can go to an all boys schools. Lots of funny and strange moments ensure. I loved watching all 12 episodes this past week. The drama is very anime-like so it is easy for me to make the transition from anime to drama. Also there are a lot of Osaka in-jokes like Nakatsu-san. Nakatsu is a train station in Osaka City. I used to pass by it on my way to ShinOsaka. Also the school nurse is named Umeda. That's too funny.  No drama based in Osaka can be true without scenes of people eating Okonomiyaki at various Okonomiyaki restaurants. I like Hiroshima style Okonomiyaki myself.
What's really funny is Nakatsu who comes across as a stereotype of the Kansai area. He's loud, funny, and rude and you just want to hang out with him. It was amusing to see the scenes where Nakatsu thought he was turning gay everytime he was with Ashiya (little does he know.)

You got a lot of show for your money, 12 episodes, and if you planned to go to Japan it might even be a good show to watch.  Well, if you plan to do a lot of shopping, eating and dating.  The first disc was great but the second had problems.  The subtitles in the first DVD was done by a pro.  But those done in the second seemed to have been by somebody else - maybe a homeless person found on a street corner in New York City.  Somebody who couldn't spell, who decided to make changes in job titles, and even spell names differently.  This became really hard to handle in the last few episodes where is also seems the person decided to just type random stuff.  Wall Girl became Bi Girl, something became sth and so on.

3034313,5,B000YPADL2,"This is a great show - Mizuki, the main character, has to act like a boy in order to enroll in an all-boys academy in Japan.  She does so because of her past with the main male character, Sano, and in doing so allows him to reopen his interest in track and field.

The show is funny and keeps your interest as you continue watching. There is non-stop acting and something is always going on in the school - whether it's Mizuki having to dress like a girl, or Sano getting drunk and kissing everyone, or trying to catch a panty thief.

I haven't read the manga so I can't say how it compares, but I found this quite engaging in how Sano keeps drawing Mizuki deeper into his life and how all the other relationships evolve towards the end.  It's definitely wacky but not too over the top so it's always interesting.

For, the subtitles, I am going to give it 3 out of 5, for the first half, the subs were excellent, but, the other half, the namings weren't spell correctly, all kinds of grammar mistake, it was like what, now if you paying attention, you should be able to get what is going on, but it makes you mad to think, that you have been tricked, like they were like get the first few episodes right, so if they try out the dvd first before the review, the person can get good review, then it goes, to let's not pretend anymore, and put whatever.  I am not dissing the person I bought from, because I hadn't ever saw something delivered so fast, but you see half of the show is basically in very good subtitles, and then the next half looks deliberately, like they really didn't care about what was subbed, as long as something was.  I can't say it was the sellers fault, because I believe this was wrapped and everything, so there is no way the seller can check a new item, because it's not new no more, if they open it before they send to you.  Other, than the subtitles being bad around half of the drama, I love this drama so far, it's funny, and good to watch.  All, you got to do is pay attention, and you can understand what the bad subtitles in the second half is saying, lol.",1200960000,,1388,4.1033210332103325

All the characters are wonderful and it's a bit differnt from the managa, but it's still fun and follows the basics of the manga. A few of the characters are a little different than the manga, but Honestly this seris will give you a laugh and a feel good time. It was better than I expected.",1200614400,,513,4.191919191919192
3034317,4,B000YPADL2,"As a caveat let me say that I neither speak nor read Japanese, but I did discover the joys of manga several decades ago. Osamu Tezuka's cinematic story telling made grasping the jist of his tales possible. Now, in the 21st Century, the tales that had captivated me of yore such as Hinotori [Phoenix], Buddha, Adolf, and most recently Dororo are arriving in English translation.
 Dororo followed Hinotori as one Tezuka's work to enthrall me early on when it was a 4 volume work from Sunday Comics [more recently 3 volumes from Akita Bunko] featuring a ""Pinocchio"" of ronin hero who overcomes demons in order to reclaim the parts of his body given to them on his birth by his warlord father to assure military supremacy. The ronin triumphs by will alone since he lacks the 5 senses and has swords for arms and legs within their prosthetic scabbards. Dororo is his young urchin sidekick. A 3 volume English translation is due out on Amazon in mid 2008.
 I was surprised to see that there was a 2007 live action film of Dororo listed on Amazon page announcing the manga's English publication. As something to tide me over until next year, I had to have it. Luckily there was a region 1 version of the DVD.
 Except for his father's bargain with the demons and his discovery by the ""Geppetto"" doctor who gives the ronin his functioning body, the film has few tropes from the manga. But the ronin does have the sword arms [but not sword legs] and the demons he fights, although different from those in the manga, are well realized through CGI. In the end he still confronts his birth parents.
 The biggest departure from the manga is Dororo [ah] himself. Where one might expect a stalwart lad like Daigoro in the Lone Wolf and Cub films, the filmmakers chose to do homage to the stage ""Peter Pan"" by having Dororo played by a woman. This is a device used by Tezuka elsewhere [notably in the ""Strange Beings"" portion of Hinotori as seen animated in the equally recommended 13 episode 2004 TV series on 3 disks of Phoenix also available from Amazon] of a girl raised as a boy who can only reclaim her gender by rectifying her father issues.
 The production values, vistas, and story of this film make a good introduction to the spirit of Dororo for both those new to the tale and as something to tide those long familiar with it [at least visually] while waiting for the English volumes in 2008. Get yours soon as I am not sure how long the region 1 with English subtitles will be available. Highly Recommended.",1198022400,,2502,4.551111111111111

3268811,5,B000YPADL2,"This Movie is just fun to watch. I first viewed it in Japan with no subtitles and I like it. It's dark tale of a Tyrant Warlord willing to sacrifice his unborn child to 48 Monster sets a good tone for a bizarre tale. The interaction between the main characters is very good. This movie is light-hearted and a joy to watch, even though some of the monsters are a little cheesy, especially the lizard battle. Reminded me of an old Power Rangers show, but all in all this is a good movie.",1204416000,,485,4.225806451612903
3268812,4,B000YPADL2,"I give this a 4 out of 5 because this is a great drama, very funny.  I still got like 2 and half episodes to go.  For, the subtitles, I am going to give it 3 out of 5, for the first half, the subs were excellent, but, the other half, the namings weren't spell correctly, all kinds of grammar mistake, it was like what, now if you paying attention, you should be able to get what is going on, but it makes you mad to think, that you have been tricked, like they were like get the first few episodes right, so if they try out the dvd first before the review, the person can get good review, then it goes, to let's not pretend anymore, and put whatever.  I am not dissing the person I bought from, because I hadn't ever saw something delivered so fast, but you see half of the show is basically in very good subtitles, and then the next half looks deliberately, like they really didn't care about what was subbed, as long as something was.  I can't say it was the sellers fault, because I believe this was wrapped and everything, so there is no way the seller can check a new item, because it's not new no more, if they open it before they send to you.  Other, than the subtitles being bad around half of the drama, I love this drama so far, it's funny, and good to watch.  All, you got to do is pay attention, and you can understand what the bad subtitles in the second half is saying, lol.",1200960000,,1388,4.1033210332103325
3268813,5,B000YPADL2,"This seris is soo cute, the first episode leaves you curious about the rest of it, it is a drama, but it's also got a wondeful set of characters and I honestly love the charater playing Sano, he fits the part really well. All the characters are wonderful and it's a bit differnt from the managa, but it's still fun and follows the basics of the manga. A few of the characters are a little different than the manga, but Honestly this seris will give you a laugh and a feel good time. It was better than I expected.",1200614400,,513,4.191919191919192
3268814,4,B000YPADL2,"As a caveat let me say that I neither speak nor read Japanese, but I did discover the joys of manga several decades ago. Osamu Tezuka's cinematic story telling made grasping the jist of his tales possible. Now, in the 21st Century, the tales that had captivated me of yore such as Hinotori [Phoenix], Buddha, Adolf, and most recently Dororo are arriving in English translation.
 Dororo followed Hinotori as one Tezuka's work to enthrall me early on when it was a 4 volume work from Sunday Comics [more recently 3 volumes from Akita Bunko] featuring a ""Pinocchio"" of ronin hero who overcomes demons in order to reclaim the parts of his body given to them on his birth by his warlord father to assure military supremacy. The ronin triumphs by will alone since he lacks the 5 senses and has swords for arms and legs within their prosthetic scabbards. Dororo is his young urchin sidekick. A 3 volume English translation is due out on Amazon in mid 2008.
 I was surprised to see that there was a 2007 live action film of Dororo listed on Amazon page announcing the manga's English publication. As something to tide me over until next year, I had to have it. Luckily there was a region 1 version of the DVD.
 Except for his father's bargain with the demons and his discovery by the ""Geppetto"" doctor who gives the ronin his functioning body, the film has few tropes from the manga. But the ronin does have the sword arms [but not sword legs] and the demons he fights, although different from those in the manga, are well realized through CGI. In the end he still confronts his birth parents.
 The biggest departure from the manga is Dororo [ah] himself. Where one might expect a stalwart lad like Daigoro in the Lone Wolf and Cub films, the filmmakers chose to do homage to the stage ""Peter Pan"" by having Dororo played by a woman. This is a device used by Tezuka elsewhere [notably in the ""Strange Beings"" portion of Hinotori as seen animated in the equally recommended 13 episode 2004 TV series on 3 disks of Phoenix also available from Amazon] of a girl raised as a boy who can only reclaim her gender by rectifying her father issues.
 The production values, vistas, and story of this film make a good introduction to the spirit of Dororo for both those new to the tale and as something to tide those long familiar with it [at least visually] while waiting for the English volumes in 2008. Get yours soon as I am not sure how long the region 1 with English subtitles will be available. Highly Recommended.",1198022400,,2502,4.551111111111111
8233741,1,B000YPADL2,"I hate this DVD. It can't play in my DVD player, laptop or even on computer. I think the region code is not correct.",1376265600,,116,3.875
8233742,5,B000YPADL2,"Now Ill start by saying that the five stars is for the Drama itself and not the DVD and youll see why in a second.

First Ill get into the drama, The Drama centers around a man named Iwase Ken, it starts off with him running to his best friends wedding, Rei, despite him being in love with her, the groom being his old teacher Tada sensei. After the wedding, is a slideshow where Ken starts to wonder how he never confessed to Rei after knowing her for 14 years,A fairy who lives in the church where the wedding is going on notices him and decides to give him a second chance by letting him travel back in time with the exception that he can only travel back in time to the start of the day a picture in the slideshow was taken. So in other words every episode is him going back in time and fixing something he wished he hadnt done or doing somehing he wish he had done.

Now that may sound boring but its only 12 episodes, just enough so it doesnt feel too repetitive.

Not too mention the main characters are funny and the storyline is pretty interesting. Theres also character growth in pretty much every episode.

NOW WAIT!! The DVD obviously has different people working on this cause a couple episodes are well subtitled (though some of them go by fast, even for those who are used to reading subs like me) while other episodes subtitles make ABSOLUTLY NO SENSE AT ALL!! I watched it online a couple times so it wasn't that big of a deal becouse I already got the jist of what was happening. Also in the bad subs they even change the names to something weird like Rei becomes Li, Iwase Ken becomes Yan Laiken and Tada sensei becomes Duodian Teacher.

Here are some examples of the mistranslations.
One of the characters told Ken ""You are not drive""
Also Ken was saying to himself ""Li is my lovest person in the world""

ALso the only subs that are on here are English and chinese, no japanese kanji which some people might like for studying japanese though its not that big of a deal.

So anyway if you want to watch this, do it online or you can buy this dvd but be somewhat fluent in japanese.

BUT SERIOUSLY THIS DRAMA IS AMAZING WATCH IT!!!",1325548800,,2149,4.301980198019802
8233743,3,B000YPADL2,"I love this show!!!!! I read the books and watched the whole thing online to make sure it was worth buying and it was, the only problem is whoever decided to do the english subtitles is waaaaaaaaaaaay off.  They make next to NO sense and they even give the characters different names!  Now its no problem for me cause I know the series and i can watch and know whats happening without really having to read the subtitles but i just wanted to put this as a warning to others who may buy it.",1310688000,,489,4.191489361702128
8233744,3,B000YPADL2,"The Secret Garden is something different that I picked up on a chance.  I didn't read too much about it before I started watching it.  I will say this, the characters are really great, but rather unpredictable.  I recommend this tv show to girls and boys who are into reading comic books and want to see the sad and happy side of writing comic books.  The plot revolves around a young woman who is an editor for a fashion magazine.  The fashion magazine gets suspended and she finds herself as an editor for a mangaka, who is actually composed of five men disguised as a woman, in order to appeal to the girl readers. Intrigued?  As much as these men write, they do not know the first thing about real women, which makes for an excellent story line.  For those who do decide to buy the product, don't freak out if you can't read the DVD menu.  Unfortunately, the copy I had did not have the menu translated.  I had to use the subtitles button on my remote to get the English subtitles to work while watching the episodes.",1267660800,,1021,4.35978835978836

I had previously watched it on youtube, and enjoyed it so much I decided to purchase it so that I could watch it whenever I felt like it without having to log on. The quality was good, the packaging was adorable, unfortunately, the subtitles are horrendous. I can tolerate typos and such I'm not a picky person, but a lot of the translations are so bad that a person watching it for the first time would have a great deal of trouble understanding. Luckily, I'd seen it few times prior, and already understood what was going on. I recommend discussing your buy with the seller first, do your research (as I will do next time). This is not a complaint against the seller, I had a good experience with them, its just a good lesson to learn for anyone purchasing foreign films.",1260057600,,817,4.453333333333333

I think everyone should watch it. I watched it about three times already and still like it. But I fast forward during the sano high jump parts. I also let others watch it and they enjoyed it too. Also, if you like this show I suggest you should also watch the kdrama 1st shop of coffee prince. That one is pretty good too. It follows pretty much the same concept as this show.  But this one is funnier. I guess it's Because it's set in a high school. But over all you should get it! Get it! Get it!",1256688000,,654,4.109375

this item was new and sealed up so i am sure it has nothing to do with the seller and that it was just a error by the Publisher",1255046400,,575,3.8728813559322033
