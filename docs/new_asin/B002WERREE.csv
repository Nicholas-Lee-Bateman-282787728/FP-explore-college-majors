8382996,4,B002WERREE,I got this to watch while running on the treadmill and it inspired me to run on trails.  Great fun!,1357257600,,99,3.95
8382997,2,B002WERREE,"I purchased the dvd based on the previous recommendation.  I did not find the dvd helpful and wish that I had saved my $29.99.  I will be donating this dvd to my local library.  There are some helpful tips but they could have been stated in a 5 minute podcast.  The dvd uses the same running scenes over and over.  I was really looking forward to some really  helpful tips for ""normal"" runners.  I do not see myself flying down the trails at the speed of the ""actor."" It would have been cool to show some scenes of him flying down the hill but then show techniques of running down the hill - for normal people.  It reminded my a lot of a Monte Python movie, the scene where they keep running up the same hill.  My recommendation, if your really want to watch it, would be to go to your local library or borrow someone's copy.  I am sorry to say that it was definitely not worth the money.",1268438400,6,888,4.170588235294118
