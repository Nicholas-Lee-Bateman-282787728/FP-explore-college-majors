2162201,5,B00062J0Z8,This is the best cartoon I've ever seen. I never knew it existed until a few months ago when a friend of mine told me to check it out. Now I watch it all the time and introduce many other to it. The characters are so weird you can't help but enjoy it. It's based out of the US so it's not as popular here. You can catch the show on the Cartoon Network in the middle of the night on Adult Swim. Finally a show I can't get sick of! I recommend it!!!,1120694400,,447,3.765957446808511
2162202,5,B00062J0Z8,"I own all three of these volumes which I bought separtely. This hilarious show about three eccentric food items named Frylock, Master Shake, and Meatwad is right now, my favorite show on all of Cartoon Network. I laugh everytime I see the show! With random humor and funny jokes, it is a hoot! I'm excited because they will release Volume Four Novemeber 22, 2005, have new episodes on Adult Swim starting December, and a FEATURE LENGTH MOVIE coming newxt year! What an Aqua Teen treat!!",1112918400,2,486,4.729411764705882

2162204,5,B00062J0Z8,"check it out.  this is straight up one of the funniest cartoons ever.  It pushes the envelope nicely of what can be allowed on tv, braving whole new territory with the rest of it's adult swim crew mates. i'm not sure what it is about repetition that is funny, but this show has mastered it.  they have a way of spinning sillyness and awkward pauses into pure gold. if you think gratuitous violence and random acts of extreme stupidity are funny, know loverboy sucks, and midgets make you laugh, this one's for you.  and if not, who needs you really.",1107216000,2,549,4.46

2162206,5,B00062J0Z8,"If you like funny shows like Simpsons and Family guy, this is for you! It's one of my favorite cartoons with sophisticated, earthy dry humor. It's extremely unpredicable and creative, the best of adult swim's line-up. Meatwad is the best! and Carl, Inignok and Ol' Drippy,Happytime Harry! Buy it!",1099180800,10,296,5.061224489795919

8037360,1,B00062J0Z8,I got ripped off on this order! I was supposed to get THREE dvds and only received ONE. I was charged for three of them though.  I don't know what to do to get my full order.  I am EXTREMELY UNHAPPY with this transaction.,1322179200,,221,4.0
8037361,1,B00062J0Z8,"(update) - Amazon is currently charing more for the 3-season set, they they do if you just but the three seasons separately.  Don't get sucked in.  Whenever you see a set like this, compare the price to buying the individual pieces.  If the price drops, I'll go back to my original high rating (see review below)

While this is a great set, missing out on season 4 means missing some of the very best of ATHF.  So either get the season 1-4 set, or get this and add in season 4.  Those cover what I think is the very best of ATHF. Since then, it seems like since then they've been straining a bit to come up with great concepts.

There's no question this is an uneven show. Some episodes don't work at all. But that's more than made up for by those episodes that leave you laughing so hard you cry, while your brian quietly explodes at the insanity of it all.

While this has worn off for me a bit from when I was first enthralled by it's sheer dada-esque insanity, the best
episodes still transcend to inspired levels of bizarre, gross, tweaked humor. When your starting premise is a giant talking
shake, fries, and wad of meat living in New Jersey, how wrong can you go?

As far as my personal ratings, on a scale of 1 to 4...Season 1; `MC Pee Pants', `Love Mummy',
`Dumber Dolls' ***1/2, `Escape from Leprecopolis', `Circus',***1/4 ; `Bus of the Undead', `Ol' Drippy',
`Revenge of the Moonanites', `Dumber Days', `Bad Replicant'***. Remaining 8 episodes **1/2 or **3/4.

Season 2: `Mail Order Bride', `Universal Remonster', `Super Bowl', `Super Squatter', `Super Spore',
`Super Computer' ***1/4. `Super Birthday Snake', `Super Sir Loin', `Meat Zone', `Super Trivia' ***. Remaining 3 **3/4.

Season 3: The Clowning ***3/4, Total Recarl, The Last One ***1/2, Revenge of the Trees, The Cloning, Broodwitch, The Cubing, The Shaving ***1/4, Frat Aliens, The Dressing, Remaining 2 **3/4.

If you like strange, gonzo humor (Monty Python would be my generation's touchstone) and/or out-there
adult animation, you owe it to yourself to give this a try -- and give it a couple of episodes to let your head get into what the creators are doing.",1299974400,,2135,4.709677419354839

It was such a good deal, that I just kept the package and went to Best Buy and just re-bought the damaged discs. I would highly recommend, but contact the seller and ask about shipping.",1281484800,,304,4.350877192982456

The so-called toys were buried as witches and defecated upon, and hurled at predators who were awoken by the screams of the children.
