The information, techniques and demos are well organized, clearly presented and easy to follow. I have viewed this quality DVD numerous times in my studio and continue to be re-inspired by it. Artists from any medium will find many useful techniques in this wonderful DVD that encourage new creative exploration. The gorgeous packaging itself is worth the price! Don't pass this one up. . .",1268870400,3,498,4.928571428571429
4082620,5,B003804YQ0,"This DVD is highly informative, detailed, and helpful about the basics (and more) of many encaustic techniques.  It is valuable to beginners or experienced painters, encaustic artists, and those engaged in textile and fiber arts, as a natural extension of what they may already be doing.  It is also so much fun to watch!  Ms. Woolf is highly entertaining and sparkling.  Her up-close demos, personal stories, and expert tips combine into a delightful 2 hour tutorial which truly feels like an intimate visit in her studio, while she works.  The quality of the videography is first-rate - the camera work gets in so close to the work surface, better than you'd ever see in a class.  The instructions are clear, amply demonstrated, and easy to follow.  You can't go wrong with this wonderful DVD!  I and have watched it several times, each time picking up new information! Love it!!",1267056000,13,881,4.865771812080537

8390926,5,B003804YQ0,"This DVD proved to be everthing i would expect from Daniella Woolf. It is full of exciting, inspiring and colourful ideas. I savoured every minute of it and could not wait to get down and dirty with some watercolours, paper and my sewing machine. Her Ideas are unique to anything i have seen before. I am new to this medium and although books are my first love,watching and learning the demonstrations in this DVD are invaluable. It was like having a friend come over and demonstrate just for you...I would highly recommend this DVD..",1314835200,,534,4.691489361702128

""In this place called Lighthouse Field, there are these leaves, which are so varied in color...I try and pick up the pink ones the most, but in combination, they really do it for me"", Daniella says as she goes on to explain how to create your own encaustic work of art using things 'found in nature'.",1294617600,5,924,7.25
8390928,1,B003804YQ0,"WARNING: the Textile Sensibility in this DVD is non-existent. Yes, she USED to be a textile artist. But never does she say what effect that has on her encaustic work, nor is that effect evident. Yes, she does sew things together, but not textiles. I bought this hoping for an intro to using fabrics in encaustic paintings. Except for five seconds at the very end, when she waves two pieces of fabric she had dipped in wax, fabric is not mentioned. Had she not put ""Textile"" in the title of the DVD, I would not have expected textiles, and would have been completely satisfied with what she did present. Unfortunately for me and my pocketbook, she implied textiles had something to do with this DVD. They don't.",1293926400,9,710,4.5984251968503935
8390929,5,B003804YQ0,"Just finished watching Daniella's DVD.... What a treat.  LOVED the processes she shared, loved that she was so honest and open, loved her ideas.  GREAT DVD.",1285545600,2,156,4.961538461538462
8390930,5,B003804YQ0,"I liked Daniella Woolf's video ""Encaustic With a Textile Sensibility"" on many levels.  She explains and demonstrates things clearly, inspires with her own beautiful artwork, and is just such a warm and authentic person on camera.  I recommend this video highly.",1285372800,,261,5.341463414634147
8390931,5,B003804YQ0,"Daniella's video is truly a pleasure to watch.  She shares her wealth of knowledge with the viewer, never leaving out any steps - you can follow her instructions and you WILL have success!  In spite of the volume of information Daniella gives the video never gets bogged down - it moves right along at an excellent speed.  The information is thorough but easy to understand.

Daniella goes through a full range of possibilities and alternatives that can be tried with encaustic.  She loves to experiment but never loses sight of the underlying requirements for creating sound encaustic artwork.  An amazing amount of practical information is included.  You can watch the video again for a refresher as needed, and you will notice new ideas and possibilities that you missed the first time around!

I really recommend this video to anyone who wants to try encaustic - Daniella will give you a sound background that will let you be successful the first time around!!",1273276800,18,964,4.907407407407407
8390932,5,B003804YQ0,"This DVD is so comprehensive, it took me three viewings to get through it. Danielle has an easy going approach as she reveals technique after technique. Her work is beautiful and she leaves you with the energy and desire to try your hand with encaustics. Too bad there are only 5 stars available for a rating!!",1273017600,4,310,4.553571428571429
8390933,5,B003804YQ0,I've read several books on the subject of encaustics but you get a much better sense of the process when you see it in live action. Daniella Woolf is a great teacher and very creative.,1272067200,4,184,4.285714285714286
8390934,5,B003804YQ0,"The best way to learn encaustic is to see it demonstrated.  Over the years, Daniella Woolf has developed a really great learning tool.  She knows what she is talking about.  This DVD invites the newest beginner to the most experienced encaustic artist to watch it over and over again from beginning to end.  Her demonstrations are very clear and easy to understand.  This DVD is definitely a must for any artist interested in learning encaustic.",1269648000,8,445,4.88
