2561802,5,B000FDFSM2,"Ok...I own a lot of Gospel DVDs and this is DEFINITELY one i'm happy to own. From the very beginning (the tribute to the late O'Landa Draper) on throughout to the rest of the recording, you will dance, praise and worship...and that's if you're not a singer. If you sing in a choir, you will more than likely wear your voice out :-D Anyhow, I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who truly wants a great DVD.",1151625600,3,406,4.285714285714286
2561803,5,B000FDFSM2,"Ya know... I had no idea I could be touched like I was, this is REAL! I was scrolling through like I always do, and found this title. Little did I know, I would be pulled into the world of these beautiful people. This film should be on the big screen, as a reminder that we still care and we hear you. To all the sisters that was hurt in this film, and the brother that didn't I have a father...I say keep God first. You may feel like he got away with it, but your real father is in heaven.

2561809,4,B000FDFSM2,"Yes, for one hasn't gone through incest personally, the daughters' continued relationship with father is upsetting. I want to castrate him slowly. But these sisters are lovely and the relationship with the film maker seems to be lovely. Out of ugliness can come beauty.",1408492800,,269,5.136363636363637

2561811,5,B000FDFSM2,"DVD quality is crystal clear here; I couldn't ask for anything better. Me being a gospel lover, it's always one thing to listen to a live gospel recording on CD, but it's a whole different story to see it on DVD or VHS, and this DVD is no exception. I love it; it's a great complement to the CD.",1407542400,,295,4.016949152542373
2561812,4,B000FDFSM2,"So much to say, yet speechless at the same time.  Many thoughts, questions and feelings swirled within me while watching this film.  If I hadn't known several women who've been victims of physical and sexual abuse, I probably wouldn't have understood some of the things that were part of the dysfunction.

The difficulty in rating a documentary that is this personal is that it's like rating someone's life.  When 4 stars equal ""I like it,"" I'm not saying that I like it in an entertainment genre.  It was painful to watch and illustrated the complexities of human behavior and family dynamics.

Of course, there is always a tendency to think ""If I went through this, I would..."" but we really don't know.  And I am forever grateful that I will never know.  And very sorry that these adults went through this horror.  I've often been amazed that children can grow up and function at all, considering the childhoods they've experienced.

I'm left with mixed feelings about it and  feel that what wasn't stated spoke very loudly.  I'm no one's judge or jury, and I certainly am not putting myself in that position in judging their lives.  But I can't help but wonder about how it felt for these sisters to be so honest for all the world to see - was it cathartic?  Why a film rather than group therapy?  Is Chico detached from his emotions and filming (as he seems to be when talking about the shooting), or are those emotions inside?  Lots of questions arose as a result of this film.

Overall, I really do wish all of them happiness, peace and joy.  And a release from the anger that is just under the surface and ready to bubble over at any moment.",1396569600,,1649,4.532203389830508
2561813,4,B000FDFSM2,"Forgiving doesn't mean forgetting.

Forgiveness sets you free from your past abuse.

That doesn't mean you should or even can establish a loving relationship with the abuser.
The knowledge of his past actions allows you to know he can't be trusted and that you need to protect yourself and your family by staying far away from the perpetrator.

Forgive him, pray for his redemption and be done with him and the abuse.
GOD Bless you all.",1393632000,4,436,4.7105263157894735
2561814,5,B000FDFSM2,I think every household should have this dvd and watch with the family.  I think it is vital that all families learn and understand the depths of molestation and the effects it has on everyone.  This story was so damaging to this family and enlightening to the outside world.  It is an educational piece that can help so many.,1393027200,,326,4.491525423728813
2561815,5,B000FDFSM2,"I love documentaries of all kinds to see different people's lives and perspectives. Being a professional in the psychology field this film hit me deep. Such a horrible, repulsive childhood these women had yet they still were able to be around their father later in life. Not sure if this documentary was skewed because it was their brother who decided to make the movie and interview them. Which is understandable because he himself is still looking for answers and forgiveness for shooting his sister. I feel like a lot was missing from the women's story.  I felt there was more left unsaid.",1391212800,,592,4.803921568627451
2561816,5,B000FDFSM2,"Although this is raw and honest talk about about incest and violence within one family I still feel they have so much underlying anger and self doubt.  Maybe that's what make this so haunting - so honest, yet stopping short of an implosion. Regardless of waiting for the other proverbial shoe to drop the bravery and the willingness to explore those feelings can't help but touch a nerve.",1390780800,,388,4.705882352941177
2561817,3,B000FDFSM2,"I watched this documentary, and I wasn't able to sleep afterwards.  When Angie said ""My first orgasm was from daddy"" I was repulsed, but I got it.  It is what is was, and we all remember the first person who brought us into the sexual world.  In Angies's case, it was her father.  For all the evil that this man is, he held the power and like the the therapst said the incest became the ""powerful reward.""  It's a maddening undertaking, trying to figure out why these women allow this sick man in their lives but feel the most anger towards their mother.  But I get that too, as she is the villain because they feel she should have protected them more, when she was equally a victim.  I think the mother, as demented as she is was the only one who made sense.  Unfortunately, she fails to understand the dynamics of abuse and incest and is resentful that the kids welcomed their dad with open arms.  I believe the mom was more upset with that than the incest. The documentary leaves more questions than answers: What happened to the sisters after the filming?  What about the children that the father had from the second marriage (why a woman would marry a sexual predator is beyond me, but she was a kid herself when she met this pedophile).  I think there is something lacking in the film, and it's David's detachment from the subjects and the victimization his sisters experienced which he did not.  This is strange and unsettling documentary.",1389139200,12,1446,4.519230769230769
2561818,2,B000FDFSM2,"Ok, so I was intrigued by this video as many people gave it good reviews. However, I felt that this documentary left me with more questions than answers.

The mother of the girls writing the letter to them to basically stay out of her life left me shocked and dismayed, however the interview the author had with his mother, who said she was upset at how her daughters ran right back to their father after he got out of jail, made me understand how she came to that decision.

I feel like this family could have benefited from intense counseling and the relationship that the girls have with their father now, and what seems to be a lack of a relationship with any other men, just seems off and odd.

To be honest, after watching this, I felt unsettled and uneasy. I feel like the the grown sisters are still be victimized by their father, and even talking about the 'rapes and whatnot' like its acceptable behavior  makes me sick. I wish I never watched this.",1388793600,5,959,4.431818181818182
2561819,5,B000FDFSM2,"This documentary will blow you away! family dynamics can come in all forms, and this one has one heck of a story. I think this puts a cap on shock theory for real.",1382918400,,163,3.9696969696969697
2561820,4,B000FDFSM2,"This movie was quite moving.  It told the story of a sick father, abandoning mother and the impact that trauma has on one throughout her life.",1378684800,,142,4.461538461538462
2561821,3,B000FDFSM2,"This was ok but I've seen much better (i.e, The Central Park Five.)  It's hard to believe what happened but it's even harder to belive they still have contact w/their father.",1374537600,,174,4.612903225806452
2561822,4,B000FDFSM2,"I wish Mr. Colvard would have went a little deeper - i had so many questions - like why did Angel not testify, what did the father mean when he said 12 other soldiers on Fort Dix had done the same thing?

I was amazed at it and watched it for free and then paid to watch again - it was just strange to see these girls interact with their own personal so called tamed monster.  To watch another women marry a known monster, wow blew me away. To watch his sister make like the whole thing was okay because she told her brother off.  Wow!  People really do need a higher power to save them.

I feel sorry for their kids.",1371427200,4,617,4.024590163934426
2561823,5,B000FDFSM2,"Watching this helps me understand my own mother and what she went through more. People do not realize the level of acceptance that a child being abused must go through to survive. That acceptance stays with them through their whole lives sometimes, and its not for anyone to judge them on that. My heart breaks for these four siblings and their braveness of telling their story is inspiring. I hope healing and love fills their lives in some capacity.",1371168000,9,451,4.7215189873417724
2561824,5,B000FDFSM2,"An honest, haunting and disturbing movie. I must commend the producer for having the ""guts"" to air this very ""dirty laundry"" of his family's secrets.",1370044800,6,149,5.0
2561825,5,B000FDFSM2,As a social worker in New York and I have heard many stories of children being taken advantage of by their parents. I have worked with these adults and this story has helped me to better understand the aftermath of incest.  Bravo to the producer & family members.  You all have increased my knowledge base.  Thank you for sharing your story and pain.,1369612800,4,350,4.523809523809524
2561826,2,B000FDFSM2,I believe it would have been in the best interest for the film maker and his family to go for counselling instead of doing the film.  It appeared to me that the lifetime damage done to this family had not been addressed to professionals for healing.  Making money and achieving awards as a result of the documentary isn't going to heal these individuals. As a health professional I'd say this is a sad and disturbing film with no resolution.,1359849600,5,441,4.569620253164557
2561827,5,B000FDFSM2,"Watched this documentary last night. I found this to be a complex family, with deep issues.
I can honestly say it is a must see. There were many things I did not understand, but there was no judgement..
I believe as a family they should have extensive therapy if they have not already started that process.
I recently read a quote, "" Forgiveness does not equal approval."" Chico seemed to be the only one to understand that.
Excellent documentary!!! Excellent story!!!",1358294400,8,467,4.777777777777778
2561828,3,B000FDFSM2,"This documentary has been receiving accolades and I really didn't think it was done very well.  The daughters are wonderful at telling their stories and talking about what they have done with their lives.  However, their brother (the filmmaker) is judgmental of them which really bothered me.  I was an abused child and I maintained my relationship with both parents until they were in their 80s.  It is much more typical for abused children to maintain a relationship with their abusive parent than for them to walk away.  Its ironic that the one child who was not abused, the filmmaker, was the one who cut off ties with his parents.  I give the sisters huge props for never playing the victim and going on with their lives to the best of their ability.  However, I think their story could have been told in a fairer, less judgmental and more emotionally rich way.",1354752000,8,866,4.657894736842105
2561829,5,B000FDFSM2,This is a true story told by the family who lived through it. Riveting and truly takes you on a journey.,1353801600,,104,4.0
2561830,5,B000FDFSM2,"We watched this last night and it was one of the most powerful and authentic documentaries that I've ever seen.  We stayed up talking after it ended because it got our memories and minds going so much.  It is about the family dynamics after extreme sexual and physical abuse and it shows the sickness of not only the abuser but the twisted/wrecked mental state of the adult women as a result of being abused. The obvious question after learning how they were abused is how can they have anything to do with him after that and this documentary really dives into that. It was shocking how they made accommodations and excuses for him.  There is no justification for doing what he did, none at all...but they made them in their minds and kept a relationship with him, even calling him Daddy and becoming jealous when he'd give one daughter more attention than another. This guy abused his daughters in absolutely horrific ways, but the family protected him and sold out anyone who wasn't willing to protect, excuse and cover up. I was almost as horrified by their behavior as I was his. Not a moment of it felt manufactured, it was like you were a fly on the wall during the actual discussions.",1346803200,10,1191,4.582159624413146
2561831,4,B000FDFSM2,"For an earlier recorded DVD, Hezekiah did a good job in this dvd.  Some of the camera shots are not very clean, and some of the crowd wasn't ""preped"" for a dvd recording, but the choir is on point as usual and gifted!  I liked that there are guest groups on here in addition to Hezekiah and choir.
There is a bonus music video at the end worth watching.  Worth having in your gospel dvd collection.",1218585600,,398,4.2105263157894735

8121256,5,B000FDFSM2,"WOW!  Did this ever hit home, my family has had a similar situation to this though not my immediate family.  This really helped me to better understand what was going on with the girls and why they felt the way they did.  Incest is way to common a problem and this movie helped me a lot in my life's journey.  Highly recommend!",1507766400,,327,4.225806451612903

8121258,5,B000FDFSM2,"This brutal story of sexual abuse and dysfunction is beyond words.  Watching this documentary evoked so many emotions ranging from anger, sadness and hope for this family.  Many people try to hide this type of abuse or act like it never happens but watching this documentary puts it all out there.  I felt so bad for the entire family and how it affects their lives.  So many people was hurt by a cycle of abuse.  I have to commend Chico Colvard and his sisters for taking the courage to speak openly and honestly about their childhood.",1456704000,,536,4.541666666666667
8121259,5,B000FDFSM2,"Horrific story to tell that SO many can and do relate to 100%. This kept me in prayer for all that have dealt w this matter. It kept me more prayer for those who knew about it and seem to think it's okay or that what's done was done. To forgive someone for their actions is one thing. But to act like something of this magnitude never happened; and to relax to the point other children are permitted, encouraged, close proximity to the same person that's never apologized to the children he violated (that HE created), troubles me. Life is very interesting. This documentary.... prepare yourself.",1454976000,,596,4.632075471698113
