1998076,5,B0001GH5TW,"Dreamlike.  Hypnotic.  Surreal.  Creepy.  Yes, Robert Altman's Three Women is all of those things.  It's also a true cinematic masterpiece.  Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek give two of the best performances ever put on film as Millie and Pinky, two assistants at a convalescent home in Desert Springs, California.  Who is the most pathetic?  Millie, who fancies herself a hip social butterfly when, in reality, she is either ignored by or made fun of by those she considers her confidants and admirers?  Or Pinky, the childlike woman who idolizes her?  It's a toss up, but these two women become roommates in a swinging singles apartment complex(The Purple Sage)and it isn't long before things start getting really weird.  Shelley Duvall's performance here is mesmerizing in it's detail.  In improvised monologues she rambles on and on about her (non-existant) beaus, her fab recipe for Chocolate Pudding Tarts, and her chance at becoming the new Brett Girl! It's hysterical!  Sissy Spacek is just as hilarious in her wide eyed infatuation with Millie.  But if you're thinking this movie is a comedy you are dead wrong.  After a bump on the head during an attempted suicide, Pinky begins to think she IS Millie.  Is she?  Observing at a distance is Willie, the third woman, the pregnant wife of a former cowboy who paints bizarre portraits of a rape and murder among reptilian aliens.  Once this theft of personality gets underway, the movie really starts to sink it's hooks in you.  Based on a dream, writer/producer/director Altman has created a visually stunning (three-wheelers racing across the desert), provacotive, enthralling character study of three fascinating people.  Forget the ambiguous ending--the real question is why hasn't this movie ever been released on video or dvd?  I taped it off cable almost 15 years ago and wouldn't sell my copy for anything.  For any serious Altman fan--this film is a must own.",1062633600,49,1923,5.057324840764331
1998077,5,B0001GH5TW,"Eight years on since I saw this film on TV I've been dreaming of it's being featured again but all in vain. Shelley Duvall's performance in this film is just scintillating. Winning the Best Actress Award of the Cannes International Film Festival is but an understatement of what she has accomplished. Robert Altman's free-wheeling mode of directing unveiled the hidden talent of Shelley Duvall as a gifted actor. Owning a DVD of ""Three Women"" definitely is my dream.",1040601600,,466,4.987179487179487
1998078,5,B0001GH5TW,"I was profoundly confused through the first half an hour of the film but then I was hypnotized and by the end of the first hour I was thoroughly seduced.  Shelley Duvall plays one of the more endearing wackjobs ever essayed on film.  The fact that her rambling, pathetic monologues were improvised underscores the fact that she is one of our most underrated actresses.  Sissy Spacek plays a feral wage slave who rooms with Ms. Duvall.  Their relationship is deeply embarrassing...it predates 'Chuck and Buck' by twenty-five years years.
It's ultimately about women who run with the wolves or possibly it's about the queasy allure of bummed-out, low-rent, consumer-focused California living...who cares? The characters stick with the viewer like a bad hangover.
And Shelley Duvall...where are you?",1030838400,17,796,5.244094488188976

Unconventional, unpredictable and original, Three Women defies description. It is devoid of any tradiational narrative devices and the film plunges you into a world you have never seen before. Three Women is strange, surreal,creepy and unlike anything you have ever experienced, uniquely Altman.  Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek are unforgettable in their roles and Altman's skillful direction is nothing short of amazing. Highly recommended.",975369600,14,596,5.208333333333333
1998088,5,B0001GH5TW,"SPOILER ALERT....

The 3 Women are all mentally ill.  Pinky.  Millie.  Willie.

Pinky shows up out of nowhere, taking on a job with old people that requires no skills.  It becomes clear that she doesn't know who she is, having no social security number and not even knowing her own real name. She is shy and very quiet, with almost no personality.  Pinky meets Millie on her first day of work, and Pinky idolizes Millie because she is outspoken and talks constantly. When Millie announces that she needs a roommate, Pinky moves in with her. Pinky copies Millie's social security number and copies Millie in every way that she can, she follows her around everywhere, and even reads her entire diary.  Pinky suddenly announces that her real name is Mildred, and it becomes clear that Pinky wants to take over Millie's identity and literally become her.

It becomes clear that the one thing that Pinky and Millie have in common is that they are both all alone in the world, but they don't want to be.

Millie is aching for attention, but does not get it from anyone. She lives in a singles apartment building where everyone ignores her, just as her co-workers ignore her, but she never gives up trying to fit in with everyone she meets. She believes that she has great style, but she is really out of touch with everything around her.  She overflows with the color yellow, in her clothes, purses, car, and everything in her apartment. She sleeps with men whom she believes are her boyfriends but who don't care about her.

The third woman is Willie. She is also clearly mentally ill.  She never speaks, even when directly spoken to.  She is pregnant by her husband, Edgar, who is always drunk and sleeps with everyone and owns the apartment building and diner and teaches all of the women how to shoot a gun.  Willie paints strange murals everywhere.  She seems to be trying to communicate through her murals, but no one is listening.

This movie is very slow, but not boring, because it held my interest all the way through, trying to understand the characters.  The movie picks up quickly in the last half hour, and the last ten minutes are very fast.  I love Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall.  I watched this movie through to the end mainly because they were in it, and they were amazing together.

After Millie and Pinky have an argument, Pinky's mind snaps, and she jumps into the pool, causing a head injury and coma. Millie feels responsible.  When Pinky wakes from the coma, Millie has found her parents for her and brings them to the hospital to see her, but Pinky does not recognize them and screams that she does not know them and wants them gone.  Pinky has awoken from the coma with a new, strong personality, the exact opposite of what she was before the coma.  Pinky begins believing that the apartment is hers and that she is Millie, even taking Millie's diary and writing into it as her own. Millie had been sleeping with Edgar, and so Pinky begins sleeping with him. Pinky starts laughing like a man, smoking, drinking, and she actually steals Millie's car.  Millie is overwhelmed by the changes in Pinky, and she deals with it by becoming the shy and quiet one.  It is like Millie and Pinky have switched personalities.

Edgar goes to Millie and Pinky in the middle of the night, announcing that Willie is in labor, and he has left her alone at home, and he basically does not care.  Pinky had just woken up from a nightmare, and her personality seems to have changed again, into a frightened child.  Millie takes Pinky with her to Willie, who is in labor at home alone, but it is too late to move her. Pinky is told to get a doctor, but she just stands in the doorway, frozen, watching the labor. Millie delivers Willie's stillborn baby, and both of their personalities crack also.

In the last five minutes of the movie, we see that Millie has now taken on the personality of a mother to both Pinky and Willie, and is now a very stiff and stern personality.  They both actually call her Mother.  The three of them are living together and running the diner together.  Edgar is dead, and it is obvious that these women have killed him.  Pinky now goes by the name of Mildred and her personality is completely childlike.  Willie's personality is basically the same as before, just a shell of a person, but at least she talks now.  Millie orders them both around and they obey her.

The end is really creepy as we are left not knowing what will happen with these three mentally ill women together, who do not know that anything is wrong with them.  There is a close-up of a cluster of tires which used to belong to Edgar's truck, and it is implied that Edgar is buried there.

Throughout the entire movie, annoying horror music plays.  This is a very deep movie.  Either you get it or you don't.  Either you love it or you hate it.",1488067200,,4844,4.520689655172414

I have no words to describe how awful this movie was. It moved at a snails pace and had hardly any story to tell.  I will not detail for any reader what was so terrible about this movie because I don't want to waste anymore time out of my life. But a clue for you may be that there was a shot of a delivery truck bringing drinks to the bar. It had zero to do with the plot and yet the director showed it driving up the road for about a minute and a half. That kind of sums up the whole movie for me.

1998118,5,B0001GH5TW,"This is one of Altman's masterpieces that is frequently overlooked.  As others have pointed out, there is usually no middling opinion about this film.  Either you love it or hate it.  This is probably a flim that might hold more appeal for the most diehard Altman fans and those who appreciate experimentation in film.  There really isn't a story per se but more like a collection of images and characters.  The entire film feels like one big strange dream.  Altman admitted to writing this on the fly and is typically the case in his films, he encouraged his actors to ad lib much of their dialogue. The desert southwest backdrop is contrasted with Georgia O'Keefe pastel colors and the bizarre demonic and sexual imagery from the paintings of Janice Rule's character.  The bizarre visuals are accentuated by strange and haunting music that never overwhelms the film.  Shelly Duvall's character is funny, goofy, lonely, sad and pathetic--her portrayal steals the movie.  I loved this movie so much and can mostly overlook its biggest shortcoming, the silly and pretentious ending.  Robert Altman was a visionary in film making.  His absence is sorely missed.",1429747200,5,1159,5.015706806282722

1998122,5,B0001GH5TW,"Next to ""Brewster McCloud"" this has to rank as one of director Robert Altman's quirkiest films.  It starts off in realistic enough fashion as we are introduced to Pinky (Sissy Spacek), a withdrawn woman-child, and Millie (Shelley Duvall), a woman who fancies herself as cultivated but garners all her social etiquette tips from women's periodicals.  Both work at a home for the elderly in a desert town in California.  They bond because they are both essentially lonely as opposed to any shared traits.  The first part of the film devotes itself in seriocomic fashion to this odd coupling but then veers into the near tragic as Pinky attempts suicide and lapses into a coma.  When she emerges from the coma she has a complete personality change.  The connecting thread in the film is the third women, Willie (Janice Rule), a silent artist in the latter stages of pregnancy who paints strange images at the apartment complex  they all reside in.  The denouement is a surreal and dreamlike.  My questions are what part of the film is a dream, if it is a dream, and who's dream is it?  I left this film as much perplexed as drawn to it.  My inclination is not to dismiss this film but find out more.  Altman is alleged to have concocted this film as a dream and brought it to Fox with no script and just a germ of an idea.  Strangely enough the studio greenlighted it due to Altman's track record with ""M*A*S*H"" and ""Nashville"".  The Criterion edition offers a commentary from Altman, which I haven't heard yet, but I have my doubts the auteur will reveal anything of substance allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions. This film is another example as to why the Seventies were a great time for adventurous filmgoers. I would be remiss without mentioning that what drives the film are the performances none more than Shelley Duvall's.  Her character is difficult to play and without being too broad or clich Duvall invests Millie with the proper amount of humanity to gain the empathy of the audience.  I believe Duvall was honored at Cannes for her performance but in typical fashion wasn't nominated for an Oscar.",1420329600,2,2123,4.712737127371274
1998123,2,B0001GH5TW,"I had high hopes for this film because I heard Robert Altman is a supremely well-reviewed and respected director. And I love women as strong central characters so I was convinced by the title! But the story just was not interesting to me. The characters seemed non-sensical and the story was confusing rather than riveting. Imagine my surprise when I read critics reviews after to say how great a film it was! What's strange is that I love filmmaking for all its nuances but for some reason, this film was just a whole 2 hrs of confusion and annoyance. I can see some strong artistic decisions he made but overall, very jaded by this film.",1419292800,2,639,4.565217391304348
1998124,5,B0001GH5TW,"I enjoy movies, but I'm not one to keep watching the same ones over and over. 3 Women is a different story. I first saw it seven years ago, checking it out of the library on a whim. I loved the first part, was weirded out by the second, and the very end left me going ""huh?"". A few weeks ago, I decided to watch 3 Women for a second time. I read reviews written at the time of its release, so that I could better understand some of the things I may have not understood the first time. For example, I did not realize the setting was important to the story, not the rehab where Pinky and Millie work, but the desert town where they live. Roger Ebert, in an early review, describes 3 Women as ""on the one hand, a straightforward portrait of life in a godforsaken California desert community, and on the other, a mysterious exploration of human personalities.""

Because, yes, it really is a godforsaken desert community! Especially the tavern Millie frequents.

Second, yes, the movie makes you think about personalities. And not just Millie's and Pinky's, although they are the main characters. You will wonder about identical twins Peggy and Polly: Why do they keep to themselves? Why does Alcira tell Pinky that the other assistants don't like the twins? You will consider the friendliness of Alicra and Doris, who invite Millie to join them for lunch even though she always eats with the doctors at the hospital across the street? And there's Tom, one of Millie's crushes who must have tried to let her down easy by telling her he had a cold; he keeps coughing every time he sees her. And the apartment residents who snub Millie don't snub Pinky, even though Pinky is weirder than Millie (in some respects).

Which brings you to Millie. Poor Millie is both pathetic and funny. No one likes her, except Pinky, who took interest in her from the start. You will wonder why Millie doesn't move on from the doctors who ignore her, the singles who make fun of her, etc. Instead, Millie constantly embarrasses herself. For example, when she lunches with the doctors, she talks about the frozen banana pop recipe in McCalls, and how McCalls provides tons of recipes with Rice Krispies. These doctors do not care! To get some attention, she asks a doctor to feel her glands, which he does, but not to her liking. This is Millie's social life. And her professional life isn't much better. She doesn't like her job, she leaves elderly patients alone to go smoke cigarettes. Again, the only one who likes her is Pinky.

Pinky, naive and downright weird, actually has better social skills than Millie. She tries to initiate conversation with one of the twins. She invites Millie to lunch; when she sees Millie being ignored by the doctors, Pinky sits alone at an adjacent table- the girl knows boundaries. When Millie's dinner plans go south, Pinky reminds Millie that they can eat the food they prepared for their guests. Pinky can tell when people don't like someone, as evidenced in the parking lot exchange with the dinner guests; she can even tell that Millie doesn't like her when she reads Millie's diary. But for some reason, Pinky wants to be with Millie, maybe even become Millie. Does she like the challenge? Or does Millie represent the ideal woman to Pinky?

Of course, Pinky is fragile, and she is most fragile when Millie gives her the ultimate insult. Thus begins the second half of the movie. It's a weird, awkward portion, where you're wondering about Pinky. Millie is still Millie, but it's even sadder, like when she ""loses"" her car in the rehab center's parking lot.

The third part, which is only a few minutes, will make sense if you trust your first interpretation. The film leaves everything up to your interpretation. For me, I thought the three women realized their lives were screwed up and decided to create a family out of that screwiness. They are in an isolated desert town, so no one will really pay any attention to this contrived family. The last line will leave you thinking about motivation, ""Do you always have to be so mean to her?""",1417651200,2,4058,4.644846796657381

1998131,4,B0001GH5TW,"Surely one of Robert Altman's stranger films, but oddly engaging and ultimately worthwhile.  Sissy Spacek plays an odd sort of innocent who appears in a desert backwater somewhere near LA, destined it seems to wreak her evil, concealed beneath that veneer of simplicity, on a fellow employee of an old folks' spa of sorts.  Her colleague and victim, played by Shelley Duvall, is herself an odd, social outcast/wannabe of the local losers brigade.  Among said losers is the damaged, pregnant artist played by Janice Rule.  No ""normal"" characters are cited.  You wouldn't believe the details of the plot if I tried to explain them.  Rest assured it is unusual.

1998132,5,B0001GH5TW,"There are a few films that I like to watch on a cold gray cloudy windy Sunday afternoon in November, and this is one of them.  It ranks right up there with ""The Last Picture Show."" I mean if you're gonna live in the Great Lakes at that time of year, you might as well make the best of it, eh?  At least this film takes you to the Coachella Valley (one of the sunniest places on the continent), so at least the bleakness around you is assuaged. I don't get the dream stuff people are talking about.  What dream?  I like to watch and interpret this film as realism - but then again, you'd have to have lived in proximity to dysfunctional people like I have; and secondly, have a craving for fleeing to the SW deserts when the climate up here turns gloomy. In that case, this is a character study and a travelogue.  That's my interpretation.  Dream schmeam.

Shelly Duval and Sissy Spacek do a stellar job of acting in this one, and that makes this film a ""must see"" - if for that reason alone.  Goofy characters are difficult to act out in a realistic, believable manner, but they sure do a good job of it!  This film may be a ""B"" movie and a cult movie - but good acting is good acting, no matter what. They both should have gotten Emmys for their acting in this film.

I appreciate the scenes up and down Dillon Rd (or Varner Rd - not sure which) in the area of Desert Hot Springs with the occasional glimpse of San Jacinto, and many views of the Santa Rosas to the south. They go out of their way to not reveal this as Palm Springs and vicinity - even I notice a lack of that in the scenery.  Good job there.  A resort town wouldn't fit the theme. Go to the Dillon Saloon sometime and tell me that wasn't the place they shot the saloon scenes.

The Lillie character could have been deleted entirely.  Putting a ""Bay area"" character in a desert setting kinda ruins the mood.  But...it was the 1970's so I can see the necessity. Gotta sell tickets.

The end of this film was the part I totally forgot about, and in fact, far as I'm concerned, you can shut the film off five minutes early and go wash dishes (or whatever). No comprende.

Nevertheless - one of my top 5 faves! I like to watch this in the time period referred to above, so I can get off my lazy butt and get motivated to gather up my stuff, pack up the car and get the eff out of here and go soak up the sun for a few months.  And, it works.

As a non-liberal, non-superhung Palm Springs hobo-sexual snowbird (no smartphone) I can entirely relate to Shelly Duval's character; been there, experienced it - in the now almost entirely ""gay"" and partnered, size-obsessed population of Palm Springs where nobody of any interest even goes out to the beergarden anymore.

But I know I really want to watch it as many times as it takes and that I'm going to really enjoy watching it as many times as it takes, and then some.

Identity is as fluid as water and as changeable and ephemeral as the changing tides of fate.

After the accident the Duvall character seems to swap identities with her counterpart who becomes brazen and provocative while Duvall becomes weepy and insecure.

1998142,5,B0001GH5TW,"Robert Altman is one of eight or ten directors who can truly be called avant-garde. This is not to say that he was the most obscure, because we know that's not true. It is simply to point out the fact that he was able to create a singular filmic language of his own. What exactly does that mean? Well, it means that by the time the seventies rolled around, Altman had eased into a style that was free of literary antecedent. He was looking to Fellini, to Antonioni, and of course to Bertolucci's Last Tango In Paris, a film which he immediately adored. He was looking for moving images that cohered in a way so as to distinguish themselves from novels. He was skeptical of the written word as some sort of gospel. If you listen closely to Altman's brilliant commentary on the criterion disc, you will find his words very similar to those of Maya Deren decades earlier. Majorly different artists, I would agree, but both emphasizing that we can go much further than ninety minute adaptations. And again, a disparate comparison, but Altman's words on the medium are also not dissimilar from Peter Greenaway's.

3 Women is my favorite movie. Not just of Altman's, but period. I love Bergman's Persona, and its influence here is obviously massive. But remnants of the theater are all over that film. Its formality, in style and gesture, in monologue and melodramatic turn, dominates (and of course we Bergman fans love these trademarks). Beyond the initial similarities in premise though, Women is the more unhinged of the two films. It is impossibly open, moving in the strangest rhythms, drifting where Bergman was exacting. Altman takes the lessons of his previous work, Images in particular, but also the freewheeling California Split and McCabe and Mrs. Miller, and tackles identity transference in sunny, empty Palm Springs. The result is something that unfolds as much like an actual dream as anything else in film. Movement, color (and here it is pastel to the hilt), dust, and an overall feeling of isolation drive it along. It's no stretch to call the film an extended painting, a form Altman felt had the closest kinship to his work.

I have mentioned the author Robert Aickman in a few of my other reviews. Like Altman, he wanted to achieve something of the feeling of poetry with his work, to get beyond narrative constraint. He seemed to believe that no two human beings can ever totally connect, and so the elegiac or inconclusive nature of his tales reflected this. If you look at Millie, Pinky, and Willie in 3 Women a similar notion is explored. Without even beginning to delve into the plot, one certainty is that there is an always expanding failure of communication. Millie and her questions that go unanswered. Pinky and her too innocent demeanor that still ends up spoiling something. And Willie, ever-silent, a trait that will ever be misunderstood.

If you are worried about the storyline cleanly fitting together, about figuring out if this is three phases of a life or three separate lives, I would urge you not to worry. Or to even care. The strangeness, the enigma, exists anyway. Constantly climbing along a double helix of plot possibilities is fun, or makes a good term paper, but the efforts are quickly burned up. This is especially true for Women, which is one of the few films based on an actual dream. Do your dreams consult screenplay textbooks or do they shift to unknown rooms without your knowing why? If it's the former, your dreams are much more academic than mine. At some point we just have to accept and delight in the mystery, the incompleteness of things.",1358640000,4,3599,4.773675762439807

1998145,3,B0001GH5TW,"I'll admit it; I almost couldn't get through 3 WOMEN.  When I reached a point where I was sure it was 90 minutes into the film, I put it on pause, and saw that I had only seen 45 minutes.  It is monumentally slow-moving.  It is also intensely creepy, and after that initial 45 minutes or so, it began to work on me.  Not in an altogether pleasant way, but it was very effective nonetheless.

3 WOMEN introduces us to mostly to 2 women.  We meet Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek, only a year after CARRIE), a new nurse coming to work at a strange, dusty, underpopulated Southern California town in an old-folks convalescence home of some sort.  There she meets Millie (Shelly Duvall), an experienced nurse assigned to show her the ropes.  Pinky is delighted to be attached to Millie, because she has clearly taken a deep and intense interest in Millie.  Millie talks almost non-stop and we see early on that she has alienated almost everyone around her with her incessant chatter and her self-delusion.  She fancies herself a bit of party animal, a gal-about-town.  In fact, everyone avoids her and all of the ""dates"" she thinks she might have never materialize.  She's one of these people (we've all met them) who we feel sorry for, yet are so irritating to be around, we just hope someone else will befriend them.  Pinky, however, sees none of that.  She's from a small Texas town and is so deeply nave that she clings to the ""worldly"" Millie and idolizes her.  And slowly, she begins to obsess over her.  And she pries into Millie's private life.

This doesn't sound all that interesting, and in many ways, it isn't.  But writer/director Robert Altman is taking these two ladies on a strange psychological journey.  What I've described is just the beginning.  I don't want to tell you more, because it's all a bit open to interpretation, and if you decide to take the sometimes grueling journey that is 3 WOMEN, you should interpret for yourself.  But one easy, even glib, description that comes to mind is to call the film an ""artsy SINGLE WHITE FEMALE.""

The film is full of Altman touches, particularly the improvised style of dialogue and the overlapping conversations.  It is in these overlapping voices that we hear the mockery which most people shower directly on Millie.  Millie is so eager for acceptance, to have even a hint that the life she imagines for herself is true, that she willingly endures derision in the hope of breaking through.  I have to admit that I've never been a huge Shelley Duvall fan, but this is the best performance I've seen by her.  She manages, at various times, to be touching, sad, laughable, irritating, competent, crazy.  Altman often gives his female stars some really meaty roles to chew on, and he really did here.  Spacek is also quite captivating.  It's amazing she was ever able to break out of the crazy, nave girl role after this film and CARRIE.  She fits it to a tee...but as the film progresses, Pinky's character undergoes some unexpected transformations, and Spacek handles it all with ease.

I watched the Criterion Blu-Ray, and the picture quality was excellent.  Filmed in the late `70s, the film has that unmistakable look of that era...a color palette that wants to be gritty and realistic and still retain some of the richness of Technicolor.  The Blu-ray gets all that perfectly.  The sound mix was excellent, but I have to say that the score for this film was literally the most annoying ever.  I know that's not much of a useful comment, but I think my ears are still ringing from being stabbed by those awful sounds.  The extras on the Blu-ray are a little skimpy, in my opinion, especially for a relatively modern film.  There's a sparse commentary from Altman (which I only listened to pieces of), a brief essay that sheds little light on the film, and some trailers & stills.  I would have LOVED to have heard a commentary from Duvall & Spacek.

It's hard to recommend this film.  It moves slowly and it's very internalized.  But a viewer with some patience may find some creepy rewards in watching the relationship between these two women (in two really fine performances) grow in unexpected and disquieting ways.",1343520000,3,4175,4.695592286501378
1998146,5,B0001GH5TW,"The seventies and the eighties were incredibly fruitful for director Robert Altman. After the success of `MASH', he was given carte blanche by Twentieth Century Fox. As a result of this wealth of freedom, he wrote, produced, and directed `3 Woman', which, according to the director, was born entirely out of a dream that he had while his wife was in the hospital.

`3 Women' is Altman's masterpiece - ethereal, surreal, and carried by two magnificent performances from Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek. Bearing similarities to Bergman's `Persona' and Lynch's `Mulholland Drive', `3 Women' is the tale of two twenty-something's, Millie Lammoreaux (Duvall) and Pinky Rose (Spacek) who meet one another at the geriatric spa in California where they both work. Pinky is young, nave, and oddly smitten with the high-strung, wannabe socialite that is Millie, who awkwardly takes Pinky under her wing during her job training sessions at the spa. Pinky seems to idolize Millie, who never seems to stop talking. She constantly chatters in the locker room to the other nurses, who never seem to acknowledge her in any way. Despite the indifference of her co-workers, Millie displays an eerie self-confidence, wearing her delusions on her sleeve for the world to see.

When Pinky responds to a roommate request posted by Millie in the hospital cafeteria, the two women find themselves living together, despite their incredibly diverse personalities. The apartment building in which they live is haunted by the presence of a third woman, Willie (Janice Rule) an abstract artist who paints increasingly disturbing murals on the pool floor, featuring dominant, reptilian creatures. Willie is pregnant and never speaks. Her alcoholic husband runs the hotel, as well as the local bar. He constantly flirts with Pinky, and carries on an affair with Millie.

Before long, Pinky's childlike behavior, as well as her inability to mind her own business begins to wear on Millie. The two have a heated argument, after which Pinky jumps from the top of the apartment building into the pool, falling into a coma as a result of the impact. She is admitted to the hospital, much to the shock of Millie, who instantly regrets her dismissive attitudes towards the young lady.

When Pinky finally rises from her coma and moves back in with Millie, it is clear that a personality shift has occurred. Pinky is aggressive, intolerant of Millie's eccentricities, and becomes increasingly promiscuous with Willie's husband. The roles have been inexplicably reversed. Pinky has become everything that Millie aspires to be; only Pinky is better at it. Millie's true colors began to shine through the faade, revealing her vulnerability.

The film ends on an ambiguous note, which completely blurs the line between dream and reality. The entire film is a dreamlike experience - a summer nightmare, rich with symbolism and disturbing imagery. The possibilities are endless with a film such as this, which focuses primarily on mood. You ""feel"" your way through this film, and perhaps this is the proper way to approach such material.

1998155,5,B0001GH5TW,"After watching the film a few times and enjoying the strangeness and ambiguity, it finally clicked as to why I enjoy the film so much. It's about something quite universal and offers a fresh insight into something that is an integral part of our culture: Motherhood.

If you haven't seen the film, stop reading. If you've seen it, bear with me. Many people have talked about the 'personality swap' that takes place between Pinky and Millie. That never rang true to me. They certainly don't swap personalities, although Pinky exhibits a new personality after she jumps into the pool.

This film is simply about what a mother experiences as her daughter grows into a woman. And so many details and moments in the film say volumes about the painful realizations and feelings that many mothers go through, feelings that have never been dramatized as creatively as Altman has done here. For this reason alone, this film is a gift.

Millie is introduced as a bit directionless, always trying to fit in, but never garnering the attention, respect or love she longs for. He coworkers ignore her rants, her neighbors dismiss her, and her former roommate blows her off. But along comes Pinky, strangely childlike considering her apparent age. She is simply the daughter that enters this lonely woman's life. Not literally, but none-the-less, the relationship proceeds this way. Millie is suddenly the center of her new daughter's universe. We see Millie blush at the attention and adoration she has never received. Like any mother, Millie is constantly guiding and teaching Pinky the proper protocol for every situation - from what to wear, daily routine, entertaining guests--and Pinky absorbs it like a sponge. For many of us who love the film, there has always been something very relatable about the way they connect, even if it's hard to put your finger on.

But the dynamics shift when Pinky goes through a symbolic puberty (jumping into the pool). Not coincidentally, this shift is set off by Millie's betrayal of the 3rd woman (Willie, symbolically the grandmother in some respects). After coming out of a coma, Pinky is suddenly a sexual being. Watching how Millie reacts to the new Pinky is quite illuminating, considering that most parents experience this surreal process during their life. The mother has to watch her daughter blossom and have it rubbed in her face that she is past her own sexual prime (this is dramatized by the way neighbor Tom gives Pinky the attention Millie never was able to get). The Mother has to see her own bad habits and traits reflected back via her daughter's behavior (Pinky's new smoking habit and garish use of makeup). And most painfully, the mother falls of her perch as center of her daughter's universe. For those of us who appreciate the film, this is the real heart of the watching Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek go through the surreal turns of this story. It is something absolutely universal. Something our parents silently went through as we became new creatures in our blossoming adolescence.

By not presenting Millie and Pinky as literal mother and child, Altman may alienate some less-discerning viewers. But what he achieves is worth it: He presents how surreal and alienating these parts of the parenting process are. It's a mysterious shift in balance of power, in focus of affection, in bond, and it ultimately leads to a disturbing realization... something that can't be expressed in a self-help book or a parenting manual, but it's hauntingly expressed in the still-birth sequence at the end.

The strange coda to the film, which shows the 3 women working at Dodge City with all male interference cast aside, has also baffled viewers. But I would argue that Altman smartly used this ending to provide a key to understanding the film. In this final scene, the women are blatantly portrayed as a family: Willie is cast as the grandmother, Millie as the mother, and Pinky as the daughter. It feels very different in tone than the rest of the movie: more theatrical and symbolic. This coda kept encouraging me to revisit the film and puzzle through its mysteries. Many reviews on this site insist that there is no method to Altman's madness. I would argue that it's an example of his genius. He may not have even defined them exactly as mother/daughter in his mind, but he was certainly interested in portraying truth, and that essential truth has made this a beloved film, even for those who prefer not to dissect it.",1283299200,60,4470,4.882740447957839
1998156,4,B0001GH5TW,"I feel a bit stupid on this one.  Lionized by most critics as a neglected masterpiece, I certainly liked it, and respected it's lofty aims, but didn't flat out love it.  The two lead performances by Sissy Spacek and Shelly Duvall are wonderful, and the film has more than its share of powerful and creepy moments.

But the film - based on a dream of Altman's, and not trying to make any literal sense - feels overly self-conscious and arty at times.  I found the music  intrusive, almost shouting `see how weird this is?' And a lot of the symbolism, like the paintings that run through the film, feels  bit heavy handed and obvious.  Alternately some plot twists feel arbitrary, not thought through.

This is often compared to David Lynch's dream films Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway. But I found both of those a little more fun, and they felt more cohesive in their dream worlds, even if I didn't always know what was going on.

Now, having said all that, I do look forward to seeing it again.  I've often found some of my very favorite films are complex and challenging works that don't jell on 1st viewings, only to have those petty annoyances fall away on a second look.  In any case, if you're up for something challenging, this is a terrifically acted, unique and brave film, and certainly worth a look.  And - since it's a film that plays on subconscious more than literal levels - I suspect no two people will
react to this exactly the same way.",1282003200,4,1456,4.515267175572519
1998157,5,B0001GH5TW,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's closeness to Bergman's ""Persona"" is strongly felt,though both films are very individual pieces of art of two very different artists. It's a movie that leaves you thinking about it long after you finished watching it. One of it's strongest sides is a wonderful music that comes back to my mind every time I think about the film's disturbing images. The acting is excellent,especially by Spacek and Duvall and the operator's work is gorgeous.
The film is about two common,mediocre,untalented(one is Millie,pretentious and pathetic and another one,Pinky,a grown-up infant who needs constant support and care)young women doing simple jobs in the Old Men's House(this is what they know and can do)and much older,quiet,reclusive but gifted artist Willie who paints beautiful murals describing strange male and female creatures in violent and sexual acts. I think these paintings are the key to understanding what kind of psychological relations Willie has with the outer world. This explains her reclusiveness and almost total silence during the film,giving preference to her wordless expression in an artful manner of her inner state and attitude towards the world. Actually this silent woman fells as a victim to the three other main characters - first losing her unfaithful,hard drinking friend-husband(?) Edgar as both Millie and then ""new"" Pinky in turn sleep with him(though both know very well that Willie is expecting a child)and then her baby when Pinky having been sent to call a doctor,just watches indifferently(this indifference is especially strongly felt after the Millie's ""bloody"" slap) as Millie is hoplessly trying to help Willie and finally fails. The ultimate expression of this unbearable cruelty of being is the dead-born baby,who ""refuses to be born alive"" into such a world. The end is open to interpretations:it may be easy to understand why Edgar could have been killed by Willie(though it is never revealed who did it),but it would be strange to discover that it is Pinky and Millie who actually did it(NOBODY FORCED them to sleep with Edgar and cause pain to Willie!). Love,depression,envy(What does Pinky think when she watches Willie painting?),psychological violence and hidden hatred are all interrelated in this superb human drama of an exceptionally talented film director.

No, on second thought it's not BEYOND me, it's BENEATH me. I get what he was trying to do, but it's heavy handed and poorly executed.

1998160,4,B0001GH5TW,"Three Women was another Robert Altman masterpiece. His films have always deeply explored the frailties, of the human personality. And Three Women is typical of Altman's deftness, regarding intense characterizations.

This film takes place in the late 70s, in a remote California town. It revolves around three very different female characters, and the effects that each of them has on each other's lives.

Shelley Duvall is cast as Millie. Millie is an intensely garrulous woman. She's obsessed with talking about recipes, that she garners from women's magazines. She annoys those around her, with her constant chatter about her 'latest recipe'.

Millie also desperately wants to impress her male acquaintances. Men seem to mostly shun Millie though, which doesn't stop her from trying to gain their attention.

Millie has a dead-end job, working as a nurse's aid in a nursing home. Her supervisors are brusque, and unsympathetic. She tries to be friendly and helpful, but this often causes her more problems with her bosses.

Pinky (played by the very talented Sissy Spacek) moves to Millie's town. She needs a job and is hired as a nurse's aid, at the same nursing home that Millie works at. Millie is assigned to train Pinky in her new job duties. Pinky soon becomes quite attached to Millie.

Finally, Millie has someone around (Pinky), who actually admires her. When Millie posts a notice on the bulletin board at work , indicating that she seeks a roommate, Pinky is only to happy to get the chance to room with Millie. Pinky then moves into Millie's apartment. Though Millie's apartment has a tacky, garish quality, Pinky expresses how sublime she thinks it is.

One afternoon after work, Millie asks Pinky to go with her to a run-down bar. Pinky meets Millie's friend Edgar, who has set-up a shooting rink out back. He constantly practices shooting there, and invites Millie and Pinky to participate. Edgar is a sophomoric, macho-type, who drinks heavily. He also likes to show-off his marksmanship skills.

Millie also introduces Pinky to Willie, who happens to be Edgar's artist girlfriend. Willie is always painting monstrous, sexually explicit creatures around the bar. Pinky is, inexplicably, mesmerized by Willie's offbeat paintings.

Willie has a haunting, remote presence. She mostly watches everyone else from afar, while being intensely involved with her artwork. Willie also happens to live in the same apartment building, as Millie and Pinky. Her disturbing paintings, adorn the bottom of the swimming pool located there.

Basically, the film doesn't have much of a plot. At least not in the traditional, linear manner that audiences are accustomed to. Instead, Altman chose to focus on the psychological aspects of the relationship between the three woman, and how this changes over time.

The friendship between Pinky and Millie becomes tumultuous, for no obvious reason. Willie is the ethereal, mysterious woman of the three. She doesn't interact much with Millie and Pinky throughout the film. Willie's artwork is so hypnotic to Pinky though, that it has a horrible effect on Pinky's psyche, resulting in tragic consequences. The viewer is left to try and fathom why.

All three women in the film, are social misfits. And they each struggle pathetically to function in the alienating, urban environment that they inhabit. Altman did a marvelous job, highlighting the emotional turmoil that the women inflict on each other, during the course of the film.

This is a film that will leave a deep impression, regarding the dynamics of women's friendships in modern life. But don't expect a neat and tidy conclusion, to the conflicts between the three women.

Milly and Pinky end up becoming roommates. I liked how hard Milly tries to be social and to fit in with the crowd but she just doesnt. Milly takes forever in the bathroom and likes to cook. Pinky tends to get bossed around by Milly - running after her like a puppy at times. Then Pinky gets head trauma and takes over Milly's personality. There's also random shots of this pregnant woman sand painting the pool. She's the 3rd woman.

1998163,2,B0001GH5TW,"Robert Altman's 1977 film 3 Women, which he wrote and directed from a dream he had, is not a bad film, but not a great film either. It is one of those films, ala Robert Browning, whose reach exceeds its grasp, but not in the good way. It is intended to work on a dream level, yet it is too realistic in its detail for much of the film to be seen as all dream, and not quite bizarre enough to be real dream, especially in its far too forced, and ultimately failed, ending.

Some critics have likened the film to Ingmar Bergman's Persona, but this is a stretch. Even though that film is a bit overrated in the Bergman canon, 3 Women is nowhere in that league as a work of art: not as film, social commentary, nor work of symbolism. It has some elements in common with Roman Polanski's Repulsion, about another female misfit on the verge of insanity, as well as to the later, and far inferior, David Lynch mystery film Mulholland Drive, which was also about two women in a dreamy scenario.

The film follows the life of two lonely women who can only be called 'losers'. Millie Lammoreaux (Shelley Duvall) is an ugly worker at a California old folks' health spa. She is unpopular, shunned by her co-workers- who ignore her blather despite her not realizing it, yet lives in a world of her own making, where all people like her, she is among the popular set, and life is made better by magazine ads and cooking recipes that involve all pre-processed foods and no real cooking ability. She is so clueless that every time she drives her mustard colored heap of a car her yellow skirt always gets caught in the door, and hangs outside. She also wears hideous yellow bathrobes with hoods to her apartment complex's pool, yet thinks all the men desire her.

She becomes co-workers and roommates ($55 a month- those were the days!) with an even odder girl who comes to work at the spa, one day, and seems to lack a past, even though she claims to be from Texas, like Millie. Her name is also Mildred, although she goes by the nickname Pinky Rose (Sissy Spacek). Pinky is a redhead who seems almost autistic (as she would be labeled these days), and is even less capable of existing in the world....The third woman of the film is an older woman, Willie Hart (Janice Rule), who is pregnant, cold, silent, and paints bizarre man-hating pictures of pregnant gargoyle-like creatures on tiles and in pools, that seem to betray her bitterness, especially toward her no account husband, Edgar (Robert Fortier), a buffoonish would be macho man, and ex-stunt double in Western films, who is as big a joke to his sex as the two girls are to theirs, due to his penchant for guns, motorcycles, and beer. The two of them own the apartment complex, The Purple Sage- a sort of pre-Melrose Place Melrose Place for losers, the two girls share an apartment in, and also own a crappy bar, Dodge City, out in the desert, where macho loses race dirt bikes...Then, Altman tanks the film with wan surrealism that fails...It is best described as that misfit beast- 'the noble failure.' Robert Altman has always been a hit and miss director....and, unlike Michelangelo Antonioni's best films, which often seem to end not at their chronological ends, this film's ending is not the work of a carefully placed artist's inventiveness, just stylized randomness rationalized after the fact.",1220486400,11,3347,4.6124161073825505

1998165,4,B0001GH5TW,"3 WOMEN is one strange movie.  From the first shots of elderly people with flesh that is both flabby and withered slowly moving in a therapy pool with their attendants the viewer knows that this is not a typical Hollywood offering.  Set somewhere in the Palm Springs vicinity the action moves mostly between three specific places - the therapy center where two of the women work, a Western bar called ""Dodge City""  and an apartment complex, ""The Purple Sage"".  The film does have a definite plot but that plot is wide open to interpretation.

The three women are Millie, Pinky (who claims her real name is  Mildred but is she reliable?) and the pregnant and nearly silent Willie.  Millie is played brilliantly by Shelley Duvall.  A clueless loser who tries too hard and never stops talking, Millie, works at the therapy center, lives at ""The Purple Sage"" and hangs out at the ""Dodge City"" bar where for all her talk of boyfriends and dates her only lover seems to be Edgar, Willie's  middle aged, ex Hollywood cowboy husband who owns both the bar and Millie's apartment complex.  Willie is played by Janice Rule as a strange beautiful woman who seems almost too old to be pregnant and floats through the movie mostly silent, painting weird scenes. Sissy Spacek's Pinky seems childlike and naive when we meet her and also when we last see her in the haunting closing scenes.  She comes to work at the therapy center pool and is invited to become fellow Texan Millie's roommate.  Pinky is perhaps the most enigmatic of all the characters in this very quirky film as we don't know whether to see her as an innocent or a master manipulator.  A visit from an elderly couple who claim to be her parents raises more questions than it answers.

The entire movie is dreamlike and a long actual dream sequence right before the tragic climax of the film does little to enhance the plot.  The movie is definitely ""out there"" but the fine acting and direction hold the viewer's attention.  This is a great film to watch with others since is raises so many intriguing questions to discuss.",1210291200,4,2075,4.65934065934066
1998166,3,B0001GH5TW,"The dreamiest and most oblique of Robert Altman's '70s classics (granting that IMAGES and QUINTET cannot plausibly be deemed ""classics""), 3 WOMEN is a compellingly weird bit of self-indulgence from the deepest recesses of Altman's brain.  In fact the director has revealed that the genesis of this movie was an actual dream he had, and it shows in the movie's atmospheric visuals, deliberate pacing and aura of mystery.  Ingmar Bergman's PERSONA also seems to be an influence, as this film encroaches on similar territory of two women living together whose identities seem to merge in ambiguous ways.  The pairing of Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall, two of the most unique and odd female presences in '70s cinema, contributes to the offbeat personality of this ""only-in-the-70s"" American art film.  I wouldn't call it one of Altman's best, but it's a fascinating artifact of a period where such compellingly weird bits of self-indulgence were financed and released by the major Hollywood studios.",1208304000,,996,5.20625
1998167,5,B0001GH5TW,"This is one of Robert Altman's best films, a really moody, mystic film, mysterious and complex.  It has an aura about it that isn't typical of most Altman films.  It is more in line with directors like Tarkovsky, Kubrick, and Tarr, in that many things are left unanswered, and there is tons to think and talk about afterwards.  It's not that other Altman films don't make you think (they do), but here the film has a lot of loose ends, and it's almost like a cerebral science fiction film, one in which you're not sure what just happened.  There is no real plot, but something to do with 3 women (played by Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall).  This film was never on any home video format until recently, and it had a reputation of being a lost Altman masterpiece.  The reputation fits.  Thanks to Criterion for bringing this mysterious, deeply poetic film to us.  Altman had a career schock full of brilliant work, but this is one of his most unique films that retains its power even today.",1188864000,2,989,4.51685393258427

1998169,2,B0001GH5TW,"Pinky (Spacek) could have chosen a more interesting person to latch onto than Millie (Duvall).
Pinky insinuates herself very carefully, and quickly, into the life of Millie, an exceedingly pathetic loser who doesn't even realize that she is mocked and avoided by the people around her.

Based on the other reviews here, I am completely in the minority because I really didn't like this movie very much. ""3 Women"" starts like a quirky character piece, then it eventually turns sinister, and ends flat and confusing. There is absolutely no payoff here, even though some seeds of genuine possibility and menace are planted and begin to spread.
People say that this is ambivalent and dreamlike. Well, there's entirely too much ambivalence here: Who really is Pinky (Spacek)? What's her story? Why is she so interested in Millie, a stranger? Who are we supposed to care about? Why is it called 3 Women if it only really deals with two? And why are the scenes of Willie the pregnant mural painter laced with loud, sinister background music? It's beyond me. And annoying. This movie just offers endless questions.

I hoped for (and truly expected) something better to develop, based on the slow and palpable tension that Altman builds over two hours. There's a lot of potential here but it's never explored. We are left with some bizarre, questionable stuff instead, like Altman slowly and methodically zooming in on a can of dessert topping spray while the characters chat. What was that about? Probably nothing. It's all apparently open to interpretation... every single bit of it. I'll pass.

The interesting thing for me is that this might've made an amazing psychological horror film, had they added some suspense and chills. It already has the creepy psycho and the claustrophobic setting. It could have been a worthy addition to '70s thrillers like Play Misty for Me, Deliverance, The Stepford Wives, and The Beguiled.",1184112000,5,1918,5.006269592476489

Altman, who based his script on an actual dream, focuses heavily on atmosphere and symbolic visual imagery, but he allows his actors--especially Duvall, as the pathologically chattering Millie--plenty of room to unravel their weird Southern personas. Vague, provocative, and awash in lensman Charles Rosher's hazy blue-and-yellow palette, ""3 Women"" is a bewitching tale of naivet and emotional distress.",1183420800,,633,5.74468085106383

1998172,4,B0001GH5TW,"I've wanted to see Robert Altman's ""3 Women""(1977) for long time and finally saw it last night. The references to one of my all time favorites, Ingmar Bergman's ""Persona"" are obvious: two young women, the main characters (seemingly meek, childlike Pinky and outgoing and seemingly popular but in reality a sad loser Millie seem almost to exchange identities, or to become one in a desperate search for connection and sense of belonging but ""3 Women"" is memorable and haunting on its own terms. It makes you think long time after it's over. As a matter of fact, I am still thinking about it. I think that it is an incredible work of an extraordinary master. As always in his best films, Robert Altman is terrific - innovative, iconoclastic, free-spirited, unconventional, and truly original. He is a great humanist who sees through his characters but never makes fun of them and he understands them. Under his directing, Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacec gave two astonishing performances. They were both great but Duvall was a revelation. She adapted the loquacious Millie's personality and become the character. Altman had discovered Duvall at one of the malls in Texas where she was selling cosmetics and given her roles in his six films. I want also to mention the eerie music, the dreamy and uneasy atmosphere of something sinister ready to happen, the scary and mesmerizing murals on the bottom of the pool that the third woman, silent and mysterious, tired and wise Willie (Janice Rule) was painting. Altman did not try to trick or confuse me, and the story seems to be simple one but I am not sure that I understood everything, especially the enigmatic ending. Altman was aware of the effect of his movie to the viewers and in his commentary he says that he sees the film as a painting and that the audience should feel it but not understand it. In this regard it also reminds of ""Un chien andalou"" (1929) which was supposed to be experienced directly and not analyzed by the viewers.

""3 Women"" is another great film by one of the best American film directors. I've never seen a bad film from Robert Altman.

1998173,4,B0001GH5TW,"Since Robert Altman's recent passing, I've made it my mission to see all of his films. I've seen about 13 so far ... and this one was the most unexpected surprise yet. A great film! But not action-packed by any means.

This is a thriller in the mold of 40s-era Hitchcock or Polanski's ""Repulsion"" -- with touches of Bergman, the Twilight Zone and David Lynch throughout. [Lynch must have watched this film when developing ""Twin Peaks.""] Despite these influence [homages?], it has Robert Altman's fingerprints all over it.

Be patient with this movie. Look in the corners of the frame. Try to absorb the tidbits of conversations. You'll be rewarded with little details in the early stages that have unexpected payoffs later in the film. Having said that, it's a movie you can pay strict attention to and spot clues throughout ... or just let it wash over you like a fever dream.

I could not stop thinking about this movie for days. I want to let some time pass before watching it again, though I definitely will see it multiple times in the future.

A few thoughts:

It seems like nearly every scene has characters looking through or being filmed through glass or water [sometimes both]. Reflections off water, mirrors or windows occur frequently, and often reveal hidden details that move the ""plot"" forward.

And the music! It sets a creepy tone that builds and builds to the perplexing climax. It's unsettling and it's nearly impossible to guess where the plot is leading -- or even who you're supposed to sympathize with. You could even debate who the ""3 Women"" really are.

Altman's personal take is that the last scene in the movie actually takes place right before the first scene in the movie. I've tried to get a handle on that theory, and must respectfully disagree with the creator!

But he is the first to say no interpretation is wrong or right. Like a recurring dream, the film is meant to endlessly circle back on itself. Give this one a chance. It will haunt you if you let it.",1166659200,4,1993,4.6581196581196584
1998174,5,B0001GH5TW,"Robert Altman's THREE WOMEN is a fascinating character study of a number of oddballs living in a slow-paced southwestern town.  Millie (Shelly Duval) is a chatty, delusional nursing home attendant whose perception of her own social skills and sexual attractiveness is considerably inflated; Pinky (Sissy Spacek) is a shy, introverted newcomer who finds employment at the same facility at which Millie works, and who becomes obsessed with her new coworker; Willie (Janice Rule) is a pregnant, somewhat bohemian character who speaks very little, and who paints odd reptilian murals at the bottom of the swimming pool at the apartment complex she and her husband manage (where Millie lives and which Pinky later also moves into); Edgar is Willie's filandering, macho, somewhat sinister appearing husband, whose claim to fame is that had appeared on the old ""Wyatt Earp"" TV series.

Though the film moves very slowly, and offers little in the way of plot ""action"", it remains intensely compelling due to Altman's nuanced characters and intentionally vague, dream-like quality.  Spacek and Duval's performances are magnificent, and special mention should also be made of Rule, who had very little dialogue, yet who managed to create a memorable, fascinating character through her mostly non-verbal acting.

Definitely not a film for fans of car chases or those who like every little thing explicitly spelled out, but for those who like to draw their own conclusions, thos remains a very rewarding film to watch.",1164067200,,1506,5.2887029288702925
1998175,5,B0001GH5TW,"Director Robert Altman says he literally dreamed up the idea of this film during a low point in his life, when he'd just lost a project with the studio and his wife had fallen seriously ill. Set in the desert near Palm Springs, the film concerns itself with a 1970s version of identity theft, as a young woman befriends a new employee at a hot springs spa where they work as attendants for its elderly clientele. Both of them from Texas, with the same first names, they exist in an unfriendly social environment as harsh, distant, and unforgiving as the surrounding desert. The third woman of the title is the wife of a philandering, self-described movie stunt-double. She is a haunting presence, painting strange figures on the underwater surfaces of swimming pools, completely silent until the final scenes of the film.

The two-hour film moves at an almost lethargic pace, appropriate for lives lived in the heat of the desert sun. Isolated and lonely, the two main characters are undeveloped and incomplete in ways that materialize as the film progresses. As in Bergman's ""Persona,"" identities become mysteriously insubstantial as internal pressures, like the fierce, angry underwater images at the bottom of the pool, make their presence felt. Eventually, as one crisis follows another, the women merge and refigure themselves as personalities, the camera finally pulling away and away and away at the end from a resolution that is also a puzzlement about the nature of human identity.

The film is visually striking, as it captures the pervasiveness of desert light and makes poetic use of double images, reflections in mirrors, and the appearance of a pair of mysterious twins. The soundtrack is haunting. The performances by Duvall and Spacek are nicely poignant and disturbing. This is without question a 1970s Hollywood film, made at a time when the thought-provoking, adult fare of European directors still held some influence on the creative license of American film producers. The 2003 Criterion edition of this film on DVD includes a commentary by Altman, in which he talks more generally about filmmaking, with occasional reference to ""Three Women"" itself.",1163980800,5,2171,5.112676056338028
1998176,5,B0001GH5TW,"3 Women is one of the most compelling films I've seen in a long while. In some ways it features all of the familiar Altman traits (the quirky characters, the bizarre locations, the off-beat music, and the staggering this way and that storyline that, at times, threatens to dissolve into incoherence) but it also offers something that only a few of Altman's other classics have: moral depth.

I've tried to view all of Altman's seventies films but a few of them remain hard to track down. After many years I finally located California Split (recently released on DVD) and Thieves Like Us (still only available on VHS) but my favorite two Altman films are McCabe and Mrs. Miller (DVD) and The Long Goodbye (DVD). At least these two were my favorites before I viewed the most difficult to track down of all Altman films, 3 Women. Now its availbale on DVD but for years the only way you could see it was on late-night cable or in a New York art house revival of old Altman films.  Nothing against 80's and 90's Altman but 70's Altman is where cinema begins and ends for anyone who grew up in that decade because Altman puts his finger right on something that no one even seems to see: that characters are always mysteriously disconnected from their surroundings, and that pop culture leaves its inhabitants curiously marooned in an artificial world and starved for connection to something real.

Altman has an uncanny knack for picking remote locations that simply re-inforce the feeling that each character is alone and buttressed by nothing but their own ingenuity. Whether its the beach house in Long Goodbye (which was Altmans own home at the time) or the rural suburbia of 3 Women these locations seem like utopian California dreamscapes that can with the bat of an eye turn into frightfully arid zones of psychic disintegration.

Altman was a painter for a time and though I am not aware of which painters he preferred I imagine he was influenced by the Bay Area figuritive artists like Diebenkorn whose Ocean Park series captures at once the lustre and menace of living in an enternally sunny oasis.

3 Women is frightening. Sissy Spacek is perhaps the most effective actress in recent cinema to make vacuity and emptiness seem so frightening. Shelly Duvall is equally good at conveying vacuity and emptiness but she fills her character ""Millie's"" void with an endless flow of words that at least provide her with the illusion that she is a coherent and functioning whole, thus rendering herself less vulnerable to the dissolution that Spacek's ""Pinky"" is powerless to ward off.

3 Women is best viewed with little foreknowledge of the story so I will not elaborate beyond that as to the psychic unraveling of these two.  Suffice it to say that these two work in a kind of spa for the elderly. Its a location as bleak as the desert that surrounds it and equally void of emotion and character; the spa is run by the book and there is no room for anyone to show any individuality or to connect with others in any way but through professional roles and channels. Therefore Shelly Duvall's chattering is a constant earsore to her superiors, though to Sissy Spacek her chattering is like the one bit of proof that the spa does in fact have a pulse and that life does in fact exist.

The other two locations that figure prominently are the apartment complex (replete with seventies singles parties)and the desert bar where Millie and Pinky meet Willie, a highly eccentric artist-barkeep who expresses herself only visually. Her mosaics that decorate strangely unseen places like the unvisited and unseen oasis of a private pool bottom in the middle of nowhere are of haunting vengeful figures; the figures look Etruscan or Greek and they seem to forewarn of terrible things like the things in Greek tragedies.

The psyches in this film are each like unseen and unvisted oasis. We know next to nothing about the talkative Millie, the reticent wallflower Pinky, and the decidedly silent but intense and resentful Willie.  All three do share one thing: they are women.

I urge Altman fans to view this, but also fans of Bergman's Persona, and DePalma's Sisters, and Polanski's Repulsion and fans of French directors like Claude Chabrol. This is an artsy (though in no way pretensious) film and not one you will ever fully cognitively master because it works at a level that defies rational, linear description.

Nashville is undoubtedly Altman's big budget masterpiece, but I think this one (now that people are able to finally view it) is becoming known as Altman's low-budget seventies masterpiece.

A film you will watch more than once, but I envy those of you who haven't seen it because the first viewing is the strangest. An absolutely singular experience.",1153267200,27,4756,4.813725490196078

The weird, atonal score by Gerald Busby was an annoyance throughout, often drowning out the dialog. It's the kind of creepy music that comes in most horror movies just before the space aliens are going to appear, or in a psychological thriller, just as the nutcase is transforming into a psycho. Only in this film, the creepy music played on and on. That was it. No nuances, no alteration, no variance, no imagination. Just the same creepy atonal 'psycho' music all the time.

Duvall and Spacek did a good job but the writing and directing were abysmal. Lots of shots where the camera stays on the actor for a loooong time, and dream-like sequences, conveying... mystery? suspense? drama what? Ah..I got it, they convey CONFUSION! That's it! The writer/director was confused!

1998183,5,B0001GH5TW,"There are two types of film in the world: those you figure out, and those that take you along in directions you cannot understand initially.  This, of course, is the latter (else I wouldn't be mentioning it), a film in which the viewer is not worthy of the first watch and certainly requires a second.

Based on the director's dream, 3 Women is a film about multiple identities and Primal Scene.  Two women, played perfectly by Shelly Duvall and Sissy Spacek, struggle desperately for identity while a third, played by Janice Rule, entangles their imaginations with her primal and haunting art.  As the women's personalities grow closer and simultaneously conflict with each other's developing personalities, the loud and noisy world of men begins to lose its necessity for their existence, and they begin to violently reject it, only in the most subconcious way.

This is a film for symbolism.  Colors, water, desert, advertising, everything is used for multiple, layered effect.  Nothing is supposed to be taken merely by face value, and indeed it can't, because afterall, the haunting rhythm of the soundtrack will keep the viewer's heart racing even when it seems nothing particularly sinister is on the screen.

Definitely a film for people who get into weird, abstract cinema and deep, didactic exposition.

1998184,5,B0001GH5TW,"The film's plot is filled with twisted, violent images of the harsh desert landscape setting and the artist's (Janice Rule) writhing paintings on the bottom of the swimming pool.  The film's characters are rootless, lonely people seemingly swept up to this miserable place because they have nowhere else to go and they bond together because they have nobody else to turn to. Spacek's Pinky latches onto Duvall's Millie not just to be her friend but to be her. Dominance in relationships flies back and forth but finally comes to land perfectly in an ending where all the plot pieces come to a satisfying resolution. In my view, the film is a classic work of art. It was a treasure to find it on Amazon.",1123027200,2,702,4.661290322580645
1998185,5,B0001GH5TW,"This film is top-notch description of the female universe. Possibly if you check all the previous American Filmography until this film you would surely have to build a bridge and wait for The Hours to close the cycle.

Altman made a mesmerizing picture, with crucial shots and visual clues; the dragon in the bottom of the swimming pool, for instance.

If you remind two stunning films of Ingmar Bergman (Persona and Cries and whispers), you feel this film is extremely linked in what spirit concerns to both of them.

Altman made to my mind his most introspective work, and once more he had that special eye to find Spacek and Duvall two excellent actress for that moment.(Remember that Shelley Duvall is the wife of Nicholson in The Shinning).

In this order of ideas I recomend you watch this film free of any other problem. It is not an easy going film. It will demand from you all the pssible attention and commitment.

Go for this curiously little known chamber piece of Altman who after his recent succesful film Nashville (1975), a broad audience seem forget.",1119398400,,1067,4.745945945945946
1998186,5,B0001GH5TW,"Yes, 3 Women is pretentious. Yes, it is almost plot free. Yes, it was a total flop. And, yes, it is oblique, dream-like and sometimes difficult to watch.

But it remains a unique movie, with a poetic sensibility (and considerable black humour) that puts most of contemporary cinema absolutely to shame. It is a testament to what happens when you give a group of real artists some money, and free rein to reinvent a world view in expressive and intriguing ways.

It comes as close as any Altman movie ever did to illustrating why he is a great director of actors. The general line on Altman is that his masterpieces are ""Nashville"", or ""Thieves Like Us"", or perhaps ""McCabe and Mrs Miller"". But I suspect this is the one that was the closest to his artistic core. I know it haunted me for years, and I only saw it once.

I recognise that Altman has produced some complete tosh over the years (eg ""Quintet"", ""Pret-a-Porter""), but to this day he has never received the credit he deserves for that incredible period in the early seventies when he just grasped the creative nettle with both hands, used everything and everybody the studios could give him, and produced some of the most compelling movies of the age. This was one of them.

Finally ridding himself almost completely this time of that always pesky narative albatross called plot, Altman seemingly bites off more than he can possibly chew, but I'll be damned if he doesn't get just about every bit digested. The hypnotic acting and mis-en-scene steer this cinematic poem down streets and alleys that I wasn't quite expecting from a Robert Altman film,who admittedly has always been consistently hit-or-miss in terms of quality. The almost ethereal tone that Altman strikes here seems to anticipate the more recent work of David Lynch,which makes one wonder why he never continued in this vein.

The acting and camera work are superb and the story is not that difficult to follow if one pays attention and uses his/her imagination. Pinky's attempted suicide is one of the greatest scenes ever filmed by anyone at any time. A little more sexual intimacy between Millie and Pinky would have been appreciated but one can't have everything, and an inside joke is the fact that several of the actors who play attendants at the rest home were at the time appearing on MARY HARTMAN, MARY HARTMAN.

1998190,3,B0001GH5TW,"This 1977 Robert Altman has a lot going for it.  It stars Shelly Duval and Sissy Spacek, with a small part by Janice Rule.  Shelly and Sissy are co-workers in a geriatric rehabilitation center.  Sissy is the new girl in town and is fascinated by Shelly who seems, to her, to have it all together.  Shelly is outgoing and friendly and dresses well. She talks about dating men and recipes and her nice apartment.  Problem is that people don't like Shelly.  They don't listen to her constant chatter.  Men seem to run away from her.  And she has no friends even though she tries hard.

Sissy becomes Shelly's roommate. A lecherous older man and his wife, Janice Rule, own their apartment complex.  The husband beds the ladies.  The wife, who is pregnant, is an artist and doesn't speak at all.  She just paints all day, mostly decorating the bottom of an empty swimming pool in a deserted ""old west"" theme park.

An incident puts Sissy in the hospital and in a coma.  When she recuperates, her whole personality is changed.  The relationship between the women changes too. And then it turned a little weird.  Too bad.  The ending was confusing and depressing.

This film is an excellent showcase for the talented actresses and the director.  I also thought the theme was really interesting. For that reason I do give it a mild recommendation.",1091836800,6,1339,4.669527896995708
1998191,5,B0001GH5TW,"I first encounterd '3 Women' while flipping through the cable channels on a lazy summer day in 1997.  I tuned into the movie right at the scene where Sissy Spacek was screaming at Shelley Duvall from a hospital bed, ""DON'T CALL ME PINKY -- GET OUT OF HERE!""  It was from this moment on that I became fascinated with Robert Altman's dreamlike masterpiece, '3 Women.'  I made sure to tape it during a repeat screening, and for years hoped that it would make it to DVD, for it was never even released on VHS!  So when I heard about Criterion giving it the deluxe treatment, I was very excited.
'3 Women' is not a conventional film by any means.  Every person I invite over to watch it, either loathes it or is so utterly puzzled that they need to have a stiff drink afterwards.  It is not a film that all audiences will appreciate.  However, those with an interest in unusual characters or artsy cinema should find it a rewarding experience, especially with repeated viewings.  It's not so much a matter the film being ahead of it's time -- '3 Women' is in a timespace all of it's own!
The strongest attraction of '3 Women' for me, is the remarkable performances by Shelley Duvall and Sissy Spacek.  Duvall brings a sense of pathos and false reassurance to Millie.  Can't we all think of some Millie-types who we know that try so hard to fit in with society but just fail miserably?  Spacek, on the other hand, gives Pinky an other-worldliness that at times borders on a personality disorder right out of the DSM-IV manual.
Like '2001: A Space Odyssey,' '3 Women' leaves several mysteries unanswered and leaves the viewer to fill in the blanks.  For instance, why was Pinky was warned about the twins early on in the film?  Why did Pinky give Ms. Bunwell Millie's social security number instead of her own?  And of course, what was the inexplicable final scene all about?
Criterion's DVD presention is acceptable.  Robert Altman provides a commentary track which is more than welcome.  There's also some interesting period photos, a teaser trailer, the theatrical trailer and two TV spots.  I would have loved a documentary or some interviews with the cast, but I am quite satisfied with what is presented.
Intriguing but never overbearing, '3 Women' is one of the most interesting and brilliant films of all time.  Watch it with an open mind, and some wine -- perferably Lemon Satin or Tickled Pink, of course.",1084233600,93,2408,4.652482269503546

Thank you Criterion Collection for selecting this classic as one of your children. Nothing prepared me for the Robert Altman commentary that accompanies the film.  I didn't realize how much this film had affected my life and friends life.  I loved Shelley Duvall's Millie but I didn't realize how close to the character I became. The commentary was like a two hour therapy session. They don't make films like this anymore.  Altman called it a impressionistic painting with music.  Wow!  The production is top notch and the mural paintings and the music are erie adding tension to the dramatic nightmare.  Shelley Duvall, Sissy Spacek and Jancie Rule are brilliant.",1083196800,9,786,4.82089552238806
1998193,5,B0001GH5TW,"I remember seeing Altman movies in the 1970's and 1980's.  I loved every one of them.  ""Three Women"" was probably the most extraordinary - not to take anything away from ""The Long Goodbye"" or ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller.""  The other American auteur I remember in the limelight at the time was Paul Mazursky.  I believe Mazursky got an Oscar for ""Harry & Tonto.""  I remember thinking back then that Altman was overdue for the kind of recognition he should have had for his work.  From my point of view, in Mazursky films, the characters were basically conventional and the exterior world was kooky - this crazy world we live in these days.  With Altman films, however, the madness was within each character, against a backdrop of a conventional exterior world.  To me this is more real, more architypal, more universal, more permanent.
In ""Three Women"" the painter lady paints away on murals in a desert swimming pool showing these ancient maybe Egyptian guys who can stand alone in their soulless fortress (if they have to), while the women crawling around their feet cannot (and they aren't too happy about it). There is no road map out of this one, the weather of human existence.
All this would be depressing except that a humor which is both savage and kindly prevails, fueled by the magic of wonderful actors.  ""Three Women"" is extraordinarily rich in shared overtones.  As such I could watch it nearly as often as I listen to my favorite string quartet.",1082937600,3,1455,4.738095238095238
1998194,5,B0001GH5TW,"As a Robert Altman fan, I'm fully aware that he's a hit or miss director...with equal amounts of hits and misses. Yet, when he hits---he's a genius. ""3 Women"" contains the genius with the uncanny casting of Shelley Duvall as Millie, a would be sophisticate with no sophistication and Sissy Spacek as Pinky, a strange blank slate of a girl from Texas. The third woman is Willie (Janice Rule), an equally strange (and strangely silent) pregnant middle-aged artist who paints obscenely macabre murals of half-reptile half-human creatures in empty swimming pools. The setting is a small desert town in Arizona where Millie works as a physical therapy aide and meets Pinky, a new aide, who winds up her roommate. Pinky is fascinated by a pair of twins who work at the rest home and begins to study Millie's life and mannerisms. After nearly drowning in a suicide attempt, she winds up in a coma. When she recovers from the coma, Millie is told she has temporary amnesia. But Pinky is no longer Pinky, she's evolving into Millie. Willie will also assume a different role in the film's eerie, pastorial conclusion. Whether you like this or not depends on your tolerance for the unusual and challenging. Certainly the film has it's humor, like Millie's desperate attempts at being a social butterfly and everyone's blatant ignoring of her. It's funny, but there's also a sadness in Millie's refusal to accept her own failings. It's also chilling to watch Spacek as the childlike Pinky Rose, seemingly dumb as dirt yet studying everything around her---especially others as she apes their movements and mannerisms. As if she's looking for a vessel to inhabit. Then there's Willie, so silent---yet waiting, not only for the birth of her baby, but for something else as she paints her hideous art work. Nothing about ""3 Women"" is easily explained. It's a subtle, complex film with symbolism to spare. Even the film score is unnerving.  Recommended for film purists and of course Altman fans, but watch it for the stellar performances of 3 stunning actresses as well.",1082851200,12,2054,4.9193083573487035
1998195,5,B0001GH5TW,"Pinky (Sissy Spacek), an immature and timid girl, has recently left Texas for some unknown reason and acquired a job as a geriatric healthcare aid in the Palm Springs area.  She is guided into her new job by the talkative Millie (Shelley Duvall).  Millie's chattiness is often disregarded by her coworkers, neighbors, and all others as she desperately attempts to make connections with men.  However, Pinky perceives Millie as the perfect woman as she is the only person that pays any attention to her, which leads to the two of them becoming roommates.  This is the beginning for what could be called a surrealistic experience as the connection between two women with their similarities and differences develops.  Their connection leads into a whirlpool of emotional turmoil where the third enigmatic woman, Willie (Janice Rule), enters.  Wille is an artist that creates murals of amphibian women in struggles.

3 Women is dreamlike vision of what Altman once dreamed and later envisioned on the silver screen for the public to see.  When Altman's vision has been seen it is difficult to make into a clear picture as painfully uneasiness is instilled into the cerebral cortex while ambiguous notions are drifting in multiple directions.  This leaves interpretation completely to the audience as some hints of what Altman might want to say could offer some direction, yet lead astray the most cunning of cerebral minds.  Sissy Spacek and Shelley Duvall perform with brilliance as they bring this delusional imagination to life.  In the end, Altman leaves a brilliant cinematic experience for an audience to ponder for ages as there is no absolute analysis of 3 Women.",1082592000,3,1667,5.091911764705882

I saw this film during a Robert Altman movie marathon on cable TV years ago, and it is one of those movies that intrigued me so much that I never forgot it - in fact, kept a close on the TV schedule until it appeared again just a few years back so I could at least record my very own copy.  I'm a major Sissy fan (how can you not love her after Coal Miner's Daughter?)  Shelley Duvall also won my utmost respect for her portrayal as Millie, the hip socialite who doesn't have a clue... Experimental, yes, and I do agree, just why isn't this a classic?
The ""3rd"" woman, (FYI - Janice Rule, who passed away recently) is the woman painting the walls of the drained out swimming pool.  Now that role is a hard one to figure out - but it has some interesting moments when you go hummmmmm.....

8012120,2,B0001GH5TW,"Movie 8 of 1977 and 49 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

First half hour: aimless, focus on the mundane. My generation has many distractions. Not quite as many as millennials but more than the baby boomers I would say. Is my alternative sources for amusement making it hard to enjoy ""3 Women?"" Despite this unimpressive beginning there is a sense from the direction and music that something is bound to happen and for that it was able to keep my interests although my patience began to wear pretty thin.
After long, pointless meandering I couldn't help but wonder how long I could take it. I was fearful that if I turned it off I would never come back. A small flicker of odious contempt began to build in me if I detected that my time and attention was being wasted. At the point of the film where we go to the hang out - the bar, when we see the foam being blown off the beer, along with some questionable character motives that give a semblance of melodrama on the horizon, I couldn't help but predict that my ability to finish the film was in question. I couldn't help but wonder if Altman really deserved my time.
At the 43 minute mark I have been given two recipes, the process of getting a new room mate, a list of who owns what property, and a ""cute guy"" with a bad cold. I could list more but I think it's not hard to see that even if this is set up it doesn't matter. This isn't even artsy fartsy it's just straight up boring. It was funded because Robert Altman's name was on it. I mentioned earlier that I could not get through Gosford Park. It is a rare feat to get me to walk out on a movie but he got the job done with that one. Why should I invest in this movie? Because people say that Altman makes great movies? I'm not seeing it. If you like ""3 Women"" then I have a short story to tell you that you're are going to love. Now Robert Altman didn't write it but I think I got the goods. So here it goes: I am almost out of toothpaste, I shave my head every three days in the summer, I drive two hours a day, my dog sleeps too much, I hate having a data limit, almost time to buy new shoes! Don't worry, that was all set up. I'll tell you how it ends by the end of my review, I'm sure you are curious.
So my prediction was this: this story has one or two ideas that Altman had in mind but couldn't make a complete story for them so all of this domestic pablum was filler until we get to the heart of the matter.
An hour in and potential substance! So we have twins, Pinky obsessing with Millie, wearing Mille's clothes, reading millie's diary, clocking out with Millie's time card. I read that ""3 Women"" came to Altman in a dream. Wow! Altman dreams Igmar Bergman films? That's cool! I suppose you could make the same accusation toward ""Mulholland Drive"" and I love that movie but no dinner plans fall through in it, actual interesting things happen. I'm all for inspiration and tipping your hat just don't bore me please!
All of the issues of the vast majority of the film not withstanding one has to recognize the final forty minutes as sheer genius. It was truly fascinating to watch. It didn't save the movie in my mind but I loved it. Especially the dream sequence.
Another knock against the film is that it is ultimately pointless. I imagine one could be inventive and make one up but it would hardly be worth the effort in my eyes.

Pros
-final act was very good
-Spacek's acting was splendid
-very satisfying dream sequence
Cons
-calling this ""inspired"" by ""Persona"" is too generous. I think the better word is ""derivative.""
-very boring
-too long
-pointless
