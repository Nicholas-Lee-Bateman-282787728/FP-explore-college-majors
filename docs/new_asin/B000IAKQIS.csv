8144601,2,B000IAKQIS,"Had I known that Sam Cade and The Sheriff of Madrid were modern movies about modern sheriffs I would have NEVER bought this DVD. The description was somewhat deceptive.  Although there were 2 westerns on the discs that weren't all that good as movies, SAM CADE and THE SHERIFF of MADRID shouldn't be listed as ""Westerns""--it gives the impression that they are movies about the Old West, which isn't true. It's deceptive.  We'll keep the DVD, although I felt I'd wasted my $ on it, but I'll be very wary about any more movies from this seller.",1379030400,,542,4.577319587628866
