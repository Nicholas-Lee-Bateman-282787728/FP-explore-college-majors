1208082,1,B00000F7X5,"What else can I say about this movie? This... um... sequel (?) to a previous alien encounter film called Xtro is not only a blatant rip off of other, more popular Sci-Fi movies but it does them in the worst way possible. The script is a nightmare, the special effects are weak, the acting is weaker, and the whole idea just shouldn't have been done to begin with. Xtro II: The Second Encounter has nothing new (or even decent) to offer to science fiction or horror fans.

Have you seen the original Xtro? Don't worry if you haven't because this ""sequel"" has absolutely nothing to do with it. Not a single connection is made between the two movies other than an alien killer is on the loose. I guess director Harry Davenport just likes to name his alien invader movies Xtro no matter how unrelated they are. The worse thing about this is the movie makes references to significant stuff that happened in the past. To a casual viewer they might think it's the previous movie when in fact it's stuff that's not from any previous movie. The references are so ominous and evasive that you can't help but wonder what the heck they are talking about.

This is the sort of thing that plagues the script from beginning to end. The plot is vague and incoherent along with the fact some really dumb (and thankfully minor) plot twists are also splattered along the story. Essentially the movie moves from an Alien knock off plot with characters getting picked off one by one (and you can see it's coming a mile away) to an Aliens (the movie) knock off with more people getting picked off (again making you feel psychic for knowing who gets it and when). Any attempt to build suspense or fear fails miserably. The dialog is utter tripe, with lame one-liners and wannabe catch phrases all over the place. The more embarrassing being when they start doing ""tech talk"", which reminded me of Spaced Invaders. Only with Spaced Invaders they meant to make it sound silly.

Character development? You can forget that. The characters are written one-dimensional and the acting doesn't get much better. The only character with even a hint of decent dialog is Zunoski, but it's not enough to endorse this film.  All of the acting is pretty lame with just a little exception to Jano Frandsen, who in the final 20 minutes of the movie finally shows some character development. Actually there is probably ten minutes in this movie where I did start feeling interested in it and it's during this Frandsen moment. But again it's not enough to give this movie any kudos. Special effects aren't special at all. As a matter of fact it feels more like an 80's movie. That's probably due to a small budget. I will give props on the design of the alien monster, even if how it came to be, why it's killing everyone, and how the characters handle it give more than enough to ruin what little the movie has going for it.

Xtro II is a mistake. My only guess on why they made it was because they thought they could make money with just clichs and no well-developed story. I can only recommend this to Mystery Science Theater 3000 as they are the only ones who could make something of this picture. I don't recommend this anybody or anything else. If you seen the first two Alien movies you have already seen tons more than what this film can possibly offer.",1198368000,,3319,4.552763819095477
1208083,2,B00000F7X5,"I think you could make a drinking game of attempting to match scenes in this movie to Alien and Aliens. Fronm the grainy footage of a derelict spacecraft and people asking ""what is that?"" to the chest burster scene, to the person peering through a ceiling tiles, to the marine that goes crazy, to the large gun attached to the waist, the list goes on and on. It's almost worth watching to see how many ""matches"" you can make.",1167782400,,425,4.3924050632911396
7907819,4,B00000F7X5,"Xtro 2 is no Xtro 1. It's a bit like an unintentional Evil Dead 2 to Evil Dead 1. I got a sneaking suspicion that originally he intended to make a good movie but things got out of control once the perpetually drunk Jan Michael Vincent shows up. You can play a really fun game of how many times Jan Michael has to keep from throwing up on set. It happens a shocking number of times. It looks like a burp with an extra surprise is constantly threatening to escape. Even with that, Jan Michael isn't really all that bad. His character on the other hand makes no sense. He's written as a crazy man before turning into Ripley from Aliens. It's fun but not good much like the rest of the movie. Xtro 2 is a movie where the military looks shockingly close to a local hair metal band.

I don't know if it was the move to Canada, worse producers, or a director/writer who had given up that caused Xtro 2. I just wish that whatever combination of things that lead to it happen again and again.",1479254400,,983,4.201058201058201

7907826,1,B00000F7X5,"This disaster was unacceptably less British than the original Xtro and delivered none of the gore, schizophrenic cleverness or gross-out factor of its international original.

Xtro paid homage to the mouth-raping aliens from Alien.  The Second Encounter follows in the style of Aliens, in which these mouth-rapists are met with military force in more of an action movie.

Dr. Casserly (Tara Buckman; Silent Night Deady Night, Freddy's Nightmares) and Dr. Summerfield (Paul Koslo; Robot Jox, The Omega Man) have found a way to send people to another dimension.  When they send three men through their gateway, something goes wrong and communication is lost.  They send for Dr. Shepherd (Jan-Michael Vincent), the discoverer of this technology, for help.  What follows with that character's development is a testament to catastrophically poor writing.

They manage to teleport one of their lost travelers, Marshall (Tracy Westerholm; Stargate SG 1), back through the gateway.  She's pretty much comatose until a big, slimy, entrail-covered alien tears out of her and goes into the ventilation shaft...just like in Alien or The Terror Within (1989).  Their military personnel then hunt down the menace with the same guns as the colonial marines from Aliens.

Further blatantly ripping off Aliens, Dr. Summerfield gets the idea that it would be wiser to keep the alien safely contained than to kill it.  It hurt me when I sensed the end of that sentence in the movie.  Oh, and the alien kills with its tail like when the Alien queen impaled Bishop.  So bad.

This movie is truly awful.  The gore is weak and the creature looks dumb--when we rarely see any of it.  The action scenes hardly have any action as we swap close-up views of someone firing a gun and this slimy dinosaur-monster screeching.  After about fifteen minutes I could tell I'd be sitting around just waiting for this debacle to end.

Ouch!",1357084800,2,1903,5.044871794871795
7907827,1,B00000F7X5,"By the numbers Alien clone with very bad acting added into the mix.
If I was Fox, I'd sue, not for ripping the alien film off but for giving it a bad name.
This film stinks.",1295568000,,173,3.8333333333333335
7907828,3,B00000F7X5,"Xtro 2 is not a sequel to the clever, early 80s British horror film, Xtro, but more of a sci-fi oriented action flick that rips off Alien.  Government project involving parallel universes goes haywire when hostile beast is brought back and terrorizes the facility.  Doesn't sound terribly original and it isn't.  Director Harry Bromley-Davenport seems to hate this film just about as much as everyone else.  Davenport had the rights to the ""Xtro"" name, so he could slap in on anything.  He could make a film about the Boston Tea Party and call it Xtro if he wanted to.  Some Canadians got this ""sequel"" going and Davenport was pretty much just a hired on director along for the ride and used for the Xtro name.  Davenport explains in the bonus features on the first Xtro disc that he really had little to do with this film, even as the director.  He pretty much just did it for a paycheck and admits that the film is crap.  Jan Michael Vincent apparently was a bit of a problem considering he cared nothing for the project at all.  He didn't read the script or know what was happening in the story, didn't memorize his lines, so his lines had to be said to him by Davenport, and Vincent would simply repeat them back to him.  That's how all of Vincent's lines were done!  Man, this acting thing is a breeze, I'm in the wrong profession.  People have remarked upon how Vincent looks drunk the whole film, and I have to agree.  He's really stumbling through it, and it actually gives the movie an odd kind of entertainment value to watch the Jan Michael Vincent train wreck in action..
Xtro 2 isn't all that dreadful.  Even though it didn't have a single original bone in it's body, and was made by a bunch of schmucks, it was a rather painless hour and a half in front of the tv.",1241913600,,1778,4.427692307692308
