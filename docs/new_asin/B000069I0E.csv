1732472,4,B000069I0E,"When I first heard of Carmen : A Hip Hopera, I thought it was going to be another video with rappers indulging in themselves.
However, I was proved wrong. Even though it has a star-studded cast of rappers and singers, they concentrate on the story.
Knowles plays Carmen, an ambitious but tragically fated woman who intoxicated Mekhi Phifer's character. He plays the policeman who falls head over heels in love with her that he leaves his betrothed for her, goes to jail and runs away from the feds all for her. Mos Def plays the superior police man who wants to catch Phifer and he plays the disgusting, slimy police man perfectly. He gets special points here proving that he can act. Watch out for him in Monster Ball; he makes a small cameo.
Positive points: Knowles plays the sultry sex siren perfectly. Her undeniable beauty and acting skills create 'the black Carmen'. The music in this adaptation was great; Da Brat's opening and closing rap was fantastic.
Negative points: Jermaine Dupri needs to get over himself and stop appearing in films!",1059955200,,1049,4.769230769230769
1732473,5,B000069I0E,"I really didn't know what to expect from this, but I was very pleasantly surprised. There was very little, if any, 'reading' type of acting, you know, like where line delivery sounds as if they're reading straight from the cue cards.
Mos Def was a most convincing villain, Mekhi's rapping wasn't shabby at all and Beyonce did an excellent job on the acting.  The entire cast did a bang up job, in fact.  I will definitely be adding this to my collection...",1032998400,7,456,4.548780487804878

1732475,5,B000069I0E,"I loved Carmen it was such a cool movie. For me because I'm a big fan of Hip Hop and RnB. I loved the way it was like a musical but a modern one. It was like Annie in the ghetto. Beyonce was really good 4 it being her first movie. I usually have a bad thought about music stars being movie stars, but Beyonce just changed my whole point of view on that. I also liked that extras the MTV Special was cool, i like it when they let you see a lil part bout' how they made the movie.",1029801600,6,478,3.742574257425743

1732577,4,B000069I0E,"The term ""guilty-pleasure"" has become so trite and over-used. If you like something, you like it. Don't be embarrassed. That being said I LOVED this movie when it premiered back in the TRL days of MTV. I love musical theater/opera and Beyonce, so this was everything my little 14-year-old heart could have wanted. Bought the soundtrack, memorized all the songs, I was all in. Unfortunately the copy I had got a crack in it, so I was forced to repurchase.

I'ma be honest with you. I rated this 4 stars because of nostalgia, and my love for Queen Bey. It might actually warrant only 2. The lyrics will leave you baffled: ""Ayo I came from the projects/ Now I want the condos/ Tryna be a star/ And now you messin' up my cosmos"" (ugh) and the acting is...yeesh. Oooh BUT for a fun drinking game - take a shot every time Joy Bryant shows up dressed in something camo (this was the early 2000s, after all). Mom-drunk on wine is a really good mood to be in when you watch this. If you're a Beyhive stan and want to add this to your library, go for it. If you're reeeeaaaally curious at how a urban re-telling of the Carmen opera looks like, also go for it. Otherwise....I think there are clips on YouTube?",1435708800,,1198,4.37219730941704

This musicial - melo/drama - based work will catch any persons attention after they reconize the catchy tunes. Especially if tthe have had any exposure to Classical music in their earlier years in high school. Afterall all hip hop music is not about  the bling , women & cars. Example R.Kelly's The Closet.

1732743,5,B000069I0E,What better way to teach students how a long standing famous/popular opera was used as a Hip Hopera.  The story line pretty much followed the original story line  (key incidents) with a few exceptions and a few embellishments.,1324339200,3,226,4.921052631578948
1732744,4,B000069I0E,This was a great way to teach history. Ha! There is a lot of action in this movie and it is actually quite entertaining. The music and singing is really good too.,1260057600,3,162,4.09375

Hill is engaged to the perfect woman (not Beyonce, another girl)... until one night when he has to drive Carmen to the police station and thats when the drama begins. Carmen will do anything to get out of going to jail. Even seducing him. And thats where everything starts to go wrong..

Its not anything spectacular, but its good to watch once or twice. The songs in it are pretty good.. especially ""If looks could kill"" which Beyonce & Mos Def sang really well... and the twist definately suprised me. There are some boring bits, but overall i enjoyed it and i think its worth watching.

Oh and the quality of the dvd was good too!",1231459200,10,748,4.452554744525547
1732755,4,B000069I0E,Carmen is a hip hop remake of the classic film Carmen Jones. The film stars Beyonce from Destiny's Child as Carmen. Carmen is an actress trying to make it with the love of Mehki Pfefier. But Mos Def a dirty cop stands in the way. A lot of people love to trash Beyonce acting skills but I think she did an all right job here.,1206489600,2,324,4.0
1732756,4,B000069I0E,"It is as old as humankind, the ancient battle of the sexes.  MTV does a good job in interpreting Bizet's finest masterpiece to modern-day realities, this time in inner-city Philadelphia where a virtuous police officer met Carmen at a well-populated watering hole. After arresting Carmen during a catfight, he gradually lost all self-control by spending a night at her apartment that resulted in his demotion and loss of his fiance.  Things went downhill afterwards.  Beyonce was good at playing the femme fatale character.

I definitely recommend this DVD.",1134950400,4,556,5.284090909090909
1732757,4,B000069I0E,"I think the movie was great, even if beyonce doesn't seem that type of girl, she still did a great job. Even more then the movie itself, i just loved the ""making of carmen"" that u can find in the special features. I think it's worth buying!

1732758,1,B000069I0E,"I thought this movie was going to be much better. I really love musicals so I expected much more from this film, not only were the songs horrible but the acting was not at all convincing. I rented this movie from Blockbuster and it took me three nights to watch it because I kept falling asleep. Yes, it is that boring! I almost didn't want to finish it but I had to see if it would get better, it didn't.  Do not waste your time with this movie. There were no powerful or memorable songs or parts and there was no plot. I didn't care about the characters or what happened to them. It was just dumb. Beyonce was all right as Carmen, she has a beautiful voice but that's all that kept this movie going. I can understand why a guy would want to watch this movie, there is plenty of Beyonce strutting her stuff but if you are a girl and you are watching it for the reason I did, looking for a love story with great music as a backdrop, then forget it, you won't find it here.",1073174400,12,972,4.0890052356020945
