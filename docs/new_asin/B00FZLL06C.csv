6042251,5,B00FZLL06C,"Manchester United has produced some great footballers over the years, but none more prolific than the group of David Beckham, Paul Scholes, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, and Nicky Butt.  That class of footballers defined Manchester United for many years.

The Class of 92 is an incredible film about that special group of footballers. The film is absolutely first-class in every regard.

Most importantly it offers a rare glimpse into the world of great footballers, focusing on their roots and development as players.  This film has the feel of a private chat with several of Man Us biggest stars of the modern era.  Its like having a pint or a meal with some of the greatest players the Red Devils have ever produced.

There is a lot of powerful reminiscing and storytelling.  There are some poignant moments, especially when they talk about the Munich Air Disaster and Busbys Babes.  Interviews with Sir Alex Ferguson, Tony Blair, and Eric Cantona frame the film in a spectacular, star-studded kind of way.

The best part has to be the footballers candidly talking about each other.  They clearly love the game and go about it the right way. Their friendships were built from hard work and a long journey together to be the very best.  The content is completely natural and unrehearsed, something that is absolutely priceless.

This group has built upon a great tradition at Manchester United, giving the next generation a lot to live up to.  A massive fan of English football, I have to say I even learned a lot from the film.  It certainly was an all-encompassing piece, bringing music, art, politics, history, and culture into the beautiful game.

The Class of 92 is easily one of the best soccer films I have ever seen, certainly on par with Once in a Lifetime and The Two Escobars, considered by many to be the best ever in the genre.

Youll never look at these players the same way again.",1404691200,4,1966,4.789317507418398

6042264,5,B00FZLL06C,"Hard to not get emotional if you grew up watching these guys play or if you are a Manchester United player. The 6 players talk about what went on and off the pitch, and some of the personal stories of themselves, and how the media made it look and sound like it was the end of the world.",1430438400,,287,3.9655172413793105
6042265,5,B00FZLL06C,"This was a very engaging documentary, full of interesting tidbits and cool stories.  The filmmakers didn't over or under utilize Becks, and they made a point of showing the easy chemistry between the six of them.  It was nice to learn more about Nicky Butt, the least famous of the bunch, at least to American viewers for the most part, and we got to see that Paul Scholes (my favorite all time player) has quite the wry sense of humor.

Note to buyers, the timeline of the doc only goes up to the Champions League final of 1999, though of course the interviews were done recently.  So anything that happens after that isn't touched upon.  Still, I loved it.

Five stars with ease.",1428710400,3,681,4.495934959349594

8619764,4,B00FZLL06C,"We are huge Beckham fans.  This is an amazing story with great footage. The only setback is that the accents are so thick in parts that it's hard to decipher what is being said. We watched this as a family w our 12 and 14 yr old boys and there were several times when one of us said, "" I can't understand a word they're saying !""  Subtitles would have been super helpful. We got the main ideas though, and wow, again, what a story!!",1483574400,,432,4.070588235294117
8619765,5,B00FZLL06C,"If you are a soccer fan, then this is for you.  If not, then forget it.

The class of '92 refers to that group of youngsters who joined Manchester United as teenagers and went on to become the greatest team in England's illustrious soccer history.  These five became professionals while barely in their teens, and became dependent upon each other.  David Beckham, who is one of the most recognized names in the world (not merely the sports world) was and remains a buddy of a group of five equal buddies.  They left their families at a ridiculously early age (David Beckham was age 14) and joined their famous coach to form a bond that took them to the highest pinnacle of the most popular sport in the world.  The friendly banter and jesting show the close friendships that united them on and off the pitch. The narrative among the group is interspersed with videos of their childhood devotion to the sport and their feats as they progressed through the professional world of European Football.  Although their robust and friendly banter over the fantastic plays they made is enjoyable and reflects their appreciation of each players skill, it is their genuine friendship that shows through.  The love that bound them in their playing days still binds.",1459728000,,1253,4.7953488372093025
8619766,4,B00FZLL06C,"Ryan Giggs is my all time favorite player, so I knew a lot of his childhood story, but it was great to hear about the other major team players from that academy class, particularly how David Beckham was almost predetermined to play for the Red Devils.  My only gripe is that the game memories centered around the Treble - and while I too relish the achievement- it would have been to see some other games outside of Beckham's ""moon shot"" against Wimbedon. Not to the level of ""Senna"" - which is a 6.5 out of 5 stars movie - but thankfully all these gents are still alive.",1457136000,,571,4.336448598130841
