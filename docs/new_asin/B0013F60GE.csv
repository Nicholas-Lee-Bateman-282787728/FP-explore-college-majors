8250543,5,B0013F60GE,"This DVD was great to watch, I had been eyeing it for some time and it was worth every penny spent, I tried to buy it at HMV but it's no longer stocked.

If you are like me and enjoy all things Empire this DVD i would recommend, and the Narrator as has a very good voice that will hold your interest.
there is colour footage also that they found in Russia that is colour footage of a Imperial event like trooping the colour in India which alone in my opinion makes the show so great.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone that wants to see colour video footage and just likes history on the Empire",1378857600,,596,4.094017094017094
8250544,4,B0013F60GE,"This is somewhat of a fresh look at the too-often vilified British Empire (you know, it has become so tediously and fastidiously politically-correct to bash the British). This presents a more balanced point of view.",1375920000,3,215,5.171428571428572
8250545,5,B0013F60GE,"I am a great fan of documentaries. And I have seen many on the British empire. This is exceptional and singular. As a product of a British stlye education in post colonial Ghana, I was entralled to follow the events leading to Ghana's independence in 1957. In truth, it all started with Gandhi. It is all the more thrilling to watch the account on modern day Britain; a true potpourri of the remnants of degradation of empire.",1254441600,3,426,4.545454545454546
8250546,5,B0013F60GE,"This is one of the most stunning documentaries I've seen, and I've seen many hundreds of them.  This is real color (not colorized) motion picture film of the British Empire, including London scenes, from the 1920s and earlier and later.  The producers also provide us with a sober narration and include acted quotes from letters and the like in the format that's become so familiar.  If you are either an Anglophile or a history buff, or are just fascinated by early newsreels, home movies, or documentary footage, pounce!",1230681600,2,522,4.909090909090909
8250547,3,B0013F60GE,"While the imagery shown was 1st rate and a joy to see. I frankly was put off by the narration. While once in a while, mention was made of the good done by the British. They lovingly detailed every goof, mistake and evil deed done in the name of the Empire. Which is a pity as the British Empire is a great story that needs to be told but without the bias.",1223683200,4,355,3.9444444444444446
8250548,5,B0013F60GE,"Delightfully, more color film continues to be found, restored and shared.  History does live in our present beliefs, conflicts, loves and tragedies; it was, as it is now, in glorious, gory color.  Maybe these newer generations, not as protected by B&W, will pay better attention to our human story.  Amazing to see Gandhi in color, and as one who spent a brief 3 years in colonial East Africa (58-61, me being 8-11 years old), the material on the Mau-Mau uprising and Kenya's eventual independence was simply astounding.  History fans, anglophiles, documentary film enthusiasts should be well pleased.  My only wish is for more, even more of this stuff, please and thank you.",1217548800,11,675,4.991071428571429
8250549,3,B0013F60GE,"If you are expecting to see something of a balanced history of the British Empire (good, bad, ugly) illustrated with color video - you are half right.

The film is in color. And generally, the source video quality was quite good.

The program itself is not a comprehensive history of the empire or even the end of the empire. There are some interesting film sequences (though few I'd classify as outstanding) that seemed to miss most of the target. It was very heavy on India and Israel and sparse on other parts of the empire.

The editorial view is left of center, and many film bits seem to be used to set up some negative quotation or to show anyone who hadn't figured it out by that point in the film, that the empire was bad.

The lack of even a pretense at being an unbiased (or merely comprehensive) study of the subject was surprising.

I was so put off by the dvd, that I ordered the companion book (through an Amazon re-seller) to see if the text was as pompous as the video.

Can you say ""sucker?""

Actually, the text was worse than the dvd, the book's author observing that Mountbatten was appointed Viceroy ""to ensure that the British would leave their precious Raj with dignity.""

That the Falklands War ""proved very little except that the British had lost very little of their pugilistic nature.""

And of England today ""Britain is now a microcosm of its old empire: Not a global empire of ruler and ruled, but a society of equals, all sharing the mother country. Now Britain has to learn to live with that.""

Sort of like ""You ate all those pies, you fat s.o.b., now deal with the high cholesterol and have an early heart attack! You'll be better off when you're submerged in a Franco-German Europe and, where your grandkids will speak Esperanto, anyway!""

Ironically, lefty text to the side, the book has a better representation of color images of the empire than the dvd set did, so if I had it to do over - I'd buy the book and skip the dvd.",1210809600,23,1960,4.446927374301676
