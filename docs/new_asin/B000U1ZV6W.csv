2913725,5,B000U1ZV6W,"I have only watched Dolores Claiborne from this four-movie DVD set so far.  As always, Kathy Bates is great, but the real plus to this movie (beside the story) was Jennifer Jason Leigh!  She delivered a powerful performance as Dolores' daughter and you could really feel the pain and anguish of this young woman.  I loved this book and although I've watched the movie only once thus far, I will watch it again and again.  For those unfamiliar with Stephen King's work, you may not know this book is slightly related to the ""Storm of the Century"" movie/script that I found to be the best-ever Stephen King book-to-screen movie yet.

Sorry, I can't reflect on the other movies in this set yet, but Dolores is watchable and more understandable after having read the book.",1263081600,,768,4.701492537313433
2913726,4,B000U1ZV6W,"This set gives you four movies on two flipside discs. All are in Widescreen.
Dolores Claiborne-Kathy Bates, Jennifer Jason Leigh. Im starting with this one because as a King fan this movie has always disappointed me. If you have ever read this great novel(directed more towards the women audience) you will find it starts with Vera Donovan falling down the stairs and Dolores Standing over her with a rolling pin(as does the movie) and basically thats where the movie stops copying the novel it supposedly takes after. In the novel, Dolores is taken into the police station where she starts talking about her relationship with Vera. She starts from the beginning where she was a young woman who takes the job because her husband drinks and seldomly works. Vera is strict and wants things her way and Dolores is strong enough to put up with her. The movie completely omits the two other children Dolores has(both boys) and focuses on her daughter only. In the novel, Veras husband dies and her two children(also never mentioned in the movie) quit coming with her during the summer. Dolores is beaten several times by her husband and her daughter idolizes him. She notices her daughter slowly start to change(not looking clean, dressing in baggy cloths, quiet, not hanging around her dad anymore)and decides to take the ferry one day to have a talk with her. This scene does play out similarly in the movie. She goes to the bank to take out the money she has saved so she can leave. She finds Joe took it all out and redeposited it in a new acct. She cries to Vera, who suggests that Husband die Dolores. They have accidents and leave their wives widows with all of their money. This is where Dolores realizes that Vera killed her own husband. She goes home and buys Joe whiskey and makes him a sandwich, then mentions the money to anger him. She runs into the berry patch and jumps over the well, where he falls into it. He does not die right away(as in the movie). She hears him crying all night long...Doloreeeessssss. Heeellppp mmeeee. It Huuurtss.....finally she goes to check on him and he has almost crawled out. She takes a piece of wood and hits him in the face(knocking out his dentures)then he finally falls to his death. Her daughter suspects her mom of killing her dad and they are never close again. All her children move away and she moves in with Vera to take care of her. HER DAUGHTER DOES NOT COME BACK IN THE NOVEL!!!! I say this because the movie brought her back and made up its own story of Dolores and her daughter....this is not how the book is at all!! If the screen writer had stayed to the novel(it plays out like a movie) this movie would be up there with the Shawshank Redemption! Too bad he didn't write the screen play for this novel! Then in the novel, Dolores cares for Vera throughout the years, battling Veras horrible visions of Dust Bunnies, Dolores, They are EVERYWHERE! Bedpans,hysterics, vacuuming the rug just so(Vera listens to make sure) also combatting with Vera who in her elderly years enjoys pooping in her bed and throwing it around the room while Dolores is vacuuming....Then one day Vera has one of her few good days, and realizes she doesnt want to live like this anymore and throws herself down the stairs(like in the movie). Dolores is told she inherits Veras fortune, to which she asks ""Why me? She has two kids!"" Then she finds that Veras kids died way back when they were teenagers in a sportscar the Vera had boughten them. Vera never aknowledged it, and lived as if her kids had moved away and might come to ""visit"" her. There is no anomisity between Dolores and the fictional version of the sheriff, as in the movie. If you read this book(or have read it) and absolutely LOVE it, You will absolutely HATE this movie.
Dreamcatcher was a bad novel and a bad movie(cant believe Morgan Freeman did this one)
Cats Eye is a great movie. It is a collection of short stories(all are in novella collections except the last with Drew Barrymore) and the screenplay is by Stephen King himself.
Creepshow is also a good collection of short stories and is very enjoyable. My favorite story is the one with Ted Danson. Overall, if you like at least two of these movies, this collection is a great buy! I know I was long-winded about Dolores Claiborne,but they had Kathy Bates..why did they completly RUIN this potentially great movie??? I wish someone would redo this one and recast Kathy Bates!!!!Where IS Frank Darabont on this one?????",1260662400,,4480,4.636477987421384
2913727,5,B000U1ZV6W,"There's no ""extras"" in this Stephen King flip-disc double pack beyond movie trailers. Widescreen transfers are of excellent quality.

All four titles are appealing, but for different reasons.

DOLORES CLAIBORNE is the most ""normal"" film here. It deals with a mother/daughter relationship and their past history, plus the mom's renewed trouble with a local sheriff who has been trying for about 20 years to see her convicted of murder.

Just saw CREEPSHOW for the first time and really liked it. Here, a father takes his pre-teen's horror comic book away and trashes it. The book flips open and a single panel from five different comics segues to live action, in other words, into five short stories. Best of the lot is ""Tide,"" the one in the middle. King himself is the star of tale #2. After we see all five there's a final shock for the dad who foolishly threw his kid's book away.

CAT'S EYE is another anthology, one that follows a gray tom's adventures as he travels south, roughly along the East Coast. In North Carolina, the cat bonds with a very young Drew Barrymore, who can't convince her scoffing parents that there's a small monster hiding inside her bedroom wall.

DREAMCATCHER features a malignant version of the magic we see in THE GREEN MILE (1999), but it's really a very gross film about giant razor-toothed worms from outer space trying to conquer Earth via the water supply. A bloody stomach-turner, this one!

Parenthetical numbers preceding titles are 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll ratings.

(5.9) Cat's Eye (1985) - Drew Barrymore/James Woods/Alan King/Robert Hays/Candy Clark

(6.5) Creepshow (1982) - Hal Holbrook/Adrienne Barbeau/Fritz Weaver/Leslie Neilsen/Carrie Nye/E.G. Marshall/Ed Harris/Ted Danson/Stephen King

(7.2) Dolores Claiborne (1995) - Kathy Bates/Jennifer Jason Leigh/Judy Parfitt/Christopher Plummer/David Strathairn/Eric Bogosian/John C. Reilly

(5.3) Dreamcatcher (2003) - Morgan Freeman/Thomas Jane/Jason Lee/Tom Sizemore/Donnie Wahlberg",1255132800,31,1978,5.413680781758957
2913728,5,B000U1ZV6W,"Creepshow was one of the older movies and very, very good based on the concept of the old scary comic book stories. It is a must have for any Stephen King fan for their collection. It's good with a bowl of popcorn on Halloween night.
Cats eye is a series of stories that takes you through the adventures of a cat on his way to save a little girl from a troll. Each story has you on the edge of your seat. There is a lot of psychology at work with this one and the stories end with the final one with Drew Barrymore playing the little girl who is saved by the brave furry little ""General"" who protects her even going as far as to play the troll on the record player and send him flying into a box fan. It's also a good movie.
Dreamcatcher is too good a movie to tell you about so I'm not going to spoil it.
Morgan Freeman gives a magnificent performance and well lets just say, you'll never
say SSDD again without thinking of this movie. It's a good movie. Watch it.
Dolores Claiborne is in my opinion the definition of true horror, working hard all her life to try to give her child a future only to find she's married to a monster who takes the money and abuses the child in a way that is just unthinkable. I think
this one would be good for any psychology class dealing on subjects of coercive paraphilias to gain an understanding of what it is like for victims of it. It would
be an excellent movie for certain kinds of psychology or sociology classes.",1246838400,5,1455,4.181494661921708
2913729,3,B000U1ZV6W,"...Cat's Eye is the standout feature and I don't really care for the other three.  I bought it for Cat's Eye hoping that I might like one of the others.  Still, I am reasonably satisfied as this was only a few dollars more than the Cat's Eye only dvd.
  If you are a fan of Creepshow as well as Cat's Eye it is worth the purchase.  I think I would have walked out on Dreamcatcher if I saw it in theaters.  And Delores Claiborne is a somber movie about abuse so it isn't quite what you might want in a Stephen King film.
  Cat's Eye is a trilogy of stories with dark humor and suspense.  I think it is one of the quintesential 80s films and you can detect King's brand of humor and style throughout.  It is a real gem.
  Creepshow seemed like five stories that kept hitting the same note.  It has campy acting and the stories pretty much end the same: with a dead guy coming back for revenge or someone dying a gruesome death.  Often both.  But I can see how it might be an enjoyable cult film for some.",1206921600,6,1002,4.092783505154639

2913816,3,B000U1ZV6W,"Delores Claiborne is slow and dramatic, but still a fine example of King's craft.  Dreamcatcher is ""campy"" and does not follow the book very well.  Cat's Eye is a little girl saved by the family pet, plus having a few other adventures.  Creepshow is a collection of several TV episodes and very predictable.  Any veteran reader of King's work will recognize the difficulty of creating a visual show since much of his work deals with the internal story and happenings within several characters.  This used to be accomplished by having the protagonist talk with a sidekick, and less often with a ""voice over"" to represent thoughts, but that has mostly fallen by the way.  Books have always been my favorite form of entertainment!",1453420800,,727,4.869918699186992

2914028,5,B000U1ZV6W,"Well got this because of Delores Clayborne, it was a great movie I read the book first, an was fairly close to the book. Dream catcher is a good movie but, way gross in the blood an guts factor, but good plot an story. Creep show was just funny in the fact of short stories. Cat's eye haven't watched all the way through yet, I think I read that book too, not sure.
Anyways would recommend this series of Stephen king movies. Thank you.",1366848000,,436,4.2023809523809526

Kathy Bates was especially good as Delores Claiborne. Being a cat person, this reviewer was fascinated by the Cat's Eye. Morgan Freeman is wonderful in the Dreamcatcher, and the Creepshow was hilarious.",1364342400,,332,5.283018867924528

""Dreamcatcher"" is not one of his best, but the acting is good. If you have read the book, you will spot the irregularities.

2914065,5,B000U1ZV6W,"It was a great idea to add these multi packs of movies.  I am a big fan of Stephen King word, read most of his books, and many of the movie are close.  These four movies, jump from the supernatural to the daily living of the abused.
dreamcatcher is a great movie, has a solid story, good actors, alot of gore, but some true meaning. I don't like to give away a movie or it's ending, I believe every person has a right to an opinion.
Dolores Claiborne is one of my all time favorites, and Kathy Bates is great in it.  Not a typical scary movie, but real, and strong, and strong subject matter.  Really some powerful stuff.
Cat's eyes is a you're a kid, enjoying your first horror flick, it's good, not as scary as you remember but this full of memories and of course a very young, cute drew barrymore.
cheepshow- just awesome, comic book, good, scary, creepy, gorey, wonderful stuff.",1280361600,13,882,4.359756097560975

There's great commradity there. Cat's Eye is a childhood favorite- cheesy but I got it so my son could enjoy it as I did at his age. And Creepshow is, well, Creepshow!!
