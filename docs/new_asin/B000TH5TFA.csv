8209454,4,B000TH5TFA,"This is an excellent dvd about shooting and tactics. In his original Defensive Pistol series McCann covered vehicle exfil. However, the car in that had bench seats front and rear. That is pretty rare these days with bucket seats and center consoles in the way in most vehicles. This has updated techniques. McCann points out some things not to do as well. This dvd series is well worth your time if you are interested in pistolcraft.",1365552000,,433,4.7105263157894735
