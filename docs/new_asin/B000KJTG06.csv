8579655,5,B000KJTG06,"This movie is great, it is also sad as well.  It is certainly a Greek tragedy. Highly recommend this movie",1362355200,,106,4.3
8579656,4,B000KJTG06,"This film is really worth seeing for anyone who's interested in seeing a different side to Greece. Its no good for special affects or intense action but it is quite moving. Its also quite gritty, I think it portrays Greece in a more real way. The story is based on real events too which makes it even more moving. The relationship between Albanians and Greeks interests me and this film gives an incite into some of the prejudices that each hold against each other. This means there are many different angles from which to consider the story-line.",1193788800,3,547,4.649484536082475
