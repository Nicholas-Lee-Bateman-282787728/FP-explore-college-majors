631229,3,6303340830,"A lot of words have been spent describing, criticizing or simply discarding this movie. Pity, after all it's an inoffensive adventure movie a la Tarzan and as such it should be considered.
My three stars go out to the poor bushman who probably played himself and didn't get mentioned in the credits.
He's actually the reason why this movie is worth watching. All the rest is cheap anti-communism propaganda of the lowest and brainless level.
The director seems to tell us ""Hey guys, the Communists got it up their a... in Afghanistan and in Africa too, so why should we blame our boys for having lost the Vietnam War?"".
The script came from a spoiled child with too much time to do something useful with it.
And yet, despite all the ""propaganda"" bit, ""Red Dawn"" it is not... if you know what I mean. Thank God for that!
It's the simple story of a Spetnaz (the russian equivalent to Special Forces in the U.S. Army or the S.A.S. in the British Army) who gets an assignment as an undercover hitman to kill an African rebel leader.
Unfortunately for him, once in the midst of the Rebel group he starts to understand why they revolt and sympathises with their cause.
Bad mistake! He's captured by the Russian secret service, tortured and thrown out of the Spetnaz with dishonor.
Abandoned in the midst of an unknown African wilderness, he's suddenly confronted with the harshness of the land and must learn very fast how to survive in it.
Unfortunately for him some lessons learned are soon forgotten thanks to exhaustion and sleepiness. In fact, no sooner is he asleep that a very venomous scorpion decides to sting him.
The real movie starts here. Will he survive or not? Well, thanks to the said Bushman he gets his skin saved for a little longer.
At first, the giant Lundgren mocks the little man for being so primitive and so backward and seems to take pleasure at teasing him, despite his gratefulness for having being saved by the Bushman.
Very soon though the positions get reversed, and this is the really interesting plot twist of the movie. Lundgren is not a great actor, or even an actor at all, but in his clumsiness and genuine naivete' he gets through in convincing us about his helplessness out there in the wild.
Soon enough the wisdom of the old Bushman gets revealed to him and now a true friendship starts to ensue between two worlds as alien and as far apart as can be.
Not only do they become friends but start to respect each other as human beings, and out of this relationship comes the final strong reaction of Lundgren when he sees that the Bushman's entire village, family and friends have been wildly butchered by so-called ""civilized"" people. Lungren's own bunch.
While the Bushman hardly utters a word watching the scene and seems to linger in a state of deep shock at what he sees, Lundgren gets upset and swears to the old man that his family won't have died in vain.
A noble reaction, but probably one the Bushman wouldn't accept, also because it is not in his nature.
From here on the movie returns to his old actioner cliche' of Rambo's fame.
Naturally, somebody must have had some doubts on how to end the movie, but such doubts didn't last very long... Pity!
Lundgren seems more comfortable acting with the Bushman than surrounded by professional actors and at his level it is more than comprehensible. This is also where he is at his best.
So, in conclusion, if you are a Tarzan fan, this movie comes very close to that genre, with a touch of Rambism and a touch of Italian Stave Reeves' Hercules you may be served.
If you thought about a deep movie, this is absolutely not it.
It's pure escapism with a touch of sprinkled Pathos on top.
I would still recommend it just for the poor Bushman who did his job with honesty and generosity.
If you are an actor or a Drama student watch him carefully because you may still learn a thing or two about how an amateur can sometimes steal the show from a professional, despite his training and upbringing.
I only wished somebody someday will finally retrace the Bushman's name and include it on the DVD or VHS tape cover. He deserves it more than Lundgren...",1026777600,9,4132,4.577597840755735

It's not because of the acting,  which ranges from over-the-top to wooden. It's not because of the story  line which is serviceable, with one exception -- there's a terrific  sequence involving Dolph Lundgren and a bushman that is touching and funny  and moves me every time I see the film. I'm hard-pressed to actually cite  something specific about the film that makes it so much fun for me to  watch.  Lundgren is completely believable as a special forces soviet  trooper.  It may be the part he was born to play.  His character is a  trained killer but with a mind.  And he uses it. I've watched this film a  dozen or so times over the past decade.  I finally bought it on DVD because  my tape won't last forever. The DVD image is sharper than my VHS and the  sound is clean.

631562,5,6303340830,"Dolph Lundgren SHOULD have been a much bigger action-star than he has been, and still is. Unfortunately, there already was a muscleman with a Germanic accent very well established in the spotlight (You know who!).

 Of all the action-movie stars in the glorious 1980s, Dolph had the MOST credentials toward actually being the super-commando that action-stars commonly portray.

When it was Dolph Lundgren's time to perform mandatory conscription in Sweden's armed forces, he joined the navy to be a Kustjagarna operator. The Kustjagarna (Coastal Rangers) are Sweden's best special-operations unit, their mission is to scout the coast-line in search of Soviet naval reconaissance and spetsnaz infiltrators. Similar to U.S. Navy S.E.A.L.s, Marines, and army Rangers in their tasks, they also perform anti-terrorist missions.

Dolph Lundgren was also a champion competitor in karate tournaments before and after his military service. He has a degree in Electrical engineering, but ultimately chose to be an actor.

One of the best Dolph Lundgren movies, Red Scorpion is the story of Nicolai, a Soviet Spetnaz agent deployed to a fictional African nation (strongly resembling Angola). Here the loyal soviet commando is tasked with a secret mission to inflitrate the Anti-communist patriot rebels, ...and assassinate their leader.

Under the pretense of serving as a Soviet advisor to Cuban and African allies, Nicolai has a change of heart.  Observing the typical bloody atrocities that communist forces intentionally inflict on civilians, ...Nicolai joins the good-guys! This film is jam-packed with plenty of machinegun-shootin', grenade-hurling, close-quarter hand-to-hand combat, communist-wasting action!",1393286400,,1705,5.768924302788845

631632,4,6303340830,"One of Dolph Lundgren's best starring films (which I know isn't saying a whole lot, but still), Red Scorpion is one of the most overlooked action gems from the 80s.  Lundgren plays a Soviet Special Forces Lieutenant in Africa that turns against his fellow Soviets when he realizes that he's been fighting on the wrong side all along.  That's pretty much it story wise, but what Red Scorpion delivers in terms of direction (by Joseph Zito, who helmed the Chuck Norris action cheese-fests Missing in Action and Invasion USA, as well as horror favorites The Prowler and Friday the 13th Part 4), action sequences, and makeup effects from the great Tom Savini more than makes up for any of its other shortcomings.  Red Scorpion also has the dubious honor of being produced and written by convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff, which in itself makes it worth seeing regardless.  Synapse Films went out of their way to pack enough special features into this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack (they usually do) as well as beautifully restore the film's picture as well.  All in all, if action movies are your thing, check out Red Scorpion, you'll be glad that you did.",1339804800,7,1144,4.816326530612245
631633,4,6303340830,"Action star Dolph Lundgren got his big break playing Russian Ivan Drago in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rocky-IV/dp/B0006GAOGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rocky IV</a>&nbsp;(1985), and he again plays a Russian in his fourth film Red Scorpion (1988), a military adventure set in Africa.  Lundgren is Lt. Nikolai Rachenko, a member of ""Spetsnaz""(Russian special forces) who is sent undercover to locate and assassinate a resistance leader.  The action sequences are generally very well executed and often extreme, as the brute force of modern mechanized armies are unleashed on the native people.  The film doesn't dwell on tragedy, taking a mostly surreal approach to the mayhem, and stylizing the violence.  Red Scorpion also includes a ""spiritual"" element, as Rachenko comes to realize how the Soviets have been abusing the people, and becomes enlightened to their native ways.

Events take place in an African nation where forces of the Soviet Union and Cuba, are involved in the subjugation of the native people.  Operating independently of the Cubans, the Soviets are after a rebel leader named Ango Sundata (Ruben Nthodi) who is in hiding somewhere in the bush.  Following orders from General Vortek (T.P. McKenna), Rachenko gets himself tossed in jail, where Sundata's close friend Kallunda Kintash (Al White) is being held.  When the opportunity presents itself, Rachenko, Kintash, and gutter-mouthed American reporter Dewey Nelson (M. Emmet Walsh), make a spectacular escape.

The trio eventually meet up with Sundata`s group, but Nikolai fails in his attempt to kill him and is knocked out and captured by the Cubans.  Nikolai is abandoned by his commander, and suffers some cruel torture, before again escaping from captivity.  Out in the desert, Nikolai is rescued by a native tribesman (Regopstaan), who teaches him the ways of the desert, and how to survive.  For his accomplishments, Nikolai receives a scorpion shaped tattoo, and when he rejoins what remains of Sunadata's group, he finds acceptance, and becomes the leader of an assault force against the communists.  Where all the armed rebels came from is something of a mystery, as Dolph employs his trademark shotgun, before setting his sights on destroying his former commander

Red Scorpion is mostly about featuring fighting and destruction, however there is only so much that can be blown up in a desert.  The film definitely has its yahoo moments, but also looks at the tragedy of war.  The scenes where a Hind gunship is featured in the destruction of a small village, while deploying chemical weapons may be a bit heavy handed, but are still quite striking.  There is a certain subtlety and poignancy during the transitional period that Rachenko spends with the native people.  It features almost no verbal communication, yet is still quite understandable.

While Red Scorpion will never be mistaken for more than a big 80's action movie, the humanitarian elements do provide balance and some sense of realism, which kind of separates it from the pack.  Lundgren's performance isn't broad, but it has some depth, and familiar faces like Carmen Argenziano and Brion James, help give the opposition some personality.  M. Emmet Walsh's character is over the top and excessively noisy, but provides the film's only comic relief.

631691,3,6303340830,"It is rumored that Jack Abramoff earned roughly ten million dollars (after taxes) in his first and apparently only movie production.  In other words, he was already a wealthy man before entering the political world of Washington, DC.  Abramoff even wrote the screenplay along with another member of his family, Robert.  Alas, this movie concerning the Cold War battles fought within the African hemisphere leaves much to be desired.  Dolph Lundgren was still  somewhat a major name in 1989 and could basically carry the movie all by himself.  As matter of fact, that's precisely what he does!  Red Scorpion was modestly successful only because of his involvement.  Lundgren plays the role of a Russian special ops soldier who eventually sees the light and becomes an arch foe of the evil USSR.  Character actor M. Emmet Walsh is a journalist willing to take great chances to get the story out about the viciousness of the Soviet empire. T.P. McKenna, Carmen Argenziano, and Brion James fill out the rest of the ""name"" cast.  The plot makes little sense.  It is the never-ending violence and action scenes which might halfway satisfy an unsophisticated audience.  No, this movie doesn't even come close to winning any major motion picture awards.

Who should see this so-so action film?  I would recommend only those who find the Jack Abramoff aspect of particular interest.  Perhaps it might help one better understand his ultimate fall from grace.  The man didn't create a cinematic masterpiece.  Nonetheless, he deserves credit in sensing how best to make sure it turned a healthy profit.

The remaining story is just a portion of gibberish, and low budget doesn't excuse it in any way - the great ""Rumble fish"" or ""Dark Side of the Sun"" aren't the blockbusters either.

My verdict - if you want some bubble-gum for brains and also to watch some bad russian murderers who are also responsible for the tornadoes in the U.S., earthshakes in Japan and for the eclipses (didn't you know that?), that's for you. Otherwise, it is better to watch something else. But I must admit that DL is very good in this flick.

P.S. Only an idiot or a completely ignorant person would describe this thing as ""a great portray of how the Soviet Union is, with their communism."" I was born in SU in 1981 and can answer for my words, although being in no way fan of Soviet system.",1110067200,8,1210,4.545871559633028
