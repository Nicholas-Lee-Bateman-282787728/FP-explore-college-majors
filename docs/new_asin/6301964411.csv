It was one of the films my son grew up with and still loves, one of those we go back to when we're wanting a feel-good movie.  It is alternately silly, tender, ludicrous and suspenseful, but it is always enjoyable.  It was extremely well done, from script to editing and everything in between.

Others have given the general story of the movie so I will comment on the actors. I thought they all preformed well and made it a fun watch for the evening without taxing my brain. This was from a VHS tape and was very good color wise and clear viewing. I would recomend this for a fun evening. A little gory and some swearing so parents check it out before letting young children watch.",1204156800,,549,4.140186915887851

You get to liking Edwards' ungainly school teacher right off the bat, and when Gossett's grizzled bounty hunter makes his appearance, you are certain that the movie will deliver big entertainment...

And then the pixellation issues begin. Depending on which copy of the DVD you get; the screen image will begin to pixellate as early as chapter 2 or as late as chapter 4, finally locking up completely no later than early in chapter 4 (and I have yet to make it further than halfway into chapter 4). Of the three copies of this HBO original movie I have attempted to watch -- two copies from Amazon, and one purchased from Tower Records -- all have exhibited the exact same defect regardless of whether they are played on a DVD machine, PC/Mac, or PS2.

I'd love to watch this movie, but I am afraid that the disc-manufacturer's quality control (or lack thereof), is prepared to foil me at every turn. If you can acquire a copy free of manufacturer defects, you'll be guaranteed some fine entertainment...good luck!",1180051200,2,1121,4.77319587628866

Knowing nothing of gun play he teams up with an old gunfighter who tries to teach him the skillful art before rescuing the girl.  The adventures they have while chasing the gang down and teaching lessons is funny and entertaining.  It is well worth the time.,1167782400,,393,4.507042253521127

This movie, and dozens more that I know of, deserve much more.",1079827200,5,356,3.888888888888889
384141,4,6301964411,"I began watching this movie because there was simply nothing else on, and I like Lou Gossett Jr & Anthony Edwards. About 15 minutes into the film, I was hooked and really enjoying the ride. This is a very clever, witty, and funny screenplay, full of jokes both subtle and not, and it has a score that is nearly flawless, accentuating both action and comedy. There are a lot of laugh-out-loud moments, and some truly unique comedic situations. In many respects, the whole film reminded me of ""The Frisco Kid"" with Harrison Ford and Gene Wilder, another of my favorite Western comedies.
Anthony Edwards (Billy Ray Smith) plays a tenderfoot schoolteacher prone to falling off and accidentally shooting horses. One of his students is kidnapped by the stunningly attractive El Diablo (""Star Trek: Voyager's"" Robert Beltran,) and Edwards sets out to find the girl and bring her home. His misadventures with a band of misfit outlaws brings a lot of laughs and even some tender moments.
With only minor bad language and some blood here and there, this is a movie the whole family can enjoy. I highly recommend it, and plan to watch it again and again.",1049500800,7,1143,4.777777777777778

7817615,3,6301964411,This is not a true western.  And it's not a really a comedy either.  This is one of those movies that you are probably going to like or your not.  Anthony Edwards is a school teacher who has a student get kidnapped.  Gets help from Lou Gossett Jr. as a gunfighter in a very good role for him.  And meet up with some more inexperienced people to go after the outlaws.  Lou Gossett isi really the only one of them who has a chance.  This is a good movie to watch every once in awhile.,1488844800,,482,4.010526315789473
