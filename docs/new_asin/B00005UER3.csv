1664745,2,B00005UER3,"Did you know that the voice of Jay Jay,is some of the voices on that adult animated cartoon:Soth Park. Also this show is weird! Really weird! They look like dopey peoples heads stuck on the plane wih glue,and they talk. That's 1! Weird thing! There's another-are Savannah,and Big Jake adults,J.J and Tracy's parents? I mean Jake is old he has to be a adult so as  Savannah. And kids always calls adults ""Mr."",""Mom"",""Dad"",or rarely sir-but there first name,ahh! Also freakn' old Oscar! He's old and the kids call him Oscar his real name-but not by calln' him by his last name! Anyways,planes that are dumb have no last name-maybe a nicknmae. But a last name??!!!- Not just that it's a boring show-some kids in my class said ""My brother used to watch JayJaty when he was 3"",or""You watch J.J?""-""No,my brother""-or kids'll say ""Hit it JJ"" to Jacob-she says ""JayJay the jetplane. The first time I ever saw Jay Jay,it was 6:00. I was lookn' for somethin to watch;a computer animated software plane and his other friends. Ripp-off vide:means don't get this thing! So..? Don'T!",1074643200,,1068,4.804347826086956
1664746,4,B00005UER3,"My 2 year old son has an obsession with Jay Jay the Jet Plane, so we bought this DVD for his birthday.  He watches it almost every day, sometimes more than once.
The songs are pretty catchy, and the story lines are different than your average children's movie.  There are five different ""episodes"" as well as 4 Sing-a-Longs and those annoying ""Think About It"" moments by Brenda Blue.  Luckily, you don't have to watch those unless you really want to.  The DVD is 65 minutes long, so I wouldn't say it's short by any means.
Some of the characters drive me up the wall, Snuffy - a homely sky writing plane (with allergies?), Herky - a stuttering, wacked out helicopter, and Tuffy - a tow truck, are all quite annoying.  Tuffy, in particular bothers me, because it seems she's supposed to be Chinese, and they've given her bucked teeth and a bad accent.  It just doesn't seem very PC to me.
Aside from the annoying characters, some good life lessons are taught like helping and looking out for others, the importance and fun of reading, and helping to keep our world clean.  If your child is interested in airplanes, they will most likely enjoy this movie.  With time, you'll either learn to tune out this movie, or, worse, you'll find yourself singing along!",1053043200,4,1256,4.6008968609865475
1664747,5,B00005UER3,My son and daughter love this DVD! Jay Jay is my son's favorite character. My daughter loves Tracy and Savannah. They  watch this over and over again. This is the only place I have been able to find Jay Jay on DVD. The DVD is convenient because you do not have to keep rewinding it like a VHS tape. It is well worth the money.,1038960000,6,326,4.015384615384615

7954422,1,B00005UER3,"The Skylandia episode makes clear that there are underlying messages in Jay Jay supporting religious faith.  The kinds of messages I found in this show would  help open up any child to any manner of theological, mystical, new agey nonsense.  If you would prefer your toddler learn critical thinking, then avoid this show.  I had no idea there were religious overtones in this show until watching this episode, then searching for ""Jay Jay Religious"" on a search engine.

The Skylandia episode discusses a castle in the sky, and immediately when Jay Jay says ""I don't believe in castles in the sky because I've never seen one"", he is asked ""Do you have to see something to believe in it?""  I would actually hope I teach my children to say ""why yes, I do!"".

The final words of this episode were ""And that's when Jay Jay learned not to close his mind on things he couldn't see, and if you believe in something in your heart, it's true.""  Why not just show your 2 year old an episode of the X-files and tell him Bigfoot and Alien Abductions are real, too?

This show is probably great for people raising their child to believe in their own faith, but as a secular parent and critical thinker I find this to be a poor message to send to impressional young toddlers.  If my child believes in his heart that he will fly if he jumps off the roof, it's true?  There are much better shows for kids this age that send a message to kids to think like Blues Clues.",1165881600,,1451,4.397003745318352

7954424,4,B00005UER3,"My son loves the animation shows like bob the builder. I thought I would buy Jay Jay to try something different and he loved it! He sits there going ""WEEEEE! WEEEEE!"". He now loves planes and ""copters"" as he calls them",1099699200,,218,4.341463414634147
7954425,3,B00005UER3,"My son is 3 and a big fan of Jay Jay the Jet Plane. I purchased this DVD because it has a story we had already seen and liked, Jay Jay and the Magic Books. To those new to Jay Jay the Jet Plane, each episode features computer animated airplanes with human faces. Jay Jay and his friends have the voices of children, and ther are also ""adult"" planes who offer guidance. Human characters (not animated) also interact with the planes. Every episode features a song.

Unfortunately, after a few viewings of this video, my son became bored with it. Personally, I think the quality of the writing and human character acting is variable. Another disappointment for my son is that Revvin' Evan isn't featured in any of the stories, although he is misleadingly shown on the cover of the disk next to the two Pangabula Island stories. So, I have to explain time after time to my son that Evan isn't in the video.

Here are the stories, and some comments:

TRIP TO SKYLANDIA: Jay Jay chooses faith over logic when a dream about a kingdom in the clouds convinces him that it's real. The plane characters appear in the dream with different names and ""costumes."" This story seems better suited to one of the Inspirational Jay Jay collections, and is not a good introduction to the series because of the character name changes.

JAY JAY'S BUTTERFLY ADVENTURE: Jay Jay tries to find a winter home for Breezy the Butterfly, only to learn with relief that he already has one. Cute story with some accurate info about monarch  butterflies. Brenda Blue is annoyingly dismissive of Jay Jay's questions about Breezy--my only real gripe.

JAY JAY AND THE MAGIC BOOKS: Jay Jay and Tracy spend a rainy day at the library. Jay Jay learns that you can go on an adventure without even leaving home. Both underwater and outer space stories are included, and the featured song is very soothing. The librarian is hearing impaired, so sign language is featured. This is still my son's favorite episode.

TUFFY'S TRIP TO PANGABULA: Tuffy straps on a balloon to fly to Pangabula Island and join his friends. She can't steer so Captain Wentworth and her boat come to the rescue. Tuffy then returns the favor. This episode is marred by the appearance of Mr. Crabby, the first mate to Captain Wentworth. Mr. Crabby is supposed to be like Gilligan, but is more annoying than funny.

TUFFY'S ADVENTURE IN PANGABULA: Tuffy has a difficult time getting around on an island that has no roads. But she saves the day by rescuing the Sparkleberry tree. The premise of a sacred tree that likes to be harvested is a little overdone. The human actor in this story portrays a stereotyped Pacific Islander.",1092787200,13,2656,4.67237687366167
