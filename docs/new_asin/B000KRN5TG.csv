8445093,5,B000KRN5TG,"This is the 3rd installment of ""Agent Aika"". Never released in the US; Region 2 (if you don't own the equip. to play laser disks from every where, get it. A must for hard core Anime collecting;) No dub; No subtitles; Doesn't need them.....if you know the first two. Must be ordered straight from Japan. You won't be getting this one from Amazon Prime or Right Stuf. There are several vendors in Japan that are very good. This is one. Hang-ups (if any) will occur at US Customs. Things can get stuck there for a very long time. The vendor will give you their 'order received' & 'order shipped' dates. ""Agent Aika"" is a fountainhead of FAN SERVICE. This is the kind that 'just is'. It is omnipresent; but none of the characters are EVER aware of it. Much more profound than the more common type where the girl screeches with embarrassment and the over stimulated guy get a bloody nose.",1515801600,,883,4.490683229813665
