8377429,4,B002Q18FUI,I was trying to get a picture of the vocal chords in a DVD for my voice class.  I bought this because all the others I could find cost over $100.00.  This does the trick even today.  I just explained to the students when it was made and there was not a problem with it.  (High School)  It is quite enlightening!  Good ed film,1382659200,,325,4.0
