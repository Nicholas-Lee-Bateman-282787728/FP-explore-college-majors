Not a fan of watching baseball - too slow and boring yet I LOVE Baseball movies and this is one of the best! Baseball movies combine the best of Americana and history weaving that strange blend of characters, a storyline and the game.

494139,3,6302662591,"Review of The Natural
Hot Toasty Rag, September 25, 2017

Even if you haven't seen it all the way through, or if you saw it so long ago you don't remember it in its entirety, there are parts of The Natural that youll never forget. In the beginning, when young Robert Redford carves a baseball bat from the lightening-charred wood of a tree, the Wonderboy bat will become engrained in your memory. And I don't know of any moviegoer who doesnt immediately recognize the slow-motion home run with fireworks and Randy Newmans beautiful score in the background.

Those two scenes aside, The Natural is a classic baseball movie. Robert Redford rises and fallsand perhaps rises againas a baseball player in the 1920s and 1930s. Which means this is a perfect compromise movie, as I call it. Men will be satisfied because its a sports movie, and ladies will get to drool over Robert Redford in period piece outfits.

Three women, Barbara Hershey, Glenn Close, and Kim Basinger, are important and different influences in his life. Joining the cast are Robert Duvall as the nosy reporterare there really any other kind of reporter?and Wilford Brimley as the team manager. If you haven't seen this 80s classic by now, rent it during the last week of March to get revved up for baseball season. The music is surprisingly beautiful; youd never guess the same composer wrote the music to Toy Story. And even though hes always handsome in his movies, Robert Redford is particularly gorgeous in this one, so even if you don't like baseball, theres plenty else to fall in love with.",1506297600,,1564,4.763837638376383

494166,3,6302662591,"I'm an absolute baseball fanatic, and after reading and hearing all these great reviews about this movie, how it's the ""best baseball/sports movie ever made"", I expected a lot.  I love period pieces, really like Robert Redford, but boy, was this movie a disappointment for me.  It looked nice, but story-wise, it was ridiculous.  The ending was particularly dumb.  I really don't understand why everyone feels it's such a great movie.  For me, if you want to see the ""greatest"" baseball movie ever, see ""Pride of the Yankees"", and even though it's a bit corny in the beginning, you'll be crying your eyes out at the end.  Another great baseball movie is ""61*"", which was produced by a real baseball fan, Billy Crystal.  It's a fantastic look at the 1961 season with Mantle and Maris going after Babe Ruth's home run record.  Also worth mentioning is ""42"", chronicling Jackie Robinson's rise to the big leagues.  But ""The Natural""?  It's a nice-looking fantasy piece, but any self-respecting baseball fan knows better than to buy into its story.  Sorry.  That's just my opinion, and my personal taste.  Take it for only that.",1502409600,,1124,4.852631578947369

494202,5,6302662591,A movie sustaining a former ballplayers life from childhood to manhood with dangerous rites in between.,1496016000,,103,5.5
494203,5,6302662591,"In my growing up time in the 1950s the premier American sport of the time was baseball, baseball played from sandlot to professional. And in an easier time, a less rushed time when one had the hours to devote attention to the sport from neophyte player to avid sports fan that made sense. Although today football in all its glory and precision has taken its place I believe that one would be hard-pressed to write a book or produce a movie about the saga of any individual football player like Bernard Malamud and later Barry Levinson was able to do with the story line of the ballplayer under review, The Natural. Somehow the simplicity of picking up a ball and bat and running to some sandlot for a pick-up game evokes a lot more of the American spirit than the necessarily more organized, team-driven precision and expensive game of football.

This is the way an American sports story, maybe the best baseball story ever written played out (with due apologies to Ring Lardner and his You Know Me, Al and its wonderful sociological insights series). A fair-haired All-American boy from out in the farmlands of the Midwest Roy Hobbs, played by fair-haired All-American boy actor Robert Redford (who else in the 1970s or 1980s would be able to play the role as well) dreams the big time dream of becoming a professional baseball player with all the trimmings. A dream which ironically would include not just professional status but to be known by the man or woman on the street, by young impressionable boys too, as the greatest to ever tread the bases. He had it all, all the talent, all the desire and best of all a devastating fast ball which would cower even the great sluggers of his day like the fabled Ruth, the Babe, and the machine-like Hack Wilson. That, however, would be his downfall once he got tagged by a woman, an unstable woman who wanted to take down somebody who was either the greatest at what he did or was as with Roy going to be the greatest. So in answer to her straight-forward question about his potential status in the baseball Hall of Fame firmament he got a few bullets, a few silver bullets for his efforts. She was no rookie at that game either having wasted a couple of other wannabes but this time she capped off her efforts with a big fall from a high hotel window, End of career before it started, end of story.

Well no wait a minute it would be a very short story, although hardly an unusual one, where a prospect in any sport came up short and went back down to the dunghill from whence he came. So Roy, no longer the boy wonder, no longer with any illusions, longer, much longer in the tooth than in those first scenes but still with a mountain of talent and determination showed up sixteen years later in New York, in the bigs with a shot, one last shot at glory before he has to hang up the cleats (while the young players have visions of eternity the reality of time and younger faster talent eventually catches up with even the best). Somehow out in the boondocks some professional scout for the lowly New York Knights saw something in Roy and signed him to a contract-past unknown.

Those lowly Knights were something like the New York Mets of my youth-the gang who couldn't hit, pitch, field straight and so were mired in the cellar of the league they were in much to the chagrin of the manager-owner of the club, Pops. But get this that Connie Mack kept Roys light hidden under a bushel for about as long as he could until one day he in desperation let Roy take batting practice. Naturally the Natural banged them out of the park like clockwork and after a weird accident to the troublesome franchise player he took over the right field in order to get that last chance to produce his credentials-and win that doubting manager a coveted pennant.

Well it still would be a short uneventful story if there wasn't some greed, sex, and redemption to round the drama out. The greed came in two parts-one, Pops had under financial duress made a deal with the devil selling part of his franchise, enough to lose control of the club-unless he won a pennant. The other was the Chicago Black Sox-like gambling gag that has always followed sports and which always will in the hands of some Abe Saperstein-type looking for whatever edge he could get when putting down those big pay-out dollars. The best way to do that was to have, let us say, the star player under his wing. Especially a guy like Roy who could turn it on and off like a faucet. But big time gamblers don't get to be big time gamblers eating fancy steaks and living the high life depending on quirky unknowns so our Gus, the gambler, had two ways to try to squeeze the play. One, providing Roy with some high-end sex with Memo, played by Kim Basinger, and the other digging out the dirt on why a 35 year old guy with plenty of talent never came up on the radar before. The emissary for the dirty work was a flinty sports writer named Mercy, played by Robert Duvall, who dug deep and found out that whole sordid deal with that crazy woman who wasted Roy in that dreaded hotel room in his youth and her subsequent suicide out of the that same hotel room window. Judge Landis would not like that image of baseball splattered all over the back pages of the newspapers.

The redemption. Well one day when Roy, living that high life with Memo, was in a deep slump from not taking care of baseball business in Chicago (in Wrigley Field until recently the graveyard of many Cubs fans dreams so why not Roys) a vision in white dress showed up in the stands and the slump was over. Turned out that the lady, Iris, played by Glenn Close was Roys back home sweetheart long abandoned after Roy headed out to seek fame and fortune. Turned out too that Iris has a son, a son say sixteen years old, not living with the boys father who was living in New York (yeah, I know a weak part of the plotline). Eventually with the pennant on the line (and ownership of the Knights slipping from Pops hands) and that gambler having taken extra insurance by having another player on the team in the bag Roy had one last chance to go for glory. It was a close thing though, his favorite bat exploded on him and Iris also had to pull out the old chestnut that her boy was Roys son. You know Roy popped one out of the stadium. Yeah, Roy the All-American Boy could hit that thing. Could make that boyhood dream come true even if only for a minute. Hell most of us don't get one chance much less two. Great baseball movie.",1494806400,,6491,4.423913043478261
494204,2,6302662591,"The Natural has been criticized for being too predictable, not following the original book and a director's cut of the film could have been a perfect way to remedy this or at least put all of the controversy to rest. Unfortunately it is not.

Unfortunately the directer's cut adds very little to the story and for the most part clutters the storytelling, if this version had changed the tone of the film used original ending in the book, then I could see this being an interesting release, but it doesn't so it ends up being a lesser version of the theatrical release. The bonus features almost make this worth the upgrade, but without the original theatrical version of the film being included. I just can't recommend this release at all.

I like this movie a lot, it has a few small quirks, but overall it is a movie that is entertaining and I have watched it many times. I have never read the book, but watching the bonus features and doing a bit of research I can understand fully why some could take a disliking to this film. The film turns the original dark and depressing tale into a inspiring redemption tale. For me, the way this film is laid out the original ending wouldn't have worked. The film would have had to be completely reworked to fit the tone of the book. I enjoy all types of films, so I'm no stranger to less conventional endings. I just can't see how the original ending would have worked using the direction chosen by the screen writers. Maybe they should have changed the title of the movie so that fans of the book wouldn't have compared it to the book?

If you're interested in owning the film, buy the Blu Ray release which includes all of the extras from both DVD releases, much improved visual and audio, but uses the theatrical release in place of the inferior directer's cut. The Blu Ray can be found on the 2 disc double feature with A League of Their Own, both films include all the extras from their single released Blu Rays at a bargain price in a space saving case.",1494460800,,2003,4.452316076294278

The range of the alternative movements of throwing the ball, the designs of the era as time went by and a quality of hope for each one of us.

494671,4,6302662591,"I am a rabid baseball fan, so naturally I love watching movies about baseball.  Among baseball movies, one of my favorites has always been The Natural.  Starring Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Kim Basinger, and Wilford Brimley, this film from 1984 is based on Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel of the same name.

It's tempting to regard The Natural as just another biographical baseball movie. But this is definitely not ""just"" another baseball movie; it's an eloquent social commentary on the price of success in our great nation. The films central character, Roy Hobbs, has always possessed an uncanny ability to throw and hit a baseball better than anyone else. As a callow youth, he's on the threshold of seeing his dreams of making it to the big leagues come true. With success almost in his grasp, however, he succumbs to temptation and is shot and grievously wounded for his troubles. He is denied success, at least for a while.

But Roy Hobbs is not one to be denied easily. He is tenacious; for years he struggles to recover from his wounds and regain his lost athletic prowess, while continuing to strive toward the fulfillment of his life-long dreams.  But he finds that the road to realizing those dreams is much longer and harder than he ever imagined

First he must prove himself to a manager who doesn't want to play him. Then he must contend with a sports writer who threatens to reveal his tarnished past. And he must find the will to resist new temptations placed in front of him.  In the end, the basic question that Roy must answer is: what price success?

The central message of The Natural is as relevant today as it was when Bernard Malamud first wrote the book in 1952. The most important ingredients for achieving success in any endeavor are integrity, single-mindedness of purpose, and tenacity; perhaps the least important requirement for success is natural ability.

The Natural ranks as one of the most offbeat baseball movies Ive ever seen. I think its very  enjoyable,  although somewhat flawed.  Its certainly well acted and written, and has wonderfully designed costumes and sets. But its also a bit slow-moving and hard to follow at times. Despite its flaws, The Natural is a movie well worth seeing. Highly recommended.",1464220800,,2262,4.846753246753247

Cons: Although the movie does give the viewer a taste of the way Bernard Malamud used mythology in the original novel, the film ultimately turns the book on its head. In the book, Roy Hobbs strikes out in his last at bat, and the book ends with him sobbing. A mythic-type hero has been destroyed by appetites, seductresses and other modern-day tempters. By having the film end with a Hallmark-type scene in a wheat field, I think the director robbed the story of much of its power. For example, if Juliets plan had somehow been successful, and Romeo and Juliet ended up kissing on a beach somewhere, the bitter hatred between the Capulets and the Montagues wouldnt seem so bad. The films Roy Hobbs story is far less meaningful than the books. Its a pretty soap bubble, but it is pretty. My favorite quote from the film is when Roy says, Go pick me out a winner, Bobby.",1447200000,,978,4.5

Years later, he seizes an opportunity to have a faint echo of the career he might have had. He is determined and no temptation will derail his pursuit of his dream. One oddity of the film is the continued reference to his bad decisions, whereas for the most part his problems are the result of bad luck and bad conduct of others.

No matter what your favorite movie genre, this one has a bit of everything: romance, greed, kindness, diabolical plots, true love, selfishness, integrity, and a redemptive ending.

495512,3,6302662591,"This is a very nice film about baseball, which includes fantastic performances by great actors like Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Robert Duvall, Wilford Brimley, Michael Madsen and Richard Farnsworth. However, the mysterious element (temptresses, lightning bolts, sparking explosions) is a bit overdone, and the film seems silly in its clunky Arthurian/Greek mythicality. There are also very strange touches like Kim Basinger licking her lips, and the Barbara Hershey character somehow seems very inappropriate as a temptress. Strange. But the film is also gorgeously put together, with great settings, great camera shots, angles, lighting, and other items of technical perfection.

There are plenty of extras to this Blu-Ray disc. ""When Lightning Strikes"" (49:50) contains three mini-documentaries, the first one about the author, the second one about building the moviemaking team, and the third about the actual filming. We learn about Bernard Melamud's life and book from his daughter and biographer, how he suffered 20 years of frustration as a writer before The Natural, his first book, was published. The characters of the book recreate scenes from baseball mythology, with Roy Hobbs taking Ted Williams' number, a 9. Both are lefties. The Whammer character is Babe Ruth, of course, and he points his bat to show where he's going to hit the ball. In 1946 Bummer Riley hit a clock, like Roy did in the film, while Ray's shooting echoes that of Eddie Waitkus in real life. The film was shot in Buffalo War Memorial Stadium. They often shot during ""golden hour"", to capture the light, and filmed stadium scenes with 6,000 extras for Iris' ""golden halo"", and other scenes as well. The ""Extra Innings"" section (7:10) contains mentions of several elements in the film, such as the excessive use of slow motion, mentions the relevance of the Ryne Sandberg Game (where he hit two home runs off of the best closing pitcher in the league), and President Reagan's question about why Roy Hobbs was shot. ""Clubhouse Conversations"" (15:00) is a very long discussion by Redford, some baseball scholars, and some baseball players (including Sandberg) about the magic of the game... not very interesting. ""A Natural Gunned Down: The Stalking of Eddie Waitkus"" (17:00) is probably more interesting than the movie itself, and covers the start of his very interesting life (great mind was accepted into Harvard, but couldn't afford it) and great baseball career (initially delayed by four years in the US army in World War II), nearly cut short again by a shooting by a rabid fan; the tale is fascinating. He's considered by the FBI to be the first stalking victim. Very nice commentary from Waitkus' son, whose voice sounds a bit like a muttering Bob Mackenzie. Waitkus worked also with Ted Williams (coincidence?) at a baseball training camp for kids in his late years and died at age 53, a broken man suffering from the post-traumatic stress disorder that claimed his marriage and his health. ""Knights in shining armour - the mythology of The Natural"" (9:15) explains many of the very obvious mythological symbols in the movie, such as the mention of Homer early on, the Knights, the 16 years in exile (as Greek heroes would often endure after being prideful in front of the gods), and how Roy Hobbs' character is symbolically based on King Arthur's knight Percival, on a mission to kill the Kingfisher, while Wonderboy is Excalibur. Memo Paris is a repeat of Roy's lusty temptations, while Iris is the goddess of the rainbow, the messenger from the gods. The last bonus feature is called ""The Heart of the Natural"", which is a series of vague but rousing speeches by Cal Ripken Jr about baseball mythicism and the themes played out in the film, interspersed with scenes from the film; Barry Levinson is also on hand with comments as well, although they are closer to the actual film itself.",1422403200,,3894,5.027863777089784

495689,5,6302662591,Robert Redford has seemed to approach most of his roles with what I would just call emotional detachment. Some would argue that he is in fact a wooden actor. I was never in Redford's camp until he made THE NATURAL. His performance in that film was both stoic and heroic. But what really won me over in that film was Redford's personification of the thinking man's hero. That trait is what he really brings to this film to make it work. This film is a chess game between brain and brawn. I can't really describe the charisma that Redford brings to this role but you know that his Cheshire smirk is on the side of righteousness and his dogged determination can not be thwarted. Equally noteworthy is Jerry Goldsmith's score. Once again Goldsmith comes through both emotionally and psychologically because he brilliantly knows which buttons to push musically. It is very rare that he makes a mistake in his approach to scoring a film. There is a certain level of humanity that must be recognized and that recognition is something worth fighting for. I like this movie because it grips you emotionally and you genuinely want to see justice prevail. Robert Redford is a special talent. He is quite more than meets the eye. He brings that quality to THE NATURAL. And that is why THE NATURAL has become a classic.,1413763200,,1306,4.658008658008658

I would guess that whoever filmed this movie loves the game of baseball and loves storytelling.

Glenn Close adds the heart to the movie and allows the baseball scenes to blend and weave around Roy with excellent focus on just taking his best shot.

496021,5,6302662591,"Roy Hobbs, played by Robert Redford, is a farm boy with a hankering to be a great baseball player. And like Roy Hobbs, isn't it every kids dream to one day be a great baseball player?
Just like the good old days Roy Hobbs plays catch with his father and makes his own baseball bat called ""Wonderboy."" The story is easy for a lot of us to identify with playing baseball with friends on corner lots with a splintered bat and tattered baseballs every chance we could get.
Later in life, on his way to the big city to hopefully fulfill his dreams he's lured into the clutches of a wicked woman, Harriet Bird, played by Barbara Hershey, catches a bullet in his rib cage, and is sidelined from playing baseball. This movie has a great line-up of movie stars including Glen Close.
But nothing is going to keep Roy Hobbs down. Bound and determined the 35 year old ""rookie"" has a comeback when he's in the line-up of the New York Knights in 1939.
I like baseball stories where a star player never give up but pulls himself up by his boot straps and comes out of grass roots America to fulfill his passion to play baseball, and I give this great movie five stars.

Editorial Reviews
Nothing was going to stop Roy Hobbs from fulfilling his boyhood dream of baseball superstardom. Robert Redford stars in this inspiring fable that begins when 14-year-old Hobbs (Redford) fashions a powerful bat from a fallen oak tree. He soon impresses major league scouts with his ability, fixing his extraordinary talent in the mind of sportswriter Max Mercy (Duvall), who eventually becomes instrumental in Hobbs' career. But a meeting with a mysterious woman shatters his dream. Years pass and an older Hobbs reappears as a rookie for the New York Knights. Overcoming physical pain and defying those who have a stake in seeing the Knights lose, Hobbs, with his boyhood bat, has his chance to lead the Knights to the pennant and to finally fulfill his dream.",1393804800,,977,5.731034482758621

Being the mother of three, two of which are boys, and our family watched this movie countless times as they were growing up.  Much like so many young boys do, both aspired to be MLB players, and my oldest nearly made it, but an injury prevented him from advancing further.  However, his love of the game earned him enough in scholarships to put him through private college, and this movie was highly inspirational in that endeavor.  While he holds a Masters Degree in Marketing, he continued to follow his love of baseball and his chosen career over the past decade has been that of a high school baseball coach (Winning 3 State Div.

496410,5,6302662591,A Classic in every sense of the word. One of Robert Redford's best performances. Its a shame Richard Farnsworth spent 30 years as a stunt man before he decided to grace the screen as an actor.,1380499200,,192,4.361111111111111
496411,5,6302662591,"There are two types of baseball movies, those that attempt to tell the story of real ballplayer (such as ""Pride of the Yankees,"" ""The Monty Stratton Story,"" and ""Fear Strikes Out""), which, although often romanticized a bit, nevertheless portray the struggles and successes of a ballplayer in a realistic fashion. Then there are the baseball fantasies. These are to be enjoyed, not because they are realistic but because they capture the essence of what every baseball playing youth wishes for himself--becoming the greatest baseball player of all time.

""The Natural"" is one of the latter. Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a larger than life up and coming ballplayer, a youngster whose blazing fastball can strike out the greatest players of the game and who can consistently hit prodigious homeruns. However, shortly after reaching the Majors he is accosted in his hotel room by a woman whom he has met on the train to his big-league destination. She shoots him, and then commits suicide. (In Malamud's book by the same title this event was based on the real-life confrontation between Ruth Ann Steinhagen and Eddie Waitkus of the Phillies in Chicago's Edgewater Beach Hotel in 1948. The one difference is that Steinhagen didn't commit suicide but lived a long life after the incident, dying in 2013.) Those severely injured, Hobbs recovers, but his Major League career seems to be in tatters.

However, Hobbs never gives up. Years later, after spending years in the minors, Hobbs again surfaces on a Major League roster. At first, his manager doesn't want to play him, but, with the team in a huge slump, he gives Hobbs a chance out of desperation. Hobbs responds. The old magic comes back. The team goes on a tear, as Hobbs hits ball after ball out of the park. However, somewhat predictably, Hobbs goes into a slump late in the season at about the time the team moves into first. Soon the team is back to its losing ways. The question is whether Hobbs will regain his magic one more time and put the team on top.

Although ""The Natural"" is a baseball fantasy, it is more than a mere fantasy. It is also a story of perseverance, corruption and greed (though not on the part of Hobbs), and the value of personal integrity. It is a movie the entire family can enjoy. Though the outcome is rather predictable, it's fun to watch.",1380499200,,2325,4.764267990074441

496489,5,6302662591,Robert Redford has seemed to approach most of his roles with what I would just call emotional detachment. Some would argue that he is in fact a wooden actor. I was never in Redford's camp until he made THE NATURAL. His performance in that film was both stoic and heroic. But what really won me over in that film was Redford's personification of the thinking man's hero. That trait is what he really brings to this film to make it work. This film is a chess game between brain and brawn. I can't really describe the charisma that Redford brings to this role but you know that his Cheshire smirk is on the side of righteousness and his dogged determination can not be thwarted. Equally noteworthy is Jerry Goldsmith's score. Once again Goldsmith comes through both emotionally and psychologically because he brilliantly knows which buttons to push musically. It is very rare that he makes a mistake in his approach to scoring a film. There is a certain level of humanity that must be recognized and that recognition is something worth fighting for. I like this movie because it grips you emotionally and you genuinely want to see justice prevail. Robert Redford is a special talent. He is quite more than meets the eye. He brings that quality to THE NATURAL. And that is why THE NATURAL has become a classic.,1379635200,,1306,4.658008658008658

Men love it because of the sports connection, and the direction for this stuff was first class-you are pulling for the NY Giants and Roy Hobbs like he was your own home town hero.  Women enjoy it because they get to look at Robert Redford, see some beautiful period clothing and sets, and there is a love story going on which is also well directed.  There is also a very interesting little ""supernatural"" feel to it, as they never divulge much about the mysterious woman that has apparently been going around shooting amazing athletes with silver bullets, and then she casts herself out of her hotel window after shooting one...  An odd add-on to the story in its final form, as it is never fleshed out.  Overall, though, I felt the film was very well done and stands up to the sands of time well.  Sets and scenery were incredible and timely and felt authentic, as were wardrobe and hair, etc.  Moods were carried well with lighting and scenery, and the story is compelling on several levels.

496757,5,6302662591,"The iconic baseball movie The Natural can be viewed as a piece of schmaltzy fluff, feel-good nostalgia. Critics of the movie point to its almost-cartoonishly simple villains and heroes as evidence of this.

It is true; many of the figures who inhabit this film are starkly good or evil. No question that The Judge is a black-hat, for example; he shuns the light of day. A spider at the center of his web, he is the embodiment of the cardinal sin (or deadly passion) of Avarice.

No debate either that Glenn Close plays a good girl, despite her unwed-motherhood. If there were any doubt, it is erased by the way the film garbs her in white and light. Not only is she Roy Hobb's redemption, she is also his Madonna.

Far more interesting are the ambiguous players, like Max Mercy, The Whammer, and Harriet Bird (the lady in black), and the redeemable characters of Bump Bailey, Memo Paris and Hobbs himself. It is in the development of these smaller sinners and weaker saints that The Natural transcends the cartoon.

Max Mercy (played by Robert Duvall) is a cynic, the embodiment of Doubt. Max is convinced that he is irredeemable - and therefore, so is everyone else. Doubt is a minor, venial sin, but it is just a breath away from the deadly sin of Despair. That Max has nearly reached Despair is evident in his counsel to Hobbs, and also from his before-the-event cartoons. He has no doubt that Hobbs will take the easy downward path, because Max himself would.

The Whammer (Joe Don Baker in a cameo), like Max (in whose company Hobbs meets the famed hitter), is a venial sinner. His hedonism is just this side of the deadly sin of Gluttony - not the relatively innocent lust for good food and wine, sex, and other such bodily pleasures, but the far more grave equation of pleasure with Good. In fact, The Whammer is rescued from stepping over the brink from venial to mortal sin by a small wound to his pride: the loss to young Hobbs in a casual three-pitch contest.

The sins of Harriet Bird (Barbara Hershey) seem obvious. The lady in black murdered several other athletes, and attempted to shoot Roy Hobbs. But beyond the murders, Harriet commits the cardinal sin of Envy. She wishes to possess the fame of the athlete by removing him from life. Only Harriet will know that Roy Hobbs might have been ""the best that ever was."" Her desire is obviously twisted and sick - but all Envy is sick and twisted. Harriet Bird slips that knowledge in under our guard.

Bump Bailey, who has accepted the bribes that Roy turns down, is a classic picture of little-g greed on its way to all-consuming Avarice. Bailey wants it all: fame, fortune, a lovely woman, the semblance of virtue with the pleasures of vice. Bailey chases his final ball so fervently, he collides with an unyielding wall and dies. How explicit can a parable be?

Memo Paris (Kim Basinger) and Iris Gaines (Glenn Close) are presented as opposites. Memo dresses mostly in black. She is openly manipulative of the baseball players, though she seems to be directed by Gus (Darrin McGavin) in all she does. Her sins of lust are no greater in commission, really, than Iris's, though perhaps less innocent in motivation. Yet her major sin is Sloth. Memo does nothing productive; in fact, she sucks power and purpose away from the players with whom she becomes involved. Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) knows Memo is the problem, even if he cannot be specific. ""Some people are just bad luck,"" he warns Hobbs.

That leaves Roy Hobbs. Robert Redford plays the central figure of this morality play perfectly, as the symbol of the redeemability of man - although in the past, in his glory as a young pitcher, Hobbs was guilty of sins in their venial measure, and in the present, he begins to make the same mistakes, in the end (with Iris' help), he is able to atone for past errors and regain glory.

The classic Western virtues are also displayed in the latter half of the film. Hobbs serves justice in delivering Pop Fisher from the false partnership with The Judge; he displays fortitude and courage to return as a middle-aged rookie to the game in which he might have been ""the best there ever was."" And although his temperence is tested by the lure of Memo Paris and the fast pace of the city, in the end, he chooses the simpler life, the ranch and fatherhood.

These lessons are not preached; they are not even made particularly explicit. Yet audiences have responded - we know good when we see it. Like Roy Hobbs, we do not always choose the good we see, but we do recognize it as good.

The message of The Natural is that, even years later, we can change; we can make the better choice. Man is redeemable.",1376352000,,4664,4.5858343337334935

496797,4,6302662591,"FINALLY saw this movie this past week and for the most part, I loved it.

I can't imagine anyone but Robert Redford in the title role, he was a perfect choice for this part, in every way.

Loved the nostalgic, dream-like feeling to this movie throughout. Touching, at times heart-breaking, inspiring and with an ending that leaves the viewer feeling happy and satisfied.

One point that I think made the story less than credible was when Roy meets up again with Gus, 16 years later and Gus has no recollection of the day on the ball field when Roy struck out the Whammer. Gus was someone who didn't take losing at anything lightly and the fact that this was such a big deal at the time, it didn't seem possible that he would have no recollection of Roy Hobbs immediately, even after the years that had passed. Roy was still using the same name, still looked much the same...that part I thought could have been re-worked to improve the story overall.

If you've never seen this film and love baseball, Robert Redford or second chances of any kind, buy it! You won't be sorry.",1373500800,,1074,4.520618556701031

496854,5,6302662591,"I cannot possibly relate how much I love this movie except to say that I have seen it over a dozen times and have never tired of it.  It is a big, classic, mythic adventure...a bold, beautiful love story about baseball and a dream deferred.

Robert Redford is perfectly cast as Roy Hobbs...a man whose gift for playing baseball is phenomenal, yet on his way to make good on that goal he is waylaid by a crazed maniac, and his chance to achieve it almost never happens.  But many, many years later he reappears out of nowhere, a mystery man struggling to make a major league team equally down on its luck, and as the saying goes, the rest is history.

Redford is not the most talented actor, yet his own gifts are ideally suited to this movie. He is as gorgeous as ever, his chiseled all-American profile perfect for playing the penultimate player of America's Game when our country was still in the throes of its love affair with baseball. It's the Depression, and the Knights are so bad they're the butt of a bad bet: if they don't make the playoffs Pops Finley, their once-great manager, will lose his share of the team to a guy known simply as The Judge, a shark who cares nothing for the honor of the sport; the only team color he loves is the color of money.

The Knights' manager is portrayed perfectly by Wilford Brimley, his Yosemite Sam moustache drooped over a continual scowl.  His team is in a slump so big it mirrors the country's Depression.  They're dead last in their division's standings, and it will take a miracle for them to dig their way out. As if the odds aren't stacked steep enough against them, the rumor is the Knights have a ringer on their team...a player who's there to make sure the Judge's bet works out in his favor.  He may not even be necessary; as Pops has come to realize that the Judge is filling holes in their roster with nobodies from nowhere.

Enter Roy Hobbs.  Redford, who is best in the roles that rely not on his delivery but instead require him to be the icon he is, shines here as the Natural.  Hobbs has been paying all his adult life for a mistake he made on his way to tryouts almost two decades earlier, and the Knights are all he has left.  He is as gifted as ever, but it just may be he'll never be given the chance to display those gifts; after all, he's a 35-year old who's not even a Has Been.  He's a Never-Was, sitting the bench, hoping for just one chance to prove himself.  It's half-way through the season, and he's still warming the dugout.

So it's easy to see why on paper alone the movie has a great story to tell; yet in director Barry Levinson's capable hand, the film soon turns to sheer magic.  Levinson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Good-Morning-Vietnam/dp/B006QF61VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Good Morning, Vietnam</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rain-Man/dp/B002CNOA6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rain Man</a>) who loosely adapted his movie from the novel of the same name by Bernard Malamud (thankfully changing the ending), did a wonderful job turning his movie into a classic American tale.  So much is right here: the actors (Redford, Brimley, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Darrin McGavin, Barbara Hershey, Robert Proskey, Michael Madsen and others) are perfect.  Redford wore Ted William's number 9 as a tribute to the great player (NOTE: Ted Williams, Reggie Jackson, Roger Maris, Craig Nettles, Enos Slaughter, Bill Mazeroski and the great Bob Uecker wore it, too).  And a terrific score by Randy Newman provides just the right ""note"" in so many key scenes that it is as indelibly linked to the film as the actors themselves.

If that isn't enough, take it from me: there is scarcely a list of the Best Sports Films of All Time that doesn't just have THE NATURAL on it, but it usually fills the Number One position on those lists. It is an undeniable classic - if you haven't seen it, you must; don't think of it merely as a sports movie, but as a great American fable...a legend of great Americana.  It's a true classic regardless of genre.",1367366400,,4130,4.805084745762712

After watching this movie 100+ times, I am still entanced. For me, this film stands in the trifecta of Baseball films. For the Love of the Game, Bull Burham, and The Natural. It is also my favorite Robert Redford film.

This is not just a baseball movie, It is a great fantasy about good vs evil. The evil being the owners, who are in it for the money, and a man who loves the game for the purety it embodies. The symbolism throuout this film is bold. The last 5 minutes is as riveting as any intense thriller.

The Natural is the antithesis of the ""jaded"" nature of many of today's movies.

I do love a good cross section of movies from the 70's through the current crop (of the non-commic book variety), but The Natural sets itself apart.  It is indeed a fairy tale, but it's a fairy tale you can believe, and want to believe in.  When Kirk Gibson hit his pinch-hit home from in the bottom of the 9th inning during the first game of the 1988 World Series, my first thought was that he indeed had brought Roy Hobbs to life.

The result is a beautiful inspiring film (with an ending a little bit different than Malamud's novel); a tale of light and dark, of good and evil, of the choices we make in life -- the ones we regret, and the ones we keep paying for.

497029,2,6302662591,"A very long and boring movie about a baseball player who leaves home to seek his fortune as a ball player.  He get's shot by a young woman he meets on a train dressed in black and for no reason we know of, or he knows of, she suddenly shoots him!  No one sees him for years. That is, until he suddenly reappears... to play baseball again.  What he did in between many years, we don't know.

The film goes back and forth, and for quite a while in the beginning I didn't know what was going on. One minute in the past the next in the present.  In fact I got lost through most of the movie.  I thought the film was sort of part mystery, part weird romance, and a main character whom I never really understood. And of course, there were the usual gangsters trying to pay off the ball player who stood against them, with the usual plot of using a sexy blond to get him to throw the game. Movies like that only made sense in Film Noir. More than a film about real baseball, it was a twisted sort of wretch of film with a lot of bad hoodlums, and a strong silent type ball-player who is the center piece of the film, but unfortunately he doesn't come off like Gary Cooper.

I put films like this one away, because I'll probably never watch again.  I love baseball, but I think Bad News Bears was a much better baseball film than this twisted story.",1329436800,,1341,4.130769230769231

497094,5,6302662591,"""The Natural"" is a film about how the game should be played. Character Roy Hobbs, when young is the role-model ball player. He signs autographs for his young fans and plays the game with a passion no one had ever seen before.

For a general plot description, ""The Natural"" is about baseball player Roy Hobbs (Redford). The Chicago Cubs send for him. While on the train-ride to Chicago, Hobbs encounters ""the whammer"", who is supposed to be the Babe Ruth of the league. Hobbs is challenged by ""the whammer"" that in three pitches, he could not strike ""the whammer"" out. However, Hobbs does strike him out in three pitches.
When Hobbs arrives in Chicago, a woman he had lunch with on the train calls him. She wants him to go to her room. When Hobbs enters the room, this mysterious woman is standing there wearing a black veil. She asks him ""Are you going to be the best there ever was?"" He reply's ""yes"" and she shoots him in the stomach.
16 years later, Roy Hobbs gets called to the New York Knights. A team that is in dead last place and in desperate need of a spark plug. Due to his gunshot injury, Hobbs is a right fielder but has the best bat on the team and he must win a championship to get rid of a greedy owner.

Overall, ""The Natural"" is a great baseball drama. Some of Roy Hobbs decisions actually happen and effect real-life baseball players as portrayed in the film.",1309737600,,1377,4.396078431372549

497099,5,6302662591,"By turns elegiac, romantic, scary, sad and heroic, director Barry Levinson's THE NATURAL concerns a man sidetracked by a severe injury for nearly two decades who finally gets his chance to star in the Major Leagues, for the mythical New York Knights.

Roy Hobbs and Wonder Boy, the bat he carved from a tree felled by lightning, quickly turn the team's fortunes around, yet after-effects of an old gunshot wound to the torso may kill him before season's end.

This screen adaptation of a Bernard Malamud novel (loosely based on Arthurian legend) changes that author's dark ending to one of triumph.

Its main character has much in common with Bosox slugger Ted Williams: uniform number, batting style, wanting to be the best of all time, hitting a home run in his last at bat, etc. The shattered scoreboard actually happened at Ebbetts Field and the shooting incident was also taken from a true event, the wounding and comeback of Phillies first baseman Eddie Waitkus.

497135,5,6302662591,"As a celebration of the mythic power of baseball and its central place in the American cultural unconscious,""The Natural"" is virtually without peer in film. Although the film bathes characters and events in a honeyed light totally at variance with Malamud's dark and pessimistic source novel, Levinson's film is emotionally satisfying, if narratively improbable. Redford, at age 48, is a decade too old for the unlucky Roy Hobbs, but his waning golden boy aura combines with the dappled sunlight of the countryside and the shower of electric light particles at the film's climax to create indelible imagery. His blonde co-stars, Close and Basinger, are Janus-like romantic partners, one devoted and one duplicitous,as part of a cast which includes Duvall as a cynical sports journalist and perfectly cast Brimley and Farnsworth as the Merlin-like elders guiding the NY Knights, stand-ins for the NY Yankees and Arthur's Knights of the Round Table. Both the natural elements of light and dark, sun and rain, and the precisely rendered ambience of 1930's hotels, restaurants, baseball stadia and locker rooms are vividly realized in this Blu-ray which is a masterpiece of its kind.

497191,5,6302662591,"One of the signs of a great movie is how fast it flies by. Fine direction by Levinson keeps this movie interesting and evolving from the opening scenes of Ray as a teen, to the final sequence. I believe this is the best baseball movie, but to compare films in this genre isn't fair. You like a ""Field of Dreams, Bull Durham,"" or even a ""Bang The Drum Slowly"" for completely different reasons. But on its own merits, this movie fits so much content, paralleling baseball and non-baseball related themes by use of clever direction. Using the backdrop of a beautiful period piece with excellent costuming, superb use of color and lighting, and the best score of any baseball movie ever, the mood and feel of the era this movie takes place in is palpable (equal to The Godfather in those regards in my opinion). The feel this creates almost makes you yearn for its era's simplicity. This movie is loaded with symbolism on so many levels, the least being a very religious one too obvious to miss. But also by using mythical proportions, the movie succinctly develops Redford's Hobbs talent level before us. This is a sticking point for many, the over use of myth. If so, then why the praise for ""Field of Dreams"" as a baseball movie when there's ghosts coming from a cornfield, and the dead coming back to life? In doing so in ""The Natural,"" the lessons of morals, temptation, greed, vulnerability, integrity and others are instilled in the viewers conscience. It's deviation from the book serves this purpose well. Why this movie gets so bashed because it's not the same ending as the book I don't know. One can point to many widely accepted classics that deviate greatly from their books, but get nothing but praise. The casting is superb. These people fit their characters like a well lubed new glove. Too many to single out. Just a great ensemble. You don't compare this movie to a ""Major League,"" even a Damn Yankees, a fun movie in its own right for different reasons, and it's a musical. You watch them for different reasons. To compare which is better is just silly. But in over all content and simply being a beautiful film, I think this movie is incomparable in its genre.

Thanks to Hobbs' skill (played masterfully by Robert Redford, in his gosh-darn-it style) the team comes together and gains confidence.

That is, until he meets Kim Bassinger and all heck breaks loose.  Will Hobbs be able to save the team, win the pennant and help out Pops?  Or will the gamblers and crooked owners take the goods?  His naivete' gets in the way a lot in this film, so much so that I as a viewer are going 'dummy'! to the screen!

Quite a tale of intrigue, not enough baseball, but lessons learned in this 1984 film.  Great to see Redford, Bassinger and Glenn Close.

The director's cut adds only six or so minutes to the film, other than that, recommended two hours of your life well-spent!

497199,5,6302662591,"I can easily remember watching ""The Natural"" for the first time and for any kid who enjoyed baseball, the character of Roy Hobbs was truly inspirational!  Many people thought Roy Hobbs was a real fictional character and in some ways, he is.

""The Natural"" is a film that is an adaptation of a 1952 baseball novel ""The Natural"" written by Bernard Malamud and was inspired by the real life shooting of Philadelphia Phillies baseball player Eddie Waitkus who was a promising young star until an obsessed teenager gunned down the baseball player and nearly killing him.  The novel is also inspired by Shoeless Joe Jackson (who was one of the eight Chicago White Sox players accused of throwing their games against the Cincinnati Reds during the 1919 World Series) but the film adaptation while loyal to Hobbs as a player is completely different from the novel, as Roy Hobb in the film version is a hero and a character that continues to inspire many kids wanting to play baseball today.

""The Natural"" is directed by Barry Levinson (""Sleepers"", ""Wag the Dog"", ""Bugsy"", ""Rain Man"") and a screenplay written by Roger Towne (""Hawaii Five-O"") and Phil Dusenberry.  The film features cinematography by Caleb Deschanel (""National Treasure"", ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"", ""The Passion of Christ"", ""The Patriot"") and music by world renown musician Randy Newman (""Toy Story"" films, """"Cars"", ""Monsters, Inc."", ""Meet the Parents"" films).  The film has been released previously as a single disc DVD, a Director's Cut DVD and a gift set.  Now, ""The Natural"" makes its debut on HD via Blu-ray in April 2010.  This version is the theatrical 136-minute cut not the 144-minute director's cut.

VIDEO:

""The Natural"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1).  The film definitely looks very good on Blu-ray considering it's 26-years-old.  The film goes through various moments where you see present time and also some scenes making the film look a bit aged (intentional).  But overall, the film looks very good.  Colors are actually very good because previous Sony Pictures Home Entertainment films from the early '80s on Blu-rays in the past looked a bit DNR'd (digital noise reduction) and had this cloudy and waxy look to it.  But this time, the film includes the grain and probably very close to the original source.  The film looks fantastic as skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep.

""The Natural"" looks better than any of its previous DVD counterparts!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Natural"" is presented in English, French and Portuguese DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital.  Although the film is primarily dialogue and music driven through the center and front channels, there are scenes that utilize the surround channels such as an oncoming train, lightning rumbles, the crack of a baseball when the bat connects to crowd ambiance.  So, there is a good use of the surround channels throughout the film.

But if anything will stay in your mind from this film, it's Randy Newman's musical score (which is a recognizable score) and the final moments of the film (yes, the ultimate scene from the film ala sparks and all) which sounds fantastic via lossless.

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese and Spanish.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""The Natural"" is the greatest baseball film made so far!

I've watched many baseball films from the silents to modern baseball films and yes, as many are fun to watch and inspirational in showing team dynamics and the underdogs rising to the top.  ""The Natural"" is just the best baseball film out there.  Sure, it has elements from other baseball films, but the fact that you have a character of Roy Hobbs, who was a promising baseball player and loses it all after he is shot by a crazy woman and then 16-years later, tries to make a comeback in his mid 30's when most players have retired.  How inspirational is that?

I know that there are some who may be a bit upset that the film doesn't follow Bernard Malamud's original novel but personally, when you have a sports film that can literally show the worst that can happen in baseball or a film that can truly inspire, I am so glad that author Malamud gave Roger Towne and Phil Dusenberry the thumbs up to do what they want (Malamud was well aware that novel to film adaptations were different) and in this case, making Roy Hobbs a hero and for some people, despite being a fictional character, the bond that Hobbs had with his father to the love for the game rings true for anyone who has played or loves baseball. (Note: For those who want to know facts and fiction of baseball in relation to the ""The Natural"" can find some interesting tidbits here).

But at the same time, there is something very cool about seeing people that many consider are past their prime but yet showing us that they can still be awesome and be the best out there.  From Brett Favre, Jerry Rice, Lance Armstrong, Cal Ripken Jr. and many others who many felt were old and should retire, they continued to play their A game better than most athletes in their 20's.  ""The Natural"" is a film that no matter how man years have passed since the film was released in theaters, it will be a classic baseball film and the character of Roy Hobb, may he be a fictional character, but it's a character that many athletes can relate to.  Very inspirational!

As for the Blu-ray release of ""The Natural"", as mentioned earlier in my review, this is the original theatrical release and not the director's cut.  It would have nice if those eight minutes of extra footage was included as deleted scenes on the Blu-ray but we are getting the special features that were included from the 2007 two-disc DVD release.  But the picture quality on Blu-ray and the lossless audio along with the numerous special features makes this version the definitive version to own for now.

Overall, ""The Natural"" is a wonderful and inspiring film for so many people who love the game of baseball.  It is truly one of the greatest, if not the greatest, baseball film out there.  Highly recommended!",1270512000,,8929,4.826429980276134

I saw the NATURAL when it was new & thought then, as I still do, that this is one of the finest movies ever made. The acting, cinematography, script, sets, wardrobe, editing and scoring are near or at perfection. Like fine art, this production even gets better with repeat viewings. In the early 1920s, a young aspiring baseball player is cut down by a creepy and mysterious female assassin who stalks and murders gifted athletes. Although our hero Roy HOBBS, (played by Robert REDFORD), survives, his recovery is insufficient to permit him to pursue his big league dreams. Following sixteen bitter years, he finds the courage and confidence to return to the game and claim his spot in sports history. During this course he faces his personal demons and discovers that he longs for home and the woman from his past that he still loves. Of interest to all who love a good movie with a strong moral base, this is one of those rare films that is practically all things to all people, as it is not only a moving drama but it has a magical charm that draws the viewer in. Indeed, Roy HOBBS' skill was near ""magical"" and the scenes involving the ""Black Widow"" and her silver bullet as well as the virtuous moral code that the film espoused, elevate this entry into a class all of its own. The NATURAL is so good, that it is one of the few films that both ""chicks"" and guys can watch together and enjoy. It also contains what is perhaps the most heart warming ending to a film that I have ever seen. This should be mandatory viewing (and study) in all film school courses. On a final note, I have seen both versions and believe that the Director's cut was not necessary. If you become a rabid fan the additional details that the Director's cut has, adds to the story, though some of the ""flow"" is lost due to lulls in the soundtrack. This is Hollywood at its golden best and it leaves all other sports movies in the dust. Five out of five stars. This Gold Standard is most highly recommended!",1262131200,,2091,4.462140992167102

A baseball movie that knows nothing about the sport (Roy Hobbs is a pitcher the first time we see him and, inexplicably, a slugging right fielder the next time he's on screen) and attempts to impose a larger-than-life mythological feel on a simple story that manifestly cannot support it, The Natural is an overlong, overrated, and unenjoyable film that didn't even have the guts to follow its source novel to the dark conclusion the plot warrants.

497287,5,6302662591,"...and so does The Natural. I've become a fan all over again.

NOTE: This review concerns the 2007 two-disc DVD director's cut.

I loved the orginal version of the 1984 baseball film classic, but IMO director Barry Levinson's reworking of his own film has improved it. In his brief video introduction to this edition, he explains why he dared to tamper with success.

Levinson's recutting of the opening sequence, utilizing flashbacks with some previously unseen footage, now provides more background and motivation for Roy Hobbs' belated return to the game he excelled at in his youth. Other bits added throughout the picture have enhanced every principal actor's character and performance. It's amazing how just one added look, move or scene can change an opinion, illuminate a detail or explain something important. Another reviewer here noted that the music has been edited to be less obtrusive and declaritive; I listened closely and agree that was a good move. Thus, the new version is truer to Bernard Malamud's 1952 novel, which had a darker post-WWII point of view, but it's still the same awesomely inspiring sports film classic we fell in love with -- just a tad more realistic.

Technically speaking, this DVD hits a homer. A high-def digital transfer was made from the original print; images are clean and sharp. This has improved the detail and look of some dingy and muddy-looking scenes, like those in the Judge's darkened office. Also, the sound track has been upgraded to Dolby Digital 5:1. Now the bats crrRACK! and the crowds ROAR! Randy Newman's anthem-like theme gets the rock-star treatment it deserves and right when it should.

Other reasons to get this version include these featurettes on Disc Two:

When Lightning Strikes: Creating The Natural
Clubhouse Conversations
A Natural Gunned Down: The Stalking of Eddie Waitkus
Knights In Shining Armor: The Mythology of The Natural
Extra Innings
Heart of The Natural

Of these features, to me the best is ""Clubhouse"" which highlights Cal Ripkin, Jr.'s seasoned take (among others) on baseball as it can and should be played: with integrity. That was the lesson of Roy Hobbs' story. IMO The Natural and this documentary should be required viewing for every player every year, from Little League on up to the pros. Too many athletes are seduced by the siren calls of celebrity, money, sex and drugs; they forget about the only thing that really matters in the end.

For when the One Great Scorer comes

He marks - not that you won or lost -

497288,5,6302662591,"When I first saw The Natural in the theater in the summer of 1984, I knew I was watching a classic or future classic.  Robert Redford gives a great performance as both a 19 year old and a 35 year old Roy Hobbs.  While he does look a lot older than 19 during the early part of the movie, it is passable.  The ""middle aged rookie"" 16 years later is just 35.  I always laugh when I see and hear his manager say, ""Fellow, you don't start playing ball at your age, you RETIRE.""  Like the guy is so old!  He's only 35.  Oh well.

The entire cast gives great performances.  I especially enjoyed the performances by Joe Don Baker, Barbara Hershey, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley, Richard Farnsworth, Glenn Close, and of course Robert Redford.

Set in 1939, this is a story of a former star baseball pitcher who meets a wacko woman assassin of star athletes named Harriet Bird on a train to Chicago in 1923.  She attempts to take his life.  His injury sidetracks him for 16 years, then he comes back with a vengeance after he had basically disappeared.  When he returns to the game at age 35, he's basically written off as a ""middle-aged rookie"" immediately by his new team, the New York Knights.  He not only wows his doubters, but he becomes the biggest star in the game for less than one season.  The very injury that sidetracked him 16 years earlier comes back to sideline him once again near the end of the season when the Knights are in the thick of a pennant race.  It is at this time that his past association with the woman who tried to kill him 16 years earlier is starting to be revealed.  It makes no difference, because after he leaves the hospital he hits a dramatic pennant-clinching home run.

If you haven't seen this movie, I definitely recommend it.  It's a true classic that takes place in 1939 -- the tail end of the Depression and at the dawn of World War II.  The movie has a 1939 feel to it.  If you like a dramatic movie with a good story where the underdog (Roy Hobbs) and his underdog team prevails, definitely see this.",1246579200,,2037,4.335978835978836
497289,5,6302662591,"To say that I am a fan of this movie would be an understatement.  I was in Buffalo while they were filming it, but had no clue about the book as, even as a hard core baseball fan and baseball book fan, I had never read it.

I did read it after I saw the movie when it came out in 1984 and I am glad that the ending of the book was changed.  The overall tone of the movie would not lead you to believe that Roy Hobbs would do nothing less than what he did in the movie.

I have watched all different versions of this movie over the past quarter century and have watched in at least 40 times over the years and I love the movie more and more each time I see it.

There are only a couple things I would quibble about and, believe it or not they are all in the game AFTER Glen Close stands up.  If you listen to the commentary by the play by play broadcaster in the game (Levinson forced into extra duty), the Knights are playing in Chicago but are batting in the bottom of the inning for each home run.

Totally minor and insignificant in the total package.

The Director's cut with a the added scenes and reconstructed opening sequence is wonderful.  I love both versions, but the new version makes so much sense and fills in a few gaps.

I know that the reviews of the movie were mixed, but, like It's A Wonderful Life, ""The Natural"" has gotten better and better with age.

One final word, in my opionion, Randy Newman's score is the best movie score to grace a film.  The Natural without Newman would be un-natural.

The sports action is believable, Hobbs (Redford) is an incredible character, and the musical score is phenomenal.  Hobbs is, indeed, the natural.  He can hit the ball so far and hard that the cover has no choice but to fly off, and an entire electrical system in a stadium is destroyed with a well-placed 750-foot homerun - surge protectors and transformer boxes be damned!

497415,2,6302662591,"When I was first made aware of this new ""Director's Cut"" of The Natural, I wanted to rent it before deciding whether to buy it or not. Unable to find it for rent, I bought it. Having watched it twice (alternately with the original theatrical version DVD), I will probably toss it.

Director's Cut? Even the director, Barry Levinson, concedes in the introduction to this new version that it is not meant to replace or be better than the original theatrical version. It's merely an intriguing chance to see the movie edited to match his original vision more closely (made impossible in 1984 by post production time constraints). He makes no judgment that his original vision was better. For me, this cut is quite inferior.

Not only were 15 minutes of footage added, but 9 minutes were deleted. In the original version, the opening act (before Roy returns to the game after 16 years) ran 20 minutes. In the new version, despite a lot of added material, it runs 17 minutes. The relaxed, natural pace of the original sequence is now full of somewhat abrupt, quick edits. Gone also are some beautiful shots, such as the young Roy and Iris running towards each other at night across the horizon of a field. Gone are moments of character development, such as The Whammer's wisecrack on the train, ""Oh, first Pete and now Repeat?""

And much later in the film, one added scene derails a major theme. Iris is a positive influence, and Roy excels in the game under that influence. Memo is a negative influence, and under her spell Roy fails. Yet in this new verson of the film, Roy returns to New York after several highly successful games (under Iris' influence) on the road, and then a scene has been added where Memo welcomes him home in a hotel lobby and gets cozy with him in a phone booth. In the following scenes, Roy continues his successful run! It makes no sense. In the original version, his success ended as soon as he reunited with Memo at the welcome home party. In fact, the addition of the phone booth scene results in her welcoming him home twice, which is somewhat odd.

On the positive side, the new 5.1 sound is very nice most of the time, but sound effects that were subtle in the original film have been amped up at times to the point of being distracting. Originally, the two gunshots sounded appropriate to the rooms in which they happened. They now sound like recordings of shots in an echo chamber, edited into the film. Still, I have to say I loved the enhanced sounds of thunder throughout the movie.

The second disc of Special Features has some interesting stuff on it. So I'll keep the Special Features disc, put it with my DVD of the original theatrical version, and toss the so-called Director's Cut disc. But I will miss those great thunder sounds.",1200096000,,2771,4.58989898989899

It represents a considerable touch of nostalgia, especially for those of us who recall such times as those presented here.  But it is also a rush of emotion, from a number of perspectives, for viewers of any age.  For example, have any of you ever been reunited with your first love, after many years?  It is a prominent theme in the story, and it will play a tune on your heartstrings.  True, there appears to be a more or less supernatural presence in the story, but in no way does it detract from the quality of the story or the film itself.

As others have said, the cast itself is unbeatable, when you consider the thespian excellence represented in Robert Redford, Glenn Close, Wilford Brimley, Kim Basinger, and the inevitable class and elegance of Richard Farnsworth.  When bridging the sixteen years duration of the story, the filmmakers did a masterful job of gracefully ""aging"" the cast.

The Director's cut includes some small clips that do not appear in the usual commercial release, but in many ways, I do not understand why they were not included as a matter of policy.  In fact, these vignettes lent clarity and completeness to some later scenes.

497474,5,6302662591,"This ain't the Malamud novel put on screen.  Yet this movie is very effective in its own right.  While inspired by the book (many scenes are pretty much out of the book), there is a very different sensibility.  The book is a kind of morality tale, with a dark view of the human condition.  The movie, after an elegaic beginning, also gets dark--but then ends with a dramatic moment and a touching, affecting close.

There are mythical moments in the movie that are most catching--the lightning bolt and the cover coming off the baseball, breaking the clock at the stadium, the climactic closing baseball moment in the film.

Roy Hobbs, though, isn't superhuman, although he is less prone to human foibles than his namesake in the novel.  He is human and very talented.  His life went haywire when he went to try out for a major league team early in his life(with a contract in his pocket).  A meeting with a mysterious woman derailed his baseball career for many years.

He comes back in his 30s and has a brief moment of glory, suggesting what could have been if things had worked out differently.

Thus stated, this sounds like a sad movie.  But the ending, bringing a family back together after a dramatic moment in the playoffs, provides an upbeat ending, testifying to the possibilities that our hopes can be realized.

Robert Redford's acting style plays well in this movie. Glenn Close provides an affecting counterpoint to Kim Basinger's Memo Paris and Barbara Hershey's mysterious woman.  Darren McGavin is wonderful as the gambler and Robert Duvall as Max Mercy, the sports writer. Wilford Brimley is terrific as the gruff old manager. Good acting; nice special effects; wonderful cinematography by Caleb Deschanel.

497541,5,6302662591,"""The life we learn with and the life we live with after that."" -- Glenn Close

This beautiful film about a dream derailed by a dark fate which takes the form of two outwardly lovely but inwardly unbalanced women has my vote for the greatest baseball movie ever made. Director Barry Levinson and screenwriters Roger Towne and Phil Dusenverry turned Bernard Malamud's novel into a meaningful fable that transcends baseball and encompasses life itself.

Robert Redford is Roy Hobbs, whose only dream is to walk down the street one day and have people say: ""That's Roy Hobbs, the best there ever was."" Roy's dad on the farm instills in his son the love for baseball, recognizing in him an extraordinary gift like none before him. When he passes suddenly, young Roy fashions a bat from a tree struck by lightning and the mythic elements of the story begin to take shape.

Glenn Close is wonderful as Roy's sweetheart. She is pure of heart, with no agenda other than Roy's happiness. She is the light of his youth and his life, and will bring him back to his destiny, in contrast to the twisted agenda of two other young women. Levinson smartly dresses Close in white, and both Barbara Hershey and Kim Basinger in black, to contrast the good and evil bidding for Roy's fate.

When a dark episode in a hotel room nearly ends Roy's life, 16 years pass before he returns to baseball with the New York Knights. Scoffed at by Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) at first, he and his assistant, Red (Richard Farnsworth), finally give Hobbs a chance and soon he and his bat, ""Wonder Boy,"" take on a mythic quality. But a reporter named Max (Robert Duvall) is bound and determined to discover the secret of those 16 missing years and destroy Roy's chance to be the best there ever was.

It is more than just Max trying to derail his dream, however. Beautiful Kim Basinger is Memo Paris, whose outward appearance can only mask the stone cold part of her heart for so long. Roy almost sees it too late, but when he does, utters the now famous line: ""I was wrong Memo. We have met before.""

It will be Iris (Glenn Close) who once again acts as Roy's shining light, her kindness and decency and understanding giving Roy strength to have one last go at his dream. She will act as his lighthouse in a storm of dark fate and unbalanced young women, guiding him full circle back to a farm and a life still full of dreams.

This director's cut not only has an additional 15 minutes of film, but it looks and sounds better than ever. The extras are really special in this set. Not only do you get an ""autographed"" Roy Hobbs baseball, and Roy Hobbs' rookie cards, but a blue New York Knights baseball cap as well. If, like me, you are a fan of this magical film, you'll want to grab this up before they're all gone, just as I did.

This film is for anyone who ever dreamed of being the best there ever was and had those dreams derailed for a time by something they didn't see comin'. It doesn't matter if that dream was of baseball, carpentry, or writing. Perhaps that is the magic of this film. This is a lovely period piece, beautifully shot. Because it is about so much more than just baseball, it is the best baseball movie there ever was......",1178064000,,3216,4.466780238500852
497542,4,6302662591,"I loved the Natural when it came out in 1984.  The mythical quality of the story, terrific acting by a perfect cast, great editing, and great direction made this film one of my all time favorite sports movies.

So this year a new dvd version is being released that is being called the Director's cut.  Apparently there are 20 minutes of new footage added in, but the editing results in a film that is only 6 minutes longer than the original.  The chief difference between the two versions is that the backstory is relayed primarily through flashback from the ""present"", as Roy Hobbs returns to his childhood home after 16 years away.  He retrieves ""Wonder Boy"", then goes to New York to start his career with the NY Knights.

The new version works okay, but I frankly preferred the original.  I preferred its slightly more deliberate pacing, and I don't think the new scenes (primarily extended versions of already existing scenes) added any real value or perspective.  Indeed, one scene in which Memo travels to meet Roy on the road actually detracted from the cohesion of the story.

Bottom line:  if you loved the original, you'll like this one.  It's still basically the same film.  I just don't think it needed any tinkering.",1176163200,,1230,4.723004694835681
497543,5,6302662591,"This film has been recognized as a phenomenal use of lighting technique and light/dark metaphor.

But for me, this film is important to us for its retelling of one of the fundamental Homeric myths of our culture, the Iliad, where King Ullysses, which in Greek means ""wounded thigh"" (or one who travels slowly home) struggles to return to his island kingdom after great loss of time and friends and especially a home life in the process. Sound familiar?

Bernard Malamud translated ""King"" to ""Roy"", ""limps"" to ""Hobbs"", distracting ""Psirens"" to ""Memo"" and ""Harriet Bird"", and the Odyssey tale of hubric war to the mythic era of late 1930's American baseball.

The deep and deeply hidden psychological aspect of both stories (and in a comic facet of the same story ""Oh Brother, where art thou?) is as Glenn Close's (Ulysses' waiting wife Penelope) character says, ""I believe we have two lives- the one we learn with, and the one we live afterwards"".

This is a phenomena many people experience, what Carl Jung called ""the second half of life"", when we do live with the life we have finally learned. It has been said that there are really only two stories- struggling to love and struggle to get home. Ancient Homer, 40's Malamud and 70's Levinson all have braided the two stories together well.",1176076800,,1291,4.801801801801802

497546,5,6302662591,"""There goes Roy Hobbs, the best there ever was to play this game."" For admirers of the original theatrical and, later, DVD version, of ""The Natural"" this is obviously A MUST. The story of Roy Hobbs, a great young talent in the Ted Williams mode (they even share the same number - 9), struck down in his prime, and then, like a phoenix, reborn into athletic glory, is one of the classic American stories of all time, based on the fine novel by Bernard Malamud. This new ""Director's Cut"" version is like revisiting a great fairy tale from childhood and being given more - and often longer - scenes with some of your favorite characters.  Director Barry Levinson explains, in a video introduction to the film, the reasons for this new edition: how the original film was somewhat rushed into theatres and how he and his editor (and others) wanted a much different first act to the film.  And here it is: the new footage deepens and darkens and gradually brightens the film into a much more satisfying experience and still does not diminish the impact of the original at all. In a word, PERFECT. The musical score, by the great Randy Newman, perhaps a little too insistent in the original film, cueing us to how we should feel, sneaks up on you more in this version and makes all the wonderful moments in the film that come later that much more moving.  Also, Robert Redford's performance as Roy Hobbs is immeasurably helped here: the new footage (often original scenes with more footage added), even certain quick cuts, make for a more layered, textured performance that gives us greater insights into this troubled, but noble character - and show how a once, great, guileless young ballplayer still exists inside the older, careworn, but still talented, man he has become. There are beautiful moments restored here - often wordless - and some original scenes have been edited, so that even though there is additional footage, the new version only runs about six minutes longer than the original.  Personally, I felt all the performances benefited from the new version - Robert Duvall, Kim Basinger, Darren McGavin, Glenn Close, Wilford Brimley, Richard Farnsworth, all doing splendid work here. And though my only quibble with the film was - and still is - the somewhat stilted staging of some of the scenes (I would have liked to have seen more reactions from the ballplayers and coaches during games - sometimes they just look blank even when watching something exciting going on), this is clearly a TRUE classic - and the new version will only add to its glory.  The additional special features include a wealth of information about the making of the film, and a splendid featurette on ""The Mythology of The Natural.""  Clearly this is why this film endures - and will for the next 100 years.  It has a timeless feel, from the perfect performances, the superb direction, the obvious care that was taken in the music, costumes, sets (the fantastic scenes in the various ballparks), and, finally, to the story itself, so beautifully articulated by Glenn Close's character later in the story: ""I believe we have two lives: the one we learn with, and the one we live with after that.""  This new DVD ""Director's Cut"" version drives this theme home with the precision of one of Roy Hobbs's mammoth home runs. It is a darker, more textured, but ultimately more illuminating experience (and perhaps even more moving than the original version) - and one of Barry Levinson's finest achievements. I wish they had re-released it on the big screen first. But here it is in a beautifully packaged DVD (with a great, old-fashioned cover), worth every penny, and then some.

497615,3,6302662591,"Obviously a feel good sports movie with lots of supporters and fans, `The Natural' is one of those movies I'd been told about, been told to watch but never had the desire to do so.  Last night though, my wife and I decided to give it a try, and while I will agree that it is just that, a feel good sports movie, I was left less than impressed.

Roy Hobbs (Redford) wanted to play baseball since he was a young boy, and he was always a natural, a very talented athlete.  Right before he was able to break into the majors though, he was shot and ended up `sidetracked' for fifteen years.  All that time has passed and he mysteriously shows back up in an attempt to finally play major league ball.  He's picked up by the New York Knights, reluctantly, but soon proves his weight with the help of his trusty bat `Wonderboy'.

What Roy soon learns is that the team he was sold to is in trouble.  The owner of the team, Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley), has entered into a forced agreement with The Judge (Robert Prosky) that if the Knights don't make it into the World Series then Pop will have to sell his share to The Judge, but if they do win the Pennant then Pop will own the team in full.  The Judge is soon frazzled by the appearance of Roy and is soon trying to bribe him to throw the final game, losing the Pennant.

The cast is quite strong, but the script is fluff at best.  It's a bit corny at many moments, especially how Roy can disappear for fifteen years and then reappear with absolutely no one knowing what happened to him, not even his one time fianc Iris (Glen Close).  Robert Redford is fine, not great, no where near as good as he's been before, but it's truly Robert Duval and Kim Basinger who steal the show with their turns as the reporter and the woman that get too close.

I probably won't watch this again, it's not strong enough of a film for me to care enough to rewatch.  I can see why baseball buffs and family film pioneers love this film, but if I'm going to be completely honest with myself and with the average viewer, this really isn't a film that's worth all that much attention.",1165449600,,2107,4.25062656641604

It really gives you that feel for baseball and why people dedicate their lives to it, in whatever capacity. The color and camera work captures the feel of baseball in yesteryear. So much of this story is told without detailed dialogue- a sign of a great movie. And so many words of wisdom - truisms, are uttered so casually that if you miss them, you miss so much of the very essence of this film. Redford is perfect as Roy Hobbs, as is Wilford Brimley as manager of the lowly New York Knights. But Robert DuVall and Kim Bassinger play great supporting roles, as do the rest of the supporting cast members, many who will be familar character actor faces. I never read the book, but know that those who have take umbrage to the license the movie takes with the story and how they present it. If you haven't read the book that won't affect you. What will affect you is Levinson's direction and the feel for the era he creates with the simplicity of the dialogue, the cinematography, and the color and lighting used, not to mention Randy Newman's period setting musical score, which is magical in setting the necessary moods. You feel like you're in another era. This Natural also contains my favorite quotes in movie history, when Glen Close utters, ""I believe we have two lives- the one we learn with, and the one we live with after that."" That quote embodies this film, and is my credo. Redford's hospital bed quote of ""some mistakes we never stop paying for,"" also is quite profound. A great movie with a great ending, that was almost reenacted in the 1988 World Series with Kirk Gibson's magical game winning home run in game one against the Oakland A's.

497622,3,6302662591,"`The Natural' released in '84 serves quite well as a nostalgic sports tale, underscored love story and thinly disguised morality play.

Plot: Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) could've been the greatest professional baseball player of all-time if not for one bad decision he made while on his way to spring training. A one night fling aboard the train taking him to try-outs ends horribly in a near fatal injury to Roy and the suicide death of his woman of mystery.

Roy fights his way back from the injury and bad press, paying his dues in the minor leagues until he finally gets another chance to prove himself against the best. However quite a few years have now passed and Roy isn't the young man he used to be, or so the coaches and players keep telling him. Will they give him a chance to prove he's still one of the best there ever was? If they want to have a chance at winning the pennant they'd better.

Redford delivers another one of his leisurely, low-key, verbally challenged performances, leaving it up to the rest of the cast to provide the necessary energy and emotion to carry him and the plot to its inevitable conclusion. Glenn Close plays Roy's love interest Iris and Robert Duvall turns in a strong performance as hardnosed sports reporter Max Mercy. However both roles are surprisingly small for stars of such high caliber and seem to be ill-used as nothing more than interested observers instead of integral characters in the plot.

As far as I'm concerned the standout performance in this film is delivered by Darren McGavin in the role of unscrupulous gambler Gus Sands. Sands believes everyman has his price and is determined to find out what it takes to buy Hobbs services, thereby controlling the outcome of the baseball season. The only time Redford comes alive in this film is when he's actively engaged in conversation with Gus.

497674,5,6302662591,"This is THE classic sports-Walter Mitty-fantasy movie, with an ending that may seem corny to cynical critics or those who prefer the book, but was perfect for me and a lot of other people.

Granted, I am a little biased in my review since the movie was made in the area in which grew up. Having made many trips to the ballpark in which the movie was filmed, and to the old-fashioned soda shoppe where Robert Redford and Glenn Close re-unite, this movie was special to all of us in Western New York. I

I think I would have loved this movie regardless of the ""home-field advantage."" It's an interesting, involving story that has you really rooting for Redford's character. To have actors like Close, Robert Duvall, Richard Farnsworth, Kim Basinger, Wilfred Brimley, Darren McGavin, Barabara Hershey, Robert Prosky, Joe Don Baker and others in the ""lineup"" doesn't hurt, either!

The cinematography is beautiful, too. That was something I never really appreciated until after several viewings. There are some wonderfully subdued brown and golden hues in here. This is very pretty motion picture.

All the characters - the good and the bad, and there are plenty of both - are fascinating. It's also nice to see an actor in a baseball film that actually knows how to throw, hit and field a baseball. This is a great, old-fashioned storytelling.",1145404800,,1340,4.8384279475982535
497675,1,6302662591,"I am absolutely baffled by all the positive reviews for this film. I can't even count all the things I dislike about it, but I'll list a few:

1. Redford is way too old for his role.

2. Ditto Glenn Close. And not nearly attractive enough, either.

3. How did Roy go from being a prodigy of a pitcher as a teen to being a prodigious power hitter later?

4. The mythic hits by Roy are ludicrous. How in the heck can you hit a foul tip harder than anyone else, so that it shatters a pressbox window? And the climactic homer near the end -- what's with the broken lights raining sparks for what seems like 10 minutes? Not to mention the fact that the sparks shower down on the basepaths, which are about 300 feet away from the lights.

5. The ""home run music"" was okay. Just okay, not so great that it has to be used over and over, ad nauseam, at half the ballparks in the country.

Very, very mediocre film, at best. Again, I just don't understand why people rave about it.",1142380800,,971,4.165775401069519
497676,4,6302662591,This is the kind of movie to watch whenever you're feeling a little depressed. It has the ability to lift anyone emotionally throughout. The soundtrack was especially uplifting at the final ballpark scene. Robert Redford was exceptional in his role. A keeper for any collection.,1140480000,,278,5.2
497677,5,6302662591,"I cited to this in a recent review and said it was the best sports movie I ever saw. So I pulled it out of the collection and watched it again. I realize now that I may have done it an injustice. Yes, for this reviewer it is a great Sports movie with all the details and trappings of professional sports, the femme de guerre, money changers and interesting characters following the sports carnival, probably since olympic wrestling in Sparta and Macedonia in 400 BC. But like Rocky (One for God's sake) and Cinderella Man, it's really more about life.

Like Jim Braddock and Rocky (again, there's only one), Roy Hobbs could have been the greatest. Terry Malloy has an interesting line in ""On the Waterfront"" (Brando). He tells his brother Charley Malloy (Steiger) ""I coulda' been SOMEBODY.""

Well Hobbs missed the boat. But when he surpresses (you can't kill the bastards, you just chain them up) his demons, he shows up on the stairs of the dugout to Wilfred Brimley's ""dead from the neck up"" major leauge ball club. It's the 1930's but baseball, remarkably, is baseball. Brimley tells Roy ""guys your age are retiring, not in their rookie year.""

Suspecting that management is involved in a conspiracy to sink the team even further, Pops tells Richard Farnsworth  his dugout coach 'but I ain't gonna play him.'

Roy Hobbs can't pitch anymore but he can hit the stuffing out of the ball (he actually does) and Farnsworth intercedes for him with Pops and sticks him in the lineup. With a lot of great scenes in this Levinson masterpiece one of my favorites is his first time up. He takes a ball and the ump calls it a strike. And Roy mutters, 'no it's not.'

A great movie with a near mythic analogy. Hershey and Bassinger are the evil women sent to derail Hobbs. You think of Homer warning Odysseus to avoid the sirens on the shore. Glenn Close is almost saintly. When she stands up at what will be the end of his slump at Wrigley Field and the light is incandescent around her head, hell, you think you too are having a religious experience.

The conversations between Brimley and Farnsworth are worth the price of admission. And Farnsworth is like a soothsayer in the ancient greek plays. Retribution. Amending. Sorrow. Dismas. Second chances. Loyalty. Love conquers . . . . yeah, you guessed it. My favorite. Because Redford always brought a sense of quiet intensity (Condor, All the President's Men) we forget sometimes that in his own right he produced and directed close to 30 films beyond appearing in movies as an actor. 5 stars.

497678,5,6302662591,"You do not have to be a fan to enjoy this special baseball fantasy, but it helps. I noticed the movie packaged with another fantasy - ""Field of Dreams.""

This is the kind of baseball we lifetime fans remember, or think we do. Before the overpaid, sullen stars like Bonds, etc.

Back around the 1930s, back before cable television and the Internet.

When you could smell the grass, and feel the well-oiled leather gloves, as well as special sturdy bats (no cork.)

Robert Redford is perfect as the aging, mystery slugger, who struggles against the establishment, and all its temptations, to get to the big climax of a game with everything on the line.

A night games just dripping with drama, the bottom of the ninth, the kind of situation we used to imagine when we were young, daydreaming and clutching our Mickey Mantle and other baseball cards.

We'd close our eyes and say ""Oh, if I only could come to bat in a situation like that, the game, the season on the line.""

Forget about some of the holes in the screenplay --who cares?

The entire movie works, and leads up to the ending. The ending --I've seen it over a dozen times and thoroughly enjoy it each time. I feel like Bobby, the bat boy (who should have won a supporting Academy Award) right there close to Redford's Roy Hobbs, as all the forces in the Universe converge on that old ballfield for the big Ba---Room!

Get the movie, pop a lot of popcorn and wear a baseball cap. Enjoy! I know you will.",1133827200,,1462,4.466165413533835
497679,5,6302662591,"Whenever I tell people how much I cherish The Natural, I often get the ""do you still believe in the Easter bunny"" look. Occasionally someone may throw out a dig about Robert Redford, but, even though I'm not a fan, I have to give him his due because he's so authentic in this role.

Yes, I suppose we could criticize this grand tale for several of its melodramatic conversations and scenarios. We might also wonder as to how ""major league"" teams continued to pitch, as opposed to intentionally walk, a guy consistently shattering the infrastructure of ball yards and sporting a batting average around .500. However, from the very beginning, we are made aware that this is a tale of fantasy and that it is necessary to  suspend our disbelief.

The cast is superb and it isn't just the stars who glimmer. Wilford Brimley's Pop and Richard Farnsworth's Red are quite special. The chemistry between them is superb and both are extremely believable in the role of baseball old timers. Like Hobbs, they are remnants from a rural, simpler age that is no more. Pop even repeatedly wishes that he would have become a farmer rather than gone into baseball.

Kim Basinger plays Memo ""I've known a million guys"" Paris who, along with Barbara Hershey, are the embodiment of the femme fatale. Both are horrendous, and near lethal, influences on Redford. As Basinger's romance with the right fielder escalates, his performance on the diamond declines. In few situations in life or fiction are characters as black/white and good/evil as they are here. The Madonna/whore dichotomy has never been more apparent (outside of The Bible) as Glenn Close's Iris can be perfectly juxtaposed with the two Jezebels. She is as pure as Holy Water. Redford's sincerity in regard to her cannot be questioned. Indeed, he says, ""Are you married?"" seconds after being reunited with her after. When he looks at Iris, Redford's mind is fixed on only one thing: lifelong devotion.

As far as classic moments in film go, I can think of few as touching as when the camera catches Pop's expression as Roy Hobbs runs the bases while, in his glasses, we see the bursting of stadium lights. Few experiences are as rewarding as helping another when you are the only hope they have left.

The Natural is a marvelous antidote to societal reserve and restraint; even if it only lasts a few hours. It's cleansing to cheer for characters who lack a dark side, and inspirational to watch them trounce the bad guys.",1121990400,,2464,4.785882352941177
497680,5,6302662591,"The story of a one-time baseball prodigy getting a second chance to participate in the sport he loves couldn't have been better presented for the screen than in ""The Natural.""  I have heard griping from fans of the novel on which the movie is based, but I never read it, so I have nothing to complain about.

  Mostly set in the 1930's, this film portrays baseball when it was truly America's favorite pass-time (although some will say it still is).  Sterroids and cork-enhanced bats are nowhere to be found in this movie, and the absence of these things gives baseball a sense of purity that is harder to find today.  ""The Natural"" is a home run of a film that can be enjoyed even by those who don't like baseball.

  At the beginning of the film, baseball ""natural"" Roy Hobbs is on his way to a tryout for a major-league team.  He leaves behind his childhood sweetheart, whom he promises to marry in the future.  On the way, he shows flashes of talent when he strikes out baseball legend ""The Whammer"" at a local fair.  Sportswriter Max Mercy witnesses this event, and he is all set to aid Hobbs on the road to fame.  Unfortunately, a seemingly-unstable woman shoots Hobbs in his hotel before he even gets to try out.  Supposedly gone are Hobbs's dreams of being ""the best there ever was...""

  Sixteen years later, with the help of a special bat nicknamed ""Wonderboy"", Roy Hobbs finally gets his chance to make a name for himself in the majors.

  Robert Redford leads an all-star cast as Roy Hobbs.  The movie is mainly about Redford's character, so he is given the juiciest scenes, which is good, because Redford is perfect in the role.  Robert Duvall is equally perfect as Max Mercy, the sportswriter who constantly runs into Hobbs.  Kim Basinger, Glenn Close, and Richard Farnsworth are only a few of the actors/actresses featured in this movie.  The photography is terrific, and Randy Newman provides a wonderful musical score.

  My favorite scenes in the movie include:

  -The first glimpse of Roy Hobbs, as a kid, catching a fly ball in a field by his farm.

  -Hobbs's first major league hit, a triple, where he knocks the cover off the ball with ""Wonderboy"".

  -Hobbs's home-run against the Chicago Cubs, where the ball shatters the clock next to the scoreboard.

  -Hobbs's last game (I told you Redford had all the best scenes), where he hits a home-run (without ""Wonderboy""!) and the ball hits the lights and they explode like a giant fireworks display.

  Special features on the DVD include a unique, exclusive documentary featuring words from Cal Ripken Jr. and director Barry Levinson.  The theatrical trailer is also available.  The movie itself presents great picture and sound.

497681,3,6302662591,"A so-so movie, especially when compared to the novel by Bernard Malamud. The plodding Robert Redford plays an aging ballplayer, Roy Hobbs, who years before showed great promise as a rookie, but had that all go down the tubes when a woman shot him in the stomach. So now, recovered, he's hired to play on the crummy NY Knights, whose owner has secretly bet they'd lose. When Redford does good and the team is on the verge of winning, he has him poisoned. But, of course, Redford drags himself to the plate near the end of the deciding game and hits a thunderous homerun that shatters the lights of the stadium.

Malamud believed that baseball was America's great myth, and he stocked his novel with all sorts of mythological elements: the hero coming through against adversity, the ""magic"" bat called Wonderboy (think Excalibar), the great final feat. But unlike all great heroes (at least in fiction), Redford doesn't die at the end (in the novel Hobbs does die), but instead gets the girl. Hollywood strikes again.

497750,5,6302662591,"Nominated for four Academy Awards, The Natural is one of Robert Redford's best pictures. The breathtaking cinematography, coupled with the bold original score by Randy Newman, makes The Natural one of the most memorable films of its time. A classic baseball film, based on the best-selling novel, the movie has managed to insert itself into the pop culture. Certainly no little league player, nor major league player for that matter, can escape the sounds of Roy Hobbs and his mystical abilities when stepping into the batter's box with the game on the line... The Natural is quite simply one of the best baseball films around - up there with Field Of Dreams, Eight Men Out, and Major League...

Written more like a fairy tale than a modern drama, The Natural follows the life and times of Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford), a man trained from his earliest days to love the game of baseball by his father. When the boy's father dies of a heart attack on the family farm, Roy uses the wood from the lightning-felled tree under which his father died to fashion a homemade baseball bat. In love with the girl next door, Iris Gaines (Glenn Close), Roy leaves the farm after promising to come back to her in order to pursue a tryout as a pitcher for the Chicago Cubs. But Roy never makes it back...

Mysteriously shot by a woman he meets in a hotel room, Roy's career is nearly ended by internal injuries. When Roy reappears twenty years later as a forty-year-old rookie for a last place team, he faces opposition from the team coach Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) who believes his business partner, The Judge (Robert Prosky), is intentionally sabotaging the team in an effort to cheat Pop Fisher out of his ownership shares. But when Pop Fisher finds out that Hobbs can not only play, but is the best player to ever set foot on a baseball diamond, the team's losing ways are put to an end - at least until Hobbs decides to complicate his life further...

Involving himself with Pop's niece, Memo Paris (Kim Basinger), Roy finds the level of his game dropping off. Despite Pop's warnings, Roy develops a relationship with the girl who is in partnership with the Judge to keep the team stuck in its losing ways. However, when Iris reenters Roy's life (along with her teenage son), Roy's play begins to pick up. But the championship is in jeopardy when a familiar reporter, Max Mercy (Robert Duvall), comes dangerously close to uncovering Roy Hobbs's mysterious past and internal bleeding threatens the life and career of the game's greatest slugger...

Sporting a different (Hollywood-ized) ending from the novel which spawned its release, The Natural is nonetheless one of the most inspiring, feel good movies of all time. The 1930's setting, and the seemingly one-dimensional characters, create an innocence of times past that make this movie seem like a flashback to the Frank Capra era. The musical score will create a literal tingling in your bones, and the hero-wins screenplay is one to be appreciated in this era of cynic realism. All these aspects of the film work together to make The Natural one of the most entertaining films around as well as earn it the designation of a must-see film... Pop this one into the DVD player and go live the magic!

Robert Redford attended the University of Colorado on a baseball scholarship.

497754,5,6302662591,"I have not read Bernard Malamud's novel on which this movie was based; I will admit that I have no desire to do so, as I have heard how it differs from the movie, and I am convinced that this movie is the only correct way the story can be told.

In a big country like the United States of America, we need big heroes, bigger than life, Achilleus-like in scope, touched (or at least favored) by the gods.  Fairly or unfairly, since the dawn of the 20th Century, we've tended to select such heroes from the world of sport, traditionally from baseball, a game which, due to such much of it having been played before the advent of mass (or even general) media coverage, seems better given to legendary, even mythic historical representation.

The heroes from baseball's past consistently shade those of its present; the names of Ruth, Williams, Mantle, Mays, (Walter) Johnson are men whose accomplishments seem more and more impossible as time leaves them further behind...and as their successors consistently disgrace their legacy by self-centeredness, greed, and scandal -with the notable exception of Curt Schilling bleeding most ""Natural""-like as commented by Bob Costas on the pitcher's mound while pitching the Red Sox to victories in Yankee Stadium and the World Series in the 2004 postseason.

In ""The Natural"" we have a mythical story of a fictional team, the New York Knights, a moribund franchise seemingly based on any of three traditionally bad teams, the old St. Louis Browns, the Washington Senators, and/or the Philadelphia Phillies.  This team has nothing going for it; their star player (""Kill Bill"" and ESPN's ""Tilt"" star Michael Madsen) is a whining prima donna, their manager (Wilfrod Brimley) is believed to be ""jinxed"", and their owner has just signed a 36-year old (well...a hard-living 36 if Redford's wrinkles are to be believed) with the intent of finishing last in order to bilk the manager out of his ownership share of the team.

But Redford's Roy Hobbs isn't the has-been/never-was he is taken for; he is ""The Natural"", the one for whom The Game seemingly was created.  From an early age he displayed an uncanny knack for the game, a ""phee-nom"" of a lefthanded pitcher who, upon leaving his childhood sweetheart (Glenn Close) becomes distracted by a mystery woman (Barbara Hershey) and nearly pays with his life, losing ""The Way"" and floundering in obscurity for the better part of the next two decades.

In America, we not only love our heroes, we love tales of redemption.  And it is this aspect of ""The Natural"" that is typically overlooked.  We see our hero losing his focus not only on the way to realizing his dream as a young man, but also once he seemingly has his dreams realized as a supposedly more mature man (perhaps understandably under the influence of Kim Basinger).  And, in his reunion with Glenn Close in Chicago, we see him again find the path, ""The Way"" that restores his harmonious place within the game and the universe.

Look for particularly slimy and conniving performances as well from ""A Christmas Story's"" Darren McGavin (""Gus"") and all-career actor Robert Duvall (sports hack -uh, writer- ""Max Mercy""), generally cast against type in roles that really make you dislike them; this is further proof of their genius and it only serves to make the conclusion of the story that much more rewarding.

It doesn't hurt that, aside from the glaring casting faus pas of having Redford and Close play their characters as Midwestern teenagers as well as their mature ""present day"" selves, Barry Levinson just absolutely shot the daylights out of this movie.  Major League Baseball had a marketing campaign a few years back called ""Baseball Like It Oughtta Be"", but Levinson has trumped them at every turn with the cinematography that is itself every bit as much the star as the actors.  The scenes that take place off the field are beautiful enough, but the game sequences are just incredible.  And the score adds as much to it as the more memorable efforts of Ennio Morricone do to Sergio Leone's epic Westerns; is that REALLY Randy Newman's work?  Every time Hobbs connects with the ball, the grandiose theme and slow-motion photography (very reminiscent of NFL Films' best work for the game of pro football) give the viewer the unescapable impression that there is an element of the supernatural at work with ""The Natural"".  The cyclical rise, fall, birth, death, and rebirth (recovering from a recurrance of his earlier injury in a maternity ward?  Get serious!) of Hobbs is irresistible to the baseball fan and the period of the film and the ""Old Hollywood"" flavor of the storytelling and pacing should be attractive to the non-sports fan as well.  Entertainment at the movies just doesn't get any better than this.",1108166400,,4765,4.895652173913043

The movie avoids the usual Hollywood pitfalls of making a statement where no statement is needed (Holly Hunters library speech in Field of Dreams) and by avoiding meaningless cliques by the effective use of archetypes.  For instance, the mystery woman who abruptly ends Hobbs fledging career is dressed in black as contrasted to Iris, Hobbs lost love, who stands in the bleachers backlighted by a halo of light.  Also the  use of lightening at critical movements of Hobbs life and career are but two examples of powerful archetype.
Aside from a good story, this is movie making at its best.  The cinematography is beautiful.  Case in point: The contest between Roy Hobbs (the Robert Redford character) and the Whammer (played to the tee by Joe Don Baker).  Cool summer evening, setting sun, beautiful light, the cottonwood fluff floating gently in the air and steam periodically erupting from the locomotive- it is a visual masterpiece.  Add to the beautiful cinematography, the musical score from Randy Newman.  Nineteen years after the making of this movie when one hears Newman's score we think- Baseball!
The attention to detail and editing were also superb.  Who make those advertising signs in the outfield?  Bump Baileys meeting a premature end crashing into the outfield wall next to the crying baby sign?  That is what I call attention to detail.  How about this?  In the  train scenes the train actually rocks on its tracks as it speeds along its way- Roy has to steady himself as he talks to the woman in black.

Robert Redford is an extraordinary guy.  Never a word of scandal is written
about him.  He lives quietly with his family on a ranch in western United
States.  He runs the annual Sundance Film Festival and he is politically
active as a loyal democrat.  He has had his share of bad films as all
Hollywood stars have but he has evened it all out with a Best Actor Oscar
nomination for 1973's 'The Sting' and a win in the Best Director category
for 1980's 'Ordinary People'.  His other impressive list of credits include
such diverse films as 'Quiz Show' (1994) for which he received another Oscar
nomination as Best Director and 1988's gem and little seen 'The Milagro
Beanfield War' which squeezed its way in to win an Oscar for Dave Grusin's
music score.  Redford's 1998 film 'The Horse Whisperer' should have had more
success but this film will become a buried treasure of the future and will
take its time to truly get noticed.

Redford's 1984 film 'The Natural' is a film that greatly divided the
critics.  Some accused it of being an obvious soap opera while others
praised it as being an old fashioned story which brought back memories of
Hollywood's golden era.  The plain truth is that 'The Natural' is a story of
lost youth with one man wondering how things would have turned out if his
life had gone in a different direction.  What makes it extremely worthwhile
and fascinating to watch is the fact that the circumstances in this man's life
that hand him a sour lemon are determined by fate and not by choice.

Set primarily from the early to mid 1920's to about 1940, Redford plays Roy
Hobbs, a man who can do anything that the game of baseball requires.....and
he excels at it.  As a friend of his says to a sports writer: ""I thought you
might have heard of his 8 no-hitters.""  The story of 'The Natural' is truly
filled with fairy tale like qualities and sentimental charm.  As a boy,
Roy's father helps him develop a talent for baseball and after his dad dies,
Roy makes a bat from a tree that was struck by lightning and appropriately
names the bat ""Wonderboy"" as he brands the name on his bat along with the
image of a lightning bolt.  Roy also has a special lady in his life named
Iris Gaines (Glenn Close).  Roy leaves her behind and intends to send for
her when he makes it in the big leagues.

At a carnival one fine day, after being provoked and taking on a bet, he
strikes out a heavy hitter in the major leagues whose nick name is ""The
Whammer"" (Joe Don Baker in a take on Babe Ruth).  Traveling with ""The
Whammer"" is sports writer Max Mercy (Robert Duvall).  The amazing feat
accomplished by Hobbs stuns everyone including the mysterious Harriet Bird
(Barbara Hershey) who is instrumental in Hobbs' future.  The rest of the
story can be explored from here at your own convenience for fear of
spoilers.

Other notable members of the cast are Kim Basinger as a floozy who tries to
seduce Roy in a set up by gamblers and swindlers.  Robert Prosky is the
film's villain as a judge determined to take over the team from Pop Fisher
(Wilford Brimley).  A sly performance which goes uncredited in the film is
by Darren McGavin as an unscrupulous bookie who makes 10 million dollars a
year (about 100 million by today's standards).

Directed by Barry Levinson with a screenplay by Roger Towne and Phil
Dusenberry based on Bernard Malamud's novel, 'The Natural' is a fulfilling
drama of hope and inspiration that captured four Oscar nominations for Caleb
Deschanel's sunlight enriched photography and scenes of silhouettes and many
dark passages which make the film stand out in a truly visual fashion.
Glenn Close was the only member of the cast to receive a nomination, this
time in the Best Supporting Actress category and the art direction/set
decoration made the era look totally authentic as it and the triumphantly
rousing music score by Randy Newman were also nominated.

For those who have flocked away from the game of baseball in recent years
since the devastating loss of the World Series in 1994 due to labor and
management difficulties, 'The Natural' and 1989's 'Field of Dreams' are two
great films that renew your faith in the game and may draw you to it even if
you were never a baseball fan to begin with.

As a kid, the first time I watched The Natural I dreamed to be the hero like Robert Redford, helping the losing team become a respectable and a winning team.  I didn't understand the flashbacks but I believed in the magic.
 The story begins with a young Roy Hobbs practicing baseball. One summer night a huge lightening bolt strikes an oak tree outside of his bedroom window.  Hobbs makes a bat from the fallen oak tree.  He carves a lightening bolt onto the bat and carriers the bat throughout his baseball career. This event is where Hobbs is transformed; he can play infield, the outfield and has unnatural power when at bat.  Robert Redford plays the part  of Roy Hobbs perfectly.  He is quiet, determined and focused, he appears to be a  natural athlete.  The story takes a  turn due to bad luck; all baseball players are superstitious as the movie gives a lot reference to that.
Women are Hobs' weakness and cause him to have bad luck in his life.  This is a problem for athletes because they get distracted.  Kim Bassinger plays her role well as a beautiful seductress.  And  the reason this story is great is that Hobbs' love for the game gives him the power to give every once of his strength to the game he loves.  This story gets better each time you see it and it never goes flat.  It is a classic.",1068595200,,1409,4.395348837209302
497822,4,6302662591,"I'm really torn with the Director's Cut. On one hand, I was glad to get the never-before-seen scenes. On the other, I thought this film was fine the way it was. The Director's Cut came off as being much ""darker"" than the original.

I guess my one big complaint about the Director's Cut is that even though they added a lot more scenes, they also took a few away. I didn't mind the flashbacks, but they took away some of the dialogue between the Whammer and Hobbs on the train. There were a couple other fairly inconsequential scenes that are no longer in the film.

The original was easier to follow, and I wonder how easy it would be to follow the Director's Cut without having seen the original. Since Robert Redford played Hobbs when he first set out to start his career, it might be a little confusing for those who see those early scenes, while at the same time seeing a ""grown up"" Hobbs as he reflects on his life. The only thing that might help clear it up is when Hobbs mentions that he was out of the game for 16 years.

Also, I gave the original film the benefit of the doubt with regards to the games that were played at Wrigley Field. When Hobbs hits the home run that breaks the clock, it appears as though it was a game ending home run, due to the editing, but if you look closely, none of the players walk off the field as though the game is over (the Cubs would have last at bats.) However, when he hits four home runs the next day, you can clearly hear the announcer's voiceovers describe the home runs as being hit in the bottom of each inning. Oops.

I don't want to spoil anything, but there was one interesting new scene between Bump and Roy. Given that Bump was just told that he has one more chance to shape up, his actions towards Roy aren't surprising at all.

Despite his MAJOR flaws with regards to the shady women in his life, Roy Hobbs is still a hero. I would still highly recommend either one of these films, but would probably favor the original. I could have enjoyed a Director's Cut even if they just put the new scenes into their special features disc instead of ingrained into the actual movie.

497824,3,6302662591,"THE NATURAL has some truly great elements, especially the much copied score, good cinematography, and some moments that almost capture the mythical quality of baseball.  Unfortunately, it falls short of the greatness it should have achieved.  Nevertheless, THE NATURAL is arguably one of the better films about baseball (along with ""Pride of the Yankees""), and it's worth a look.
Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, a man who truly loves baseball.  All his life, he's been poised for greatness, but life has thrown him for some loops.  He returns to the game in his late 30s and gets a final shot.  Redford is pretty good in the role, although he's really too old for the part.  Barry Levinson directs, and his direction is unusally ham-fisted...he and the actors telegraph every plot twist.  Glenn Close was nominated for an Oscar, but she really isn't that good as Hobb's long-time love interest.  Ultimately, the movie is too melodramatic and unfocused with cardboard characters, especially the villianous judge.

497825,5,6302662591,"This movie is often considered to be the greatest film ever made about baseball, but it's much more than that. To restrict ""The Natural"" to the genre of a sports movie is to miss its essential point and its goodness. No doubt that many will never gravitate towards this film, which is much more intellectual and adroit than other sports movies. Here the characters are muted, ethereal and other-worldly, but you understand them and their motivations.
Robert Redford is perfectly cast as the aging hero, Roy Hobbs. Never a favorite of mine, Redford delivers a stellar rendering; it's hard to imagine any other actor pulling off this role. Redford was 47 years old at the time of filming, but he's still trim, beautiful and wistful, like an aging oak tree. He underplays the role and is never likeable or knowable, but that is part of the charm. Unlike movies such as ""The Pride of the Yankees,"" the baseball scenes here are believable and Redford looks like an athlete. The only small criticism is that they film all the pitches in slow-motion to heighten the dramatic effects.
Glenn Close and Kim Basinger are adequate, nothing more, in their roles. Robert Duvall, as the inquisitive sports writer, is excellent, which is hardly surprising since Duvall is always exceptional in any role. The cinematography is awe inspiring. Watch when Roy hits homeruns which cascade into the lights and the resulting explosions and fireworks. It's poetry and beauty all at once. Watch the shadows fall as the ""Wonder Boy"" bat is broken and the tubby bat boy hands Roy another stick.
The subplot of murder, avarice and revenge are omnipresent and not the outstanding portions of the movie. The greatness lies in the scenes on the diamond itself, as well as the poignant interplay between Close and Redford off the field. I've seen this film a dozen times and never fail to tear up when Glenn Close stands next to her son in the waning moments of the film and Hobbs blasts another home run. A mesmerizing movie, a true keeper.",1057968000,,2009,4.792507204610951
497826,5,6302662591,"This is an extrordinary depiction of Roy Hobbs' dream to be the ""best there ever was"" in baseball. Certainly the whole ""good vs evil"" concept has been done time and time again in movies, but the way this film constructs the fall of Hobbs, and tranforms him into the living legend of the New York Knights, is wonderful.
One of the paramount messages of the film is not just the story of Roy Hobbs. It is about belief in an idea and making it happen. Hobbs' quest takes him from small town guy who dreams of making it big to having to come back later to baseball because of an injury suffered. When he gets to the ""show"" later in life, he must restore faith in a ""washed up"" manager who does not think he has what it takes. To attain his dream, he also must sidestep the corruption of powerful owners and media personalities.
Critics of the film may say that some of the parts are unreal. I don't think the story was meant to be an accurate illustration of a typical baseball player's life; it is a mythological journey for Roy Hobbs to come from the depths of failure to the joy of achievement.
I think this is a great movie for anyone, especially a baseball fan, because it is inspirational and sends a positive message about achievement of one's dreams.",1056326400,,1254,4.386266094420601
497827,4,6302662591,"I approach reviewing the movie 'The Natural' with some fear and trembling -- not being someone raised on American sports, baseball has often held the image in my mind as being a sort of circular cricket game. However, beyond the basic mechanics of the game is the psychology, and, by and large, there is a very different mindset to athletics in America than there is outside of America (though this is changing over time); certainly as I was growing up, I had no sports-figure heroes, nor did I ever consider professional sports as a potential career even in a fantasy.
Beyond the general psychology of sports in America, baseball has a ranking with pride of place, being a national pasttime. To this end, to further my research for this review, I treated myself to that most American of activities, a baseball game, on that most American of holidays, the fourth of July. Being nearest to Indianapolis, there are no major leagues in town, so I went to the minor league game (Indianapolis Indians against the Louisville Riverbats -- the Indians won handily 7-2). I finally began to have some insights into what could be interesting and exciting and fun about baseball. I am certain that my reflections on 'The Natural' would be very different without that experience.
Perhaps it is a fantasy of many Americans to be a natural at sports in general, and some sport in particular. Baseball, having been woven into the history of the country, gives a particular insight into what can be best and worst in life through the game -- honour, glory, happiness; greed, betrayal, vice.
Barry Levinson's 1984 film, 'The Natural', shows the love of the game in full force. Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, an almost mythically inspired character, complete with mythic instruments (a bat that is made from a lightning charged tree, perhaps a bat 'anointed by the gods', as it were). Having been a natural from childhood days, he suffers an injury by a mysterious woman in his young manhood that (so far as we know in the film) cuts short a promising career. Is she the Delilah that cuts down a Sampson? If so, why (other than to set up the rest of the film).
Many years later, a much more mature Hobbs returns from out of nowhere to lead a desperate team to victory, overcoming the greed and corruption that big-time money injects into the game for a riveting, round-the-bases having hit out the lights home run that brings the fans to their feet and the puts the bad guys to shame.
What could be more natural than that?
While this is a good story and ends with a happy, yet somewhat incomplete scene of Hobbs playing ball with with a boy (will he be a natural, too?) while a rescued woman (oh yes, did I forget the love story? -- my mistake -- Glenn Close turns in a reasonable but far from her best performance as the love interest on the sidelines while Kim Basinger plays the sultry temptress intertwined in the murky dealing with the power brokers) watches, there are too many unexplained events and tenuous connexions for me to think of this as a great film. Unanswered questions abound.
However, the movie is good entertainment, even for someone who hasn't been to a baseball game. The pace is leisurely (like a baseball game), and the action goes from slow to riveting to gentle to exciting and back again. The dialogue is not inspired, but adequate for the plot. Some judicious editing might have made the movie hold together a bit better.
I can see the love of the game over all other considerations, and I can sense that in Hobbs character. And I can see the reality in many of the other characters. However, this is not executed well enough in philosophic terms to be a morality tale, and underdeveloped in human terms.
In the end, like the baseball game I attended on the fourth of July, I'm glad I saw it, but alas, I didn't fall in love with it. Perhaps I'm just a cricket man at heart.",1054252800,,3885,4.607503607503608
497828,4,6302662591,"I liked this show although I admit I don't like some of the directions it takes.  It starts out with Roy (Robert Redford) and his Dad throwing the ball around on the farm.  His Dad realizes that Roy will become a great pitcher if he keeps working at it.  In a ""shades of Superman"" scene, Roy's Dad dies of a heart attack on the farm. Years later, Roy is called up by the Cubs for a tryout.  Glenn Close is his girl, he tells her the good news and she's sure he will make it big.  He leaves on the train and life starts getting complicated.  A veteran ballplayer called ""The Whammer"" (Joe Don Baker) is also on the train.  He has a ""Babe Ruth"" sort of aura about him (except he's not a lefty).  The train makes a stop in a small town, Roy's agent challenges the Whammer, claiming Roy can strike him out in three pitches.  They take the contest to a nearby field and Roy strikes him out.  But Roy's life takes a huge turn for the worst when he visits a woman who has it in for great athletes.  His life gets sidetracked for something like 16 years.  But he makes a comeback, this time as a rightfielder and comes up from the minors to the New York Knights, a pro team.  Wilford Brimley is the Knight's manager.  Brimley won't let Roy even participate in practice because of his age, thinks he's some kind of joke and decides to send him back to the minors.  But he changes his mind and tells Roy to show up for batting practice the next day.  Roy brings his own bat, a bat he made long ago from a tree on his farm that lightning struck.  He starts slugging every pitch into the seats.  When he finally gets to play in a real game his hitting becomes legendary.  He practically becomes a cult figure with the kids.  The ballpark scenes in this show are the best in the movie.  It gives you a feel of what pro ball was like in 1939.  It isn't all smooth sailing from there on though.  Forces are at work to see that the Knights fail.  Roy seems destined to thwart their plans and must be thrown off course someway.  Despite an injury, he comes back to play his last game, with the pennant at stake.  He's the last batter up with two outs in the 9th and two on.",1053129600,,2156,4.134939759036144
497829,5,6302662591,"Critics of this movie have suggested that it is saccharin in its sentiment, unrealistic, and not faithful to the Bernard Malamud novel of the same name. In a sense, all of this is true.
The charge of not being faithful to the Malamud novel is certainly true. It is, in fact, sort of the polar opposite of Malamud's cynical, bitter novel, for which I for one am grateful. Malamud's novel come from a time when writers were so shocked by the essentially carnivorous business of the world that they tended to shriek in a childish wail about their own lost innocence.
Be assured, this is not a ""realistic"" expos&eacute; on the business of baseball in America. This film is an exercise in myth making, which is always a fairly dramatic, sentimental undertaking. Folks that carp about the ""hokey"" quality of this film have missed the point completely and also missed a great movie.
I loved this movie. Here's why:
First, Robert Redford is magnificent as Roy Hobbs, the golden natural from the heartland whose baseball career is sidetracked by a demented fan. He vanishes for a long time, and then reappears as a middle-aged rookie, much older and wiser. This is one of my favorite Redford roles ever because the actor fits the role so perfectly. When Redford comes back to baseball as a damaged, mature man, he really shines. He has always had a talent for saying a few words that reveal whole histories, and that quality is put to great use here.
Secondly, the supporting cast for this movie has many great performances: Glen Close plays Iris Gaines, Roy's true love and guardian angel, and this, along with Dangerous Liaisons, is one of her very good outings. Kim Basinger turns in a complex performance as Memo Paris, the fatal female that is both sympathetic and poison at the same time. But my favorite performance is Darren McGavin as huckster and company man, Gus Sands. McGavin is simply great. His character will smile and tell you a dirty joke while he eases a knife into your back, and McGavin seems to have a great time throughout.
Lastly, the film is told in dramatic, heroic terms. The scenes are set up, as is the cinematography, to capture the most dramatic expects of a situation. This film really goes for the heart and makes no apologies. Roy Hobbs is a baseball myth, pure and simple. The sound track, by Randy Newman, surges and swells in epic strokes. Newman himself has said it was his first opportunity to compose a piece of music that was ""heroic.""

497888,4,6302662591,"This is another one that I recently re-watched on cable. I must upgrade my film collection to include the DVD version now. So many reviews here seem to be attacking its sentimentality; get over it!! It amazes me that so many filmgoers can't view a movie with a positive and sophisticated charm without rolling their eyes or sticking their finger down their throat. (As if we don't have enough coarse, angry, 'edgy' films in release already.) I don't mind Redford's Joe Hardy-like ability one bit, because success- for all of his skill and talent- still dosen't come to him easily. He must suffer a physical tragedy, be elusive with his greedy contemporaries, and finally deal with the past- which he spends the entire movie trying to hide- catch up to him at the end. The one nitpick I have with the whole film was the painfully obvious soft-focus photography used to disguise Redford's age throughout the film. It isn't so bad in the first reel when he's supposed to be a teenager (and the camera shoots him at length), but later, when he's supposed to be 36, he just *isn't*. Glenn Close is radiant as his love from childhood, and shines in a memorable scene when they are first reunited at one of his games. After he goes into a foreshadowed slump, it is the arrival of Close (angelically backlit, and whose presence he senses even before seeing her) that brings him back to winning.

How many times have all of us seen plots like this?  Yet THE NATURAL takes this story, wraps it mythically and magically around the great game of baseball, and provides an entertaining, enjoyable film.
Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a 36-year-old athlete who has waited 16 painful years for his chance to play major league baseball.  His past is dubious, ambiguous.  But he posesses a ""natural"" talent to dominate the game--even at the age of 36.  And he does.  Yet his meteoric success and instant acclaim pit Roy against two adversaries:  newspaper reporter Max Mercy (Robert Duvall), who is obsessed with uncovering the secrets of Roy's past; and The Judge (Robert Prosky), the corrupt owner of Roy's team.  The stage is set--good vs. evil--and the battle ensues, to a mesmerizing ending.
Glenn Close as Iris Gaines, the true love of Roy's life, is terrific in this film, but by far my two favorite characters were manager Pop Fisher (Wilford Brimley) and his assistant, Red Blow (Richard Farnsworth), who virtually bring alive the game of Depression Era baseball.  I could have done without the discomfort of watching Redford and Close play 18-year-old lovers at the beginning of this film (talk about suspension of disbelief), but overall director Barry Levinson furnishes a rich, well-told story.

I can't resist these film tributes to America's Pastime, and I've watched ""The Natural"" a hundred times...wore out the VHS, bought the unbelievable soundtrack by Randy Newman, and rejoiced when it was released on DVD.
What makes this movie so special? Well, first of all, it reminds us of how Baseball ought to be...before the corruption of our modern era of strikes, multi-million dollar deals, steroids, corporate named stadiums & television & cable rights. The Natural, is all about loving the game. The love affair with baseball and its history oozes in every frame. It depicts the triumph of good over evil, and success rising out of tragedy.
The casting director deserves an oscar. He or she was dead on! Robert Redford is ideal as Roy Hobbs. Often backlit, he looks ethereal. Fans of Redford will witness his all time greatest on-screen smile when Wilford Brimley tells Hobbs to ""suit up"" towards the end of the film. Speaking of Wilford, he was born to play the role of the Knight's manager! Also perfectly cast are the roles of heroine, Glenn Close and femme fatale Kim Bassinger. Richard Farnsworth has a sweet role. I especially loved the genuine scene when he takes a grateful Roy Hobbs out to an Italian restaurant for his first major league dinner. ""I can't spell it, but it sure does eat good""! I could go on and on ...Duvall, Prosky...every role superbly cast!
The greatest visual snipets are the reaction shots from the audience and fellow ball players when Roy Hobbs displays his NATURAL abilities. The film is full of ""little things"" that puts it over the top.
The film score must be mentioned! I know that Randy Newman FINALLY won an oscar for some Disney movie...but I think it was payback for his being ROBBED in 1985 for Best Score. His score is magnificent, and is a key reason this movie viewers respond so emotionally to this film. My teenage daughter often requests I put this CD on in the car...that is how good it is!
Based on Benard Malamuds novel by the same name, (it does have a different ending), The Natural is about choices made, the things done for love. Its about purity, devotion, good over evil.

497937,1,6302662591,"Robert Reford's dream of a baseball natural is absurd on many levels. I don't mind fantasy type films at all..HOWEVER, they have to have some characters that an audience can have some connection with.
Roy can hit the cover off a baseball..and Mr. Brimley and co...drop their jaws in amazement. Roy can pitch better that Cy Young...and Mr. Brimley's jaw also and again drops in amazement.
( hackneyed dialogue) How many ways can one say WOW!
Many of the fine suppporting actors deliver their lines in amazement..( Robert Duvall etc). Using the game of baseball as a base for all the other insufferable nuances attempted by this film is truly sad indeed.
Jimmy Piersall had nothing on Mr. Roy here! Mr. Reford has been out in the sun a bit too long..perhaps he should learn how to hit a cut off man from the outfield. Maybe he has kryptonite in his bat...you know the one he made as a kid...and still uses now to Nuke any baseball..thrown at him. Gosh...There are zero authentic... in tone baseball scenes..who cares...this film hits the triple crown for infantile dialogue, absurd staging and general hokum.
There are many great fantasy films out there..this is not one of them.,...perhaps Mr. Reford,'next film will have Charles Van Doren pitching!!

497938,3,6302662591,"As a baseball fan and film buff, I always loved this film: a wonderful cast, brilliant photography, inspiring musical score, and deeply cool NY Knights baseball uniforms. Then I read Bernard Malamud's novel and discovered something rather disturbing: the film is not only unfaithful to its source, but in a way completely reverses the author's thematic intentions, so much so that I'm surprised Malamud allowed his name to be attached to it.
Malamud based the novel on the tale of Sir Percival, the Grail-Knight, who made his own sword and was ultimately defeated for his arrogance and vanity. Malamud's Roy Hobbs is shallow, vain, materialistic, hungry for the glory and admiration that come with stardom but unmindful of the responsibility, constantly making wrong decisions (especially with regard to women) and never acknowledging his own failures and limitations. In the end, he strikes out, the Knights lose, the scandal hits the papers, and Roy, crushed and broken, realizes that he never learned from his mistakes and weeps ""many bitter tears."" In a way, Roy was like the Mighty Casey, a hero who proved to be fallible even as the hordes cheered him on.
Barry Levinson's film offers a completely different take on the myth of the American sports hero, turning him into more of a Sir Gallahad, noble and pure, golden-haired and chiseled, who rescues the sad-sack Knights from oblivion and leads them all the way to the promised land, in the process rediscovering his long-lost love and thwarting the evil plans of some shady characters. The light-shattering home run that ends the film, and the pastoral wheat-field scene in the coda, punctuate the feel-good, all's-well-that-ends-well Hollywood fantasy.
Malamud's theme was that heroes are not all they're cracked up to be; flawed, selfish, ordinary human beings whom we probably ought not to hold in such high regard. Levinson's film eviscerates that theme and replaces it with something decidedly less literary and more ""entertaining.""
That said, it is a fine film in its own right, and some of the novel's characters (especially Wilford Brimley's Pop Fisher, Robert Duvall's Max Mercy and Joe Don Baker's Ruth-like ""Whammer"") and moments (Roy knocking the cover off the ball) come through brilliantly. It's just disappointing that it's ultimately so different from the novel; perhaps it should have been re-titled.

497939,5,6302662591,"""The Natural"" - a story about an aging man's fight to hold on to the game he loves so much. Robert Redford, playing Roy Hobbs, a man in his mid thirties tries to break back into major league baseball after a sixteen year absence. Fans of the novel, by Bernard Malamud, have righty critisized the ending of this movie, which is nothing like the ending in the book. Still, it is powerful, over-all, with great performances from Glenn Close, Robert Duvall, Kim Basinger, and Wilford Brimley.
The movie begins with a young Roy Hobbs, playing ball with his father on the family farm. We can see how well a pitcher young Hobbs it, and it is his father's dream he become a baseball player. The man never lives long enough to see the dream realized, however. Still grieving his father's loss when lightening strikes a tree on the farm, Hobbs is drawn to make a bat out of one of its branches. ""Wonderboy"" he calls it. Success follows, as Hobbs is offered a contract to play ball. The night before he leaves is spent with his sweetheart, Iris, played by Glenn Close. He never makes it to his destination.
Along the way, Hobbs meets up with a mysterious woman who sees in Hobbs a greatness, and she asks him if he will be the greatest ball player ever. When he responses yes - out of some twisted feelings she shoots him, thinking she will gain some kind of fame herself. Her plot backfires, but so to does Hobbs dream of playing ball; at least, for sixteen years.
The screen fades to black, and the words ""sixteen years later"" appear. Hobbs is older, and has been assigned to play with the New York Knights, a lackluster ball club in last place that can't seem to do anything right.
The Knights manager, Pops, played by Wilford Brimely, quickly develops a dislike for Hobbs, and refuses to let him play. He has made a bargain with the team's owner, the Judge, that if they win the penant, Pops will control the ballteam. But if they lose, he is out, and the Judge Takes full control of the team.
When the leading star for the Knights, Bump Bailey, and Pops argue over a call, Hobbs is called in to replace Bump. Lightning strikes, and Hobbs hits a home run, literaly knocking the cover off the ball. After Bump suffers a fatal crash through the ballpark fence, Hobbs takes over his position, and the homeruns start stacking up, all with wins. Suddenly the New York Knights are contenders for the penant, thanks to Hobbs and his miraculous bat.
Memo, played by Kim Basinger is called in to use Hobbs, to distract him from the game so the Knights will start losing again. Her ""special"" techniques work, and soon he is striking out at every at bat; but only until Hobbs meets up with his old sweetheart, Iris, again. Their romance is rekindled, and Hobbs begins to play better ball.
When his sixteen year old wound begins to bother him again, he is sent to the hospital.  Without him in the line up, the Knightss begin loosing.  The penant is almost out of reach for Pops.  Hobbs makes a decision to return to the game, sore as he is, knowing how much the team, and Pops, need him.  Everything is relying on this one game ...
If you look beyond the ""hokum"" as some people call it, ""The Natural"" can be a very enjoyable baseball movie. The happy ending is certainly typical of Hollywood, but at least it is better contrived than other of Hollywoods happy endings.",1005782400,,3350,4.4779050736497545
497940,5,6302662591,"I've heard many critics deride The Natural as hokum. They dismiss the film as well crafted, but criticize it as too long and too overblown. To be sure, The Natural doesn't bear much resemblance to the novel by Bernard Malamud in which Roy Hobbs takes money, strikes out to lose the pennant and is forced from baseball in disgrace. However, the film, as presented, is a wonderful realization of every baseball fan's dream. What baseball fan ever dreamed of winning the World Series with a sacrifice fly? When children dream of baseball, they dream of hitting a massive grand slam in the seventh game of the World Series with two outs in the bottom of the ninth and the home team trailing by three runs. The Natural is the visual realization of every baseball fan's dream. Roy Hobbs hits the monumental home runs that every fan dreams about -- shots that destroy clocks, literally knock the covers off balls and annihilate light towers. Just as with all our goals in life, we, as baseball fans, don't fantasize about just barely clearing the outfield wall, we want to blast each pitch into outer space, ensuring that everyone will remember our moment of glory. So few of us ever come close to realizing even a fraction of our dreams. Unless they are a New York Yankees fan, every baseball fan has many more moments of heartbreak than exhiliration. The Natural allows all baseball fans to realize, however fleetingly, the sheer joy of seeing their dreams realized.",1005091200,,1461,4.755905511811024
497941,5,6302662591,"I must say, when I first saw this movie, I thought it all fantasy. A brilliant movie, yes, but the final scene was pure cotton candy, the suffering ball player moved to perform extraodinarily. The feeling I have, however, is that this movie is not anymore one based in fiction.
There's a feeling that baseball, long in the dugout for the past decade, has left the on-deck circle, strolled to the plate, wiped clean the batter's box chalk , tapped it's cleats, surveyed the field and coiled to swing at the first pitch, ready to take flight. The heroics of games 4, 5 and 7 of the World Series seemed to tip their cap to the heroics of this movie, and to times gone by.
After all, the last time I can remember enjoying this much the events of the Series was the parallel non-fiction event to ""The Natural"": Kirk Gibson's dramatic, limping gimpy all-arm 3-2 walk-off home run of Game 1 of the '88 series vs. the dreaded bash brothers and Dennis Eckersley.

Roy plays for the fun of the game, not for the money or anything else. I didn't understand the woman shooting him in the beginning until I read the book, that is the only flaw in this movie. That whole part of movie kind of leaves you wondering, ""What was all that about?"" Anyhow the movie really makes up for it, with Roy coming back to baseball sixteen years after the incident.

498009,5,6302662591,"I don't care for baseball.  Never have.  Truth be told, I would rather watch a meaningless pre-season football game than game 7 of the World Series.  I've even tried watching it in person, but the game still seems about as dull as watching the grass grow.
That said, it is ironic that this is my all time favorite sports movie.  The cast is top notch;  Robert Redford, Glenn Close and Robert Duvall are all cream of the crop actors.  As the best sports movies do, the story transcends the game itself & uses it as a metaphor for life.  Unexpectedly, the film also includes unmistakable mythology imagery regarding a hero's quest.  Some of the symbolism is obvious, some of it is not.  The majority of it, however, does not take a Jungian analysis to understand.  Barbara Hershey and Kim Basinger play their parts well as two sultry sirens who attempt to lure unsuspecting men to crash into the rocks.
The story takes place in the late 1920s;  a simpler time, when some professional athletes had the audacity to play for the love of the game rather than the intention of getting a signing bonus with their next team (gasp!!!  what a concept!!).  Robert Redford plays an incredibly gifted baseball player whose life goes awry due to the adversity posed by an unexpected incident.  He finds that he must struggle to keep playing the game he loves. I don't cry at movies very much, but I will admit I did cry the first time I saw ""The Natural.""  OK, I also cried the 2nd time I saw it, too.

498010,5,6302662591,"This is one great baseball movie.  It has all the right ingredients to join a childhood dream, baseball ""The National Past Time"" (circa 1940's post World War II), an array of interesting characters and you the audience on a journey of emotion enlightment & family fullfillment in the circle of life.
This widescreen (16:9) is the perfect format to watch this movie.  The cinematography is amazing and adds the necessary tempo for the equally sensational musical score by Randy Neuman.
Robert Redford does a credible and believable job protraying this exceptional fictional baseball player, Roy Hobbs.
In summary;  The movie opens with the classic father & son playing catch, bonding and the fathers encouragement to his sons exceptional ""Natural"" ability in the game of baseball.  The ""gift"" he called it.  Events occur where the father dies of a stroke under a tree which is shortly after struck by lightning.  The son Roy Hobbs, Makes a bat from the fallen tree in rememberence of his father.  He burns the name, ""WonderBoy"" & a bolt of lightning into the bat. Years later Roy leaves his family, girlfriend (he receives a very passionate sendoff) & home to seek his dream of being the greatest baseball player of ""All Time"". Roy's dream begins with nothing to stop him but quickly turns into a nightmare when a brief encounter with a 'La Femme Fatale' short circuits his dreams.  The rest is ""The Natural's"" ability to come back.
The movie is one you'll enjoy over & over again.  The extra ""The Heart of the Natural"" with Cal Ripkin Jr. is the perfect frosting on the cake featurette.
So, ""Take me out to the ball game. Take me out to the crowd. Buy me some peanuts & cracker jacks. I don't know if I'll ever get back!!!!""

I bet that almost every kid who played baseball at any level, had many day dreams of being ""The Natural"", playing at a level above all others, and getting the ""big hit"" or making the ""big play"".  The Natural isn't reality, and it shouldn't be. It's about the ""what if"" of baseball that reaches into the soul of the former sandlot player, adds some adult twists, and connects the childhood dreams to the adult cinema.  I enjoy this film, not because it's about the way it is, but because it's the way I dreamed it could be.  Roy Hobbs (the main character played by Redford) appears to have it all.  Looks, incredible talent, big league prospects, when his life takes a sudden unfortunate turn.  He returns to baseball and against the odds, lives a baseball dream.  Dramatic?  Yes.  Realistic?  Not really.  But I'd rather be entertained by this baseball fantasy, than watch the biography of today's typical player.  It's more pleasurable to watch Roy Hobbs overcome his baseball challenges, than to watch a player go though drug rehab and salary arbitration while batting .260.
On the cast, Redford is perfectly cast, and Wilford Brimley as Pops the Team Manager is right on the nose.  This is a very good baseball film that deserved better treatment by the critics.

498056,5,6302662591,"For its rather blatant and somewhat hokey liberties with the actual ending of the Malamud novel (if you haven't seen or read either, I'll not spoil it, but put it this way - in the novel, the title character doesn't exactly come out as a saviour in the end), it is tempting to dock a star and a half. But why quibble? You will see few films that take hokum from melded reality (Roy Hobbs, after all, is a hybrid of Shoeless Joe Jackson and Eddie Waitkus, the postwar infielder stalked and then shot by a disturbed female fan) and make it work as embraceably as this film does. Nor will you see very many baseball films which actually do cut to the indescribable (though God knows many have tried) grip which the game has kept upon a nation for almost a century and a half and expose it with such sinuous aplomb.
For that matter, Robert Redford fans will never see his wry understatement put to better use than as the star-crossed Roy Hobbs, or Glenn Close fans her almost ethereal passion better than as Iris. I'm not entirely sure why Darrin McGavin elected to go uncredited, though, since he damn near steals the show as the cagey bookmaker we presume is a stand-in for Arnold Rothstein, the early mob boss who likely bankrolled the 1919 World Series fix. Kim Basinger is better than she gets credit for being as the narcissistic Memo Paris, while Robert Duvall isn't as out of sync as you might otherwise expect as the amoral, self-congratulatory Max Mercy.

498057,5,6302662591,"This is one of those films where you heart loves it despite what your head might be telling you.  Barry Levinson's 1984 film abandon's the Shoeless Joe Jackson ending of Bernard Malamud's novel, choosing to go in a totally different direction, and I have to tell you I have no complaints (I even have a Roy Hobbs baseball card!).  ""The Natural,"" more than any other baseball film, attempts to deal with the game on a mythic level that can really exist only in the poetic world of fantasy.
Robert Redford plays Roy Hobbs, who is given a second chance to be the best baseball player who ever lived.  The early part of the film where you have to believe Redford is a teenage phenom is a bit of a reach, but the film seduces you into a willing suspension of disbelief with its glowing images and sentimentality.  As the older Hobbs, Redford's quiet desperation plays nicely.  The supporting cast of Glenn Close as Iris, the girl Roy left behind, Robert Duvall as the cynical sports reporter, Wilford Brimley as the crusty manager, Robert Farnsworth as the affable coach, and Robert Proskey as the malignancy who owns the team are all treats.  Barbara Hershey is memorably remote as the dangerous Harriet Bird but Jon Don Baker plays the mythical Whammer as if Babe Ruth was channeling Ty Cobb.  Only Kim Basinger seems out of place, and this is more because her character is so clearly bad news for Roy that you can never understand what he sees in her given what happened in his past.  Redford is the calm at the center of the storm, dignified in his efforts but boyish in his love for the game.
The film is essentially a collection of carefully crafted scenes: The opening vignette of Roy playing catch with his father, his first at bat in the majors, Iris refusing to see Roy fail in Chicago, his last at bat of the season and the dissolve to the final images as the circle is completed.  The cinematography by Caleb Deschanel needs to be enjoyed widescreen (I have my laser disc), while Randy Newman's score, easily one of the most memorable in movie history, adds something to virtually ever scene (I have the CD).

498061,5,6302662591,"yes, redford is too old here, yes the plot strains all credibility, and yes there is some ""corn"" mixed in... but if you put all cynicism aside, this film will transport you... its lyrical, moving and powerful, full of strong visuals and heartfelt emotions... it is a fable, and as such it merits suspension of disbelief...allow yourself to follow it and you will be rewarded...",969494400,,377,4.815384615384615
498062,5,6302662591,"This mythic take on Malamud's novel is spectacular.  Though the movie uses the game of baseball as its heartbeat, it is much more than a sports movie.  Robert Redford, in probably his last perfect role to date, is dashing and  winning in the lead role; Kim Basinger, as the ""bad girl"", and  Glenn Close, as the ""good girl"", are both wonderful and evoke  much emotion. The music, by Randy Newman, which you have heard a thousand  times without knowing it, is stunning, beautiful, moving -- and those  moments on the field, where extraordinary things happen, make your heart  leap.",962928000,,579,4.777777777777778
498063,5,6302662591,"By far the best baseball movie and sports movie of all time, IMO anyway.  In fact, I'd rank it in my top five movies of all time.  To each their own, of course.  So, it may not be for everyone.  But for those that preach  about it's unrealistic story, I say:  DUH.  It's pure fantasy, pure  romance.  It's written, directed, and filmed with superb adult wit and  creativity, but almost as if seen through a ten-year-old little leaguer's  eyes.  It's spectacular pop fiction from the first half of the 20th  century.  Enjoy it for the fantasy that is.  And don't judge it against any  other movie.  Apples and oranges. What a cast!  If you don't trust me, rent  it first.  If you're a die-hard, true-blue, baseball purist (and a lover of  fine films), you'll buy it afterwards.  Oh, and the soundtrack is  excellent, too.",960422400,,820,4.541666666666667
498064,2,6302662591,"I love baseball. To my mind, there's never been a more perfect sport. So when I see a 'baseball movie', the first thing I ask is 'was this movie REALISTIC about the game?' It's important to me that the film-makers  respect the game as much as I do. ""The Natural"" is perhaps the  most UNREALISTIC baseball movie ever (rivaling ""Major League"",  but at least they didn't take it so darn serious). And allegory shmallegory  -- if the only way to pick up on all the references is to read the book  first, then why make the movie at all?
This kid starts out as a better  pitcher than Cy Young, Christy Mathewson, Walter Johnson, and Lefty Grove  all rolled into one. He doesn't have the body of a home run hitter THEN,  much less decades later, when he suddenly becomes the equal of Babe  Ruth.
And the team! They play worse than your average semi-pro team until  he arrives, and then suddenly they have the grace and talent of the '27  Yankees. This technique has been used in all kinds of sports movies, but  none of them pretend to be realistic, as this one does.
I could go on and  on (the lightning strike, the blood through the uniform, the halo on Glenn  Close in the stands, yada yada yada), but I sum it up thusly:
""The  Natural"" LOOKS great -- it is a supremely beautiful film. But as Roger  Ebert said, ""Why didn't they make a movie about baseball?""",959644800,,1354,4.356
498105,5,6302662591,"This film is what made me remember what baseball is for, after losing all faith in the game after the strike.  It brought me back to the ballpark, for no other reason then a want to be closer to the past.  Robert Redford  is the quintisential Natural, which all adds up to a film that brought  tears to my eyes.  This film is neck and neck with Field of Dreams for best  baseball film of all time.",956448000,,397,4.090909090909091

498107,5,6302662591,Baseball is the Greatest Sport ever and this film works because it reflects that and so many other themes of Life together really well.in fact this film came to life for me when Kirk Gibson hit that Home run in the  1988 world Series with a two strike count when he was with the Dodgers  vs.the A's.the power to dream came with that Homerun.this is one of Roberet  Redoford's best.,952214400,,381,4.414285714285715
498108,5,6302662591,"Leonard Maltin is all wet.  He like other critics, at the time, missed the whole point of the film; which is to present an American-style mythological tale of heroism.  It is Beowulf and Camelot in a genre that out society can  understand, which is baseball.  It is a film that gets better as the years  go by, and one I never tire of viewing.",942883200,,343,4.296875
498109,5,6302662591,"What a film.  Stunning cinematography, excellent acting, and well-thought-out direction by the great Barry Levinson (of Rainman fame) add-up to create this film student's all-time favorite work.  You can smell  the infield dirt, and hear the sharp crack of horsehide on Ash while  watching this film.  To me, it's about as close to a ""full""  sensory experience as a film can come.  Lest we forget, Randy Newman's  soundtrack surely ranks as one of the top two or three of all time (With  deference to the great John Williams).  The music itself is what first  drove me to collect soundtracks, and indeed, provided me with much of my  love of film, and of the national pastime.",937440000,,676,4.782608695652174

498121,2,6302662591,"The Natural is one of the best examples of missed opportunities you are ever likely to see. It pits a baseball hero against all odds and nearly keeps you in suspense up until the ridiculous final third of the film. The  whole plot falls apart when Hobbs becomes Superman, and begins skinning  baseballs with his fantasyland bat. The climax, which involves a Grand Slam  into the floodlights, is really silly, and would be better served in a  Three Stooges comedy. A terrific buildup to a goofy climax. A real  disappointment.",924048000,,525,4.788888888888889
498122,5,6302662591,"Watch it and: count how many times Iris says, ""gotta go.""; This movie is like the Bible - lots of little stories and one big one.  Instead of spouting scripture like a couple of characters I know, I tend to preach  the significance of ""Pick me out a winner, Bobby."" -  ""Greenest stuff I ever saw."" - ""You know. We have met  before."" - ""I like the action."" - ""Think of all those  young boys out there."" - ""You've got a gift, Roy."" and the  key to life: Iris: ""You know, I think we have two lives."" Roy:  ""Huh?"" Iris: ""The one we learn with, and the one we live  with after that.""

All of the nuances and  intellectual  pontificating  aside, this movie embodies the childhood dream of every kid who ever  picked up a mitt or bat and  loved the game The thought of being the best there ever was lives in the souls of kids everywhere.  To me, Malmud got it wrong And Levinson got it right  a  Home Run is the only way the story can end,  regardless of how the book ends.
