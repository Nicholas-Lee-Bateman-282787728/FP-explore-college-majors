Some jump out of your seat moments too as the skinwalker closes in!
Would certainly recommend this film",1440979200,6,169,4.862068965517241
7306230,3,B0108N9AAY,"This is a Western and a creature feature mixed together, and the combination is pretty solid. The Wild West town and the costumes look great. The monster is a good, old-fashioned guy in a suit. It's mostly Western, and as such it's up to snuff. Really, the werewolf is incidental to the movie. The werewolf could have been any threat. But when the movie turns into cowboys fighting a werewolf, it's good stuff. (Joe Crowe, http://www.twitter.com/RevolutionSF)",1439769600,6,459,5.052631578947368
7306231,4,B0108N9AAY,"One of the better werewolf movies released in awhile, I was actually surprised that a western/werewolf movie would work, I know that sounds ridiculous but if your a fan of the werewolf genre then you should be satisfied with this as opposed to the other onslaught of wolf flicks and the acting was surprisingly better than Id have ever imagined.",1515974400,,345,4.766666666666667
7306232,5,B0108N9AAY,"Very enjoyable movie. It's a British take on a Western horror movie - in this case, the monster is not a werewolf but a Skinwalker. I love creature features and I honestly can't think of another Western horror movie that was any good at all, let alone very enjoyable. The dialog is witty, the characters are well developed - and well acted for the most part. There is also a good amount of humor and thankfully, not a lot of gore. I highly recommend this film. I enjoyed it so much that I went ahead and bought a digital copy.",1513382400,,526,4.27

7306235,2,B0108N9AAY,"I made it about 15 minutes before I turned this off. If this was meant to be bad intentionally, they went too far. Every time someone uses a gun they spin the damn thing, and every one talks like Yosimety Sam.",1507075200,,209,4.121951219512195

7306239,5,B0108N9AAY,"This is a great stagecoach werewolf movie.  I thought it was going to be ordinary at best.  I gave it a shot because the reviews from people who watched it were so great.  This is an excellent movie.  It was suspenseful, and I enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The acting is stellar on everyone's part, and the suspense really builds because the werewolf is only fully shown in a couple of scenes.  I loved this movie, and will watch it again and again.",1499212800,,460,4.364705882352941
7306240,4,B0108N9AAY,"Good low-budget movie, effectively combining the western and horror genres. I would have enjoyed it more if it had much more spooky music, a little more action, and less talking, but overall the acting and story were solid. Amazing that it was an English production with mostly English actors.",1496016000,2,293,5.0
7306241,3,B0108N9AAY,"Not bad.  Some interesting characters and appreciable performances here.  My biggest issue was that the werewolf was really a background character, and the ending felt rushed and unsatisfying.  There was some good potential here.",1493337600,,229,5.676470588235294
7306242,4,B0108N9AAY,This is a good mix of western and horror. It has pretty good acting and an interesting plot. It was much better than I thought it would be. I recommend this movie.,1491782400,2,163,4.125
7306243,4,B0108N9AAY,"I enjoyed this flick. Like the man said, nice western turned werewolf flick and just going with the basics.",1490400000,,107,4.684210526315789
7306244,5,B0108N9AAY,Expected a horrible movie but I was pleasantly surprised.,1490400000,,57,5.444444444444445
7306245,4,B0108N9AAY,"Sometimes more can be done on 18 minutes than 90.  Blood Moon is a good example.  In less than 20 they have set up a full story that makes more sense Ryan some full length movies.

In don't necessarily grade the same for a short as I do for feature length film.  It would be hard to do so.  Thus, this short gets a better grade than some who have spent far more money in the budget.",1488672000,,382,3.909090909090909
7306246,3,B0108N9AAY,Not too bad for a werewolf/shapeshifter flick.  Interesting perspective (western/stagecoach days).,1486425600,,98,7.909090909090909
7306247,2,B0108N9AAY,"It could have been much better. Stilted acting, lame plot and oh yeah the werewolf is outside so lets  face the door with the gun while we stand with our back to the window. Sheesh!!!",1486339200,,183,4.228571428571429

7306252,3,B0108N9AAY,It was okay.,1484006400,,12,3.3333333333333335
7306253,4,B0108N9AAY,A very decent werewolf movie with a Western setting.  This is a new twist on the Skinwalker Navajo legend.  On the night of the blood moon the skinwalkers are all the more powerful.  There is this abandoned town that is now being used as a stagecoach way station where most of the movie takes place.  It is to this place that the Skinwalker is targeting.  You have several people from the stage and a down on his luck gunslinger that come to this town.  The bandits that come later are the only characters that weren't played all that well.  I think the rest of the characters were well played and believable. All in all I would recommend this movie.,1483315200,,650,4.411764705882353
7306254,5,B0108N9AAY,"This may not be a big box office type movie. But well worth a watch. It does have some blood spatters here and there. But not full of blood guts and gore. This is one of the best monster / creature type movies I have seen in a long while. And a western to boot and I like westerns. Loved the line
Oh, he's dead, Then the guy raises up and says  Don't call the undertaker just yet I got things to do.",1482019200,2,399,3.8072289156626504

7306288,3,B0108N9AAY,"I have s oft spot for this kind of low budget horror movie, and this one is kind of fun, despite some flaws. The script tried to do too much with too many characters and too many subplots, but it still had a bit of that solid Weird West vibe.

7306292,4,B0108N9AAY,"I completely enjoyed this movie.  It is an old style movie with no high tech gadgets.  It's a classic western, Gunslinger, rebel hero type, who turned to the gun after bad things happened to his family but still has a conscious.  Bad guy bank robbers, who are just mean.  Lawman, nave American medicine woman or witch.  A saloon lady and a new bride with a secret.  Add to this a good mood setting and a werewolf.  Very good movie, will watch it again.",1473811200,2,452,4.373493975903615
7306293,3,B0108N9AAY,Your basic werewolf mutated to a Skin walker in the old west. A silly yarn but good acting  by  a bunch of almost all Brit actors manages to pull it off.,1473638400,,153,3.903225806451613

7306311,3,B0108N9AAY,"For what is apparently a low budge film, I was surprised that it contained such well-written dialog, visually appealing cinematography and solid, likable actors.  The story holds your interest, though it could have been a little tighter, especially in the wrap-up at the end.  Overall, very watchable.  The only downside -and this is the biggest issue in these kinds of movies - was the werewolf itself. There has to be somewhere that filmmakers can obtain scary and realistic (?) looking costumes on a budget.  This one wasn't the worst, but was really the only ""low budget"" aspect of this film.",1469664000,,596,4.93

7306314,4,B0108N9AAY,"Actually, it's surprisingly good.  It has like 4.5 out of 10 on IMDB and such, but as long as you're not expecting The Shining type of thriller, you're in for a good watch.  Nothing stands out as terrible, which is more than you can say for a lot of cheap thrillers, and is actually quite good in some parts.  Definitely worth a watch if you've got a couple hours to spend.",1468972800,,373,4.225352112676056

7306317,4,B0108N9AAY,"One of the better Western/Horror flicks I have seen in a while.  Some of the dialogue could have been better, but there were some pretty good one-liners.

7306324,3,B0108N9AAY,"""Not terrible"" may not sound like a ringing endorsement, but in the realm of budget horror films, it's pretty good. So many budget horror films seem to be just quick cash grabs, but his one feels more like it was a labor of love for somebody that just didn't have a very big bank account.

Pros:
Nice set
Good costumes
okay acting
interesting premise

Cons:
uneven writing (a couple of things are a little silly)
some dialog was pretty bad
A couple of characters are superfluous, and one of those is built up to be important but ends up having nothing to do with anything really

I can appreciate the fact that the director / producer didn't take the easy way out and CGI everything. Costumes and bipedal werewolves are so much better than oversized CGI wolves.

My problem is that the dialogue was predictable and there were some holes in the film that were not filled when it was over.

The main character of Calhoun is very interesting and I'd love to see a follow up movie featuring his next adventure.  I'd say anyone who enjoys a good werewolf movie will like this one.",1454976000,,432,4.571428571428571

Nor that Eleanor Matsuura wasn't a Native American (she's half Japanese,  half English) unless you happened to recognize the surname. As ""Black Deer""  she is perfection.
Yeah, it's about werewolves...SORT of. That is to say, it's about Skinwalkers, which are not the same as the European Werewolf.  True Skinwalkers (in Legend anyway) were not dependent on the Lunar Cycle nor did they always turn into wolves.
Ravens, Owls, and Coyotes were also part of their regular repertoire but filmmakers have always tended to simplify legends and myths for popular consumption and they do the same with Skinwalkers.

It's a werewolf western with some standard characters - gunslinger, psychopathic bank robbers, the saloon-owning lady, lawmen, and the rough stagecoach driver.  Oh, and a werewolf. Skinwalkers seemed to be common knowledge - maybe a little too common to be plausible.  The ending had a couple of little twists - if that's what they were. If you're looking for continuous gore, this isn't the right movie. It was predictable in spots, but still maintained my interest.  But they killed off a character that surprised me, so it wasn't completely predictable.  If the werewolf was a band of marauding Apaches, it could have almost been a 1960s western. My only real objection was that the movie mostly took place at night, which made the lighting a little too dark at times. I don't regret renting it.",1529107200,,821,4.877697841726619

What brings this down to a 3 star movie is twofold--the side story and the acting. The Sheriff/Indian tracker side plot goes absolutely nowhere. It feels like 30 minutes of that side story was edited out. The acting is just incredulous. Don't get me wrong, it's perfectly fine... when there's not a monster around. When the monster is up in their face, these people have zero fear, zero panic. I've seen people show more emotion going after a housefly that just landed in their salad and then flew away.
