8570414,3,B00BLLIHTI,"The music is grand, but this DVD does not play on my DVD player.  It does, however,  play on my computer.

I have never had this problem before and I do not know if there is something  about the DVD that was not indicated when I decided to buy it.  Oh well.",1371254400,,257,3.8653846153846154
8570415,5,B00BLLIHTI,"""Every time we play at the Boerderij it feels like coming home...""

""Live at the Boerderij"" captures MA at a favourite Netherlands venue on their 2012 Ghost Moon Orchestra Tour , their first DVD since Heather Findlay moved on and Liv Sparnenn took on lead vocals. As usual MA  playing  live fully match if not  exceed their studio sound,  the camera work and follow -up editing all do a great job capturing the spirit of the occasion. Sound quality also worked fine for me throughout (though there are no  Audio or other ""Settings"" Options offered)

Each DVD captures one live set, before and after the bar-break. One quirk:  3 ""bonus ""tracks on DVD 1 , clearly part of the same gig  yet  not part of either Set???  - ""bonus"" just seems to mean they are not on the 2 CD set on sale separately .  FULL SET LIST BELOW.

Since ""GMO"",  Floyd-Gilmour comparisons seem to have given way to  remarked passing resemblances to the likes of  Within Temptation and -more so - Nightwish.  Liv does have a vocal style and range not unlike Annette Olzon, .  Plus of course Troy Donochley  guested on the latest albums of both bands ( When this DVD was filmed Troy was an ocean away ,spoken for on the Nightwish tour-the one that set out with Annette and came home fronted by  Floor Jansen).

All in all  this should well please  MA fans,  go down well with anyone with a taste for prog and ,in parts at least, might well grab some fans of melodic female vocal metal ,more so than earlier MA offerings might have done
Highly recommended!
