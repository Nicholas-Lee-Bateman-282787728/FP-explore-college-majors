4257311,2,B0043RMOYQ,"A badly miscast Pat O'Brien leads an undistinguished cast in this muddled, ponderous noir snoozer about a brooding art historian who finds himself framed for... um... something. It seems that someone is stealing great paintings from a major museum and O'Brien is being set up to take the fall. He shows up disoriented and disshevelled, claiming to have been in a train wreck and yet... no train accidents have been reported in months. For some reason, the cops want to arrest him, and he inexplicably goes on the lam. This is one of those chase films where the character's actions and motivations don't really make much sense, and as a result it's hard to get involved in the plot. It's also not a very moody film, and for a film noir, that's definitely a serious shortcoming. Skippable.",1047600000,6,787,4.751824817518248

8415211,3,B0043RMOYQ,"""Crack-Up"" is a 1946 crime thriller with some classic ""film noir"" themes, directed by Irving Reis and based on the short story ""Madman's Holiday"" by Frederic Brown. George Steele (Pat O'Brien) is an expert on art forgery who works at a Chicago museum as a lecturer and tour guide. One evening, he tries to break into the museum in a frantic state, while a meeting of the museum's board of directors goes on upstairs. When interviewed by police Lt. Cochrane (Wallace Ford), Steele recalls being in a train wreck, and that's the last thing that he remembers. As there have been no train wrecks in the area, Cochrane is suspicious but lets Steele go at the request of a mysterious Mr. Traybin (Herbert Marshall), who wants to have Steele followed, and the museum's director (Erskine Sanford), who wants to avoid scandal. But Steele insists to his ladyfriend Terry Cordeau (Clair Trevor) that he must find out what happened and sets out to retrace his steps.

George Steele is a classic noir protagonist in that he has fallen victim to something, he knows not what or why, and he finds himself unable to trust anyone, even the good guys, who manipulate him for their own ends. The supporting cast is good, but ""Crack-Up"" fails to ever really engage, because O'Brien is dreadfully wrong for this role. George Steele is engaging and even a little bombastic in his art lectures. He draws a crowd. But as a man trying to solve a mystery and reclaim his lost memories, he is dull. Very dull. Practically somnambulant. The story of art forgeries, insurance fraud, and its themes of populism over elitism are convoluted and full of holes, so a strong protagonist is necessary to overcome them. If only the audience could get caught up in Steele's plight...but we can't. That shortcoming is compounded by an attempt to broadly vilify elitism in art and comment about modern technologies used for good and evil, which both feel clumsily contrived.

The DVD (Warner Brothers 2006): This is a DVD-R, manufactured on demand, so there's no telling how well it will hold up. There is no scene menu, but you can use the buttons on your remote to navigate the film in 10-minute intervals. The instant search forward works, but the instant replay does not, so you can't back up. The print and sound are passable. There is some visible damage to the print but not enough to be distracting. The sound could be clearer, but it's also not enough to be distracting. No bonus features or subtitles.",1441929600,,2471,4.744186046511628

8415214,5,B0043RMOYQ,"Although you can guess who the villain is by judging the title, the real premise of Crack-Up is O'Brien's breakdown and his discovery of who is switching forged paintings for the originals?  Claire Trevor has an excellent role as his blonde girlfriend (not a femme fatale) this time who helps him solve the mysteries of the forgeries and thefts of the original paintings.  Some wonderful special effects like the first train crash which leaves O'Brien bewildered.  Did it really happen?  Enjoy this ""intellectual"" film noir!

8415215,4,B0043RMOYQ,"Pat O'Brien sure had his dander up back in the day. In the 1930s he was an unshutuppable firecracker, this fast-talking wise guy. He was one of the rare few who could share screentime with James Cagney and not wilt in the shadows. But in this deft 1946 noir mystery, Pat O'Brien tones down the brash act. CRACK-UP, if you're curious, is based on Fredric Brown's short story ""Madman's Holiday."" I never read it. Didn't hurt my enjoyment of the film.

Pat O'Brien steps outside his comfort zone. Instead of a street-savvy operator, he plays an art expert named George Steele who, as the film opens, seems to have tied one on too many. We eyeball him as he crashes thru the museum's glass door and assaults a police officer. Later and having regained a measure of lucidity, George insists that he had just survived a train wreck, except that a bit of checking informs the police and the museum staff that there hadn't been at all a train wreck. Somewhere around this point, George begins to explain the events that had led up to this moment. The film obligingly veers into an extended flashback sequence.

During the flashback, we're made privy to a few things. We learn that the museum director doesn't approve of how Steele conducts his lectures in the art gallery. He deems Steele's style to be too revolutionary and too comic. This is how the narrative salts away a possible motivation for a deep-seated grudge on Steele's part. We're introduced to Claire Trevor's character who seems to have an understanding with our pal, never mind that she's about to step out with a visiting Brit (Herbert Marshall) for dinner. Anyway, somewhen along here, George Steele gets some bad news over the phone about his mother. He skedadles to catch the train. And that's us caught up to the present. Here's the cop giving George Steele a piece of advice: ""Lay off the vino. Don't take any more train rides. You're liable to end up in Bellevue."" Me, I've taken that advice to heart, and I haven't yet ended up in Bellevue.

CRACK-UP is a well-done flick, marked with expert execution of solid character beats and its riveting Hitchcockian plot. It crackles with sustained suspense. All too soon, a murder is done and George Steele, prime suspect, mental breakdown and all, is forced to go on the run even as he attempts to solve the murder. I won't spoiler things, but I will say that my favorite moments take place in the penny arcade scene. There, our man falls in a bind and has to extricate himself in abrupt fashion. Pat O'Brien's restrained performance works. And there's just enough of that cocky old operator to lend his art expert character some vinegar. CRACK-UP gets fine support from Claire Trevor and from Herbert Marshall who, along with George Sanders, should teach a class on elocution and whose character here projects a mild aura of mystery. But don't be too quick to cast suspicion on him... or, hold on, maybe I'm bluffing. I'm probably handing you a red herring. Go see CRACK-UP already.",1351123200,,2992,4.706106870229007
8415216,5,B0043RMOYQ,"The first time I saw this film noir, I found it really circuitous and hard to follow. Maybe I was just sleepy. Upon viewing it again, I easily followed it and thought it just recondite enough! The setting is the world of fine art masterpieces. Why would a trustworthy longtime employee/art lecturer suddenly enter the gallery one night after closing seemingly raving and out of his mind - run amok?  The unravelling of this mystery is well done and involves the wonderful ""nightmarish"" chiaroscuro lighting and camera angles that are typical of Noir and takes place mainly at night. There are some great scenes on the old trains that were common travel for folks in the '40's. Always love to see those.
Pat O'Brien, Claire Trevor and George Brent all acquit themselves admirably in this little gem. I was happy to see the DVD available and made haste to add it to my Noir collection.",1302134400,15,883,4.696774193548387
8415217,5,B0043RMOYQ,"I love the 1946 movie, ""Crack Up,"" which stars Pat O'Brien, Claire Trevor, and Herbert Marshall. I also love the 1951 movie, ""The Sellout,"" which stars Walter Pidgeon, Audrey Totter, and John Hodiak. The cover art for this DVD is for the former, but the product description is for the latter. Amazon, which movie is this?????",1289433600,5,325,4.821428571428571
8415218,4,B0043RMOYQ,"Yes, it's a dull muddled film noir, but it has some other things going for it.  It has a very sophisticated take on art and bohemia, and if you get the hots for luggy men this is the movie for you.  The visuals are really nice, the train and the dock sequences are calibrated nicely.  Claire Trevor is outstanding throughout, although perhaps one should have doubted her true blue loyalty at some point, maybe her portrayal wasn't finely shaded enough to allow that little sliver of doubt in, that might have made all the difference.  But although Pat O'Brien evidently believes that she is in cahoots with the plotters who are trying to frame him for Stevenson's murder, we the audience never do, not really.  We see that she is deep in the confidence of the character played so somnolently by one-legged Herbert Marshall, and we don't understand until the end that he isn't actually who he seems to be, and yet such is Claire Trevor's all American appeal that we trust our instincts with her.  She may not have much depth as an actress but what she does have, other more highly trained actresses would love to switch and take.

I love her wardrobe too; although disappointingly enough as the movie goes on it gets more prosaic.  But her first scenes show her in an evening gown with jewels draped all over her neck, then they seem to swing up and catch hold of the entire fabric of the the gown, so that she's wearing an entire artillery belt around her decolletage.  Then she puts on a jacket or something that exactly resembles the sexy military garb Janet Jackson marched around with in the dance videos from CONTROL.  I suppose this ridiculous uniform sex look dates back to the illustrations from the OZ books at the turn of the century, with the all-girl army led by General Gin-Jur in her adorable Rasputin gear.

Pat O'Brien, ordinarily a musclebound Joe American, takes a different kind of part for him, he's an art historian with a deep aesthetic sense about Renaissance and later religious painting (and English portrait painting of the 18th century).  Pat O'Brien playing Bernard Berenson?  Sort of!  He doesn't seem exactly comfortable playing the part, and speaks in a deliberately feminine way, his baritone turning tenor around the edges, giving all his speeches that California rising inflection in the final syllable.  Check out the museum scene where he pours scorn on a typical Surrealist painting, apparently a studio takeoff on a Dali painting, but a remarkably sophisticated one, with an unmistakeable likeness to Dali the man right in its center!  I think Dali could have sued and won!  Don't you wish you had that painting today?

The head of the Museum, Barton, looks just like Uncle June in THE SOPRANOS!  He is played by Erskine Sanford, the potato-faced actor who was one of Orson Welles' favorites and who can be spotted in THE STRANGER, MACBETH, JANE EYRE, THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI among other Welles-related productions.  (He played Herbert Carter in CITIZEN KANE.)  Here he's a real mess and I'll give you a dollar if you can figure out what he's doing in that vault the night of poor Stevenson's murder.  I don't think the script writers really figured out who did what to whom, they just saw a great visual opportunity--the train crash that didn't happen--and they ran with it all the way to box office gold.

There's one sequence with a penny arcade, where patrons pay a penny to see some naughty film footage (One machine says, ""1 Night in Paris"" just like the Paris Hilton sex tape of today) in which O'Brien and Trevor attempt to hide from a police APB.  A burly sergeant spots a little boy bending over a peep show pinhole.  ""How old are you, sonny?"" he says irately.  The ""boy"" turns, he's got a thick bushy mustache.  ""I'm 39, how old are you!""",1142726400,5,3816,4.6992481203007515
