In a way, that is the point of the whole movie:  it's such a horrible movie that it's unbelievably funny.  In fact, at one point, you start wondering if the movie is actually meant to be so funny because it is obvious that the film was so very underbudgeted that they could not possibly put together a credible action movie around it, so, you figure, that they decided to turn it into a comedy.

If you could buy this movie for a buck or two and you enjoy ""unintentionally"" funny movies, it's good for an occasional late night's laugh.  You should not bother if you are looking for a ""serious"" movie, however.",1380153600,,747,4.369565217391305
8099039,1,B000CH3W6U,"On the end credits is an amusing set of out-takes from the filming of this absoultely dire movie.
The rest of the movie is not even worth a glimpse. Despite having some decent names involved, the movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. I don't want to describe the movie as it is behind me now, but just look at the reviews on imdb.com and you'll soon see they are all in agreement with each other.
AVOID this film!",1332720000,,417,4.160493827160494
