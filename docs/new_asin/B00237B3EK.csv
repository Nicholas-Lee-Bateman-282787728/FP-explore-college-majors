Are you a fan of mc chris, MC Lars, Frontalot? Do you find yourself watching reruns of Battlestar Galatica, Star Trek, or playing Magic the Gathering? You need to pick up this movie and dive head first into nerdcore hiphop.",1478822400,,269,4.723404255319149

8349702,5,B00237B3EK,Product received in timely fashion and quality as promised. Makes me glad I splurged and bought myself the prime membership.,1361404800,,124,5.25
8349703,5,B00237B3EK,"My producer sent me a link for the trailer to this movie and I was intrigued.  The movie is a great inspiration for any muscian embarking on their first tour.  The interaction between the guys is priceless.  It shows that Frontalot loves his fans.  I even enjoyed the segment where they interviewed people who didn't like the performance.  It definately gave it an unbiased feel and the willingness of the director to show that this wasn't a fluff piece.  A great purchase for anyone who enjoys music, especially the behind the scenes portion.",1285632000,,543,4.78494623655914
8349704,4,B00237B3EK,"I enjoyed this documentary about the inventor of nerdcore hip-hop on his first tour. A little bit of bad language but not excessive and usually appropriate to the situation - I would let a kid 12+ watch this. If you've ever been to a Con (Comic-Con, or a Star Wars Con), you will relate. These are the people that were the A/V club in High School and spent their time playing D&D or Magic the Gathering - now they are rapping and getting some recognition for it.

Pretty funny and a good way to look into your kids' world if you are the parent of the type mentioned above.",1261440000,2,572,4.247706422018348
8349705,5,B00237B3EK,"""Nerdcore Rising"" should be required viewing for anyone interested in social commentary. Every so often a documentary expertly defines a subculture, the way the book ""Speed Tribes"" did for 1990s Japan or ""Roger and Me"" explored America's industrial decline. If you want to learn about this unusual, supremely hidden corner of Americana, this is for you. Bottom line, it sets the bar a whole lot higher for anyone claiming to be a 'pop culture expert'.",1257811200,,451,5.026666666666666
8349706,5,B00237B3EK,Nerdcore Rising was an fun adventure for nerds and non nerds alike. I showed this to my friends on our movie night and everyone had a good time. It's good to see more nerds like myself taking pride and even better to get the story out of an up and comming music genre. Nerdcore Ho!,1253318400,2,281,4.127272727272727
