8342615,5,B001U1L9LC,"This DVD is an absolute must for any lover of contemporary ballet.

Not even talking about his stunning and original choreographic language, I admire Kylian for his perfect pitch in music. If you look through the list of his creations there is no ''''''' mediocrity there. Some even good choreographers would take any ""danceable"" music and create a ballet there. They would take a mediocre and boring piece by say Philip Glass and do their shtick to that music. With Kylian the music is top notch. Svadebka is one of the best pieces Stravinsky ever wrote, I believe he loved to more than other ballets of his, but the Symphony of Psalms is definitely no slouch either.

 It is too bad that the DVD does not have the texts. The text of Psalms is readily available, and it is pretty short. Svadebka is based on old Russian traditional wedding folk songs (that were collected I believe in 19th century by Kireevsky). The ballet is much more revealing if you see the text (although a native Russian speaker I could not understand a word of vocals by ear). It is ridiculous to expect subtitles for a ballet, but for this particular ballet they would be very helpful; plus the lyrics are sometimes hysterically funny. For example addressing the groom friends of the bride sing:
'''' ''' ''''
''''' ''' '''''
which roughly means, ""love her for the soul, but shake her as a pear-tree full of fruit.""  Sometimes they are very poignant and moving, when the mother of the groom bewails the loss of her child stolen from her.",1479772800,,1513,4.634328358208955
