8587322,5,B00CFA8J7O,"There are many videos of the Japanese dance/performance group WORLD ORDER, so I'm assuming that anyone looking for this disc is already familiar with WORLD ORDER's hyper-precision style. Most of WORLD ORDER's performances are choreographed to be viewed from straight-on, so performing at a round venue like the Budokan raises many challenges. I am a big fan of WORLD ORDER, but I would have been quite disappointed if their show had just been a run-through of their best routines straight-on into the camera while 75% of the audience was looking at their sides or backs throughout the show. However, their show was nothing like that, and maybe marks the pinnacle of their group's achievements!

They reworked their moves so that they worked the entire 360 degree view; in addition, they choreographed for the use of overhead cameras as well. They exploited the Budokan's light system to make some of the group seem to disappear and reappear in and out of the shadows, as well as choreographing with the special floor video screens. Musically, their songs were reworked to incorporate a live strings section. No matter how many previous WORLD ORDER videos you may have seen, there is alot of ""WOW!"" to see on this disc.

Camerawork is imaginative and enjoyable to watch. There is a track circling the stage where 2 cameras keep circling and providing footage, as well as direct overhead shots and some further camera work shot in an almost tilt-shift effect incorporating not only the group on stage but also the huge bell-like overhead video system that makes for some interesting shots. I haven't seen anything like this, nor been as constantly entertained by the showmanship of a ""concert"" movie since Talking Heads' STOP MAKING SENSE. Image is sharp, colors are vivid, and sound quality is also very clear.

Lastly, the packaging and presentation gets a full 5 stars. It's a nice color, solid, thick cardboard fold-out box with the disc on one side (printed with a circular motif from the show), a large booklet (Japanese text), and a small flip book (!); all 3 items arranged bento-style.

Japanese text, Japanese dialog, Japanese lyrics (with some English) - but of course I had been expecting that since this disc was intended for the Japanese market. However, it played perfectly in my 4 year old Samsung blu ray player that I bought off the shelf at the local Target.",1520380800,2,2375,4.915211970074813
