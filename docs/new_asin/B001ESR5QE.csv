8299477,3,B001ESR5QE,"Movies starring black actors were few and far between in the 50's and 60's so it was always a treat to see colored people on the big screen in non-stereotypical roles. This movie was originally released as MARK OF THE HAWK in 1958.  ""Shaka-Lulu"" tells a decent story of native unrest in ""pre-independent/colonial""  Africa.  Poitier is superb as usual while Eartha is ""muy interesante""! This Classic Black movie belongs in every African-American film library.",1372636800,2,458,5.162162162162162
8299478,3,B001ESR5QE,"This movie has already been released under another name THE MARK OF THE HAWK. How this company can get away with selling that movie under a different title is beyond me. If you already have the MARK OF THE HAWK , you don't need this one.",1340496000,2,237,4.173913043478261
