8369580,3,B002FY7WT6,"This collection of light, chatty post-WWII comedies from Renown Pictures likely won't add much to your appreciation of British wit, but will pass the time agreeably with a few standout performances (Peter Sellers in 'Z Men,' in particular) and occasionally inspired silliness.  For better examples of Anglo humor-- via superior writing and directing-- invest in the Ealing, Guinness and Sellers sets, all by Anchor Bay.  VCI's prints are in universally good shape; three films on each of two single-sided discs.  Content combined rates about 2 1/2 stars, presentation (no substantive extras) 3 1/2.",1410307200,4,598,5.408602150537634
