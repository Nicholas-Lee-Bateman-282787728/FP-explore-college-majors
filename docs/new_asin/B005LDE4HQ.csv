8478080,5,B005LDE4HQ,"Truly inpriring .. This is a must for all pregnant women for, not just excercise, but confidence and to trust in their own body and wisdom in connection with their baby .. Cannot speak enough praise about this amazing product.",1446163200,2,226,4.675
8478081,2,B005LDE4HQ,"PROS:  She teaches through each type of move precisely and breaks it down into different sections (Hip circles, figure 8, arms, etc).  It would be good for anyone who wants to SERIOUSLY learn to bellydance.

CONS:  I found this video extremely boring, I never looked forward to doing it.  There is no section where you ""just dance"", it's only exercises/practice movements.  I did not enjoy the music at all... found myself having to turn the TV on mute and play my own music just to get through the disc.  I am not a serious bellydancer... I just heard it would help with labor and wanted to learn the moves and have some fun.  This disc was way too serious for me and I wish I had purchased the ""perfect pregnancy bellydance"" video instead.",1412208000,,741,4.518796992481203
8478082,5,B005LDE4HQ,"You know how they say we store memories and feelings in our bodies? Touching or working a certain part of your body can bring up and release stored emotional tension. I didn't really believe that until I started using this dvd.

I started using these movements as a form of exercise, but soon discovered that they were inexpensive and effective psychotherapy. One day at about 32 weeks, I was innocently going about some small hip circles, moving one slow step at a time across my yoga mat in the living room, when I felt a geyser of emotion inside me. I was acutely aware that the emotion came out of my body, from doing the movements. It felt good, like a release. This experience repeated itself, to a lesser extent, numerous times while doing the movements she recommends. I've come to believe it was a releasing of past emotional trauma stored in my pelvic area. Psychotherapy for the body.

I don't expect everyone will have this same experience because we are all so different and bodies are so weird. But if it can happen to you, I expect this dvd will bring you to that place.

Unlike most exercise I've done, including my original experience with belly dancing, dancing with Maha felt like my body moving me rather than me exercising control over my body. A supple, rhythmic movement of my birthing muscles, this spiraling, circling, and rocking made me stronger. And it really works in labor!

When I was in labor with my third baby, I used the cervix spiral to jump-start labor. I'm not even sure this is possible, but I swear I actually felt my cervix opening. It felt a lot different than doing the exercise while not in labor, like it was causing the stretching of a big, fat rubber band. Intense, but good.

Belly dancing this way in pregnancy and during labor helped to slow and center and ground me. It helped me stay in the moment and just be with my body and my baby. I believe Maha Al Musa's gentle, spiritual approach to the movements made all the difference.",1409875200,2,1981,4.553370786516854
8478083,5,B005LDE4HQ,"I really love this DVD, actually both of them. The first one with the dancing is so empowering and, for me, the moves just felt right, comforting, pleasurable. The other DVD, where we see The Birth was very educating. All in all, I'd definitely recommend this DVD set for all women pregnant or trying to be.",1403568000,3,307,4.5
8478084,5,B005LDE4HQ,"my first wasn't a nice experience at all.was hell.but i used this for my second and i absolutely loved the birth!!!!! i felt in control,it eased the pain,was calming and it quickened the pace.would recommend all mothers to use.no experience in dancing needed at all. i also have hip joint pains which this DVD helped with.had a natural water birth with no pain killers unlike my first.my husband knew i was going to use this technique so he helped me along since he knew what to do and expect. i didn't have months or weeks to practice as i only bought it in my 8th month (never knew about it before)and i had my baby 3 weeks early.but the little practice i did of those moves was easy enough to remember and i used the ones that i felt my body needed at that time to help with the pain and baby. i used those moves thru the whole of labour and birth.having more kids in the future depended a lot on this birth as i had a hell of a time with my first. all i can say is i look forward to having a third at the right time and ill definitely be using this technique again.it was amazing! managed to get through all the contractions calmly and to actually anticipate and sort of ""enjoy"" them.not to enjoy the pain but to enjoy their coming knowing i could manage and im getting through them well till the end without losing control or panicking or having too much of a hard time to continue.
my first was 23 hrs of labour this one was only 5 and a half hrs! and i loved EVERY MINUTE of it. my baby was also born placid an calm something i was told happens to those who have a water birth and an enjoyable (so to speak) labour.
recommend to all mothers! deff something to use or at least try out once. no two births and labour are ever the same but this technique deff helps with easing it and coping.",1394582400,5,1796,4.163793103448276
8478085,5,B005LDE4HQ,"Just doing the warm up is worth the price. The rest of the dvd is for doing/mastering specific moves, Maha's birth, and interviews. Doing the warm up moves definitely helped my hips stay loose and flexible during my pregnancy and they helped me quietly and concentratedly manage the pain during my natural childbirth. I would recommend this to everyone, pregnant or not.",1382659200,3,370,4.983870967741935
8478086,5,B005LDE4HQ,"I can attest to the efficacy of her moves and instructions on this DVD that she teaches you to use during birthing.  This was my fourth birthing and third natural childbirth.  I can vouch for the lessening of discomfort if you use the tools she teaches you.  Everything about this birth was the same as my others except I used this DVD when I felt contractions.  It wasn't hard to remember because it felt like such a 'release'.  I thought for the few days before that I was having braxton hicks....again.  I had NO IDEA after 3 contractions on the day of that the baby 'was here'.  There was no time to fill up the birthing pool and my husband caught our little baby (we had called the midwife just 3 minutes before to tell her....birthing was 'beginning').  I loved the preciseness of this DVD.  I purchased 2 other prenatal bellydance DVDs before this one.  They were NOT specific enough.  They were short and sorry to say a little cheesy.  They both sorely lacked adequate instructions.  I did not feel that they did a well enough job at describing the anatomy of bellydance.
I.e.  How do I tilt my pelvis?  Which direction should my torso be facing, etc.  I had pelvic girdle pain with my 2nd pregnancy and I knew that I wasn't taking any chances ever getting it again by 'guessing' at things like positioning etc while exercising.  I hope this helps you decide to choose this DVD over others.  It is so worth the extra money and investment to receive such a well-rounded, educational and professionally done product.  You and your baby are worth it!",1332201600,13,1555,4.548736462093863
8478087,5,B005LDE4HQ,"For a while now I've been watching and working with sections of the Maha Al Musa's 2-DVD set, Dance of the Womb: A Gentle Guide to Belly Dance for Pregnancy and Birth (which I received as a review copy), and I'm happy that I've played with all of it just at the right time in my pregnancy.

In what sense? Dance of the Womb is much less a workout, and much more a guide to and meditation on connecting with your body to have the best pregnancy and birthing experience possible. To be frank, I don't think I would have appreciated it very much in my second trimester -- I did take some peeks into the program, but was not moved to work with it just yet. And I was lucky to have a pretty active third trimester, for the most part, which enabled me to take on more challenging prenatal programs and even normal dance DVDs. But working with Dance of the Womb as everything in my body is starting to get heavy and painful, and as labour itself approaches, has been just right.

Dance of the Womb has two very different components. One DVD contains a short film of Maha's home birth of her third child. Between beautifully-shot landscape scenes, photographs, and videos of the birth itself are interspersed interviews with Maha's midwives. This is an intensely personal film, and really, for lack of a better word, quite amazing. Again, I think this isn't something I appreciated so much earlier on in my pregnancy, but as I've come to see how many of the women I know wound up with cesarean sections recently (the vast majority), I've wound up more passionate about being able to labour naturally and with a minimum of interference. I would be too nervous to have a home birth, at least right now, but seeing that it's possible, and seeing Maha do it, is truly inspiring at this point in my pregnancy.

It's also inspiring in a practical way. Labour is a long process in many cases, and very different from what they show in the movies. Actually, it's also quite different from the movies I saw in the Lamaze class on dealing with pain naturally and in the hospital's prepared childbirth class. Those tend to be shorter and to focus on the last, most painful part of the first phase of labour (transition) and the birth itself. As astounding as all of those births are, the videos themselves make the process look rather horrifying and unmanageable. The documentary in Dance of the Womb has a lot of shots of Maha walking and moving around, and as boring as this probably is to someone not currently with child, it's great to see how she manages most of labour, and that she can manage it.

The first DVD contains the dance program itself. This is broken down into the following chapters:

Warm Ups (45 min)
The Circle (26 min)
The Spiral (9 min)
The Figure 8 (12 min)
The Cervix (4 min)
The Hands & Arms (13 min)
The Chest (7 min)

This is, as should be obvious, an enormous amount of instruction and practice time. What this means, practically, is that it was a little tricky for me to get started with it. I really had consciously to set aside a good chunk of time for it, and even then had to break it apart into two sessions. Again, this makes sense at the end of pregnancy, as I wind down from the usual pace of my work and more carefully take time to take care of myself.

The Warm Up is a program all on its own, comprised of a variety of yoga-based stretches and movements for improving bodily mobility. The instruction is incredibly precise, and the pace is slow. There is much focus on concentration and breath. Despite the fact that I've done what feels like a million prenatal workouts by now, I was still surprised by how many movements in this section were new to me. They effectively stretch every part of the body (every part), and are quite satisfying. I'll add that I was working with this during a pretty high anxiety week, and it really helped to calm me down.

The subsequent chapters are all dance based, but also all subtly different from each other. Each takes as its focus either a part of the body or a basic shape associated with bellydance, and each teaches bellydance movements. However, some chapters are structured like more typical dance instruction, and teach you movements and variations on them (like the figure 8), while others introduce a basic shape or idea and then have you move and improv freely (hands & arms). Instruction is detailed and from the ground up -- while I picked up some new things, a woman who had never bellydanced before in her life could learn to do these movements comfortably and safely. Moreover, Maha often gives tips on using the particular movement in childbirth, especially when the form would be different for labour than it would be in ""proper"" bellydance.

The key sections are the circle and the spiral, probably because those are the most elemental movements both for bellydance and for birthing. The focus here is really not on dancing in a performance sense, but on using the movements to enter a meditative, trance-like state. And it works, at least for me. Again, this is a quality of the video that I think makes it less suitable for an energetic early pregnancy, but fabulous for the end stretch. If I go into labour tomorrow (and this is not unlikely), I will probably play the circle and spiral chapters and move along with them.

You have to be creative to figure out how to suit the program to your needs. The 45-minute warmup would be enough for any day, and does incorporate some of the bellydance moves too. You could do the warmup and then a variety of chapters, or just some of the chapters on their own. The pace is slow and careful enough that I don't think a lengthy warmup is really necessary.

Dance of the Womb: A Gentle Guide to Belly Dance for Pregnancy and Birth is a valuable compendium of preparation, information, and inspiration for birth.",1331769600,17,5834,4.530864197530864
8478088,5,B005LDE4HQ,"I am 32weeks and can't speak to using these moves in labor, but I am so much more comfortable in my pregnancy.  My hip pain (which was chronic) is gone. Also, she is so gentle and spiritual while giving useful tips. I am much more relaxed about the whole labor process after spending so much time with these dance moves. I recommend it to all pregnant women",1320451200,4,357,4.3283582089552235
