7316463,4,B010T2TA0E,"Lost After Dark is the latest in a movement of films that try to bring back 80's horror to the masses. Whether that ever happens or not, I give them credit for trying and for giving starving fans of Slasher flicks something to feed on. They really put an effort to get the 80's feel right with the music, the clothing and the hair. Rubik Cube, Crimped hair, rotary phone all along with a lengthy shot of a picture of Ronald Reagan in one of the houses that got a good chuckle out of me. It really does feel like your average slasher movie and It's not just in the way it looks, it's also the way it feels while viewing. That was intended. If no one told you it wasn't made in the 1980's you might never see the difference or that it's not 1987. The presentation, the effects, the gore and visuals are all part of your usual slasher flick experience. They wanted to isolate you in this place where it feels just like horror of yesterday years and while the movie doesn't always succeed at all it's attempting, it manages to do take you back to the past efficiently.

The film is set in 1984 and l must admit it does feel like it. I had my doubts but it kept feeling more and more 80's as it went on (although l don't remember rap being popular). It goes like this : A group high school friends decide to ditch on the prom and go to a cabin instead. They steal a high school bus and are well on their way, until it breaks down. They find a presumingly abandoned house and seek refuge. Some horrific discoveries (think Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and a few urban legends later the madness begins. The horror movie clich stereotypes are all here (wouldn't we miss them?): Virgin girl, tough rebel girl, other girl, nice likeable jock, the power couple, scared black guy and fat guy who never scores with the girl. I can imagine a lot of details went into these characters as the director is clearly a knowledgeable fan of horror and particularly 80's slasher films. It was fun to watch these characters and the unfolding events and reminisce about ""oh she reminds me of..."" and ""this is kinda like..."". There's definitely some influences that can be felt in Lost After Dark. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Friday The 13th being the most obvious ones. Even a little comedy at the expense of A Nightmare On Elm Street.

The kills are satisfying. One scene in particular involves a knife and an eye and ... Well you can probably figure out the rest for yourself. And then there's your typical ""insert weapon of choice"" gruesome kill; visual and bloody. Nothing that involves too much gore or anything that has to do with today's ""Torture Porn"". The ones who survive or in for the long haul are not those you'd ever think of by a long stretch. It seems to throw some notion of horror ""rules"" away and does what you don't expect it to. You see some of it coming but throws some curves here and there. Earlier in the film there seemed to be emphasis on one of the girls and you think she might end up being a heroine (a Nancy or a Tina in Slasher jargon) , only to be one of the first victims.

In the end, l do believe the intention with Lost After Dark was for it to feel like your typical 80's horror flick and a mindless Slasher-fest. Either that or it attempted to be a great long-lost movie that you've never heard of. The movie poster would lead you to draw similar conclusions with it's ""And you thought the 80's were dead..."" and ""Retro 80's horror done right"" quotes. It's not unbelievably great horror, but it's exactly what it promised to be and it delivers. I got what l was promised here. It's fun, gory in that Tom Savini way and pays homage the 80's respectfully. If you're expecting anything other than a homage or a vintage feel, it's all on you. A lot of other movies attempted to do this type of thing but Lost After Dark is the real deal. You've seen similar movies for sure, and that's exactly the point. Enjoy the ride and the flashbacks. Oh and the 80's called they want their 80's back. 4 stars.",1440892800,12,4004,4.357429718875502
7316464,4,B010T2TA0E,"Lost After Dark is for folks who love those 1980s slasher flicks, whether well made or schlocky. This film uses familiar elements of 80s horror to get the tone just right. Its the high school Spring Ball, 1984. Adrienne (Kendra Timmins), a straight-A student, joins her quarterback boyfriend Sean (Justin Kelly) and some friends in sneaking out of the school dance to spend time at her cabin. Their party plans hit an obstacle when they run out of gas on a deserted road. Heading out on foot, they discover a rundown farmhouse where they hope to find help. Instead they find themselves at the mercy of Junior Joad (Mark Wiebe), a cannibal killer from an urban legend. After the brutal murder of one of their friends, the groups quest for help becomes one of desperation and survival.

Clearly, director Ian Kessner is a fan of 80s-era horror, since he gets nearly everything right, including simulated splices, scratches, and reel changes (which occur only at the beginning). Those who know the genre will see references to Friday the 13th, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, He Knows Youre Alone, Maniac, Mothers Day, Prom Night, and many others. The script works as both an homage to the past and an addition to the genre.

The movie never achieves the status of a Psycho, but thats part of the fun. These slasher films were turned out practically weekly in attempts to duplicate the impressive box office of Friday the 13th and Halloween. They were embraced by those who liked their horror bloody and graphic, and Lost After Dark caters to the same audience.

Unlike the characters in Scream, those in Lost After Dark are not horror-flick savvy, so they don't comment on their predicament with references to horror films. They are unaware of potential danger and make all the wrong decisions  just like typical 80s horror movie teens.

There are no bonus features on the widescreen Blu-ray release.",1440892800,,1895,4.854489164086687
7316465,4,B010T2TA0E,"The film takes place in Broomfield, Michigan 1984 (filmed in Canada, okay.). GO LANCERS! Four teen couples take off for a nearby cabin, but run out of gas along the way, making their way to the minor subplot home of the proverbial feral slasher cannibal. The opening of the film attempts to do an old grindhouse film by having film marks ingrained in it, something that didn't work really great in ""Planet Terror."" However, instead of doing the entire feature this way, they just do the opening scene, while the rest of the film is in crisp digital, except for one critical scene where they pull the ""scene missing"" film burning nonsense. The movie uses stuff from the 80's such as a Rubik's Cube, mix cassette tape, LPs decorating the wall, T-shirts, magazines, clothes with studs, pot that requires a few joints to get high, and a picture of Reagan. Robert Patrick plays a politically incorrect principal. Perhaps he was another 80's throwback.

The film had the token Black Guy (Stephan James) and virgin (Kendra Leigh Timmins) so we know who dies first and who survives...right? After they discover the slasher, the plan is to wait it out in his house until morning rather than to run away in different directions. Otherwise the film would be too short. It does contain some humor, but only when you consider it as a spoof of 80's slashers.

7316466,1,B010T2TA0E,"Another half-hearted homage to 1980s slasher movies starts off with actual promisethe period details and music are above average for this type of thing, the production values are solid and the cast looks reasonably period appropriate.  The film opens like a tongue-in-cheek parodythe cassette the characters are listening to is labeled Killer Mix; characters call the house they are about to enter a death trap, not realizing how right they are, another character is dismissed as being Clueless (which would actually be a 90s reference)all silly and mild stuff that is playful without being funny.

Eventually Lost After Dark shifts gears completely and turns into a straight body count moviebut not one that resembles an actual 1980s slasher pic.  Lost After Dark feels an awful lot like a third-rate Wrong Turn knock-off that somebody tried to dress-up with some superficial 1980s elements.

In the 1980s slasher genre there were some pretty basic rules that were laid out explicitly in Scream.  Sex was linked with death and the characters who had sex suffered grisly, horrible murderbut in Lost After Dark there is no sex.  In a genuine 1980s slasher pic the virginal girl is the one who survives when everyone else gets killed around herwhich is not the case here even though there is an obvious candidate for the good girl part.  After Lost After Dark shifts gears it feels nothing whatsoever like a 1980s slasher pic, features no memorable gore and no imaginative murders.  Without the sweet, virginal girl we know is supposed to survive Lost After Dark leaves the audience with nobody to root forjust a collection of interchangeable victims and a killer with zero personality who we rarely see.  There actually might be two murderers but the movie cares so little about the mythology surrounding the house and its murderous family it's hard to tell for sure.

It would be nice if someone who is actually a fan of the 1980s slasher genre made a homage instead of people who clearly have no understanding or knowledge of the genre.  Eli Roth's fake trailer for Thanksgiving from Grindhouse is probably the most perfect 1980's slasher homage I have ever seen--and if Machete hadn't been such a dud maybe the planned full-length version of Thanksgiving would have actually been made.  Lost After Dark, on the other hand,  would be lousy as a straight Wrong Turn type horror film but as a supposed homage to 1980s slasher films it's a complete failure.",1440201600,13,2455,4.9440389294403895
7316467,5,B010T2TA0E,"Horror movies from the late 1970s to mid 1980s are my favorite. I usually don't like modern horror movies. However, this movie was very good. The actors didn't just phone in a ""scary movie"" performance. If you like the original Halloween this movie is in the same vein. I hope there are sequels.",1440115200,7,295,4.584905660377358
7316468,5,B010T2TA0E,"(Lost After Dark) is the best back to the 80s homage slashers I have ever seen and there have been quite a few that I've liked.

There are several reasons this one works so well, this story takes place in 1984 and the styling which includes hair,costume and makeup are spot on. The characters consisted of the usual stereotypes,although they mixed up some of the basic rules that usually pertain to each character..The kills were very satisfying and well done,very apropos for the era the film was depicting .

The use of lighting,location and set were perfection,and the acting was spot on as well. I really can't find fault with anything. The story is about a group of kids that hijack a school bus and head off to one of the girls cabin for the weekend, only they run out of gas and have to stay in the old farmhouse\slaughterhouse where a notorious family of cannibal killers(The Joads) lived years ago.

Little do they know Jr. Joad survived and will be terrorizing them during their short stay. Joad is creepy looking enough to evoke some scares and he really knows how to dole out the pain. Watch the film until the end credits as there is one more scene after.

I give this a very huge thumbs up especially if you're a retro Slasher fan.",1440115200,10,1245,4.52
7316469,3,B010T2TA0E,"I'm still trying to figure out what I think of this movie "" Lost After Dark"". I can honestly say that I didn't totally hate it.
Let me point out the things that I didn't like first. There was next to no character development, so you really could care less about any of the characters. The only character that they tried to give a story to, didn't matter, because she was slaughtered first ( and I MEAN slaughtered!).
They tried their best to do what they could to try to give this movie an 80's retro feel. I feel like in some ways, they tried too hard. I thought I was going to be seeing the girls carrying around Cabbage Patch Kids dolls and yes, there was a Rubix Cube. They should have used cameras or film to really give it that retro look. A great example of a newer film that looks like it was from yesteryear, is ""The House Of The Devil"".
The all original soundtrack was cheesy but passable. The acting wasn't as terrible as a lot of horror movies. The killer looked like Rob Zombie or at least his brother. However, I'd like to say that under all that beard and mess, ole Junior Joad really cleans up well. He is actually the totally HOT actor, Mark Wiebe. I loved him in the Hallmark or Lifetime Christmas movie "" A Very Merry Mix Up"". Though Mark and most of the other cast members are newer to the movie game, they did manage to secure one really big name. Robert Patrick. You might remember him from ( Terminator 2, The Unit, X Files, True Blood, Sons of Anarchy and a million other big moves and TV shows). Robert played Mr. C, an Ex Vietnam War vet, now turned fast car driving, disco blasting, High School Principal.

I know that they wanted to do something clever by having the film look melted and say ""Reel Missing"" when the girl gets her foot caught in a bear trap ( the second bear trap used in the movie, btw) but I think we the viewers felt a bit cheated, since there was no way she could have gotten out of that situation, especially with the sexy Mark.. err I mean Junior right on top of her. Also, was this girl made of steel? She basically had tiny ankle socks on and skin tight spandex pants. A bear trap would have ripped her foot and leg to shreds, yet, not only does she run and get along really well, but she manages to fall off a roof of a house and still keeps on getting on? I do not think so. On the upside, if she wanted to audition for ""Fame"" or ""Flashdance"" she'd be ready to go!

You have eight of the dumbest and the worst friends a friend could ever have, who obviously all live by the motto, ""everyone for themselves""! Let's let our friend get strung up like a mutilated scarecrow but save our own asses instead. The ""tough girl"" just stands there as her friend gets his eye slowly impaled on a broken window ( that looked more like a knife than a shard of glass, btw). I mean, she could have filed and painted her nails in the time it took him to get killed. Yet she just stood there watching and screaming. Completely useless.

Until the movie really starts going (i.e. the murders, about the middle to the end) it is one long, drawn out boring movie. This would have been a great chance to do that character development that they never do. Unless of course you count the one girl saying ""oh yeah, by the way, my sister went missing and this peace sign necklace belongs to her, because I gave it to her"". Of course, her wonderful friends really don't even care and the subject is dropped.

These were some cold, unfeeling teenagers. I mean, the one girl broke her own cute little doggie's neck to save her own life. That's one cold ass b@#ch. Wait, is this the cast of teens from ""The Rivers Edge""?

Now onto the things I did like. There were some pretty good kills. The HOT hunk, Mark Wiebe was in it. Oh did I mention that Mark Wiebe was in it? Of course, the brilliant Robert Patrick , some super groovy and totally rad disco music. Though it sounded more contemporary than retro, but I'll let that one go.

I LOVE the 80's New Wave song "" I'm Not There"" by John Kessler,Ariel Rechtshaid and Justin Raisen, that was used in the film. Though it is not an official release, I was able to find it. It's awesome!

Also interesting to note, Every male victim is named after a slasher film director (i.e. - Wes 'Craven', Johnnie 'Carpenter', Tobe 'Hooper', Sean 'Cunningham'). Every female is named after a final girl actress from the classics (Heather 'Lagenkamp', Jamie 'Lee Curtis', Marilyn 'Burns', Adrienne 'King').

OOOPS.. Continuity
On the bus when Wesley switches cassette tapes and puts a rap one in, he actually puts in a copy of Mr. Big's ""Lean Into It."" It's a rock album, and even if Wes recorded over it with rap music, it still doesn't take into effect that Lean Into It came out in 1991, almost 7 years after this movie took place.

All in all, it's not the greatest, could be better, enjoyable and watchable.

My biggest complaint is that we did not get to see a shirtless Mark Wiebe. Now c'mon guys, that's a total waste of pure eye candy.",1464480000,,5000,4.315228966986155

7316472,4,B010T2TA0E,"Compared to most new movies this 80s throwback looks like a masterpiece however it is basically a remake of the 80s film madman. Robert Patrick steals the show. The negatives are that the film is too dark; everything is at night and the effects are wasted because they can barely be seen.  Also like most 80 slashers you have to suspend all logic in order to enjoy this movie, especially the scene where the teenager drops his glasses, can't see to find them, and his friend just runs off and leaves him there by himself.",1461974400,,521,4.484210526315789

7316479,5,B010T2TA0E,"PLOT..
In a homage to 80's slasher films, a group of teenagers looking to party get stranded when their ride breaks down, they discover an old house in the woods and decide to stay the night and end up being stalked by a cannibalistic killer.

To be honest I wasn't expecting much from this when I first heard of it, as most of these types of modern made 80's homages are usually hyped up by the filmmakers and small time horror websites etc. But this is actually rather good! there are many movies done in the 80's style but this one copies the old slasher routine quite well with a decent large cast of teens for the slaughter, the 80's look is reasonably authentic and after a while you slip into the feeling it was made in the 80's, it has all your clique moments like the killer picking them off one by one, smoking weed, hot girls (no nudity though?) the kills are pretty frequent especially more in the second half, they are not major gore or anything but quite bloody at times and are all good practical effects, the killer is pretty decent, nothing on Jason or Leatherface and certainly won't ever become an icon but its a really great throw back to cheesy 80's slashers and deserves some credit for the great effort, I like the classic ending which leaves it open for a sequel, which I hope does at some point happen raising the bar a little higher maybe! if your a horror fan and like the old slasher out in the woods style horrors then this is really worth checking out!!

7316486,3,B010T2TA0E,"As a teen from the 80's I can't say that I agree with the throwback marketing rhetoric.  There are some great horror films/franchises that came out of the 80's, even when only considering the low budget offerings. This film aspires to be a throwback to mediocre/bad 80's horror at best, but really has nothing remotely original or inspired to bring to the genre.  Aside from seeming rather unambitious, if not pointless, it's almost mocking of the era, as if the producers/director/writer (whichever the case may be) wasn't there, or doesn't have enough genuine respect for the era to offer something more sincere.  It's not a terrible film, despite the stereotyped sensibilities and fake print damage, all the way to the completely ridiculous missing reel.  It has a few things going for it, like being a horror that doesn't stoop to softcore porn ambitions.  But, personally, I'd rather invest my time and/or money in re-visiting one of the genuine classics of the era than what amounts to a half-hearted wannabe.",1446768000,,1015,4.982248520710059

David Lipper is very grounding as the concerned, slightly Oedipal single father of a beautiful teenage girl.  The rest of the cast are great and the script brings subtle twists to the iconic clich of 80's horror victim characters.  Just when you think you know who is going to die next, someone else does and so the suspense builds masterfully.

I give it credit for creative kills, but that alone doesn't outweigh the sheer dullness of the rest of the film.  This is simply a mere novelty.

7316504,4,B010T2TA0E,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

After the release of GRINDHOUSE a plethora of movies were released all using that format as tributes to the movies found in those 42nd Street theaters or drive ins across the country. A few weren't too bad but the majority of them were terrible. Its nice that film makers wanted to keep that genre of film alive but they often overdid rather than catch the essence of those films.

LOST AFTER DARK attempts to capture that sort of movie and for the most part does a fine job. If you grew up in the eighties and watching the tons of slasher films that were released at that time then chances are youll enjoy this movie. Not only does it do a fine job of recreating that atmosphere quite well it also turns it upside down at the same time.

Taking place in the eighties the movie revolves around a group of teens who are skipping the high school dance and heading for the cabin in the woods that belongs to Adriennes (one of the girls) father. Adrienne represents the good girl, the one who hasn't done it yet and who may do so on this trip with her boyfriend Johnny, the jock of the group. Yes, there are designated stereotypes among the group. To get to the cabin the group steals a school bus which sets off the schools vice Principal Mr. C (Robert Patrick).

On their way to the cabin the bus stops running, It turns out theyve stolen the one bus with a broken gas gauge. Sean, the tough guy of the group, forces Tobe, the nerd and supplier of all things weed related, to go find a gas station or help. He send Marilyn along with him knowing that Tobe has a thing for her. Of course they bond while walking. Theyre going leaves behind Heather, the rich girl and Seans girlfriend, Wesley, the token black friend and Jamie, Adriennes friend, and the aforementioned trio.

Tobe and Marilyn find an old house with a mailbox out front that reads JOAD that seems abandoned and look for a phone but the place is devoid of all things modern. They head back to the bus and take everyone back to the house with them. Why they think this ramshackle place would be safer than the bus or that they could find something more useful here than waiting for someone on the road is one of those now famous plotline that never make sense but set up the story perfectly.

Tobe and Marilyn are looking in the barn when she begins to ask him if he thinks Wesley might be interested in her. While hes crushed by her comment Tobe offers her support. As they leave, he loses his glasses and she goes ahead. Unfortunate for him because Junior Joad still hangs around the house and ends up using barbed wire to strap Tobe to the barn door.

In the house while searching for flashlights or anything they can use the group discovers an upstairs room where a sort of altar has been created using skulls, human bones, jewelry and I.D.s from numerous people. This is when they remember the stories they heard long ago about the Joad family of cannibals who lived in an old house in the woods. Marilyn rejoins them and before they can hightail it out of there they hear Tobes screams. Finding him stuck to the barn door they're torn as to whether they should help him or go for help. When Junior turns up the decision becomes much easier. So of course they run back into the house.

So there you have it, the set-up of the story complete with the newest member of the ever growing family of film slashers. What happens from here on out should be simple enough to figure out since almost all slasher films are the same. The kids run, the kids hide, and the kids get killed off one at a time. But who and when becomes the interesting part of this movie.
As I said from the start this movie is pure tribute to those classic slasher films of the eighties. Whats good about this one is that they capture the fell of those movies perfectly, from the characters involved to the setting the movie takes place in. To cap it off the acting is actually quite good even if portions of the performances are done so over the top bad as to be done on purpose. The cinematography is well done and were able to see well enough in the dark here to know whats going on at least.

On the down side the movie uses the whole scratched film from time to time to make it seem like this is an old drive in classic. Had they done that from start to finish it might have worked but instead it happens at the beginning and end as well as several times in between. They also have the film catch in the projector and burn resulting in a missing reel warning flash on screen. Had these things not been overplayed after GRINDHOUSE they might have added something, now they just seen like the norm.

All in all the movie is a fun time. No, it won't be found on any Oscar list but it does do a better job of capturing the feel and look of those old slasher films better than most. It doesnt set out to reinvent the genre but does pay tribute to it in the best way possible. If you're a horror fan then my guess is youll have a good time with this one.",1443484800,,5041,4.280167890870934
7316505,5,B010T2TA0E,"The 80's are back!!!

This throwback appears to have been done with a lot of love and admiration for
the days when films like Friday the 13th, Madman, The Burning and Halloween II,
were all the rage at drive-in's & local cinemas alike.

The director & actors got all of the details right, save for the boombox blaring what
sounded like modern Rap music.
The story, while familiar, was dead on.
The gore & kills were old school & creative (That shard of glass though, ouch....)
There was even an outside reference to Italian gore maestro, Fulci's Zombie (see
above reference to shard of glass).
While the killer lacked a mask & resembled Rob Zombie, he was still menacing
enough for 80's style horror.

One interesting touch (no spoilers!) actually reversed the 80's formula, though.
Without giving too much away, it happens with one of the earliest kills.
I did not expect that to happen to that particular character.
Clever!

Overall, i enjoyed it quite a bit.
It's not using metaphors & trying to be ""The Babadook.""
It's main goal is to drag you back to the 80's, where characters like Jason
existed only to be relentless killing machines.
With that in mind, this film succeeds.

As AC/DC once said:

If you want blood, you got it.",1443225600,3,1233,4.658986175115207

The plot is nothing original and the acting is pretty bland all around. Robert Patrick is great as the school teacher who served in Vietnam and steals the show. The gore is decent and there's some decent humor as well. It's a fun slasher that's worth checking out if you like 80's horror movies or slashers.

7316507,4,B010T2TA0E,Pleasant surprise. This film is full of 80s horror references and it holds true to the horror fans of the slasher genre.  I was on the edge of my seat the whole film.  The fact that u think that a certain character is the one to be the hero and then they are offed first is a cool twist in my opinion.  The film is a total slasher 80s homage.  The only down side to this film is that the killer is not wearing a mask or trying to conceal himself like in the 80s slashes he is very up front and very personal.,1443052800,,508,3.855769230769231
7316508,5,B010T2TA0E,"*I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive seen many films that claim to pay homage to the classic slasher flicks of the 80s, but few of them do the genre justice.  Many are weak attempts that rehash what weve already seen with little flair or ambition.  But every once in a while, a film comes along that captures the heart and soul of this beloved class.  Such is the case with Anchor Bays recent release, LOST AFTER DARK.  A true labor of love, this film sets the standard for homage films, and I highly recommend this one to anyone who is a fan of good horror.

I have to tell you:  I loved this movie from the start.  It is set in 1984, and it actually feels like it was shot in that year.  This aspect truly impressed me, as many films claim to have an air as such, but they then fall short.  LOST AFTER DARK succeeds where those films fail.

LOST AFTER DARK is shot very well and looks excellent onscreen.  The film-style has a vintage look, complete with grainy images and tiny blemishes on the film itself.  I love this, as it adds to the nostalgia, and it helps give the film a sort of credibility as a slasher.

The acting is top notch, as well.  I did not recognize anybody in the cast, but they all do a great job bringing these high school stereotypes to life.

LOST AFTER DARK feels like THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  It has truckloads of intensity and some great gore, to boot.  Even if the film was set in modern day, it would still be effective as a slasher.  I love this movie, and I highly recommend giving it a shot.  It is available now in a variety of formats.",1442361600,5,1642,4.218649517684887
7316509,4,B010T2TA0E,"This movie is much better than I was expecting it to be. There are a lot of horror/slasher films today that try to be a throwback to the classic 80s slashers, but most fail pretty badly. While this one will never be confused with the classics, it's actually pretty entertaining and packs more than a few surprises along the way. Without giving away anything, I thought it was bold of the filmmakers to go against one of the standard slasher film rules pretty early on in a moment that took me by surprise. The acting is good, and the special effects are practical and not shy with the red stuff. I'm glad I got this one (at Best Buy for $10) and will definitely be keeping it.",1442275200,,676,4.330708661417323
7316510,1,B010T2TA0E,"This movie tried too hard to be a good retro like slasher film or even a good grindhouse type of slasher film.  It has flaws.  Group of students go to a dance and decide to steal a school bus to go party somewhere else.  The bus breaks down and...yeah.  You would think that would be a promising and easy setup to do a great homage slasher film...Nope.  One of the numerous flaws is that the film gives away the killer's identity too early in the film.  And... where are the boobs?!  No nudity in a slasher film?!  Ian Kessner, please go back and watch the successful slasher films and study what made them unique and entertaining.  If you are not going to bring anything new to the table...go balls out over the top to make it entertaining like how Adam Green did with the Hatchet franchise.

7316514,2,B010T2TA0E,"This movie has awesome cover art!

...and that's about it.

While not entirely incompetent, it is nowhere near the 80's homage/throwback it would like you to think it is. It's pretty much in line with any of your standard Anchor Bay/STARZ forgettable, sub-mediocre, straight to DVD fare (like MUCK, for example) with a pedestrian set of weak kills, a barely seen & not terribly interesting killer, and ""characters"" who mostly seem intentionally scripted to be as obnoxious and/or dull as possible (disclosure: as a fat guy myself, I did kind of sympathize with the fat kid that all the chicks think is ""cool"" & ""nice"", but who is perpetually friend-zoned by them in favor of the more athletic dudes) - and that is about all this film has to pass for ""plot development"".

More of a bare-bones copycat of the HATCHET series, which itself was a pretty rote & mindless copycat... and LOST AFTER DARK  doesn't have the luxury of any of the recognizable genre stars, nudity or outrageous gore to fall back on, elements which at least make Victor Crowley's HATCHET exploits worth checking out once. All LOST AFTER DARK can summon is a hammy, wasted, two-dimensional bit part performance by Robert Patrick and a cannibal killer not fit to wash Anthropophagus' underwear.

It's cheap for a reason.",1441756800,2,1288,4.863013698630137

8723124,3,B010T2TA0E,"Lost After Dark is a tale of two halves.  The first half of the film is really bland and focuses on school girls and boys having typical teenage conversations.  They really overuse a scene with the one male classmate jumping out from behind the bushes to scare the girls.  He's either a party animal or a pervert.  He jump scares them on school property and later in the woods when the bus they're traveling on runs out of gas.

The second half is much much better.  It takes SUCH a long time to actually get to the horror and killings.  The killer himself -some oversized bearded man with a hatchet- is part of a legendary family responsible for many murders.  Apparently the cops never found this particular guy.  He's been hiding alone in the woods all this time.

I really wanted to like this movie because Robert Patrick is a terrific actor and I severely miss the Unit.  What a great TV show that was!  I never thought he'd lower his standards to star in a low budget slasher movie but here it is.  His vice principal character seems odd and never quite made sense.  He's a tough guy, he cares about his students and making sure they keep on the right path but... maybe he cares *too* much which is why he often comes across too strict (hence the later scene when he doesn't believe the teens at all when they say a killer is after them and thus gets into a fight with the killer).

But yeah, too much conversational time between all the teen characters with no atmosphere whatsoever REALLY drags this movie down in the first half.  There is a slight twist in that the two characters that appeared like they'd be the survivors (Jesse Camacho, the overweight kid with low confidence who does a lot of drugs and Eve Harlow, the girl who hangs out with Jesse as they mingle about trivial stuff and appear to be on the verge of becoming girlfriend/boyfriend) actually both get murdered viciously.  Instead the one survivor is... I won't spoil it, but it's cliched.  Really didn't make sense why Jesse was the bus driver, and why there was little suspense when the teens stole the bus.

You also have Lanie McAuley who plays the snotty girl.  Her boyfriend is Alexander Calvert's character.  He doesn't treat his women right so the two get into arguments from time to time.  So you have Jesse and Eve, and Lanie and Alexander having conversations/figuring out their relationship issues, when the story SHOULD be heading in the direction of the teens running for their lives in the woods as a killer is on the loose.  Also there's Sarah Fisher's character.  Yeah she's the cutie pie of the group.

The actual killings are pretty good.  The killer has a hatchet and prefers using it as his weapon of choice.  Perhaps the best scene is one that is unintentionally funny.  It's when Robert Patrick confronts the killer and believes his time in the war will enable him to easily whip the killer.  A moment later the front door of the nearby home Sarah's hiding in kicks open and the crazy guy throws Robert's head on the floor!  His head was clearly fake.  I mean there wasn't even an attempt to make it look authentic.  Silly!

On a subtle note, the scene where Eve stumbles in the woods and feels something hit the top of her head is pretty good.  It would have been predictable for either a dead body or the killer himself to jump down, but instead it's Sarah.  She's hiding up there.  Good little surprise, but what are the odds of all the trees in the forest Eve just so happens to stumble under the one Sarah's hiding in?

And a little SPOILER here.  I thought for sure Jesse -who was roped to the side of a barn- would eventually break free and be the sole survivor.  But I was wrong.  It's hard not to laugh as Jesse's hanging on the side of a barn and yet, his friends are unable to help since they fear the hatchet man will jump out of the doorway and attack.  To make matters worse, while running around finding places to hide, the teens go back to normal conversational talk and forget all about helpless Jesse!

If you can tolerate a really average first half you might enjoy this movie, but to be honest I had trouble doing that and my attention was beginning to wander until the murderer finally revealed himself.  So I probably wouldn't recommend Lost After Dark. Oh and about that ending?  Wow!  I've seen some unspectacular ones in horror movies, but this one has gotta be high on the list of lame endings.  It's just too lame to even mention.",1483488000,,4457,4.47394540942928
