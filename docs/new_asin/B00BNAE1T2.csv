5657235,5,B00BNAE1T2,"Thank you very much Shout Factory, It's very good to finally have the option to own the entire 52 episode saga to the 1989 Anime Series of the Adventures Of Mowgli In The Jungle Book.

This is one out of god knows how many rare English Japan Anime Translations that didn't make it to TV commercially in the USA, mainly just Canada & Europe.

It was actually translated into English by a Canadian studio it's self in 1990, one year after it premiered in Japan.

This series is a true classic to cartoon lovers because not only does it have true adult themed none education humor, but every episode is it's own story, with not as such a cliffhanger at the end of every episode, while most episodes have nice friendly happy endings, but also when the next episode starts, the characters are visually where you last saw them in the previous episode like reality of life which is very good top quality.

I've got the 16 DVD set from Czeck Republic in Europe which includes the English Language Version with just 3-4 episodes per volume, so I have already watched the whole series and can tell you it is absolutely fantastic quality.

If it was translated into English by an American studio, it wouldn't have been anywhere near as good, because when it gets down to up to date kids TV in America, they Americanise foreign cartoons too much, rather than sticking to the original foreign humor and simply translating the same stories and language into English, they create their own stories for the animation instead, but Canada and Europe are a lot better at sticking to the original humor and scripts when translating foreign cartoons into English.

Thanks a lot Shout Factory for such a rare release along with all your other top quality rarity releases that fans are very grateful to you about.",1367625600,9,1790,4.64873417721519

5657259,5,B00BNAE1T2,"I discovered this little gem last summer, and loved it (so much that I ended up watching the hole thing in three days).
Other commenters have said that the color is a bit off in some episodes,
it is a bit annoying at times but it is not a deal breaker.
Other than a few messed up bits the artwork is actually quite nice.
The disks are all in one case, but are arranged so that you can take any given disk out and not have to remove other disks to get to it.
Between a great story, good case design, and nice artwork it has earned the five stars I am giving it.",1421020800,,560,3.9210526315789473

5657261,5,B00BNAE1T2,"I have been looking for this series for a long time. So glad it finally made it to a DVD release. I had 3 or 4 of these episodes on a VHS tape as a kid and my brothers and I wore them out watching them. I think this is a great buy for kids, or if you're just feeling nostalgic like me and want something to hang onto to show your own kids some day.",1410048000,,348,3.5921052631578947
5657262,4,B00BNAE1T2,">> For those familiar with this adaptation, wanting to know about the quality of the DVD:

It's no doubt that we owe a lot to Shout! Factory for releasing a box set.  The series is great, but is a bit niche so it was a surprise that we got an English-dubbed release after a little over 2 decades.

However, the quality leaves a lot to be desired.  The DVD claimed that the episodes were mastered ""from the best available video sources"".  I couldn't help but feel a good number of their sources were VHS tapes.  Image quality ranges from alright to bad; it's definitely not the kind of quality you expect from a DVD.  The ""enhancements"" generally involved adding a color filter or adjusting the saturation.  Unfortunately, the result can be disastrous.  In one of the first episodes, there is a scene with fire all over the entire screen.  Because they adjusted the saturation too much, the entire screen became so red it became an eyesore.  The color filter is noticeable in a few episodes.  It's not hard to notice that the screen is somehow extra blue or extra yellow.  I also noticed that the lower part of the screen is usually a bit cutoff, but this is not noticeable unless you play it together with the Japanese version side by side.

As for the overall package, it's pretty standard so no complaints in that regard.  The case comes with a cardboard slipcover.  All 6 discs sit fine inside the case, with no danger of getting accidentally scratched.  The episode titles are listed on the reverse cover.  There are no DVD extras;  just play and chapter select.  There are also no subtitles available.

I own the Japanese DVDs, and the quality simply does NOT compare.  Not even close.  Here's a link to an imgur album of screenshot comparisons ([...] including the fire scenery I discussed.  The left screen is from this US DVD, while the right screen is from the Japanese DVD.  Requests for particular screenshot comparisons are welcome.

>> For those new to this version, but familiar the original story:

Jungle Book: Adventures of Mowgli (orig. ""Shonen Mowgli"") is a Japanese adaptation of Kipling's classic released back in 1989.  Much like the Disney adaptation, the story follows a young boy named Mowgli who wanders into the forest and eventually adopted by wolves.  He faces many challenges along the way, such as the man-eating tiger Shere Khan who wanted to eat him ever since he was a baby.  Mowgli also struggles trying to live like a wolf, and fitting in with the wolf pack.

Admittedly, this is my first exposure to the story, but even as an adult I was enthralled by the unique story.  The story can be deceptive and seem like it's only for children.  Eventually, many mature issues are raised, although they are presented in ways that make it viewable for everyone.

There are many differences compared to the Disney version that also put it closer to the source material.  There is a much bigger focus on Mowgli's relationship with the wolf pack, especially with his family.  Bagheera the black panther is much more of a buddy, while Baloo the bear is more of a teacher.  Kaa the snake is actually friends with Mowgli.  There are many small details from the book that were brought to life in this adaptation.  If you read the book beforehand, you won't be able to help but smile at the nods to the source, although they are found more towards the end.  A lot of the characters missing from the Disney adaptation are here.  A few things were altered.  Some side stories were added, but they meshed rather well that they actually do nothing but improve existing storylines.

The voice acting is generally fine.  Some characters were lovingly brought to life by excellent voice acting, such as Akela, Luri and Chil.  At first, Bagheera's might shock you with his heavy accent, but eventually grows on you.

There's another English DVD collection, but it's subbed and only found in India.  I presume it's very difficult to find since it's a pretty old release.  The German version is easy to find on Amazon Germany (""Das Dschungelbuch Die Serie"") and the quality is quite close to the Japanese version, but I am not sure if it has English subtitles (likely not).  The Japanese version obviously has the best quality, but it has no subtitles whatsoever and is very expensive to import.  There are probably other DVD releases I am not aware of.  Fun tidbit:  the Japanese DVD has one English-dubbed episode, and the quality is miles better than the actual US DVD.

Ultimately, ""Adventures of Mowgli"" is the greatest adaptation of the Kipling's work.  The DVD collection is alright, but it's pretty much the best way to see the series in English.",1388620800,4,4673,4.701234567901235
5657263,5,B00BNAE1T2,"We wanted to go with a non-Disney version and this was great. Both my 6 and 3 year old enjoyed it and although there are some things that were intense (there was hunting and killing), it wasn't gory or overly done for shock value. It was presented in a way that I could say, ""This is what happens out in the wild."" Not any different than watching the Animal Planet in that regard (though I would still censor some things even on AP). I would say just go ahead and buy the video, though. The episodes are too expensive and my kids wanted to watch each and every one.",1377561600,,565,4.192660550458716

8571419,4,B00BNAE1T2,"this may be by far the best thing to ever happen in the jungle book franchise.

the stories and lessons told in this series are much more powerful and enlightening than what you can hope to find in modern juvenile media, although I'm not sure if it is intended in any way to be educational.

I also believe this to be the closest accurate adaptation of the original Jungle Book.

the animation, casting, soundtrack and everything about the show is well executed and is one of those rare true gems.

there are still some things worth mentioning.

for one thing there is often much peril,  sometimes very intense bouts of it to be seen.

the show also occasionally deals with complex and painful issues.

mowgli loses his human parents in the first episode and then his wolf father no sooner after that.

there is much rejection towards the wolf pack adopting a human child,  but he is eventually accepted.

later on he finds out that he is a human however and this is very frightening, confusing and painful to mowgli.

characters also often bicker, one especially for much of the series, even though she eventually changes.

also while most of the animals are mowgli's friends and are harmless looking there are sometimes enemy animals in some episodes that are quite scary looking in their appearance.

animals also often hunt and fight to survive and sensitive kids may not understand or be able to handle this,  sometimes the fighting is intense and there occasionally some blood.

because of the occasionally intense material, including animal violence the series should be best viewed by kids approaching preteen years.

many people will likely not have seen all 52 episodes in the English version.

this complete series in DVD may not be around for too much longer
so get this one while you still can!!!!!!!!!!.

it is significantly better than any of the other Jungle Book stuff.",1520985600,,1886,4.801242236024844

8571421,5,B00BNAE1T2,"This series got international acclaim when it came out and was translated into a number of languages. This series is quite close to the original 'Jungle Books' written by Rudyard Kipling, though it is made into a series of a young lad, Mowgli, growing up, Some details of the books are changed around for the purpose of the series. It shows not only Mowgli growing up, but his wolf brothers, making mistakes and learning from them. He grows into a courageous, resourceful, but loving young lad, learning teamwork but also can be a smart aleck. He has to face and solve a couple identity crises, in the end realizing, with some help from the young girl Jumeera and her family, that he is human and with them he is to dwell.  A number of good reviews of this series are available online. I certainly enjoyed it.",1485475200,,809,4.541095890410959
