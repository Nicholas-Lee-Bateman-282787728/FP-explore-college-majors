4123564,5,B003H23KSM,"This dvd brings to the table the events that have shaped the world in which we live today & really does define THE NEW WORLD ORDER in terms of what can be seen. It has been excellently put together. The historical events layed out have gone on right under the very noses of the majority of the people of the world, past & present because people have been too busy being occupied with themselves to take notice. The masses have been distracted by those bringing about this NEW WORLD ORDER with films, music, sports & any other form of entertainment you can imagine.
IT'S TIME TO WAKE UP & THIS DVD IS A GOOD STARTING POINT!
One more point i would like to add is that there is far more going on than people realise. This NEW WORLD ORDER is not only POLITICAL but it is a RELIGIOUS/POLITICAL ORDER!

4123566,5,B003H23KSM,"Since Jason Bermas now seems to be affiliated with Alex Jones, it would behoove Mr Jones to take a page from his new associate's playbook.  Not to say that this is a better film in terms of technique, editing, etc; only that there's almost nothing extraneous to the main thrust of ""Invisible Empire"" - whereas, in most Alex Jones documentaries, there's so much superfluous data that it's difficult to concentrate on the main theme.  Mr Bermas takes things slowly, building a truly impressive case against those bent on creating and overseeing the by now infamous ""New World Order.""  His method is inductive in that he begins with the general - the widest possible collection of elites having a common interest in this ""New World Order;"" then proceeds to slowly narrow his focus, ending with the specific - the smallest collection of ""New World Order"" elites.  He moves from the League of Nations to the United Nations to the Council on Foreign Relations to the Tri-Lateral Commision and, finally, to his mentor Alex Jones' great bugaboo, the Bilderberg Group - and, in the process, he makes an excellent case for this shadowy Group being not only a great menace to humanity but an almost omnipotent ruling body of most of the world already.  An excellent case - but not an air-tight case.

Bermas' ""Achilles Heel"" is his insistence, a la Alex Jones, that climate change and, particularly, man-made global warming is nothing but a gigantic hoax perpetrated on humanity by the purveyors of the ""New World Order"" so as to establish a world-wide ""Carbon Tax"" as a seemingly rational pretext for world domination.  All he offers as his proof for this bombshell is a couple scientists' admission of having falsified their data to show that global warming was real, plus the vague assertion that there have been far greater concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere at various times in the past and yet life flourished.  Of course it flourished: life will flourish in one form or another under almost any condition; but not human life.

Another thing heavily focused on in Bermas' work, once again a la Alex Jones, is the virtual metamorphosis of America The Free into America The Police State. And he provides ample evidence to back up this contention.  My only reservation with this assessment is simply that, historically, the United States - like every other nation-state that exists or ever did exist - has always been a police state to some extent.  Turn any page from our history and you'll find some or another group - especially minority group - being oppressed by the force of the state or community.  The Rule of Law practically guarantees it.  It's just a matter of degree.  And Bermas, to his credit, makes clear that that ""degree"" is fast approaching 100%.",1284681600,8,2761,4.846808510638298

4123576,5,B003H23KSM,"This was better than most documentaries of this nature. I haven't seen them all, but quite a few. But this covers nearly everything: JFK assassination, 9/11, NAFTA, NSA, CFR, and more. The only dvd that is as good or better in exposing the JFK or Oklahoma City bombing (among many other things) is ""A Great Deception,"" which isn't sold here on Amazon. But what was different as to what was brought out in this that I hadn't seen elsewhere was about the Iran Contra scandal. I found out that under Reagan we were shipping in the drugs all the while they claim they were warring against drugs. This exposes the extreme rightwing hypocrisy like that. Apparently these elitist scumbags can't even get along with themselves as this even pointed out that it was Bush Sr. who was behind the attempted assassination of Reagan. I love that this also brought out about the republican homosexuals, with republican presidents attending Bohemian Grove way back for a long time. Sure, there had been a few democrats, but not as consistent as republicans. This even pointed out Newt Gingrich as attending the Grove. That figures, the ones who are the most self righteous are opposite of their pretensions, the worst of scumbags. I'm reading through many books now about all kinds of scandals and cover-ups of republicans that is just mind boggling, and I'll get to doing those reviews too when I'm able to finish them. Some are really thick books. But this even brought out about the callboy scandals of the Carter, Reagan, and Bush (Jr.) whitehouse. This even revealed Prescott Bush as a supporter of the nazis. This also dealt with bipartisan or neutral issues like exposing the global warming scam. Yes, there is a lot of toxic pollution and destruction of the environment but has nothing to do with the earth warming up. Some of the very ones espousing this, especially among the elitists like Ted Turner, are causing the destruction that they preach against. Same thing with Al Gore. They are all hypocrites who don't set the example but then tell us how to live. This even mentioned the microchip technology and exposed it as causing cancer, yet this is what the elitists want to do with us and could care less about the side effects. Most link this microchip stuff with the mark of the beast, or technology he'll use, but didn't mention that here. While I understand the desire to want to fight this stuff, and I guess we should the best we can while we can, ultimately it is all coming when the antichrist will take over and establish his new world order. This is where Revelation talks about the patience of the saints for what we will have to endure, just like the apostles and the early church. But the judgment will be sweet payback. About the only thing this didn't cover was GMOs, which is dealt with on the American Empire dvd. I highly recommend this dvd as it covers most of what is going on and exposes both sides in this corruption.",1405209600,,2936,4.6698841698841695

4123590,2,B003H23KSM,"I'll start by saying that I'm all about the conspiracies. I know they exist and they're major. So, when I say this documentary was disappointing, it isn't because I'm against the idea. It had a lot of great, essential information in it, but also a lot to be disappointed in.

Bottom line: Despite it's great exposures, the documentary seemed a-little unbalanced and lacked support and evidence for some important assertions. Honestly, I think you're better off buying books on the subject from experts. This documentary is better than nothing, but, if you choose to get it, keep your brain working and watch it critically.

Here are some example of what I didn't like, in order of appearance:

1) this is the most trivial complaint, but it does bug me so I'll mention it. Invisible Empire opens essentially as an infomercial for ""Loose Change"". I guess the way I feel is that if I wanted Loose Change I would've bought it. If Jason impresses me, of course I would seek out his other projects. No need to sell. When I first watched this movie, I was forgiving of this, expecting to find a great documentary. But, after my overall disappointment, I'm now irritated by this unnecessary bragging. Loose Change wasn't even written or directed by Chris - it was written and directed by Dylan Avery. Chris was only one of 3 producers.

2) When he lists people that are involved with the controlling organizations discussed in the documentary, they are immediately given the evil eye as though they are among the root of the evil. But, as much as I like exposing corruption, I don't think EVERYONE that is involved in these organizations are corrupt, not even Oprah (as implied by the video). Most, sure, but not all. The powers that be are immense. It's unfair to assume anyone that's involved is in it for greed. Often, people in powerful positions don't have a choice but to become involved. Alternatively, some good people will go where the evil is, so they can learn what they need to know to help make POSITIVE changes at another place and time.

3) If you watch carefully, the documentary actually contradicts itself. On the one hand, it condemns the New World Order (NWO) as a single group of power hungy individuals set on taking over the world. But then it condems Obama when he says that no single group should be in control of everything. They condemn his comment because the filmmakers seem to view equality among nations as bad?? If Obama thinks no single group should be in control of everything, that certainly applies to the power hungry NWO. So why are the filmmakers upset with his statement? We WANT multiple nations in peace and equality, right? Not the single nation of the NWO. Right??

4) Chris says that global warming is not real but a threat CREATED as a way to gain control. Whether you think global warming is man made or not doesn't matter. Both sides of the debate generally agree that global warming exists. But Chris says it doesn't even exist. Given that it DOES exist, it's reasonable to try and minimize the problems we may encounter from it. In this case, political power is useful - even with the creation of new taxes. Carbon tax is insentive for companies to be responsible, therefore, I don't see a problem with it. This documentary is not the place to take up the battle of global warming, but it tries, and it does not do it well. Chris looses tremendous credibility with me here. Especially when he says that people are calling carbon dioxide ""toxic"". But nobody is saying this. It is only said that carbon dioxide TRAPS HEAT. Glass is not toxic, but it traps heat. That's why they use glass for greenhouses and why CO2 is called a ""greenhouse gas"", not a toxic gas. Where did he get this ""toxic"" bit?

5) Chris says that there is no population problem on our planet. But because some politicians have publicly stated that there IS a population problem, he insists that it's just another thing the government is making up to control us. But our populations ARE too high. Even in the US, and even though it's been declining. It's been an interest of mine that I've researched and can argue about. He has no justification to say there isn't a population problem. It doesn't take much to learn about it. This is another fight he should have left alone because he is wrong. We don't even need to take global warming into account to recognize the need to stablize our populations. And, think about it, the government gains money from MORE people paying taxes, not less. It's, therefore, against their financial interest to minimize the population. Think about it.

I know we all like conspiracies and to see corruption exposed, but let's not get carried away.",1314576000,29,4690,4.683252427184466
4123591,5,B003H23KSM,"This movie is probably the best I have seen on describing who the NWO are and what their real agenda is. This would be the ideal movie to give to your 'average Joe' to help 'wake them up' to the realities of who actually controls and shapes our destiny, the means and methods they employ to do so, and what motivates them. All the material is well documented and backed with lots of evidence in the forms of newspaper articles, TV interviews and video footage. The film really does cover all facets of the globalists agenda, the secret societies and think-tanks they attend to hatch their evil plans and the means they utilize to dumb down the general populace and keep them in the dark as the nightmare slowly and insidiously unfolds.

Even I who already had a fairly extensive knowledge of who the globalists are, which organizations they attend and what their agenda is, learned quite a bit of new material. I was shocked at the pure evil and perversity of these parasitic control freaks and it saddens me and makes me very afraid for what the future holds.

I hope I'm wrong but I really do feel that the general populace are simply too dumbed down and ignorant to prevent the nightmare these wicked monsters (and I'm not exaggerating when I call them that- its probably an understatement) have in store for us from unfolding. As long as the average dope on the street is distracted and absorbed by what celebrities are doing, watching sports and following the progress of their favorite contestant on the latest 'reality show', there really is no hope for us to stop the globalists, arrest them dead in their tracks and hold them accountable for their diabolical crimes against humanity.",1314489600,23,1692,4.693602693602694
