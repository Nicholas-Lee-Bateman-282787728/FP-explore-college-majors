8447308,4,B004MMEEAY,"This documentary covers Dr. Doug DiBianco's class at Eastern Illinois University.  I actually took this course in Fall of 1996 so I HAD to get this.  The documentary itself is well-made and definitely shows Dr DiBianco's personality.  I thought it was hilarious and provided a great synopsis of how close-minded people can be.  Because I took this class, I personally felt that it did a good job but it would have been even better if near the middle or end of the movie to go into a deeper dive explaining how and why the topics that he discussed were critical to understanding how they relate to nonwestern music and give examples...that society sometimes can't handle nor accept certain forms of art and how particular classical composers and artists went through the same thing.  There are many genius compositions and art work that appalled the public at that time because they were bizarre.  As bizarre as Dr DiBianco may be to some, I felt that he made a significant impact on my life and I will never forget him.  He opened my eyes and turned me on to John Waters.",1326240000,,1071,4.634920634920635
8447309,3,B004MMEEAY,The documentary is ok...they really could have made it better by having more discourse on the state of education (public and higher ed) in the country and the phenomenon of producing narrow-minded educators (and students) but instead they just seemed to want to star Doug and his eccentricities.  Got rather redundant after a while despite my wholehearted support of him.,1297900800,,371,5.183333333333334
8447310,5,B004MMEEAY,"This movie offers a true, sometimes controversial, and even tender portrait of a professor willing to push his students by exposing them to new ideas and by often destabilizing their preconceived notions of what art or music ought to be. As an art teacher myself, I find that the role of an educator is to teach their students to keep an open mind on a new subject and to think outside the box. Doug took many risks in his career as a professor, but always in order to show that art reflects its society and often does so by pushing boundaries. I grade it an A+.",1297123200,5,562,4.311320754716981
