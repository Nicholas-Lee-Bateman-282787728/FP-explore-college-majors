5212632,5,B0090SI4LU,"I have just finished seeing the american theatrical release of this movie and boy am I thrilled!

I was very pleased with this great catch of a thriller/monster movie. I have read the other reviews and agree for the most part with most of what they have to say.

However... I believe I got more out of this. As a child I went to the saturday afternoon double features held at the local movie house. Most times they were Godzilla or Japanese monster movies. Also watched a great deal of them on chiller theater. Very few of them got by me, even with the recent releases to DVD and title changes, etc.

What I saw in this movie was homage paid to it's predecessors. Almost all of the earlier movies had a 'family unit' involved with destruction of whatever creature it was. There were moments of fairly stupid humor also scattered among the horrible moments. And political finger pointing always abounded (the strongest was the 'Smog Monster') The special effects at the time were good for a young child's imagination but pale in comparison to today's.

In this movie you get the family unit, a few political statements and the moments of humor. However, this beast is brand new and very scary. No flying turtle or rubber suits here. This guy means business and goes about it in a fast paced, ravenous manner.

It's almost as though Korea is saying... Look, we can make a really frightening monster movie for ya... our first one will be great... and we'll pay homage to all the godzilla-esque type movies just to get the ball rolling.

This creature is done exceptionally well too. It's almost like the Korean Riverside version of 'The Relic'.

I am hoping that this is just the beginning of a long line of films just as good, or even better, to come. It would be nice to see that genre revisited since hollywood is doing a really bad job with all the recent remakes of horror films... seems like these guys got something better going on.",1175212800,,1936,4.561959654178675
5212633,5,B0090SI4LU,"While I agree with what the mentioned reviewer has stated regarding the quality of the film, it should be noted that the reviewer did not understand the political aspect of the film.

While the film does have a few ""Anti-American"" overtones, the real heart of the film lies within the social level of the lower working-class Koreans; mainly how a big event such as a monster attack, and giant political meetings in order to resolve conflicts do not matter to them, as they wish to simply move along with their lives in peace. The ending of the film shows this with many details and symbolism.

As the film is Korean, it would make sense that a Westerner would have some more trouble understanding the underlying commentary, as opposed to an Easterner.",1174089600,3,751,4.7251908396946565
5212634,3,B0090SI4LU,"South Korea's highest grossing film of all time ""The Host"", a new monster film, takes this genre to levels unknown previously with films like ""Godzilla"" and ""The Blob"". It represents a significant advancement in the technology and a lesser advancement in narrative.

Seoul, 2000. An American army doctor (Scott Wilson) orders his assistant, a native South Korean, to dump bottles and bottles of formaldehyde into the drain, a drain running into the Han River, the major river running through the middle of Seoul. The reason? The bottles are covered with a layer of dust and the army doctor really dislikes dust. The assistant protests, but soon relents. Six years later, a food cart operator, Gang-Du (Kang-ho Song) falls asleep every time his dad, Hie-bong (Hie-Bong Byeon) is away from the stand for more than a few minutes. Soon, his daughter, Hyun-Seo (Ah-sung Ko) returns from school and they watch his sister compete in an archery tournament on television. Father and daughter are more like friends; Gang-du even seems to be a bit mentally challenged, like he is at the same level of maturity as his daughter. Then a monster appears in the river and starts to attack the people lounging by the side of the river. Gang-du and Hyun-Seo are chased by the beast and Dad tries valiantly to save his daughter, but the beast soon captures her and drags her away. Nam-Joo (Du-na Bae), the sister, returns from the tournament and they are joined by their brother, Nam-il (Hae-il Park), a young businessman annoyed at the distraction. They receive a call from the daughter's cell phone and try to rescue her, fighting the local authorities, the police, the US Army (?) and ultimately, against the large monster.

Directed by Joon-ho Bong, the rights to ""The Host"" have already been purchased for an American remake, and it is easy to see why. The film's monster elements are well-done, interesting and exciting. But the film suffers from a few uneven performances and some heavy handed political statements which ultimately slow down the proceedings.

From what I understand, the initial event is based on an actual event. The Korean government attempted to prosecute the guilty American, but the US wouldn't hand over the man in question. According to IMDB, he was finally convicted in 2005, but didn't serve a prison term. I always believe that a fantasy, science fiction, horror film, anything that is not normally something we would experience is more believable, has roots in reality. ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is a great recent example of this; the fantasy world was rooted in the very real world of Spain during the last days of the Civil War. These elements of reality help us associate the more fantastical elements of these stories, making us more willing to accept them. While watching the film, I didn't know that something like this actually happened, but I believed it, because it was convincingly done and seemed like something that could happen.

The monster, created by a special effects studio in San Francisco, is a very unusual thing. Part fish, part eel, part guppy and part frog, multiplied by a thousand (the suckers big and looks like a large ""Alien""), the Monster initially appears hanging from underneath a bridge. People notice the thing and, curious, move closer to get a look. Then it drops into the water and swims towards the people. Moments later, attack.

The first time the Monster runs rampant is exciting and fun to watch. The beast moves fast and wreaks havoc on a small leisure area, where people are lounging in the sun next to the river. Naturally, Gang-du and his family will be in the center of the action, they are our entry into this world. The monster chases people back and forth, takes a few, but Gang-du tries to elude the beast, tries to keep his daughter safe.

The monster is fearsome, and dangerous, making it a little scary. Because it is fast, this adds to the suspense. You never know when or where it will pop up. It also appears to be smart and has a voracious appetite, adding to the scariness of the beast. When it grabs Hyun-Seo, the drama increases because Gang-du naturally fears his daughter is dead, then they receive a cryptic phone message indicating she might still be alive. The family bands together and starts to hunt for her. This leads the individual characters on `hero's journeys' of their own, until they have to come together and work together to fight the beast.

As the family comes together, and gets separated, during their battle with the monster, they face various obstacles. Many of these are also presented in a fairly realistic fashion, adding to the heightened level of suspense. Each is tested, some with frightening results.

The film is less successful as a political statement against the involvement of the US Government in this country and in this incident. As soon as the animal runs rampant, it attacks a US Citizen who is vacationing. Then the news is filled with stories of a virus the man contracted through the monster. Soon, the US Army has quarantined people, hunting for others who have come into contact with the beast, closing off entire areas and plans to use a chemical called ""Agent Yellow"", not a very thinly veiled attempt to make a statement against Agent Orange. This is done in a rather sloppy fashion, and not fully integrated into the rest of the story. This brings the rest of the film down. In the big confrontation between the beast and `Agent Yellow', the Army intends to dispense the chemical using a large yellow plastic ball on the end of a crane, which shoots the chemical in a large plume. Hopefully, their targeting system is much more accurate than the contraption looks, it resembles a large tinker toy. Of course, the chemical doesn't have the intended effect and there are many shots of indigenous South Koreans suffering at the hands of the nasty American chemical.

These scenes are really more of a distraction, not necessary and detract from the overall quality of the rest of the film. The monster is a neat, unique creation which is scary, threatening and fun to watch. But when the film gets bogged down with all of the politics, it loses focus.

I didn't really get what Kang-ho Song was trying to do as Gang-du. Initially, we see he is lazy and more interested in cutting corners than helping to make a success out of the family's food van, very antithetical to the South Korean way of life. But when his daughter shows up, I initially thought he was an older, less intelligent brother. He seems to want to have this type of relationship with his daughter, but he really seems more mentally challenged than anything else. This is clearly done to make his actions throughout the rest of the film appear all the more heroic, but his portrayal is initially inconsistent.

During the last act, when the family has to come together again to defeat the creature, the film shifts again, delivering on the premise of the earlier story.

""The Host"" is a good film, which benefits greatly from advanced special effects and suspenseful storytelling, but it suffers from an almost sophomoric attempt to make a political statement, slowing down the pace of the story, and interrupting the flow of horror, suspense and excitement.

I wonder if the American remake will have some sort of reference to terrorists trying to take over the water supply of St. Louis and they inadvertently create this beast who roams through the upper Mississippi river.",1174003200,3,7458,4.830853563038371
5212635,1,B0090SI4LU,"This movie is horrible beyond words. I remember walking out of the theatre teary-eyed and thinking, ""That's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back."" Yes, it was that bad.",1173744000,,181,4.352941176470588
5212636,4,B0090SI4LU,"This is a review of the US release.  ""The Host"" is a very enjoyable monster movie in the tradition of Godzilla.  The plot is simply - due to some chemical dumping, a mutated fish creature begins dining on civilians enjoying an afternoon along the banks of the Han River.  One unfortunate victim is a young girl whose devoted family (dull-witted father, devoted grandfather, alcoholic uncle, and archery expert aunt).  While trying to find and save the girl, the family members become victims of a Gov't conspiracy to hide the origins of the monster.  Unlike many other horror movies where the creature is hidden in the shadows, the monster in ""The Host"" appears very early in the story and in full daylight.  It is one ugly SOB and incredible fast - in the first attack scene I found myself startled and gasped out loud.  Special effects aside, the story has a strong human element - the family's lover and determination to save the girl, and their young girl's own pluckiness - showing exceptional bravery.  Best thing of all, the story has some unexpected turns and does not end with a traditional ""Hollywood"" ending.  The downsides are that the movie is a little long (the middle third could have been trimmed of some slow moving sub-plots), and frankly the US Gov't doesn't come-off too well either (but how many times have Hollywood films shown evil foreign scientists as the source of all evil?).  A humorous side note - many US cartoons are outsourced to Korea for the actual animation work, but ""The Host"" used a San Francisco company for the digital monster.",1173657600,,1567,4.770370370370371
5212637,4,B0090SI4LU,"This movie is directed by an incredibly talented Mr. Bong Junho (He directed a memory of murders, a great serial killer film). I don't want to reveal too much of story for those who will watch this movie. Simply put, it is a monster movie which is well made in many aspects. First of all, they did a quality job with CG in creating a monster which absolutely looks alive and disgusting as hell. Some of the best actors in S. Korea are playing in this film and they surely did a great job to make the movie real. Mr. Bong's style is that he always adds some comical essences to a serious and intense story. In 'The Host', you will be screaming at one time and laughing out loud at the other time. I don't know if this is a great monster movie ever or something. I am not sure and I don't care.  This film is very likable. Ah, this is a story about family who loves each other. Isn't that sweet?",1173571200,,893,4.132183908045977
5212638,4,B0090SI4LU,"It is a monster movie! (""Han River, Family, and... Monster"" is the title.)

5212639,2,B0090SI4LU,"This movie was a means of producing an anti-American military propaganda.  They made a mountain out of a mole hill from a minor incident that happened in 2000.  I personally know about the incident and the people involved.  It is no where close to being accurate.  The results that they are trying to indicate would never be caused by the chemical shown.  The only positive note about this movie is that it shows a vast improvement of Korean film making techniques in the area of special effects.  They truly have advanced in that direction and the only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of one.  Now, if only they could perfect their factual research before going off the wall into the deep end of improbablity.",1173312000,3,711,4.595238095238095

5212977,1,B0090SI4LU,"I saw this in theaters and remember not liking it at all. Recently I got the DVD as a white elephant gift and a friend who likes ""so-bad-it's-good"" movies asked to watch it with me. However, after the second viewing I can say this one is more so-bad-it's-boring. Really boring.

Firstly, there are a lot of motifs that Stephanie Meyer (author of the novel and listed as a producer) absolutely LOVES. There's the brunette teen girl protagonist who is stuck in a love triangle...or rather ""love square"" since she two beings in one body. No one, not even the seasoned actors, give good performances, the film's cinematography and production design are boring, scenes are over written and go on too long, and just everything feels like it was half-assed. It's as if the production company said, ""We'll slap the author of Twilight's name on this thing and our built-in audience of fans will spend their money!""

Bottom line, this film is boring in all aspects. Skip it.",1485129600,,964,4.766467065868263

5213199,4,B0090SI4LU,"My least favorite feature was the physical appearance of the Souls - it appears very little was spent on special affects there (other than the mirrored containers, which were quite nicely done), and this cheapness distracted from the story. The overall ambience and set design were very good relative to the descriptions in the book, and several of the actors did better than journeymen performances  (Melanie, Jeb and the Seeker Lacey  were decently portrayed), but most of the others were a bit wooden. The book has much more about Wanderer's previous lives, which gives a depth the film is simply unable to achieve in two hours, but it's one of the great sci-fi stories - on my Top 20 list going back to the 1950's - and it was fun seeing it come to life in film form. Think this story could possibly have been better converted to film as a one season mini-series. Better than the 5.9 IMDB rating IMO - I'd have rated it a 7.2 on that scale.",1475625600,,944,4.514619883040936

It's just just some silly love triangle though. It's more about human survival and what happens when the one/s you love are taken. I really enjoyed the character development with this and the casting was awesome. I think it was swept under the rug just due to it being written by Stephanie Meyers (trust me- it's not like Twilight at all).

It was actually so insignificant to me that I couldn't remember if I had watched this movie or not a year later...which I had. I rented it through Amazon and I watched it again and then quickly remembered why I never thought about it again after the first time. There's just not a really excited way to verbalize the thoughts of a character or have a 2 way conversation between a character and the voice inside her head. The futuristic concept and functions were okay and the cave was probably the best scenery. I remember thinking about it when I saw they were going to make the movie-""Well, that probably won't be too good, considering most of the movie is a girl having conversations between herself and the alien that has taken over her body."" And even though I REALLY wanted to like it, it just didn't work. They had a better cast than I thought they could achieve, so kudos for that.

5213641,5,B0090SI4LU,"This film caught me by surprise. It's rare to see such a well-done SF film with good ideas where everything else also comes together - plot development, characters and action. The real surprise was to discover at the end that it was by Stephenie Myer (yes, I came to it that blind - apart from it being SF, I had no idea what to expect). Where the Twiglet saga films come across as excercises in Pure Corn, immaculate music videos, exploiting teen crush popularity culture ('I sparkle in the sun'), this film develops Myer's writing into a sophisiticated story.

It's a sign of a good film to have many good characters, and this film does, but Saoirse Ronan stands out in what could be a difficult role to pull off without confusing (essentially playing 2 x characters in one). There are points where there is true humour when the characters in her head are at odds with each other.",1460419200,,882,4.547169811320755

5213686,4,B0090SI4LU,"I bought this movie for my girlfriend because she is a book nerd and has to read the book before she sees the movie so it makes sense. She doesn't always say the book was better. Sometimes she likes the movie better. In this case, she thought they complemented each other. The movie follows the book closely. It has to condense some for time allowed, that why so many movies are cut up in two parts these days. The YA genre is full of paranormal romance. This story was a refreshing spin off the usual formula of teen angst with supernatural/futuristic elements. I have to say, that I watched it too and while I wasn't as engrossed in it as my girlfriend was, it was easy to follow, well-written, and had a strong leading player. I recommend this movie whether you have read the book or not. Adapted from Stephenie Meyer's novel of the same name, the Host is a sci-fi film with a vague premise that asks viewers to imagine our world after an alien invasion. On a grand scale, this film had the potential to ask ""what if?"" questions, especially if you have seen any or all versions of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers. But once you get past the opening act, it won't be long before you realize that at the core, this film is a silly romance for high school co-eds and sorority sisters. Written and directed by Andrew Niccol, the plot is set in the future where a vast majority of the human population are hosts to an alien species called ""Souls"". These are alien entities residing in human bodies but stripping the human hosts of emotions and memories. We don't get to see the initial invasion or the part where I presume NASA decodes an intergalactic message that reads 'we come in peace' just before calling the Whitehouse and stating the cinematically overdone ""We have a problem"". But in keeping with Meyer's tendency for bloodless melodrama, Niccol skips forward and begins the narrative where Earth is virtually pristine  no wars, no famine, no pollution, no disease, no lies and no corruption. As good as this sounds, a tiny band of human resistance exists somewhere in the Utah dessert with no intention of being 'turned'. The Seeker (Diane Kruger), an authoritative alien in human form knows this. So when Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured, surgically induced with an alien parasite and renamed Wanderer, Seeker expects to learn where the surviving bands of humans are hiding. Yet, somehow, Melanie doesn't let go even as Wanderer tries to take control. Inevitably, Melanie and Wanderer become BFFs (best-friends-forever), before leading Seeker to a near-extinct volcano ingenuously improvised for self-sustenance. This is where Melanie's family resides but also much of the film's melodramatic romance, watered down action and huge deficiencies in logic. Just when you start to question how intelligent or powerful the alien race really is, Meyer's signature love triangle takes center stage; only this time you get two love triangles for the price of one! Although unintentionally humorous, this somehow works in Niccol's favor. There is a lot of contradictory cross-talk between Melanie and Wanderer (who is re-christened Wanda) when it comes to ogling hunks at the volcano but this doesn't help the narrative from steadily descending into a lumbering snooze fest. There is a little bit of action involving all manner of chrome gilded vehicles and I suspect this is how Niccol preferred to depict the luminous nature of this particular alien race, but that's about it. If sci-fi action is what you dig, you are best suited for 2013's share of alien invasion movies like Oblivion or Pacific Rim. On the upside, The Host is marginally better than the brazen Twilight franchise and thanks to Niccol and Ronan, Stephanie Meyer's Melanie has more soul (excuse the pun) when compared to Kristen Stewart's Bella Swan. No doubt there. However, there is a lot lacking given the director's panache in depicting the innate values of a human being's individuality and identity in society (think Gattaca and The Truman Show).",1458000000,,4031,4.90190336749634

They kept a good flow to this movie and while faster paced than the book I do feel a lot was left out that if you didn't read the book you would miss in the character development.  I would watch this movie again.,1457481600,,388,4.1466666666666665

5213748,5,B0090SI4LU,Very good show I had read the book & surprised my oldest daughter who is an avid geek with this movie.. She loved it so much she cried then loved it even more! Since I got a dislike for my review of this show I will go on to add more even tho I hate spoilers on movies.  But the characters in this show really make you care about the main character/ & her inner voice & you grow to love them both to the extent that by the end you are just as torn about the consequences of if she stays in the body or sacrifices herself to give her host freedom.  It is a love story & a triangle with a very unusual twist.,1455062400,,606,3.8015873015873014

5213895,4,B0090SI4LU,"First of al this is a very fine young cast. Second, I have never read the book so I'm going at this as a complete novice. Jake Abel and Max irons are the male leads and do a terrific job as does the female lead of Saoirse Ronan. They were all very believable and seemed very competent in the parts. We have been invaded by small life forms that are not quite symbiotic more of virus that takes over its host form and thoughts so that the host no longer exists. Saoirse gets an alien put in her called the Wanderer and they strike up a relationship and they are both in control. There are the ""bad"" aliens who have constructed a society that is quiet and there are of course hunters to collect what humans aren't part of the whole. I did enjoy it but be warned some spots are veeeerrrryyyy slow. I loved the resolution for a change. Definitely worth a look see.",1452124800,,860,4.218181818181818

If you are looking for the book in movie form, you will be disappointed.  However, I still think they did a good job getting the feel and story onto the screen.",1451779200,,451,4.333333333333333

I knew nothing about the book, nor that the screenplay was written by the same person who wrote twilight (had i known that i wouldn't have watched it). but my kids wanted to see this so i sat through every last single painful minute. i can see how it MIGHT have been a better book, but the decision to have melanie in ""wanda's"" head was a bad one. it is terrible, awkward, cheesy, and worst of all inconsistent. the acting isn't bad, just completely wasted. i can't even find an interesting angle or theme to explore in this story. goodie becomes baddie? baddie becomes goodie? i don't know. this film is all over the place. the sets are rubbish too, even the chrome cars suck. and then there is this crazy twist and sacrifice at the end that's meant to be poignant (complete with hilariously overt sperm into egg symbolism)... what?? i will never get these two hours back. :(",1448582400,,1120,4.436893203883495

5213940,1,B0090SI4LU,"Save your money and read the book.  The movie is not good.  I mean, its not a horrible movie, not in the way you would think I mean by giving it a one-star rating.  I hated it not because of the acting, the characters, nor the plot.  All are service-able.  Its just NOT a story you can tell on screen in real life.  The Host is the perfect example of a book that should just STAY a book.  It does not translate well.  The concepts that are explored in the book lose alot in the translation.  I mean, you have one character falling in love with a foreign consciousness that is living in a human body...and not the body or the native person that is STILL living in there as well.  No actor or actress in the world could portray this.  Its just impossible...I mean, it was even a little weird in the book.  Italics usage is for thoughts, flashbacks or emphasis on a single word.  But for the book it was kinda hard because, you had two separate thoughts (living in the same body) that had to be voiced.  At times it was difficult to tell which italics were for what entity/person.",1447286400,,1077,4.241379310344827

5214099,4,B0090SI4LU,"I really like this movie.
The critics hated it, and in some ways I can see their point.  It took a really interesting young adult style science fiction book and turned it into a ""romance"" type movie with a great actress but only so-so directing.  Much of the cast seemed mis-cast.
I think Saoirse Ronan rose well above the script (and directing) to really shine.  Her portrayal of a character who has fallen into an impossible trap (alien host occupying her mind) is well done.  The alien, in many ways, seems more human throughout the movie than the girl who is possessed. Some have criticized the movie for turning the human personality into a ""brat"" or ""whiner"". I guess they miss the point that anyone who has their mind and body yanked out from under them will undoubtedly be less-than-pleasant to their occupying entity.....
The special effects are spotty - the ""eyes"" are amazing - I don't know how they achieved the ring-in-the-eye effect, but it is at times sinister and at times just fades into the background.
It's an interesting movie, great for an afternoon or evening of diversion, and as usual Ms. Ronan is stellar.",1442707200,,1130,4.720812182741117

5214375,3,B0090SI4LU,"The Host
 This seems like a Science Fiction flick about aliens who come to Earth and occupy the bodies of the Earthlings.  The story begins some time after the infestation is nearly universal-we are interested in a few still free humans.  If you are thinking of some version of The Body Snatchers think again.  This is a story about teen love from the perspective of a lovely young lady, albeit with complications involving alien possession and two girl personalities inhabiting the same body.
 Saoirse Ronan is the young girl.  She and her little brother escape the infestation long enough for her to find a suitable free male and fall in love.  She is ultimately captured by the aliens and a thousand year old alien in inserted into her body but establishes incomplete dominance.  The struggling duel personalities find the boy friend with a survivor group in the wastes of New Mexico.  What follows is a long contest between the pair.  One girl still loves the boy friend, the thousand year old alien falls for another guy survivor with tangled emotions and anger running high on all sides.  Ronan is a great actress who made a big success with The Lovely Bones.  She is better than the material, as is William Hurt who has a supporting role.  Diane Kruger also has a supporting role as the alien inhabited Seeker who hunts the surviving humans.
 Inside the body of the teenage girl two impulses are at war, one evil and bitchy and the other rational and loving.  Why they needed the whole alien thing to make the point is beyond me.
 Writer /Director Andrew Niccol gives us a perfectly good PG-13 film directed at the same demographic that made the Twilight films so very popular.  On that basis we can enjoy The Host.  Niccol also both wrote and directed the well done In Time in 2011 and the also good Lord of War in 2005.  I liked both of them quite a bit.  The Host is a bit off my pallet but I cant fault it as a well crafted teen romance at the upper end of such fare.  As Science Fiction it leaves a lot to be desired (like ray guns, burning star ships, shattered cities and what not.)
 This complicated teen romance has a budget of $40 million and the three day gross came to Eleven million dollars.  It runs a good two hours and five minutes.  As a well done teen romance I give it a solid if not spectacular three saw blades.  As Science Fiction, a single Exploding Nova.",1433721600,,2385,4.477958236658933

It's understandable because the book is pretty long so there were a lot of things that had to be cut out. As always, the book was better. I would mostly recommend this movie to those who read the book, not so much to those who hadn't.

5214733,4,B0090SI4LU,"Director Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, In Time) is known for taking ideas presented in short stories and turning them into something magical for the big screen. The Host is loosely based on Robert Silverberg's classic, Passengers, and tells the story of aliens who come to earth and use human beings as host bodies. Once inside, the aliens replace their humans consciousness for their own purposes, but some are able to resist this process and even control their alien host. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is one of those people, and while she can't rid herself of the alien presents inside of her, she can control it. Saoirse Ronan stars and it is great to finally see her in a movie that is worth while. Ronan is one of the top young actresses in Hollywood, but she keep playing roles like Hanna, in terrible films that do little more than to allow her to show off her talent. In those films, she was the only thing worth watching, so putting her in a film that's actually good, really gave her the opportunity to shine and she was amazing. Ronan played the role of Melanie, trapped in her own body but also played the alien Wanda that was inside of her. Once gaining control of Wanda, Melanie seeks out her family, which are part of the resistance. He main love interest is played by Max Irons, who was also terrific. Known more as a model and background character, this was really one of his first starring roles, and he was fantastic, playing a man caught between his love for this girl and his hatred for the alien inhabiting her. The Host has it all, an alien race, chasing a fugitive on the run, leading up to a major dilemma, wrapped inside a love story. Silverberg's Passenger is a favorite of mine and I knew with Andrew Niccol at the helm that this was going to be a good film, but I had no idea how innovative and intense the story would be, and for that, The Host is the latest film to join our list of must see movies.",1420934400,,1928,4.433802816901409

5214735,5,B0090SI4LU,"The Host is one of my favorite sci-fi films of the past several years.  I expected it to be maybe a little creepy and a little cool but I was pleasantly surprised and moved by this beautiful story.

Saoirse Ronan really hits it out of the park as the main character (well actually, ""characters"" :-) in this film.  What an amazing, mature actress for her age.

The caveat is, it didn't do super well in the movie theaters and thus a good number of people didn't like it as much as I did.  I happen to like this particular director's directing style, for one.  I also liked the spiritual aspect of this story that leans in the direction of the idea of the soul itself not BEING a body but operating one.

This same director (Andrew Niccol) directed 2 Other (very different) films that I also loved: ""Gattaca"" which is a futuristic story dealing with cloning, DNA manipulation, etc. and ""In Time,"" possibly my favorite sci-fi film (other than Guardians of the Galaxy directed by James Gunn) over the past 10 years!!  In Time deals with an alternate reality where the time left on one's body clock is used instead of currency.

There is a sense of style that really speaks to me that Mr. Niccol conveyed In both The Host and In Time as well as to some degree, Gattaca.  Very smooth, purposeful and sexy.  That's the best way I could describe his style of directing :-)

Not everyone will love The Host But anyone who likes it a bit may end up loving it a lot by the end.

I'll close this review by saying, the music is absolutely amazing and the piece ""Soul Outside"" is one of my favorite pieces of music ever (was happy to find that I could buy it on iTunes ... and I suppose it may be available on Amazon(?)  since I'm leaving this review on Amazon I definitely need to include that :-)",1420416000,,1784,4.350453172205438

5214785,4,B0090SI4LU,"I found this SF/romance movie surprisingly good and interesting, not a masterpiece, but a very honest thing indeed. It came as a surprise, as I didn't like the book AT ALL. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

Earth, near future. Our world have been conquered by very advanced alien race, who call themselves Souls. Those invaders are small parasites, unable to survive for extended periods of time outside the bodies of their hosts (if removed they must be quickly placed in special survival containers - or die). With the time they evolved in such a way, that their hosts must be sapient creatures themselves (at least, if I correctly understood this).

Having acquired the technology of starflight they started to expand, conquering more and more worlds - Earth is just their last prize. However, on our planet they meet for the first time an unexpected challenge, as some hosts minds remain alive and active even after Souls invaded and took control of their bodies. This creates a very uncomfortable situation, for both the host mind and the Soul...

This film tells the story and tribulations of one such unhappy ""couple"" - a young human girl, Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) and an ancient, experienced Soul known as ""Wanderer"". All this covers like the first 5 minutes of the film and I will say no more about the rest.

Before reviewing the film, I must state here loud and clear that I read and HATED the book, as it was much, much too long (656 frigging pages!) with definitely not enough story to justify its length. Not only it was long winded and boring but it was also rather poorly written - which is a surprise as the ""Twilight"" books were actually rather good and I liked them (yes, I am THE ONE heterosexual grown up married man on the whole planet who liked both ""Twilight"" books and movies). I managed to finish this 656 pages long tedious brick but it was really an ordeal...

The film is MUCH BETTER. The book was long winded - the film is, quite obviously, much shorter. The book made unending spirals, circles and other (not always Euclidean) figures around every development - the film action is quite to the point. The story in the book took every possible and imaginable detour and bifurcation and also drove into every possible pothole - in the film it was smoothed and streamlined, for the greatest benefit of the viewer. In fact the scenarist removed all the blah, when preserving all the main story intact - and that did to this film a lot of good. Kudos to Andrew Niccol for the scenario.

Actors were selected VERY well! Saoirse Ronan was an excellent choice for the main role and she completely ACED it. I saw this young Irish actress in ""City of Ember"", ""The way back"" and ""Byzantium"" and she always impressed me. Her character, exactly as Bella in ""Twilight"", is a deceptively average gal who finds herself the object of attention of... well, more than one rather not average young gentlemen... And exactly as with Bella in ""Twilight"" we come ultimately to realise that she is definitely NOT average - AT ALL! It takes a special kind of beauty to play such a character and indeed, nobody would ever mistake Saoirse Ronan for a Victoria's Secret mannequin. However the power of her ""smart+talented=sexy"" appeal is such that she can easily outstage most of Hollywood lookers - and match the others...

Max Irons (already good in ""Red Riding Hood"") and Jake Abel (whom I never saw in anything before) play respectively Jared and Ian, who are the Edward/Jacob team (sorry, I couldn't resist) of this film. They also do a good job, but their roles are ultimately not so hard...

William Hurt is absolutely excellent in his role of wise, aged, shotgun carrying uncle Jebediah Stryder who is the benevolent, reasonable, paternalistic, pretty deadly and quite scary ancestor ruling an underground (in all possible meanings of this term) kingdom...

Diane Kruger (""Ich bin Helen von Droy, und I vound Vreemazons Dreazure, ja?"") shines absolutely (in every possible meaning of this term) as a high ranking officer of special police of Souls, the Seekers. Known simply as The Seeker (although I couldn't stop thinking of her as ""Ve Zeeker, ja?"") she quickly develops a special interest in The Wanderer/Melanie Stryder case - and she actually has her own very good reasons for that... In the book, the body The Seeker occupied was a petite brunette, here quite obviously the director made the choice of a whole different enchilada - and it did this film a lot of good, especially considering that Seekers for some reason wear always immaculately white, top fashion clothes...

Emily Browning appears briefly towards the end (I am not saying anything about her character) bringing to this film her talent and her unique, unconventional kind of beauty. Kudos to Andrew Niccol for the choice of actors and wardrobe.

The film is well made, with relatively few obvious plot holes which appear mostly in the one, short action scene. The stupidity of this scene resides in long, persistent shooting against a target that is OBVIOUSLY bullet proof, to the point of running out of bullets when a softer hostile target appears... But this scene is ultimately not so important and can be easily disregarded. The rest of the story actually more or less makes sense, it is skilfully narrated and illustrated and contains also a couple of very quotable lines (""kiss me like you wanna to get slapped!""). Kudos to Andrew Niccol for directing.

Bottom line this is a good, very honest SF film combined, like in ""Twilight"", with an obviously unusual interspecies romance. It's just that here, unlike the ""Twilight"" triangle (""should I go for dead guy groove or doggy style?"") we have a slightly more complex figure... To my surprise, I liked it and I spend a good moment watching it. Recommended to all SF amateurs and all those who like somehow unusual romances... ENJOY!",1418947200,,5903,4.822134387351778
5214786,3,B0090SI4LU,"I love this author and the movie had a good story, but it I felt like I was watching this with my finger on the fast forward button. It jumped though scenes and there was so many missing pieces.  What I loved was the acting and main character, what I loved was this sci'fi love story.
I would love to see what was on the editing floor for I think they killed this great movie by leaving out so many scenes.  I saw the twilight movies and they had a much better flow, even just the first on, then this did.

They really changed, or better said left so much out from the book the added so much depth. for instance, Wanderer (or Wanda) was actually a teacher in the book, when she got to the caves she was there a month tortured in a way, everyone really feared her  and she spent that time hiding in her prison.  When Jeb walked her around people steered clear of her, all wanting her dead till Jeb slowly put her to work.  And encouraged her to teach others her history and her ways, then she had some that trusted her.
There was no stupid car chases!  That waisted time to much time and funds, totally unnecessary!  It would have been better to show her teaching and telling her stories (the stories in the book were fascinating and captivated the people in the cave) and watching others relax and draw closer to her.
Then you could understand how people loved her as Wanda, and not just the body she was in (aka Melanie). I could not and neither could my roomette understand the flow of the romance in this film,  (My roommate never read the book and I did and to both of us, it made no sense.)  They really left out the character development!!!!  Auughh!

Oh stephanie, how could you let them do this??..  This film could have been/ should have been at least 15 minutes longer, then it would have been a classic.  Why did you let them put in stupid car chase scenes instead of focusing on character development.  Your book nailed it, the move did not. Who was in charge of designing this movie scrip?  Don't you know that without proper character development the movies flop. .......this could have been so much better.",1418860800,2,2121,4.345177664974619

It's the subtle growth of love and learning rather than the intense and fast love that seems to be so popular.

5215107,5,B0090SI4LU,"Last year, I got the movie and book for Warm Bodies, and planned to do the same for The Host, both being movie-book adaptations. Well I got the book but somehow missed out on being able to get the movie. Fast forward a year, and I saw The Host on Netflix. I decided to watch it there. When the movie first started out, the protagonist, Melanie, was really annoying. I was ready to write her off as being just as annoying and useless as Bella. I was almost glad I had missed out on getting the movie. I was tempted to just quit and watch something else, but I have OCD and didn't want to leave a movie half finished in my watched list. So I trudged through. By the time the movie had reached an hour in though I had become fully invested in the characters and my previous annoyances were gone. In fact, the developing bond between Melanie and her invader, combined with the struggle for acceptance and trust by the rest of the resistance really made me sympathetic for everyone involved.

The romance aspect was well done too, and with deep psychological and moral values at play, this was indeed a true romance movie, not a chick flick. If you wish to look for it, there are some deep issues this movie poses. If you're not a philosopher type and just want to kill time watching a romance with your significant other (or alone), the movie can be watched that way too. Either way, the casting and acting was very well done, the CGI could have been better for a sci-fi, but its not weak enough to detract from the experience, and the ending is very well set up to allow the movie to just end here, or, if Stephanie Meyer continues the trend that most authors do, set up for a sequel.

Of course if you don't enjoy romance movies, or are looking for a sci-fi with a bit more...fighting, then it would be wise to steer clear of this one.",1405987200,21,1833,4.310144927536232

5215240,3,B0090SI4LU,"First things first. The Host is not an action movie. It is a sci-fi romance about two boys and one girl, and the girl is torn between the two boys. Based on a Stephenie Meyer novel of the same name, The Host not surprisingly looks a bit like the Twilight saga. The difference is that, well, the heroine Melanie (played Saoirse Ronan, Atonement) is not just a girl, but a girl implanted with a parasitic alien. And the aliens name is Wanda.

Set in the world where most humans are taken over by small aliens named Souls, The Host follows the romance of our heroine Melanie Stryder, a human who persuades her Soul controlling her body (named Wanderer, then Wanda) to run away from the aliens institute to go back to where Melanie came. Melanie/Wanda is pursued by The Seeker (Diane Kruger), dead serious leader of the team hunting down the remaining humans.

Though panned by critics, The Host is not really that bad. Yes, the story lacks dramatic tension with two male characters hardly distinguishable from each other. The Seeker keeps seeking but her motive is not convincing. But visuals are interesting and at least Saoirse Ronan shows what a talented player like her can do, even though her voiceover sounds strange.

Finally, The Host is directed by Andrew Niccol, director of intelligent sci-fi drama Gattaca and writer of The Truman Show (for which he was Oscar nominated). He has directed three films since then  S1m0ne, Lord of War and In Time  all of which have great ideas, but none of them knows how to develop them, just like The Host, his latest film that starts out well but fails to live up to its promise.",1404000000,3,1622,4.637630662020906

When I read this book years ago, I remember thinking, What a great movie this would make! And it did make a great movie. Sadly, much is left out of the movie, due to time constraints.

The male leads are the traditional pretty boys of that genre and they do a lot of kissing of teen girl, Ronan. Also there is much angst and emotional misunderstanding amongst the cute ones. (Oy!) But... there is an interesting science fiction story here, that really caught my attention. Earth has been successfully invaded by parasitic aliens who can take over a human's body and live their life as if they were human beings, except they are nonviolent. There are few uninfected people left and they must live by their wits to escape the fate of most of mankind. What I found interesting was that the story was told from the viewpoint of a recently arrived alien being named Wanderer... eventually nick named Wanda by the wild humans who capture her and her host. Her experiences with uninfected humans turns her (borrowed) head around in a way that causes her to rethink her specie's parasitic lifestyle, and brings her to a courageous decision at the end.

If Stephanie Meyer reads this, I'd ask that you consider writing any possible sequels for adults, if that is at all possible. There's a good story here, if it could only be separated from teenaged angst.",1395705600,,1310,4.745614035087719

Many important points were not included.  In some respects the approach was entirely different - for no apparent reason and certainly without gain. One example is the Seeker, who was portrayed in the book as a truly annoying short brunette always dressed in black from head to toe - but was portrayed in the movie as an attractive tall blond, always dressed in white & not particularly annoying.  At the beginning of the book, even the Healer who attended to Wanderer's awakening was annoyed with the Seeker for good reason, which set the stage for so much more to come. But none of this was included in the movie. Likewise, missing character development made it iimpossible for viewers to connect with or care about the main characters (Wanda/Melanie) to the extent cultivated in the book.  It is unclear why so many things that would not have been technically challenging, were aletered or left out.  It could have been great - but instead it was very disappointing.",1394582400,,1131,4.804123711340206

First, the seeker who hounds Wanderer always wears black and it frustrating with a voice that wears on your nerves like fingernails on a blackboard.  So, when I saw the commercial where the woman was all in ""white"" blonde and beautiful then I knew she was not going to fit the part.  Second, I saw Jared hanging out the window of the van with a gun I thought ""good grief"".  Why do they have to ruin the movie this way.  It's better the way it worked in the book of trying to ""talk"" their way out of the situation.

5215608,5,B0090SI4LU,"This was a well done sci-fi movie with a small but great cast. The story was very well written. It's basically about an alien race that takes over most of the humans on earth. The aliens control the humans once they have been surgically implanted in the humans. For most of the humans who have been taken over by the aliens, the aliens will overpowers and eliminates most of the humans will. A select few humans are still alive and fighting back by sheer force of their will.
The primary character Melanie played very well by actress Saoirse Ronan, has a very strong will to survive and the love she has for her family keeps her fighting despite having to play host in her mind and body to an alien. What's interesting though is that Melanie and the alien character inside her (Wanda) begin to develop empathy and develop a friendship with one another. Wanda also begins to develop a friendship with Melanie's family, friends and the other small group of survivors who have managed not to be taken by the aliens known as the seekers.
This movie is based on a book by Stephenie Meyer the creator of the Twilight Saga. I wasn't interested in the Twilight Saga because it seemed to be specifically marketed strictly for the teen market. After seeing how well The Host was written as a script, how it was well developed, acted and I even really enjoyed the music from the soundtrack in this movie, I am more curious about the Twilight Saga now.
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The Host and Oblivion were two of the best movies that I had seen in awhile. I liked them both so much that I bought both of them to add to my collection,

I like the actress that played Wanda quite a bit.  She just always seemed so pristine even when dying in the desert.  Even the ending was glossy in the movie but the book gives that suspense of the lonely desert night.....I am getting ready to watch it again so that should say something.  I also liked that while there was something of a love triangle it was not the end all of the show.",1391904000,,834,4.130434782608695

It was absolutely horrible! Terrible acting, the actors did not match their characters at all, the settings were almost all wrong, etc. I would say the movie was only about 15% correct in comparison to the book.

5215695,3,B0090SI4LU,"For good reason, this movie was widely panned by critics. The science fiction plot line of the movie touches on familiar ground with aliens not only invading Earth but within human minds. Stephenie Meyer added her own spin by claiming the invaders are actually a peaceful entity, an interesting angle to explore. However, it is not explored because, unfortunately, the science fiction portion of this film serves only as a bland backdrop to the even more under-developed love quadriangle, which in itself is an interesting concept.

Many reviewers cite the actors themselves for their poor performances. I disagree; I think it is entirely the fault of the writing and to an extent the directing. Saoirse Ronan was the main reason I wanted to watch the movie since I am not a Twilight or Stephenie Meyer fan and have not technically read any of her books. Ronan does a decent job with what shes given; at one point, she had me tearing up, a testament to her skill as an actress. The two male leads were terribly under-used; its difficult to tell whether they are good actors or not because the script is so weak and requires very little of either except a kissable face. Diane Kruger also does as good a job as she can, but sadly her character arc is not delved into as much as it should have been.

I blame Meyer almost entirely for the movies critical failure. As the author of the original source material and a producer of the film, she should have ensured against some of the film's most basic mistakes: gaping holes in plot, logic, and character. I have a copy of the book, which I obtained to seek out answers to the science fiction bit and when one character asks how the cryotanks (which carry the alien Souls between planets) work, Wandas answer is literally this: I knew when I was a Spider. But I don't understand it now, creating a convenient excuse to not explain just one small detail about this other culture. That is lazy, weak writing, and I cant believe anyone would make a movie out of this book had Twilight not been such a crazy, inexplicable phenomena.

For me, the movies saving grace is Ronan, the cinematography, location, and mostly the music, the latter of which I cannot praise high enough. The score is absolutely gorgeous and has no business being in this baffling movie. Its as if the soundtrack and Ronan were plucked out of a different story entirely. I think all the elements for a good movie were present. But somewhere along the way (possibly when they decided to let Meyer be a producer), critical details got mixed up or left out. I did not enjoy the love quadriangle; however, I was more satisfied with Wanda/Ian than Melanie/Jared, mostly because I feel that more time and effort were spent on the former. But both relationships were undermined by conflicting ideals. I would recommend not buying this movie, unless you can get it super cheap, because its not really the type of film you'll want to re-watch from beginning to end.",1391299200,2,2970,4.66412213740458

5215783,3,B0090SI4LU,"The movie would have been better if the characters of Jamie, Ian and Jared had been given more depth; possibly even Wanda/Melanie. I felt that you didn't get to know any of them enough to really ""feel"" anything for them. Then again, I'm a female so maybe I just need more depth, period. My husband found the movie very confusing, so I had to fill in the gaps for him since I had read the book previously.

I just never ""felt"" anything for the characters to actually care about the outcome of Wanda's character. Melanie also didn't seem to care too much about Wanda until the absolute last minute, which probably helped me not ""feel"" anything in particular about the direction this movie would take at the end.

I actually watched it three times total before I would allow myself to rate it at all, knowing I was biased because I read the book. I still feel the same. Not enough character development. I wanted to blame it on the actors at first, but over time I came to realize it was simply the script being cut so short that those particular characters were never able to portray themselves fully. The only characters who revealed themselves without fail were Maggie and Jeb, in my opinion.

If I hadn't read the book I would have watched it once and dismissed it completely as a waste of our precious child-free adult time. I feel sorry for the actors because I've seen some other work from them that was much better, and if they'd had more time to develop their characters on-screen, this could have been some of their best work.",1390348800,,1533,4.5071942446043165

Even the movie kept moving from blurry to clear to blurry which made you think that you are watching a VHS converted to DVD converted back to VHS then converted to reel to reel back to VHS. So Weird!

It doesn't take you by surprise, but there's really no means of getting there.

[SPOILER ALERT] - I didn't know it'd be about aliens taking over the subconscious of humans,and taking over their souls (mind,will,and emotion). It was weird.

5216246,2,B0090SI4LU,"Story felt rushed, some crucial character backstory is missing, and the acting is questionable. Bottom line is this is a don't buy.",1385596800,,131,5.0
5216247,3,B0090SI4LU,"I streamed this last night, and enjoyed it.  It's got a good sci fi premise with some good performances.  I hadn't heard of the book, and had no idea this was a Meyer story until I saw her name in the credits at the end.

Pros:
1. It's got some good performances.  Ronan especially is completely convincing as the alien, Wanderer.  While there probably should have been more set up for her alter-ego Melanie, there was a strong contrast between the two, even if Mel came of as a bit petulant.  Hurt also anchors the film as the down to earth uncle.  And Kruger is intense as the seeker, and her arc is actually as interesting as Ronan's.

2. It's got a good premise.  I liked the slow burn and thought provoking questions: What makes us human? How would I react if I was occupied by another intelligence?

3. There were no explosions.  I was glad to watch a sci fi film that focused much more on philosophical questions than action.  While there is some action, it's in context and adds to the story.  The Aliens are non-violent, but one of them becomes violent at one point, and it adds to the greater narrative and themes.

Conflicted:
1. World building was hit or miss.  There was a mix of futuristic sci fi and modern day.  I couldn't really figure out if this took place in the current day or 100 years from now and that took me out of the story.  And no, you don't say ""Look the survivors have all current-day stuff, because they're survivors""  If you're going to do that, you need to make the old stuff really, really old.  It all looked brand new.  As did the survivors.  You don't need to look as haggard as the survivors in The Road, but you need more than the freshly-washed-showered-and-pressed look that the survivors had in this movie.  That being said, I like the alien urban environment and tech.  It fit their philosophy well.

Cons:
1. How on Earth did they manage to spend $40M making this movie?  It looks made for TV in all ways: shot on digital video, cheap sets, cheap effects, etc. etc.  A typical episode of Firefly looks better than this, and those were made for well under $1M per epi.

2. The romantic triangle fell completely flat in all ways.  It wasn't believable.  People just don't act that way.  I won't go into specifics here due to spoilers, but I'm willing to discuss in comments if anyone disagrees.

3. I didn't really like the survivor's camp.  That location, while I appreciated the vistas, is probably the worst one you can think of to hide in.  They would have so easily been discovered and captured with that amount of visibility.  I would have much preferred Twilight's location of the Pacific NW.  It's much easier to hide in the mountains and the forest, and it would have added a grittier contrast to the alien urban environments.  Also, there's no way in Hell you'd have running water in that location.  Sorry.

4. I would have preferred a more realistic portrayal of Survivor life.  They were so blase about security (that they were surprised by the alien patrols is ridiculous given their location), and blase about acquiring supplies.  They should have been acting much more alert and sneakier.  And the power dynamics in the camp were also poorly done.

If you think you can overlook the downsides, I'd recommend this to sci fi fans.  Even with its flaws it's much more thought provoking than much recent sci fi fare such as Transformers, Elysium, After Earth, Into Darkness, and such.",1385510400,,3438,4.55810147299509
5216248,5,B0090SI4LU,"""The Host,"" the original story, was written by Twilight writer Stephenie Meyer, but clearly, this is science fiction and is meant to be far more complicated, and thus, of course it has a better and stronger story.

The fact that celestial beings have taken hold of human bodies on an extreme level, where everyone just leaves in peace, is not the main focus of the film, and that is a good thing. If we want to watch ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" or ""Stepford Wives,"" we will.

No, instead, this movie is about the idea that these celestial beings are not without feeling entirely, and that the main character's personality and thoughts still remains inside the ""Wanderer"" aka ""Wanda,"" so much she likes the same guy, and she begins to see what it means to be human.

Even this story's main antagonist, The Seeker, played by Diane Kruger, clearly has anger issues, given that Wanda is obviously not that important to get a good deal of others killed. She is clearly just pissed off throughout the film, acting like she is complete control but opens fire on her own men just to get to Wanda.

The inner talking of the personality by Saisore Ronan, who is Melanie Stryder, the original person whom ""Wanda"" is inhabiting, is excellent and well-done, sometimes hysterical and sometimes with deep meaning. It makes this film feel very different from pretty much any other.

If you like sci-fi at all, you should give this one a watch. People who liked the book have been overly critical that not every time happened the same, and others have dismissed it as being something ""else horrible"" from writer Stephenie Meyer. The later is beyond unfair bias.

William Hurt's face says it best... hidden under his beard you will see the pained expression he wears every time he has to deliver another mediocre line... and there are many.

As a science fiction film, the special effects are kept to a minimum, but are very effective.

Here are some happy after thoughts for me. 1. Stephanie Meyers.  Didn't know who she was until I started looking for the book to read after I watched The Host. Now I know she's a well talented love story artist. 2. Max Irons. Yeah, Jeremy's boy... also think King Edward of The White Queen... I'd say we have another ""Irons"" to notice when weighing our entertainment choices.  3. William Hurt turns in another impressive performance that makes some spots in the movie that might have been awkward run rather smoothly. 4. After some time thinking about this movie, I believe Saoirse Ronan did an admirable job with a very difficult character to play. And 5. An actual character growth and change driven science fiction plot. If we had more of those type science fiction movies, science fiction would not be relegated to SyFy Channel's struggle for mediocrity.

This movie jumps to the end of the worn out Body Snatcher plot to begin its story. Then it develops... characters meet challenges that change them, for better or worse. If you need a boom and a bang followed by million dollar CGI to hold your attention you might want to skip this one.  If you want to feel something and be entertained, even a heart string pulled here or there, this just may be one of your favorites.

5216730,2,B0090SI4LU,"Glad I did because I'll never watch again. It's cold and harsh and the interplay between Wanda and Melanie falls flat. They also changed everything, even minor details!! Tiny spoiler alert....... for example..... Melanie's dad commits suicide rather than give the kids up but that isn't true in the book and it doesn't improve the story by changing it. When you change things between a book and a movie you should be able to validate those changes. They need to help the viewer form an attachment to the characters or something. (Think the mockingjay pin in The Hunger Games for example. That allowed the viewer to feel for the relationship between Prim and Katniss and foreshadow Katniss' attachment to Rue. But this movie shows none of that complexity of thought.) And it goes on like that. Every tiny detail is different. It's as if they wrote a totally new story based on the alien idea. I could go on for days with all the differences.... I think the only thing the same is that it's based on an alien invasion. I gave it two stars only because I've seen worse but I was being generous. Rent before you buy.... my opinion is I'd rather have my $3.99 rental fee back. Total waste of money.",1381449600,,1193,4.579439252336448
5216731,5,B0090SI4LU,"My wife and I saw the movie last night on VUDU. We are much older and have seen too many movies to count... we enjoyed the youthfulness of the film. No, we did not read the book. In relation to the reviewer who complains about Saoirse Ronan character or directorship of Niccol's to have Melanie and the Wanderer talk to each other, how else were they supposed to explain having two minds in one body? It was about what she was thinking, the character's thoughts? There would be too many cuts to Melanie or Wanderer if ""acted out"" as the reviewer proposes... and probably a bit nauseating. All in all, the intended audience would need to realize, yes, it's from Stephanie Meyer, an extremely talented and well loved author among who? Yes, the teenage population. This is one for the kids, but surely was pleasant to watch. A great story about the coming of two races akin to a possible 'first contact' in Star Trek as in a possible scenario how we would interact. It was well acted, the music is terrific, cinematography is pleasant, the meaning of the story was well represented.. love, humanity wins out. I get the whole dialogue thing and that the movie is not perfect. But terrible? Not in the very least. Aside from Rotten Tomatoes, which there is a movement for paying off or gifting critics, but anyway, check most other review locations, Netflix (4.25/5), iTunes (4/5), Amazon (3.5/5), VUDU (3.7/5), IMDB (5.7/10)... even on Rotten Tomatoes you get a 51% audience approval as of this date. Clearly, ""The Host"" is well liked by ""normal"" people and over half and sometimes a very high approval such as in iTunes, Netflix. All of the Twilight series is a ""rotten"" tomato, but with a high audience approval. So, it's not perfect, but it apparently resonates with most people, the majority. Movies that are this pace, lose out on most nowadays and that's strange. It's a great ""teenage"" film. Deal with it. If you want my vote for the worst dialogue, look at JJ Abrams new Star Trek: Into Darkness and the other ST:XI. Those both had the worst one-liners, high school dialogue, ""I've gotta be cool"" crap around.",1381449600,,2113,4.682795698924731

To my mind, this film adaptation is very true to the book, including all the major characters and scenes in much the way they're depicted in the original story.

More to the point, this is a good movie with a powerful message about being human. While some of the romance may have been a bit clipped, and the film could definitely have benefited from a couple of more big budget action scenes, overall I'd say it's a successful adaptation and worth renting.",1381104000,,565,4.64
5216770,4,B0090SI4LU,"I loved the book, and initially hated the movie...until I decided to separate the two completely.  It is unrealistic to expect a movie, in two hours, to cover the depth of a book that took over 23 hours to listen to on Audiobooks.  The first difference is the characters...some are missing altogether...and most all of them in the movie are nearly exactly the opposite of what they look like in the book!  Most notably, the Seeker!  Movie version is nearly Nordic!  Tall, blonde and always dressed completely in white...in the book she is very short, dark haired and always...ALWAYS...dresses entirely in black!  The same was true for all the main characters...it was almost as though the person who chose the cast purposely chose actors who did not look like the well described characters from the book.  At the end of the story, the ""replacement"" human Wanda is tiny, ethereal white/blond angelic looking 17 year old girl....in the movie..sort of short, dark haired olive complected ""vampish"" looking very sexy looking woman.
Anyway, once I decided to watch the movie as an entirely different storyline from around the same time in history (like a second book!) and that it was about another ""pod"" of survivors ...  well, then it has its own merits.  Now, having watched it several times, I can accept it as a continuation of the original idea.",1381104000,,1346,4.868421052631579

This movie however was so poorly put together and illustrated I often asked myself throughout the film if this was simply a recording of a high school play or was it just that their budget was so low. The environments they created were so poorly done and the acting was a perfect match for it.

5216988,3,B0090SI4LU,"Stephenie Meyer's The Host is one of my all-time favorite books.  I've read it several times and each time I enjoy it just as much as the first time I read the book, right after it was released in 2008.  I've long hoped that Meyer would release a sequel to The Host (has she decided to just stop writing and work on movies?!) but in lieu of a new book release, I was pacified with the release of The Host movie.

I did not see The Host in the theater; the main reason being that I'm a SAHM to a 2 year old and I really can't get to the movies anymore.  As soon as the movie was released on Netflix, I sat down and watched it.

While I don't think the movie version of a book is ever as good as the book itself, I found the disparity between the book and movie versions of The Host to be quite shocking.  The movie felt flat, unemotional, and cliched to me.  Many of the more emotional scenes in the book were either missing, contrived, or rushed.  The movie seemed to drag and was, at times, boring.  In contrast, I think the book is exciting, full of emotion, and I love the slow build of the relationships between the characters.  The movie was full of what I consider typical alien cliches: very sleek, advanced technology, white and gray clothes, bright and modern silver cars, etc.  I wish that the souls' technology would have been more subtle (as it was implied in the book) and not so abjectly alien.

There was a definite lack of chemistry between the main characters.  If I had not read the book, I would have been unsure as to why Ian and Wanda ever fell in love.  The relationship building was just not there.  At one point, Wanda/Melanie asks Jared to kiss her.  That part in the book was so full of chemistry.  In the movie, it was laughably forced.

I have mixed emotions about the casting for The Host.  I thought Jeb, Jared, Maggie and the Seeker/Lacey were perfectly cast.  I also liked Melanie; however, I wish she would have been stronger-looking.  She's so thin and I always imagined Melanie to have a fighter's build, not a super-slim actress build with very light musculature.  Wanda's character was my biggest casting complaint.  Wanda is supposed to be small, ethereally beautiful, blonde, and delicate.  Wanda's new body was just all wrong (the wrong face, hair, and stature), and it nearly ruined the ending of the movie for me.

My favorite character was the Seeker.  She perfectly embodied the Seeker from the book, and I loved her internal struggle, and the fact that she's hiding a huge secret of her own.  Her drive and determination were admirable, although poorly directed, and I loved the way her storyline came to a close.

The best thing I can say about The Host movie is that it did stay true to the book.  I really appreciate that and liked seeing one of my favorite books adapted into a movie.  I wish that the movie had been longer, to allow for more character development.  There were some important plot points that were left out, due to time constraints, I'm guessing.  The storyline about Kyle and Jodi, as well as Wanda's job before she meets up with Jeb, immediately come to mind.

I realize that this review is full of complaints.  I did enjoy the movie, but had some major problems with it.  I know it's not a movie I'll buy, or likely ever watch again.  It may be worth your time if you can rent it for a low price, but I would highly recommend reading the book instead if you have the time.",1379635200,,3441,4.397781299524564

But it was original with a little bit of si-fi, and I say a little because it was done...""tastefully"". not that I dislike si-fi, but when i learned this movie was coming out I worried that they would over-do the si-fi aspect of the book. i think they balanced it really well--it could have easily gone Men-In-Black-ish, and no one wants that. with most movies coming out these days being about vampires, zombies, or fast and the furious 13, I thought it was kind of refreshing.

as for the acting, it was mostly good. seems more like the awkwardness comes from the directing, the more people that were in the scene, the more awkward it got. the set was good for the most part, considering the majority of this movie took place in 1) stark cement rooms, 2) bleak desert, 3) endless cave.

maybe i wasn't expecting too much, maybe the story distracted me from the less than great aspects of the film (i read the book about 4 years ago, just long enough to remember the jist of the story while forgetting the better details), or maybe the movie was just more good than bad. i feel like a lot of these reviews are pretty harsh (maybe because of it's twilight affiliation?).

5217066,4,B0090SI4LU,"I like the message behind the story. Souls are eternal, and even though we humans cannot inhabit other bodies, the idea of living eternally as a soul hits home to me. I also believe in other worlds, And I think often of what else is out there. Just as Stephanie Meyer portrays peace with her ""aliens"", I never see other worlds as being hostile, only different. Also, the way her aliens are ""beautiful"" in their own way, I feel God's creation spans across the board in artistic design no matter what corner of the universe it is in.",1379462400,,531,4.428571428571429

5217070,3,B0090SI4LU,"It's an okay movie I guess, but it doesn't do the book justice. I guess it's just because there's so much of the book that's thoughts inside Wanda's head. There's not enough dialogue in the book to integrate it into a movie. Plus, there's so much that the book leaves to the reader's imagination, like the true form of a soul or life on other planets, that it's hard to portray in a movie. Since there's a time limit, they left out a lot of important parts that make the book so amazing. They leave out Wanda's teaching position before going AWOL, her storytelling role in the caves, the soccer game tradition that's upheld, Wes' and Walter's death and how it affected her and the community. They breezed by the original hostility of the community and how hard it was for her to get the community to accept her. They especially left out the distrust that everybody in the community had for her, and how long that distrust held out. They also leave out Kyle's tribune after trying to kill Wanda, and the fight itself left a lot to be desired. They left out the internal battle between Melanie and Wanda and Wanda's supply treks out with Jared and Ian. You don't see the community interact as the family they are and you aren't told about anyone other than the main characters. The format and layout of the cave, along with Jeb's little tricks inside the cave was also very different than of the book. Overall, I just don't think it was the right book to make into movie. For those who just saw the movie and didn't like it, don't lose hope. The book is actually quite good, it's my favorite. In my opinion, it's ten times better than her Twilight saga.

From a very linear and predictable story to most of the movie seemingly taking place in dark places or night time, it really left non-readers of the book bored and wanting to just walk out / turn it off.

I'm only giving it 2 stars because of the quality of some of the actors (like Hurt) who must be really doing it for a paycheck / some of the very scenic outdoor shots (wish there were more).

The movie was OK but for me it was not as good as the book.  I won't put a lot of spoilers into this review but the book just simply goes into much more detail and it helps you to understand both sides of the story better.  You gain a feeling for the alien's motives and also the feelings of the humans.

In book the lead protagonist (Melanie Stryder) is a rebel who is a tough and smart woman who is taken over by an alien.  Her responses to situations and her character is tough, intelligent and a real fighter.  In the movie the character comes over more as a pushy and snippy young woman that is much more immature than the Melanie in the book.  It changes the tone of the film in a way that I did not relate to after reading the book.

I liked the premise of the book a lot but movie was just OK.  I thought the cast did the best they could with a chopped up script that just did not carry the story line as well as the book.  For me it is worth watching and perhaps just streaming it to your home but I am not sure if it is worth purchasing the DVD as its replay value is limited.

Why Wanda decided to die instead of keeping the body or going to another planet.

I am not a fan of hers, so to properly review this movie will be difficult to do without bias towards her flaky plots and sexist characters. The filmmakers did the best with what they had--I will give them that one. The acting was okay, but the younger actors were rather amateur and bland. The plot is for the simple-minded (much like Meyer's Twilight saga), though it tries to challenge our views and attempts to deepen our psyche. It's a movie for teens, and though Meyer's novel is stuffed in the Science-Fiction section of bookstores, it's hardly on the level of other Sci-Fi stories that surround it in close proximity. It's a Young Adult fiction novel, and the film is a Young Adult fiction film. I am trying to be as eloquent as possible in my review, but in my honest opinion (as someone who used to gobble these stories up when I was a teen only a few years ago), the film sucked. And that's about the best way I can put it. It was not the worst thing I have ever watched, and it is miles above the Twilight saga, but in the end, it's a mediocre plot (thanks to Meyer's novel) with bland acting, and too simple a ""moral"" for it to make an impact on anyone.

Personally, I think having an attractive actor for the men is great, and they did okay with Jared, but I wasn't sure about the other guy...nonetheless, it was good.

5217625,2,B0090SI4LU,"Like everyone says, the book is great (the audio book is even better as Kate Reading does a spectacular job voice acting).  With that said, there is too much in the book to be made into a 2 hour movie.  It needs to be a miniseries, but more importantly, it NEEDS to be told from a FIRST PERSON POINT OF VIEW.  The movie is in third person, the book is in first person.  The reason the book is so good is that we learn about Wanda and her growth into humanity from the first person--we see/understand everything from her alien point of view!  In the movie this is entirely absent so the ""wow"" factor of the premise is completely lost.  I hope someone with money realizes this at some point and remakes this great book into a miniseries with a first person narrator playing the role of Wanda.

Props to the set designers though...the cave scenes are done well and the lead actress does a good job with bad direction.",1377648000,,914,4.341176470588235

5217762,1,B0090SI4LU,"Have you ever seen a TV show or movie about parasitic aliens trying to conquer humanity? If so, did you ever think, ""If only the aliens would realize what special snowflakes humans are! If only humans would realize that parasitic brain-squids that steal unwilling victims' bodies aren't bad!""

Of course you didn't. Nobody with half a brain would.

But Stephenie Meyer did. The result: a soft sci-fi movie called ""The Host,"" which takes a promising idea (what if the body-snatching aliens WON?) and promptly runs it into the ground. Not only is there pretty much no plot to this movie, but it is riddled with flat characters and a total lack of any kind of excitement. Oh, and there's the romanticizing of aliens who steal bodies.

In the not-too-distant future, the Earth has been completely conquered by a race of glowing brain-squids known as Souls (ugh), who possess human bodies. Only a few actual humans are left. When one girl named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured by the Seekers, she becomes the new host for a Soul named Wanderer.

Immediately after Wanderer is implanted, a Seeker (Diane Kruger) tries to find out where the other humans are hiding. However, the real Melanie is still there, inside her own head -- and her memories begin to affect Wanderer.

When the Seeker's plans threaten Melanie's life, Wanderer/Melanie escape into the desert in search of Melanie's boyfriend Jared (Max Irons), little brother Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and the other free humans. However, they aren't too pleased to find a Soul-possessed Melanie in their midst. And even as Wanderer (renamed ""Wanda"") tries to gain their trust, she finds herself falling for someone who isn't Jared.

It's hard to express just how brain-meltingly dull ""The Host"" is. After Melanie escapes from the Seekers, the movie slows to the pace of half-frozen mud and never speeds up again. Occasionally something dramatic will happen -- the Seeker's attack, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.

Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys. As if the lack of a plot weren't bad enough, we're constantly tortured by Melanie's screeching inner monologue, which tends to break up any moments that could have been quiet.

And really, it wouldn't be a Stephenie Meyer movie unless it romanticized parasitic creatures -- in this case, glowing CGI squids that physically respond to love, peace and kindness. Excuse me while I vomit. Don't expect the movie to address the horrific moral implications of stealing an unwilling victim's body, either -- that would be too deep and intense for a movie like this.

Saoirse Ronan is one of my favorite up-and-coming young actresses, and she does seem to be giving the role her all. But it's a losing battle. Though the movie assures us that Melanie is a rare and special creature with amazing inner strength, she comes across as a bland, utterly typical teen girl with no special qualities whatsoever.

Most of the other actors are completely wasted -- the characters have no development, no history and no motivations. Even the love interests are difficult to tell apart because there's almost nothing to distinguish them. It makes the whole movie feel drained of any drama, because we don't know these characters enough to care -- when two humans commit suicide to avoid the Seekers, all I could think was, ""Who were they again? Did they even have lines?""

""The Host"" is an utter failure as a sci-fi movie -- it takes a good idea and squanders it on a tepid, sluggish story that never bothers to have a real plot. Thankfully, we probably won't get a sequel.",1377561600,10,3745,4.9379968203497615

The human is trapped in their own bodies with no control.  The main character avoided the aliens for a long time but eventually is caught and inplanted with an alien being.  The alien inhabiting her body has sympathy for the human race and ends up siding with the few humans still not possessed.  The story is her struggle to convince the humans she is on their side.

I watched it the same night I bought it, and again the next, and the next . . . .  Then it occurred to me that it was Saoirse Ronan's acting that was so compelling.  Until this movie, I'd never heard of her, but I've probably watched it 6 or 7 times now, and I continue to be amazed by her portrayal of both Melanie and Wanda.  Her actions, expressions, demeanor . . . the only other time I was so impressed by someone's acting ability that it jumped off the screen at me was when I saw Cher in Moonstruck.  Bits and pieces, and sometimes entire scenes of movies are often brilliantly performed, but it's rare to come across an actor/actress who carries that brilliance through the entire film.

One reviewer thought an older actress should have been chosen for the part, but I disagree.  I don't think someone older could have captured the innocence and wonder of Wanderer with the same poignancy Ronan projected.

As well, though nobody likes the bad guy, Diane Kruger did an equally impressive portrayal of the hated Seeker.  And William Hurt was an excellent choice for Jeb.  As with Saoirse, it was as though they lived the roles they played.

The script had a few glitches and repetitive sappy parts, but for me, the acting was so superior, I STILL gave it 5 stars.  Other reviewers found it lacking, and I've yet to come across a guy who enjoys watching a love story, but this movie resonated with me.

I sensed the same kind of ""spunk"" in Melanie through her voice-overs as I did in the novel.  Some might say that she sounded like a brat, but let's be real here... if their body got taken over by some alien after spending years evading the aliens and trying to protect your loved ones, wouldn't you be a p! ssed off too? :-) Ronan's acting also told the story of how conflicted Wanda had become after taking over her host's body.  Uncle Jeb, Maggie, Ian and Jared were also cast well.  If you compare the novel's descriptions to the movie, some of the characters were changed slightly, but I found that the changes were for the better.  The Seeker, Wanda's new host body, and a few others were described differently, but I didn't think that took away from the movie.

2) I liked the movie structure.  While most of it was seen from Wanda's POV, there were some cut-overs to show what the Seeker and some of the other cave dwellers were doing to keep the story flowing.  In a book, it's easy to figure out what's going on based on reading Wanda's thoughts and reactions to things. It is my belief that it would have been a very boring movie if they kept the entire thing in her perspective, so I liked that there were some cut-overs.

3) Overall concept - I feel like the overall concept was executed very well even if there were some modifications from the book.  Even though there changes, I think a viewer could easily understand and appreciate the story even if they hadn't read the book.

THINGS I THINK COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER:
1) I saw the movie prior to reading the novel, and after reading the novel, I understood much more why Wanda did not want to live.  Obviously, condensing a 600+ page book into a 2ish hour movie is a daunting task.  Wanda's background and reasons for not having ""children"" (in an alien sense) were not revealed in the movie.  I think it also would have helped if they had did more to develop how her presence in the cave had continued to cause a divide between the cave population, the friendships she developed with a few of the dwellers and how she felt after some of her only allies had perished really affected her character.  I would have liked to see that explored more.

Overall,  I really liked the movie!",1376784000,,2595,4.425263157894737

5218138,4,B0090SI4LU,"This review is quite difficult. I read the book and thought to myself, ""How will they ever be able to make this into a movie?"" The first third of the book essentially takes place in the protagonist's head. Well, I think that they did a pretty good job at glossing over the difficulties the character went through, but yet still made it understandable. As with any adaptation from a novel, great amounts of story had to be pared down to fit in a two hour format. For the most part, it is done successfully here. However, some of the material missing from the movie does diminish the effectiveness of the climax of the story. Overall, it's a decent movie. (Orders of magnitude better than the ""Twilight"" movies.)

The presentation is pristine, the supplements are adequate, and the sound is fantastic.

Perhaps the world becomes a ""better place"" with the aliens running it, but I don't know why a bunch of ""peaceful souls"" would not see taking over people's bodies as the ultimate act of aggression. And the blond alien is NOT a ""peaceful soul"". I guess just another case of the conquerors lying to those they conquer and to themselves.

So, where have we seen a theme of two males lusting after a single female before? Twilight, of course. I didn't find Twilight to be as boring until the last one I watched, though.

The premise itself doesn't make any sense. The world is taken over by advanced aliens that can occupy the bodies of humans, but then must share their memories and the host can even resist the alien parasite. The parasite can even be sympathetic with the host. Somehow there is still a resistance. They're able to conquer almost the entire world, but small pockets somehow survive.

One of the great things about science fiction is the way it can often grapple with loaded philosophical questions in a way that's engaging and exciting. The plot of The Host offered a great opportunity for dealing with themes surrounding identity in a way similar to Joss Whedon's ""Dollhouse.""

The problem? Stephanie Meyer simply isn't up to the task of handling those themes. All the potential meaty bits of this story took a backseat to 2 contrived romances which were, frankly, unconvincing and unengaging. There was also little to no characterization to speak of, which made it difficult to even care about key plot points. Jamie is such a flat character that his grave illness carries no emotional import whatsoever. The audience is really given little reason to care whether he lives or dies.

5218960,4,B0090SI4LU,"* caution: some mild spoilers *

I have to admit that, based on some of the reviews I read, I wasn't expecting to like this movie. However, I found it extremely enjoyable. It's possible that my enjoyment of the movie is attributable to a) the fact that I loved the book (and therefore the plot) so much, and b) that I watched it with initially low expectations. Having seen it a couple times, I won't say that it's a masterpiece, but it definitely held my interest and I do enjoy it.

Regarding the benefits of READING THE BOOK FIRST:
I absolutely loved the book, and have read and reread it countless times. As such, the plot and content of the book was in my mind as I watched the movie. This allowed me, I believe, to fill in certain gaps and moments of inadequacy in the movie plot and acting (there were a couple iffy moments with the male leads, although overall they were believable), as well as some clichd or corny dialogue, and some important aspects of the character and plot development that I felt were present in the book, but lacking in the movie. For example, if I had watched the movie without reading the book, I don't think I would get the same sense of the affection/love building between Wanda and Melanie, nor would I get the extent of the conflict Wanda experienced in terms of her feelings for both Jared and Ian, or her different reactions to each. Things seemed to happen rather quickly and more superficially in the movie, although some of that may have been necessary (considering the timing and medium). Regardless, I do think that some of my enjoyment of this movie was most likely contingent on my love of the book.

So, this is my advice to anyone contemplating watching or buying it: first of all, don't expect a cinematic masterpiece. This movie is no Twilight franchise, for Stephanie Meyers fans, so watch it for what it is.  If you want an enjoyable couple of hours, go for it.  I also suggest reading the book prior to watching the movie, if you really want to have a good idea of the journey that Wanda (and the humans she comes to love) undergoes.",1375315200,4,2087,4.481578947368421

The aliens take over their human hosts under clinical conditions where the human is sedated. Even their eyes, once joined taken on a soft blue glow.

Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is taken over by a being called Wanderer. Even here their not called aliens, but 'souls'. The 'souls' look like the fluffy 'souls' (Woodsprites) from the film Avatar.

The human psyche is trapped inside their own bodies as a silent observer in what must be a living hell. In Melanie Stryder though her will is powerful enough to interact with Wanderer. She convinces Wanderer to go help her brother. This again 'softens' the aliens. They've taken over the world, imprisoned humans in their own bodies, but as Wanderer, she decides to betray her own race and help the humans.

Even the act of getting an alien out of a host one has to 'coax' it with love and affection.

It's the same with The Hunger Games, and perhaps that's why I liked that movie more. Anyhoo, The Host doesn't dwell over-long on sappy romance, so I was pleased.

The Host is a neat take on an Animorph's yerk-esque theme in which the focus is nearly completely internal. The backdrop of the post-apocalypse is slick and the story itself engaging. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanness of the conversations between the alien Wanderer and her host, Melanie. The actors carry their performances well and the cinematography is interesting and eye-catching. Love (of the caring for people without the sex thing assortment), non-violence, compassion, and redemption are the driving themes of the story, in an enormous contrast to the Twilight Saga that I hadn't anticipated.

5219439,3,B0090SI4LU,"You can feel the stamp of Stephenie Meyer (the 'Twilight' films) all over 'The Host' ... but at least here all parts of the triangle are at least human (well, mostly) - the story a bit more interesting than Bella's whining, as well.

'The Host' opens on an Earth where human beings have all but been replaced by an alien species that can only survive by entering and taking over people, turning us all into emotionless, highly-intelligent drones.  The takeover is total, except in relatively few cases where the human host is actually strong enough to fight the invasion ... at least initially.  Sooner or later, though, it seems that everyone finally lets go as the alien fighting for control wins out.

All, that is, except for Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan).  Part of an underground resistance movement comprised of a small band of humans, Melanie is out scouting with her kid brother and recently-acquired boyfriend Jared, when in order to save her brother she allows herself to be captured.  Immediately implanted, Melanie proves to be a formidable presence within her own body, refusing to relinquish control and even  at times taking over the thoughts and actions of the alien creature - named Wanda - inside her.  When the alien Seekers learn of Wanda's fight to get control, they tell her she'll be re-implanted the next day ... prompting Melanie to make Wanda, who is slowly learning to sympathize with the humans' plight, into running away before the Seekers can learn where the resisting humans - her only friends and family - are hidden.  The problem then not only becomes the Seekers in hot pursuit of Melanie/Wanda (including one, in particular, determined to find the humans), but for Melanie, how to also show up to her friends and family in hiding without getting killed, when they see she's ""become"" an alien host?

Not a great movie, not a lot of great acting here, but the story and plot keeps enough momentum and suspense going to keep you watching, all of course requiring your suspension of belief ... but certainly not to the ludicrous extent that 'Twilight' similarly demanded.",1374883200,,2104,4.868347338935574

Books are always better and The Host while It seemed to drag on forever, it was worth following through to the end.  The movie engendered the same peaceful, warm feeling as the book.  It wound through a myriad of situations and is a tribute to the human spirit.  Of course I always love anything where there is resistance and rebellion and the humans succeed in the end...I will read the whole book and suffer through the entire series or movie with all of its confusing intricacies to get to the fighting back and the win.  While there are a couple of romances and lots of romantic angst in The Host.  If you are looking for adventure and violence or blood and gore you find less in the movie than in the book and there is not a lot there.

The basic premise is in the future, an alien race has invaded Earth by inhabiting the bodies of humans, controlling their actions.  A few isolated pockets of resistance remain.  One resistance fighter, an early-20s young woman, is captured and becomes a host for an alien named Wanderer.  Wanderer finds that the original host is still resisting the alien presence.  The host likes one guy, and the Wanderer likes another guy.  They are conflicted.  Hijinks ensue.

This story is inspiring in its testament to human will, kindness, understanding, bigotry, and inner growth. It is not an action movie. It is not a romance movie. It is not a monster movie. The special effects are subtle rather than amazing. And that may be why it did not find the commercial success of so many movies that are nowhere near as good.",1374796800,,849,4.483870967741935

The main character is supposed to be over a thousand years old - but none of that maturity is ever present in this poor under-talented actress's delivery of a single line. She doesn't even come across as a character old enough to be the battle hardened teen that she was supposed to have been before being taken by the alien parasite.

The idea that aliens come to Earth and try to merge with their human hosts in a good way sounds almost like a Star Trek idea. Everyone getting along peaceably. There is no war, hunger. Everyone has resect for each other. No drug problems or drug wars. But you need to listen to the conversations with the female lead character and her host. It really makes the movie. I was glad to see a female be the lead or main character in the movie. If you like silver cars, motorcycles, helicopters and white clothes you will love this movie.

5219615,2,B0090SI4LU,"I'm one of the only males on the planet Earth who actually admit to liking the ""Twilight"" movies and books. That being said, I have to say I was excited when I heard sci-fi Director Andrew Niccol was adapting Stephenie Meyer's other novel, ""The Host,"" for the big screen. ""Gattaca"" was widely acclaimed and even ""In Time"" received mixed reviews. I was hoping Niccol would at least find a happy medium in between those two and give author Meyer's fans something to be proud of. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I wanted upon viewing the movie.

Aliens have invaded Earth and taken over the bodies of humans as hosts. The process erases the memories of most of the victims. However, a select few have been found to be strong-willed and fight for their individuality and humanity. Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is such a person. Her drive to save her brother (Chandler Canterbury) and boyfriend (Max Irons) from being captured by the aliens creates turmoil within. Melanie battles the entity inside her for control of her body and mind.

I'm going to compare ""The Host"" to ""Twilight"" throughout this review. There's no way to avoid it, so I'll just embrace it and suffer the wrath of millions of Meyer's enthusiasts worldwide. The similarities are too obvious. Both feature a love triangle and deal with a female facing the loss of her humanity. Yes, one is a vampire and the other is an alien. Aren't we just splitting hairs here?

Let's talk about the good aspects of ""The Host"" to begin. The cinematography looks beautiful and adds grand scale to the production. With the exception of one or two scenes, the CGI is convincing and doesn't pull you out of the film. That's more than can be said about the ""Twilight"" movies. Most the acting comes off as genuine, although there's definitely some heavy-handed dialogue for the actors to fumble through.

We now move on to the negative aspects found in ""The Host."" Saoirse Ronan's inner dialogue gets tiresome very quick. I can't necessarily tell you what filmmakers could have used in place of it, but it became painful within the first few minutes after it started. Secondly, the action sequences in the film almost feel forced. I haven't read the book, so I can't tell you if they were added or expanded to give guys ANYTHING to enjoy when they're girlfriends make them watch this.

There's nothing too threatening about ""The Host"" as far as subject matter is concerned. It's a bunch of new age-sounding gobbledegoo about living in harmony with everyone and striving for peace on Earth. It also endeavors to show people can overcome incredible obstacles if they just put their minds to the task. There are a few scenes of sensuality between the three main characters which some will find offensive.

The DVD release of ""The Host"" comes with a few special features for those interested. The featurette ""Bringing 'The Host' To Life"" includes interviews and behind-the-scenes footage. It also contains deleted scenes and ""Seeker PSA"" feature commentary.

""The Host"" isn't going to satisfy anyone except possibly fans of the book. It definitely won't win over any serious sci-fi fans or compel them to pick up the novel. The movie is another failed and dull attempt at starting a young adult fantasy franchise. It's even left open for a sequel, which given the movie's poor box office performance, we'll never get (at least on film).",1374624000,,3379,4.845753899480069

5219849,4,B0090SI4LU,"I liked it because of the fresh sci-fi twist: two entities living in the same woman's body who fall in love with two different men. Interesting to see how the two fell in love with their respecting men, how the men (one of which hated her (both?) at the time but who later changed, and the conflicts which went on with all concerned - of which there were many across several spectrums.

I wished the movie took longer to develop and explain certain scenes - which one is partially answered in the ""deleted scenes"" section of the DVD. Sometimes the movie would stall too long on one point then rush past another point.

Then there was the main antagonist in the movie. I wished there was more history shown of her and more development of her character.

I guess the book goes into these things into detail. But the movie should have covered these main points standing on its own.

But, all things considered, the movie was very good. I gave it one less star due to my criticisms mentioned. The final scenes were emotionally well played. In fact, Saoirse Ronan does a great job physically acting one person and voice acting the other person.

5220040,3,B0090SI4LU,"OK, I'll admit it, in my middle age, I'm still somewhat a romantic at heart! Or, could it be that I see so much drama around me everyday, that watching this teenage romance novel on screen is a short escape from reality?
Either way, I mostly liked, if not enjoyed the movie.

""The Host"" is a slow flowing book, aimed primarily at teenage girls aged 14-19. The movie catches this flow quite nicely. Just like the book, it starts slow and stays that way till the very end. This is NOT and action flick.
The scenery is close to the description. I liked the acting by the entire cast, especially Saoirse Ronan and Jake Abel. William Hurt delivers a nice performance (as usual) and fits the part nicely.
As a rule, I don't like seeing books on screen. There is an inevitable change of storyline and a loss of characters from the book who are deemed unnecessary to the plot. That, however, doesn't bother me as much as the all-to-often deviation in the characters' physical appearances when compared to the book.
What I really didn't like (I'm a stickler for details like this),and this is where the physical appearance of the actor completely deviates from the book, is the choice of Diane Kruger for the role of the Seeker Lacey and Emily Browning for the part of Pat/Wonderer. The total lack of the character ""Jody"" also take something away, although not to noticeably.
Diane Kruger is a fine, very attractive actress, but she is a 5'11"" blond, dressed in all white. In the book the ""seeker"" is described as a very petite brunette who wares all black
Pat is described as a tiny, very frail 16 year old with tons of freckles everywhere. She look like someone you just have to protect.  Mrs Browning is average height, in her mid 20's and relatively wholesome looking.
Futuristic scenery of the cities, cars and motorcycles is pretty believable. Since the movie is set in not-so-far future, the appearance of dress and technology is very similar to our own, so that's a plus.",1374364800,8,1970,4.6257142857142854

5220133,1,B0090SI4LU,"My wife and I fell asleep.  Not sure about her but I just couldn't give a damn from the beginning.  Check this out:

The boyfriend intro was as clumsy as it was bizarre.  The first thing he does is hold a knife to her throat because he thinks she's an alien.  Then seeing she's a human plants a hard sultry kiss on her.  She bats him away.  Chase ensues.  He tackles her and she tells him to get off her.  His excuse for acting like that?  ""Duhhh!  I haven't seen a human in two years.""  Whaaat. . ?  So when you see one your first impulse is to hump it?

So anyway, they get separated and she gets infected with an alien and catches up to him in the desert.  She's overwhelmed with joy at seeing him again and runs to him.  His response?  He backhands her because she's been infected.  This is just weird.  Peoples' emotions seem to be able to turn on a dime with no warning or reason in this movie.  That's big trouble.

But there's a big problem with her characterization as well.  Ultimately, the boyfriend (I don't know his name and I don't care what it is) introduces himself like a rapist: Knife at the throat, hard sloppy kiss, jumps on top.  Now, I'm thinking what kind of female viewer is going to warm up to that kind of guy?  I suppose there are a few women out there who might BUT those women, I don't think, are the same women who would say a little bit later on in the relationship, ""Sleep with me.""  If your boyfriend introduces himself like a rapist, I'm thinking the dialog would be a lot less innocent sounding than that.  Sorry if you're offended but I think a movie should make sense.

So the characterization is totally unbelieveable.  And after they meet again and he smacks her I basically tune out because these characters are as fake as a 3 dollar bill.  This is my first exposure to Stephanie Meyer and I'm wondering if the clumsy, bumbling characterization is one of the reasons writers like Stephen King can't stand her.  I'm not encouraged to see what all the hub bub is with Twilight or her other books.",1374192000,,2034,4.304232804232805

It's a different type of alien movie. No ray-guns, no big space ships, no big time special effects. There are some special effects, but this movie relies mostly on storytelling and acting. When they describe it as a ""Romantic Thriller,"" it's more romance than thriller. For the most part, the movie kept my attention, I liked the characters and felt everything was well done. I felt the movie did fizzle out in a few areas but nothing major. The ending, the very last part, did not seem to fit. An add-on that was a bit too much. Basically, a teenage girl SciFi story.

The lead actress does a pretty decent job. William Hurt is great and if not for his performance, I seriously doubt I would have liked the movie half as much. Mr. Hurt grounded the story and made it much more believable.

This movie is mostly family friendly. No bad words nor nekkied people. A couple of people get shot.

5220282,1,B0090SI4LU,"This could have been a good film. It could have appealed to an audience spanning generations, and it could have been an enthralling science fiction thriller...

Instead, it falls flat. It seems that the director decided that the best way to adapt the original text to a visual medium was to try to make it as much like Twilight as possible. There are entire swaths of film that could have been left out of the final cut, and doing so would have improved the film drastically. It is supposed to be a thrilling experience, yet I never once felt thrilled thanks to annoying and all too common flashbacks of the protagonist and her (sort of) boyfriend.

And when the flashbacks aren't slowing down the plot and boring the audience to death, the dialogue is doing the same. Some movies can survive without fantastic writing, but this is not one of them. In a movie where one of the two main characters is basically a disembodied voice that can only be heard by the antagonist (and the audience), good dialogue is a MUST. I could have put up with the obvious, annoying, and intrusive flashbacks that served no other purpose than to justify the phrase ""romantic thriller"" in the film's description, but only if the dialogue didn't appear to be written by someone who has never actually watched a movie before. As an example... ""You should go to sleep."" And then... ""You should sleep with me."" Really?? Not even in real life is dialogue this terrible.

There are some redeeming factors... The story itself is interesting. Though I haven't read the book, I'm told that Meyer's writing is dramatically improved in The Host as compared to previous titles. It is easy enough to see from the film that the story itself holds a lot of appeal. I also think it is quite creative in some ways. Though portions of the story seem somewhat archetypal (like the body snatching aliens...) other parts are thoroughly intriguing and have not been explored nearly as often in film (some aliens have a conscience and would rather not enslave humanity...). On top of this, the acting is, though not spectacular, solid, and I can't help but feel that the actors involved were hurt by the creative direction of the film.

I feel that I actually can't do this film justice in reviewing it because I'm not bland and uninteresting enough to truly understand it, much less effectively communicate the film's bland, uninteresting execution. This story had a ton of potential for the silver screen, but the movie fails to meet that potential, much less even make a decent attempt at doing so. Unless you have money to throw away or you're a very young, very naive teenage girl who is too busy obsessing over makeup and boys to care, save yourself and don't waste 2 hours on this film.",1374019200,4,2749,4.6853002070393375

Fascinating to create an antagonist who is in the same body as the protagonist at the beginning and trust that the audience will come to understand the many shades of gray (no pun intended!) that the story goes through.

5220340,2,B0090SI4LU,"I'll start by saying, I have not read this book.  I read a bit of Twilight once and almost threw up when I thought about the amount of money this ""author"" has made with some of the worst writing in history (only thing worse is 50 Shades of Gray, but I digress...).  So my opinions are solely based on the movie.

When I saw the trailer for The Host, I was really excited (again, not knowing it was written by Ms Twilight).  I've been wishing for an intelligent sci-fi movie that doesn't have hours of explosions or slime eating someone.  I assumed the film would explore the nature of a world taken over by aliens, hopefully present an ethical discussion of peaceful aliens who ""steal"" the bodies of a species that has been at constant war for thousands of years and is in the process of destroying the planet it lives on.

*MINOR spoilers ahead*

What I got, instead, was sappy nonsense with no real sense of danger, no tension, nothing. I found the whole ""internal dialogue"" between Wanda and What's Her Face (I cared so little, I seriously cannot even remember her name right now) really annoying, and it did absolutely nothing to make me care AT ALL about the girl who's body was taken. In fact, I think a huge problem with this whole movie was that the aliens were far more pleasant and reasonable than the humans, and the lack of any real ethical discussion or exploration of WHY it would even be a negative for these aliens to stop humanity from killing each other left and right meant that the film was unable to develop any real argument as to why the aliens should be fought at all.

I had serious issues with the fact that there was literally no tension whatsoever in the plot.  I kept waiting for *something* to happen, but aside from a few slaps for Wanderer by the humans, pretty much nothing happens this entire movie.  We're supposed to care about the ""romance"" between Wanda/Other Girl and the 2 love interests, but the relationships here are as juvenile and tiresome as those in the Twilight movies.  Just a bunch of 19 year olds ""madly in love"" with each other who just keep kissing - and this is supposed to show the depth of their emotion.  *sigh*

And without saying specifically what the ending IS, I will say that it was the sappiest, most feel-good nonsense I've seen in a while.  It reminds me of those old episodes of Fantasy Island where someone would fall in love with someone in their fantasy and then run into a ""stranger"" who looked just like them afterward!! How convenient!

Maybe the real problem we have is that our culture is so youth-obsessed, it's impossible to get a really strong sci-fi movie anymore.  Because everything has to have these teenagers in it all the time, and so everything turns into this soap-opera garbage romance.  So sick of it.",1373932800,,2788,4.532934131736527

For one, no cool effects or alien technology or anything that really jumped out at me. For two, no real action to speak of. For three, it was basically a girl running around talking to herself the entire film. Unless you want something to help you sleep, don't bother with it.

5220398,4,B0090SI4LU,I loved but like many have said they did change some things but that almost always happens. But I can understand it because they do have to shorten it because you don't want people losing interest. I am a twi-hard and have read all of stephanie meyers books. And am a big fan of her and if they make more to the host I will definetly watch them. You can't expect every movie be perfect with their books. They do have to shorten it and a lot of the peices of the books will get left out. All the actors did a great job at pertraying the characters. Although I do agree that sometimes when they melany would talk she came across like a 14 year old girl. And I love emily browning portraying the new host wanda enhabited. As for a movie I think they did a great job and went very well with the book and still keeping it interesting and not getting boring. Loved adding this to my blu ray collection.,1373846400,,896,4.155172413793103
5220399,2,B0090SI4LU,"I read the book and liked it a lot, I understand that movies can not get everything in the film that is in the book but this movie tried too hard to do just that. What was the result? A piece meal movie that felt like it jerked from screen to seen. The acting was fine, the dialog was not that great, in fact it flat out ruined what was in the book great moments, but this is mainly do the the rushed feel of the scrip. Also due to the nature of trying to do too much in a short movie the characters seem to fall in love instantly, they instantly form bonds that as a viewer you are supposed to believe happened but you don't. To do this movie right it needed to slow things down. sadly that means taking things out of the story or at lest doing something that made the viewer believe that there was more then a few days in the cave for all these feeling and motivations to grow and change.

I really wish they would have made this film in two or more parts so that you can have some character growth in it, and could have some real connections so that the end meant anything close to what it meant in the book.

But I understand how hard it is to make a script when the main character has to talk to herself for most of the movie, but the way it was written it changed the base character of Melanie and made Wanda seem less of an altruistic character.

Read the book and watch the movie for the sole purpose of seeing the backdrop of the book come to life, it was cool to see the cave, the mirrors and the farm and to see the souls there were some great visuals that is for sure but this is not the best telling of the story.",1373846400,,1626,3.98159509202454

5220401,4,B0090SI4LU,"I dragged my feet for a long time to watch this movie, despite or because of the fact I have loved and reread the book twice in the past. It's such a refreshing story to me, it has romance but also such and interesting world and take on an alien invasion where well...the aliens are peaceful and live almost the ideal human utopia. I wish the movie had expounded a bit more on the race of Souls ~ I loved Wanderer's job in the new world being a teacher and her knowledge and experiences in all the other world's she had lived. Her time in the cave and relationships she developed with everyone were also just a glimpse of what the books had.

A lot of things were glossed over and condensed, losing much of richness and character development as well as some of the emotion. I would most likely give it a 3.5 but at the same time, I enjoyed it. A short movie of course will be condensed from such a large book and I really liked what they did with the setting and environment. It definitely brought the book back to life for me and it gives me a chance to share it with others who would probably never read the book. I liked most of the actors, especially Jeb and her brother, Jamie. Melanie/Wanda was good though sometimes came across younger than I felt she should have. Some of the romance felt rushed or cheesy but I expected that. I also expected Melanie's inner dialogue. Wanda never actually spoke to Melanie out loud in the books but then, in a movie that would be confusing at who's thoughts were speaking so I can't complain too much about it.

I think the movie captured the main feelings of the story. It has a slow pacing too it ~ this is not your action sci-fi movie but more a character drama and some romance in a very unusual survival futuristic setting. I would recommend watching it, but will never replace the book.",1373846400,,1834,4.328488372093023

Maybe the people are left without their own personality, but they were given a free benign life. I was very excited that at least one human was able to overcome their hold on them and that humans could even change the aliens and blend their lives for the benefit of all. The movie left out a lot of relevant episodes from the book, but this version of the movie was adequate.

I'm not sure what you'd think of the movie if you've never read the book; I could understand the reviews that say it's a slow movie, but reading the book made me appreciate what they were trying to accomplish.

None of the actors were famous enough that you had any preconceived notions about them, which was refreshing (kind of like The Hunger Games).

If you hate Twilight, don't let that turn you off of this. It's a totally different story, style and atmosphere. The love stories are existent, but don't overwhelm the story.

I'm an avid reader and know better than to expect a film adaptation to provide everything that a 600 page novel can deliver. What I do expect are recognizable characters and plot. I *hope* for visual elements that flesh out a story and make up for detail that won't fit in an hour and a half. What I got was a retrofit that turned a thoughtful story with highly developed (adult) characters into a teen paranormal romance.

So I think it's understandable that I'm a little bit ashamed at how much I liked this movie.  What could elevate a movie with so much going against it?  Two words--Saoirse Ronan, who with this and Byzantium is quickly turning into one of my favorite actresses.  Ronan plays a girl whose body is taken over by a parasitic being as part of an alien invasion of the earth.  The alien and human end up liking each other and the alien (who physically controls the body) runs away to save the human girl and prevent her superiors from implanting her into a more compliant body.  Roman spends almost the entire movie arguing with herself in voice-over as the alien and human communicate constantly inside the girl's head.  It shouldn't work and with nearly anyone else in the lead it wouldn't but somehow Ronan manages to create two distinct, very likable characters.  The Host also has the distinction of featuring one of the strangest love triangles in YA lit history as the human girl and alien (who share the same body) fall in love with two different young men.  Beyond Saoirse Ronan The Host's chief pleasure are in the film's clean, shiny production design (always a strength in Andrew Niccol films--he's a consummate stylist, even if he usually gets very little else right) and effective performances from William Hurt as Ronan's kindly uncle and Diane Kruger as the villain, an alien intent on wiping out the remaining pockets of the human race.  Plotting wise this is about as corny as you would expect from a Stephanie Meyers adaptation but Saoirse Roman cuts through the general silliness and really makes you care about what happens to her human and alien characters.  If this had starred Kristen Stewart (Bella from Twilight) it would have been completely unwatchable--she can barely play one character, let alone two, but Saoirse Ronan, through sheer force of talent or will makes The Host worth seeing, if not quite a must see.

There was some action, it was interesting, and the cast was pretty good.  Give it a try. There are plenty of adults in the movie, so I don't think it is just for teens. (I never go by who it's meant to entertain anyway.  If I want to see something, I just see it!)",1373673600,2,747,4.117241379310345
5220516,3,B0090SI4LU,"The Hollywood label of ""science fiction"" sadly mostly denotes violent movies with aliens killing people, lots of special effects and little to really tease the mind. This is the opposite--a rare science fiction film which focuses on ideas and human stories, and which appeals to our imaginations.

What I love about this movie is how it convincingly and chillingly portrays an imagined future world. Creating a futuristic world (particularly a dystopian one) is the main strength of director Andrew Niccol and he did it beautifully here. The sterile and orderly look of an earth taken over by aliens, superior in some ways to us, was brilliantly done--down to the chilling grocery stores devoid of brand names and even checkout counters. There's one thirty-second scene in a store which, at least for me, was worth the entire movie.

But the brilliant world building was completely eclipsed by one of the worst scripts I have ever seen in any movie. Usually even the most boring hackneyed scripts are at least reasonably professional in a dull conventional kind of way. This one--while tantalizingly creative--was simply amateurish. It almost completely failed to meet the most basic requirement of building a plot arc that keeps us interested and engaged...not to mention poor character development and flat, dull dialog. The excellent actors, William Hurt and Saoirse Ronan among others, did a valiant job with almost nothing to work with, but oh, what a waste of such a great cast!

 Like the book, the movie script focused on emotional and human impact of the alien-themed plot, rather than on violence and action. I like that. But, the movie script--like the book--slogged along with no strong plot tension, no sense of timing or urgency, poor dialog, nonexistent character development. This is due largely to it fairly closely following the book, which was wonderful, for an amateur writer, but it just didn't have what was needed to make it into a good movie. Someone should have had the guts give the movie the professional overhaul it desperately needed.  If they'd taken the book as a starting point and hired a competent, seasoned writer to revamp it completely, this movie could have been on the level of Gattaca.

It's sad really. I don't know if Andrew Niccol didn't know how to reimagine it or if he didn't have the go-ahead to do so. But if you're a fan of real science fiction (about ideas, not about violence) and if you like dystopic tales, you should see this anyway. It's a passably good rainy night bowl of popcorn don't have too high an expectation kind of movie.",1373673600,,2586,4.919724770642202
5220517,3,B0090SI4LU,"The book was a melodramatic hot mess that dragged on...and on...and on.  The movie was mercifully shorter, but like many movies made of long books, it's very choppy, a lot was changed (not that that was necessarily a bad thing), and the romantical portion of the story (which was a huge part of it) was unconvincing.  Besides that, Stephanie Meyers' martyr-like girl main character gets irritating very quickly.",1373673600,2,411,5.029411764705882
5220518,5,B0090SI4LU,"I was so excited to get this movie through Amazon Instant, but also apprehensive. To my delight, this movie exceeded my expectations. I'm one of the many who fell in love with The Host and have read it many times. The emotional roller coaster, the philosophical questions about the body and soul and the different perspective on aliens were some of the things I loved about it. I was worried that my hopes would fall short for the film. Overall, I think it did great!

There's only so much you can fit into a 2-hour long movie and the film added more ""action"" scenes than the book. This left me surprised but happy too. If the movie followed the book so closely, it would have turned into a 3 1/2 hour long affair, and would have dragged on even more. In this way, it can stand on it's own.

I've watched it twice already since buying it and it still makes me tear up in many different scenes. This may be because I remember these scenes in the book and remembered how painful it was to read them and why those scenes were important. I wonder if people who haven't read the book would pick up on the emotional scenes like how my sister and I did. The one thing that would have made it 4 and 1/2 stars was that I couldn't always feel that emotion in any of the actors at certain times. Jared wasn't angry enough and Wanda didn't act as frightened or sad as the book portrays. The actor who played Ian, Jake Abel, pretty much was the best along side William Hurt. So yeah - basically missed the emotion and conflict that the book so well described. This might be the divide between the capabilities in writing a book and a script. Even so - it still makes me cry!

Regardless, if you are or are not a Host fan try it out and see! It may surprise you.",1373673600,,1748,4.227544910179641

It was one of the most stupid, sappiest movies I've ever seen. I suppose if you like dumb juvenile love stories with contradictions throughout the storyline, you might like it, because I can't imagine where these favorable reviews are coming from. I can't figure out why William Hurt agreed to play in it. I will say his character was the only decent acting/character in it, but then again, he didn't have to play a sappy, lovesick teen.",1373673600,,607,4.527272727272727

Very well done and I usually read the book before I watch the movie.  I am glad I did not in this case.  I had just watched Pacific Rim with my son at the local IMAX 3D and was amazed at the special effects but it was missing something, like a story.  The Host filled in the gap and I am very glad I watched it.  I guess I am saying it was better than Pacific Rim in my book!",1373673600,,484,3.605769230769231
5220576,4,B0090SI4LU,"I never knew Stephenie Meyer wrote anything besides Twilight until I saw a coworker reading The Host one day. She told me it was Meyer's attempt at writing something for a more mature audience. I knew I wasn't going to read it, but I did want to see the movie when it hit DVD.

The concept is that aliens have taken over most of earth. They are a peaceful race and humans serve as hosts for the alien souls. The conflict arises from a group of humans who live in hiding who are confronted by one of their own who was recently captured, all while the alien seekers are trying to find them. Could an alien switch sides?  Is it possible for the human soul to still be alive inside their body? If so, can the human soul interact with the alien now living in its body?

Saoirse Ronan does a great job in the lead as Melanie (the human) and Wanda (the alien). Her voice is in a slightly different register to help you determine which is speaking, though only the alien as function of her mouth when she takes over, and Melanie is an interval voice. She is surrounded by a young cast of mostly unknowns - but that's pretty much how the cast of Twilight started out too. I did recognize Boyd Holbrook only because I'd watched him on The Big C and recently in Behind the Candelabra.

For those who prefer their alien fiction a little more fast paced, blow-them-up, giant space craft, war-type films, you'll hate The Host. There is nothing more than a bit of blood shed. The aliens themselves are even tiny, white, sea urchin-looking things. If you are looking for a different and interesting teenage romance, Meyer has served you that dish again just as she did with her previous books.  And there are some new and interesting concepts here when it comes to the whole romance thing: Melanie's lover, Jared, is there in the group. And another member of the group falls in love with Wanda. How does Melanie get Jared, her young brother, and the group to realize that she's still alive in there? Can they save her? What will happen to the alien?

There are also a lot of underlying themes about the soul and reincarnation to explore here, which really makes this a serious and phenomenal film. Look past the young inexperienced cast and the fumbling romance stuff, and you will be rewarded with a film that is worth the watch. There's a great line in the film where the humans have been experimenting violently with extracting the aliens from the humans.  Wanda tells them it will come out peacefully if they just basically ask it to. It's very true of the way humans look upon those who are different or those who could be a threat. We act out in anger.

Like everyone else, I loved making fun of Twilight even though I watched all four films.  The Host has given me a new respect for Meyer if she continues to write stuff like this.",1373673600,,2822,4.4324324324324325

Mainly because of the horrible job they did with Twilight. Again when I saw the preview I was even more concerned. I thought at first the actors they chose were not what I had pictured in my mind when reading the book especially the actor who was going to be playing Ian ( as he is my favorite character of course). But I can say that my concerns were not necessary. I really enjoyed this film. I thought all the acting was really good. They stuck as close to the book as possible for a movie. The book is rather long and for them to have everything from the book the movie would need to be at least 4 hours. But I think for a 2 hour movie they did really really well.

So, I suppose, I unfairly judged how The Host would be.  This movie isn't an action-packed scifi flick and it's not the extremely heavy-handed romance that Twilight was.  Instead, it's character-driven and I loved it because of that.  I grew attached to the Wanderer.  I thought the movie was well-acted and the plot was interesting.

I am going to buy this movie after having only rented it, it is that good. I wouldn't expect it to win any awards, but it is definitely entertaining and worth watching. Saoirse is a talented young actress and I was pleasantly surprised at the acting caliber of the supporting cast. I thought the book was a good read (if a little slow in parts), but the movie is even better. I can see teens enjoying this movie for the romantic love-triangle aspects, but I am not a teenager and thoroughly enjoyed the movie for itself.

The scenario from the book is reasonably basic.  It proceeds as follows.

Melanie gets caught, alien gets put in, alien tries to live her life (educator), Melanie interferes

Plot shift

something something spoilers alien gains acceptance within human group, something something emotional ending

The movie robs the viewer of all character development, the alien's shift in perspective, Melanie's relationship with her alien invader, the humans who should have had some form of reason to like the alien are never given the opportunity to display why.

It is aggravating,The Host is a good book one that deserved a good showing instead we got a movie that highlighted some events but not enough removed the when and why and gave us a drama in action movie format.  Everything was compressed to the point of no meaning.  Do yourself a favor get the book, don't even trifle with this garbage.",1373500800,,981,4.96319018404908

I do know that the background music drove me crazy! Mortuary parlor music played all through the movie. After listening to it for 2 hours, I felt like I had a chemical lobotomy! The movie would have been much better with NO MUSIC.
Again, Saoirse was cast in a poorly written movie. I love that young lady. I hope someone wises-up and finds her some good scripts.
I'm worried about her net worth too. She only has $ix million in the bank. She is a talented actor and should by this time have 20 mil.
And for goodness sakes, please do not put her in any more sexual or romantic scenes. I love her, but she is no Marilyn Monroe. She could not do a romantic scene to save her soul. She's not that kind of actor. She obviously gets no please from kissing men. She is very mechanical doing it. I'm not sure she is turned on by males. The best kiss she ever gave was in the movie Hanna when she kissed her female friend. Well, I give her a 4 for carrying this movie. I give the movie a 2. I give the music a minus 50.

The concept is great. Saoirse Ronan is superb as the lead. William Hurt is perfect in his role. I think they did about as good as they could have with this story in a 2 hour movie.

Could it have been better? I think so. Most of the flaws that detracted from slightly from my enjoyment all came back to some things being rushed to fit the run time. Given the disappointing box office results, probably good that it wasn't split into two films, as we may never have seen the second half, but it would have been better if they could have made wise use of an additional 30 minutes to develop the key relationships.

It's sort of sad that over the top Twilight hate seems to have had blowback on this film's reception, being based on a book by the same author.

The writers of the film are in top form and all the actors make  what should be a far fetched story come brilliantly to life. I can't recall seeing  a film with such depth  in some time. Hang in there with the slow pacing especially at the beginning because it takes a stride or two to see what is actually unfolding.

The perfect, or emotionless and mindless society advanced by ""superior"" beings may be a view into the future.  But what price must humans pay for such boring perfection?  There must never be a guarantee of a perfect, intellectually and emotionally dead society when the individual has so much humanity within.  If there is a message to this film it is for individuals to fight against the domination of a society that pursues some goal of inhuman mechanistic perfection in exchange for comfort.  Life is not lived for the anesthetic comforts a society or government can deliver in exchange for its preservation of power.  Life is a vital experience to be lived without the presence of dictates of those who believe they know better than any individual how a life must be lived and experienced in full.

5220711,2,B0090SI4LU,"The Host is a movie about aliens who threaten mankind by taking over human bodies and erasing their memories. Melanie fights for her body against an alien know as the wanderer.

When I originally saw the trailer for this, I thought that this had an interesting concept for a plot line and if done the right way, would be great. I am not familiar with the original book on which this is based, so I don't know how far it is off there but that is not the problem with the movie.

But after watching the movie to me, this seemed like a low budget version of Twilight or a movie idea that should have been a mini-series or a TV series idea that they decided to make as a movie. And although this may appeal to those fans of the Twilight series and those in that demographic, the talking in your head concept of alien takeover just didn't translate well to me on the big screen. It seemed a muddled mess that had long stretches of nothing going on except unbelievable behavior and romances by the characters. Sci-fi doesn't have to be all action but at least give me some type of action. 90 percent of the movie is set in a cave in the desert where amazingly the most exciting thing going on is the wheat being grown there. The acting and character interaction was almost as bad as the movie concept.

If done a different way, this movie had a lot of promise, unfortunately the way they brought this to the big screen, just didn't translate to me. A shame too, as this could have been a great story.",1373414400,6,1494,4.290780141843972

5220713,2,B0090SI4LU,"How do you make a movie about an alien invasion boring? Ask the producers of this film.
The Host is a pretty interesting idea for a movie that goes nowhere, even the aliens look bored.

Instead of brain-sucking, these small, glow worm-like aliens unpack their bags inside people's skulls, taking control over their human condos.
The movie centers around one nondescript human girl who gets evicted from her body but never leaves. Stuff happens, lots
of staring and talking to herself and she winds up befriending a group of ""resistance fighters"". More staring and Vangelis-type music,
and then there is a romantic triangle between the girl and two guys ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz......

The Host is not just boring, its unrealistic, even for a science *gag* fiction film.
Do you really think Beau and Zeke would hide in a mountain, growing wheat
during an invasion by glowy-eyed, pacifist aliens? Finding new ways to grill them Cajun-style maybe.
Everybody in this film acted like they were on Prozac. John Hurt plays the leader of the resistance. He says what is supposed to
be some wise stuff, but all I heard is ""you are getting very sleepy, verrrrrry sleeepy..."". ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz........
I won't give away the ending, but anyone NOT under the control of an alien would have guessed the ending 15 minutes into the movie
anyway.

However, the cinematography is very good and the movie is very relaxing - see it after getting a massage! But be careful, stop
the film before the closing credits or else you will be blasted by this brain jarring ditty by They Might Be Dragons, er, I mean
""Imagine Dragons"" = ""WELCOME TO THE NEW AGE, TO THE NEW AGE!!!!!!!!!!!!"" - *gasp*. I almost flew out of my seat, I guess this was useful
to get people in theaters to wake up.

The book is long and drags out in the middle of the story but the movie does well in making it go fast paced. I like the protrayal of the Seeker, in the book it was confusing and in the end she was annoying as her human self. But the movie did it well, Diane Kruger is a great actress! I was excited to see who would be playing Wanda as her new self but Im not a big fan of that actress, don't like her acting. I also was hoping they would show a part in the book where Wanda sees a ""alien"" couple with an infant but the infant was left human.

In regards to the BluRay disc. Depending on the type of player you have, and the speed of your internet, might want to disconnect your internet from the BluRay player before you try to watch the disc a second time (My GF watched it before I did).

If I could get the 30 minutes of my life back that I wasted watching the first part of this movie, it would still need to be burned from my memory. I am NOT over reacting. It is the worst movie made in 2013 bar none.

Where do I begin? The constant narration and second voice talking is annoying and the acting is as if they were doing a short film for free. The plot line is explored so clumsily that it has no excitement. The two leads have as much chemistry as Hillary and Bill Clinton. The flash backs come at the wrong times. The ""aliens"" are very style conscious and materialistic. You can see the blond chick ""seeker"" wearing thong underwear thru her slacks. They drive a pimped out car that would attract attention, yet the other ""aliens"" drive 1980's Volvos.

The Host

From the book of the same name by Stephanie Meyer. Time of show, 1305hrs, Cost of Tickets $6:00 each.

Cinema AMC Colonial 18

825 Lawrenceville-suwanee Rd
Lawrenceville, GA 30043

After all the hullaballoo surrounding the Twilight series by Stephanie Meyer, of course I had a little look at the books at the library. I'm only marginally interested in what has become Young Adult writing, and I've never had any interest in Vampires whatsoever. They weren't my thing at all.

I wasn't much interested when the book, ""The Host,"" came along, but the original cover was so creative and was such a beautiful haunting image, well, I bought the book.

So sue me. I had no idea it would become my favourite book ever. Even eclipsing the riotous, ""Fat Ollie's Book,"" by Ed McBain.

They HAD to make a film out of it. For some time, despite the clamour of the fans, not much happened until Saoirse Ronan signed on in about 2010. It meandered about in development hell until we were finally informed it was coming out in 2013.

It is fair to say that the critical acclaim has been missing. At Rotten Tomatoes the procrits give it 11%, while the audience gives it closer to 60%. Both are ridiculous low numbers, and would be for films which are utter crap. There's something else going on here, as if someone doesn't like Meyer's view of the world, or what, I don't know. The critics are unreasonably harsh, when they were gaga over the complete tripe that was, ""The Avengers.""

Do we not seek drama with tragedy and a happy ending any more? Do we just want explosions and gals dressed in leather? Big, hairy men dressed in spanx?

Maybe that is what we want. Shoot, weez in trubble.

The Host's essence is love, or perhaps the power of love. I have opined many times that it has parallels to the story of Jesus of Nazareth. That view has been universally mocked. Which makes me think I am an alien or as mad as a box of frogs. The similarities in the stories, the sacrifice, the re-incarnation, the trans-substantiation of a spirit/soul into another body?

Seems clear to me. Hah, wouldn't be the first time I've disagreed with the entire world.

The action takes place in some Western Desert location, later revealed to be New Mexico. I liked the peculiar white look of the scene making and the simple construction of the shops and their contents. Susan, my spouse stated that perhaps there could have been more introductory exposition as to why the Aliens/Souls came to Earth and took it over. On that point, there wasn't much exposition in the book, so if Director Niccol added it, I would have found it outside his aegis. Which is to tell the story in the book, even if he must truncate that, as film must.

Wanda's wander into the desert is much shaved from the book, which is a good thing. The spectacular car crash was a bit daft. Safe Volvo's might be, but surviving a roll-over at that speed would be beyond any human I know of. Dis is da movies, don't try that at home.

William Hurt out-Jebbed Uncle Jeb. He was perfect in a role which could have been cloying, but it was deftly done. Excellent work by a fine actor. Susan thought Hurt was Jeff Daniels. (She identifies anything in a beard and above 40 as Jeff Daniels.)

The young men, were handsome young men. Very tall logs of wood. Not required to do much acting, as is the modern way, and they had spent much time in the gym getting ready for their roles.

Diane Kruger was excellent as The Seeker. Not quite the creature of the book, but compelling and vulnerable at the same time. Long and lean, the camera enjoyed looking at her and her impossibly long, graceful legs.

To be fair, so did I:)

There's been a lot of rabbiting about how the double indentity of Wanda/Melanie was to be handled. Some people have been critical, but here's the thing, if you can't tone down your skepticism for a movie about Aliens coming and taking us over, when is it that you do? You must suspend disbelief, or no movies makes sense at all. Movies are about magic, and this was magic.

I found the voices off, with a different tone and accent to delineate the two characters convincing. Saoirse Ronan's facial expressions during this difficult technique just right. It was a fascinating challenge for the film maker and the actor, and they pulled it off. I have always said that I would have chosen Summer Glau for this role. Glau is perhaps too subtle, very technical and has an ethereal nature that would have given the role a different feel, for me.

Ronan was chosen and that's it, she did a great job. Whaddoino? I'm no director.

There is a scene in the book, in, ""The Docs,"" room. Wanda stumbles on humans attempting to extract souls from taken over human bodies. This process kills both parties. It is a pivotal and tragic scene. The filming and drama of this scene and those that follow, with the representations of the souls/aliens was very convincingly done and beautiful, if tragic. It reflects the question Capt Adama asks at the beginning of Battlestar Galactica. ""What we did, what we do, there has to be a purpose, what is it and is it worth it?""

At the end of the movie, I asked a few people close by what they thought of it. Most gave it 8/10. Maybe they were reacting to the rather strange man with the odd accent who isn't from rahnd heah. I choose to hope they were being honest.

I said right from the start that I would be happy if Niccol and his band of players took the project seriously and addressed its themes with care. They did that, in spades. In my opinion, it made a super movie. The haunting themes of vulnerability, love and the power of that love to supersede everything came through loud and clear.

I loved it. Ignore the critics and go and see it. 9/10

The lead actress played a fantastic part. I thought this was a great adaptation of the book.

William Hurt does a great job as the crazy survivalist uncle and I agree with the other reviewer who noted how well the main actress portrays two characters inhabiting one body.

5220965,5,B0090SI4LU,"I absolutely loved this novel, and as far as movie adaptations go it's not the worst I've seen. It needs to be understood that this book is over 600 pages long, and in order to condense it, things needed to be cut. Also, because of it's author this movie was scoffed at by many before they even saw it. Yes, it's Stephenie Meyer who is now infamous for catering only towards young romantics, but that doesn't strictly apply towards The Host. This book/movie is such a step away from the Twilight series and not many were able to see that. Yes, there is kissing and romance, but at it's core, The Host was a story about love and its varying forms. Meyer herself said The Host was science fiction for people who don't like science fiction, and I think that is 100% accurate. The story itself is something to marvel at; aliens invading and taking over bodies might not be a first, however the specific story line of the movie is.

As far as the acting is concerned, the fact that Saoirse Ronan was able to portray two completely different people in the same body is amazing. There isn't an easier way to have the two main characters talk to each other when they share a body than voice overs. They were necessary to the plot despite what people may say about how they sounded. She has since become one of my favorite actresses since seeing this movie and her other work. Max Irons was incredible as Jared Howe, and while not a huge fan of Ian O'Shea, I felt that Jake Abel did a wonderful job. All of the supporting cast was good as well, and helped to further the story line. The music was great and I found the movie to be well worth the money I spent on it.

While it may be beneficial to first read the book if you are easily lost in a movie, it's not necessary. They were able to get the basic story line across and that is what matters with an adaptation. Overall, I loved the film and look forward to seeing it many more times to come.",1372204800,3,1939,4.2806539509536785
5220966,2,B0090SI4LU,"This is the absolute not the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my life, but its really dam close. The book is not all that great to begin with but this movie is just downright bad. Now I don't know how hard it is to have the main part in this film (wanderer) but it look like they needed a more experienced actress for the part. Not that she is bad, just think that someone more experienced could have pulled it off better.

Also I feel they could have explane things a lot better earler in film, I mean why should Wanderer even care for these humans that where her body's family not hers. I know in the book they explane and go into more detail but the what 10-15 min they give us was just not enough time to get why she even cares to start driving in the desert looking for them. Now it does a better job at this about an hour into the film but before that expect to be a little bit lost.

I don't hate the movie I just was extremly disapointed with it. Read the book and save your money, I guess you could get this at redbox its worth 1-2 bucks and a quick afternoon if you don't have anything else to do....",1372118400,2,1124,3.991111111111111

I just watched the movie recently and now I want to re-read the book. Somehow I feel like I enjoyed the movie even better. The lead actress and the Seeker did an awesome job, as did Melanie's uncle and Ian. I love the romance with Ian especially. I liked it in the books, but it somehow feels even more adorable on screen. I also enjoyed the special effects. That cave was especially amazing and always a little hard to picture in my head while reading the book descriptions. Imagine Dragons' ""Radioactive"" is also a perfect fit for the soundtrack. If you liked the book, you'll probably love the movie.

Another part that should have been included was about a character they left out of the movie.  I don't remember his name, but he was dying of cancer, and they learned that she had compassion for people other than her/their brother.
  I know that it was probably budget reasons for some things not included in the movie, so I can understand things like this, I do wonder if the director read the book.

5221025,2,B0090SI4LU,"I understand that not all movies can translate the original book well, and I am usually okay with changes to the storyline/characters if it ends up being a a better MOVIE. However, after seeing the film, I was left unsatisfied. I understood it would be awkward to bring to the screen since most of the discussion between Melanie and Wanda is internal, but even with low expectations, it fell short.

Several characters from the book were not mentioned in the film, such as Sharon. Doc's character was also not really developed, although he is in the film. However, these were changes I could accept, because the change helped focus on some of the main characters, and the plot details were fixed accordingly for the film.

Something I was NOT okay with was how Wanda/Wanderer seemed so weak in the movie. In the book, she comes off as strong in addition to being pacifist. Her background and decisions in the book showed her strength. However, in the movie, many of these scenes were changed to be Melanie leading instead. Some examples from the movie (spoiler alert) include Melanie being the one to tell Wanda how to get the medicine at the hospital and Melanie telling Wanda to not tell people she's alive at first. To make Melanie be in so much control of the body, of all the decisions -- it was a bit tiring to see Wanda's character ask Melanie about everything, and it made me feel like there was not as much depth to Wanda's character. It's as though the writer/director wanted the focus to be Melanie, when I thought the original story has them both be strong heroines.

Some things I did enjoy was how William Hurt portrayed Uncle Jeb, which I thought matched the personality in the book exactly. Saoirse Ronan seemed like a better Wanda than Melanie, but seemed more frail than I expected for the character of Melanie. Max Irons/Jared felt a little stilted and I didn't ever get a sincere feeling from his acting with the exception of his first encounter with Melanie. (I'm not sure how much of that is the fault of the acting, or the awkward translation of the film.) Diane Kruger also portrayed the Seeker well for the movie (accounting for the character changes in the movie), and I believe she was the best as showing the fraying control to the host body.

Overall, if you're new to ""The Host"", I highly recommend reading the book instead.",1370131200,4,2354,4.6378896882494

5221029,2,B0090SI4LU,"How do you turn a 619 page bestseller into a movie? Andrew Niccol had the challenge of directing the adaptation of Stephenie Meyer's The Host. I have been a huge fan of The Host since I read it in May 2012 and I had such high expectations for this movie. I was pretty disappointed with the film adaptation of The Host.

  The Host starts off with a bang and immediately takes viewers into the complex world of the Souls and Hosts. Saoirse Ronan is a rebel named Melanie who gets captured by the Souls and she becomes a Host to Wanderer (Wanda). Wanda's job is to find Melanie's brother (Chandler Canterbury) and Melanie's boyfriend, Jared (Max Irons). Wanda is not prepared for the troubles of being human. Wanda meets up with Jamie and Jared but not everyone is happy to see her. Ian (Jake Abel) soons become entangled in Melanie's life.

  The Host is pretty true to it's source material, there are only a few differences between the novel and movie. The problem is not with the concept of the movie but how The Host is executed. I feel like the cast members of The Host lacked passion for their characters.

  A majority of the acting in The Host lacks the raw and powerful emotion found in the novel. Saoirse Ronan does a decent job at playing both Melanie and Wanda. I didn't really feel any empathy toward Melanie and Wanda when I saw the movie. When I read The Host, both characters really struck a chord with me emotionally. Both love interests Jared and Ian weren't exactly convincing in portraying their characters. I didn't feel like Ronan had any chemistry with Irons or Abel, the romance just didn't feel existent. Sure, Ronan kept locking lips with Irons and Abel but I didn't think their characters true felt any love towards each other.

  I think the most exceptional performances are carried out by Diane Kruger and William Hurt. Kruger's portrayal of The Seeker was extremely terrifying and powerful. Every single time I saw Kruger character, I was ready for a fabulous performance. William Hurt was the best choice for Jeb and his portrayal of Jeb was simply perfect. Hurt shows so many different angles of his character and his performance truly captured the essence of Jeb's character.

  Plotwise The Host moves at a ridiculously slow pace and I think the movie should have been edited better. The transitions between each scene were not smooth and were a bit on the awkward side. The Host is about what it means to be human and yet this message seemed to be lost in this adaptation. There was none of the powerful messages and motifs that I remember reading about it Meyer's novel.

  Also lost in translation to the big screen was Jared and Ian. Jared and Ian were huge parts of the novel and yet in the movie they didn't feel so significant. The ""love box"" (4 love interests) felt extremely fake because the viewer can't connect with any of the main characters. Jake Abel's performance is extremely unconvincing, he transitions almost instantaneously from wanting to kill Wanda to falling for her. I expected to see Abel slowly fall in love with Wanda but this was not the case. The dialogues between Wanda and Jared and Wanda and Ian were extremely memorable in the novel. This movie adaptation doesn't feature 95% of my favorite quotes from the novel.

  I seem to focus on what I didn't like but there were many things I really liked about The Host. I loved the way all of the futuristic technology was shown in The Host. Also all of the action scenes were extremely intense and well done.  I would love to see more of the action scenes because I really enjoyed watching them. It was interesting to see how the makers of The Host's interpretation of Souls. Though I complained about the acting in this film, the acting wasn't terrible.

  The Host is a mediocre movie ruined by unconvincing acting, an extremely slow pace, and badly written script. While watching The Host I was extremely antsy and I feel like this movie could have been a half hour shorter. I know all of the cast members have expressed interests in making The Host a franchise. I would definitely see a sequel but I would probably wait till it gets released on DVD.  I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the novel. The novel is far better than the movie and I would recommending reading the book instead.

5221034,4,B0090SI4LU,"I am not a huge Twi-hard fan. I do like the movies (even though i thought Eclipse was WEAK), i read Twilight and thought some of it was boring and tried to read the rest of the Twilight books but they just didn't hold any interest for me. Out of all of the Twilight movies the last two movies (Breaking Dawn part 1 and 2) of the series are my favorites.

Now onto Stephanie Meyers's The Host. I didn't read the book, i thought about reading it before i saw the movie, but i just said forget it and decided to watch the movie instead. I don't know how the book is, but personally i really don't care because i REALLY LIKED this movie. I thought it was such an interesting story, and no offense to the Twilight fans, but i think this book/movie is a little bit more realistic (alien's taking over our bodies) rather than believing vampires and werewolves are real.

If there was an alien race like this, than i would hope that we as humans can still fight them, even when they have taken over our bodies. And that's what Melanie does, even though Wanderer/Wanda has taken over Melanie's body, she is still in there.

If you really liked the book, then there might be a chance you might not like the movie. When i was a teenager i loved the book ""Blood and Chocolate"" and when they finally made a movie out of it, i was excited. I watched the movie and absolutely HATED IT. I was angry that they didn't even TRY to get as close to the book as possible.

Whenever they transfer a book into a movie, they never get as good as the book, they try (most of the time), but they never quite get it perfect. That's because books have a lot more detail than movies, and if you wanted everything perfect like the book, the movie would probably be 3 or 4 hours long. This movie was two hours and ten minutes.

I would love it if Stephanie Meyers did a sequal to this book so they could make a sequal to the movie, because i feel that there can definitely be more to this story. If you are an alien/sci-fi fan then you might like it. I would say watch it first and then decide. Don't look at the three stars or what other people are ragging about with this movie, make up your own mind on it.",1367193600,5,2177,4.173809523809524
5221065,5,B0090SI4LU,"As someone who read the book prior to seeing the movie adaptation of The Host, I have to say that I had very high expectations going into the film. And, if I'm being totally honest, the film did not measure up to the incredible world created within the pages of Meyer's novel. That being said, however, I feel that it is imperative to also point out that movie adaptations of novels ALWAYS come with limitations. It is impossible to fully capture everything that makes the book great in the allotted two-hour timeframe of a typical movie. And The Host was certainly no exception to this rule. Still, I did find this movie to be entertaining and compelling in and of itself for a number of reasons:

*NOTE: Spoilers ahead.*

1. Saorise Ronan does a good job portraying two characters trapped in the same body. She accurately depicts Wanda's rigid, alien way of speaking, as well as throwing in a slightly southern-twinged accent for Melanie, who hails from Louisiana in the film. All in all, I felt that she was a strong female lead for the film.

2. Max Irons gives an impressive, albeit limited, performance of Jared Howe. Irons was able to capture the struggle and hurt of Jared (caused by losing Mel and then having her body return with another soul inside) and convincingly portray those emotions on-screen. The only criticism I have about this character in the movie does not stem from Irons' portrayal; rather it stems from limitations in the script, which I'll explain in more detail below.

3. The special effects in the film are really impressive. From the alien souls to the much-accelerated wound healing, the special effects are definitely one aspect of the film that cannot disappoint.

4. The setting and the scenery in the film are phenomenal. Not only does the movie create an interesting and vivid look into the world of the Seekers and the Souls, but it also includes beautiful shots of the desert and, more importantly, the cave. The giant fields, hot springs, and especially the mirrors on the ceiling were perfect. The glow worms were a nice touch as well.

5. Although physically much different than the seeker is described in the book, Diane Krueger does a great job bringing the relentless, spiteful seeker to life. (If you've read the book, you'll notice one drastic change in characterization toward the end of the film, but again, the fault cannot be placed on the actress, as it was scripted that way.)

I think that the above reasons alone make the film worth watching. However, in the fairness of including a thorough review, I'd also like to point out the limitations.

1. The characterization for certain key characters was a bit off. I mentioned about that I felt there were some limitations with the character of Jared. In the book he is rugged, a bit rough around the edges, but still funny. And he also cares fiercely about Melanie and Jamie. I feel like the movie reduced him to just the boyfriend who fiercely loves Melanie and wants her back; in just watching the movie, you don't get the full effect. The same can also be said of Ian, whose transformation from would-be-murderer to soul-sympathizer comes rather suddenly with little explanation in the movie.

2. At times, the script seems a little stiff. It's not throughout the whole movie, just at certain points, but it still detracts a bit from the story.

To sum up, the movie has a lot more positives than negatives. It is a well-made, compelling movie with a talented cast. I personally believe that the movie will be much more enjoyable if you read the book before watching the film. That way you'll be able to fully appreciate all the characters, even the ones whose personalities are not fully developed in the film. And I also recommend seeing it more than once. It's even better the second time around.",1367020800,7,3805,4.734138972809668
5221066,5,B0090SI4LU,"My current top three directors in no particular order are: Joe Wright, Joseph Kosinski, and Andrew Niccol. All three of them know how to use visuals to tell an amazing story, and harken back to the good-old-days of film-making when it was a craft perfected by great directors. I've been a fan of Andrew Niccols (okay, a raving lunatic fan) ever since I saw GATTACA as a teen and had my mind blown into a million pieces. Since then I've contemplated how much better Truman Show would have been if he directed instead of just wrote the script, I've been deeply encouraged and satisfied with the Bonnie and Clyde masterpiece In Time, and now, in opinion he may have FINALLY cemented the kind of attention he has always deserved (according to one Website I checked prior to this film's release the box office average gross of all of his films combined was a measly 20 million).

GATTACA had amazing cinematography and acting (and a very good musical score), Truman Show had a great concept, and In Time had a an incredible idea and compelling world that made for an incredibly entertaining film. And this film....demands that you buy the Blu Ray as soon as humanly possible.

When I realized that this movie was based on the book by Stephenie Meyer the first time I saw the preview, I was ready to write it off as an afterthought. But as the trailer progressed the same thing happened to me that happened to me when I saw the Tron:Legacy and Pride and Prejudice trailers. The visuals were SO well done, the film looked so well made and excellently crafted, I was instantly made curious. And when I saw that it was written for the screen and directed by Andrew Niccol I was ready to laugh like a madman for joy. This feeling was not misled.

While the fans of the book (which I have not read and am in hurry to do so) may have issues with truncated story, removed characters, condensed plot, etc, I have no such issues. I am watching this film on its own merits. And great merits they are. This film is superbly well directed. The cinematography could be a showcase for you Blu Ray player and plasma TV. Some of the sets look like the director took one look at the best concept art and said ""I don't care how much it costs I want this image EXACTLY on screen and breathed to life."" Between waves of wheat under a ceiling of solar panels, vast desert vistas, and canyon vistas, the scenery on this film is spectacularly filmed. The actors all do a very admirable job with their roles, but the characterizations have a feel that some people may not care for.

I suspect that like me, the director may relate more to the undercurrents and backgrounds of life, and the internal thoughts and emotions of people rather than their outward appearance. What I'm saying is that this film is outwardly awkward and internally subtle, and I think introverts will be drawn to those kinds of characterizations more than other types of people. For others who just read the surface, they will find the characters are much too cool and distant, the romance laughably bad rather than laughably enjoyably good (think Star Wars or Hitchcock romance). And despite the awesome acting on the part of the main character, some people just might get tired of the endless internal monologue. I didn't. But some people might.

As for my point of view, both me and my wife enjoyed the film enormously despite its shortcomings and perhaps a few flaws or holes (mileage will vary on how excusable they are). This is a movie that I can just sit back and enjoy, soaking in the gorgeous visuals and entertaining characters. I'll be picking up the Blu Ray along with Oblivion sooner rather than later. Now if Joe Wright would just make a version of a Tale of Two Cities I could die happy...",1366934400,9,3749,4.556379821958457
5221067,3,B0090SI4LU,"The book is so captivating and it's a beautiful story. The characters evolve slowly, which is what makes the story believable. Given the two hours of film time, there wasn't enough space to portray the unfolding of the relationships and the slow chipping away at the barriers between the Soul and the humans, specifically between Wanda and Melanie. In the film, Wanda's personality was overshadowed by Melanie's. In the book, Wanda was courageous and stubborn in her own way, and she sometimes broke rules (which was considered unheard of in her race) to ensure the survival of those she loved. For example, when she snuck away from the cave with Jared to get medication for Jamie, in the film it came across as if the whole thing was Melanie's idea and Wanda was just a puppet. In the real story, Wanda ALWAYS put her own needs last - to the point where most of the humans were often compelled to defend and save Wanda from herself.

In the book, Melanie's seeker always wore black and she was very obviously in direct conflict with the Souls' way of life. In the film, she actually blended in - they all wore white. In fact, the Souls in the book (with the exception of the Melanie's Seeker) are peace-loving, kind, simple, and unpretentious. In the movie, the blank faces and chrome vehicles made them come across as stoic, ostentatious, and sterile. In the book, the Souls were not actually evil, and Wanda wasn't alone in regretting the takeover of mankind. Their way was to live in harmony with other species, not take them over, and definitely not with violence. There were other souls, such as Fords Deep Waters, who shared her view. In the film, the Souls were just too polished, too slick, and too detached. The plot may not have changed in a major way but the overall pace and feel of the story was drastically different. These changes bothered me not because of the fact that the film didn't mirror the book, but because the overall message of the story got buried in chrome and Lotuses.",1366934400,4,1999,4.630985915492958

5221071,1,B0090SI4LU,"I have to be forgiving, at least slightly, since the book was Meyer's first foray into pop culture. The concept - aliens inhabiting humans in an effort to be peaceful and progressive rather than just annihilating us all - is creative and fresh. The idea that the human mind would remain behind and fight against the invading alien spirit is also pretty clever.

That being said... those are my only compliments.

The book and the movie are equally hokey and cheesy. The teen/college age heroine is so utterly overdone these days, it's beyond tired. The names are painfully corny (Melanie STRYDER? really??) and smack of junior high dreams of authoring a novel ""when I grow up"". The details are poorly thought out (these aliens have the technology to travel through space, but not to find humans hiding out??). The high school bully angst of the guys who dislike Wanderer/It/Melanie in the human colony is so one-dimensional. The gruff yet lovable, Jeff-Bridges-In-True-Grit-Wannabe role played by William Hurt is worthy of a faceplant. The cave set design... oh man, WHO designed this thing? Does anyone else think it even looks remotely like rock? The structure doesn't even attempt to be natural, there are straight walls, perfect corners, flat rock ""benches""... it's like something out of a bad Land Of The Lost remake.

I could go on, but hopefully you already realize what a waste of time this movie is. If you haven't read the book, don't bother, it doesn't redeem the movie at all.",1366761600,5,1488,4.896825396825397
5221072,5,B0090SI4LU,"After I read THE HOST, it became my favorite book forever. Even if the HUNGER GAMES come awefully close, they couldn't top this one. There's no book I've read so many times over and over again, without getting bored or feel a lack of exitement. I love to live in the caves with Melanie and Wanda every single time. So I was more than excited when the movie finally came out.
Of course, it can't completely reach the brillantness of this book, but over all, I'm more than satisfied with how it turned out.
There are changes, sure, some make sense (Seekers wearing white instead of black and using peace instead of glocks), some don't (why do they have to sratch persons out :-( ) and some are simply acceptable (Ian's new hair color and the main Seeker beeing blonde and white). but all in all, I'm more than proud of how the movie came around.
I simply love to share the world I've grown to love in books with people in my life who don't read that much with the help of a movie. The adaption was amazingly close and I'm sooooo glad it didn't turn out to be completely altered like BEAUTIFUL CREATURES, RUBY RED or, even worse the DELIRIUM TV-Series! 5 stars straight out of my heart !:-))",1366675200,9,1188,4.380090497737557
5221073,1,B0090SI4LU,"The Host is the type of movie that every viewer will go into view with an opinion already formed.  Fans of the Stephanie Meyer novel it is based on will go in hoping for a faithful adaption of their beloved story.  And if internet backlash can be believed, a not-insignificant portion will also go in deriding it as the blackest scorch mark on the face of cinema and literature yet seen by mankind.  You already know which group you fall into, and film version of The Host will not change your mind at all.

 For my part, I land firmly in the latter camp of Host-decriers, perhaps not with the same fiery and virulent hatred that some possess, but still pretty firmly put off by the two distressingly long hours of its running time.  It's not a particularly long film, but watching it is a small eternity filled with nothing but unintentionally hilarious melodrama, painfully dull set-pieces, nonsensical plotting, interchangeable characters, passionless romance, and occasional offensiveness.

 Gleefully rubbing salt in the wound is the fact that the opening ten minutes is actually fairly compelling.  Our protagonist Melanie is in a bit of a tight spot, hunted down by mere shells of humans, their bodies controlled by small aliens resembling fuzzy slugs.  If this was the `90's, this would have been an action movie called Animorphs, but these are the teenage years of the 21st century, and we instead get an awkward romance called The Host instead.  Thanks, Hollywood.  Admittedly, it's one with rather high stakes - humanity as we know it is all but gone, with nearly every person alive taken over by aliens.

 Melanie brilliantly escapes by jumping out of a six-story window and putting herself in a coma.  The somber alien-men scoop her up from the crater left in the concrete and slide a new slug-alien into her.  This alien - Wanderer, as she likes to be called - is meant to help find the last of the human resistance using Melanie's remaining memories.  As they soon find out, though, Melanie's mind is not snuffed out like most humans.  She stays around, now effectively a disembodied voice sharing a body with the meek and unemotional Wanderer.

 How exactly this works is never made clear.  The Host has as much internal consistency as an unblended smoothie.  Sometimes Melanie can take control, other times she's completely helpless and unable to even make herself heard.  Melanie eventually tricks Wanderer into leaving the safety of the alien society, and meeting up with the human resistance.  From there on out, the film turns into a romance between Melanie's boyfriend from before her assimilation, and another boy Ian, who falls for the alien in her head.

 And that's it.  I'm going to be honest - no matter what anyone says, as a concept, The Host has an excellent premise.  Besides the huge potential for backstory and setting - it's our own world, run by an entirely different species - the concept of two intelligences sharing the same body could make for some seriously compelling science fiction.  What relation does the intellect have with the body?  Are we only what others see us to be?  Are we all, to some extent, a prisoner in our own minds?

 But no, we'd much rather see some ham-fisted romance, corny dialogue, and senseless plotting.  The larger overarching questions about the fate of humanity are never answered over the film's running time.  Neither is the ""sharing a body"" element ever used in any thought-provoking manner, other than to set up the film's awkward love-quadrilateral.  It's a massive missed opportunity.

  Beyond that, the implications here are seriously problematic.  As Wanderer is gradually accepted into the human resistance group, everyone involved seems remarkably uninterested in the fact that her people have essentially committed genocide on a massive scale.  Not to mention the burgeoning relationship between her and Ian.  It's a fluffy, insubstantial love story that one would expect from a teen movie, where emotion springs from nowhere and passion is a synonym for idiocy.  But factor in the fact that Melanie is watching helplessly as Ian kisses Wanderer with her own body, and what would have been only eye-roll inducing is now borderline sickening.

 Hyperbole is cheap, and The Host has had its fair share directed its way.  But it is, without exaggeration, an embarrassingly bad film.  There simply isn't enough space to list its problems - sets that are completely indistinguishable from each other, lackluster performances, gaping plot-holes, and a shockingly poor grasp of basic science (growing crops in a dormant volcano IN NEW MEXICO) only brush the surface of all that's wrong with it.  Perhaps - as several people have insisted to me - the book is much better.  I would call that damning with faint praise, but by all means, stick with the book and avoid this one like you would a fuzzy white pocket-lint alien slug.",1366588800,8,4904,4.929181929181929

I understand that especially if it's a long intricate story, it's going to look a little different on the big screen. Everyone's perseption and understanding of a story is different. However the spirit of the story and it's characters should still shine through; there should be a definite correlation between movie and book.

I loved Stephenie Meyer's book, The Host. It was a well writen book about an alien race that's main goal and concern is to rid the world of violence and negativity and foster a loving environment. It is a book about learning to walk a mile in someone elses shoes, what it means to love in all of loves different facets, and how to care for others even when others are unkind or even cruel. I was very excited to see the movie because with the exception of Eclipse I loved all of the Twilight movies. However, I was very disappointed!!

The movie was not only rushed but it didn't have any of the depth that the book had! You didn't get to know or appreciate any of the characters, especially Melanie and Wanda. Quite frankly, had I not read the book I would have been confused and bored. I saw the movie with my sister and law and the term she used to describe this movie was, ""lame!"" Even the caves were all wrong. It looked like the characters were living in a jail instead of a cave! What's with the glow worms?! That was not in the book! Where was Walter, Wes, Candy, Jodi, and Sunny? To be honest, I think this book would have been better off left as a book! It's such an intricate story and hard to script for the big screen without mutilating it. I wish I wouldn't have gone to see this movie.",1365897600,,1704,4.321875

The movie doesn't really stay true to characters, not to mention they either change or leave out aspects of the book that are important to both character and story development. To be honest, the only characters that resembled what they were in the books is the main character and Uncle Jeb. I found everyone else to be either lacking or ""completely"" off :(",1365638400,2,481,4.726190476190476
5221087,3,B0090SI4LU,"Like when I read Stephanie Myers' Twilight series, I felt the Host had the potential to be really great but fell short due to the focus being too much on a rather forced romance and not on making a believable and well-rounded story. And just like the Twilight movies, I watched the Host hoping those problems would be corrected and its potential fulfilled. I was disappointed again. Granted, the Host is a much better story than the Twilight series, but there's so much back story that goes unexplained that it's frustrating and there's so little action that it feels like nothing really happens in the couple of hours it runs for. Nothing, I should say, except 2 boys kissing 2 girls who share a body, while the girls fight each other in their minds and Melanie bites and slaps the guy she's apparently madly in love with (he smacks her too so I guess they're even). Well, some other stuff happens too, mainly the Seeker searching for Wanda and some random dramas like 2 guys killing themselves, Kyle trying to kill Wanda and Jamie scratching himself and nearly dying. But it's pretty obvious the love quadrangle was supposed to be the main point of the story. Which is fine, I like a love story as much as anyone else. But the movie needed more. Wanda's other lives and how the invasion happened goes unexplored and there is next to no action between the surviving humans and the souls. In fact this movie has the worst climax I've ever seen. It feels like the Seeker was only used as an excuse to get Wanda/Melanie to the caves and as a reason for Wanda to leave Melanie in the end. Also, the very end of the movie feels completely out of place with the rest. There are other problems with this movie, but I can forgive the chrome paint on the vehicles, the lovely but out of place soundtrack, the ""Store"" and how unrealistically fast the cave people accepted Wanda and Ian fell for her. But not the incredibly stilted dialogue (especially Melanie's slightly overdone VO), the horribly nice aliens who don't mind mass genocide and Wanda being a respected and experienced millennia old body snatcher who is basically outmanoeuvred by a 20 something woman. If you read the book you get a better understanding of Wanda's reasons for her actions but in the movie she comes across as a little too weak. If I'm honest I think it would've been better as a trilogy starting with Melanie's story with the invasion and Jared and then the Host (with more human/soul conflict) and finishing with a movie about humans actively fighting back.  Credit where credit is due Saoirse (I'm sorry if I spelled that wrong) did an amazing job, there were many talented actors in this movie. And honestly it's not an unbearably bad movie despite everything above, but it is seriously lacking in excitement.",1365552000,3,2785,4.649087221095335

I went through the same thing last month after reading through Beautiful Creatures and then watching the movie which was a disappointing shadow of am amazing story. That being said, I really REALLY enjoyed this movie. I don't think I'll be reading the book in this case though. I can appreciate how much everyone enjoyed it but for this once I'll just stick with the movie.

I like to read, almost as much as I love movies. I read the book first, before I knew a movie was coming out.
Remember: The book is quite long. Much of what is in the book is in the movie. Some parts were shortened and preferring to put
in other parts. Yes, there are unknowns and a few recognizeable actors. The uncle for instance is the same guy who was the town leader in The Village.
This book/movie translation is quite close. The books plot drove me to read it and sometimes, sometimes a book to movie adaptation can show how a book might play out visually. I did not expect it to be flooded with special effects as the book wasn't written that way. In my opinion the movie was well done though could've warranted four stars. I might change my view later.

5221090,5,B0090SI4LU,"Pacing
- The pacing was very good for the time restraints it has (800+ page book into 2 hours movie) thing flowed from scene to scene. The emotional flow is about the same as the book with pieces taken out to shorten the film

Action
- There gun fight and chases though they are quick and don last as long we can chalk that up mostly to length. Though there is not as much action and many my have thought. There a still scene intermixed helping the flow of the movie.

Cinematography
- Really nice looking Andrew Niccol does a fabulous Job using wide camera angles to show case the scenery Which is stunning even for a desert. He captures the emotion of character using the camera to show their face and eyes to help show you how the characters are felling.  This was very well done.

Production
- I personally Love the cave scene I feel as though they did a really good job with something of this magnitude (a huge interior living cave system),
-The desert scene are well shot and make you feel lost as if you where in the desert with the characters
-The scene in Louisiana  Are very well shot used many land marks that look and feel Futuristic and metallic.
-This is same look is used for the look of the vehicles, tools and accessories used and it's pulled off very well
- Has flashes of Andrew Niccol's visual style
-Which lead to Costumes, they were great as souls the where a vintage style, as the cave dwellers they look and feel worn in and practical.

Music
- Score throughout the film good - Scored by Antonio Pinto* He does a fabulous job using the score to help convey emotions and help the pacing of the movie flow
-There is also an official soundtrack that has many great artists, and it is very good and worth checking out bit and pieces of this are dispersed throughout the film.

Emotions
- It was touching in a few scenes, but at times I felt it kind of sputtered and never really took off. Andrew Niccol is not an actor's director and I wish he were because (as written below) some scenes the actors could've been directed/pushed more.

Acting
- Solid ... no weak links amongst the actors/actresses who had speaking parts.
- Saoirse was good, She thoroughly pulled off the duel roll of Melanie and Wanda, Which she separated by using different accents Melanie(southern, Wanda proper and soft) And she did very well my only Gripe was that to communicate while preventing confusion was to talk outside(no Voice over) as Wanda and talk inside (using a voice over) as Melanie, and feel it might have been better to keep some of the audiology in her head to better convey that, but that would be hard to do and would be confusing to the audience seeing as it's the same voice.
- Chandler Canterbury Started out rocky his first experience could have been a little better But she is a very good young actor and can show a lot of emotion.
- William Hurt was, in my mind, the standout. I see critics really liking his performance. He was funny when needed and he really was this character.
- Max and Jake were good. They both have a very good presents in the film Jake is able to steel scenes to it balances out with Saoirse
-Boyd and Doc were very good. Though i wish they both got more screen time and character development

The Only issue I have is the fact that it felt kind of rushed. But I have found that the reasoning behind this is That there is no Accurate way of telling how much time is passing. this whole story Took place over several months almost a year, and yet it feels as though it was only days in the movie. There are hint to how much time was really passing, but not enough for people to full understand. I feel if this was fixed then thing would seem like they happen as quickly because the time would have realistically been longer.",1365120000,16,3766,4.376251788268956
5221091,1,B0090SI4LU,"Have you ever seen a TV show or movie about parasitic aliens trying to conquer humanity? If so, did you ever think, ""If only the aliens would realize what special snowflakes humans are! If only humans would realize that parasitic brain-squids that steal unwilling victims' bodies aren't bad!""

Of course you didn't. Nobody with half a brain would.

But Stephenie Meyer did. The result: a soft sci-fi movie called ""The Host,"" which takes a promising idea (what if the body-snatching aliens WON?) and promptly runs it into the ground. Not only is there pretty much no plot to this movie, but it is riddled with flat characters and a total lack of any kind of excitement. Oh, and there's the romanticizing of aliens who steal bodies.

In the not-too-distant future, the Earth has been completely conquered by a race of glowing brain-squids known as Souls (ugh), who possess human bodies. Only a few actual humans are left. When one girl named Melanie Stryder (Saoirse Ronan) is captured by the Seekers, she becomes the new host for a Soul named Wanderer.

Immediately after Wanderer is implanted, a Seeker (Diane Kruger) tries to find out where the other humans are hiding. However, the real Melanie is still there, inside her own head -- and her memories begin to affect Wanderer.

When the Seeker's plans threaten Melanie's life, Wanderer/Melanie escape into the desert in search of Melanie's boyfriend Jared (Max Irons), little brother Jamie (Chandler Canterbury) and the other free humans. However, they aren't too pleased to find a Soul-possessed Melanie in their midst. And even as Wanderer (renamed ""Wanda"") tries to gain their trust, she finds herself falling for someone who isn't Jared.

It's hard to express just how brain-meltingly dull ""The Host"" is. After Melanie escapes from the Seekers, the movie slows to the pace of half-frozen mud and never speeds up again. Occasionally something dramatic will happen -- the Seeker's attack, Jamie's life-threatening injury -- but it's always neatly resolved in just a few minutes.

Instead, most of the movie revolves around a tepid love triangle, and Wanda just hanging around the human compound, harvesting wheat and smooching teen boys. As if the lack of a plot weren't bad enough, we're constantly tortured by Melanie's screeching inner monologue, which tends to break up any moments that could have been quiet.

And really, it wouldn't be a Stephenie Meyer movie unless it romanticized parasitic creatures -- in this case, glowing CGI squids that physically respond to love, peace and kindness. Excuse me while I vomit. Don't expect the movie to address the horrific moral implications of stealing an unwilling victim's body, either -- that would be too deep and intense for a movie like this.

Saoirse Ronan is one of my favorite up-and-coming young actresses, and she does seem to be giving the role her all. But it's a losing battle. Though the movie assures us that Melanie is a rare and special creature with amazing inner strength, she comes across as a bland, utterly typical teen girl with no special qualities whatsoever.

Most of the other actors are completely wasted -- the characters have no development, no history and no motivations. Even the love interests are difficult to tell apart because there's almost nothing to  distinguish them. It makes the whole movie feel drained of any drama, because we don't know these characters enough to care -- when two humans commit suicide to avoid the Seekers, all I could think was, ""Who were they again? Did they even have lines?""

""The Host"" is an utter failure as a sci-fi movie -- it takes a good idea and squanders it on a tepid, sluggish story that never bothers to have a real plot. Thankfully, we probably won't get a sequel.",1365033600,10,3746,4.9379968203497615
5221092,1,B0090SI4LU,"Reason number one this movie failed: They failed at the Melanie/Wanda relationship. This is the heart and the core of the book. If you fail at this, the movie is dead in the water. In the movie Melanie was demanding, harsh and NEVER shuts up. She also in control a lot. In the book that isn't the case. She has an option and when Wanda does something she doesn't agree with she speaks up, but Wanda for the most part ignores her and other then that she stays pretty quite, expect with Jared and Ian. In the book Melanie is feisty and strong willed. Not a total bitch. They also have a strong bond. so when Melanie comes to the conclusion that she wants give her back her body, you not left with the question, ""Why is Melanie fighting this?""

Reason number two the movie has failed: Miscast of the minor characters. I feel like with the exception of Jeb, Melanie/Wanda, Jared and Ian...everyone else was miscast. The worst had to be Doc and Burns

Reason number three this movie failed: The awesome little details were all left out. This movie was rushed. Because it was rush all the little details were left out. The thing the suffered the worst from all these lack of details were the relationships with everyone. Aunt Maggie and Sharon were barley seen, It's hard to understand why Ian fell for Wanda, the relationship between Jared and Wanda is just confusing and Doc is completely left out, so it doesn't make sense when he lies for her later on in the book. Some important characters were also left out. Like Walter, a dying man who becomes Wanda's first real friend, and first real lost and Sunny, another soul who was in Kyle's girlfriends body.

Overall, I'm shocked that Meyer's screwed up her own book into movie so bad. Maybe she should have left this to the pros? I know that there were budget concerns. I agree that THIS is the movie that needed to be spilt up into two movie, NOT BREAKING DAWN. I'm going to say to read the book if you really want to experiences this movie.",1364947200,18,1988,4.456043956043956
5221093,2,B0090SI4LU,"With ""Twilight"" behind her, Stephenie Meyers has moved onto another of her novels that had its film rights snatched up. After the tremendous success of ""Twilight"" it was probably a given that her fortune would continue. ""Twilight"" was more of a phenomenon than a critical success and Meyers seemed to tap into exactly what teen audiences are looking for, a little action, a little fantasy and a whole lot of young males without shirts. Oh, and don't forget love triangles.

""The Host"", to Meyer's credit, is nothing like her ""Twilight"" series. There are no vampires or werewolves, but there are aliens who have, for the most part, taken over the world. If you have seen the movie ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (original, remake or second remake), you get the gist of what kind of aliens we are dealing with, although not near as scary.

Saoirse Ronan plays Melanie/Wanderer/Wanda a girl who leads a resistance with her brother and love interest Jared, played by young hunk Max Irons. When the alien invaders capture her, she's implanted with the soul of one of those aliens and is given a new name, Wanderer. Yet, for some reason Melanie is stronger than most and the two personalities co-exist in the same body. It's all sort of complicated but the jostling that goes on, secretly between Wanderer and Melanie is the most interesting part of the movie. Not to mention, it was a creative and different way for Meyers to insert one of her most important ingredients for success; the love triangle.

""The Host"" is at its core, just a different take on the ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" story line. Instead of death and helplessness, ""The Host"" focuses on hopefulness and handsome teenage boys fighting over two souls in one girl. The bad thing is, I was hoping for a few more death and helplessness moments. Anything would have helped to spruce things up. The movie is slow and uninteresting. The director and writers hoped that the relationship between Melanie/Wanderer and her two men, Ian and Jared, would be enough to suffice, but it isn't. The music score doesn't help much either, but I sure would love to pull that music score, put it to CD and use it for those difficult nights when sleep is troublesome.

Honestly, I think there was some potential with this film, but it would have served better had it been presented as a television mini-series instead of a money making follow up to ""Twilight"". They banked on the fact that those same loyal followers would throw their money in Meyer's direction again, but instead they most likely only hurt the Meyers brand. Plus, had it been a television mini-series, it could have been broken up with commercials and other jazzier programming.",1364860800,9,2695,4.801724137931035

5221125,2,B0090SI4LU,"We're only months removed from the final installment of the Twilight series, and there's already another Stephenie Meyer film adaption hitting the big screen.  Obviously, Twilight has quite the large fan base, bringing in a combined total of more than $3 billion worldwide (not including the books) - so the question becomes:  can the first film adaption from Stephanie Meyer since the end of Twilight achieve even a silver of the same success enjoyed by the Twilight saga?  The term ""success"" is used loosely here, because even though the Twilight films did well at the box office, they're not exactly the most critically acclaimed films.  However, this newest film adaption, The Host, clearly doesn't have the same popularity as Twilight, so expectations should be tampered as far as the box office gross is concerned.

Director Andrew Niccol (The Truman Show & In Time) brings Stephenie Meyer's newest fictional universe to life in The Host, starring Saoirse Ronan as Melanie/The Wanderer (aka Wanda), a member of the human resistance.  Aliens, called ""Souls,"" have invaded the earth and humans are forced to live a life in hiding or risk being mentally possessed by the parasitic life forms.  Melanie, her little brother, Jamie (Chandler Canterbury), and Melanie's lover, Jared (Max Irons), are on the run, but when the aliens find them, Melanie sacrifices herself to protect her brother, and is possessed by a soul called, ""The Wanderer.""  However, unlike other humans that are unable to mentally fight the aliens, Melanie's mind is strong enough to resist.  Now, Melanie and ""The Wanderer"" are forced to share the same mind, both of whom have very different ambitions.  After convincing Melanie's other inner half to meet up with the human resistance (Melanie's family), they must adapt to a life of inner turmoil, while being pursued by other ""souls,"" including ""The Seeker (Diane Kruger),"" - the leader of the anti-resistance.  Jake Able, Frances Fisher, William Hunt, and Boyd Holbrook also star in supporting roles.

For those wondering, The Host is a lot like Twilight - only different.  Yes, that statement is a complete contradiction, but The Host and Twilight are nothing more than role reversal films.  Twilight focuses on two characters, Bella and Edward, whom are destined to be in love for eternity (or at least over the course of five films).  For the duration of the final Twilight films, the vampire ""issues"" play a role in the outcome of their relationship, but the relationship is the ultimate focus.  The premise of The Host focuses more on the alien presence issue and the inner turmoil of Melanie's character, with the intertwined love stories are a secondary plot point.  Instead of a Bella/Edward/Jacob love triangle, The Host features a Melanie/Jared and Wanda/Ian love triangle (foursome if you'd like to get technical about it) - obviously with the two female characters take up the same body.

Now the question becomes:  does this film work as a means of film entertainment?  The short answer is yes, it works.  However, there are a series of soap opera-ish interactions that make the film feel overly drawn out.  In several scenes, Melanie carries on conversations with Wanda, which translate into a bunch of scenes where Saoirse Ronan is talking to herself.  Story-wise, it makes sense - but that still doesn't change the fact that there's too many scenes and too much time devoted to one character talking to one's self.  If she were stranded on a desert island, like Tom Hanks in Cast Away, it would be okay, but this film simply has too many scenes that feel like they could have easily been cut.  For instance, there's a scene where Melanie's personality disappears and the only way to bring her back is for Wanda to make out with two different guys.  Apparently, everyone gets a shot to make out with Saoirse in this lengthy film.

As far as themes go in The Host - and even though they invaded earth - these aliens display admirable traits about the importance of being polite, nonviolent, and caring about one another.  They're all properly dressed in their perfectly white outfits, spotless automobiles, and to boot - they're always trusting, and never tell a lie.  At one point, Wanda even makes a comment that her species trusts one another and they're on earth to eliminate human flaws.  However, even though they obey these traits, that still doesn't stop the film's incredibly weakly written villain, ""The Seeker"" from experimenting with a gun - killing one of her own alien associates in the process.

Overall, this is Saoirse Ronan's film from beginning to end.  However, there's nothing special about the way her character is written, but it's clearly evident that she has a knack for the lead role.  Unfortunately, The Host lacks Twilight's attention-drawing action scenes, causing the film to drag on.  Too much dull banter and a less than memorable love story puts this film squarely in the ""one and done"" column.

Earth has been taken over by a benign, peaceful alien race that occupies the bodies of humans (hosts), squashing the personality / soul of the person who once inhabited the body.  These aliens are, generally, passive and talk slow because that's how we know they are peaceful.

A few human are struggling to hide from the aliens.  I'd like to call them a resistance, but they are far too passive themselves.  They live in the rock formations around Shiprock, New Mexico and sneak ""into town"" for supplies from time to time, but otherwise, they are not really making much of an effort to rid their planet of the invaders.  In a way, this makes sense, because they are so hugely outnumber, but it doesn't make for very good drama.

Into their midst comes Melanie, a tough teen...who unfortunately has been implanted with an alien.  But Melanie is a fighter, and her personality has never disappeared, so she has a constant dialogue with her invader (who comes to be called Wanda).  Most of the drama comes from the fact that Melanie really likes a guy named Jared and Wanda, even though she's an alien, is drawn to Ian.  So we've got this weird ""triangle"" between 3 bodies / 4 souls.

It's possible that some of this COULD have been interesting if told with either a) verve & energy or b) a breezy, light-hearted attitude.  But the movie THE HOST fails its own meager story by moving at a glacial pace in a drably colored world.  The rocks are brown, the costumes are browns and grays and even the crops being grown by the humans consist entirely of brown wheat.  The movie's score is ponderous...and for me to actually repeatedly notice the score, it has to be really good or really dreadful.  Sadly, THE HOST is dreadful...it sounds like public-domain music that would have been labeled ""Acoustic Folk Instrumentals:  Slow & Sad.""

I was simply amazed at how slowly paced the movie was.  Very little happens, but what DOES happen is dragged out seemingly forever.  The very few action sequences there are have no zip.  THE HOST was written by Stephanie Meyers (of TWILIGHT fame), and it's clear the sci-fi trappings are of little interest to her, except as a way to create an awkward love triangle...much like the vampire/werewolf/human stuff she brought us in her more famous series.  But as terrible as the TWILIGHT movies were, they had a sense of humor and touches of tongue-in-cheek playfulness.  THE HOST is so earnest, it is deadly dull.

Melanie/Wanda is played by the interesting young actress Saoirse Ronan (ATONEMENT, HANNA).  In the past, she's turned in some very nice performances.  In this film, she seems trapped by the pacing, and because Wanda the Alien is mostly in charge of her body, she plays most of the film with a look of wide-eyed wonder on her face...but little else.  She hasn't ruined her career here, but she hasn't exactly launched herself into stardom either.  But she fares much better than her two love interests, played by Max Irons and Jake Abel.  Granted, these guys have no real character development...but the two actors invest their roles with NOTHING.  Thus, neither of them has one smidgen of chemistry with Ronan.  Also, Ronan is still clearly a teenager (she's 19 now) and the men are well into their twenties.  Their love scenes feel vaguely icky and inappropriate.

Diane Kruger plays ""The Seeker""...an alien bent on recovering Melanie/Wanda, because she knows how dangerous a combination they are.  The part is also under-written, and Kruger also manages to do little with it.  William Hurt plays the ""leader of the humans""...a man who also happens to be Melanie's uncle.  Hurt tries to infuse his character with some kind of heft, but again, the part is underwritten.

The whole thing feels underwritten and half-baked.  No one feels committed to this film.  Nothing stands out as worthwhile.  Many bad films are at least full of energy, full of the EFFORT (wasted though it may have been) of making the film.  THE HOST feels like the film those same folks would have made...while sleepwalking.",1364774400,4,4186,4.7517337031900135
5221127,2,B0090SI4LU,"""An unseen enemy who can erase your memory."" I HATE it when that happens! Also known as ""La husped,"" this story is based on the novel by Stephanie Meyer (""Twilight"") so this PG-13 film should be a crowd pleaser. My problem was with the 3M dialogue: Murmur; Mutter; and Mumble (I missed 50% of what they said). The screenplay, by Andrew Niccol (""In Time"") who also directed, confused me: I honestly couldn't tell when it was intentionally humorous or just plain laughable. I WILL say our screening audience laughed many, many times.

We start with a young woman so desperate to save her younger brother's life from ""peaceful"" alien invaders she makes a suicidal leap out a window but is soon restored to life by those same despicable beings. From then on, she has the icy blue eyes which tell us that she too, is one of ""them."" Problem is, the survivalist human she replaced has survived...as a pesky voice inside her head. Thus the humor.

I appreciate that all the men in the survivalist community are twenty-ish hunks, each with one good reason or another to be attracted to our heroine. Hey...It's Stephanie Meyer!

Here we have:
  * Saoirse Ronan (""Atonement"") is Melanie/Wanda, both with distinct personalities, vying for control. As Melanie she was in love with Jared, but that doesn't stop Wanda from falling for Ian. Got that straight?
  * Max Irons (""Red Riding Hood"") Yeah! ...Okay, so Jared is another survivalist; he lived with our heroine and her younger brother in a derelict mobile home before the aliens started imposing their peaceful ways on the planet.
  * Jake Abel (""I Am Number Four"") is Ian, who falls for the alien Wanda with poor Melanie shouting her dismay from inside Wanda's head.
  * Chandler Canterbury (""Repo Men"") is indispensable as little brother Jamie who is the first to sort out where the spirit of his missing sister might be lurking.
  * Diane Kruger (""Inglorious Basterds"") is relentless as The Seeker. She WILL capture that missing girl even if she has to resort to violence to do it! (...gasp...)
  * William Hurt (""Robin Hood"" 2010) as Jeb, is the paterfamilias of a group of survivalist wheat farmers. Their field is hidden inside a mountain...trust me. He keeps the peace with a loaded shotgun.
  * Marcus Lyle Brown (Lots of TV) His Healer Fords is the medical man who lives with the survivalists and tries to help our heroine.

At least the aliens are easy to spot: their various means of travel (a Ford Lotus, some motorcycles and a few helicopters) are all bright silver. Expect some gunfire, a little vehicular mayhem, no profanity, no sweaty bodies and no blowie uppie stuff. In addition, this movie passes the Bechdel Test because the women talk about the issues at hand, not about a man.

The message is: ""Love conquers all,"" so look for a happy ending AND a theater with closed captions! (Or wait for the DVD from Amazon.)",1364688000,3,2876,4.738955823293173
5221128,3,B0090SI4LU,"First, let me say, I'm not a ""Twi-hard.""  I don't have any interest in sparkly vampires and ripped werewolves.  And as a heterosexual male who is not a teenager, that's not too surprising.  But I did really love the novel ""the Host.""  For me, the concept is sort of like ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Avatar.""  But instead of having a human run off to live with giant blue smurfs, here we have a protagonist who is truly alien and learns to become human.

I think there are three problems with the film:

1.  The thing that almost sunk the movie for me was the way the character of Melanie Stryder was manifested in Wanda's head.  I didn't mind the use of voice-overs, but I did mind the way that ""Melanie"" came across...sometimes, she sounded like a petulant 14 year-old and not the 20 year-old woman she was in the story.  When Saoirse Ronan was in Wanda mode, I found her mostly more convincing and otherworldly (although near the end, she started sounding like a typical human girl with weird contact lenses in her eyes instead of an alien being that had lived multiple lifetimes in different bodies over a thousand years).

I really do wonder if it would have been a smarter thing to have cast an older actress in the role (perhaps if Jennifer Lawrence had been free she could have done it better).  I think Ronan is a beautiful woman and she's definitely talented as an actress but as I said, when she was in ""jealous Melanie"" mode, she came across as very young...and not particularly likeable.

It also would have been smart to minimize the internal dialogue as much as possible and convey a lot of it with just Ronan's expressions and flashbacks.

2.  The length of the novel (600 pages) really was important to sell the development of the character of Wanda/Wanderer...specifically, how she comes to love being human more than being a Soul and how she developed feelings for the character of Ian and how she also came to love Jared.  But the need to compress the story into something that is movie length (about two hours) resulted in a lot of the ""depth"" of the story falling by the wayside.  For example, we see Ian and Wanda ""fall in love"" but it seems mechanical and formulaic in the movie as opposed to touching as it was in the book.  Perhaps they should have split it into two films.

<spoilers>

Even worse, when Wanda decides she wanted to give Melanie back her body and die, the movie will leave anyone who hasn't read the book scratching their heads as to why she would make a crazy decision like that.  In the book, Meyer set the stage for that intention by showing how much Wanda blamed herself for the death of one of her human friends, Wes, and how guilty she felt over the Souls displacing the human race (which set up the death of another one of her friends, Walt, who is missing from the movie, who died an agonizing death in front of her due to cancer).

<end spoilers>

3.  Another thing that fell by the wayside that was key to the book being so compelling is that it was told by Wanda using ""first person narrative.""  You really got insight into how Wanda was becoming human and how she came to care for the humans she was prisoner of.

This said, the movie was worth seeing and some of the reasons why included:

1.  Saoirse Ronan's ""Wanda"" most of the time did capture the ""alien"" nature of the personality that was in Melanie Stryder's body.

2.  William Hurt did a good job playing Uncle Jeb.  I was a little surprised that Hurt, who I best associate with ""Children of a Lesser God"" and ""the Accidental Tourist"" did so well playing the grizzled Jeb.

3.  The ""world building"" (i.e. bringing the sort of strange post-apocalyptic world of the ""Souls"" to life) was pretty good and really did call to mind what I read in the book. The cave complex was particularly impressive.

4.  Diane Krueger did a good job playing Wanda's pursuer.

<spoilers>

5.  Emily Browning seemed to be well-cast as the new ""host"" for Wanda's personae.

<end spoilers>

So to sum up, I thought ""the Host"" was worth seeing since I loved the novel so much.  I know I will read any sequel Meyer writes, and I probably will watch the movie sequels sort of curiosity to see how they bring any future novels to life.

I figure at the very least, we won't see Saoirse Ronan arguing with herself in those films.",1364601600,173,4308,4.470512820512821
5221129,5,B0090SI4LU,"It's wonderful. Beautiful sweeping views, great cinamtography, very real looking effects. I want to see more of this director's films.

P.S. It's not an octopus",1177459200,,160,5.4
5221130,5,B0090SI4LU,"THE HOST (original Korean title GWOEMUL) is a sneakily good film which was a hit in Cannes. Be aware that it contains an environmental message that isn't exactly subliminal and that, also, it shows the U.S. in a very dim light. Nevertheless, I easily got past all that and was soon very immersed in the movie. I really don't know how this film got past my movie radar, but thank goodness it did. I went into this not knowing much about it other than it was ostensibly a creature feature. But it's so much more than that. THE HOST manages to integrate a strong family theme, an off the wall sense of fun, and an unpredictable, heartbreaking storyline which kept me on the edge of my seat. I truly did not know what would happen next, and that's a very good thing. As a bonus, this movie is also pretty funny.

It starts out in a U.S. Army Base morgue in Korea when an American lab technician has his lackey dump formaldehyde down the laboratory drains even though he knows that the toxic stuff will eventually flow into the Han River. Some years later, frequenters on the banks of the Han River witness a grotesque monstrosity shockingly emerge from the river and begin an all out rampage. Survivors of the attack are summarily rounded up by the government which, fearing a creature-initiated virus, then institutes a quarantine and hastily begins conducting tests on the parties involved.

One particularly contentious family is very much involved in the doings. Held under quarantine, they are grieving the death of a 13-year-old girl named Hyum-seo, who was seen being carried away by the monster. Her father, the dim-witted Gang-du, receives a call on a cell from someone claiming to be Hyum-seo and that she's alive but being held captive in a hole under a bridge. Gang-du and his kin break away from quarantine and flee into the sewer system and begin their search for Hyum-seo.

Meanwhile, time is running out for the girl Hyum-seo. With lack of food and drink and imprisoned in a deep chasm, she glimpses no prospects for the future as she awaits her turn to become nourishment for the creature. A further burden is laid on her shoulders when another survivor, this time a little boy, appears. At last, with hope dwindling faster and faster, she seizes on one opportunity for escape.

Yes, the star of the film is the beastie itself. But THE HOST focuses more on the quarrelling family members than on the monster, and this works to the film's advantage as we get the chance to know the characters and invest in what happens to them. The dysfunction in this family is never more strongly portrayed than in an early scene where they remain hilariously combative even as they mourn the supposed death of young Hyum-seo. This film goes on to underline the power of kinship and how familial loyalties can overcome personal differences.

The monster is part squid, part tadpole, and part f*ck-all. It shows up sporadically, which serves to heighten the suspense and enhance its effectiveness. Its debut appearance is a freakin' doozy, done in broad daylight with its raging man attack taking place out in the open. The sequence carried a surreal note as I just wasn't used to these kinds of perfidy not occuring in the depths of night and in enclosed spaces. The monster, when it does have screen time, gallumps prodigiously, its pace denoting an intensity and a certain inevitability. There's a fluid grace and ease in the manner it transports itself across the various bridge undercarriages and the dexterity in which it scales sleek walls. It's darn impressive and mostly convincing. So, well done to the film's CG department.

THE HOST sows a lot of seeds: it subverts the monster horror genre and remains mostly unpredictable. Every so often it'll unleash moments of wicked slapstick humor and, later on, sober us up with scenes of utter poignancy. Oh, yes, it also calls out the U.S. military (Agent Yellow? I could see it). The scenes with the monster are pretty darn spectacular. When watching THE HOST, be prepared to be unsettled and invigorated. You might even end up feeling sad. Be that as it may, THE HOST gets five formaldehyde-polluted stars from me.",1177200000,,4168,4.765927977839335
5221131,4,B0090SI4LU,"Pay no mind to the countless comparisons to ""Jaws"", ""Alien"", and the rest of the monster classics that a quality film like this always draws.  This one stands on its own as an original mix of harsh political commentary, family drama, black comedy, and horror.  The metaphor for the hysteria over the asian SARS epidemic is thick and the accusatory tone towards America's interventionist ways and the alarmist media's sensationalism is thicker.  But don't think this is some heavy-handed self-serving political film that wallows in its own symbolism; this film is about the importance of family pulling together and taking care of each other when noone else will.  Oh yes, and there's a monster in there somewhere too.  I'm going to drop a few minor spoilers now so if you want to go in completely cold and experience the full thrill I received viewing this movie you might want to go watch the film now.  Alright, on with the content review.  Let me put it this way, I got my money's worth in the first 20 minutes of the film.  The sudden appearance of the beast breaks the most entrenched of monster movie standards: the slow reveal.  The almost complete lack of buildup shocked me as the monster came charging out of the background in its high-velocity and unsettlingly awkward gait with ferocious momentum sending humanity flying left and right.  What follows is one of the greatest rampage sequences ever seen by human eyes.  I was absolutely thrilled by it and only the most jaded of film fans could feel otherwise.  In fact, aside from a few gaping plot holes, my only real complaint about this movie is that it climaxes so soon.  That's not to say the rest of the film isn't good, but it never reaches that fever pitch again.  As the trigger-happy government declares quarantine and almost immediately begins asserting it's will on the victims -even as they still mourn their lost family members- the media spreads word of a deadly and highly contagious virus that the creature is carrying (hence, ""the host"").  But as the film progresses, we see no evidence of any abnormal sickness, just the paranoia of the people in reaction to the media's hysterics and government's jumping to conclusions.  As our protagonists, the Park family, search for their little girl (Hyun-seo, taken to the monster's den for later consumption) we come to see that when the government is incompetent and overbearing and the general populace is collectively terrified of the guy standing next to them the only things you can rely on are your own family and what you can see and do for yourself.  The ne'er-do-well Park family consists of Hyun-seo's father, a slow-witted narcoleptic, her aunt who's a professional archer with a penchant for choking under pressure, a college-educated uncle with a hot temper who can't hold a job, and a caring grandfather who holds them all together.  The dysfunction of the family is humorous to watch, but the devotion they all share in the search for the little girl is touching; and that's the real heart and soul of this film.  The monster is menacing, the government is corrupt, the Americans are comically over-the-top self-serving jerks, the populace at large are terrified for all the wrong reasons, and the only real disease is the paranoia spread by the media but the Park family's struggle is the real story here and it's a great one.",1177113600,,3364,4.829268292682927
5221132,3,B0090SI4LU,"""The Host"" is a South Korean monster film. And I'll state up front that I am not really into monster flicks. I like suspense, thriller and horror when it comes to these types of genre films, however, the primary reason for my purchasing the film was because of actor Kang-ho Song, who gave a gritty portrayal in his role of the bereaved father in Park's ""Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance."" However, I like quite a lot of Kang-ho Song's films, and I believe that he is a very great actor, no matter what role he is portraying. Also, I believe that no matter what the failings of this film, he gave a very good acting performance in this film. As did many others. Moreover, for those who like monster films, I can see where this film may appeal to you, and would probably merit a 4 to 5 star rating.

Kang-ho Song's character in the film reminded me a little bit of Takashi Kitano in his role as Zatoichi [""Blind Swordsman""] due to his blonde hair. Also, I couldn't help being reminded of the film ""Tremors"" while viewing the film, even though there are many differences. Part of this for me was that the film had some pretty funny scenes in the beginning, middle and ending of the film. In particular were the at times humorous and funny interactions of the family members who are trying to locate the missing child of Song. I don't wish to give out too many spoilers in the film, or give another rehash of the plot. However, for me the film was definitely a family-centered film, where the creature takes a backseat: But not too far back!

The film does have some suspenseful moments, especially at the beginning while the specatators are leisurely relaxing on the banks of the Han River. And I must admit, the film takes off pretty quickly in the beginning. There are scenes that really pull you into the film at the start. And although I did not think that this was a great film, it was not a failure by any means. It was an enjoyable film to watch. However, I would recommend that viewers rent the film first to see if it is your type of film. The film does not takes itself too seriously--especially when you watch the family, before, during and after the search for the abducted child. I thought the film was going to be more serious, however, it was still an enjoyable watch. Not great, but watchable. The film is average, to above average. More importantly, however, is that it is a fun watch. Recommend that you rent it first before purchasing. [Stars: 3.5]",1176854400,,2459,4.474387527839643

WHY YOU SHOULD SEE IT.

* There is real character development. You may not like them but there is development.

* The team of heros don't all survive.

* The team of heros don't really like one another that well.  Dysfunction is fun.

* The heros get widly separated and belieably brought back into the key moment.

* The victim the heros are after has a compelling little story in the beasts lair.

* The wide angle running escape scene after the brain tap was fun to watch. I reminded me of a fight scene in Old Boy.

* Its probably better to watch it on DVD because as you will see below I assume the Korean version had a few extra scenes.

* This director has a weird eye and is coming from a different angle and after making Old Boy and a less wonderful but solid Sympathy for Mr. Vengence you gotta give him credit for trying something totally different.

WHY YOU MAY NOT LOVE IT.

A) There are scenes that don't make sense: The pouring out of the formaldhyde for failing to dust a military morgue somehow leads to a mutation a few years later but there is no scene of direct linkage just arbitrary blame.  You also don't know why the doctor is such a good as to dump probably a hundred gallons of formaldhyde down the sink just cause there is dust on it. In addition there appears to be a missing scene between the brother getting hit in the head with a bottle by one character and then suddenly being in a car with that character and a man in surgical scrubs while making molotov coctails in the back seat.  They also never develop that guy who hits him with the bottle and all of a sudden he is helping make coctails, and later pouring gas on something at a crucial moment.

B) Several very anti american scenes and oddly subservient doctors, politicians and military Koreans.  Lots of radio and TV broadcasts about the Americans and WHO and other organizations criticizing Korea for its failure to capture the ""virus"" carriers and governmental acquiescence to let them come in and do something.

C) The cheesy end scene where a weirdly shaped egg like thing on a crane is going to drop agent yellow to kill all viruses in the area. One crane was going to drop some yellow smoke that would cover the area for 12 kilometers around.  It made no sense.",1175904000,,2335,4.378190255220417
