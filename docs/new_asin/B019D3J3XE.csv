8744790,1,B019D3J3XE,Waste of time and money....thought this was a preppers dvd with loads of info...was I wrong. Should have the one review....first disc....conspiracy theory about 911....then 10 minutes on freezes dried food...then a half hour of trailers. The 2nd disc even worst...garbage.,1462579200,,272,5.658536585365853
