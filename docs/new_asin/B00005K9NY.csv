This is what happens.  The majins Supopo and Kibit etc.. try to capture some of Gohans energy and place it in Buu so he can be awakened.  But not if Videl has anything to say about it.",990576000,2,280,3.982142857142857
7942811,5,B00005K9NY,"I've owned movies with episodes of Dragon Ball Z in my past and now. But, this is one near perfect. It has a great storyline, good action, humor, and you pretty much get the whole story of the character Spopovich. Well anyway, here is the summery:

Videl's fight with Spopovich begins. She seems to have the upper hand in this bout, but every time she knocks him down, he gets back up, even when it seems impossible. As the fight continues, Spopovich begins to take the upper hand. To counter, Videl deals him a ferocious kick to the head. This kick turns Spopovich's head all the way around! Although it seems like he is dead, he suddenly gets back up and straightens his head out. Meanwhile, Shin reveals to Piccolo that he is the Supreme Kai. He gives him no more details, but tells Piccolo to keep it a secret. While the match continues, Spopovich starts wailing on Videl, and there's nothing she can do about it. When it seems like he is about to deal out her final blow, Gohan decides that he's seen too much, and goes out to rescue her. Suddenly Yamu, Spopovich's partner, tells him to stop punishing Videl and to finish the match. Spopovich tosses her out of the ring, and he and Yamu leave for the moment. With Videl badly injured, Goku goes to get some senzu beans from Korin. Later, Gohan is waiting anxiously for Goku to return with the senzu beans. Finally, the hero arrives, and Gohan takes a bean to Videl, who heals instantly. Gohan and Kibito start their match, but no punches are thrown. Kibito asks to see Gohan's Super Saiyan power, and Piccolo tells Gohan to show him. Piccolo informs the others that Shin is the Supreme Kai, who then informs the Z Fighters not to intervene if anything happens to Gohan. Gohan begins to power up. Once, Gohan fully powers up, and just as Supreme Kai predicted, Spopovich and Yamu suddenly attack him. They stick a weird device inside him, steal all of his energy, and then leave. Supreme Kai takes off after them, and Goku, Piccolo, Krillin, and Vegeta follow. Kibito heals Gohan, and those two and Videl also leave. Supreme Kai explains that long ago there was a wizard named Bibidi who created a monster with unbelievable destructive power. Supreme Kai killed Bibidi, and the monster, Majin Buu, was left sealed in a ball. Now Bibidi's son, Babidi, has come to resurrect the monster, and they plan to use Gohan's stolen energy to do it.

To be quite honest, this DVD really feels like an actual movie. Although, Spopovich is not as much fun as big guys in Dragon Ball Z like Broly, Recoome, Super Android 13, Super Garlic Jr., or even Nappa, but he is interesting in a few ways. So, if you're looking for a good Dragon Ball Z movie that is built with episodes, please buy this one. It's a must buy for all Dragon Ball Z fans!",1463270400,,2782,4.5069306930693065

7942813,4,B00005K9NY,"If you hate Videl, or are just mad at her for how big of a jerk she was in the Saiyaman saga, then this is the video for you! Videl gets the absoulet snot beaten out of her! {of course all it takes is a senzu bean to make her feel better} Spopovitch's beating of Videl truly is brutal. {on the other hand if I had my neck torqued around I'd be mad too} I think it would have been better if Gohan had stopped Spopovitch instead of Yamu, but then they would have found out about him being the gold fighter. the funniest part about this video is when Sharpner and Erasa find out about gohan being both The Great Saiyaman AND The Gold Fighter, Erasa stutters ""boy... he sure is.. talented, huh?"" Hilaerus! and also ChiChi wants so bad for gohan to become a scholer as we all know, but how she cheers him on when he is about fight is very funny! Videls reaction to gohan being The GF is off because she suspected it in ""Blackmail."" The emotion between Gohan and Videl is good too. the reason it gets four stars is because there is almost no action in the second part.
but I give it four and a half stars.",1017446400,,1099,4.116279069767442
7942814,5,B00005K9NY,"The uncut version of these four episodes are pretty good. I personally didn't mind the edited version myself. Videl's beating from Spopovitch is just down right brutal. If you've the edited version that's pretty bad already, but in this version you get to see even more blood. I got it give to Videl though. What she lacks in strength she makes up for in courage and warrior's spirit (or maybe it's just stupidity).",1016150400,2,415,4.698630136986301
7942815,3,B00005K9NY,"This DVD is mainly Videl fighting Spopovich.  Then towards the end it's Gohan's turn to fight Kibito.  Spopovich and Yamu steal Gohan's energy and fly away.  The Z fighters, the Supreme Kai and Kibito fly after them them.  Supreme Kai and Kibito explain to the Z fighters who Babidi is and about resurrecting Majin Buu.  The menu is animated and there are lots of options.",1006387200,,372,4.661538461538462

7942817,5,B00005K9NY,"If you've collected any of the early DBZ DVD's and were as dissapointed as I was, here's a nice change. Finally Funimation is including Japanese and English versions on the same DVD and running them as individual episodes instead of the hour long ""mini-movie"" versions the first several DVD's were released in. I've been watching the Japanese versions since before the DVD's came out and I personally LIKE the dubbed version. The music is better and, at least in this DVD, there aren't any cuts. The VHS's of the same episodes are similar to the Cartoon Network version. You'll find this DVD, in both languages, call Mr. Satan by his name instead of Hercule. The VHS has SATAN scrubbed from all the building and vehicles. This is veiwable in Japanese WITH the Japanese titles and credits OR in English with English titles and credits. BLACKOUT actually has 4 episodes instead of 3, allowing it to end with a little more closure than it would have had at the end of the third episode.
The ""Great Sayaiman Saga"" leading up to the episodes included here will begin their run on Cartoon Network in mid-September 2001, but they are likely to seem like a completely different show by the time CN finishes their chopping. I recommend this if you are true DBZ fan!",1000080000,4,1256,4.6877828054298645
