2224463,3,B0007OP0U4,"The characters were taken from the radio show which ran from 1937-1952. The main characters Steve Wilson (Philip Reed) and Lorelei  Kilbourne (Hillary Brooke) seem to be a good match, although this is still a 'B' movie. Put Pine-Thomas in the same category as Monogram and PRC so things such as sets are of little importance. The plot is more than passable in fact I was fooled in the beginning what role Susan, the the niece of the publisher was up to. Since this film is in public domain the copy that prime amazon received was good quality. This couple who are like Mr. and Mrs. North or the Thin Man series is well worth an hour of your time",1481932800,,645,4.375
2224464,4,B0007OP0U4,"""Yah, his watch got stolen"" is the newsroom reply in BIG TOWN AFTER DARK (1947), which is of course inaccurate. In Hecht/McArthur's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-FRONT-PAGE/dp/B00005J75B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE FRONT PAGE</a>&nbsp;(1931), Editor Walter Burns gave Hildy a going-away present, his watch, then called the cops to report Johnson had stolen it. Small matter. As in that story though, here the ace reporter is quitting and the paper's editor seeks ways to keep the departure from occurring.

This adaptation of the radio show ""Big Town"" was scripted in part by that show's writers, Daniel Mainwaring and Maxwell Shane. PARAMOUNT's second unit team lends a fine late-40s look to this spare crime drama. Ann Gillis as Susan Peabody, a girl whose face belongs on an iodine bottle (according to the story), plays a not-so-innocent 20-year-old college dropout quite well. Hillary Brooke as crime reporter Lorelei Kilbourne is cultivating the haughtiness she brought to full flower in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-ABBOTT-COSTELLO-SHOW/dp/B00316DDZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE ABBOTT & COSTELLO SHOW</a>. Phillip Reed, starring in his second of three ""Big Town"" programmers, is competently handsome as Illustrated Press editor Steve Wilson.

The picture falls short in two areas. Comic relief Vince Barnett as Hillary's snoop fails to amuse, and the two action sequences are spoiled by staginess. These are not enough however to make this an ill-spent hour. The costumes, cars, settings, atmosphere and fast-moving plot make ""Big Town After Dark"" a satisfying cinematic snack. Recommended.

2224465,4,B0007OP0U4,"Big Town After Dark, 1947 film

The film starts with a card table and poker chips. Next there is a view of tall buildings in a big city (New York?). Reporter Lorelei has sold her first novel and quits her job. The publisher has a niece who wants the job of crime reporter. Editor Steve Wilson doesn't want a cub reporter, but changes his mind when he sees Susan. There is a tall square building (the Hall of Justice?). Lorelei will train her successor. Who is following Susan? Susan knows how to play poker. [The poker clubs suggest California.] Should they be banned within ten miles of colleges? [No, that is not a good reason.] Lorelei and Steve visit that poker club and learn what's going on. Was someone dealing from the bottom of the deck? Who took Susan?

The stock sale is a cover for the $50,000 ransom of Susan. The police bring in Chuck LaRue and hold him on an open charge. [No habeas corpus?] Then Susan walks into the Press Room. Can Peabody recover his $50,000? One source suggests Susan isn't that innocent. Steve uses that stock to gain access to that poker club. Lorelei checks up on Susan. Later we learn more about the true character of Susan - and her husband! Chuck LaRue calls Steve and they play poker in Susan's apartment. There is drama in the final showdown and a shooting. The arrival of Louie saves Steve. And so there is a happy ending.

This is based on a radio program. This has a complex plot with unexpected surprises to interest and entertain viewers. The ending seems forced to clean up the loose ends. It shows the politics of newspaper ownership.",1264809600,,1585,4.515679442508711
2224466,4,B0007OP0U4,"""Big Town"", a shallowly disguised New York City, is of importance in a number of modes for popular United States culture, initially being a radio programme from 1937 until 1962, then on to television episodes, 1952/1956, and eventually as a comic book series, 1956/1958, with the protagonist in each manifestation being Steve Wilson, originally a reporter working for the Big Town Illustrated Press, later becoming its editor-in-chief, and played in this, the third of four films based upon the radio show, by Philip Reed who is featured in all of the four.  In the production here, Wilson's almost girl friend and ace crime reporter Lorelei Kilbourne (Hillary Brooke), after her first novel has been accepted for publication, gives him two weeks notice of her resignation from her newspaper position but, to her chagrin, she is almost immediately replaced by the Illustrated Press owner's niece Susan (Anne Gillis), who by appearances also wedges herself into Steve's affections, although in reality he is using her to discover information of crooked Big Town activity involving an illegal gambling ring that preys upon college students.  Susan is possibly not what she appears to be, and while Steve explores the girl's connection with local gambling kingpin Chuck LaRue (Richard Travis), owner of the Winners' Club, a night spot for gambling that is near to the campus where Susan attends, Lorelei also investigates her new rival's activities, with her efforts yielding more than she has expected, as all three of them may be in serious peril from the Forces of Evil.  This is better than a routine ""B"" programmer, as it provides some incisive and hardbitten dialogue, a clever subtext based upon poker playing, and a generally edgy quality pervading the characterizations that lifts the work above the norm and, in spite of budget restrictions that rule out retakes, and a necessity for filling demands of its melodrama genre, there is plenty of ""business"" for a viewer to enjoy.  Reed and Brooke make an elegant and worldly pair, veteran charcter players William Haade and Joe Sawyer perform as LaRue henchmen, and Vince Barnett has a substantial part in this Pine/Thomas production with producer William Thomas also directing and capably utilizing a crisply composed Whitman Chambers script in an always interesting, skillfully edited, briskly paced and well-cast film that additionally includes an effective original score by Darrell Calker, Gotham flavoured, of course, although the extensive location shooting is along Normandie Avenue on the east side of Hollywood.",1133222400,11,2575,5.273170731707317
