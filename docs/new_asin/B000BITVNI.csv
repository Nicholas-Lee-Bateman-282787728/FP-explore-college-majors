2418712,1,B000BITVNI,"I recently watched this PPV and I still don't get TNA. Its like a bunch of former WCW stars got together after being let go by WWE and started TNA. Jarrett is the Triple H of the company and always held onto the title in the early days, giving it up a few times for a short period of time. Scott Hall was in bad shape and should of even wrestled in the match. The early days of TNA was like trying to revive WCW. They had Vince Russo, Mike Tenay, DDP, Raven, Randy Savage, Dustin Rhodes, and other various stars past there prime. Expect Raven, who is still fun to watch but sad to see the shape he is in circa 2007. The X-Divison kept the company afloat and the hardcore matches with Abyss, Raven, and Jeff Hardy were also fun to watch. TNA is a great company and has a bright future.",1132272000,5,784,4.097402597402597

2418718,5,B000BITVNI,"I happened to watch an episode of TNA Impact when it was on Fox Sports Net at the time and they were advertising their pay-per-view Final Resolution.  I ordered Final Resolution and it was a great pay-per-view.  I haven't seen it in a while, but I highly recommend this dvd for any TNA Wrestling fan, especially for the Ultimate X match and the Tag Team title match.  After I watched this show, it made me realize how good the TNA ppvs are and how the WWE ppvs just aren't worth my money anymore.  Order it and I know you won't be disappointed.",1128124800,,544,4.303921568627451
2418739,4,B000BITVNI,"Final Resolution 2007 started, ended, & continued some of the rivalries in 2007. It was a pretty solid opening ppv, there wasn't really a dud or a bad match on the card which made it a pretty awesome event.

1. Last Man Standing Match
Rhino vs. AJ Styles
A pretty solid opener. Not really like a weapons fest, they just really beat each other down until one of them couldn't stand anymore. It had a cheap ending but the after match assault and the table spot added more to the match. Good opener. 4/5

2. X-Division Championship
Chris Sabin vs. Christopher Daniels vs. Jerry Lynn
I was very impressed with this so called ""past, present, & future match."" There were some good moves executed, some good wrestling as well. Pretty good triple threat. 4.5/5

3. PCS Finals
Austin Starr vs. Alex Shelly
This was a good match as well, but it had a 10 mintue time limit so it ended in going to a sudden death. Very good x-division match up. I really enjoyed the after match segment with Bob Backlund. 4/5

4. ""Cowboy"" James Storm w/ Gail Kim vs. Petey Williams
This match was pretty good as well. Some nice offensive moves used with some good counters as well. Also the Storm/Miss Jackie relationship started here with Gail Kim getting pushed to the side. Pretty good match. 4/5

Now heres the segment with the Voodo Kin Mafia declaring the winners of their rivalry with Vince McMahon. I really enjoyed this segment, VKM talks how the new Degeneration-X was crap and just stupid but it is ironic how indeed Triple H & Shawn never got back together after this ppv was hired & I know Triple H go hurt before hand, but they never did got back together when he returned at Summer Slam so I guess what VKM said got through Vince's head. Pretty good segment to check out. But of course Vince wouldn't even acknowledge this.

5. NWA Tag Team Championship
Team 3D vs. Latin American Xchange
Pretty good tag match. Some pretty good tag moves were executed by both teams. Some good outside ring action as well. Cheap ending with Team 3D getting dqed because of Brother Runt. Good match though. 3.5/5

6. 30 Minute Ironman Match
Kurt Angle vs. Samoa Joe
Joe & Angle puts on another greaty match up. I really enjoyed Angle during this time early in his TNA career. Some great moves, good submissions, just some good everything. The decisions came at good times too. This was a great match, match of the night for me. 5/5

7. Triple Treat Elimination Match for the NWA World Championship
Sting vs. Abyss vs. Christian Cage
Not the best triple threat. The match was here so they can continue the Sting/Abyss rivalry instead of crowning a new champion in Christian. Decent match up. Some pretty good outside ring action. Nice triple threat though overall. 4/5

Final Resolution was a pretty good event. If yall have any spare cash around I recommend checking this one out.",1216425600,4,2849,4.581532416502947
2418740,4,B000BITVNI,"I was really excited to watch this TNA PPV. The matches were top notch and the main event looked pretty good. Aside from the Iron Man match between Joe and Angle and the main event, the card was decent at best. Rhino VS AJ Styles started the show strong, but the ending was stupid. Im trying to enjoy TNA but have a hard time for some reason. I watch early TNA and its like watching a WCW event back before they closed and TNA now is basically a company ready to rocket to fame with former WWE stars at the helm. I love Sting, Christian Cage, and Kurt Angle but TNA needs to stop there. Half of the rooster is now former WWE stars and the once bright stars of TNA like Styles and The Fallen Angel have taken a back seat to the new guys. Samoa Joe and Abyss are used alot but fall victim to the former WWE stars to many times. Anther part of this PPV I didn't enjoy was the VKM attack on WWE. Im all for free speech and a war between these two companys, but that angle felt like it was out dated by almost ten years. Luckily the company didn't really go much further with the angle after this PPV. TNA fans will already own this dvd but I do recommend this to fans of WWE who have yet to buy into TNA. I made the mistake of never watching WCW and always supported WWE. Now I like TNA and WWE equally.

On a side note, why is TNA main events so short? WWE seems to have a main event that last at least 20-30 minutes depending on the match and TNA seems to do a main event in under 20 minutes. I don't know why.",1186617600,2,1508,3.9768976897689767

1. The 3Live Kru vs. The Fallen Angel Christopher Daniels, Matt Bentley, Kazarian- This was a decent way to kick off the show. I really liked the factor that Daniels added to the match and that was his experience and speed. It was just a normal tag team match with just some solid wrestling and some high flying action. Decent match. Winner The 3Live Kru. Match Rating 6/10.
2. Elix Skipper vs. Sonjay Dutt- This was a very good X-Division match. Those two worked really well together with Sonjays speed and Skippers power and speed. This had just a lot of high flying and fast paced moves and it flowed really well. Winner Elix Skipper. Match Rating 7.5/10.
3. Dustin Rhodes vs. Kid Kash- This was a different match. I have never been a fan of Dustin Rhodes or (Goldust). I just thought that Kid Kash would have been a better fit to wrestle someone in a X-Division match cause this match did not flow well. I also thought that Kash worked way to much on the leg of Rhodes which made it slow and boring. Worth one watch but than you can skip this one. Winner Dustin Rhodes. Match Rating 5/10.
4. Raven vs. Erik Watts- This was another okay match. I really liked this match because it had quite a few hardcore spots with the use of a chair and the steel steps it just fit with Ravens style match a lot more. Not a bad match and some good aftermath after the match between Raven and Watts. Winner Erik Watts. Match Rating 7/10.
5. Jeff Hardy vs. Scott Hall Special Referee Rowdy Roddy Piper Falls Count Anywere Match- I have so many problems with this match. First off when I bought this dvd it said a falls count anywere match which means weapons are allowed. Well not only did they not have any weapons Piper took them away from hall before the match as if they were illegal so the dvd was misleading. Second off these two had a preatty good fued going into this match with hall coasting Hardy the title a couple ppv's ago. This was only a five minute match and seemed like a through away match. Skip this one. Winner Jeff Hardy. Match Rating 2/10.
6. DDP vs. Kevin Nash vs. Monty Brown Last Man Standing for a shot at the NWA World Title- This was a decent match. The rules were it was an elimination match were you could be eliminated by pinfall or getting thrown over the top rope. Nash got eliminated pretty quick by DDP throwing him over the top rope. A pretty good match between DDP and Brown but if a little better would have been better. Brown hit the pounce and got the win. Winner Monty Brown. Match Rating 6/10.
7. Team Canada vs. Americas Most Wanted for the NWA World Tag Team Titles- Now we get to the second disk of this dvd and finally we get some really good matches. Going into this match I did not know what to expect but this match did not disappoint. You can not get much better tag team wrestling than this. Eric young and Robert Roode showed that they can hang with the best. There were tons of false finishes that will keep you on the Edge of your seat. Great match. Winner and new NWA Tag Team Champs Americas Most Wanted. Match Rating 9/10.
8. Petey Williams vs. A.J. Styles vs. Chris Sabin Ultimate X Match for the X-Division Title- So we go from one great match to another great one. This match is off the hook. This is proboly the best Ultimate X Match I have ever seen. There were so many high flying moves. Sabin even hit a hurricanran on Styles from the top of the cable. I will let you see all the nice moves this match is off the chain. Winner and new X-Division Champ A.J. Styles. Match Rating 10/10.
9. Jeff Jarret vs. Monty Brown for the NWA World Heavyweight Title- This was another good match. Not as good as the last two but a very good main event. This match basically played the role of Brown who would not give up no matter what cause it was his dream to become NWA Champ. There was tons of nice action including lots of chair shots and guitar shots and tons of near falls. Great main event. Winner Jeff Jarret. Match Rating 8.5/10.

Well that raps up another. I would give TNA Final Resolution 2005 a grade of 61/90 which is a 68% which means this is a good DVD. I will say this much that this is a DVD you should pick up but mainly for the second disk as there are 3 good and great matches.

First off i am a big abyss fan but his title run was bad basicly because it was overshadowed by samoa joe vs kurt angle and a bad storyline any way this match was alot better than the one at turning point very good match 8/10

2418744,5,B000BITVNI,"This my friends is TNA's 1st PPV of 2005, and let me just say that this is BETTER than WWE's New Year's Revolution 2005.

I mean Final Resolution had better matches than NYR.

3LK vs. Fallen Angel, Bentley and Kazarian
A GREAT way to open up the show, @ the end The Truth w/the Axe Kick for the wai for the 3LK.

Primetime vs. Sonjay Dutt
This was AWESOME!
Primetime and Sonjay Dutt are arguably the 2 greatest athletes never to hold an X Division Belt, and of course Primetime a former WCW CW Tag Team Champion. I give this one 5 Stars.

Dustin Rhodes vs. Kid Kash
This matches was a no brainer, Dustin Rhodes put K-I-D in his place.

Raven vs. Erik Watts
This match was awesome, by 2 former WCW Wrestlers, but it was Watts who got the victory.

Jeff Hardy vs. Scott Hall w/Roddy Piper as referee.
Jeff Hardy finally gets revenge on Scott Hall and it also started a rivalry between him and the monster Abyss.

Then you had the Triple Threat Elimination Match w/Monty Brown coing off w/a win and a shot @ the NWA World Gold.

AMW vs. Team Canada
Now THIS was AWESOME!
A great effort by these 2 Tag Teams, I loved it when AMW put the cuffs on Scott D'Amore, and when Johnny Devine hit his teammate w/the chair it allowed AMW to win the NWA World Tag Team Titles for the 6th time as title holders 5th time as a Tag Team, amazing match.

A.J. Styles vs. Petey Willams vs. Chris Sabin Ultimate X Match for the X Division Title Belt
Amazing Match, that was my 1st time ever seeing an Ultimate X Match on a PPV when I bought the DVD, I was SO glad when Scott D'Amore got put out of the arena, they had amazing moves, but it was Styles @ the end to regain the X Division Gold for a 5th time.

Jeff Jarrett vs. The Alpha Male for the NWA World Heavyweight Belt
A great Main Event, but it was Jeff Jarrett who emerged victorious and retained the NWA Heavyweight Gold, I felt bad for Monty Brown, I know he worked so hard, but I hope that he does get the World Title again.

Now THIS is what you call PRO WRESTLING and not SPORTS ENTERTAINMENT.

This DVD is a Must Have and it also has bonus footages as well that are worth watching.

So I urge you to PLEASE buy Final Resolution 2005, you'll be glad that you did.

The Matches were BETTER than the ones @ New Year's Revolution, I mean The Elimination Chamber Match was OK, but the other matches were PATHETIC!

2418746,4,B000BITVNI,"TNA's January 2006 PPV Final Resolution is showcased by the wrestling return of the Icon, the man called Sting.  Final Resolution 2006 is a pretty good PPV.  Some quality matches, some not so good matches.  That's the formula for a lot of PPV's.  I won't go into every match on the card, but some of the better matches are AJ Styles vs. Tanahashi, Samoa Joe vs. Christopher Daniels and of course Sting/Christian Cage vs. Jeff Jarrett/Monty Brown.

Overall, a decent PPV with a great main event.  Sting's return to wrestling is awesome.  This is the top match on the PPV.  I literally could not wait to see Sting come down that rampway and it was eveything I thought it was going to be and more.  Sting did not look that bad either for his age and time away from the ring.  As the crowd chanted to Sting ""YOU STILL GOT IT"" and I would have to agree.  Sting didn't have any ring rust.

I highly recommend this PPV for any TNA fan and especially if you are a Sting fan.  I've followed TNA Wrestling since they debuted in Nashville, TN in 2002.  I'm happy they were to sign such an icon as Sting.  I only rated this PPV 4 stars because the overall card could of been better.  Seeing Sting back in professional wrestling alone is well worth the $15.  Keep up the good work TNA.

3 out of 4

The James Gang "" New Age Outlaws"" vs. The Diamonds In The Rough: The Tag matches are usually got but...not when it's a Diamonds in the Rough match. They just need to split up already, you always know they aren't gonna win anyway. PrimeTime is too good for a jobbing team that's just used to put other teams over. Plus after Konnan turned on BG James, you just wanna see them go at it. No one cared about this match.

The James Gang wins

2 out of 4

AJ Styles vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi (from New Japan Pro Wrestling) : This one seemed like it had more potential than what we got. Both can go and the match is good until Shannon Moore runs in and ruins it. He hits Hiroshi on accident when he's aiming for A.J. and then A.J. hits the Styles Clash for the Win.

2 1/2 out of 4

Raven vs. Sean Waltman: Why in the hell did TNA push Waltman as the guy to beat Raven in a you  lose and you're fired match ? I mean Waltman wouldn't even admit he had a good thing going in TNA. He'd call Triple H the whole time asking for his job in the WWE back. He only showed when he wanted to and infact this is the last time I've even seen him in TNA. Anyway Sean hits the X-Factor on Raven but Raven has his foot on the rope but Larry Z. who hates Raven and is the ref acts like he doesn't see Raven's foot on the rope. Waltman didn't deserve the win at all because when did he ever give TNA his 100% like Raven ? Anyway it's still an ok match but because of Raven.

2 out of 4

Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. ""Canadian Enforcer"" Bobby Roode: Both men can go but they really aren't the best combination. I mean prior to this match Bobby Rhoode had  a match with Killings where Killings kept pinning him and Rhoode demanded that the match was restarted until he got the win with the Lariat. So if you saw that match, you probably already had enough of seeing them in the ring together. Rhoode wins with the Lariat here too.

2 out of 4

Rhino vs. Abyss: Their Hardcore match a few ppvs later is a bit better but still this one isn't bad. Abyss is always a fun guy to watch and I'd love it if Jarrett actually stepped back and let another heel be champ in TNA. God knows Abyss can handle the job easily. Abyss wins this one with the blackhole slam I think.

3 out of 4

NWA World Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. Team 3D:

This isn't  a bad tag match. TNA rarely ever has bad tag matches. They could teach the WWE about tag matches. TNA has a strong roster of tag teams. They may not be able to beat Big Show or Kane but...they're more talented. AMW is one of the best teams of today and Dudleys gave the WWE their all until Vince was ready to give them their souls back by firing them. By firing them he allowed TNA to get their hands on them and put together this tag team dream match. It sucks that Team 3-D ""The Dudleys"" get screwed over by Team Canada though. Otherwise this isn't  a bad match.

3 out of 4

X-Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels : This could've been a better match if it wasn't strictly just meant to show how dangerous Samoa Joe is. He beats the crap out of the talented Danials until A.J. Styles gets nosey and throws the towel in for Danials. Samoa Joe kicks ass but it's making A.J and Danials look weak with how bad he kicks both their asses and how neither can beat him.

2 1/2 out of 4

Sting & Christian Cage vs. Jeff Jarrett & Monty Brown:

  Sting is back in the ring and the fans yell ""you still got it"" as he does the stingers splash and kicks some ass. This is a fun match and one of TNA's better mainevents at a ppv. Plus Christian and Jarrett work better together than Jarrett and Rhino do. They put on some good matches. Their singles match at the following ppv was way better than Cena and HHH's match at WM certainly. Anyway it's great seeing Sting back and he pins Jarrett with the Scorpion Death Drop for the win. Sting would be wasted in the WWE as just one of the legends added to HHH's list of people he beat. When he could kick HHH's ass, so he was smart for not going to the WWE and I hope he never ever goes there. The  WWE would ruin Sting.

3 1/2 out of 4

  TNA usually put on great ppvs but this one wasn't it's best yet I can't say it sucked either. It's great to see Sting back and for once the mainevent is the strongest match on the card.",1144540800,4,4504,4.073696145124717

Winners 3 Live Kru (8:21) 6.5/10

2.

3. Dustin Rhodes vs Kid Kash- Another good well done match with the New WWE Cruiserweight champ Kid Kash vs the man once known as goldust. Dustin put up a good fight against the former X division champ and managed to put him away to win his first TNA ppv ever. Winner Dustin Rhodes (10:50) 6.5/10

4. Raven vs Erik Watts- I don't care what anybody thinks I really like this match. One part is for raven and another reason is that they just work well together for this match. Raven shockingly lost to erik watts after the third choke slam. After the match raven knocked erik watts off of the stage. Winner Erik Watts (10:19) 7.5/10

5. Scott Hall vs ""The Charismatic Enigma"" with Special Guest Referee ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper- I also like this match a lot and jeff and scott also worked well together and then in the beginning of the match piper took all of the weapons from hall's outfit. Hall tried to use brass knuckles but piper poked him in the eye and then a twist of fate and a swanton bomb later jeff is the winner. After the Match the Monster Abyss returned back to TNA to destroy jeff hardy!! Winner ""The Charismatic Enigma"" Jeff Hardy (5:42) 7/10

6. ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown vs ""Big Sexy"" Kevin Nash vs Diamond Dallas Page(Number 1 Contenders Match for the NWA World Tile)- This match could have been a little bit better if the winner didn't have to fight in the main event but it was ok. Nash was eliminated by going over the top rope and monty brown reversed the diamond cutter into the POUNCE!!!! for the win and the shot at the NWA title.

AMW did every move they had to put away the champs including the powerplex but they were still in it. Johnny Devine is the one to cost Team Canada because he accidently hit eric young with the chair to give AMW the titles. Winners and new NWA Tag Team Champions American's Most Wanted (19:12) 9/10

8. Chris Sabin vs ""The Canadian Destroyer"" Petey Williams vs ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles Ultimate X Match for the X Division Championship- INCREDIBLE!! great action the best match of the whole pay per view. Three of the best in the X division ever in the coolest match ever created and sabin, AJ & Petey all hit their finisher and petey hit the hardest looking canadian destroyer ever. Sabin nearly killed aj with a dangerous dropkick that aj flipped all of the way over and nearly fell on his neck. AJ was down and petey and sabin were on the wires but AJ jumped up and knocked the title on the ground and grabbed it to become the new champ. Winner and New TNA X Division Champion ""The Phenomenal"" AJ Styles (19:55) 10/10

9. ""The Alpha Male"" Monty Brown vs ""The King OF The Mountain"" Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship- A Good Match for the main event and Monty Brown almost won the belt but jeff nailed monty with the guitar and hit the stroke 3 times to beat the alpha male and keep the gold. Winner and Still NWA World Heavyweight Champion ""The King Of The Mountain"" Jeff Jarrett (16:17) 8/10

This pay per view is awesome and you should get this pay per view if you like great wrestling or just like TNA.",1136592000,5,4101,4.463284379172229
2418760,5,B000BITVNI,"this years final resolution is going to be even better than the last one heres the card so far as well as a few guesses

raven vs. ? probably storm kidman or larry z him self should be a good match exspecialy if its a hardcore match or ravens rules should be ****

somoa joe vs. christiphor daniels this is the reason i want to get this ppv but i don't think daniels can pull the angles wings off on joe still should be *****

christian cage and sting vs. j.j and monty brown this could happen im not expecting much out of this so about ***

a.j styles vs sombody it doesnt matter who hes against he will still have a good match.

b.g james and kip james vs. konnan and ? i don't know whats ging on with killings so konnan will either have to face one of them or find himself a tag team partner.

rhino vs. abyss with this big ol team fued this is bound to happen eventually so why not now?

team 3d vs. a.m.w for the tag team titles this has gotta happen and ithink it willl be a great brawl with team 3d winning with a 3d!

cant think of any more matches so theres your final resolution card they might add sabu somewhere in there to",1135987200,,1135,4.013333333333334
2418761,2,B000BITVNI,"I'm an open TNA fan but even I gotta say this PPV/DVD is disappointing.  Alot of matches that look good on paper and even had decent storylines going into it but the action just didn't live up to the hype.  The best match of the night is on another TNA DVD that's the same price but is worth more of your money.

3LK vs. Christopher Daniels, Michael Shane & Kazarian - Average.  It wasn't horrible but nothing to really remember.

Elix Skipper vs. Sonjay Dutt - Good match from two from the X division.

Dustin Rhodes vs. Kid Kash - This match was a dud.

Raven vs. Erik Watts - Long & boring.

Jeff Hardy vs. Scott Hall with Roddy Piper as the referee - The best part of this match was the beginning when Piper was searching Hall & found everything but the kitchen sink hidden in his outfit.  Scott Hall just doesn't have it in him anymore & Hardy, the appearence of Piper, or the return of Abyss couldn't save this match.

Note: This is also available on ""Enigma: The Best Of Jeff Hardy"" DVD.

Monty Brown vs. Kevin Nash vs. DDP - This match was also a dissapointment because instead of being a normal triple threat match, they had a rule that you could be elimated by going over the top rope.  It was basically DDP & Nash taking turns beating up Monty Brown until Nash charged for DDP and fell over the top rope & he's elimated...just like that!  The rest of the match was nothing memorable since they were probably tryin' to save Brown's energy for the main event.

NWA Tag Champions Team Canada vs. AMW - Finally, things start to pick up here as this was one of the best matches of the night.  Great tag team match.  Look for the huge swelling bump on the head of one of the Team Canada members.

Ultimate X match: Petey Williams vs. Chris Sabin vs. AJ Styles - Another great match.  The way the match was won as something I didn't expect.

Note: This is also on the ""Best Of The X Division Vol. 1"" DVD.

NWA Champion Jeff Jarrett vs. Monty Brown - Their match on IMPACT a few weeks earler was alot better than this.  I'll give them credit for making Brown look unstoppable in this match but this was nothing memorable.

In the end, there were only 3 good matches and one of them is available on another DVD that's worth more of your buck than this one was.  I said it on my other reviews & I'll say it on this one too, the best TNA PPV's available right now are on that TNA Anthology box set (Victory Road, Turning Point, Lockdown).  I wouldn't get this, it's not worth your time.",1134691200,2,2486,4.251599147121535

8087186,5,B000BITVNI,One of my favorite PPVs. TNA PPVs in 2005 certainly felt like you got your money's worth as they put on their shows. Sonjay Dutt vs. Elix Skipper is awesome and Jeff Hardy vs. Scott Hall is hilarious. Styles vs. Sabin vs. Williams Ultimate X Match is still regarded as one of the best Ultimate X matches ever. AMW vs. Team Canada had what's still my favorite Tag Team Title Match. Ending out with Jarrett vs. Monty Brown that makes Brown look absolutely superhuman.

8087189,5,B000BITVNI,"TNA Final Resolution was one of the most important PPVS in history. It marked the return of Sting and helped TNA gain momentum in the coming year. It was a pretty solid show that did not disappoint.

Matt Bentley, Chris Sabin, Sonjay Dutt vs. Austin Aries, Alex Shelley, Roderick Strong. Great opener to start the show featuring some of the best young guns in TNA.

The James Gang "" New Age Outlaws"" vs. The Diamonds In The Rough. This was a good match. Diamonds in the Rough were a very underrated tag team. James Gang were well established and still had a lot left in the tank though they were nearing the end of their careers.

AJ Styles vs. Hiroshi Tanahashi Great match here as AJ had another strong showing as he truly was and always be the Face on TNA.

Raven vs. Sean Waltman: Great brawl and match by two great wrestlers. Raven always delivers a good match and Waltman looked good here. The match ended in controversy which hurt the match but furthered the storyline. I still like the match.

Ron ""The Truth"" Killings vs. ""Canadian Enforcer"" Bobby Roode. Awesome match. These two put on a good showing as it showed why Roode was a star in the making and why Killings was a great wrestler. It's a crime KIllings isn't in The TNA Hall Of Fame carrying the company in early years as champ.

Rhino vs. Abyss. Great match these two big guys had a good chemistry. Sometimes guys that have two like styles don;t work out like Lesnar and Goldberg at Wrestlemania 20 a crappy match here wasn't the case. The two put on a great match and it was a step forward in Rhino's career in TNA as he had become a very good supporting player backbone to TNA.

NWA World Tag Team Champions America's Most Wanted vs. Team 3D. This was a awesome match. The ending took away from it but this delivered. It was a dream match. AMW was just as good as Team 3D in 00's as they carried tag team wrestling from 2002 and on. It was a treat for the fans and one of the major reasons to buy this dvd is because of this dream match. I hope the two teams feuded more. As Team 3D went onto work with other teams.

X-Division Champion Samoa Joe vs. ""The Fallen Angel"" Christopher Daniels. Pretty good match Joe just beat the crap out of Daniels. This match was to show how dominant Joe was and a giant hint bigger things were in store for Joe in TNA.

Sting & Christian Cage vs. Jeff Jarrett & Monty Brown. This was the best match on the card. The fans went crazy when Sting's music hit. It was a great match between four great wrestlers and Sting showed he was still on top of his game at 47. Cage and Brown were great in the match. Gail Kim was great at ringside. It was the biggest match in TNA History. Sting helped put TNA on the map. He sparked a renewed interest in wrestling and without him TNA wouldn't have grown like it did.

  In conclusion this is a must buy. Final Resolution 2006 is one of the most historic wrestling ppvs of all time because it marks the return of Sting and he really started to help TNA gain momentum along with Christian's recent TNA signing. 2006 was a great year for TNA and wrestling. Cheers and enjoy!",1420848000,,3112,4.300854700854701

The 3 way Ultimate X match for the X Division Championship(AJ Styles vs Petey Williams vs Chris Sabin) was a super,high-flying & stellar classic that send the fans home happy. The NWA Worlds heavyweight championship match between Jeff Jarrett & Monty Brown was a decent bout that was marred once again by abundance of overbooking mess that seems to plague the main event scene.

8087193,4,B000BITVNI,"heres the matches and what i thought about them.
  1-team canada vs jay lethal and some nobodies.[5 stars out of 10.very average].eric young was one of team canada.lance hoyt from the other team.note the tattoo just above his [...].that is a popular thing GIRLS  do.its known as a tramp stamp unfortunately for anyone who has one.jay lethal was the only cool wrestler in this match.the end was cool.
  2-lax which is konan and homicide vs the naturals[5 stars].first of all,who the #$%^ are the naturals?the lax were good but the other guys kept stinking everything up.
  3-alex shelley and 2 bozos vs chris sabin,sonjay dutt and one bozo[7 stars=awesome!].alex shelley and chris sabin must not have been the motor city machine guns back then.it was cool to see such awesome wrestlers duke it out.chris sabin was totaly dominant though.im making the prediction right now! every time a great tag team breaks up,one wrestler sucks and the other is catapulted to super stardom.if the mcmg's ever break up,chris sabin will be champ one day.sonjay dutt?he's a guru now?hes on my backyard wrestling 2 game!
  4-james gang aka new age outlaws aka billy gunn and road dogg vs elix skipper and david young[who?].....5 stars...another snoozer.....what kind of goofy name is skipper?and billy gunn had his hair all up on his head pebbles style.definately weird,i know!
  5-aj styles vs tanahashi[6 stars-really good].this match was better than average but not too much better.there was a cool part where a dragon sleeper got combined with a giant swing.....
  6-raven vs x-pac in a no dq match[7 stars-awesome].these  2 brutalized eachother with a shopping cart.who wouldve thought a dork like the 123 kid couldve held up so well against the ever-brutal raven?
  7-robert roode vs ron ""the truth"" killings.[5 stars].you want the truth?this guy sucks! he's little more than a inner-city honkey tonk man.at least the honkey tonk man  won the ic belt.the only thing this guy ever did was suck.well when he wasn't busy blowing.and robert roode eventualy becomes one of beer money.why do they always sip thier beer like sissies anyway?
  8-rhino vs abyss[no dq][6 stars].abyss was once tna champion.rhino was once ecw tv and ecw world champion.of course rhino only got the tv title because rvd hurt himself.and the world title AFTER sandman had been in a match and couldn't stand.anyhow,it was a cool match but it wasn't anywhere near as bloody or violent as it shouldve been.
  9-the dudley boys vs james storm and chris harris.no dq....[6 stars].this couldve been another brutal match by the once ecw tag team  champions but it wasnt.the dudleys were going for the titles.not only that if they won it would be thier 19th title .more than that,nobody ever got that many or even close in case you didn't know. AND no one ever came close to winning the titles in 5 different leagues.the road warriors only had 3.the dudleys won it in wwe,wcw,ecw,tna and nwa.as an tribute,they even nailed the lod's doomsday device.
  10-christopher daniels vs samoa joe[7 stars].ultimate x title......i always thought christopher daniels eyes were creepy.they are sunk way into his head.i was thinking a lot during this match.""ho hum.i like it when samoa joe really lets loose.""well,he's the reason theres 7 stars.it was a really good match before samoa joe just FREAKING LOSES IT!it was very brutal,making a really good match into an awesome match.
  11-sting and christian vs jeff jarrett and monty brown.[6 stars].that last match stole the show.the match was better than average i guess.i was really looking at gail kims [...].they just don't look that big now on wwe.....

  i got this dvd for free at a live show so it was worth my money.i'd buy it too.one great reason is because wwe pay per views normaly only have 6 matches.this one has 11.the last royal rumble only had 3 and told who the winner of 2 of them were on the back of the dvd.",1302825600,,3913,4.922256097560975
