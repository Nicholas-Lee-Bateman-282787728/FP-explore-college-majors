5232207,5,B00915G6R6,"most producers with this show would have taken the standard route and turned this into a melodrama over which of the two lawyers gets our main character. in this much smarter show, that has been taken off the table to pursue more and more interesting stories, in this episode we continue to see how a law firm struggles under a bankruptcy overhaul with nathan lane as trustee . this has truly comic moments such as when lawyers are forced to share offices. we also see all characters struggle with peter's mother Jackie without realizing that there is something seriously wrong with her. she is having hallucinations, seeing bugs where are none.  also her thought processes are getting jammed. she has always been so out of step with the present day world that they think it is just this same old problem with her.  then there is this week's court case which involves super inventive moves by opposing counsel which alicia and diane struggle to parry in court.  very, very smart law show and it shows that ridley scott, the famous and esteemed film director, is at the helm as producer.

5232209,5,B00915G6R6,"Alicia is trying to win an internet lawsuit when Eli warns her that a reporter (the fabulous Miriam Shor) is about to print a story about Alicia and Will's affair. It turns out the story is about Peter and a campaign worker, and Alicia emotionally relives Peter's previous betrayals all over again. Kalinda continues her S&M relationship with her husband, while helping Eli determine if the campaign worker is telling the truth. And Rita Wilson is back as a lawyer trying to get Nathan Lane (as trustee) to intervene in Alicia and Will's case. A great episode with a great ending.",1350259200,6,580,4.752475247524752

There is great drama and surprise twists in a system of law grown so large that if you were a speed reader and tried to read existing, new laws would be passed before you finished and/or old laws would be reinterpreted. Then you're got jurisdictional issues and all those government employees, bureaucrats, police, and foreign diplomatic immunity exempt from the law or protected by their brethren.

This is a fun show that leaps through different points of view. Enjoy.

5232948,5,B00915G6R6,"Not just for Season 4, but from beginning to end: Terrifically intelligent and entertaining show on every level! Absolutely nothing--NOTHING!---stupid about it! Every actor is pitch-perfect, but I especially love Margulies, Baranski, and Cumming. And all those NY-based character actors whose names we don't remember but who've served as the staple of TV shows from way back forever are such a treat.  I stopped watching ""free"" network TV ages ago because I thought the shows had become uniformly unwatchable. It turns out I was wrong. It's the perfect combination of episodic procedural, longer story arcs, and ripped-from-the-headlines issues, but with seriously fine character development. I have to add that Margulies' and Baranski's wardrobes are just luscious. I wanna look like them! This show reminds me of ER in it's quality of production and writing, except that it's actually way better. Definitely a thinking preson's procedural.",1482019200,2,941,5.489655172413793

The case of the hour will be concluded by the end of the episode, no matter how complex it may seem when only five minutes from episode's end. Then there is the overall arc of the season, which climaxes at season's end leaving the viewer curious as to what will happen next. I look forward to Season Five.",1473033600,,475,4.409090909090909

Season three of ""The Good Wife"" was good, but certain episodes were a bit far fetched, and, as I have said before, Kalinda is able to accomplish things no one could possibly do.  Season 4 hit my ""one season too far"" rule.  Kalinda's husband was completely absurd and the overall story of Will and Alecia was really getting old.  I have finished watching the whole series, but the show just keeps getting more tiresome and boring.  A good end should have come after season three.",1471651200,,609,4.541284403669724

The character Eli Gold is especially good as he is walking a very fine line and is so expressive, just in his little facial expressions.  The story is good, the acting is good.  Not real pleased with all the sex and obvious politics in it...that would be my only negative.

5236115,3,B00915G6R6,"So, it started out great.  No cursing to speak of, no naked women, just people acting.  And then a sudden turnaround in the 5th season.  They started playing music during the scenes (like the movie Fantasia, which was the name of a character as well) and had characters act like their lives went from one crisis to another every single day.  To me, this means they either changed writers or just plain got bored with it and so did I.  They never developed the husband's role and no one was predictable from day to day.  One minute they were best friends and then suing each other.

All in all, if you have something good to watch, stay there.  If you're bored, go here, at least until season 5...then just say goodbye.",1469232000,,718,4.427480916030534

5236160,5,B00915G6R6,"The Good Wife is to the law as ER was to emergency medicine and nursing, and they're both set in Chicago and star Ms. Margulies. And (spoiler alert) Zoe even shows up as Will's sister in Season 4. I'm a nurse and totally get how ER was more about the relationships than the patient care, even though the producers did respond to criticism that they showed an unrealistically high recovery rate post cardiac arrest and CPR by having more codes end in death (success rate, measured as 30-day survival and discharge from hospital, is around 5% for out-of-hospital arrests, and not a lot better in-hospital). So too I hope that the writers will heed the inevitable squawks from my legal colleagues. But even if they don't, you shouldn't watch either of these fine shows expecting to learn a lot about reality in an ER or a court room. Watch it for the fine acting, the well-developed characters, the guest stars and subplots, the drama, the humor, the missed chances, and the triumphs. And whoever the designer is that did all the female costumes-- all those ruffles and pintucks! Nice ties, too.",1469059200,,1092,4.722513089005235

What i love about the show is how human some of the characters are, you start to care about the characters with each episode wanting to see the villains punished and the innocent exonerated and the hurt you feel when it doesn't work out that way. Since i got Prime i have been binge watching the series and now that i'm almost at the end i find myself trying to only watch one episode a night to make it last longer.

It has also been rather enjoyable and amusing seeing the various celebrities that appeared ad judges or as client's as well as opposing attorneys.
I am surprised the children manage to stay looking as though they are still young teenagers even though a few years have passed since the series began. I like this season particularly well because I like the idea of Alicia and Peter getting along well. There were quite a few thought provoking episodes in season 4. I am not sure of I think leaving Lockhart and Gardner is a good idea bit I understand it was necessary because it would be to hard to be confronted with something you want every day when you know you cannot have it  I very much like being able to watch as many episodes as I wish without commercials not payment ad it is included in Prime.",1465257600,,977,4.614942528735632

5237878,5,B00915G6R6,"Absolutely amazing.  I confess that I found Alicia Florrick to be a pain in the ass much of the time.  She couldn't make up her mind; she allowed herself to do things that she didn't want to do; she drifted into affairs because she lacked self-control.  The fact that she and they got involved with a certified scum-bag like Lemond what's-his-name showed a major lack of good sense.  The Michael J. Fox character was a refined white bread version of Lemond.

But Kalinda Sharma and the crazy lawyer were absolutely precious.  Kalinda is one of my favorite characters of all time.  If charm, innocence, sweetness, and vulnerability didn't work, then she used seduction.  If seduction didn't work or was inappropriate, she broke her targets knee caps.  My kind of woman.

And the crazy lawyer!  Crazy really is close to creative; it's a genetic thing.  And she had her crazy under control and her creativity was awesome.

But the main reason that I like this show so very, very much is the practice of the law, legal logic, the biases, how the justice system really works.  And they seemed to deliberately go after real world issues.  I loved it.  I learned.  I agreed with Alicia when she said that the law was neither good nor bad; it is neutral.  It is how we keep from killing each other.",1463788800,2,1290,4.607929515418502

As an avid binge-watcher I would recommend this season and all other seasons of this show to be watched thoroughly. This is truly one of my favorite shows ever.

5239830,2,B00915G6R6,"I commented on another reviewer's statements regarding the unfortunate decision to take Kalinda's character down the wrong path. The addition of an abusive husband who has some type of sick hold over an otherwise strong character did nothing to enhance the mystery of Kalinda. In fact, it diminished her character. I don't think the writers really understood the strength of the character they had created. Whatever they intended her to be, Archie Panjabi took her beyond that scope and created a truly unique and memorable woman. It's no wonder Panjabi left the series after Josh Charles, and now, Julianna Margulies appears to be leaving as well. Even the Kings are leaving. In my opinion, the problems start with not fully appreciating the complexity of Kalenda's character. The decision to portray her as just another of Peter's conquests to damage her friendship with Alicia was the first of several miscalculations in developing the character of Kalinda Sharma. The writers took the easy way out with Kalinda and focused on superficial sexual encounters rather than providing more substantive character development. There are still many fine episodes in The Good Wife. But the heart has gone out of it.",1453593600,9,1208,5.168367346938775

This and several other problems Amazon practices always makes me want to not renew my membership and of course I have never gotten a renewal notice that I am going to be charged for the next year, but this year I am going to make a large notice on my desk so that it won't happen again.  Plus the quality of the streaming is at times very poor.  I don't have this problem with Netflix and I feel like I have more control over my own account that I have already paid for.

We were left at the end of the last season wondering if Alicia would reconcile with Peter and move back into their old home. There's no mention of it. Peter is running for office an there are many scenes of the 2 of them having sex in his tour bus. The Will/ Alicia thing is becoming silly. And Kalindas husband shows up, terrorizes her then just disappears. We've always seen Kalinda as a strong/take no crap kind of lady-enduring this abuse is so out of character. There are great cases and court scenes to keep you hooked but the back stories are just not so strong. The whole premise of the show was Alicia's evolution of the wronged woman to the independent force to be reckoned with. The multiple scenes with Peter in his bus make no sense in this regard. It appeared in the previous season that she was done with him and now she comes across as desperate for contact with him! What's going on?

5240002,4,B00915G6R6,"Maybe unintentionally, the way white people often are - just from being able to see the world only from their own POV. We're binge-watching on Prime - now halfway through Season 4. And despite all the good things that stand out - the acting especially, the plot twists, the writing - so far there are ZERO sympathetic African-American characters. There are ZERO major black characters - at least permanent ones. They're relegated to intermittent roles if they get any face time at all. And so far I can't think of one that comes off looking good.

I'm not talking about, say, Donna Brazile - she was a one-time (so far) minor character. I'm talking about the black guy who tried to take over the firm; the black L&G partner Julius, who frowns a lot and is mostly angry, and who could be given a prominent role but is strictly minor; the black ASA woman who, while she gets to make good points, is a very negative, angry, frowning character; her fellow male ASA who also should have been promoted and wasn't is also a negative, unsmiling, cold character; the warm, pretty and smiling ASA who ran against Peter and lost, and is kind of like a warm, pretty and smiling viper - she could have been made into a positive character, but no; there was a very negative, cold, arrogant sports-drug analyst in the show we just watched (""Je ne sais what?""). And the single attractive black character is a major drug dealer who obviously has had people killed for crossing him - he's big and rich and charismatic and handsome and soft-spoken, and he's portrayed as a warm, loving dad to his son, but still...he's a drug dealer! And for black characters, that's about it.

Maybe I'm missing some, but they're not major and not enough to balance the sheer negativity of black characters in this show. Oh wait - there's Zach's black girlfriend - she's positive, but in a very small role.

Even when race is a major issue in an episode (I can remember only one), it's handled badly. In this last episode (""Je ne sais what?"") Peter is accused of racism in the way he runs his department - he fired or demoted 5 black ASAs and promoted 2 white ones with less experience and seniority, and so he gives a speech to a black organization and says his department prosecutes too many African-Americans and he's gonna find out why. He's booed, but Eli, his campaign manager, tells him that was his ""Sister Souljah moment."" Say what? That happened when Bill Clinton - once referred to as America's first black president because of his sympathy for the plight of African-Americans - denounced the lyrics of rapper Sister Souljah. Yeah, the non-racist white guy unafraid to tell blacks when they're wrong. But that's not what Peter was doing at all - which just shows me that the writers/producers don't know what they're talking about because they're just so...white.

Yes, it was created by two very white, pretty old people, but you'd think they'd get a clue. I mean, I'm as old and white as they are, but this aspect of the show is becoming very glaring to me. I like the show despite this failing, and I searched online for the criticism I'm making here but couldn't find any. Maybe it's just me, but I don't think so. In fact, I find this absence of criticism of the way black characters are portrayed even more curious. I'm watching the show differently since I started noticing this aspect of it in the second or third season, and so now when there are black characters, my antennae swivel toward the TV.",1447804800,,3483,4.594855305466238

5240091,4,B00915G6R6,I enjoy the cases that they present and all the law jargon. The clothes that the ladies wear are so smart. My favorite character is Elsbeth Tasioni. I took away one star because they make it very clear that the main character is an atheist. I am conservative and liberalism is spread on thickly ALL through the shows. I guess that is another world and is realistic. I still watch it although sometimes with a frown.,1446422400,,415,4.473684210526316

The arc that begins here and continues for the next two years is an amazing feat of writing and show running. The first few years were fun, but by Season 4 it feels like the earlier seasons were laying pipe for a more challenging overarching plot line. As usual, the side characters enliven the series (WHY have they not spun-off Carrie Preston's Elsbeth Tacsioni into her own show?).",1444867200,,515,4.863636363636363

The scenes between Will and Alicia were great and it was good to see that they were still struggling with feelings and horrible timing. I really loved how Alicia's mom talked to Will. I was so disappointed at the last moments of the season when she was meeting with Cary and not Will. I guess I will hope that season 5 figures out Alicia and Will. Ever since I've started binge watching this show, I've told everyone I know to start watching because I really do think it's one of the best shows out there.",1444435200,,649,4.327868852459017

I was not a prime time watcher and have only viewed these first seasons on Amazon prime. I am curious about how the current series on prime time will be.

5240496,5,B00915G6R6,"This series is one of the best, most intelligent and thoroughly entertaining series on television. It centers on Alicia Florrick, a lawyer working her way in a top law firm after being out of the workforce for many years. She's married to Peter Florrick, a man driven by political ambition, who was caught with his pants down literally, after having had extra-marital affairs, including frequenting prostitutes. He's in the process of resurrecting his tarnished reputation and realizing his desire to be Governor. Alicia does an incredible balancing act between moving up in her own career, with all of its pitfalls and victories, while being the wronged wife who stands by her man in an attempt to salvage her badly damaged marriage. She is, however, her own woman, bright, intuitive and total class. I love this series. Can hardly wait for the new season to begin!",1440720000,,866,4.979310344827586
5240497,4,B00915G6R6,"Stone-faced Alicia Florrick has an on-going physical and emotional affair with her homely looking Law Firm Boss/Sr. Partner/Ex-College Sweetheart, after her good looking state's attorney for Cook County husband was imprisoned after a sex and corruption scandal, of which he is later found innocent. Alicia deals with the public humiliation by focusing on her newly ignited law career and her on-going affair with her homely Law Firm Boss/Sr. Partner/Ex-College Sweetheart, who she openly admits she doesn't love, while she definitely still loves her husband. The hypocrisy of ""appearing"" to hold moral high, ground while cheating just as her husband did, even after he has apologized, renewed his faithfulness, and cleaned up his public office sure does not make her ""The Good Wife"" just because she isn't divorcing her husband. On top of that Alicia is an avowed atheist, while her daughter and estranged husband seek and find Christianity, while her children fend off the sexual advances of mult...

Love GoodWife's well-woven threads of story and character in which no one is a saint and even the vilest find redemption. Not to mention the delicious reprehensible machinations of lawyers and politics and courtroom manipulations interspersed with moments of shining heroism. And most of all the emergence of a woman discovering her own power (the title is ironic, obviously). Hooray for Amazon Prime-streaming. I'd recommend a treadmill setup to go with it, however.",1440720000,,615,5.099009900990099

Thank goodness for Amazon Prime which lets me get the first few seasons for free and if I find I like it, I can begin recording the current season on television and will have that ready when I catch up.

The Good Wife is an entertaining show with enough interest areas outside the main story line to provide variation. If you like legal shows (not really a crime show), you would likely enjoy this.",1438214400,,616,4.256410256410256

Alicia Florrick is inspiring, complicated, and yet so human. I have enjoyed her growth as a character throughout the show. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when first starting the show and now i am on season 6 lol. Great job with casting!!!",1436745600,,375,4.611940298507463

8533749,5,B00915G6R6,"""The Good Wife"" is a masterful CBS legal and family drama. Season 4 continues its depiction of the travails and tribulations of a middle-age woman whose entire life was upended by the scandalous and criminal behavior of her husband, which had landed him in prison, and unable to care for his family. She is a law school graduate who has not practiced law for many years, after having given up her career to raise her children and manage the household. She re-entered the workforce as a junior associate at a prestigious law firm, and one of the name partners of her new firm is a former law school classmate, who had once been a very close friend. In this fourth season, the lead character continues in her role as a premier litigator for her financially-troubled law firm, and regularly takes on the most challenging and high-profile cases. ""The Good Wife"" is an interesting and compelling television program, which is characterized by superb writing, intelligent and thought-provoking story lines, and excellent plot and character development. The acting is first-rate, with stellar performances by the ensemble cast, which includes Julianna Margulies, Chris Noth, Christine Baranski, Josh Charles, Matt Czuchry, Zach Grenier, Archie Panjabi, Alan Cumming, Michael J. Fox, Carrie Preston, Makenzie Vega, and Graham Phillips, to name a few. I thoroughly enjoyed watching ""The Good Wife,"" and I found it to be decidedly engaging and entertaining. ""The Good Wife"" is an outstanding television series, which truly merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1494979200,,1581,5.252964426877471

8533753,5,B00915G6R6,"First of all note, that in each series year, the title of the episode has as many words as the series Year. Year one- title is one word, Year four- title us four words.

When all is said and done the fourth season of The Good Wife is a good one. It brings with it the most amazing music. We Know the amazing cast, Julianne Margolis is the Good Wife, Chris Noth is the Bad Husband, and this thing about the marriage, does it break up, what does the Good Wife do, how does the family react, and what about that mother-in-law?

We know the firm where Alicia is now an attorney, Lockhart and Gardner. Will Gardner played by Josh Child's is an old lover of Alicia, Diane Lockhart, played by Christine Baranski is the other formidable partner. Archie Panjabi plays the sexy, wonderful Kalinda. Alan Cumming plays Eli Gold, the cunning chief of staff for Peter. How the world does roll.

Kalinda has a prime partbin this series. She lets us know she is not gay, but she is flexible. An old flame, husband finds her, and they are not on good terms except in bed, and now in the courtroom. Expect fireworks. Peter faces a formidable political opponent as he rubs for Governor, and he faces a big surprise,  The guest stars are ever more brighter and funnier.

When the Good Wife started there had been a rash of good wives of politicians whose husbands had done them wrong. What a wonderful opportunity for a series. However. As the series moves along, we find Alicia Florrick as the Good Wife. Will she forgive her husband, Peter, as he Enters jail for corruption charges? As the States Attorney for Cook County will this end his career?

And, as the series follows Alicia, what happens to the Good Wife after the scandal wears down? How does the family move on, we discover all of this in season one. A remarkable cast and an excellent first season. Kudos reign for all.
