4069848,3,B00352G1AI,"Wonderful actors and actresses who do what they can with a horribly written script. The story could have been put together more, timing could have been sharper, but fell flat and missed the mark many, many, many times throughout the movie. Hopefully the third movie will be more skillful written and won't lose the wonderful actors from the previous movies.",1309996800,,357,4.966666666666667

4069850,3,B00352G1AI,"Nice little film that might appeal to the 12-14 year old girl.  David Tennant, while lovely in the salt and pepper hair could've been a little less camp and a little edgier.  Rupert Everett was adequate but his performance was spotty.

Rainy afternoon film will go well with a bowl of popcorn.",1291766400,4,293,4.596153846153846
4069851,5,B00352G1AI,This movie was just a great and weird as the first one. It will never cease to make me laugh.,1377302400,,93,3.7
4069852,1,B00352G1AI,Received the DVD in a format not usable in the United States (PAL).  I am unable to open and view the movie.  I do not know what to do about it.,1370390400,,144,3.6129032258064515
4069853,1,B00352G1AI,"Don't waist your money, not even David Tennant can help this film. The writing is bad, the acting is bad, the comady is bad. I have finally seen something that David Tennant has done which totally stinks. I guess one item in 22 years of work is not bad. The only reason I gave this film one star is because you can't give it zero stars.",1366848000,,336,4.106060606060606
4069854,4,B00352G1AI,"The first time I watched this film, I thought, yuk. Not so good. But it grows on you, and it did eventually win me over. Sad to see that Flash Harry isn't in this one, still, it's cute and though it's not a great follow-up to the earlier film, it's not terrible.",1365552000,,262,4.0576923076923075
4069855,5,B00352G1AI,"First let me rave about this seller :) The movie was of high quality and I appreciate the seller's care and expediency about shipping this movie, difficult to acquire in Region 1--although many region 2s. I am especially pleased with this seller's policy to keep it's buyer's happy. I am truly happy and woud DEFINITELY buy from this seller again if seeing media.
This movie was very good and I totally love the St Trinian's. Like most sequels, it doesn't hold the boldness of the original movie, but it was still very satisfying and full of action and adventure that the girls of St. Trinian behold. I would really recommend this movie, and it's especially fun to watch back to back from the first on this line~ :) Not as much Colin Firth as in the first, but Rupert Everett still shines in the role of Fritton :) I would love to see another made with more heat of Geoffery/Camilla flirtation--like that of the implications and innuendo's of the first St. Trinians. I'm not sure if anyone can top Kelly as Head Girl. but overall St Trinians is a wonderful comedy...I wonder if they can incorporate Hugh Grant! hahaha ;)",1365120000,,1120,4.605
4069856,4,B00352G1AI,"Not as good as the first St. Trinian's films, but still wild and raucous enough to make a pleasant evening.  David (Dr. Who) Tenant
makes an interesting villain, a pompous young windbag just begging to be deflated by the crazy St. Trinian's girls.",1365033600,,247,4.744186046511628
4069857,3,B00352G1AI,"if only there was a warning that this product couldn't be used by american products, i tried 4 different dvd playes, two different laptops and even a few game systems and none could play this movie",1363651200,,197,4.5
4069858,5,B00352G1AI,I love this movie...not quite as much as the first one but it still makes me laugh out loud. The DVD arrived on time and this was a good experience for me.,1357948800,,155,3.875
4069859,5,B00352G1AI,This movie has roots that date back to the 1960 British comedy.  Colin Firth is refreshingly funny as headmistress Fritton.  Oddly enough the character played as Miss Fritton is a combination of Camille Boles and the queen mum.  This has to have the Royals all up in arms ....  I bet you that Kate and William have seen this movie and their prequels many times,1347926400,,360,4.492307692307692
4069860,1,B00352G1AI,"Guess I should have read the fine print.  Apparently this was a ""REGION 2"" item....I had no idea what that meant.  Obviously this means it won't play in the USA.  Paid almost as much for shipping as I did for the movie and they refused to refund the shipping.  Why are you even selling these in the US??  Who would even have one of these special DVR's and special TV's in the states?  Ridiculous....bet it won't even work on one of those....",1339545600,,441,4.317073170731708
8388600,5,B00352G1AI,"Very good follow-up to the St. Trinian's original movie. We have a region-free DVD player but if you don't, keep in mind that this will not play on most DVD players sold in the USA. It may play on your laptop or PC if you use VLC Media Player, a free program available on the internet (download it from VideoLAN when you do your web search). This movie has David Tennant as the bad guy, and he plays it well enough that you can forget that he was Dr. Who # 10.

(If you are looking for a region free DVD or Blu Ray player, try searching for 220 electronics.",1451606400,,557,4.0636363636363635
