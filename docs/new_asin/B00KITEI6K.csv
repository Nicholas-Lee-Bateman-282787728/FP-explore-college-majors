8659338,2,B00KITEI6K,"I really enjoy a lot of reality tv shows like Ice Road Truckers, Swamp People, Ghost Hunters, etc., but this one seems extremely staged to me and very corny.  Shelby tries too hard and comes off as a stupid, loud drama queen that you can't hardly understand.  I've watched the first four episodes and will probably watch the rest because I work hard for my money, but I won't buy the next season.",1477094400,,396,4.410958904109589
