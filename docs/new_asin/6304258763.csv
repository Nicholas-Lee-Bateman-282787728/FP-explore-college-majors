822091,1,6304258763,"I love silent films. I saw this on TCM and LOVED IT! So, I wanted to add it to my collection and was excited to see it was actually being sold on Amazon.

I popped it in and was absolutely abhorred! Whoever ""made"" this DVD desicrated it with horrible music and the woman narrating it was excruciatingly annoying. After 5 minutes I couldn't stand watching it anymore.

I wish they would not have dubbed over the original music and left out the narrator. Why ruin such a good movie??

I completely regret this purchase.",1417305600,,517,4.4787234042553195

822093,4,6304258763,"An interesting movie to watch for anyone who wasn't or was aware of this silent ""Oz"" movie. However this movie does not include the yellow brick road, the munchkins, the ruby slippers, the talking trees, the dog Toto or the witch. The farmhand who would become the Tin Man is kind of a bad guy trying to win Dorthy's heart, like Brutus would Olive. Apparantly Dorthys uncle is also a bad guy who chases the farmhand, who would become the scarecrow, around the farm for what feels like half an hour. It's all a bunch of Charlie Chaplin slapstick comedy with the bad guy not being able to catch the hero of the scene. A weird twist occurs when, in Oz, the three farmhands, who also travel to Oz with Dorthy, dress up in disguises, in an attempt to hide from the soilders of oz and pretend to be the infamous characters that Dorthy meets (in the book and 1939 version) along the way, altering (or destroying) Dorthy's experience of actually meeting a talking lion, a man made out of tin and a talking scarecrow. The movie is so different from the 1939 movie and 1900 book that I actually liked how each scene was becoming more bizzare and distant from the classic Judy Garland movie that has become impregnated in our minds since we all first saw it as kids. For a unique interesting movie, five dollars is a generous price. Enjoy a really different version of a classic American story. For two more older versions of Oz, check out the three-disk version of the 1939 movie. Included on the third disk is an older 13 minute version from 1910 and an 8 minute animated version from 1933. It also has this 1925 version as well as 2 other Oz movies, ""His Majesty, The Scarecrow Of Oz"" and ""The Magic Cloak Of Oz"", both from 1914.",1167177600,2,1721,4.4321766561514195
822094,3,6304258763,"I'm rather embarrassed that I believed all of the negative hype about this film (how it was racist, unfunny, and just in general a bad movie) without ever having even seen it to be able to judge it for myself.  Hearing what a lot of other people have had to say about any given product can give one a good general idea about what to expect, but that doesn't compare to actually seeing it for yourself and being able to form your own opinion.  I found myself rather liking this film and being very impressed by Larry Semon, whom I'd long been interested in anyway.  One wishes that more of his films survived and were easily-accessible instead of in archives, museums, and out of print videos.  It's not fair to judge him as a comedian and his entire body of work based on this film, which came rather late in his career and thus isn't entirely reprensentative of what he was capable of.

Of course nothing can compare to the 1939 screen version of L. Frank Baum's classic novel, but taken for what it is, the 1925 version also tells a good story even though it does take more liberties with the storyline.  The first half I found to be very funny, with Dorothy (Semon's real-life wife Dorothy Dwan, who was significantly younger than he was), her aunt and uncle, and the three hired hands (Larry, Spencer Bell, and Oliver Hardy) working around the family farm.  There are a lot of funny scenes, like the one with the swarm of angry bees and the ones where Larry and Ollie are competing for Dorothy's romantic attentions.  Larry Semon really was a born clown, with his funny physical appearance, clever pantomime, and great physical reactions.  Along the way we discover that Dorothy is really a princess who was left on the doorstep as a baby, and that on her 18th birthday she is supposed to return to Oz so she can rule and marry Prince Kynd.  (I loved the funny names the Oz characters had, like Prince Kynd, Lady Vishuss, Ambassador Wikked, and Prime Minister Kruel.)  While the family are hiding from a bunch of bad guys who don't want Dorothy to find out the secret of her birth, a tornado strikes, and they find themselves in the Land of Oz.  Once in Oz, Dorothy is welcomed, but her family's farmhands are not.  They proceed to disguise themselves (Larry is the Scarecrow, Ollie is the Tinman, and ""Snowball,"" played by Spencer Bell [who is shockingly billed as ""G. Howe Black""], is the Cowardly Lion.  (I got the impression that this film was horribly racist, though apart from the ""G. Howe Black"" thing, I didn't really find anything that offensive about ""Snowball.""  He does act in an overly caricatured way, but that was kind of par for the course in most films in 1925, and just because someone is made to act in a stereotyped fashion doesn't mean that he's an unsympathetic character.)  Most of the rest of the film takes place in the dungeon, where Uncle Henry and the three farmhands have been banished to, but which they are trying to escape so that Dorothy won't marry the wrong man (in their opinion at least).  The scene in the dungeon is a bit long drawn-out and not quite as funny as the first half of the film, though it's not without some good moments.  And in spite of the less than enlightened portrayal of ""Snowball,"" this character is actually instrumental in saving the day.  Larry might not have escaped from the dungeon if it weren't for ""Snowball.""

I think the real problem with this film isn't that it takes so many liberties with the book or isn't the movie version most people are familiar with, but rather because it's just not as well-developed or tightly-plotted as it could have been.  There are a lot of scenes that are good or interesting in and of themselves, but which don't really contribute much or anything to the overall storyline.  Things happen that never go anywhere, and there are a lot of unresolved bits of business.  The end in itself is also kind of in media res, and I totally understand why a lot of people say that this movie was just a big ego trip for Larry Semon, whom they feel cared more about trying to be funny even if it meant sacrificing a coherent smooth plot.  The individual scenes are good, but together they don't really add up to a perfect whole.  It also helps if one is watching a good print with an appropriate soundtrack.  Usually I dislike it when people complain too much about print quality and soundtracks, as though everyone's idea of what appropriate and inappropriate are is the same, and as though we should expect all films that are this old to have wonderful print quality, but here it really is true that neither are appropriate.  The best version out there, print-wise and sountrack-wise, is the one included as a bonus feature on the deluxe three-disc edition of the 1939 version of this famous tale.",1153699200,2,4791,4.566588785046729
822095,2,6304258763,"Although I love the actual film I think it could have done with out the narrator. I mean, it's a silent film with swome annoying lady reading to you. Her voice made me want to scratch my eyeballs out. It was like listening to a book on tape, and completely makes a joke out of the movie all together. But I would also like to say that just because a few of the previous customers didn't realize that this film was made in 1929 which would make it silent and means it is NOT the film starring Judy Garland doesn't mean that it was bad. Also I'm disappointed that others think they have educated themselves on Frank L. Baum or any of his books. The 1939 Wizard of Oz only involves some of the stories since there are over 14. Besides Baum helped with this film, meaning he was creating a story there himself. Just because they didn't pick up a book and act out every word doesn't mean it wasn't Baum's creation. This film was another of Baum's story using another medium.

With that said, although the film's music and narration is a joke, I suggest seeing it and keeping your minds open to the fact that there was a world before Judy Garland.",1117756800,2,1141,4.306976744186047
822096,3,6304258763,"Well, for one thing. The story sticks pretty close in Dorothy's background. She has an Aunt Em and Uncle Henry. She lives on a farm. Some connection right there. It falls down quite a bit connection-wise in establishing Dorothy was discovered as a baby by her aunt and uncle. A poster here says the actress in this film playing Dorothy is Semon's wife. Actually I think the lady was instead Oz author L. Frank Baum's daughter-in-law. I wonder if the monarch bit of this story was inspired by the collapse of European monarchies seven years earlier.",1103932800,,548,4.71875
822097,1,6304258763,"Imagine your local church putting on a production of ""The Wizard of Oz"" with costumes made out of sheets and a production budget of 80$. Imagine it being directed by someone without the least bit of background in direction or production. Imagine it starring the most untalented individuals. What you have is this piece of utter trash. Larry Semon was a very unfunny and crude physical comic who bought the rights to the Oz books in an attempt to give a boost to his slapstick career that was going nowhere. Between buying the rights and filming the first scenes of the elves workshop, he spent his entire budget. With no money left, he just turned on the cameras and filmed and filmed - without a script! Lots of pratfalls and endless grimacing. The result bombed - as it should have! This is one of the worst silent movies ever made. Semon was so devastated that he disappeared off the face of the earth. No one even knows when he died or where he was buried! He was never heard from again. Unfortunately, lots of Oz fans have sought out this mess - thinking that there must be some value to it. There isn't! Save your money!!",1103673600,5,1127,4.475728155339806
822098,1,6304258763,"Folks, don't let the title fool you. This story is only loosely connected to the L. Frank Baum books or the 1939 film that is the definite version. Basically, this is a cornball slapstick-happy tale about 1920s comic Larry Semon fighting for Dorothy's hand in marriage. Filled with bad puns and corny gags (an African-American character is billed as ""G. Howe Black""-a real knee slapper ain't it)? The only reason anyone would have to watch this (Baum himself died by this time and had nothing to do with the story) is because of the early appearance of Oliver Hardy as the tin man (and this is not one of his better roles). Nah, see it just for curiousity and read the Baum books or the Judy Garland film for the real deal. Early in the film, a little girl who is having this tale read to her (she must have been really naughty to deserve such punishment) says, ""Oh Grampy, I don't like that!""

822258,5,6304258763,"This movie was terrible! Maybe the fact that I'm such a devoted fan to the 1939 movie and L. Frank Baum's books made me despise this movie so much, but it really is a disgrace! I saw it on dvd. I am a huge Oz collector so I thought I should check this out, but it's really a waste of time. It strays so far from the real story. In this one, Uncle Henry seems abusive to Dorothy and Aunt Em and Dorothy is the queen of Oz. The Scarecrow and the Tin Man are farmhands who dress up as these characters to escape being arrested by what seems to be Oz soldiers. DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO WATCH IT!

822259,2,6304258763,"Frank Joslyn Baum felt that he, as L. Frank Baum's eldest son, was the best person to carry on the Oz series, and was struck aghast when his father's publisher employed Ruth Plumly Thompson after his father died, and with his mother's approval.  Later on, they even halted the publication of his Oz Big Little Books (the first of the intended two has become one of the most sought after BLBs of all time due to its low print run--and its publication is still barred to the present day).  Despite a 1918 letter from LFB praising how much better written FJB's letter to him was than anything he had written, FJB, like most of his other descendents clearly did not have the talent of his father (though Roger S.--directly descended from FJB, is the worst).

The younger Baum, however, was able to negotiate business deals that brought about this film, the 1933 animated short (which he wrote), and the 1939 MGM musical.
For some reason, the younger Baum, who even had the audacity to bill himself as ""L. Frank Baum, Jr."" (even though L. Frank Baum would never have named his son ""Lyman"") decided that the material made a suitable vehicle for Larry Semon, a second-string star battling alcoholism (and who would die of stomach cancer a few years later), and proceeded to change it heavily.
Taking a partial cue from his father's 1914 film, _His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz_, which was based on _Wizard_, but so heavily different that Baum expanded it into the novel _The Scarecrow of Oz_ the next year, FJB , with Semon and Leon Lee, wrote this all-a-dream story about the politics of the Emerald City, which was also a major subject of the 1902 musical, though much more successfully.  (_The Scarecrow of Oz_ mentions the death of Kind Kynd of Jinxland, so the name Prince Kynd was probably not created independently.) MGM bought the rights to both this film and the musical, resulting in the use of the poppy field snowstorm (from the play), and the all-a-dream and farmhands-to-companions elements of the MGM film.
A large portion of the film was set in Kansas, with slapstick humor young and teenage audiences might find funny (I thought so when I was 14), but which quickly grows old and tedious, even if it does mix many animated effects into live action.  Once the characters, including three farmhands played by Larry Semon, Oliver Hardy, and Spencer Bell, with Uncle Henry and Dorothy (Dwan--Semon's wife), get to Oz--we are treated to elbaorate production design and a lot of fleeing from lions.  Bell is billed as G. Howe Black and is the only farmhand named, and it's ""Snowball"" at that.  The film is not racist enough to stand out during its time period, but at least we have the consolation that in some scenes, Bell's character appears to be brighter than Semon's (though one can't say the same for the unfortunate shots of some unbilled black children in the Emerald City).  He is a coward who spends much of the film in a lion suit, while Hardy creates an ominous image, even with Semon's silly costume design, as a Tin Woodsman [sic] who comes out of a tin pile brandishing axe, becomes the heartless Knight of the Garter, thus they do not in any way contravene what they believe about themselves, as LFB intended.  Also on board with Dorothy is obese Uncle Henry (Frank Alexander), an even nastier man than Hardy, who is not really Dorothy's uncle, who is proclaimed ""Prince of Whales"" upon arriving in the Emerald City.  Josef Swickard's performance as Prime Minister Kruel anticipates that of Sam Jaffe in Josef Von Sternberg's _The Scarlet Empress_, though Jaffe improved on the characterization.
The film has amazing production design as one of its few strong points, but this silly melodrama is hampered by such things (stirking as they are) as female impersonator Frederick Ko Vert (who designed all of the costumes except for the Scarewcrow and Tin Woodman) emerging from a basket as a demonstration of the Wizard's powers, and a tacked-on concluding scene Semon trying to fly a plane with Bell on a hanging ladder crashing into a water tower (whcih leads to the all-a-dream revelation).  This unforgettable image is good at least in that contemporary technology is allowed to appear in Oz as it did in the books, something MGM made people forget.
This is a fascinating film I have watched a number of times, but it doesn't make me like it any better with subserquent viewings.  I have not seen the DVD in question.  My tape of this film has one of Rosa Rio's better organ scores for Video Yesteryear (most of them are boring, but this isn't), though VY's primitive speed correction weakens the image.
It's also worth noting this film bankrupted the studio (Chadwick) and was barely released.  After its premiere, it was not able to supply prints to theatres that had already booked it (one older Oz fan noted his disappointment as a youth when learning hs local theatre was not able to obtain a print--before he knew just how bad the film was).
Were it not for its cast or connection to a literary classic, the film would likely be unavailable today.  The film is actually pretty typical of its time, and gives us a glimpse of what big summer movies that didn't become classics looked like in the 1920s.  Like many lesser-known films of its day, it was cross-genre--an odd mix of melodrama, comedy, and adventure.
While it proved a step on the long and prolific career of Oliver Hardy, neither Semon nor Bell, who frequently appeared together, would live for long after the film (Semon 3 years, Bell 10), and Frank Joslyn Baum's biography of his father is largely a concoction due to further estrangment from his family.  Therefore, its historical interest, production design notwithstanding, not its art, is what sustains it.",1025740800,20,5750,4.768611670020121
822260,1,6304258763,"...silent films were never silent, there was always live music, be it a lone piano, a small ensemble, a theater organ, or a full orchestra at the biggest theaters, so the question of accompaniment is not merely academic.

822264,2,6304258763,"Nearly forgotten today, Larry Semon was a top comedy star during the 1920's, even rivaling Charlie Chaplin in popularity.  His downfall, late in the decade, resulted largely from disastrous business decisions compiled by  numerous personal problems. He was a creative and talented comedian, but  seemed content to reuse the same gags again and again while overspending  lavishly on his productions. THE WIZARD OF OZ displays all the virtues and  faults of Larry Semon's work.  For no good reason, Semon abandons most of  the classic Baum story and replaces it with a Ruritarian satire about  political operatives who would stop farmgirl Dorothy from taking her  rightful place as Queen of Oz (are you still with me?).  Dorothy Dwan (who  was Semon's wife) was certainly an attractive and quite talented  comedienne, but too mature to be a genuine Dorothy.  Semon and Oliver Hardy  are farmhand rivals for Dorothy's attention.  Late in the film, almost as  an afterthought, Semon disguises himself as a scarecrow and Hardy as a Tin  Man.  Semon's brief turn as the scarecrow is one of the film's best  moments, making it all the more frustrating that he didn't film the  original story.  Babe Hardy doesn't have a whole lot to do, but he still  brightens the film whenever he's onscreen.  Ironically, Keystone comedian  Charlie Murray is woefully underused in the title role. The film is an  interesting curio and the source print for this tape very good.  Unfortunately, it has a bizarre and inappropriate music track that will  drive you crazy after a while.
