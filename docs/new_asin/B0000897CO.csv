7980814,1,B0000897CO,"The. Worst. Movie. I. Have. Ever. Seen.

One star is too many.  This makes all the other bad movies I've seen look like Shakespeare.  Honestly.  There is no script, no plot, no characters, no story, no scenes, no acting, no direction.  The audio and video quality are atrocious.  Whoever financed this were utter fools.  There is the barest hint of an idea in the premise on the DVD blurb, but it is NOT executed.  There is no attempt to even tell a story.  The documentary special feature ""Burning Sand"" is almost as bad.

I really, really, really want that two hours + of my life back.",1339027200,,587,4.452830188679245
