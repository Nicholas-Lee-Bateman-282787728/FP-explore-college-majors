7856069,5,6303939252,"At the beginning Rita's brother, Rito,  arrives on the Moon.  He teamed up with Rita, and brought her and Zedd some wedding gifts.  He brought several eggs.  Those would hatch into birdlike soldiers called Tenga Warriors.  The last egg would hatch into a powerful monster called Vampirus.

As the eggs grew, Zedd and Rita used Rito as a decoy for an ambush.  Once Rito was battling the Tiger Zord and Mega Thunderzord,  a legion of monsters joined the battle.  They overpowered the Zords through shear numbers.  Destroying the Zords also left the Rangers without their powers.  Leaving Rita and Zedd free to use their monsters and Tengas to Rule the World.

The Rangers only hope was to seek the legendary creator of the Power Coins - Ninjor.  They had to cross a desert.  Battle fire.  Nearly sunk into quick sand.  Then journey into a deep cavern, which had a portal to Ninjor's Temple.

Once in the Temple Ninjor tested them.  He had be sure they didn't seek Power out of Greed or Selfishness.  Once they proved themselves, Ninjor did more than restore their powers, he enhanced them.  They could morph to Ranger forms once again, but they also had Ninja Power - Ninja outfits and masks, the same colors as their Ranger Forms.  They were also bestowed New and More Powerful Zords.

Following that they battled the Tengas in Ninja Form, with New Background Battle Music.  Then they return to Angel Grove, and use the Ninja Zords to defeat Rito.

Following that the Vampirus hatched, and was sent to destroy Ninjor and seize the Temple's Power for Zedd and Rita.  Once Rita and Zedd made the Vampirus grow, it was revealed that Ninjor could make him self grow.  Also that he could shape shift into a Mega Zord like form.  He defended the Temple nicely.  Once the Rangers arrived, and stood by Ninjor's side, the Vampirus didn't have a chance.

This mini series brought about a new chapter in the Rangers Saga. The alliance between Ninjor and Rangers would be a lasting one.  When they needed him they could call him, and he would often come when he sensed their need.",1459641600,,2068,4.648199445983379

7856075,5,6303939252,"""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: Ninja Quest"" is a couple of episodes not to miss.  The focus of these episodes are the Power Rangers' search for the Great Power.  When Rita Repulsa's brother, Rito Revolto, arrives at Zedd's castle for a permanant visit, something doesn't smell quite right.  Now the Rangers, whom are powerless to stop the evil villains, must attempt to gain the new powers of the Ninjetti.  To do so, they are given a map and sent on a quest through tretcherous terrain where they must conquer certain battles and certain villains (a.k.a. the Tengu Warriors, a wedding gift to Rita and Zedd from Rito).  Eventually, they find themselves at a loss with nowhere to go, when suddenly they end up in a large garden just outside of a  grand gate.  What's inside this gate?  Could it be the Great Powers, another puzzle for the rangers to solve, or possibly even another villain courtesy of Rito Revolto?  Buy this video to find out what challenges the Rangers face and what lies ahead for their next adventure...if there is one, that is.  Personally, I love this video because it is so modern and incorporates real people with fantasy.  Their costumes have greatly improved along with the zords, the plots are at their peak, and Rocky, Adam, and Aisha continue on with the great tradition of the Red, Black, and Yellow Rangers orginally brought to us by Jason, Zack, and Trini.  Also, though I love the Power Rangers all the same, I find it refreshing to watch a couple episodes that don't involve the slightest bit of Japanese footage (you know how you detect the footage by the slight fading of color).  Being a fan of the Power Rangers at 17, I can tell you that the Ninja phase of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers is the greatest and most realistic phase that I've come to know, with a cast who truly knows their roles.  When it comes to Power Rangers, my satisfaction is always guaranteed.",995241600,20,1902,4.655688622754491
