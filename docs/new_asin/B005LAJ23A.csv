4795211,3,B005LAJ23A,"I was looking forward to this season premier as the first season was very good albeit too short.  Unfortunately they chose to open the season with a standard clich plot.  That is, the scared kid running off, refusing to follow directions, hiding and forcing everyone else to risk their life searching for the one person they can't bear to leave behind.  This clich has been used in nearly every action TV show that has children involved.  Lassie, Flipper, Lost in Space, Battlestar Galactica (the original), to name a few.  There were a lot of different ways they could have taken this show. I was hoping the writers, having had such a long break, would be more original.  Hopefully the rest of the season will be better.",1318809600,8,721,4.682539682539683

4795486,4,B005LAJ23A,"Pretty dang good!  I was highly impressed with the first season and dove into this head first.  Its a good ride!

The actors are AMAZING.  Seriously - its not a bunch of over-saturated faces who you readily recognize from every latest flick.  They picked a great bunch for the series.  They each portray a distinct, unique character whom you can identify with.  The music and cinematography was spot on and captivating.  The moral dilemmas arising - especially between two certain people - was quite a thing to watch.

The effects were still mostly good - real makeup and prosthetics.  There was only 1 part with noticeable CGI.

That said - I got tired of the religious theme jumping up in my face every 5 minutes.  There a few moments when I wanted to turn it off.  For once - it was just plain boring - I wanted to see how the story develops and stuff, not listen to a soap box against Christians.  Second, it made a point to paint several characters as believing in God and then pulled out of the blue - dues ex Machina stuff to paint them as dumb.  But it made no sense.  Example?

Mild Spoiler Alert -
One of the faith believing people goes and cruelly snaps a bunch of chickens legs in order feed a bag full of grown chickens to a barn full of walkers.  The comment is made later how they fed them like this all the time.  Look - I grew up on a farm.  All they have on the Hershel farm is a small coup of chickens.  If you feed the whole bag to the walkers you aren't gonna have another whole bag of adult chickens the next day and the next day - but the story presumes the ""silly"" religious person feeds the walkers in this way for days on end.  No.  If you fed the chickens to the walkers - all you'd have left if chicks and they take more than a day to grow into chickens.  Its bad writing like that - which is clearly done just to try to prove the writer's viewpoint on religion - that REALLY turns me off.  I have seen people lose children and face serious crap that never whined or blamed God like the people in this show.  In fact, a good deal of the one's I know are the one's who are still standing while everyone else is breaking down.  So really - I get that the writer's have an evident viewpoint on religion, but not everyone shares those views or had those experiences.  Some of us have had the exact opposite.  So please - keep the show amazing, stop the 15 minute diatribes against faith.  Its boring!",1514505600,,2424,4.2178649237472765

4795619,1,B005LAJ23A,BUYER BEWARE  SCENES HAVE BEEN ADDED OR DELETED TO THE EPOSIDES ON THE DISCS. THEY ARE NOT AS WHEN THEY FIRST APPEARED ON TELEVISION.  My recollections of some of the episodes are not lining up with the episodes I have watched with the discs. There is material I have seen that has not been shown on the discs. I've had to go and look on the ones with the commentaries which also have reveled to me missing information which would help or unite the storyline. Plus in the first place why do you have them included with the episodes. I think they should have been somewhere else on the disc. I did not buy it for that purpose. Why do you not tell people in the description of the disc which episodes are commentaries. Why did I have to find out once they arrived? This comment also goes the same for Season 3 and Season 4.,1495065600,,821,4.256410256410256

4796367,5,B005LAJ23A,"In my honest opinion The Walking Dead, even with six seasons completed so far, remains one of the best shows on TV. Season 2 is a top three season. This show may have zombies but it's really all about the characters and their lives in this crazy post-apocalyptic world, so if you're not a big horror fan (I'm not) you'll still like this as long as you can handle some gore. It's really a drama. This is a dark show but I don't find it too heavy despite the depressing circumstances. I've re-watched most of the episodes many times. It's addictive and features great actors. Andrew Lincoln is the standout as Rick Grimes. My other favorite character first appears in this season (Spoiler: Michonne).

4796446,5,B005LAJ23A,"To me, The Walking Dead is a soap opera with zombies, and I mean that as a compliment. You really come to love the characters, get to know them, and feel devastated when they are killed off. This season has its ups and downs. For the majority of the season, Police Officer Rick Grimes and his group are living at Hershel Greene's farm. Carol's daughter goes missing and Carl gets shot. While Hershel helps Carl, everyone is out looking for Sophia. This storyline does drag on for a little while. This season introduces the love story between Glenn and Hershel's daughter, Maggie. It's crazy to see just how much the show has changed since season 2. (Season 7 just started and it feels like a completely different show now, and that's good. It keeps it interesting and fresh) Rick's best friend, Shane begins to question his leadership and becomes a threat. Soon, we learn that people are a threat now, not just zombies. This is probably one of my least favorite seasons, but it does have its moments. I would definitely recommend THE WALKING DEAD: THE COMPLETE SECOND SEASON!!!",1477699200,,1077,4.703703703703703

Rick, Dale, Darryl, T-Dog, Glenn, Maggie, Carol, Andrea, and ESPECIALLY Shane.  What a troubled, intense, torn, violent, and even caring (yes, he is that!) character.  My wife hated his guts, I loved him.  I have never seen a show that I cared more about the characters than this one.  In fact, this is the ONLY multi-season show that's EVER held my interest...and I'm not even a zombie fanatic!  Truly my favorite show of all time.  I highly recommend it!

BTW - My wife HATES Zombie movies, etc and I kept telling her how good this was.  She grudgingly gave in and watched it on a streaming service and was IMMEDIATELY HOOKED!  She's an even bigger (okay, equally big) fan than me now!",1468195200,,812,4.608391608391608

4796907,5,B005LAJ23A,"The first half of Season 2 focusing upon Rick's group living on Hershel's Farm had, perhaps, the worst plot development of this season's start, It wallowed in the mire of the Shane vs Rick over Lorrie &  Cal soap opera of which was dull & uninspiring. This was redeemed several episodes later by the startling revelation and resolution of what had happened to one of the group's youngest members, Sophia. The action picks up in the second half of Season 2 where Rick does not disappoint with his efforts to protect the group from the likes of the Jersey boys and taking one of their group back to the farm to interrogate as they see fit. This opens up to a shocking death of a character who had been grudgingly respected as "" the voice of reason ""for the group. The finale is done in spectacular walker-blazing fashion where the farm never becomes a safe place again. Also, the final few moments introduce the viewer to  Michonne and her pets along with a glimpse of the very creepy prison under the moonlight. I bought this blu ray season to complete my collection. The cover is outstanding in that the walkers seem to move menacingly toward the beholder when you shift it in your hands.",1463788800,,1188,4.546728971962617

I dragged my feet for a few weeks and then I gave in...I was desperate to purge on yet another series, so I thought I'd give it a shot...and again I was hooked! This is tastefully (no pun intended) done with excellent actors- excellent story behind said zombies that makes sense to me. These zombies aren't clawing out of their graves but have a virus that becomes active once they die naturally or not so natural (zombie bite, etc) and the government failed to contain it or is responsible for it in the first place. This will come into light soon after or in first season). Really really love this series, gimme more!",1454112000,,939,4.465116279069767

I am sure you already know what the show is about....
In case you don't It is a great show with a story line that will keep you hanging and watching for more each week.  Yes, it has zombies or as they call them, Walkers.  This isn't just another B rated zombie show though.  It is really a great dramatic series that is wonderful for both young and old. Once you watch one season you will be hooked.
As I was saying, I bought this set and another for my Sister for Christmas and she was a happy Camper!!!
If you are looking for a new show to watch I suggest you start with season one of this show and add new seasons when you can.  This is a show I will deffy own because it is one of those that you want to watch again and again and again.",1452556800,,943,3.9162303664921465

4797837,5,B005LAJ23A,"Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his crew of survivors find a safe haven while searching for the missing Sophia, but their respite only serves to highlight the divisions among the members of the group.

This season gets a lot of criticism for spending so much time on Hershels (Scott Glenn) farm, and I suppose it may have been frustrating for viewers watching in real time to keep coming back to that location week after week.  However, streaming the episodes at will eliminates the waiting, and it seemed like a good decision to give the characters some breathing space.  When they are constantly on the run, there is little room for conflict from within the group other than differences over strategy.  Allowing them a chance to settle in somewhere and believe that they may have found a place where they can make a new life allowed for some much needed character development and the appearance of fundamental differences in philosophy among the group.  And it all wrapped up with a zombie-packed finale that could rival any horror movie.",1450828800,,1034,4.8522727272727275

4797879,5,B005LAJ23A,The Walking Dead is my favorite show. That says a lot when I have had a lot of favorites shows in my life. I've been with the series since its premiere and its a little surreal to see how it has grown into such a cult phenomenon. I will say Season Two isn't the best of all the seasons and certainly one of the slowest but it does have a lot of character development. If you are fan of the show I definitely recommend reading the comic series as well. You get to see a whole other dynamic to the characters.,1450483200,,507,4.02970297029703

4798010,2,B005LAJ23A,"This is a TV series that is a part of the zombie genre. This particular one stands out because it's been around the longest and has had a couple spinoffs. The show has some interesting drama but  after a while it gets pretty boring. The drama pretty much revolves around walkers and the conflicts between the main characters. Unfortunately every episode is pretty much like this.  There is in fact so much focus on the walkers and the fighting that there is no overall plot. It isn't really clear what the characters are ever going to do to survive. No one in the group  has figured out any real long-term solutions. There's so much fixation on their personal conflicts that it isn't really clear on what's going to happen. The writers of the show keep things interesting by killing off characters that the audience really cares about. Are but these cheap tricks get old really fast.

4798588,5,B005LAJ23A,"I always think its helpful to give a little context of the reviewer. Im in my late 20s, live and work in a city with a high stress job, and have little time to watch TV so I tend to not watch shows in real-time but wait for recommendations and then get them on Amazon. And I have seen very few zombie films/TV shows if any  It is not a genre I typically seek out. But wow  I feel head over heels for this show with Season 1 and have not been able to stop watching since.

When I first heard the premise for the show  a group of survivors fighting to stay alive after the entire world has been consumed by a disease that reanimates the dead and causes them to become vicious, blood thirsty, zombies  I thought no way would I enjoy this. But after several friends kept pushing, I finally caved and watched.

The show is of course violent and gory but all of that is really second to the characters themselves who make this show so amazing. The show makes you question values, human morals, and you find yourself rooting and cheering for these people through the screen.

Season two focus on the groups attempt to find a settlement which they do at a farmhouse. We start to see other characters grow and develop like Carol, Carl, Maggie, and Glenn which I absolutely love. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time!",1440547200,,1314,4.253012048192771

4799343,5,B005LAJ23A,"How do writers keep a story about a Zombie Apocalypse going for five plus seasons? Hard  to imagine one could get much more than a two hour script from this over told scenario much less a long series. And I'm pretty much a fan of zombie flicks. But they did it and did it with a vengeance! Season one is good and very necessary to watch in order to follow your way through the following seasons. But it's not great. Season two and beyond take this whole series and turn it from a zombie feature into a great Action Drama Horror story on crack! I have finished through season 5 and i still wonder how in the world these writers could have possibly kept me so entertained and on the edge of my seat through every episode. If you weren't quite hooked with season one, give it another go with season two. This will have you begging for more and i guarantee you will be scared, excited and sometimes a little warped with every episode from then on out...and love every minute of it.",1430870400,,977,4.309782608695652

4799558,5,B005LAJ23A,"Season Two of the Walking Dead has gotten a lot of flack from viewers over time, but it improves greatly on second viewing and is actually one of the better seasons of the series. There are reasons for some of the negativity. Having gone to many boards discussing Walking Dead, I find there is a certain percentage of viewers who really want it to be an all-action show and complain every time it slows down for a bit. That's exactly what Season Two did, especially in its first half, and that generated a lot of carping.

Secondly, when you're watching any of these seasons for the first time, you're all caught up in the plot and are very tense wondering if a certain character is going to die or what will happen to the group and of course, when zombies might attack. The naturally tense mood of the show gets any viewer impatient about what is going to happen and again impatient about character development and subplots. Finally, at this point TWD was still a new show and no one knew where it was going. I confess I was one of the people who began to get disgruntled about the show when in the first half of Season 2 it started to seem like it was going to become a soap opera. The zombies were pushed to the background and it seemed to be about who was loving who, who disliked who, etc. The season eventually righted this swing, but at the time it looked problematic.

On second look after viewing the practically all-action Season One, it becomes obvious that unless there was some character development and a chance to learn who these people were, there would just be a bunch of ciphers running around waiting to be eaten. The writers did a very good job of this, bringing the central group to a relatively safe space, a farm, where the met and interacted with a new group of characters. There are really good characters with deep flaws that cloud their judgement, people who do not yet comprehend the real situation with the ""Walkers"",and the usual problems that develop in any group which eventually lead some to feel the group is ""broken"".

And that's just the beginning. The season is full of wild plot swings when a vulnerable member of the group gets lost and another gets shot, a potentially problem romance starts up, a member becomes pregnant and has serious doubts about bringing a child into this dangerous new world, and a youth taken prisoner from an unknown but hostile group creates great dissension over what to do with him. This development heightens the tension between the two male leaders of the group and also underscores the big theme of the show: the world has changed and the old rules no longer apply but there's no handbook of new rules to follow. There is a lot of substance to this and it's fascinating to follow.

Despite it's mellow and quiet reputation there are many intense events in this season with a midseason clash that almost drives everyone apart. Quiet Season Two also has a finale that includes one of the greatest zombie invasion scenes ever made. Give Season Two a chance - it's worth it.",1429401600,3,3041,4.564102564102564

  I waited to review until I watched the DVD's after reading reviews saying some episodes didn't work, there was no menu screen etc.  I have zero complaints about the DVDs I received. There is a menu screen that includes options for continuous play, to select episode, or to add commentary (for those that have it) and every one of the 13 episodes works perfectly.",1428105600,,645,4.378151260504202

4799846,5,B005LAJ23A,"Walking Dead is an excellent show - much more than a gory zombie thriller. It is more about the human psyche under extreme duress. The characters evolve more than any characters I have witnessed in most other television shows and that is the fascinating part. People change, for better or worse. The zombies are just the catalyst for that change. There is plenty of gore for zombie fans, but the story line is very well done and a good look into the foibles, as well as the goodness, of humanity.",1427328000,,496,4.522222222222222

4799985,5,B005LAJ23A,"If there has been a better TV show than Walking Dead I haven't heard of it.  This is a universe of zombies but it isn't about zombies.  WD follows a group of survivors as they struggle to live in a world destroyed.  It is about the what it takes to survive.  Morality often conflicts with reality to provide plot twists and outcomes that will make you laugh, cringe. yell and cry.  Characters you love will live and die and you will experience their emotions with them.
Amazing attention to detail keeps the universe alive and real.  Even if you are not a horror fan you should give Walking Dead a chance.  If you are a fan of the graphic novels (OK glorified comic books) you will immediate recognize character and the producers give you constant nods by recreating iconic scenes and plot lines.  I wish I could give it 10 stars.",1426636800,,830,4.450331125827814

I did clean my DVD player to no avail and other DVDs I own work fine so I'm assuming the Walking Dead disks are defective. I did get them on sale and they do play (but not very well) so I'm happy. I also seem to be the only one having this problem but I just wanted to mention it in case others end up with the same problem.

Another reviewer mentioned that the story line in season 2 kind of sucks compared to season 1. (Like an average soap opera taking place at a farm house.) So far I have to agree though I've only seen one complete disk plus one episode on disk 2. After reading the other review I know I can look forward to watching a standard soap opera story line on bad disks. But they were on sale for $18.00 so what can I say.

4800590,5,B005LAJ23A,"Zombies have never quite been a source of mainstream entertainment. They've spawned probably a hundred cult favorites over the years, but how does a B horror movie institution, in this case based on a comic book, become the highest rated show on cable TV? Why are grandmothers and grandsons alike tuning in? Because at its core, The Walking Dead, as becomes evident in Season 2, is a show about the stress of survival. At a time when myriad scenarios for the collapse of society abound, Walking Dead has struck a nerve with people of all demographics. While Season 1 did an amazing job setting the stage for the world the show inhabits, Season 2 drives the point of the series home with brutal force.

As the group is traveling, a simple mechanical problem becomes the catalyst for an entire season of pain and frustration. Carol's daughter Sophia gets lost in the woods; Carl gets shot; Shane becomes homicidal; and of course the hope of finding peace at Hershel's farm is only an illusion. This season shows a true breakdown of civilization and the behavioral expectations that go with it. As basic survival climbs to the top of the list of immediate needs, the stress of accomplishing it wears down on each character depending on his or her weaknesses. By the end of the season, tragedy has struck everyone, no matter how noble (or how pragmatic) their intentions. But our survival instinct drives us forward, regardless of the cost. Even in despair, we find strength and hope, and carry on. That message is the best way I can explain how a comic book zombie show managed to become TV's biggest phenomenon. Its success is well-deserved.",1424217600,,1639,4.77112676056338

4800677,1,B005LAJ23A,"Season 1 is just terrific, but season 2 is flat awful. In the first go 'round AMC was looking to put themselves on the map with an original series and they did a great job. Unfortunately someone decided that they needed to cut the budget for season 2 and that resulted in a season that's crippled by a lack of movement, action, or drama of any kind.

The only reason I moved on to season 3 was that the first season was so good I felt they deserved a full season's worth of mistakes. And that's what I would call this...falling down the stairs and ending up in traction after winning the lottery.

To be specific without too much spoiling the season has the characters hanging out in a rural location that is mostly safe and arguing about the sort of nonsense you would get on an average soap opera. So if you don't mind the idea of sipping a lemonade during the apocalypse this might be up your alley.

In a last ditch attempt to be fair the big twist of the season is well executed and well done so at least it ends with a bang and not the whimper it maintains otherwise.",1423785600,5,1073,4.224390243902439

4800919,5,B005LAJ23A,The best part of the Season 2 DVD is the Webisodes in the EXTRAS. I don't want to give anything away. Watch the 6 short clips without the directors talk. It will eventually make sense as you go through them. Then go back and watch them again with the directors talk on for interesting tidbits.,1421280000,,293,4.345454545454546

This does not even have MENU option, does not have option to switch from widescreen to full tv option. I have old TV, and this movie is meant to be for widescreen so the picture looks funny and stretched a little. And it does not give Closed Caption option.

Update, we now got rid of OLD TV and got flatscreen widescreen TV and smart bluray player and then DVD Menu option shows up, now I can finally watch it with subtitles for hard of hearing. I guess this DVD doesn't work with old dvd player or old Tv..",1419465600,,609,4.205128205128205

4801775,5,B005LAJ23A,"I thought this was going to be just another Zombie show..... I saw it spoken of on Fox-News and decided to give it a try. If you can get past the gore there's a story there unfolding that not just touches but ""Strike's"" home real heard for every human on the planet. It's about life, the choices people make (write-wrong, good and bad).
It give as true an example of what the author see's (and has every right to believe) the world will be in the event of a complete system Melt-Down in ours and every country. Humans are just that, human. God gave us all free-choice to decide how we want to view life and it's reason, and worth. God also left us with instructions that fewer and fewer humans take time to even look at. With this series, set In a society that has fallen apart, one see's all the choices and there reason's played out in short and long term. Do I believe in ""ZOMBI'S"", heck-no. Do I believe in the desperation of humans, and there different ways of responding to tragedy? ""Heck-Yes""! In real life I'm a paramedic of 20+ years.
I also know we live in a society that has had it so-good for so long that what-ever happens to our structure and the survival of all people will be defined by every-one's understanding of the value of life and what ""we"" rear our offspring to understand. This ""SHOW"" is well worth the time it takes to watch, but.... Not as much as reading (And Studying) the Holey Bible. After all? The show isn't real but all who endure it see that the stories in it are much like what we face on a very minute level every day with life, work, home, and simple survival....But Life, Choices, and Gods word very much are-real. I suggest Both for all. After all, how much time do any of us really have?

4801868,5,B005LAJ23A,"Few follow up programs actually get better with subsequent seasons.  The Walking Dead did and not only got better but to the point of turning a graphic novel into a best seller.  This program has seriously great writers making it better and better episode by episode.

Without spoiling anything for those half dozen people who have never heard of it or the twenty-some odd who've never watched it, it is gory in a good way, devilish in a bad way, apocalyptic in a way we have never imagined since the early years of the Cold War.  The Walking Dead is actually a thinking man's/woman's show.

Make up artists truly get to put their trade in this show.  I wouldn't be too surprised to have found our that enrollment in such courses have blossomed since this program hit the airwaves.  The work is always to notch.  Seldom do the proverbial loose ends actually show up.  In fact, one could make a very, very short list of errors.

Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus are two of the biggest bad-asses there is. However,this season is not my favorite of the bunch do to the fact that it felt more like a soap opera at times then it did a survival story but I understood that a lot of the events definitely needed to happen for the story to continue.. Overall, I'd say it was a good buy and would recommend it to any zombie fan. So, if you haven't seen it you're doing yourself a disservice.",1412640000,2,616,4.318965517241379

4802652,5,B005LAJ23A,"I have followed this series since AMC launched it and the comic books before that. I was going to give this set a four star rating but with Carl accidentally shot while the survivors searched for Carol's lost daughter Sophie and then the surprise ending, I had to bump it up to 5 stars. I don't want to give away too many spoilers, but this is the season that cements Maggie and Glen's love and introduces a major band of characters to the cast. This was also the season that infuriated Frank Darabont (the man who was primarily responsible for bringing this series to TV) because of budget cuts and he left the series. This has been a shining star for AMC's line-up. Especially now that Breaking Bad has ended and Hell on Wheels and Ad Men were disappointing. This show could potentially go on forever. And now Robert Kirkman, the writer of the comics and also an Executive Producer and writer of the scripts, is branching it off into another series pushing this one closer to the beginning of the zombie apocalypse and a different cast of characters to bring to the screen. For lovers of good televison series, this one is for you. Horror fan or not.",1407628800,,1152,4.516746411483253

4803107,5,B005LAJ23A,"The second season of THE WALKING DEAD was much maligned by many fans because of its seemingly slow pace, especially after the action packed quick out the gate start for the series in the six episode first season.  The core group of survivors, having escaped Atlanta and the destruction of the CDC, find refuge on the Greene family farm and there they sit for the bulk of the second season, as more than a few episodes go by and very little screen time given to encounters with flesh eating Walkers and a lot of time spent on personal issues, such as Lori's pregnancy, the search for Sophia, Glenn and Maggie's romance, ethical debates over what to do with Randall, Andrea's bad marksmanship,Darryl's brother issues and outsider status, and a lot of conversations about what to do next in the aftermath of the Zombie Apocalypse.

But I think from the distance of two more additional seasons, the second act of THE WALKING DEAD looks much better in retrospect, if for no other reason than to enjoy the company of some major characters who are no longer around.  And to watch for themes that would take root and flower in later seasons.

This second season truly belongs to Jon Bernthal's Shane Walsh, whose character arc from the first episode to the penultimate one is both tragic and horrifying.  Shane is a man being torn apart both emotionally and mentally; first for his love and devotion to Lori and Carl, the wife and son of his best friend, both of whom he saved and protected during the outbreak of the Zombie virus.  He is also torn over his life long friendship and love for Rick Grimes, Shane's fellow lawman and husband and father of Lori and Carl.  But worst of all, it is Shane who has come to realize just what it takes to survive in this terrible new world-something he learns the hard way in Save the Last One-but it is a truth he can't seem to make the others understand.

That this is a world where there is no room for mercy or compassion is ultimately what drives Shane off the deep end, with tragic results for everyone, but in the seasons that have come after, it is clear that Shane was right and Rick was wrong in their debate over to proceed in the wake of the Zombie Apocalypse, starting with the fate of the scavenging Randall.  This is now a world where those who cling to the old values, like Dale and Hershel, are in for a very rude awakening, that is if they survive long enough.

The slower pace of the second season did allow for some genuine character development as we get to know Glenn, Darryl, Andrea, Carol, Hershel Greene, his daughter Maggie, and Carl Grimes much better and in ways that would grow further in later seasons. Too bad the same can't be said of Sophia and Otis.  We also learn a lot about Sarah Wayne Callies's Lori Grimes, and most of it makes clear why she became one of the series most disliked characters.  Just look at her body language and facial expressions in By the Dying Fire when Rick confesses to her what happened to Shane or her babbling to Hershel after Carl is shot, to understand what I'm talking about.  Is she the only character to ever go out and wreck a car on an empty road?

And for those who complained there wasn't enough Walker action, take a another look at the encounter with the herd on the highway in the season opener, What Lies Ahead; not to mention Shane and Otis's desperate fight with the Walker mob at the high school in Save the Last One; the shootout in Triggerfinger where Rick, Glenn and Hershel are trapped in the bar by the scavengers and the gunfire makes the Walkers come a running or the finale, By the Dying Fire, when the Walker onslaught over runs the Greene farm and there is a free for all for survival.

There are the by now requisite big character deaths, but I've come to feel like they are a big cheat after we have come to care for and root for characters as they narrowly escape certain death.  Looking back, I think it would have been a better idea for Shane and Andrea to have left the farm like they discussed at one point and their characters would have been free to encounter Michonne and end up with the Governor at Woodbury, thus opening up a lot of interesting story possibilities.

The acting is terrific all round, with a special nod to Andrew Linoln's Rick, whose character is changed by the end of the season in ways he did not anticipate, and old pro Scott Wilson as Hershel Greene, a man who thinks life will just find a way to go on in the face of a horrific new reality.  And Sarah Wayne Callies does a very good job with a very negative female character, which seems to be a staple on cable dramas-just ask Anna Gunn, who played Skylar White on BREAKING BAD.

The DVD set, with its deleted scenes and episode commentary are well worth the price; and in a series with so many twists and turns, not to mention genuine loss, it's great having the set and being able to go back and savor what has come before.",1402272000,,4932,4.423841059602649

4803597,5,B005LAJ23A,I'm not huge on sci-fi and don't usually make a habit out of watching violent television shows but I love the Walking Dead.  Each season brings new characters and new twists and it's refreshing ( I kind of hate to use that word when referring to a zombie movie) to watch a show where being a main character does not mean you survive.  This really ramps up the tension across the board as you never know when a favorite character will meet his or her demise.,1396828800,,457,4.3023255813953485

4803740,1,B005LAJ23A,"After the rip-roaring success of Season 1, ""The Walking Dead"" would have been hard pressed to meet or exceed the standard set.  However, Season 2 was such an incredible let down that it almost wiped out all the goodwill, and positive buzz, the series had generated.  I know that I very nearly swore off the show after enduring 13 episodes of the most mind-numbingly boring television on the air.

  Season 2 starts with the survivors of the destruction of the CDC on the road, looking for their next sanctuary, when they encounter a swarm of walkers.  During the attempt to wait out the swarm, Carol's daughter, Sophia, gets lost.  During the initial search, Carl gets shot accidentally.  In desperation to find help for his son, Rick discovers Hershel's farm.  This promising start to the season is completely undone over the next several episodes.

  Each episode in the first half of the season consisted of:  going out to search for Sophia, not finding her, killing a couple walkers, attempts at character development that weren't even two-dimensional, and profoundly stupid, non-sensical actions by main characters.  The only parts of the season that could remotely be considered exciting were the stunning reveal at the end of the first half of the season and the major zombie battle at the end of the second half.  The rest of the season was pathetically poor attempts to add depth to the characters that came off as ways to artificially extend different story lines just to film more episodes (Season 3 would suffer from this, too).

  Part of the reason for this major backslide was that series creator, Frank Darabont, got ousted from the show after the exciting Season 1.  Glen Mazzara replaced Darabont as showrunner for Seasons 2 and 3, and can rightfully be considered 'the guy who who nearly killed the series'.  A lack of sense of pacing, characterization and plot development plagued Mazzara's tenure.  If he had not been replaced by Scott Gimple for Season 4, leading to ""The Walking Dead""'s revitalization, I predict the series would not have survived past a fifth season.  More years like Season 2 simply would not be tolerated by the fan base",1395446400,6,2163,4.884615384615385

4803745,5,B005LAJ23A,"Ok, here is my take. After television went digital I stopped watching it. I wasn't all that glued to it anyway and did not want to pay for it. I have been just fine. Thank you for your concern.

Since I got on Amazon I have done binge viewing one time before this program. I watched most seasons of the Hercule Poirot series of stories. Missed it when it originally was broadcast and it was terrific.

I like all of seasons so far. The second is my favorite and the third my least favorite. I had no interest in the whole zombie thing and said what the hell one night. The show is only partially about the zombies. It is about the people who are still people. It isn't the finest examination of life ever written but it keeps me absorbed. Also, most interactions with the dead take place in broad daylight. Who knew this much suspense existed on a sunny afternoon?

I say give it a try.",1395100800,,886,4.261904761904762

After the first season, you have a fairly good idea of who the characters are.  Its OK to focus on character development but a little goes a long way.  Also, the acting of Andrew Lincoln and the actor who plays Shane is weak - when they are reminiscing about their pasts and have a several minute monologues, their deficient acting abilities and difficulties with the southern accent is  very pronounced.  Listening to those monologues is excruciating.  I hope Season 3 has better action.

I'm not usually a fan of the zombie genre, but I decided to give this show a chance due to the hullaballoo and recommendations from friends. Season 1 was a bit slow, but it was good enough to capture my interest and push me to keep watching. I'm so glad I did! It picks up in Season 2 and continues to do so throughout. More action, more character development, more twists in the story and more gore for those who find they get squeamish at the sight of blood/guts (doesn't ruin the show at all, at least not for me).

There is a lot of extremely graphic gore; personally, I usually look away for a moment, but if you're especially sensitive to that sort of thing, steer clear. As the very cliched line on this show goes, though, it's really about the characters, making hard choices and holding on to everything good that they can as they fight for survival.

No flinching here, body parts are hacked off, zombies stuck like pigs and knifed through the eyes and cranium. Some times the fox arms and legs show a little rubberiness, but usually look very real. You may think that all this blood, guts and gore is violence for violence sake, but the drama of the plot and great acting save the day. The poor zombies get burnt up, blown up, crushed, squashed and shot. They are the background that abounds to keep the action almost continuous. You'll see.",1392422400,,758,4.793893129770993

My wife missed the granddaughters spending as much time as they used to (they are now nearly 13 and 11, respectively.) I thought well (can you hear the gears in the admirals' scheming bridge-mind going on) we bribe them with ice cream ans stuff so why not buy this. so they were spending the night and we started watching this. This show is very well done and does not leave you with that cheesy b-rated (bad) movies aftertaste (The Zombies That Ate The Taliban - oh, god, I'm a terrorist target, now.)

The second season is more evident about the zombie infestation that leaves almost no land untouched even in the ostensibly, isolated countryside with no disturbance at all. The second season gives the audience a sign of despair with whether the people could ever find a place left alone and unreachable by zombies.

We really like the show and can watch it over and over that is why we bought the series.

4804745,5,B005LAJ23A,"I'm not a big zombie movie fan.  Flicks like ""Dawn of the Dead"" were fun when I was in high school.  But lost their appeal as I got older.

On the other hand, I've remained a fan of a good sci-fi (i.e. ""Star Trek""), fantasy (i.e. ""Lord of the Rings"") or comic book hero (i.e. ""Iron Man"") flick.  And ""The Walking Dead"" is much closer to those categories than it is to the older b-movie zombie flick.

The characters are believable.  The story keeps you coming back - with plenty of cliffhangers.  The zombies aren't quite as horrifying looking, and the violence is not as gratuitous.

All-in-all an enjoyable series.",1389398400,,616,4.536363636363636
4804746,5,B005LAJ23A,"There are no spoilers in this review. This was a great season with some engaging and thrilling moments. I like the way there are many moral and ethical issues for the characters to tackle. There is this clash between characters still trying to remain true to the frameworks that shaped their lives pre- zombie apocalypse and the characters that have ""adapted"" to the changed context. In this way the show offers indirect comment on how people think and act without really considering why they do so. I guess, if you are a fan of the zombie genre you have probably seem similar scenes, especially in Dawn of the Dead (original more than the remake) where often it seems people were living a ""zombie"" existence before the apocalypse and it was the apocalypse that made them live. Anyway, there were many points in this season where I was thinking , ""Gee, what would I do in that situation."" Watch season one first and then enjoy this.",1389312000,,932,4.654545454545454

4804915,5,B005LAJ23A,"I ordered this set, ""The Walking Dead Season 2"" on Blu-Ray at the same time as I ordered the 1st & 3rd Seasons. All on Blu-Ray! After the first season's initial 6 episode trial run, the fandom was enormous! AMC heard the calls and grabbed the show for a 2nd season. The shows following is at a level of Star Trek or Star Wars in their own right. Trying to remain true to the graphic novel, Robert Kirkman has allowed the producers to make their own added material that is TV oriented. The pair is a match made in heaven!
I should first say that ALL 3 SETS OF BLU-RAYS, have arrived to me as promised. As advertised and earlier than expected! Thanks to the professionalism at Amazon, working the holiday rush was a challenge, but my product was not only before time, it was packaged well and I could see that care was taken to be sure that my sets arrived together. Sorting facilities from 2 locations. 5 Stars all the way!
As for this amazing and ground breaking series, we see a group of people from diverse backgrounds band together for a common cause. Survival. Ordinary people become soldiers. Become warriors then killers as needed. It really is on a literal level, kill or be killed or be eaten. Worse yet, become the Undead! We see the progression, or digression or people to either step up and become leaders or ego maniacs. When the world falls away, law and order are things of the past, we mutate back to primal behaviors. Even those who are leaders, lead by brutality when needed. The maniacal grow into Hitleristic shells of ""their way or no way."" All live by the weapon. Hand to hand combat does not work in a world where a hand away means a hand bitten.
This is brutal. Absolutely sadistic at times. Compassion is fleeting but very much welcome for the cherished moments they arrive. And as soon as that tender moment might come, death rears its ugly head. The living are, at times, more fearsome than the Undead. Thus far, the Governor has been the most Demonic. Merle was close, but just in it for the kicks. I think Shane was as Dale described, ""Made for this world.""
Even now, as season 3 ended, Rick is questionable in his mental stability. Can he really be a ""farmer Brown?"" No more the leader? Hmm... So far the head count has shuffled much. Those we hated at first are fan favs' now. Hey, they've earned it. Of course, we have seen up to Season 4 mid-season finale'. I really hate those! But this does offer me the time to watch all these previous episodes now in sweet Blu-Ray! Who knows what lies ahead?
If you are looking for a package to buy and either catch up, or start to find out what so many others are talking about... You must buy ""The Walking Dead Series."" Treat yourself to what real horror is!
This is ""Trekker fan"" I hope I have enlightened you to something new! What a trip!",1388793600,,2813,4.411538461538462

In this season they have to deal with herds of walkers that are traveling as well as with a member that becomes unhinged. Now they don't just have to hide from walkers but also about him an survivors who will take what little they have by force.

4805009,2,B005LAJ23A,"This season is mostly terrible, and the more I watch this one, the worse it gets.
Season 2 has a few standout moments but overall it's an entire season of nothing. After losing Darabont, who plans to write a book on how bad AMC treated him and the cast, the show began a shift of showrunners. This season is fairly weak and leaves so many open questions like why is the gun bag back (a deleted scene explains it but since it doesn't really count it's just bad writing), why does Shane murder Otis when the camera shows how close both were to escape?, is Lori unlikable here because she's terrible in the comics too?, why introduce us to Beth and her boyfriend when the season barely mentions either character's name?, why did the showrunner replacements kind of drop the thing with Daryl's ear necklace?, etc.
The new runners tend to leave threads dangling willy nilly, like Dale... ""he will be remembered in season three"" (nope) and so many filler characters are here for no reason (seriously, T Dog has a fan base YET DID NOTHING UNTIL HE DIED. REALLY.)
Anyway.. one and three are pretty good seasons though TWD is beyond a doubt one of the worst shows out there. Season four is already following the footsteps of two By becoming the 2nd worst season of the show.
Anyway... I suggest skipping two and just imagining between one and three folks got split and met etc.",1388620800,2,1368,4.5425101214574894

I started with season one and I am now watching season three. The world of the zombie virus is a gory nightmare where a few normal humans bond and/or fall in love while struggling to survive against the zombies and other humans who are not nice people.

What's replaced civilization is a brutal, blood-soaked world but what captured me as a fan is the relationships that develop between the survivors who struggle to live another day while fearing death because it means becoming one of the walking dead.  Even if a normal human escapes being eaten by the zombies, and dies a natural death, they become a zombie anyway unless ...

Season 1 was off to a slow start, but it was short and I went on to Season 2 hoping to have things start happening. Instead, the show grinds to a halt and spend most of it's time on fabricated and avoidable personal conflict.

4805584,4,B005LAJ23A,Season 2 was definitely a bit a of a low point for me but it is still leaps and bounds over most of the garbage that passes for entertainment on TV these days.,1383868800,,159,3.8484848484848486

4805662,5,B005LAJ23A,I got hooked on this show from my roommate on campus. I thought this show was dumb but then I started watching it from season three. Then I got hooked and had to find out what happened at the beginning so I bought the first and now I have the second season. I am going to end up buying the third season pretty soon. I did notice that the second season is longer than the first season so you will get four discs. The fourth disc in this season is like a special feature disc or something. Not sure because I didn't watch it.,1383436800,,523,4.038461538461538
4805663,5,B005LAJ23A,I loved the first season and this one is just as good. It was a little slow at times but it got better with every episode. Walking dead is the best show ever.,1383436800,,158,3.8181818181818183
4805664,5,B005LAJ23A,"I love Zombies, so I had to watch the first season. Now I am hooked, and it is no longer about mobile corpses. I am invested in all the characters. This season starts off like ""Nooooooooo!"" Then there is plot twist after plot twist. At the end of second season you learn nothing is sacred, no character safe, and of corse the last shot is a great teaser for season three. Bonus features had some web episodes, acting was poor, but if you want to geek out on what it was like in the begining of the out break, go for it.",1383436800,,519,4.098039215686274
4805665,5,B005LAJ23A,"Addicted.  I hope you are too!  Yes, you can come in to the fold at Season 2 and not be too lost, but, well worth it to get Season 1 and see how it all began...",1383350400,,160,3.4166666666666665

4805695,5,B005LAJ23A,"I hate zombies.  Like anything that Hollywood thinks is a easy money maker, they beat it to death with tripe, gore, and cheesy acting/story/writing where you thank the powers that the zombie is eating the retard on the screen who pollutes the gene pool with their stupidity (and secretly wish the same fate on the writers/producers for the tripe they're putting on screen).  I hate the tropes and romanticized glee that its ok to hunt/destroy zombies because its guilt free mayhem, and I hate how glossed over the psychology of the survivors becomes.  In short, I hate how zombies are typically handled in movies or tv because the writers crank out insulting and unimaginative garbage.

I give this show 5 stars and watch every season as it comes out and revisit previous seasons upon occasion.  This is zombie horror and drama, this takes all the romantic/air headed tripe out of the genre and puts fantastic story, acting, drama, direction, and effects in front of you to make you pray this sort of thing never happens.",1382832000,3,1021,4.811428571428571

I clicked on season 2+3 and gave my credit information and suddenly it said ""you can watch it now!"" I was so confused because I hadn't even chosen how I wanted them shipped to my home! Luckily, I was on Amazon! I'm old and not used to my new iPad or the ways of this advanced technology so I clicked on a customer support spot, clicked ""call me"" and my phone rang seconds after I clicked! The man took me through what I did step by step, gave me tips on ordering DVD's, and of course, fixed everything for me! He even waited each step, asked me what my screen showed, never once making me feel stupid, or at all like I was taking too long, he was awesome!

One of the scenes within the first couple of episodes that really set this apart for me was when the main character, Rick Grimes, shows a moment of compassion for one of the zombies and actually apologies to it.  He doesn't apologies for blowing it's head off, but says he is sorry that this happened to her.  Gave the show a different take on the zombie genre.",1377820800,,508,4.260416666666667

I never enjoyed zombie movies so I was surprised to find myself glued to the tv from the very first episode.

4806487,3,B005LAJ23A,"Am I the only one noticing that the original Anchor Bay DVD edition of ""The Walking Dead, Season 2"" has terrible picture quality?? I've seen only a very few reviewers mention it but I can't just overlook it here. I have several dvd and blu-ray players and tried playing these dvd discs on all of them and the quality remains the same, pretty much one of the worst of any tv shows in recent history. There is digital distortion, out of focus shots, a plethora of unnecessary grain, contrast and sharpness issues throughout all the discs and episodes. I swear to God that a 1980's VHS movie doesn't look any worse than this garbage edition of an otherwise excellent show. I don't want to get into reviewing the storyline or the season itself, cause the quality of directing, acting and flow of story had been correctly reviewed here many times over. I just wanted to express my dissatisfaction of the dvd transfer's quality. Since there are so few negative reviews here regards to that, it almost makes me feel like I must have picked up a defective set.

4806489,1,B005LAJ23A,I'm clearly in the minority of opinions but I am struggling through Season 2.  The first season was exiting and fun but the second season concentrates on the characters which should enrich the show but the endless meandering of all the characters and the horrible dialogue has the opposit effect.  I just can't seem to care about any of the characters.  I think the series has been poorly cast except for the talented Scott Wilson.  I have a couple of more shows left of Season 2 and will hope for the best.,1377129600,4,507,4.478260869565218
4806490,5,B005LAJ23A,"My husband and I caught onto this show late, after hearing about it from all of our friends on social media websites. We caught up on the first season, and had to buy the second season. Zombie apocalypse movies and shows are very popular right now, and this one reminds me of the movie ""28 Days Later"" the way the main character wakes up from a coma to find the world infected with zombies. This series somehow seams more realistic and down to earth than the zombie movies I've seen. Since it is a series, instead of a movie, you get to see the daily struggles humanity would face should this far-fetched scenario take place. There are very few shows that my husband and I BOTH like to watch, and this is one of them. If you haven't seen this show yet, you don't know what you are missing.",1377043200,,789,4.302013422818792
4806491,5,B005LAJ23A,"I don't like zombies! I don't like them in comedies (i.e Shaun of the Dead), I don't like them in pseudo-psychological thrillers (i.e. 28 Days Later) and I certainly didn't like them on Prime Time TV, but I am a fan of Norman Reedus (before he shot to superstardom as Daryl Dixon) and I had been hounded by friends and family to check out this show. A friend lent me the first two seasons on DVD and after one very long week where I think I slept with my bedroom door locked every night, I got through both seasons and found....I wanted more. Even if you aren't a fan of the horror genre, this show is for you. I learned very quickly that The Walking Dead is not a show about zombies - sure there a LOT of zombies - but about what happens to people when the world goes to crap and all you have left are a few individuals fighting for a small slice of life during a difficult situation.

Don't get me wrong, this is no ""Shawshank Redemption"" but it is great. So much so that I am now a lifelong fan and can't wait until season 4 starts in October.",1377043200,,1046,4.127450980392157

4806504,1,B005LAJ23A,"The first season was intriguing, and I understood its analogy of our contemporary mindlessness. It's focus on pure survivalism was attractive for the masses because that animalistic instinct is all our world has left, in general and for consolation; our best solution for nihilism, itself birthed by liberalism, is to stare the devil in the face. That is a bitter pill. The show doesn't ever knowingly approach such insight, it just nicely imitated our mood.

Darabont was fired for financial reasons, of course. Not surprisingly, the show then started to really suck. It is now preoccupied with moralizing wish-fulfillment and campy melodrama. The writing and acting we're both mediocre from the beginning, so real profundity should be off-limits. Now Dead is making proclamations about man, death and the Sacred, and its embarrassing to watch.

All the characters undergo a developmental downward spiral, Daryl especially. Frankly, I was offended by their contrived innocence. There's all sorts of sudden, anomalous outbursts, many indirectly engineered by the pathetic plot and its impossible discrepancies. Others are resultant of the show's own liberal anxieties about unreconstructed white men. The 'love' between Glenn and the farm girl, which was so calculated, served no purpose besides blatant social-engineering. Yet, so is the character of Shane, who becomes so glaring so as to make the emotive, empathic old man and protagonist so much more purposeful. And so Is the entire situation surrounding and including Herschel, that old-time white man who couldn't possibly eat sushi. I cringed every time he said ""the Asian boy"", not for the reason AMC would like me to think but because they were so obviously reaching in my brain under the direction of NPR.",1376870400,7,1766,5.303571428571429

But I love it for the arguments it makes for each character's different approaches to the apocalypse. I found I really got caught up in the characters again, and in the hard choices each one was having to make. I think it is a real dramatic tour de force.",1376784000,,333,4.21875

I love this show and season 2 is also awesome as the first season just thankfully longer! Daryl Dixon has to be my favorite character and I guess Rick would be second. I love everything about this show except for one thing.....SHANE!  That man really gets on my nerves!

4806508,5,B005LAJ23A,"The last fifteen minutes where Shane gives his speech remains THE best thing about this show.

I want it as my ringtone:

""These things ain't sick! They're not people. They're dead! Ain't gotta feel nothing for them cos you know what they do? They kill. These things right here. They're the things that killed Amy, they killed Otis! They're gonna kill all of us unless we do something. Hey, Hershel, man, let me ask you something. Could a living, breathing person, could they walk away from this? Three rounds in the chest! Someone's who's alive, could they just take that? Why is it still coming!  That's its heart, its lungs! WHY'S IT STILL COMING! Yeah, you're right man, that is enough... Enough, risking our lives for a little girl who's GONE! Enough, living next to a barn full of things that are trying to kill us! ENOUGH! Rick, it ain't like it was before! Now if you all wanna live, if you wanna survive, you gotta fight for it, and I'm talking about fight! Right here, right now!"" -Shane, 2.07 (Pretty Much Dead Already)

It is a rallying call to do something about evil in this world.  To not wuss out, to not be an ostrich.

4806607,5,B005LAJ23A,"if your into great drama, acting, story telling, suspense and of course, last but not least , zombies this show reigns supreme.
Their are some people who will never ever give this show a chance just because of the zombies, or will this show ever receive any Emmy Awards because of the walkers, but as far as I am concerned who cares, the ratings speak for themselves, and these people don't know what their missing , so "" F "" them.
This show is a drama first and horror TV series second. I thought the first 2 seasons were brilliant, and their wasn't to me 1 boring episode. Just seeing the individual characters slowly changing from episode to episode was interesting to me.
Some people or so-called fans of the show endlessly complain about season 2 on the farm being boring, these people seem to be more horror or action fans and must see 100% gore in every episode or they are just not happy. My suggestion to them is to go to the movies and watch Evil Dead, the horrible World War Z or whatever other rubbish Hollywood continues to crank out and pump millions of dollars into which virtually lack any story what so ever and are only made to create more CGI effects to hide the fact that THERE IS NO STORY.
I must admit that season 3 was only about 80% great and seemed to loose its way here and there, but now that they have a new show runner, Scott Gimple who wrote some of the best episodes in season 3, and after seeing TWD panel and a preview of season 4 at the 2013 Comicon convention I have total faith the show will be better than ever except for of coarse the constant complainers who endlessly blog about how bad the show has become but for some reason can't stop watching it.
Oh by the way, here's another suggestion, if you don't like the show then stop watching it, and shut the ""F"" up, or just stick to the comic book which this show does not follow and stop expecting it to be like the comic books.

Recommended to Walking Dead TV series or comics fan.
I can't wait to have the Third Season special edition.",1373846400,,154,4.961538461538462
4806821,5,B005LAJ23A,"I held off watching this series because I was tired of seeing zombie movies and shows. I purchased season 1 & 2 at the same time and watched them over the weekend. I really like this show, very well done, and it kinda makes you think, what would you do in a similar situation. Overall, good show, like it alot.",1373846400,,310,4.183333333333334
4806822,5,B005LAJ23A,"so once again not going to review the season, thats not the reason for this. just what we get for buying this set. First off, i'm still extremely upset at how damn expensive it is to buy a season of the walking dead. the first season sold for i believe 30 dollars...can you believe that? for just 6 episodes and very little features in my opinion. now season two has been out for some time and it ranges between $30 to $40 heck even bestbuy has it at 49.99. for what? 13 episodes? that is just too much. anyway back to the product.

Languages: English TrueHD 7.1 and French dolby surround 2.0. this series should have more than just two audio language options for the damn price they are charging. besides in the USA, spanish is the second biggest language, not french. so wth is french language the only other option for audio?

subtitles: english for deaf and hearing impaired, spanish subs.

bonus features: there are 11 bonus featurettes, most of which range from 3mins to around 10min i believe. most are short around 5minutes though. there are 6 webisodes which i actually liked. remember from season 1 ep 2 i believe when Rick gets out of the hospital and sees a bike he uses? and he sees that walker with no legs? well we find out who that walker was with these webisodes. sad story.
there are audio commentaries for episodes 1,7,8,11 and 13. the deleted scenes are for the most part lackluster, BUT the very first deleted scene for the season was an awesome scene that i think should of been added to the episode. its actually the longest deleted scene coming in at almost 14min long. remember in season one where those gangs captured glen? and they got glen back and found out the gangs were actually decent men taking care for the elderly? WELL, we go back to that site and find out whats been going on there since we last saw them in season one. i thought that was brilliant!

anyway, thats all for season 2 extras. honestly i would go to ee - bai to get this set, because i got it used for $20 in excellent condition thats with shipping. no way am i paying 30 odd dollars for a 13 episode season.",1373673600,,2109,4.4
4806853,5,B005LAJ23A,"This is perhaps the best television series i have ever  watched.  The blu ray makes it ever better with master high definition picture quality and sound.

4806857,5,B005LAJ23A,I absolutely love this cable TV production.  I have the first season and am looking forward to acquiring the second season.  This show is not all about zombies as much as it is about how the characters interact with each other.  It is about how they get along.  It has been hard to see a few of the characters get killed but there are new people coming into the show all the time.,1373241600,,380,4.164383561643835

4806861,5,B005LAJ23A,This show is a bit too much on the gross factor but I'm still watching because of the great writing and character development. I can honestly say its one of the best shows on tv.,1373155200,,178,4.114285714285714
4806862,2,B005LAJ23A,I was disappointed in night time shooting of so many episodes in season two.. it was very hard to see any thing during these episodes.,1373155200,,134,4.4
4806992,5,B005LAJ23A,This show is sooooo amazing! It more that the zombies...it's the characters in the group and everything they go through....alll their struggles to survive in the world and with one another. I LOVE it! My favorite character is Daryl Dixon.....who is sooo scarred from life inside out and his character is very related to other people who have gone through similiar situations...you can't help but love this character.,1373068800,,416,5.132352941176471
4806993,5,B005LAJ23A,"I was completely hooked by the previous season, but this one is even better. The story starts showing more complexity when now it's not only a matter of surviving the walkers, but also the conflicts among the living are taken to the next level. As the group led by Rick leaves Atlanta, we get huge amounts of thrills, a bunch of gruesome scenes and an enthralling story line.

I am pretty much unable to stop watching these, I am already into season 3 and looking into getting the graphic novels so I can see ahead in what happens when the season ends. This is one of the best shows I have ever found, full stop.",1372982400,,612,4.321739130434783
4806994,5,B005LAJ23A,"I am a huge fan of this, show, and the second season is recommended to anyone that like the show, even if you were skeptical after watching the first season, buy this one, because it does get better, and it is a lot longer than the first",1372809600,,237,4.0638297872340425
4806995,5,B005LAJ23A,"Huge fan!!! Buy this.. No one has ever done a zombie series and ""broken the rules"" with involving children as zombies and action violence. The best show on TV... Warning... If you start this show you will not be able to stop...",1372723200,,227,4.428571428571429
4806996,5,B005LAJ23A,This is the best show ever. The 16 episodes are great and there is bounus tracks and deleted scenes. I am very pleased with this dvd set and can not wait for season 3 to come out.,1372636800,,179,3.864864864864865

4806998,4,B005LAJ23A,"I wasn't sure about this show after the first season.  It is very suspenseful to the point of inducing anxiety and the characters were not necessarily likable.  However, the second season does a good job with the development of the characters, so that one becomes invested in them.  It is very gory, but of course that is appropriate given he subject matter.  I would not recommend this for anyone under 13-14.",1372636800,,410,4.732394366197183
4806999,4,B005LAJ23A,"I'm a huge and ardent fan of the show.  I didn't think I would be, at first, because on the surface, the plot seems to be ""a million and one ways to kill a zombie"".  But... that's not it.  At all.

The show is about how very ordinary people will change when given only three choices: live, die, or become a mindless killer.  There is absolutely no gray area in between those three states of being.  It's about how they deal with their own changes and the changes of their friends, family, loved ones, enemies, and other previously ordinary strangers.

And, that being the case, I found I didn't need to pay for the HD version.  I get all that and more from SD resolution.",1372464000,,671,4.312
4807000,3,B005LAJ23A,The first season had nice direction and storyline going. That all goes to shit the second season. Overhyped and overrated. The storyline gets drawn out and development is slow. Seriously awful second season.,1372377600,,207,5.303030303030303
4807001,4,B005LAJ23A,"I'm not at all a fan of Night of the Living Dead, 28 Weeks Later or any other zombie movie.  It took me several seasons to finally give this show a chance and I've been binge viewing for the last 2 weeks!  Admittedly, it took me the first two episodes to get used to seeing the ""walkers"" but once I got passed that, I've been rewarded episode after episode with a show that challenges your view of this world.  At the core of the program is a reflection of what we experience every day - hope, compassion, fear, conviction, revenge, love.  Strip the world of all it's conveniences and see what's left of humanity. I just watched episode 7 of Season 2 ""Pretty Much Dead Already"".  That episode is what got me to write this review. I'm still processing the last 10 minutes of that episode.  This show is so well done from the casting, setting, makeup. It delivers on so many levels.  I'm just sorry I didn't start watching it sooner!",1372377600,,931,4.377906976744186

Just like all the major network shows you can predict what happens next- be it zombies, dinosaurs, aliens, or whatever is plaguing earth, the script, characters, and ""drama"" are basically the same.

The story lines are interesting, the acting is fabulous and the action is intense. And keep that in mind if you have younger viewers at home...there's quite a bit of language and gore.

They can't find firearms, medicine, clothing, food, water, etc, but pass by homes and through intact towns completely abandoned.  They don't even try to find a place in which to settle down to survive, instead wander aimlessly, halfheartedly defending themselves in increasingly more incompetent ways.  Instead of clearing out an area of walkers and setting up defenses, they flee, on foot, with the cliche falling down and breaking of legs.  They've been doing this for about a year, but some of them still don't know how to shoot!  I can't watch any more.

While not staying complete true to the comic(due to transition issues) the show is able to grasp and wrestle with intense human emotion in the moment of crisis. It also portrays how quickly the human mind can be conditioned and even warped to barbaric life styles. The actors/actress play their role as if the persona was an innate part of who they really are.

Even if your not a fan of blood and gore the everyday events play out for everyone to love. Season 3 is chalk full of story instead of blunt (walker) gore.

Season two still, having most of the episodes surrounded with Darabont's signature, a very good season 2(should have been the last). By the time season two had ended it was obvious (at least to me) that Mr. Darabont had no intention of chaining himself to a television series. AMC realizing they had a core audience hungry for more ($$$) quickly moved to make 'TWD'an integral part of their fall/winter schedule. Without Frank Darabont, I'm afraid this show is as doomed as those that have crossed over, known forever more as 'walkers. Evident by (S3) the complete reconstitution of a very good mini-series that should have ended were intended, at the end of season two.",1367107200,,793,4.925373134328358

4807750,3,B005LAJ23A,"i watched this whole season in one night. because i soon realized i could fast forward through the dialogue and miss nearly nothing except being annoyed be tedious, repetitive dialogue.

nearly every single exchange can be summed up as some variation of, let's us two walk a little away from the group so i can say,

""i can't bear any longer this depressing, horrific reality!""
"" you need to keep fighting! for the group! for the children! for the future!""

aaaand repeat this several times, slightly rephrased each time, while melodramatically emoting...then wander back to the group. and usually while people are distracted by inane dialogue like this, a kid or someone wanders away and stumbles into a zombie, even though by this time, anyone who isn't on their guard against zombies deserves to stupidly die, so we just laugh.

one exchange that had me groaning was when the blonde chick wanted her gun, but the white beard dude wouldn't give it to her. this was when i realized that the dialogue was inane, plodding, irritating repetition. she says,
""i want my gun.""
""i don't think that's a good idea.""
""it's my choice if i want to die.""
""but i feel like you shouldn't.""
""but it's my choice if i want to.""
""but i feel like you shouldn't.""
""but it's my choice if i want to.""
""but i feel like you shouldn't.""
""but it's my choice if i want to.""
""but i feel like you shouldn't."" ""
""but it's my choice if i want to.""
""but i feel like you shouldn't""

aaaaand scene! of course this dialogue is phrased slightly differently each time, and spoken in varying tones of softness and loudness, but that is essentially the extent to which it moves the plot forward.

then there's the episode where the precious kid of whom his parents are supposedly devotedly protective, spends the entire episode wandering alone and all over the place...unprotected into the woods to face a zombie alone, then stumbles upon one ""private"" grown-up moment after another, without any organized system of watching or protecting him. this defies belief.

then....SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!

when the white beard dude finally buys it, it's because, of course, he has wandered off into the dark field alone, and when he finds a mutilated cow, he doesn't look around for danger, he just stares at it dumbly, then of course, despite the fact that he is out in an open field alone, and has been alerted to something violent having happened, the zombie nevertheless is able to just step in from off camera (if someone is off camera, then of course the person who is on camera cannot see hear or sense their presence until they leap noisily into view of the camera. then having been so unbelievably stupid, even after all the time they've had to get used to zombie attacks, we don't feel a thing for the idiot who has just stupidly caused his own death.

those are just 2 of the most memorably stupid moments in season 2.

however, when the action directors take over, and a big zombie attack is underway, and there's no time for annoyingly stupid dialogue, this show really shines.

and there were also 2 good memorable plot moments..... SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!!

when we think the fat guy sacrificed himself - but then it's revealed that he was actually killed by the other guy - that was actually a cool twist.

and when the two strangers came into the bar and there was a classic western-type showdown with the tension building as you realize that these 2 starngers are the opposite of friendly even as the act polite...there's 2 good moments. but unlike the 2 lame moments i described, there aren't lots more like that....there's just lots and lots of the annoying repetition of....

""i can't bear any longer this depressing and horrific reality""
""you need to keep fighting! for the group! for the children! for the future!""

also the old predictable standby of,

""let me tell you a fond nostalgic story"".

Some of them are interminable. The story just stops dead in its tracks, and these scenes are totally expendable.

 Too bad they didn't make the Shane character more likeable. Eventually, you find yourself looking forward to his biting the big one, one way or another. How much more interesting it would have been to have made him a more sympathetic character, instead of the sleeze ball he turned out to be. The old guy named Hershel is another one who's grating on the nerves. His tone of voice is pretty annoying. Too bad he survives all three seasons. And don't get me started on Andrea.

4807827,5,B005LAJ23A,"If you are not watching the Walking Dead, I don't know what to tell you. I know, I know, ""who wants to see a show about zombies"" that's what I got from a friend of mine who I twisted her arm literally to watch and now she is ""crack whore addicted-not literally of course"" to this phenomenon. It's much more than a ""Zombie"" show, it's about human nature, survival, trust, love, betrayal, pain, loss, sure it's set in a surreal world. But how surreal could it be? This show is about a journey to survive and what would it take if you really wanted to live and fight. The cast is amazing and the writing is superb.

4807972,5,B005LAJ23A,"This is my favorite show. It has all the shock value of an HBO series but without all the nudity. Still, it has wonderful writers that keep the main storylines from the graphic novels while creating a new version for the series. It keeps readers like me glued to the television not knowing what will happen next. Will it be like the novels or will something new and exciting happen? I love not knowing what is in store for our poor tortured group. I love the addition of new characters like Darryl that keep the show interesting. Not into zombies? Well, the show is much more than just zombies. It has a wide range for anyone that likes drama ad suspense! Completely recommend to anyone!!!!",1365724800,,690,4.528
4807973,4,B005LAJ23A,"Overall this season was great.  It keeps you on the edge of your seat and is well done from the standpoint of a piece of television too with acting, sets, etc.

The good of this season is we're back on the road again with more zombies!  Every minute is still about staying alive and how the 'group' manages to do this (or not at times, there are of course many deaths).  An assortment of new characters are brought it and how that clashes with the already existing folks.

I will say that the start of the season spent out searching grew a bit tiring after a few episodes.  I understand they were trying to stay true to the comics, but sometimes things don't translate well from one medium to the next.  There's a reason anytime print media is turned into film that something is removed or added.  I wish this could have been shortened but it wasn't too terrible.

As a positive note - the second half of the season got much better.  I will try not to have too many spoilers, but Dale really brings it home by stressing to the group about losing their humanity.  I think this is the epitome of the season and emphasizes the show is about people and not zombies.

Overall a great season and I'd recommend it to anyone.",1365552000,,1217,4.336283185840708

4807977,5,B005LAJ23A,"The Walking Dead season two was another amazing 5 star season with many twist and turns make you guess what the producers will do next for the storylines.  I will give the highlights of the season (some spoilers) for fans of the show or people who have yet to watch the show but wonder about it and might want to buy the show.  The first show shows how family, friends, and people you care about stay together and live on even though walkers all around the area.  The second they get medical attention for Rick's son...another character will die if doesn't get medical treatment T-Dogg.  On the thrid show you still have the group looking for Sofia and Shane comes back with supplies.  Fourth show they have to close off a well because of walker inside it.  Show Five you have some of the chacters thinking back before the world of walkers, Darrel gets injured and walkers attack him, then Glenn finds a surpise in the barn.  Show Six the truth comes out and Rick finds out his wife is pregant.  Show Seven Glenn tells the group about the barn, Shane takes the guns from Dale and goes to the barn, Rick and group frozen when they see what comes out of the barn,  Rick makes a hard choice and shoots.  One of the actors on True Blood guest stars in a scene in Show Eight.  Show Nine tensions getting bigger between Rick and Shane looks like there is going to be a showdown between the two of them sooner or later.  Show Ten Rick and Shane have there fight and end up being attack by walkers and you choice if you really want to live or die.  Show Eleven Rick's son doesn't believe in Heaven when talking back to one of the characters about Sofia, Dale leaves the house after a choice was made he didn't like and finds a dead animal and then attack by a walker, Darrel makes a hard choice for the dying Dale.  Show Tweleve the group reenforces the farm to protect it from walkers and any other dangers, Shane, Rick, Glenn and Darrel go try to find the escape prisoner Randell only to have Darrel find him with a broken neck.  Then Shane pulls a gun on Rick for final showdown Rick tries to talk sense into him but can't so has to get rid of Shane somehow.  Then the Final show of season Walkers make it to the farm, The group realizes the farm is no more and burns the barn to try get out of the farm and live on.  Then Rick tells the group the truth he has kept secret since season one (to find out you have to buy season two).  Plus Rick tells Laurie the truth about him and Shane, and what Carl did to Shane afterwards.  Great Special Features about the music of the seaon, make up amazing job on that, plus almost 30 minutes of delated scenes to add to the storylines.  Also for myself I enjoy how much they stay close to the comic book overall.  I truly enjoy this show and it's one of my girlfriend's favorite show currently.",1365379200,,2829,4.260299625468165
4807978,4,B005LAJ23A,"These are the farm episodes of the walking dead. not much happens. The blu-ray looks fantastic and has some interesting features. If you can find it for the right price, I would definately pick it up.",1365379200,,200,4.583333333333333
4807979,5,B005LAJ23A,I heard about The Walking Dead series from Halloween event based on the tv series at Universal Studios Hollywood. I saw the previews on the tram and wanted to know what all the fuss was about. Let me tell you- AMAZING series! I purchased First Season and watched it all in one weekend. I knew I was addicted. The Walking Dead Season 2 is just as addicting... if you haven't jumped on the band wagon.... NOW is the time!,1365379200,,419,4.3164556962025316
4807980,5,B005LAJ23A,"I am a huge Walking Dead fan and this season did not dissapoint. I just hate waiting so long for the next season. Would definately recommend to any Walking Dead, Sci Fi, Zombie, Action, Blood n Gore fans out there!",1365379200,,214,4.375
4808031,5,B005LAJ23A,Started just where season 1 left off.  My son loves the zombies.  It is really well written and keeps your attention,1365292800,,116,4.476190476190476
4808032,2,B005LAJ23A,"Season 2 was a severe disappointment after the mostly focused story-line of season 1. I'm not a fan of horror or zombies in particular, but I wanted to watch the show because I do like the post-apocalypse genre. To be clear, I expected a lot of drama before I began watching season; but drama is only good when it makes sense. The short version of why I didn't like season 2 is this: the characters are all over the place. Maybe two or three are well-written and don't do things that make no sense, but there rest are just vessels through which the writers of the show like to squeeze out as much melodrama as possible, irritating me in the process.

From about episode 2 on, I was bored. I don't need action to keep me paying attention, I need a focused narrative, and characters that do and say things that make sense...for their character. For the most part, it seemed to me that whenever the writers didn't know what to do, they would just have a character do something stupid, which would create a problem that doesn't add anything to the story. And that's how most of season 2 felt. Like there were two or maybe three things that were driving the story forward, and everything in between was just filler. I think it was seven or eight episodes in and the Sophia being lost in the woods story arc hadn't even been finished. By that point it seemed like her mom had already moved on, and didn't particularly care about finding her. Sure...I mean whatever. If she's not going to care, I don't care.

And that's how I felt even throughout season 1. I don't particularly feel attached to any of the characters. Glenn is probably the strongest character, and the one whom doesn't do very many things that don't make sense. But I'm watching each episode just kind of passing the time, being bored through most of the drama because almost nothing happens in most of the episodes. We have to drive five minutes into town to go get Herschel, we'll be right back. Cool. Five hours later, the short trip has inevitably been turned into the entire episode, and then the pregnant woman decides to go off to rescue them on her own because obviously whatever is holding them up is something she can deal with. But of course she crashes her car, thus creating even more drama. And I'm sitting there just like...who cares? I don't care about any of these people because none of them are consistent. In a survival story you have to care about the people who are trying to survive. But everything is just a long argument that ultimately never gets resolved.

I'm not saying that everyone should just work together happily. No doubt in a real-world scenario people would argue with each other and there would be drama. But I don't need eleven episodes of it. The Walking Dead is about a zombie apocalypse, but it shouldn't be about a zombie apocalypse. It should be about what comes after. How people collectively can regroup and decide how best to try to live. There are morality questions that are amateurishly addressed. The show should be poignant, offering up questions without actually having to ask them, and making the viewer wonder not just how they would feel in that characters' place, but about their own morality in the world we actually live in. These are things that have been awkwardly handled so far, and if I'm going to keep watching it needs to change.

That said, another problem is some of the casting choices. Carl, the main protagonist's son, is horrible. Excuse the pun, but he can't act to save his life. And it doesn't help that whomever is writing the dialog for him clearly has no idea how an actual 13 year old speaks. Many (I'd say most) shows suffer from this, and it's not easy writing dialog for a very young person, but if that's the case his dialog should be kept to a minimum. It's laughably bad, and he ruins almost every scene he speaks in. I guess he's really the only actor I have a problem with, the rest I can chalk up just to the sub-par writing.

All that negativity said, the season had a few high points. Without spoiling anything, it is finally revealed what Jenner told Rick before they left the CDC, and the Sophia story-line was completed in a way that made me respect the show more, though by that point I was extremely bored and irritated at all the pointless bickering. I can only hope season 3 is better. If it's not, I won't continue watching.",1365292800,,4383,4.522068095838588

I don't know what these other people are talking about when it comes to 'poor quality'... he is fine! The detail is great which makes this a genuine creepy fixture to my movie shelf.

It's limited, it's cool.  People comment on it when they see it.  It scares the crap out of you when you forget it's there sometimes.  My wife still hasn't adjusted ;).

I love it, so much so that I have every intention of rewatching the first season and I am sure my opinion will be much different the second time around?

I don't feel as if the writers are just going for the shock factor in this season, although it is certainly there!  Character development is also very strong in this season and the plot constantly leaves you wanting more! Rick and the rest of his gang are certainly intriguing, but so are the undead.  We are hooked and as season three is currently on air and drawing to a close I will by buying that one too and eagerly waiting for season four.",1364428800,,772,4.238095238095238

4808353,5,B005LAJ23A,"I discovered Walking Dead in the third season. I thought that it couldn't possibly be a show that I would like. Was I ever wrong! (I am a Downton Abbey, Jane Austen, Masterpiece Theater, Homeland, and The Good Wife type of fan.) This show is not just about blood and gore. It's more about people, relationships, hope, endurance, survival, and faith. I bought Season 1 and Season 2 to catch up and get all the back histories of the characters and situations. It's incredible. I watch it on my Kindle when I am working out at the gym, and it keeps me going for at least 45 minutes on the elliptical. The biggest problem is that I embarrass myself by gasping and covering my mouth involuntarily while at the gym. (It is scary!) I highly recommend this show, and it is great watching it on my Kindle.",1364169600,,796,4.421768707482993

4808357,4,B005LAJ23A,"That's not just a terrible pun; so far, season 2 is the best. The raw energy of Shane and Rick constantly butting heads, Darryl trying to tame his loner personality, Herschel trying to understand the walker plague in the face of his spirituality and religion, Glenn and Maggie making googly eyes and the constant game of, How the Hell Did Carl Get Out of the House Again?!

The season suffers from being overlong and from sacrificing some characters' true motivations just to create manufactured conflict. Also, the dialogue can drift into Days of Our Lives territory.

But still, look at that zombie head! The screwdriver comes out and actually kind of works as a key to open the DVD set. You HAVE to stick it in his eye to get it open!

So HEAD on out and pick one up! Wait, that doesn't work.",1364083200,,795,4.506944444444445

By the way, you can stream the first 2 seasons of the show on Netflix. No other provider is licensed to stream it right now. In other words you can't see the show on Hulu.

The writing is still good and the characters still very believable. The gang is now hiding out on a farm owned by a doctor who lives there with his two daughters. Conflicts arise and the group spends a lot of time fighting each other as well as others out in the world- ones who aren't zombies or ""walkers."" Of course there are plenty of walkers to contend with here and they are still scary as heck! But this second season is also great for the same reasons that the first season was so cool. Beware there is even more blood and gore in this season. The show is starting to remind me an awful lot of ""LOST"" only on a Georgia farm instead of on an island and instead of Others we have Walkers... Just a thought!",1362873600,,833,4.2784810126582276

Characters are fun, provides good scares and plenty of armchair second-guessing when the characters make judgement errors (this happens quite often).

Show is very gory, so I don't think suitable for kids or those that are squeamish. Thematically, it can get a bit redundant, but overall it's a lot of fun and once you start watching it rally sucks you in. Overall, great show!",1362441600,,593,4.747572815533981

4808799,5,B005LAJ23A,Great Show. I'M totally hooked. Bought This On Amazon. Quick Shipping. Can't Wait For Season 3.  It Has Me Addicted On Buying Gerber Gear!,1362268800,,138,4.75

4808872,5,B005LAJ23A,This collection was $100 everywhere we looked but here on amazon it was only $50 ... What steal! We bought one right away it had only been out maybe a month or 2 at the time and it was worth it! We are both big fans of the show and could not pass this up!,1362182400,,255,3.6545454545454548

4808874,5,B005LAJ23A,I first was turned on to this series by a friend and did not start watching till season 3. I was instantly hooked and bought season 1 and now season 2 on Blu-Ray. I was hooked by the characters and love how gross and real the zombies looked and acted when killing or being killed. I love the extras on the discs showing how the show is made and filmed. I have only seen the extras on the season 1 discs but expect more of the same from season 2. Like others have reviewed Season 2 starts off slow but gets better. Just something that's necessary to build each character. That's what makes this show so good is the characters. My wife and others make fun of me for watching this because they just don't get it. All they see is the blood and guts and think that's all there is to it. They can't watch it long enough to get into the characters. Of course I make fun of her for watching every version of the real housewives... YUck! Buy this you will not be disappointed. Amazon had the best price I found and free shipping that made it her several days B4 it was expected.,1362182400,,1069,4.169082125603865

4808876,2,B005LAJ23A,"This is a horrible disappointment for me. I wanted to watch an excellent show in it's second season and what I got instead was a terrible show that couldn't figure out what it wanted to do with it's self. It spent most of it's time in a place that wasn't nearly as prominent in the books,and then had it's main character at the end of the season completely change. You may like this show regardless of how poorly it is done but I am not watching it any longer and am certainly not paying to watch it ever again.",1362096000,,511,4.171717171717172

I avoided this show until now.  I finally caved while my son was on leave from the Army and we couldn't stop watching.  The writing and story are captivating.  It's fascinating to ponder what you would do in the same situation.  We found ourselves pausing the episodes and debating who was right/wrong, etc.  It's so hard to wait from week to week for the next show!",1362009600,,427,4.48051948051948

I think I'm an official addict.
The show isn't just blood and guts, there's basic humanity and real, emotional people and these make the show worth watching even for those of us not into creepy blood and guts kinds of things.",1361923200,,578,4.043859649122807

4808933,5,B005LAJ23A,A worthy expense of time.  This series just gets better and better.  You'd think it would get dull after the fall of civilization.  Most zombie films just focus on the drama of the outbreak and subsequent chaos.  This deals with the savage world that emerges in the months after.  Zombie herds?  who knew?,1361923200,,305,4.660377358490566

More about an evolving group of people, thrown together after a virus created ""walkers"" or the walking dead who are on a constant mission to eat the living.  The walkers aren't the core of the plot for this show though, how this diverse group of people learn to cope and find a way to contribute to the group! EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!  I accidently gave the first season a bad review.  Amazon sent me an email to comment on my last 25-30 purchases.  The comment was meant for the ""Retractable Car Charger for the Barnes and Noble Nook.  I wait every week for the next episode.

This is one of those shows that you will sacrifice a night out and a full night's sleep for just so that you can watch it during its first run (although you'll probably DVR it anyway so that you can re-watch it several times before the next episode!)",1361318400,,414,4.3076923076923075

4809256,5,B005LAJ23A,"I thought the first season was good - very good because it put characters in difficult moral dilemmas and forced them to make decisions.  It also includes great action.  Season 2 does this and much more than the first.  It's rare that part 2 of any movie or tv series is better than the first , but season 2 of the Walking Dead accomplishes just this by adding depth to the characters, posing more complex moral dilemmas, asking tougher questions based on faith, and creating more suspense.

Several themes emerge in this series, including:

SURVIVAL - what does it take to survive?  How far do you have to go?  Do you have to compromise values and principles you held in a different setting?
GROUP LEADERSHIP - when a world crumbles, who decides who leads a group of people?  What are the qualities of that leader?  And how do you decide who you can trust and who is loyal to you?
CIVILIZATION - how is a civil society defined?  Is it possible to maintain civilization as we know it hen a world crumbles?
FAMILY - how do you raise a child in a cruel world or can you?
FAITH - how much of a role does faith play in survival?  If there is a God, why would he allow the world to come to the world of the Walking Dead?  Are the characters fighting for survival acting on faith by staying alive one day at a time?

Shane argues that you have to be cutthroat to survive in this new world.  Maybe to some degree he is right - that a different set of rules apply.  But the question of whether or not a person's values and principles change in the face of more extreme behaviour in a cruel world is a different question entirely - just because a person has to be tougher in a different situation doesn't mean they don't carry the same values.

This seasons offers some answers to these complex questions and lets the audience agree or disagree. It is also filled with great action and suspense.
I never thought I'd watch a show that could match Dexter, but this show comes awefully close.",1360800000,,1980,4.354223433242507

For US, parents of two young kids with very little TV time, we have been ripping through these - sometimes 2 episodes per night, and obviously late night, past kids' bed times.  I feel I am turning into a zombie sometimes.  But I have to say, this is a quality show, where Drama and human relations are front and center.  Zombie stuff is obviously there but a clear second priority.",1360713600,,508,4.25

I discovered I could download the entire season at a very reasonable price (less than the cost of a months worth of cable) and I was hooked.

At the time The WD had not reached the status it now enjoys, but I do like zombies, so I bought it. First of all, I know that tastes vary and so I don't presume to tell others what they should or should not like. My wife does not like zombie movies and she doesn't care for The WD. Even though this show is another zombie apocalypse, a topic beat to death in recent years, I believe it has to do with the other stuff that makes it enjoyable. Yes, there is some graphic killing, gory detail, and even sex, it is the details of the lives of the survivors that keeps you watching. If you start this, you will want to follow it till it ends.

4809307,4,B005LAJ23A,"I watched the first season complete, and was hooked. I am now in the middle of the second season, and I still like the show, but I am beginning to wonder if I should not be rooting for the dead people.
  There is ALWAYS someone going off alone, either unarmed or not prepared!
  They always stop and camp in the middle of a forest, or right in the middle of a clump of destroyed cars, where it will be especially easy for dead people to just walk up to them!  How about next time you stop, it's in a K-Mart parking lot, where the dead people will have to walk 3/4 of a mile to get to you? .
  When they do go out on an expedition, they never carry more than 5 bullets, between ALL of them!
  Despite living in post apocalyptic America, they haven't bothered to stock up on guns, ammo, or gasoline, so they are perpetually on the edge of disaster, even though every city has 10 gun stores, and even Walmart carries ammo.
  Their vehicles are always breaking down, despite the fact that every car lot and RV lot in America would be filled with new, reliable vehicles, that they could just pick out and drive away in!  Why don't they stop in at La Mesa RV and drive away in a new diesel pusher, complete with washer, dryer, and full kitchen?
  They still have reservations about everyone being armed. It only takes a day of training and 500 rounds to become at least proficient, if not pretty good, at target shooting. And since the range they normally shoot at dead people is about 2 feet, it would be pretty hard for anyone to miss. EVERYONE should be carrying a gun, even the kids.
  It is also very difficult to believe that there are still herds of dead people wandering around. It would be very hard to convince me that groups of teenage boys would not be hunting them down on Saturday nights, drinking beer and making bets about who kills the youngest, oldest, cutest, and ugliest of the local group of dead people. Ya gotta have something to do on Saturday nights, and since Cable is off te air, I think walker hunting would be the new teen sport.

The writing is compelling enough so just when you want to see some zombie chase scenes, one comes along.  I would say that this is not horror in the traditional sense.  I get freaked out by horror movies, but this show does not scare me like those.  This show falls more comfortably in the drama genre.",1360368000,,470,4.4186046511627906

This was first seen when the sheriffs friend turns to a zombie without even being touched. Are you serious? Oh by the way sheriff, your wife is pregnant also. Come on. As the world turns has better stories in it than a no win like this. The human mind wants some kind of hope in their life, how do you get it with that? Almost the whole season takes place at a farm that herds zombies in a barn. Anybody know what the ammo count is? I am a zombie-olic and love any movie zombie but this is getting just plain boring.

4809580,5,B005LAJ23A,"The first season of this show was often clumsy with its unfamiliar characters, and usually focused too much on the zombie/horror aspect, which we had all seen too many times before to be much affected by ... In other words, because we didn't know much about these characters, we didn't care too much about their efforts; whether they survived or not was a matter mostly of indifference. The presentation was amazing, yes, but still, the show only showed promise; it was not a good product.

Season two is different, an amazing experience. The characters are developed in such a way, and the zombie world portrayed in such a dramatic light, that it transcends the horror genre and becomes more theater than anything. Wonderful stuff, almost Shakespearean. Some of the best writing I have ever seen for television. Brilliant acting and direction, with a superb cast. The Rick versus Shane subplot is amazing for several reasons: 1st, the anti-hero is portrayed as being superficially right, but morally wrong, so that we are led to question which is the more valuable trait in this world, the survivalist instincts Shane possesses, or the conscience of a moral man, which Rick maintains. Rick (the moralist) is consistently wrong in his decisions, yet has the favor of the group, whereas the villain of the season becomes Shane, who has nonetheless acted more heroically than any of the others. Yet in the end, who lives and who dies in this new world, and why? A wonderful paradox unfolding, very engaging to watch. The romantic triangle between Rick, Shane, and Laurie is deep in a way that puts most other television writers' efforts to shame. You have the fact that Shane is responsible for saving Rick's family again and again; without him, he would have no reason to continue on. And you have the nature of Laurie's love, a continual question. Did she love Shane or only find comfort with him? And you have Shane's love, continually disregarded throughout both seasons (as Rick declares to him at one pivotal point in the story, ""You think you love Laurie, but you don't."" The viewer, meanwhile, is not so sure.) It could even be argued in the last two episodes that the anti-hero becomes the hero only to be killed by the hero turned anti-hero. In any case, it's a very thoughtful underpinning to the whole.

I found other plot developments nearly as engaging: the vain efforts to find Sophia, the ""judge, jury, and executioner"" episode, where Rick is called on (again) to decide which is more important: the safety of the group, or the preservation of his humanity, and the whole hope issue in a world where civilization has vanished and mankind faces its ""extinction event."" This last was toyed with in the final episodes of the first season, but not nearly so well as here.

A beautiful scene unfolds in a deserted bar between Rick and another survivor that I found striking: it is impossible to tell who is acting rightly and who in the gray or the black, who the villain. Everyone and everything is mixed up here, heroes and villains, friends and enemies.

Shane soon proceeds down a path to murder Rick ostensibly ""for the good of the group"" yet does not do so, placing his weapon back in his belt at one point and raising his arms. We are given the feeling that he may not be capable of murdering his friend outright. A great scene.

Not anything to complain about here, other than I wish there was more of it. The Walking Dead seasons are too short.",1359936000,,3462,4.725165562913907

A lot of critics claimed that there needed to be more action and focus on zombies, which I don't really agree with.  Luckily, the writers managed to include a lot of action WITH character development and interaction.

The highlights are the search for Sophia, Hershel's secret and Rick's/Shane's relationship.  All of these issues continue to provide great depth and complexity to this show and really help highlight the zombie threat.  This season was ended so well, that it truly leaves the viewer wanting Season 3.  I've watched Season 2 twice now and still appreciate the nuances and deep subject matter that are touched upon.

Having viewers get to know the characters more, including the new ones. I was blown away by this series. It doesnt seem to disappoint (well, only a few people that only want action which is stupid if you ask me).

Some said too much talking,not enough action,but i disagree...i think the inside story was good. It continued to allow the audience to inter-connect with what was happening between the characters.

4809929,4,B005LAJ23A,I liked this season but Season 1 had me so addicted that I bought this season's copy on Amazon. I would suggest that if you are used to HD then spend the extra money to get it in HD because the regular copy can look like regular tv if your internet connection is slow.,1358812800,,268,3.9814814814814814

A really neat thing about this edition is that the screwdriver comes all the way out, and when you do so, it locks the head in place. When you insert the screwdriver all the way in, it has a satisfying ""pop"" that unlocks the head so that you can retrieve your discs. Totally worth the money.",1358553600,,396,4.293333333333333

4810202,5,B005LAJ23A,"When The Walking Dead first appeared on TV, I didn't bother to watch because I assumed the show was nothing more than a gore fest. Despite the excellent reviews, I didn't tune in for an episode until late in season 2 -- and i soon realized I'd been missing out on one of the best drama series in recent memory. Yes, there's plenty of gore (what else would you expect when the premise is a zombie apocalyspe?), but the show's pace and timing, acting, writing and production values are all top notch, on a par with such stalwarts as ""Lost"", ""Homeland"" or ""Breaking Bad"".
Most importantly, this is a character-driven narrative that successfully illustrates all the strengths and failings of the human condition. I've quickly grown to care about the main characters, warts and all, and perhaps this is heightened by the fact that you never know when one person or another will meet their ultimate fate. Then again, new characters are introduced all the time, each with her or her own set of intrigues and motives. Think of it as ""Lost"" without all the metaphysical ambivalence and gobbleygook, but with a lot more suspense, and with... zombies.",1358035200,,1140,4.762626262626263

4810261,5,B005LAJ23A,This show is very well done. Season one started out great and season two contiunes the trend. Movies and shows about Zombies have been done over and over but this particular series is easily the best in my opinion. It's done so well you can almost smell the corpses and you may start looking around a little more carefully after dark.,1357948800,,334,4.491803278688525

4810265,5,B005LAJ23A,This is an intense and somewhat realistic thriller.  The characters are fairly well written and the characters that die surprise you.  It helps bring you into the shock and horror of the premise.,1357862400,,195,4.878787878787879

4810267,5,B005LAJ23A,The Walking Dead series is probably one of the best shows of this year. It's got action and suspense and the storyline is very refreshing,1357862400,,137,4.52

4810320,5,B005LAJ23A,"I have been waiting all my life for a TV show to capture the thrills,and metaphoric nature of Zombie movies.the Walking Dead has done that.

I like Season two, but I don't love it. I'm behind; Season three is DVR'd, so I'll have to wait and see.

The first four episodes have action, but i just knew there was something we weren't being told.  I had questions, but the group of wanderers didn't seem the least bit curious like I was.  Then by accident the lid gets blown off the can, and, like the book you just can't put down, you will find yourself running non-stop through the rest of the episodes to see how it turns out.  Generally I think the activities and procedures we see among the group of survivors is typical of what you would do in a real-world situation, but I am constantly wondering, ""How come these people have not scrounged up a bunch of walkie-talkies so they can coordinate what they are doing?""",1357516800,,783,4.3061224489795915

4810579,5,B005LAJ23A,"I watched Season 1 and Season 2 on Netflix. This review is for both seasons and is posted on both. As a TV series, other than Friday Night Lights, I've never been so drawn into a world.

The main characters have distinct personalities.

The men:

Rick Grimes - The moral leader.
Glenn Rhee - Smart, stealthy, supporter of the team. He's accused of being weak at times but is the opposite.
Daryl Dixon - Loner. He's rough around the edges but inside has a good heart. They're in the south, so they needed a hard core redneck.
Shane Walsh - Bad ass cop, he's the one who you're never quite sure about. Friend, or foe?
Dale Horvath - The group's elder. His words of wisdom are often lost on the younger generation. Isn't that how it usually works?
Hershel Greene - Opinionated, but somewhat delusional, he thinks they're dealing with a virus for which a cure will soon be found.

The women:

Andrea - The strongest, yet at times, weakest, of the women. She contemplates suicide more than once but learns to protect herself.
Carol Peletier - The weakest of the women, she lets men abuse her, and seems clingy.
Lori Grimes - The unofficial ""First Lady"" of the group. She's at times mother, at other times confidant to the women, at other times supporter of the men.
Maggie Greene - Farm girl who falls for Glenn. She lives in Hershel's dream world until reality jolts her.

I've read a number of the 2-star reviews (as I never read the 1-star ones) and most of them focus on how ""we've seen this all before"" or the plot is ""contrived"" or ""people just don't act that way."" I'll address each of these cons for folks out there who might be interested but have been turned off by the negativity.

SPOILERS AHEAD

The beginning. A cop named Rick is shot. He's in a hospital. When he wakes up the world has fallen to chaos. It feels too familiar to 28 Days Later. But that's where the similarity ends. Rick comes across a father and son, who save him and tell him it's safe in Atlanta. That they will soon make their way there. So Rick decides if his wife and son are alive that's probably where they'd be. Atlanta, of course, is overrun. He hides in a tank where apparently the operators were also taken by the virus. Rick is saved by Glenn who watched him crawl in the tank. The group who Glenn is with outside the city happens to be the group whom Rick's wife is with; and she isn't alone. She's been getting down with his best friend Shane, who left him to die in the hospital.

Contrived? I'd say, yes, there are some coincidences that seem a bit far out, Rick's reunion with his wife the most egregious. It will depend on your point of view. I think when you start watching, you expect him to find his wife. If you think it shouldn't have happened, you'll think it was contrived, no matter what. Because in that situation it really has to be ""contrived."" This reunion is what drives the rest of Season 1, so if you can't suspend disbelief with regard to it, you will hate this series.

Why do they kill themselves out of nowhere? Why? Why? Why? I don't even know what to say to this. Wouldn't you think about it in their situation? This is very real to human nature, in my opinion, and I didn't think characters ""did it out of nowhere."" They were probably all thinking about it at one time or another, only some were actually willing to do it.

Guns? Why didn't they have more guns? After all, why wouldn't that have been their first priority? With all the guns in the South surely their would be guns EVERYWHERE, falling from the sky, the naysayers pout. I say in a time of panic, humans shift to the most basic parts of the pyramid for survival. Food, Water, Clothing, Shelter. Guns would certainly be on the list, and these folks admitted they needed more guns, but I could understand how, in a time of panic, that might not have been as much a priority. Also, in the beginning, they didn't necessarily know their would be ""herds"" roaming. They were away from their town and far from the city, so they had a false sense of security.

Why do the characters keep doing dumb things? Admittedly, these excursions lead to chaos more often than not, but isn't that why we watch? Don't we watch or read these zombie dramas to see the group attacked? To see how they react to adversity? To watch the breakdown of humanity as we revert to our basic instincts? Rick has a good heart, and he DID grab guns from the station. When he was ambushed he left them in Atlanta. So naturally, his inclination is to retrieve the guns, while doing something good: saving a man he handcuffed to a bar. That is in-line with him as a character: analytical, pragmatic, but not always totally logical. This is in contrast to Shane, who at all the twists and turns believes they should be ruthless. The contrast is clear throughout, never so much as the end of Season 2.

END SPOILERS

The bottom line: if you enjoy the zombie genre, great acting, interesting characters, wacky situations, and heart-thumping tension, (and if you have Netflix or AMC on demand), I'd highly recommend throwing on the pilot. This is the type of series where the hook is obvious and if you aren't into it by then, you won't be. If you are like me, you're in for a very, very fun ride, and you won't be able to stop watching once you've started.

I will warn you, there is a lot of blood and violence.  I couldn't watch the first season without my boyfriend being present because I had zombie nightmares. :)  The show morphs into a deeper and darker look at human nature, and in Season two it becomes less about fighting zombies and more about the power struggle between men.  This show is a must see, and I warn you - it will be difficult to wait seven days in between episodes and brutal when you have to go months before the next one!!",1357171200,,644,4.378151260504202

It was a bit slow paced at times and quite shocking at others. Once again, the writing is superb on this show and really takes the viewer for a ride. You buy into the characters almost immediately and root for certain ones more then others. I believe once the shock of season 1 was over, season 2 lulled viewers into a false sense of boredom and safety. After seeing the first half of season 3, it is clear that this roller coaster ride isn't over yet and season 2 was a moment of peace in a crazy world. Everything makes more sense after season 3.

4810809,5,B005LAJ23A,"It's fantastic that Rick remains dedicated to his group. He could have so easily given up on Maggie and Glenn, but literally slipping into enemy territory and facing certain death wasn't enough to keep him or Daryl and Oscar away. He's done a good job proving his leadership ability and even giving Daryl some focus when the prospect of Merle came up.

That said, Rick is still stuck with some emotional issues. I had thought that it had been a quick fix after his phone revelation, but seeing Shane was not a good sign that things are back in order. It was a nice surprise I wasn't expecting, but I can't wait to see how long until Rick breaks again.

And did anyone think Shane looked like Wolverine with that haircut and beard?

I did enjoy the gun fight, although I though Glenn and Maggie's rescue seemed a little easily done. Yet, it was certainly interesting that the two sides really didn't get a chance to meet and spent more time anonymously apart and firing bullets.

It really makes me want to see a personal standoff between Rick and the Governor even more. Except I have a feeling that the Governor Rick will be forced to face down the road will be nothing short of pure evil.",1356912000,,1190,4.470046082949309

4810933,5,B005LAJ23A,"I loved the Walking Dead as soon as I saw the first episode, but it just keeps getting better and better as it goes along.  I have seen where people criticize the show for being slow-paced or not gory enough, but I think it is a wonderful portrayal of the human drama behind a zombie apocalypse.  When the action does come, its well-paced, and exciting without being over-blown.

Season 2 portrays the Atlanta survivors coming upon Herschel Walker's farm, and struggling to deal with issues both inside thegroup, and with Herschel and his people.  The first 7 episodes build toward the heart-wrenching mid-season finale.  The second half of season 2 picks up with the group undergoing drastic changes that set up the fantastic season 3.  Can't wait for February when it returns to AMC!

Aside from the show itself, this Blu-Ray collection is a good buy for fans of the show, and anyone wanting to get up to speed with the series",1356652800,,928,4.691358024691358

I actually poked fun at the idea until I watched the 1st episode, after which I was HOOKED. My 21 year old son actually convinced me to watch The Walking Dead and now I am a diehard fan.  The characters are complex, the storyline surprising, and the Zombie action not for young eyes and ears.  It is gory..... but once you get past the gore... you cannot wait until the next episode.

4811033,5,B005LAJ23A,"Borrowing from the Zombie Culture of Romero's Night of the Living Dead and based on the comic of same name, this is Zombie horror at its best. Season 2 includes the same cast from Season 1, with some excellent additions such as Herschel and Maggie.  There is a sub-plot tension of a love triangle between Lori, Rick and Shane which boils to a zombie fiesta conclusion.  The best episode of the series is the one where the barn door comes open.  Excellent acting by the leads, Andrew Lincoln especially good.  The music is excellent as well, complementing the tension.  I am reminded at times of the ""Left for Dead"" game series by Valve, especially in Season 1 when Daryl says concerning his brother, that he was ""left for dead"".  The Blu Ray transfer is fine, not as crisp as some of the best transfers I have seen,  but above average. The extras are also fun to watch and are a good addition. If you are a zombie fan, this is a must have!",1356566400,,939,4.393063583815029

4811253,4,B005LAJ23A,Skip the commercials and watch it here. Season two is what defined the direction of Walking dead. Character development is key here. If you thought season two would be a resident evil video game on autopilot then you will be disappointed. Many felt this season was drawn out and slow. I feel that people feel this way because they were looking for the wrong thing. The deterioration of Sean is fascinating to watch. By the end of the season you can understand Characters actions based on their current mentality. Lincoln gives us the Stability of the ranch to see this development without much outside distraction. It sets a great stage for season 3.,1356393600,,650,4.761061946902655

4811607,5,B005LAJ23A,"In my opinion The walking dead is one of the best series in years!
So, of course, I had to get it on DVD. Unfortunately there is no uncut version in Germany or even the UK.

So for any fan in Europe, of course you need a Region 1 DVD player:
I ordered it from the US, it arrived even before the estimated delivery date and even after paying the VAT it was still cheaper than buying it in Germany...

The series itself is just great, just see for yourself... definitely worth the money!",1355961600,,485,4.148936170212766

4811639,5,B005LAJ23A,This is a show that keeps you on edge all the time.  I have yet to come across a dull/slow episode.  I know some people said this season wasn't as good as season 1 but I tend to disagree.  There may not have been as many walker encounters but the internal tensions still made it good TV.  This is a show that has a regular cast yet nobody is safe (reminds me of 24) which adds alot to the tension.  I would recommend this show 100% to anyone who likes or even sort of likes zombie shows.  Do not watch if you are squeemish!!!  My mother who is 78 really likes this show as well. Great writing and cast combined with excellent zombie make-up makes this a great exciting tension filled show to watch.

There's actual chemistry between the characters.
no matter how out of this world a situation may seem, the plot and the cast keep things rolling and involved. There is literally NEVER a dull moment.
I love that many of the plot twists and most gut turning moments depend on peoples short comings and personal vendettas.
Cast, shooting, plot, camera work, zombie make up are all super sweet",1355875200,,405,4.8

4811718,5,B005LAJ23A,"Thankfully the second series of the Walking Dead was longer than the 6 episodes that the first series left us all drooling over. The Walking Dead is well-written, well-acted, and just an all-around enjoyable show. Season 2 brings us back to the group of survivors that Season 1 was following around, and somehow there is just not a moment of boredom, even though the overall story is the same in every episode: ""Survive or become a walker."" There is gore but not B-movie gore, and there is plenty of drama without going into soap-opera territory.",1355702400,,546,4.757894736842105

4811722,5,B005LAJ23A,"Obviously must have for fans of the comics Zombie-ists everywhere, this series is more than just blood and guts. This show digs into the nuances of what would really happen in a Zombie apocalypse. The writing is aces and the actors, for the most part, really make you believe that each breath could be their last. No one is (really) safe, as the subtle twists that diverge from the source material really keep fans on the edge of their seats. Not to mention, this is one of the only shows that many of my family and coworkers all have a vested interest in, so there is much conversing to be had after each senses wringing episode.

4811741,5,B005LAJ23A,After hearing so many people praise this show and seeing random episodes on AMC I decided to take it upon myself to give it a shot.  Zombies always have interested me and this show definitely fills that nitch.  The show starts more about survival in a chaotic world with how people thrive with flesh eating dead walking about but ends up being more about the horrors of how terrible humans can be.  Very well written and the actors are spectacular.  Would easily recommend to anyone and the digital content allow for mobile viewing in HD to catch up to season 3.,1355616000,,562,4.534653465346534

The acting is good, story line fun, although a couple of the characters are whinny which can be irritating but overlooking that .. its just a fun series.

4811924,5,B005LAJ23A,"I've heard some call Season 2 slow and boring, but I thought it was relentless and heart-pounding.  The Second Season of the Walking Dead, the hit TV show, is back and it rocks.  Season 2 builds its characters effortlessly while introducing new little twists to keep you sucked into this world spiraling out of control.  Performances across the board are stellar, and the pacing is impeccable...albeit a little slower than Season 1.

Blu-Ray Review:

Video 8/10 - It looks solid and at moments beautiful, but the film grain is a little to oppressive for it's own good and there was ghosting that made some of the extended conversations a little dizzying.

Audio 10/10 - Full spectrum mix that captures everything from the faint chirping of crickets to the powerful bass heavy gunfire.  Dialogue never gets lost in the mix, and everything is very crisp and clear.

Shocking developments in the 2nd half of the season will have you glued to your seat, begging for just one more episode.  I would know, because I blew through the whole season in less than a day!  I have yet to see a show that advertises zombies and gore, which it has plenty of, but focuses on the trials and moral complexity of a world gone completely insane.  Favorite TV show?

It's like we've got the RV walker in our own home (except the RV walkers head is about 80% the size of a regular human head)!  My kids refuse to be in the same room with it, so that's kind of funny.  It's good to put on display when we have company, a real conversation piece!  The screw driver in the eye pops the head up so you can access the disks inside.

The special edition is modeled after a zombie that is encountered in the beginning of season 2. It is a zombie that was taken out with a screw driver through the eye.

Designed by renowned Todd McFarlane, this is no exception and is fantastically designed and I highly recommend it for fans of the show. The stand that the head boldy states the title of the show ""Walking Dead"". It stands firmly with little - no danger of it tipping over like so many do. the head tilts back to reveal both season one & season 2 of ""The Walking Dead"". It is very well crafted and looks very life like (or should I say Walking Dead like?..lol). Definitely high quality and a must buy for fans of the show.",1354320000,,977,4.392265193370166

I am enjoying the shows character progression. It is rich and authentic. When a character makes a descent into craziness, you believe it!

4812734,4,B005LAJ23A,"I like zombie movies, but I'm also one of the first to admit that the genre can become trite after a time, generally becoming a nihilistic romp of rag-tag survivors trying to evade a never-ending horde of shambling dead where the variations are minimal. Until ""The Walking Dead,"" that is. Dragging the format out to a weekly serial allows for more time to explore the social and psychological effects of surviving a zombie apocalypse. I love the second season particularly because the undead are not the worst thing out there. The disintegration of the group and perpetual ethical quagmires of a changing world and society dominate the theme of the second season, creating much more than a gore-splattered thrill ride. Combine that with an excellent cast and crew who draw you into the drama and tension with a masterful skill and spectacular visual effects and it works to make this one of the best damn shows I have ever seen in any genre and a must-have for zombie lovers.",1353369600,,975,4.775147928994083

4812786,4,B005LAJ23A,I love this show but Season 2 dragged a little bit. The new characters are interesting in their own way but with the whole group staying in one place for so long it really needed some more action.,1353283200,,196,4.184210526315789
4812787,4,B005LAJ23A,"So, now we are left behind by Creator/Showrunner Frank Darabount who did near perfection with The Dead in Season 1. Will Season 2 be nearly as good, or was this a one-note show? I actually thought that quite a bit between those two seasons. And honestly I had to downgrade it one star for what I and most of my Dead fan friends thought started too talky and not nearly enough action. To be honest, about 3 shows in, I wasn't picking this show off my DVR first any longer. It got bogged down in a lot of feelings (and that criticism is fair because sure I expected a certain amount of expressed emotion in a series this real and horrible (in situations, certainly not in storyline, etc.). But whole episodes devoted to emotions and relationships, here is where the Dead teetered on getting soapy and after the stellar Season 1, it was a stark contrast.

However, fear not! Somewhere around Episode 9 (Triggerfinger) and 11 (Judge, Jury, and Executioner) it found its original excitement and energy and got back on track. As I always do when reviewing shows like The Walking Dead,  I encourage you not to allow those under the age of 16 to watch it. There is a great deal of blood and gore (not for the sake of sensationalism, it lends to the reality of the situation of living under the constant threat of the ""zombie virus"" which has, in season 2, begun to sink in as reality for the characters as well). For people particularly sensitive to this type of action, well, I admit The Dead is not for everyone (I actually am not particularly fond of it myself). But the scenes are not done to pull in boys under 17. It is a full -fledged adult drama that I would put up against nearly anything offered at the movie theaters (in my opinion, in league with Homeland and Sons of Anarchy).

I know money is tight now - which I am repeating in my reviews of all seasons of Dead - and I would not push a show I didn't think was worthy of spending it on. And DO yourself a favor and buy the blu-ray version. I'm actually going to add all three seasons to my Wish List on here. It would make great Christmas gifts for people like me who have watched it from the beginning, but also those you know who keep saying they'd love to pick it up but are too busy. It's the best of the best and I highly recommend Season's 1 and 2. For Season 3, go read that review. Enjoy!",1353283200,,2353,4.295045045045045
4812788,5,B005LAJ23A,Amazon makes it easy to watch my favorite shows online.  The Walking Dead Season 2 was great.  The Walking Dead is one of my favorite shows.,1353024000,,140,4.346153846153846
4812789,5,B005LAJ23A,"Personally, I thought Season 2 did drag on a bit with the ""GREAT SOPHIE HUNT !!!""  But as far as the Blu-Ray set is concerned--are you kidding me !?!?!?!?  Can I say F*****G AWESOME !!!!!!!!!!!!!  That's all I have to say !!!",1353024000,,225,4.309523809523809

4812792,5,B005LAJ23A,"First i'd like to point out that this will be review of limited edition statue and not show itself.
So let's get down to business :)
The statue looks pretty cool and it's definitelly worth 60$ that i originally paid,but price went up 10$ since then, and  in my opinion it's 10$ too much.
There has been a lot of complaining about the paint job on the head,but with exception of the right eye (they did bad job here) everything looks great.
Details are amazing and everything seems so real.
For example,when you touch the nose or ears it feels like you touching real persons face,so that seems like a big plus to me.

Downside of this set appears in two places.
First is screwdriver. While pretty good visually, it's made of some really light plastic and honestly it feels like you could brake it with one finger. Second downside is the base of the head (whit Walking dead logo), and here is the same problem like screwdriver-same light and probably cheap plastic.

I should also mention that blue ray packaging that comes with the zombie head is exclusive and you can't buy it without the statue (big plus for amazing cover art ;) ).

So this is it
All in all,it's a good set that i would recommend to any fan out there who likes statues and stuff like that...
If not, than save your money and buy second season without the statue,after all it's ""The walking dead"" show that's important here :)",1352851200,,1394,4.4763779527559056

My advice to anyone considering getting into this show... Get a Netflix subscription for one month, and cancel it. 1 month of Netflix is only $8, and to buy the shows on here, you'd need to pay $57. Plus you'd be able to use Netflix for anything else, and even keeping the subscription for 7 months would be cheaper than buying them here.

Which just makes this show great to watch as you see them evolve troughtout the series. Yes they do make stupid decisions but don't think that is just bad writing because that is how it's meant to be. The first two seasons are meant to show how they deal with the situation and how they are not used to anything like it. By the 3rd season you see how they have already figured things out and stoped being stupid. Which makes you feel proud of the characters and that watching each stupid thing they did was worth it. Now this show is based on comics (that are great!)so the foundation for the whole show is already there, just with some differences. Mostly what happens on the show varies in that some characters are taken off the show and things those character do in the comic are done by other character in the show. This makes it a lot more interesting for people who already read the comic because you don't really know what is going to happen to who, you just know it's going to happen.

Sooooo, last Sunday night I watched a couple of episodes from season two and watched the premiere of season three and I became officially hooked.  Gulp....I am now a walker fan.

I decided that I needed to play catch up, so I purchased season one and season two and now my Husband, who isn't really a zombie killing kind of guy, is hooked.

Give The Walking Dead a try.  There is so much more to it than zombies trying to kill humans and vice versa.  There are great plots, great characters and a writing style like no other. Kudos to the writers for their superb job of keeping us entertained!

4813457,5,B005LAJ23A,"I normally don't write reviews for popular shows such as The Walking Dead however, I know several people that have yet to jump on the Walking Dead bandwagon. I'm not saying that my review will get anymore viewers to start watching, but I am someone who doesn't follow any drama series and was deterred by the fact that this is a drama series set during a zombie apocalypse. I didn't think I would enjoy the show but I was surprised at how much I like the story and therefore someone who might read this review could become a fan as well. My review will not cover analysis or critique of episodes but rather an overall review about my experience with the second season and the quality of the overall product.

The menus are very simplistic and is easy to navigate. Each disc contained in the packaging contains 4 episodes. This Bluray presentation of the Walking Dead presents a fully high-def presentation of the show. To make this review short, you will be so hooked on each cliffhanger the episodes provide that you will realize you've been watching for hours when you switch the discs. This show has an incredible story that provides fast paced development with complex characters you'll love and hate. There isn't a character that is considered the prototypical bad guy and you may even start questioning the protagonist's decisions.

Before watching this series Zombieland was the only Zombie movie/show I consider myself a fan of. This show however, takes the cake for the best zombie story ever.",1350691200,,1502,4.773076923076923

4813632,3,B005LAJ23A,"This is the best place I suppose to rate the entire season, I promise not to give any real spoilers.  Season two most certainly is much slower than season one.  I'll bet over time the second season will become more appreciated.  Granted, watching season two after rip roaring season one was like trying to satify yourself with a ride in a Prius after a joyride in a Corvette, but it was more entertaining than the naysayers claim.  Episode one was as intense as what you find in season one, and the last three episodes are as well (especially the final one).  In my personal opinion the investment of character development in season two will only add more to the series as the story continues.  I don't rate it as high as season one for the simple fact that it is true that there are several episodes that are just plain boring.  It's still worth a watching if you are a fan of the show or just simply like zombie flicks.",1350259200,2,921,4.382352941176471

4813732,2,B005LAJ23A,"It's mainly about a bunch of individuals in the middle of a war who are unable to get over their petty differences and simply get along with each other.  They all end up killing each other with their own stupidity.  Why have people in your zombie fighting group who can't be trusted?  Then there is the backstory about stumbling zombies who apparently are able to move at a consistent 15 MPH.  Just have some zombie rules and follow them.  They're stumbling and they walk really slow, so follow that one freaking rule at least.  Show some consistency.  We find out that apparently everyone is a carrier and Rick held it from the group (seems like this would be really relevant given his wife is pregnant with a possible zombie baby).  The CDC guy informed them of this which is odd because he was following all the CDC protocol to avoid exposure to the disease.  Please don't try explaining it...it is just stupid.  Then some other group wants to take over their farm because apparently, there aren't enough empty farms to be found in the country during a zombie apocalypse, and it is necessary to take stuff from people.  Instead of hitting up Walmart for supplies they go into a town with lots of buildings and hit a tiny pharmacy that isn't very secure.  Their zombies are less intelligent than buffalo, and yet they can't figure out how to kill masses of them.  Finally, one would think they would use some strategy in fighting the zombies and secure the perimeter, but nope, none of that stuff....just hold up in a farm next to some woods.  They don't even give any thought to weapons.  Nobody bothers with a silencer of any kind, and instead of using weapons like oh a baseball bat, a long machette, or a samurai sword, their weapons of choice are screwdrivers and knives that result in lots of blood getting sprayed all over them.  Writers should have watched Zombieland a few times.  Should I even mention trying to drive a ancient Winnebago across the country in a post apocalyptic world?  Oh, and what the heck is with them coveting a crappy book?  Did libraries, book stores, book shelves, etc go away in their post apocalyptic world?",1350000000,4,2145,4.626984126984127

4813814,5,B005LAJ23A,"This isn't a review of the show but a complaint with Amazon. I gave it 5 stars because the show deserves it and I don't want to lower its rating with my Amazon complaint.

I am a huge fan of the show and loved season 2. I just bought it last Friday so I could watch it again before season 3 starts up. I normally don't have problems with Amazon but they let me down this time. I was up to episode 5 on disc 2 when it froze up and skipped to the next episode. I tried a few times to get it to play but it kept freezing. When I looked at the back of the disc, it had a rather large circular scratch. I looked at the other discs and number 3 had this same scratch. This was brand new so it was a factory defect, not Amazon's fault. The problem I have is that Amazon will not replace it. Sure, they will send me a refund which is nice and all, but I wanted a replacement. They told me that since it came from a 3rd party seller, the best I could do was get my money back. Well, when I made the purchase, it clearly said sold and shipped by Amazon. There was no mention of a third party. My problem with all this is that I bought it for a lower price than  what is now listed. So, if I want to get another copy, I have to pay the current price. Sure, this show is worth what it is selling for but it's still not right to make me send mine back, get a refund and then buy at a higher price. Amazon has been good to me in the past but this recent incident leaves me a bit jaded.

If anything can go wrong in any situation you can rest assured it will go wrong. In fact nothing ever works out right. In the realm of human affairs things will go wrong at most maybe 50% of the time. In the realm of the Walking Dead things go wrong about 99% of the time. If someone needs to run to escape the zombies that person will without fail trip or fall and twist or sprain their ankle. Whatever device they need to work in a particular situation will not work. This whole scenario applies to everything they do , to the point of being absurd.  The characters for the most part are about as superficial , selfish ,and stupid as any humans could ever be. Since I get it virtually for free on Netflix I will occasionally watch it for fun. It keeps me laughing the whole time.

4814047,5,B005LAJ23A,It exceeded my expectations the picture quality on Blu Ray is outstanding. The sound all of it make you feel as if your almost there. The Barn Scene in that perfect quality seemed even more intense. Some people say Blu Ray is not all that I disagree I think the quality is much better in both picture and sound. Something TV seems to loose unless your watching it in HD. This show is something I have been waiting for....for a very long time. Something about what people do and how they react to a plague like a Zombie outbreak...or Walker outbreak. It's fascinating to me how this show captures more than what Romero could do on the crappy budgets that Hollywood stuck him with....when the man is the God of Zombie horror. This show as it goes along gives us more depth into how we really are and what we are capable of. In the end we only have to realize this is a plague..zombies are like fleas from rats during the Black Death that wiped out millions in the early 1330's. Some people I have encountered contend Zombies are from Hell. I always reply God nor the Devil had no hand in this...Zombies are disease carriers and carry their disease from one person to the next this is only evolution... primal instinct to feed and spread. After all our own history talks of events in which the living ate the dead to survive this is just the reverse. This show has only begun it's greatness for charters and plots I have a feeling what we have seen so far in Season 1 and 2 is only the tip of the iceberg. If your a fan I highly recommend you buy this and add it to your collection. This show can only get better!!!,1349481600,,1612,4.305921052631579

4814124,5,B005LAJ23A,"I came into Season 2 of The Walking Dead with a good deal of skepticism. Season 1 had a very strong pilot and second episode, but was subsequently marred by stunted acting and uneven writing. I assumed that if they couldn't milk consistently compelling television out of a condensed, 6 episode season, there was little hope for another season with twice as many episodes. I was mistaken.

Tension is the mood Season 2 kicks off with as zombies threaten to overwhelm the survivors on a lonely stretch of highway. What's genius here, and I'm not spoiling too much, is that this is one of the few times during Season 2 in which the ""Walkers"" are the central antagonists. Much of Season 2 is actually the tension of survivors learning to live in a world in which everything they know has been called into question or just plain cast aside.

Everything about this season is better. The locations, the production values, and the zombies are all terrific. The writing is leaps and bounds better in Season 2. The acting is largely better, though some actors are just more gifted than others. In particular the actors who play Herschel, Shane, Maggie and Darryl really shine this season.

At the end of the day, zombies are a terrifying, but largely manageable threat. It's learning to live in a world in which societies' structures and cultural norms have been overwhelmed that presents the biggest challenge. The writers and actors do an excellent job of exploring and conveying the challenges of living with other human beings in such a world. It's that tension of character that makes this season of The Walking Dead so compelling.",1349395200,,1626,4.8

I think they were going for the swollen look but it wasn't really an improvement. Acting was solid and the pairings of men and women are making lots of sense. The bar scene is one of the most intense so far and it wasn't even about zombies. I hope they get a couple more seasons made before they decide to cut budget or simply mess it up with bad ideas.

4814133,5,B005LAJ23A,"This season: who will survive?

Season two continues the gangs story of survival in a death filled zombie apocalypse world with more drama, false hope, and moral themes. Many viewers often talked about the stretching out of certain subplots, but I feel its all about timing. Consider that the TV series airs with mid-season breaks and small cliffhangers certain events need to play out. Plus I feel its for added drama effect. Only then will you understand that the timing makes sense and justifiable (I won't want to reveal spoilers even with season two long over). Timing in a tv series is all about impact to the viewer and this series excels at it. The ending to this season leaves you begging for a quick return to season three.

In season one I noticed a lot of ""film grain"" or noise if you will. I accepted it and thought it added to the setting and tone of the series. This seasons transfer onto blu-ray is still great and perhaps better than season one. While some other HD shows either use ""better"" cameras (such as Game of Thrones) the picture still remains plenty sharp. I'd rate the surround sound about the same as I would picture quality.

Extra's finally add the webisodes with its story telling shifting to a background character from the first season. Its worth a watch. I do wish since this was the blu-ray that the webisode could not show the AMC logo. The minidocuments are all entertaining but like most extra's these days can be viewed a bit too quickly. I truly wish they would've included the addition of ""The Talking Dead"" on the extra's. Maybe season three and maybe on a collectors edition? Its a great aftershow that compliments the episodes while they air, and something I think hardcore viewers would like archived on blu-ray to view again.

The Walking Dead seasons on blu-ray are a day one must buy in my book. No blu-ray collection should be without this incredible tv series.",1349222400,,1910,4.658753709198813

4814187,5,B005LAJ23A,"SPOILER

I enjoyed both first and second seasons of The Walking Dead. I'll say that I've never read the comics, so I have no basis for comparison between both.

Anyway, from what I understand, this is a show that should take four or five seasons most before ending. No matter how complicated and hard are the situation of the characters and their relationship, I think there is not enough plot and premise to extend the show for six, seven, eight seasons.

I thought Season 2 is as good as Season 1 (and longer, of course, with 13 episodes). The fact that whole lot of episodes occur in a time frame of two, three days was very unusual. But the scary moments were enough to excite me, a good balance between the drama that evolve in the farm (however, I did not expect the ""Pregnancy Card"" to come so soon into play...)and the damned zombies.

The extras in this package are also excellent, with figurine details, the death of Shane, some interviews with cast.

Acting is top notching. Heck, I watched the whole thing in two days!

I do not think they will be running a season 3 on this franchise. I had a feeling they were punching the clock with writing and production values. The lower writing standard was evident in the cursory exploration of societal and community issues. The whole abortion timeline could have been a lot more controversial. The issues of security within a community and the para militarization of the police or loss of freedom as a result were topical at best. The writing just didn't help provoke thoughtful introspection.",1349136000,,689,4.655737704918033

It makes sense that as a show like this goes on, they must delve into the growth of the characters, their motivations, relationships, etc.  It can't just be all action, all the time, zombies chasing people around ad nauseum.  After not much time, that would get pretty old.  This season is interspersed with periods of downtime for the main characters to recoup just enough to be taken by surprise when the next horrible thing happens to them.

I found myself agonizing over the decisions they had to make, feeling as conflicted as the characters were portrayed to feel in the confusion of adapting to this new world where survival is the main objective.  Do the old rules still apply?  Can they apply?  There were lots of very tense and scary scenes.  Lots of characters lost their lives, including several leading characters, and some new ones were added.

I Love this product, the quality of the videos is amazing and the fact that Amazon checks for the internet connection to enhance your viewing experience is great. Not all other companies like Netfilx and others do that. The video selection is useful and simple. No need for complicated options, just click on the episode and it starts. Love the auto-play function and the episodes get better as the season goes by. Would love to see a scene selection option or a subtitles or audio option. Besides that the product is great, no need to look anywhere else for this product. Amazon gives you top quality for your money. I highly recommend this product.",1348704000,,768,4.613138686131387

Out of all the post apocalyptic shows that seem to be popping up lately, The Walking Dead, is by far the most bone chilling.  The gruesome nature of this show though is not for the faint of heart.  I find myself turning away from the TV from time to time because of how nasty some of the scenes are.  This show keeps you immersed for nearly the whole time you watch.  Can't wait to see if the character's luck will turn around at all in the the 3rd season!",1348704000,,592,4.149122807017544

Boy, am I glad I did. I received the order quickly, it was packaged nicely and securely in a box, and the DVD itself is awesome. Personally, I don't get why people are saying season 2 was too short - there has to be character development somewhere and I feel that season 2 did just that. If you're a fan of horror, suspense, drama, and can handle graphic detail, I suggest you check this show out! You won't be disappointed! :)",1348617600,,626,4.225
4814628,5,B005LAJ23A,"Shane is preparing to get into the shower at the farm and before he gets in he cuts off his hair. He stares into the mirror in a trance.

Flashback to the school:  Shane and Otis are trying to find a way out of the building as the zombies are in the school now.  The zombies are in a frenzy. Otis and Shane are trapped in the gym on top of the closed bleachers. They decide to split up as Otis will never fit through the small window over their head so Otis jumps down and hurts his leg.  He finally makes it to a door and out of the gym.  Shane breaks out a window and starts climbing through it.  A zombie grabs Shane and he shoots him in the face and falls out of the window and down about 15 feet and hurts his leg also.

Carl continues to worsen as he is still bleeding internally and they are waiting for the medical equipment as Shane and Otis are way late and they realize something must have happened.  The group is separated into four parts with part of them at the farm house, part in the woods still looking for Sophia, Shane and Otis are at the school and part at the mobile home guarding it.....

This episode seems slower than some of the others but it really isn't the problem is that with the group divided into 4 separate locations the episode flashes back and forth between each group multiple times.  In addition there are several flashbacks in this episode.  As a result you are changing scenes, characters and time period every 2 or 3 minutes and it makes the presentation seem choppy.

This is an important episode as it sets much of the ground work for the season and expands the characters by adding more people and delving deeper into their personalities.  The true spirit of Shane comes out and the inner conflict of the group is evident throughout this episode.  I still gave this episode a 5 star rating as it is so critical to the storyline.

It is still one of the best series on TV and I recommend this to you as a good episode.",1348617600,,1960,4.231182795698925
4814629,5,B005LAJ23A,"Rick is running with Shane and Otis and trying to get Carl to a farm house before he dies.  He was shot by Otis accidently while Otis was shooting a deer in the woods.  Rick, running like a madman, leaves Otis and Shane far behind and arrives at the farmhouse and asks for Hershel because Otis said he could possibly help Carl.  Carl is seriously injured. Shane and Otis finally arrive at the farm.

The bullet was slowed by going through the deer and broke into 6 fragments. Carl has internal bleeding and a vessel is torn. They need to open him up and get 5 of the fragments as they are too deep to reach without killing Carl and the blood vessel needs to be closed. They need a respirator and surgical tools before they can operate. They have to go into town to a school to find the items to save Carl at a FEMA trailer that was set up.  Otis and Shane are going to go to the school.

The group is separated into three parts with part of them at the farm house, part in the woods still looking for Sophia and part at the mobile home guarding it.

Rick is the only source of blood for Carl and he gives so much and so often that he is weak and ready to pass out during most of this episode.  Meanwhile Shane and Otis go to the school to find it surrounded by over a hundred zombies wandering right where they need to go....

This is a suspenseful episode and it is the set up for the balance of the season.  The farm may be a safe haven for the group but Rick isn't thinking about that as he is so worried about Carl.  Meanwhile the balance of the group is still either in the woods returning to the vehicles or at the mobile home.  Lori finally arrives at the farm house and is totally emotionally upset about Carl's serious wound.

This is a suspenseful second episode to the season and it will keep you on the edge of your seat worrying about Carl and watching the scenarios that the other characters are in.  This is an important episode as it sets much of the ground work for the season and expands the characters by adding more people and delving deeper into their personalities.  I rate it as 5 stars and recommend it to you.",1348617600,,2134,4.183374083129585

I saw Season 2 on air and then just watched it again on DVD. I don't really find it to be particularly slow. I really liked the interaction amongst the group. It's good to see people acting like actual people, and not like they turn into super-Rambo at the drop of a hat. The DVD Extras were interesting, but i don't think there were enough. Could have replaced the piece on the schmuck who scored the background sounds with something more insightful on the past of the actors and their interaction on set. Still, an amazing follow up to Season 1.",1348617600,,695,4.395348837209302

4814717,5,B005LAJ23A,"The season starts off with a bang but then kind of drags after the first episode until about mid season. However, this is excused for good reason.  Lots of character development this season!  You have to care about these characters to care if they live or die right?  This will cause you to absolutely love some of them or hate them and want to see them go.  If the first season was full of action it was because it was only 6 episodes.  This being a full 13 episode season, nothing seems rushed and is extremely satisfying.  I am one of the graphic novel fans out there that LOVE the show and don't try to compare the two.  They are their own entities and the show beautifully compliments the books.  The last two episodes are AMAZING and entertainment does not get any better.

Plenty of military weapons laying around, M2 .50 caliber machine guns, tanks ( why not start one up and use it? )etc... and they do not gather them. They keep themselves meagerly armed despite many opportunities to upscale their protection. Someone needs to pick up one of those M2 machine guns a mow down a heard of walkers. Then it would be more interesting. Budget issues? Poorly done.",1348444800,3,539,4.934065934065934
4814720,5,B005LAJ23A,"Atlanta is deserted except for the dead and the dogs. Sheriff Rick Grimes broadcast a message on the portable radio. Atlanta is dead and they are moving on to Fort Benning, Ga. They load up into the mobile home, jeep and motorcycle and move on to find help. He is trying to leave a message for Morgan like he promised he would do.

The interstate is blocked with a wreck and stopped cars and they weave their way into a maze. The mobile home breaks a radiator hose and they have to stop and repair it. The sheriff's wife is nervous as the cars remind her of a grave yard and they are on guard for zombies. They search for fuel, water and food. A zombie is coming and suddenly a whole troop of them appears.  There are hundreds or more and they begin moving through the cars looking for food.  The sheriff and his fellow surviving humans  have to hide under cars and under dead bodies to not be found.

The zombies pass but a straggler sees the little girl, Sophia. She gets up and runs into the woods and the sheriff goes after her and so do the zombies.  The sheriff finds the little girl and tells her to hide in a washout in the river. He will come back for her after he kills the zombies....

This series is just one of the most intense and graphic shows on TV.  If you like zombie films and stories you will love this show and this season is really good.  This zombie show is so innovative in its concepts. Zombies going into a church because the bell rings and they are clinging to their human behaviors and memories. The special effects and makeup are great and the story line is intense and scary. The personalities and the interaction between the characters is well written and acted out.

4815003,5,B005LAJ23A,"I totally blame my son for getting me into this series!  And so love watching it with him!  We had a marathon once Season 2 arrived at the house and watched both seasons back to back... and then dived into the extras.

Regardless of what you think of Shane, Carl, Lori, Rick, Glen, Dale, Daryl, Andrea, Hershel, Maggie, or any of the other characters in this series, their struggle to survive is fascinating but what really catches my attention is the 'bratty' attitudes, backstabbing, and arguments amongst the survivors.  There are characters you'll love - and those you love to hate ... and it's led to many interesting discussions between my son and I (he's hating Andrea at the moment, and I personally want to drop kick Lori! - and we both love Dale and Daryl!)

Most of Season 2 was fun to watch but nothing dramatic until the last couple of episodes - and believe me they ended the season with a show we watched several times just because it was so spectacular - and my son was fascinated by the chick at the end with the zombies on leashes.

The makeup artists did an amazing job with all the costumes and makeup so the gore is perfect without being overwhelming and quite honestly it's sinfully fun to sit down and enjoy watching the episodes knowing that it's something I do not normally watch... in fact it's one of the few shows I do enjoy watching and look forward to each new episode.

Onto the extras... Since we never watched the webisodes (slow internet and limited bandwith), we were captivated by them but the whole time I wondered how it played into the series - besides the zombies, fear and struggle to survive but then at the end we realized just how it fit - and then Cody decided we must watch both seasons all over again because he's sure there are other things he missed the first couple times - and I'll be right there watching it with him.

On a more personal note however, my son hates to read but after watching the first season he was curious about the books so I bought him the entire series.  He's read them all and keeps pointing out the differences between the books and the series so he really appreciated the extra that explains why they changed the order some of the events happened.

I'm so ready for Season 3 to start!  Unfortunately will have to be downloading the episodes since our television network no longer carries AMC... but refuse to miss them!",1348185600,,2395,4.4953917050691246

The Blu ray picture quality is nice if not a bit grainy and I would of liked a bit more extras. I am very happy with the season 2 set. Now on to the head! I am very pleased wit the head and it's almost life size proportions. I would say it's about the size of a nine year olds kids head. This will look amazing on your shelf. The head is kind of made out of a plastic,rubber Halloween like mask material glued to a hard plastic frame. If I had to nit pick I would of wished the eye was a bit more detailed,the paint job on the pupil and iris looks like two paint blobs on top of each other. I would of liked it to have a more realistic eye and a clear plastic gloss finish. I wish the teeth were a bit more detailed as well, perhaps a hard plastic and the same kind of gloss. The teeth are kind of rubbery like a mask. The screw driver could of been a bit more solid, as it feels hollow. That's nit picking and compared to a Blu ray set of this proportion this cant be beat for the price. I am very happy with this purchase. Just don't expect movie prop quality with this awesome price.",1348099200,,1170,3.940928270042194

The 4-Disc Blu-Ray is currently at $41.96 on Amazon but for $18 more you can get the Limited Edition version which contains the Blu-Ray discs and a cool looking zombie head to put it in. The head itself is very detailed and made of a soft plastic. The base is made of a harder plastic. The screwdriver can be removed and stabbed back in the eye. The zombie head looks GREAT on my shelf next to my hardcover TPBS of The Walking Dead comics. My only complaint (and it's a small preferential complaint) is that there isn't enough room for me to fit Season 1 & 2 into it.",1348012800,2,788,4.331081081081081

This is a collectible grade set, if you are inclined to keep it in mint condition.

4815130,5,B005LAJ23A,"Season 2 of The Walking Dead is even more intense than Season 1.  The characters become more fully realized as their situation becomes more desperate.  The acting and the script are top notch, and the fact that the viewer has no idea when a Walker will show up turns the tension up to the point of being agonizing.  The final scene of the episide Pretty Much Dead Already is the best one of both seasons, and the deaths of two of the main characters comes out of nowhere.  The final episode finds the group in worse shape than they've ever been as they unknowingly face another turning point in their lives.

There's a great special feature with Robert Kirkman, the creator of the original graphic series on which the show is based.

Featuring former police officer ""Rick"" as the leader of a small group in a world that is infested with zombies after he first wakes up from a coma in season 1. Rick has come a long way now and has survived the impossible by using strategic plans and some crazy ideas. Rick is not alone in this horrific world. He is with his wife and son and he must protect them from the dangers that have elimnated most of the human race. I personally started watching the Walking Dead the day that it aired on AMC and it was so amazing I just had to keep watching. If there is one show that will get you hooked, it's definitely this one. Zombie lovers are going to absolutely enjoy every single episode from season 1 to season 2. With season 3 fastly approaching this October 2012 I would recommend you to catch up until the last episode of season 2 if you haven't done so already. Overall this a great TV series that is sure to last long since it has so many fans! The grand finale of season 2 was just shocking! It was filled with action and tons of zombies from the firist couple of minutes. This isn't like your everyday zombie movie...

4815296,4,B005LAJ23A,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Miss.

The Walking Dead is one of the best adaptations from a comic book I've run across.
I don't believe in zombies, but if I did, this is how I'd imagine it. I like the fact that the entire series was shot with 16mm and shot in the south, Grantville, GA. The police chief says to beware if you visit between now and Sept. 20.
""Please plan your routes accordingly.  In addition, you may hear gun fire associated with the filming so don't be alarmed,"" Interim Chief Jordan said.
In season two, our reluctant leader Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) is taking the group of survivors to Fort Benning. They come across a traffic jam. While trying to clear the road to get the vehicles moving, a large group of walkers (what they call the zombies) approaches.
One of the small girls in the group, Sophia, is chased out from under the relative safety of the vehicle and becomes lost in the woods. Rick and Daryl Dixon, one of the tougher survivors, organize a search party.
Rick has a constant fight with other survivors about his decisions, plus his wife, Lori, is pregnant, but he doesn't know it. Thinking he was dead, she had an affair with his best friend and fellow officer, Shane Walsh.
While Rick, his son Carl and Shane are looking for Sophia, they come across a deer. The boy goes to pet the animal, when a shot from the opposite direction kills the deer, the bullet goes through and is lodged in Carl. They end up on a large isolated farm run by veterinarian, Hershel Greene.
Greene patches up the boy, but clearly doesn't want this new group staying. More conflict arrises when it's discovered he's locked several walkers in the barn, not wanting to kill them because some were family. This series never lets up.",1347408000,,1767,4.570977917981073

4815375,5,B005LAJ23A,"Let's be honest, I never really was into zombie movies and the like. Except for the occasional 'high profile' films that would come out(like Romero's 'Living Dead' series, 28 Days/Weeks  Later, Zombieland), I'd stay away from them. I always figured that if you seen one, you seen 'em all. Then, when I saw this show, all that changed. I caught the fever and can't seem to get enough of them. I'm sure you can tell by my reviews, I have to get my daily 'zombie' fix or else. I'm addicted, what can I say?

The second season opens with Rick and his group of survivors leaving Atlanta.  They come to the decision that Fort Benning will be their next destination. Along the way, they come across a traffic jam of abandoned vehicles on I-85. The group loots several vehicles. When a large horde of walkers approach, they're forced to hide under the vehicles. Sophia is chased away from the camp by two of the remaining walkers and she runs off into the woods. Carl is accidentally shot during the initial search for her. Otis, the man who accidently shot Carl, leads Rick and Shane to a large, isolated farm owned by a veterinarian named Hershel Greene. And that, folks, is basically where it all begins.

You're going to be surprised because alot of things happen this season that you might not have expected to happen..especially with the season finale, which was viewed by a record-breaking 9.0 million viewers, making it the highest rated episode of the series, and the most viewed episode of an original series on AMC, in history.

The thing I love most about the show is how Rick and the group deal with having to fight to live in this terrifying new world. Not only that but how they are changed by the overwhelming realization that those who survive can be far more dangerous than the mindless zombies that roam the earth. Most of the things they do mirror what we would do in a given situation such as that.

If I had any gripes, it would be that there are several characters who stories I would like to see(Daryl, T-Dog and Sophia's Mom, for example). For the moment, at least, their stories hadn't been told and I know that they'd have good stories to tell.

At any rate, the second season is great and even better than the first. I can't wait til the complete third season is released on DVD. Lol, course- that will be awhile as it hasn't even begun yet. If you're just now hearing about AMC's The Walking Dead, I suggest you get seasons one and two and catch up on the storyline. I guarantee that you won't be disappointed. If my wife will get into a show like this when she normally dislikes watching stuff like this, you know there must be something there that drives her to watch(and it's clear it's not to see the zombies chow down, lol). It's a great show. Intense, exciting, & compelling. The Walking Dead rules!

4815377,5,B005LAJ23A,"As someone who takes spending a lot of money seriously and had no intentions of getting this, seeing this for $60 on release day at Best Buy caused me to pick it up and say, ""My god I need this"". The box was amazing, yes, but the actual walker head and the screwdriver mechanism is probably THE coolest thing I have ever seen in a special edition. I liked the special edition of the first season with the doors and zombie mask, but this is something that is a beautiful piece of art. No, it doesn't look like the picture on the box, which is probably THOUSANDS of dollars is special FX makeup, but it's pretty close. I will attach a picture straight out of the box.

For those who say to wait for the ""special edition"", in case they're unable to read, this IS the special edition! Each head is exclusive and the blu-ray inside is exclusive as well -- totally different things included, totally different artwork and case style.

I saw a review on here saying that the head was ""disappointing"" because the paint was ""badly blended"" etc etc. If my picture doesn't prove how beautiful and realistic this thing looks, then I don't know what to tell you. For $60 on blu-ray for an exclusive, limited edition special edition, I'm extremely happy with it!",1347148800,3,1248,4.493392070484582
4815378,4,B005LAJ23A,"Walking Dead has been hugely popular in the comic scene for awhile now, yet the introduction of this AMC show skyrocketed the whole franchise into fame and notability among not just the 'nerdy' markets yet the TV market itself. This surge of popularity has given the franchise an amazing amount of room to branch out to video games, novels, collectibles, etc. So the second season of the TV show was bound to have a lavish collectors edition, and while it isn't a letdown, there are some annoying drawbacks.

For start, the ""head-case"" is pretty cool. It does come from a pretty iconic scene exclusive to the second season of the Walking Dead. The blu-ray discs fit perfectly inside, and the opening/closing mechanism seems pretty solid, yet I keep them with the other blu-ray discs because I see no reason to hide them inside the head. The detail of head seems similar to a high quality Halloween mask up-close, yet looks fantastic from a distance away, and I also love the big title-words underneath the head. Overall, it looks really awesome on a shelf, I have mine on my shelf dedicated to Walking Dead where it holds all my books, issues, and blu-rays of the franchise.

The season itself is pretty awesome, I've found that most readers of the book wish it stuck closer to the book and went through these events much faster. (For comparison, the first two season of this show only cover the first twelve issues of the book, and each issue is very short.) Yet I find the second season to be a more dramatic, realistic, and character driven version of the book. There's more time for each character, and more pacing for each event. There's still certainly some issues with the show, most notably two of the characters are jaw-droppingly more stupid in the show, and some other characters are seemingly not in the show.

The video and audio quality is terrific. Due to the nature of the show, there's a very gritty look with plenty of film grain, yet it all looks great. There's a general lack of a soundtrack, so there's plenty of time to notice all the immersive background sounds, most notably a very subtle effect of a horde of zombies moaning into a collective disturbing feeling that is used numerous times. While the more intense sounds of gunshots and yelling all stay crisp and clear.

This release is spread along four blu-rays, so it's obvious there's a very decent amount of extras here. Yet, the first season had at least one audio commentary on each episode, while this one only has audio commentary on five of the thirteen episodes (and the 20 minute collection of the webisodes). The rest of the special features are pretty awesome, a huge amount of behind the scene and interview featurettes which each clock in around seven minutes. The best part is probably the 30 minutes of deleted scenes.

Now while this release is pretty awesome, there is a looming threat of there being another release of the second season in order to get another $40-$50 out of the diehard fans. This was done with the first season, and it could very well be done with this one with the rest of the audio commentaries. Yet even if that does happen, one could still be happy with this release just for the zombie head-case.",1347148800,,3217,4.666666666666667

4815380,5,B005LAJ23A,"The first season of the Walking Dead was entirely too short, but it left with us a certain feeling that everything was about to change, and not all for the better.

Well, technically the second season is superior. Emotionally, this is the sort of horror-drama survival roller coaster where it comes crashing down to an end. And fans of the books are excited to make the next step of season three.

Now, as far as the BD is concerned, we've got a pretty nice treat. The featurettes are nicely edited, so that's not a lot of rehashing ""oh, so-and-so did such an amazing job at whatever"". The webisodes, which I had never watched before, felt a little weak but the reveal makes it all worthwhile. No spoilers - the fans will love it.

We are also given commentary with almost everything, from the selected episodes to the webisodes, and the deleted and alternate scenes. And the Holy Grail - haunting 7.1, edited where you think you hear something and you instantly want to know what made said noise. It's creepy how well it works.

Something tells me we will see a ""Director's Cut"" release sometime upcoming, just as they did with the first season. And like with the first season, I'll buy that version, too.

4815472,4,B005LAJ23A,"Rick Grimes and his fellow survivors have escaped from Atlanta. Making for Fort Benning and the hope of rescue, the group is waylaid on the highway by a horde of walkers. With one of the group missing and another severely injured, they find a safe haven at a nearby farm and the hope of a new home. But as the days and weeks pass, the unresolved tensions in the group threaten to tear it apart.

The second season of The Walking Dead picks up shortly after the events of the first. Whilst the first only had six episodes to tell its story, the second has thirteen, giving it more time to explore the premise and characters.

Things get off to a strong start in the first few episodes, which focus on the confrontation on the highway and the attempts to bring the group back together. New characters - the Greene family - and a new location - a large farmstead - are introduced and events unfold with some vigour. However, after the third episode the story bogs down a little as characters start spinning their wheels at the farm. This is where the ramifications of a major pre-season production crisis - a budget cut that infuriated showrunner Frank Darabont and saw him leave the series - are at their most noticeable. Whilst the budget problems ground the series for a little too long at the farm, the producers do make the most of the money they do have. The zombie effects are a cut above the more variable effects of the first season and there are some truly gruesome moments that equal the most visceral scenes of any zombie movie that comes to mind.

The long pause at the farm does allow some effective character development, particularly of Shane (Jon Bernthal), whose growing disillusionment with the group and his inability to accept the new status quo and move on is depicted quite well, even if the story does take a few too many episodes to come to a head. However, probably the best characterisation is left to Daryl (Norman Reedus), who evolves from the quieter brother of racist redneck Merle in the first season into a conflicted, complex character who refuses to fit easily into any stereotype. Rick (Andrew Lincoln), our main protagonist, gets a little lost in the mix this season with storylines focusing mostly on other characters, but comes back strong towards the end of the season as he starts to show signs of not handling the stress of command very well. However, his dynamic with Herschel (Scott Wilson) and the twists and turns it goes through is fascinating, with Herschel moving from a pacifistic man of faith to shotgun-wielding zombie-slayer under Rick's (not entirely laudable) influence. The introduction of Maggie (Lauren Cohan) as a love interest for Glenn (Steven Yeun) also adds a rare glimmer of sunlight to a dark season.

Whilst the season does suffer from some slow pacing in its central section, it remains highly watchable, and the pacing issue is mitigated considerably on DVD without a week-long break between each episode. There are some effective moments of dark humour (the 'zombie well' scene is hilarious), the writing is pretty good and the actors mostly effective. Aside from the pacing issue, the character of Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) suffers the worst from inconsistent writing and motivations, which the actress does her best to make sense of but can't quite sell.

Events culminate in a fairly epic two-part season finale in which the bubbling tensions within the group boil over and the biggest battle between the survivors and the zombies to date takes place. Despite some longeurs and niggling problems, Season 2 (****) ends on a high that leaves a lot of balls in the air for the third season and its promise of introducing some of the best characters and storylines from the comic book to the TV series. The series is available now in the UK (DVD, Blu-Ray) and USA (DVD, Blu-Ray).",1347148800,31,3845,4.75

""The Walking Dead: The Complete Second Season""
(AMC, 2012)
------------------------------------------------------------
In its second season, the live-action adaptation of Robert Kirkman's ""Walking Dead"" moves from its emergence as a thrilling new show into a top-notch TV drama. Fans of the comicbook series that the show is based on simply have to let go of the original narrative - the television producers made a clear decision to depart from the strict confines of the print version. Many characters are the same, and the overall zombie-plague scenario remains, but there are many significant changes. And changes for the better, I'd have to say. The comics are great, but so is this show, and I think the move to have the TV show be its own thing is fine -- the scripts are great, the drama is riveting, and the cast are taking ownership of the characters, giving them their own voices. The show is still character-driven, more about the moral crucible of disaster and how each person deals with the tensions between communal effort and individual survival, but the horror, when we see it, is also pretty freaky and intense.

All in all, AMC's ""Walking Dead"" is an unqualified success, with the second season much stronger than the first, and the third season a must-see as well. I can't wait. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1346976000,2,1399,5.245535714285714
4815479,5,B005LAJ23A,"I think I like this season better than season 1, the show moves a lot faster in this season. I'm excited for season three, and I'm sure they won't disappoint! Ive watched trailors for three it looks intense!",1346976000,,207,4.473684210526316
4815560,4,B005LAJ23A,"This show is more than your average zombie shoot'em up.  It focuses on the characters and their struggle to survive in a post apocalyptic world.  However, if you really are not into zombies then this show will not be for you as it does have a lot of gory zombie killing in it.  Overall, I think that this is a good show and lots of fun for the whole family(as long as you don't have young children or don't mind that they have nightmares).",1346889600,,439,4.2023809523809526

4815562,4,B005LAJ23A,"I think I liked this season even more than the first. The zombies are more of a fact of life more easily taken care of, and now the real moral issues begin. Is is okay to abandon a little girl lost (and probably eaten) in the forest at the risk of losing everyone else? Should you have a baby during the zombie apocalypse? What would you do to protect the little bit of normality left to you? Kill dead people? Sacrifice others? Kill living people after your secret hideout? Lie to everyone around you? Or do you just have the right to ""opt out""?

And in this season when regulars die, you feel it a bit more since you've gotten to know them more. You think, 'oh we've survived so much', then WHAM zombie attack! Dead! I've never read the graphic novels, but during the ending moments when the scene pans out and you see where they have stopped for the night I gasped a little. Oh no. Season three is going to be bad. Very very bad....for the characters. For us, it will probably be a really good time. :)

So, if you liked season one just for the zombie gore, you may not like season two as much. But, if you like to dig a little deeper, then this is the season for you.",1346889600,,1171,4.176991150442478

I couldn't wait to watch season 2, then I saw disc 1 of season 2 and quickly became disappointed. That disc dragged on into nothing. Nothing really began until Disc 2, and by then I had lost interest, but watched the next discs anyway.
Overall, season two is full of action, yet it is also full of stupidity: the blind leading the blind, which turned me off immediately. I can't stand to watch stupidity. For me, this is the last season I will watch. I'll wait until the show ends and then read about what happens. Of course, that is just my opinion, but watching a tv show where stupid people continually do stupid things led by an even dumber person is not my choice for entertainment. It is a miracle called Hollywood and scripts that even keep these characters and this thing going. Realistically though, just how long can they keep this show going?

4815784,5,B005LAJ23A,"Creative shows sometimes lose steam in Season Two, but with THE WALKING DEAD Season 2, it only gets better. The writers are on top of their game in Season 2 as our groups of survivors tries to out run the ""walking dead"" and find safety. The writers delve deeply into the moral issues facing the survivors. Nothing is simple and nothing is easy, yet there is an order in all the chaos if they can all stay together.
Our groups leaves Atlanta looking for the safe haven they image has been created by the military. The ""walkers"" are everywhere and in one frightening attack, young Sophia runs off into the woods.
Here is where the story begins to take a turn. Should the others risk their lives searching from someone who may already be dead? After a series of mishaps, the groups end up on the farm of Herschel and his daughters. Somehow his small band has been able to stay in place and survive. Now the power struggle begins between Hershel and Rick and Shane. There are some great thought provoking plot twists in season 2. Watch the season and see how the writers have incorporated so much drama into the series. For the survivors, the world as they knew it is gone. There is no longer a government to provide order and protections. It's every man for himself and can they survive.
It was all the moral dilemmas that astounded me in this season. Are the ""walking dead"" still people who could be cured at some point? What if your loved one was a ""walking dead""? Is is right to risk more lives to possibly save one life? It was a random act of fate, that handfuls of people did not become part of the walking dead. It wasn't based on good or evil just chance. What happens when groups of survivors come into contact with each other?
I just could not stop watching this series. Each episode is more intense and brings up more moral problems. New characters are added and established characters are lost to the zombies. How will it all end?
There have been countless zombie movies and shows through the years. What exactly is a zombie and are they dead or living in another reality? This show could be another one of the silly zombie shows yet it is not. There is compassion in the hearts of people desperately hoping to survive and find the world they have lost. Inter-personal conflicts are real. How would any of us act under these circumstances.
Shane becomes a major player in Season 2 as he goes deeper and deeper into some brewing madness. We see an evil side of Shane this season that is unnerving.
Our group finally is not on the run for the time being. Hershel's farm is a refuge but there is an awful secret he is hiding. The show is simply amazing. If there is one weak spot in the plot, it's the constant movement of people into dangerous situations. If Carl disappears, Rick and Shane go looking for him. When they are gone too long, Lori goes looking for Rick. Rick and Shane return with Carl but now Lori is missing. This scenario plays out over and over to where it goes a bit overboard. At some point, almost everyone is out in the woods looking for someone. Are these risks worth it?
Incredible writing and great actors make THE WALKING DEAD a true gem. The writing in phenomenal as are the actors.",1346630400,4,3216,4.44331641285956

4815786,4,B005LAJ23A,"Blu-ray review:

Spoilers:

During the second season of ""The Walking Dead"" our survivors became the walking wounded as they tried to regroup after losing members. After an attack by zombies on a deserted highway Sophia goes missing. Rick (Andrew Lincoln) feels guilty about this and the group spends time looking for her through half of the season discovering a refuge at the farm owned by Herscel a former vet who helps save Rick's son Carl.

End of Spoilers:

The second season also found the new showrunner Glen Mazzara and his writers struggled with the loss of Frank Darabont but quickly found their footing even as they dealt with budget cuts. The second season sagged a bit during the middle of the season but, on the whole, there was superior character development.

Luckily even when the material is a bit sketchy, the actors do their best with the material and always make the show watchable particularly Jon Bernthal as Shane who continues to play the most morally complex character on the show(comparable only to Bryan Cranston's performance as Walt on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Breaking-Bad-The-Complete-First-Season/dp/B001DJLCRC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Breaking Bad: The Complete First Season</a>). At its best ""The Walking Dead"" compares to ""Breaking Bad"" and the best shows on TV.

""The Walking Dead"" is shot Super 16mm film. The grainy, coarse presentation on Blu-ray (and the DVD)is intentional--you'll notice it's far grittier looking than AMC's presentation but you'll also notice greater depth, clarity and detail in the Blu-ray presentation. Night scenes particularly benefit from the high def presentation here. Whether or not you'll enjoy the presentation is based on what your expectations of the look of the show should be in high def.

The lossless presentation sounds marvelous with a nice, active soundstage. Dialogue is clear throughout.

The special features include the 13 minutes that were cut from the revised second season premiere. These scenes along with the rest of the deleted scenes include commentary from wrtier/producer/showrunner Glen Mazzara discussing the reasons why he felt the scenes didn't work and why they were cut. Those 13 minutes make for a fascinating alternate opening for the second season opener. It's a pity that they eliminated the stand-alone epiosde that Darabont planned which would have told us about the man in the tank from season one (much like the webisodes that told us about bicycle girl from the first season--the first zombie that Rick encountered after leaving the hospital that was half eaten and yet still alive. I'd love to see more of these). Working with those budget cuts did impact the quality of the season as well as the narrative making the second season more static than the first.

We also get five commentary tracks including Mazzara with a different combination of writers/directors (and with actress Lauren Holden as well). They are pretty informative about the decisions they made in shooting the second season the way they did as well as script decisions.

We get a number of featurettes: ""All The Guts Inside"", ""Live or Let Die"", ""The Meat of the Music"", ""Fire on Set"", ""The Ink is Alive"", ""The Sound of Effects"", ""In The Dead of Water"", ""You Could Make A Killing"",""She Will Fight"", ""Extras Wardrobe"" and ""The Cast Of Season Two"" focuses on everything from make up effects, the music score, the sound effects, the change of the character of Andrea over the course of the second season and the cast discussing the challenges of the second season.

Unlike the original first season set, this set comes packed with special features. The transfer looks gritty and coarse but that's how it is supposed to look. Character development is truly the star for the second season of ""The Walking Dead"".

when the world breaks and you have the choice of making new rules to live by or going down. This is an
absolutely brilliant series, because the characters are richly drawn. You may find yourself admiring
someone you at first hated, or mistrusting someone you believed in absolutely. I thought this second
season was particularly interesting because so often I thought what someone was doing--which would
affect the survival of the others--was so utterly wrong. You get incredibly drawn into the action
because the actors are so persuasive. It's almost as if you were one of this band of survivors, depending
for your life on someone who might at any moment make the worst possible decision. I can't imagine
what it's like watching these shows at intervals. I waited for the DVDs and then devoured them.",1346371200,,1108,4.867724867724868

Now on to the limited edition packaging. I received mine yesterday when I got home from work (great surprise). The box was huge but I couldn't see the item being that big-well it was pretty big (three boxes kind of like a Russian Doll effect); and when I finally got into the main box I was trying to suppress my excitement not trying to get my hopes up thinking it wasn't going to be that nice in person. Well I was definitely excited once it was out of the box! It looks SOOOO cool sitting on my shelf! And the quality is surprisingly good-my only concern was the screwdriver since that is made of wood (feels like wood anyways) so I get nervous when jabbing the walker in the eye to open it for the movie that it may eventually snap, so I think I will just keep the DVD with the rest of my DVDs and just keep him in all his glory showing off on my shelf.

I definitely thnk this was an awesome idea for them to do and glad I bought mine. I definitely recommend anyone who is a fan of the series to definitely purchase before they're gone and you're reduced to paying A LOT more on eBay or even from other sellers on here.

It appears it has a slight crack on the side base of the stand that holds the head. Not only that, but someone appeared to try to touch it up with some kind of glue or substance that left quite a mark all over the side. I decided to inspect the rest of it, the cd's and all. In the middle of all four cd's is some kind of paste-like substance smeared right where the hole is. I wiped this off without a problem but noticed one cd had some kind of warp-like dots next to the hole. The cd plays fine and the head takes the screwdriver like a pro so I really have no need to return it. It's just cosmetic damages.

The quality seems to be good, and it looks great! I especially like the way they have put the words ""WALKING DEAD"" underneath the zombie head in bold silver letters.
I made my purchase at BB, they had only one left in this big box, and the funny thing is the sales associate asked me if it was alright for him to take it out of the box and take a look at it out of curiousity since he had never seen one and I told him it was cool. He even took a picture of it on his cell phone. Then a couple who were buying a tv commented on how much they love The Walking Dead.
I've placed this scary looking zombie right next to my television with the screwdriver intact! So, if you have any doubts about it, I say just go for it since it might not be around for too long or the price my increase when the quantites are limited. I paid 60 bucks for it. I haven't checked out the bluray as of yet but I'm pretty sure it's going to rock as well as the sound in 7.1 Dolby Digital. All in all, this is very highly recommended!
Just an update: I looked at the figure again this morning, and I just wanted to say that the paint job on the zombie could have been a bit better and shinier perhaps as one person ( Craig ) has pointed out. He has definitely made some very good observations about the item even being somewhat different then the actual picture on the box, with which I am totally in sync! He's uploaded some excellent comparison pics and I have to say it now disappoints me to a certain degree seeing this! To be honest, it would have been cool to pay a few more dollars to get the zombie face exactly as it is shown on the box, but it is what it is I suppose!
2nd update: 9-3-12:- I wanted to add that watching it on these discs is so much better as you have no commercial interruptions and it really immerses you into everything. I just can't get enough of it. I'm on my third disc and loving every second of it! As for some who are complaining about picture quality, well, this is the way it was actually shot, I think it looks outstanding on bluray, the picture is clearer and the colors are well defined despite some grain now and then.
I have discovered one particular site where you can go and read up on movie/series reviews when it comes to picture quality and sound. They cover alot of ground on dvdtalk.com, thanks!",1346198400,,2584,4.118811881188119

I was impressed by the lifelike zombie mask included in Season One special edition,but, this special edition once again surpassed my expectations.
I was happy to see McFarlane was doing the bust, but it must be seen to be believed! It scared my 7 yr old so much that my wife is making me keep the head in my office. Is it worth the extra $?

This thing is top notch. I expected it to be made out of ceramic or resin. It is made out of a very lightweight plastic, but the design doesn't suffer at all because of that. If you've seen the quality of the McFarlane toys, this is equal to or even a step up in quality. It is around 80% of the size of a real head. The screwdriver acts as a lock, with one having to stick it further into the eye socket in order to open the head and expose the blu-ray discs. Very nice touch. The discs are well protected in a fairly heavy duty fold-out case. No booklets, other than advertisements, are included. The whole kit came very well protected in the box and had absolutley no damage.

This is by far my favorite special or limited edition case of any DVD or blu ray that I own.

Again another great pairing from Season One makes me excited for this episode. Why can't AMC do this with every episode? They fired Frank Darabont, but if you notice, every time they pair a writer or director combo from Season One, the episode is better. This time we have director Ernest Dickerson, who directed episode five of Season One, paired with not one, but TWO writers from Season One -- Robert Kirkman and Executive Producer for Season Two Glen Mazzara.

Episode recap:

A hoard of zombies follows a helicopter trail from the city into the country. The gunshot leads them to where Rick shot Shane. Now Rick and Carl are being pursued by this huge hoard of zombies that invade the farm. Rick and Shane lead some of them into a barn and set the barn on fire. The group fights them off. Hershel says he will die before giving up his land.

But there are too many zombies overpowering them. They have to flee. Everyone gets out except Patricia, who is killed, Andrea, who finds herself without a vehicle. Rick gets Hershel to leave. Daryl rescues Carol.

Andrea runs on foot off the farm and is miraculously rescued, after running out of ammunition, by a mysterious hooded figure.

Rick goes back to the spot Carol set up on the highway to meet Sophia. The remaining survivors make it back. Not everyone. Then they all drive away, as they need to stay off the main roads.

Rick runs out of gas. The caravan is in a vulnerable place. They plan to find a place to hunker down for the night and then set out again tomorrow after finding more gas and supplies.

Daryl shares with the group that Randall was a walker but wasn't bitten and that Shane killed him. Rick still hasn't told the group what happened with Shane.

Rick now shares something the CDC told him.

""We're all infected,"" he says. ""Whatever it is, we all carry it."" Carol and Glenn jump on him for not telling them sooner ""for the good of everyone."" Rick says, ""I thought it best that people didn't know."" He walks off like the weight of the world is on his shoulders. Everyone has been looking to him for answers to everything and it is clear that he is exhausted from the burden. The group also has trusted him less and less over time, questioning his decisions more and more, with the exception of Hershel and Daryl.

He confesses to his wife that he killed Shane and that he's glad Shane is dead. That he wanted it to happen. That he was tired of Shane dogging him and tired of Shane acting like it was his wife and child. He says that ""Carl put him down"" when Shane turned into a walker. Lori recoils from Rick, disgusted. Rick doesn't look like he cares what she thinks. He almost looks like Shane at this point, a little insane.

Rick at this point is a lot more blunt and pointed with his words. He isn't as kind; not as soft-spoken. He doesn't care as much about people's feelings. He still cares about keeping people safe, but I think at this point Rick's own feelings are getting blunted by being a survivor for so long.

People hear something moving in the dark outside camp. They talk about leaving camp and going somewhere safer. Rick demands that they stay. Rick says he never asked to be leader. He tells them about Shane. He shows them the door and says they are welcome to leave, but that if they choose to stay, that this isn't a Democracy anymore. They look afraid of him. This is a new Rick.

THOUGHTS ON SEASON TWO:

As Season Two draws to a close, one has to question the overall quality of the Season Two versus Season One. It just hasn't been there. And that is due to large part from AMC's firing of show creator and director Frank Darabont. If one reads about AMC's very public problems with its shows Mad Men and Breaking Bad, the Walking Dead is just another casualty on the list.

Frank Darabont was as irreplaceable to The Walking Dead as Gene Roddenberry was to Star Trek. But AMC did not see that, and the quality of Season Two suffered as a result. It is still watchable, but it was not the same as Season One. Fans adjusted, but no one can tell me that these episodes we have been watching are the same in quality. The budget has been slashed, the writing is not the same, and it shows.

AMC appears to have saved the entire season's budget for the finale episode. It was a great episode, AMC. Now bring us every episode exactly like it. You're getting the viewership. You're getting the advertisements. You have no excuse not to bring us the goods.

AMC, bring us writers and directors from Seaon One. It may cost a little more, but it is worth it.

From now on any original series on AMC should have a third party owning the series: that way the cast and crew have some protection from AMC's budget slashing and firing and unreasonable demands on the set, which have been well-documented on shows such as Mad Men and Breaking Bad. It is unfortunate that we the public have to suffer as a result. I wonder what kind of series we would have gotten if Frank Darabont HAD been at the helm.",1346112000,,5063,4.4294940796555435
4815888,5,B005LAJ23A,"I am excited about this episode, because even though AMC fired series creator Frank Darabont and therefore Season Two has not been the same as Season One, on this episode, we have as director Guy Ferland, who directed the finale of Season One, and Executive Producer Glen Mazzara as Co-Writer, so I'm crossing my fingers it will be a good one. And after watching it, I can say it truly was. I wish that these two would work together more often!

Opening

It opens with Dale's funeral, against a backdrop of Shane, Daryl, Andrea and T-Dog hunting and killing zombies. The creek is drying up; the creek was causing the zombies to get stuck and keeping them away from the house, but that is starting to change.

Between the new zombie threat and colder weather, Hershel has agreed that they can move into the house. Rick has also assigned tighter security outside.

Carl confides in Shane -- as long as Shane doesn't tell his parents -- that he stole Daryl's gun and that it is his fault Carl is dead. He tells Shane about how he taunted the zombie, the zombie broke free and he meant to shoot it but didn't and it killed Carl. He says he never wants to shoot a gun again and to give the gun back to Daryl.

T-Dog discovers Randall missing from the holding cell with the cuffs still hooked in the cell. We next see Shane pulling Randall through the woods, asking him where the rival group is. Randall says they are about 5 miles away and starts to lead Shane to them, and says that Shane will like living with them. Then Shane kills Randall and head butts him.

Back at camp, people are swarming looking for Randall. We see Shane watching the group from the woods with blood on his face. Shane hides his gun in the ground, then shouts to the group that Randall is armed, has his gun, and clocked Shane in the face. Rick and Shane pair off and T-Dog and Glenn pair off to search for Randall. It is all an elaborate ruse so that Shane can get Rick alone to murder him.

Daryl finds Randall and figures everything out. He knows Rick is in danger. Randall inexplicably reanimates as a walker but died from a broken neck.

The scene where Rick has to murder Shane is unforgettable. We know it is going to change Rick, irrevocably, forever. Harden him in a way that we have never before seen. It is heartbreaking. I have always loved that vulnerable, sweet side of Rick. He makes the hard decisions but also has a conscience. After tonight, innocence is lost.

Shane inexplicably reanimates as a zombie. Carl shows up and kills Shane the zombie. Awesome.

In the final scene, a hoard of zombies is closing in on Carl and Rick as grieving Rick bends over Shane's dead body, so they don't know the hoard is coming.",1346112000,,2723,4.458752515090543
4815889,4,B005LAJ23A,"Overall, Season Two continues at a much slower pace than Season One. There still is more dialog and more filler in the episodes. It is not the way series creator Frank Darabont would have written or directed the series if AMC hadn't fired him.

Still, this episode was okay as I compare it to other Season Two episodes.

*****SPOILERS*****

Now for a recap:

In this episode, we start with a brutal torturing of Randall as Daryl attempts to learn more about the rival gang. Daryl finds out there are about 30 of them and they like to rape women and children and have machine guns. A dangerous group. Carl sneaks in and Randall almost convinces Carl to let him go before Shane shows up and beats the crap out of him.

The group is trying to decide by sunset whether or not to let Randall live. Rick is afraid he will go back to his camp and lead the rival group to the farm and he thinks Randall should die. Carl thinks Randall should live and tries to drum up votes. He goes to Daryl, who has alienated himself more and more from the group. Daryl is disgusted by how he perceives Rick has turned a blind eye to Shane killing Otis.

Shane discusses overthrowing Rick's reign with Andrea, especially if Rick doesn't kill Randall. They talk about gathering everyone's guns and locking everyone in the house.

Meanwhile, Rick is looking for a suitable hanging place for Randall and looks at a high rafter in a barn. He tells Lori, ""I know how you feel about the death penalty."" This is like the Wild West and as close as they get to ""Judge, Jury and Executioner"" as they have no more courts system, and no trial. They are going to decide by sunset what to do with Randall.

Carl talks back to Carol and tells her she's an idiot for believing in Heaven and that Sophia is not better off dead. Carol tells Rick and Lori they need to control their child. Rick has a talk with Carl and says he needs to think before he speaks, and that he owes Carol an apology. Carl asks Rick if they are going to hang Randall in the barn. Carl wanders off and stops by where Daryl has been staying. He takes a gun from Daryl. He wanders into the woods and sees a zombie. The zombie is stuck in the mud. Carl begins throwing rocks at the zombie.

Dale tries to convince Shane to change his vote on Randall. Shane refuses. Shane says that if Dale does get the votes to keep Randall alive, if and when Randall kills someone, the death will be on Dale's head.

Carl continues messing with the zombie in the swamp until he is at arm's length from him. He holds the gun up as if to shoot him. The zombie breaks free, Carl slips and the zombie grabs him. Carl loses the gun in the forest and barely escapes with his life.

It is now sunset and time for a decision to be made about Randall. Everyone has gathered into the house for a meeting / to take a vote. Everyone is in favor of killing Randall except for Dale. They discuss keeping him prisoner, but argue he could run off. Dale argues they are killing him to prevent a crime that he may never even attempt (bringing back the 30 men, the rival gang, to their farm). They make the decision to execute him.

Later, in the dark, a very determined Rick presses a revolver against Randall's head in the barn when suddenly his son appears in the barn doorway saying, ""Do it, Dad. Go on. Do it."" At this moment, Rick completely breaks down and is unable to continue. He says, ""Take him away,"" meaning Randall. He looks at his son with tears in his eyes. He didn't want his son to see him as a cold-blooded murderer. He didn't want to think of himself as one.

Rick goes back to the expectant group, that is waiting on tenderhooks for news, and he announces, ""We're keeping him in custody for now."" Andrea immediately bolts, saying, ""I'm going to find Dale."" His wife looks at Rick and wants an explanation. Rick says about Carl, ""He followed us. He wanted to watch. I couldn't ..."" His wife finally understands. She says, ""That's okay.""

Dale is out on a walk. He encounters the zombie that Carl inadvertently freed while he was cruelly torturing it earlier in the woods. The zombie attacks and mortally wounds Dale. Everyone comes running. They call for Hershel. Hershel takes one look at Dale and realizes there is nothing he can do to save Dale. Rick, without hesitating, is going to shoot Dale in the head to put him out of his misery. But Daryl, somehow realizing the huge burden that has been placed upon Rick's shoulders, stands up and does it for him. ""Sorry, brother,"" he says to Dale, as we hear the shot ring out and the screen goes black.

Overall, I find the characters likeable, but the lengthy dialog scenes and the lack of action make me almost fall asleep at times. This is a far cry from Season One. While I find the show interesting, it is not a ""must watch"" as it was in Season One.",1346112000,,4820,4.345939933259177
4815930,5,B005LAJ23A,"The show itself is a great show, so I'll more do a review on the packaging of this one.  Neat concept, you must place the screwdriver in the zombie head in order to open it.  Realistic enough, although I think it could have been a little bit bigger.  Doesn't seem to be made too cheaply, and seems like it should last well enough.  All in all, a pretty cool collector item that I am happy I bought.",1346112000,4,398,4.12987012987013
4815931,5,B005LAJ23A,"Yes it's true, the best drama on TV these days features zombies. The second season of THE WALKING DEAD arrives this week on DVD and this is one series that not only keeps getting better but stays original and draws viewers in at a steady even pace.

If you missed the first season the apocalypse has come upon the Earth not in the form of war but in a virus that has brought the dead back to life with an unquenchable thirst for blood. As they attack the living each new victim becomes another member of the walking dead, hungry as those who turned them.

Into this world we saw Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) wake from a coma (he was a sheriff wounded in the line of duty) to an empty hospital. He struggled but found his way home to discover his wife and son were there no more and he set off in search of them, eventually reuniting with them and unaware that thinking he was dead his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) had taken up with his best friend Shane (Jon Bernthall). With a ragtag group of allies they headed to the CDC only do discover one last survivor there who then blew up the facility at the close of that season.

Season two begins with the group on the road once more heading towards Ft. Benning. When they get stuck in a traffic jam on the highway and their RV breaks down, they look for replacement parts only to have a herd of zombies head their way. For the most part they do well but two leftover zombies spot young Sophia and she heads into the woods. Rick follows, finds her and directs her back to the group while he distracts the zombies and then kills them. When he returns Sophia is no where to be found and the group spends their time searching for her. At the end of the first episode while they search, Rick's son Carl is shot by a stray hunter's bullet.

Episode two gets us to the place where the hunter lives, a farm with its own group of survivors led by the farm's owner Hershel (Scott Wilson). A veterinarian, he saves Carl and the rest of the group is brought to the farm as well. The search for Sophia continues and for the better half of the first season this is the focal point. It's what happens to the group during this search and after that brings forth the drama in the series.

The group changes as the show progresses. Secrets between various members are brought to light. Control of the group becomes a catalyst that drives wedges between these people. And slowly we begin to see Shane lose his mind. It's a slow burn that we watch progress from episode to episode that culminates with one of the most stunning solutions every shot in a series. This, along with the search and discovery of Sophia, makes for some stirring moments.

That may be the plotline that the story follows this season but it's the interaction between characters that make this series tick. Forget the fact that zombies are all around, the interplay between these survivors is what brings the story to life. The zombies take far less screen time then one would expect with a title like this. A true gathering doesn't even occur until the last two episodes.

Instead we have the drama played out by the love triangle involved with Rick, Lori and Shane. We have the development and maturing of young Carl in a world where there is no room for childhood. There is the fatherly affection between the older Dale and the emotionally scarred Andrea who begins to change as well. And in the midst of it all is Hershel and his family, thinking that there is still hope for a world to return to the way it was, secluded from the horror that has spun out of control in the world.

There are dramas on TV right now that have nothing on this series. As I said, if you took away the zombies the drama would still be the centerpiece and hold your attention. I considered if it would work in another format, say alien invasion or perhaps a world war on U.S. soil ala RED DAWN. In each format I choose the stories hold up. Zombies just add a touch of uneasiness to the mix.

The acting on view here is tremendous. There are no stand outs as every person involved brings their A game to the screen. From children to wizened aging actors, each does a fantastic job of bringing their character to life. There isn't a sympathetic character on view here, from the supposed bad guys to the amazingly good guys. And there are two things to know about every character here. One, they can change in the flick of an eye from good to bad and two, not everyone is going to make it. During one of the special extras sequences the statement is made that everyone comes to work wondering if their character will remain or not.

Words can not describe how amazing this series is. There were moments during season two where my jaw literally dropped and I had to pause the disc to absorb what just transpired.

In this episode, Glen Mazzara, the show's executive producer in the show's second season, steps up as writer once again. Mazzara has written two other episodes so far, including Episode Five in Season One as a co-writer. Also from Season One we have director Guy Ferland, who directed Episode Six in Season One. With only four episodes left for this season, I'm hoping for a good collaboration, and in this episode, we get a really good one. I wish they would bring back more of the writers and directors from Season One, as they had a real sense of what the show was!

I really enjoyed this episode. They built a lot of tension by knowing when to cut from one scene to another. Very nice job done by director Guy Ferland.

Episode recap:

In the beginning we see a chilling scene in which Shane locks himself in a school bus to escape zombies, and Rick is running for his life. No context is provided.

~~Opening credits~~

Then we see Shane and Rick on the highway. They are going to drive 18 miles out to drop Randall off to fend for himself. Rick stops in the middle of the road to set things straight between him and Shane. He tells Shane how it is: if Shane can't accept reality, how it is between Rick, Lori and Carl, then it is over between Rick and Shane.

Shane never really gives Rick a straight answer. He just starts talking about how bad things were when Rick was in the hospital, and how Lori and Carl kept him together. He says if he could take it all back he would, but he never actually states that he WILL take it back. Big difference.

They drive until they find a place that appears safe enough to leave Randall -- the Merit County Department of Public Works buildings complex -- except they do have to kill a couple of walkers on the property who are in uniform. There are bodies there that don't have scratches on them. And corpses. The place doesn't look safe. There are government buildings, which indicates a high rate of occupancy at some point. It is gated. We see the school bus from the opening scene, so already we know that Rick and Shane are going to run into trouble.

Back at the house, Beth, Hershel's daughter, has woken up. Her fever has broken and she is okay physically, but mentally she isn't. She is suicidal.

Back at the town, Randall is pleading for his life. Rick and Shane ignore him until he says he went to school with Maggie. Shane's first instinct is to shoot him, because he knows where the farm is, and he can take the attackers, the rival gang, to the farm. Rick stops him. But Rick and Shane end up in a life-and-death struggle as Shane says that Rick can't keep his family safe. Shane throws a very heavy object meant to kill Rick, but instead it ends up going through a window. It opens up a zombie nest. Rick kills the first one and the rest go after Shane.

Back at the house, Andrea tells Lori that she shouldn't have taken the knife away from Beth: that if Beth wants to commit suicide she should have been allowed to do so. Andrea is pretty cold-blooded. Meanwhile Maggie is having a heated family argument with Beth trying to convince Beth why she should want to live. Lori and Andrea have the bitch fight of all bitch fights.

Back at the town, Rick is fighting for his life and so is Randall, who has worked free of his ankle bonds. Rick and Randall leave, leaving Shane trapped in the school bus surrounded by zombies. At least, that's what we think. He's just getting the car. He comes back and saves Shane.

At the house, Beth argues in favor of suicide. She says it is better to do it now, while they have the choice, than when they are forced to do it when the farm is overrun with zombies. She asks Maggie to join with her in a suicide pact. Maggie is horrified. Then Andrea comes and offers to sit with Beth. Maggie insists she cannot leave Beth. But Andrea looks at her as if to say, trust me. I've got it. So Beth leaves and Andrea enters Beth's room. Then Andrea leaves the bathroom door open so that Beth can take her life. Maggie discovers Beth is locked in the bathroom and has slit her wrists. They find her in time. Andrea comes running from outside and wants to know how deep the cuts are. She says that since they aren't very deep, Beth didn't really want to kill herself. Maggie tells Andrea to stay away from Beth and to never come inside the house again.

Rick tells Shane if he is going to kill him, he is going to have to do better than that. And that he is going to have to trust Rick's leadership if he wants to be part of the group. And that Rick is probably going to have to kill Randall in the morning, but he wants to sleep on it.",1346112000,,4643,4.309633027522936

The reason I titled this ""Hurry Up and Wait"" is because that is what we have been doing all of Season Two. As of the end of the last episode:

Shane is set to go psychotic and kill someone. This has been this way for several episodes. When will it happen and who will he kill?

Lori's car is in a ditch and she may have been eaten by a zombie.

Hershel's daughter Beth is running a high fever: is she turning into a zombie? By the end of this episode, they have stretched this into two episodes going on three and no answer yet.

Will they have to leave the farm before Lori has her baby? (Pretty sure the answer to that one is yes: no way the writers are gonna let us stick around a year on the farm!)

We're also waiting for Shane to abduct Lori and Carl Grimes. Don't tell me you haven't been thinking it too.

If this were Season One, all of these things would have happened already, and we'd be watching these episodes as fast as we could to keep up with the plot points. Instead, we are watching a fog of dialog as the episodes pass in a slow haze, waiting for something to happen.

So now that is out of the way, here is my episode recap. The good news is, in Season Two fashion, it is setting the stage for some major events by the end of this episode. I do find myself looking forward to the next episode, but wish they would move the action along at a quicker pace. They don't have anything fast happening in Season Two like they did in Season One, and that continues to be a disappointment.

EPISODE RECAP:

Back at the farm, the group realizes Lori is missing. Shane goes after her. He finds her and Lori wants to go after Rick. Shane lies and says Rick is safe back at the farm. When Lori discovers Rick isn't at the farm, Shane says he didn't tell her because he wanted to make sure the baby was all right, which is surprising to everyone who did not know Lori's secret but which has suddenly become public knowledge. Lori tells Shane that Rick knows about her and Shane. Shane confronts her and says that their love was real and had nothing to do with a ""rebound"" relationship"" as Lori says it was. Shane has plenty of these obsessive moments and I think we can all see where this is leading: the guy is either going to kidnap or hurt Lori and Carl.

Rick, Hershel and Glenn get pinned down in the bar by gunfire by some of the friends of guys they killed. The attackers finally leave when the town is overrun by walkers. One of the attackers, Randall, is stuck when his leg is impaled on a fence. Hershel amputates the guy's leg to get him off the fence. They barely escape and take him back to the farm blindfolded.

Daryl has pulled away from the group and is living by himself since he almost lost his life hunting for Sophia. He seems resentful of everyone and aloof.

A group is mobilizing to look for Rick and Hershel: Shane, Andrea, Daryl, Theodore. Dale doesn't trust Shane's intentions and tries to persuade Andrea that Shane is not a nice guy, but she trusts Shane. Andrea tells Dale that Shane has done more for the group than Rick, which shocks Dale. Before the group can get started, a red-and-white pickup roars into camp, carrying Rick, Glenn, Hershel, and the new guy from the rival group, Randall. Hershel fixes Randall's leg and says he should be healed enough in a week. Rick wants to put Randall on the main highway with a canteen of water in a week. Andrea thinks that is the same thing as leaving him for the walkers. A debate ensues over whether Randall is a threat. Rick says no one is going to come looking for Randall; that his gang left him for dead. Shane counters that Rick is ""back in fantasyland"" and says sarcastically that he is going to go get Randall some flowers and candy.

Hershel steps forward and tells Shane that they haven't even dealt with what Shane did at Hershel's barn yet. He says that this is his farm and that he wanted them gone. Rick talked him out of it but that doesn't mean he has to like it. Hershel says that Shane should keep his mouth shut. Andrea follows Shane out.

It is clear that Andrea is a soldier for Shane, willing to do whatever Shane wants. She conspires with Shane about Randall: ""If he finds his people and leads them here, we'll have a war on our hands,"" Andrea says to Shane. ""You're preaching to the choir, girl,"" Shane says to her. Shane tells Andrea that Rick and Hershel are dangerous: ""They want to play house and they are bound to get us all killed."" Andrea responds, ""Then we have to stop that.""

Lori tells Rick that Shane thinks the baby is his. She says to Rick, ""No matter what, it's yours."" Rick accepts this and says Shane will too. Lori warns Rick that Shane is delusional and dangerous. She says that when Shane came looking for her, that he lied to her. Rick says, of course he did. Lori is upset about what he did at the barn. She says he has threatened Dale and Hershel, and that he is scaring people and scaring her. Lori thinks Shane killed Otis. Loris tells Rick she thinks Shane did it not just to save Carl but because Shane loves Lori and he thinks they are supposed to be together. No matter what. Rick says, but you don't know that.

Rick tells Lori he killed two people today because of Lori and the baby. It was Lori and the baby. No matter what. Lori warns Rick that Shane is not to be trusted. She says, ""You killed the living to protect what's yours?"" Rick says, ""That's right."" She says, ""Shane thinks I'm his. He thinks the baby is his. And he says you can't protect us. That you're gonna get us killed. He's dangerous, Rick, and he won't stop.""

Episode recap:

Immediately after the massacre of the zombies on his farm, Hershel demands the group get off his land.

Shane continues his out-of-control rampage at the beginning of the episode. He accuses Hershel of hiding Sophia from them (in the barn with the zombies), which grieving Hershel denies. Shane has the nerve to do this right after he has slaughtered all of Hershel's zombie ""family"" which, although zombies, Hershel thinks he can still save.

The group cleans up the zombies they killed in the barn. They have a funeral for Sophia and for Hershel's wife and stepson. The rest they burn. Hershel disappears and they can't find him. His daughter Beth, who appears to have been bitten by a zombie, has collapsed and gone into a catatonic state; and they need to find him. It appears Hershel may have started drinking again, as he has saved a large collection of his dead wife's things and kept them even when she became a zombie. Now that she has been massacred, it all seems to have been too much for Hershel to take. They find an empty flask, and Rick goes to check out a tavern in town where Hershel may have gone in search of alcohol.

But before Rick can take off, his wife throws the book at him, with guilt trips about his son, and saying Shane was right to clear the walkers from the barn, and begging him not to go after Hershel and to stop solving everyone else's problems: she says that her son needs him. Shane also tries to cut him off at the knees, and saying he was right in clearing the walkers from the barn and that Rick was wrong to try to stop him, but for once, Rick doesn't listen to Shane or his wife, and stands up to both of them, defending his own actions. Rick is finally certain that he is on the right path, and he is listening to his inner voice loudly and clearly. ""It's not just his problem I'm trying to solve,"" he tells Lori. ""We need Hershel for the baby,"" he explains. But we know that isn't all of it. Rick has also hinted that after everything they did to Hershel ... massacreing his ""family"" of zombies, his wife and stepson in the barn, Rick is going to try to make it up to Hershel and help him in his time of need, regardless of whether anyone else understands.

Shane is washing up behind the barn when Carol comes stumbling out of the woods looking disheveled and dirty and grieving. Shane sits her down and washes her hands and apologizes to her. He says he was just trying to keep everyone safe and he had no idea that Sophia was in the barn. He says that he is sorry about her little girl. Shane looks for a second like a lost little boy. But he still has that sociopathic air about him.

Dale is not happy about the massacre and not happy that others went along with it willingly and agreed with Shane. He talks to Lori about it, who tells Dale that she agrees with Shane that the walkers needed to be cleared from the barn.

Dale tells Lori that Shane is dangerous. He tells Lori that he believes Shane killed Otis. Lori doesn't believe him. She says Otis was killed by walkers. Dale says that Otis knew how to handle walkers: Otis was the one that was putting them in the barn! Dale says, ""I believe that Shane sacrificed Otis. I can't prove it, but I think that he shot him and left him for bait so that he could get away."" Lori looks dumbfounded. She tells Dale she doesn't believe Shane is a murderer. Dale argues that he can't prove it, but that Shane all but said it, all but threw it in his face. ""I knew guys like him,"" Dale said. ""And sooner or later, he's gonna kill somebody else.""

Glenn goes with Rick into town to look for Hershel. They find him at the bar and try to persuade him to come home. Meanwhile at home, Beth is getting worse and Lori feels it can't wait. She gets in the car to go to town by herself to bring back Rick, Glenn and Hershel. On her way to town she crashes into a zombie, flips and totals her car.

Rick can't persuade Hershel to leave the bar. He finally tells him, ""This isn't about what we believe anymore. It's about them."" (The group; their loved ones.) Hershel agrees, and gets ready to leave with Rick, when in walk two strangers.

They aren't friendly. They need a place to stay ... permanently. They are scouting for them and a larger group, and they are ready to kill for the farmland. Rick kills both of them.

Now we have an entire new cast of writers, none of them from Season One, and the series has suffered as a result.

Onto the recap:

*****SPOILERS*****

Glenn, with Dale's encouragement, tells the group about the zombies in the barn. The group is outraged and divided: Shane immediately talks about leaving, whereas Rick wants to approach Hershel about clearing out the barn, as Rick wants to stay because Lori is pregnant. Carol is not ready to leave as she wants to look for Sophia, as do many of the group. Shane is trying to convince them that there is no reason to keep looking for Sophia as in his opinion, all hope is lost of finding her alive. Shane and Daryl almost get into a brawl as Rick pulls them apart. It is always ironic to me to see a police cap on Shane's head.

Rick pleads with Hershel to let the group stay, but his words fall on deaf ears. Hershel wants the group gone from his land by the end of the week. Rick says they found the barn with the zombies inside. That they can help to clear the barn: that the zombies aren't people. He tries to tell Hershel if Hershel makes them leave, he is sentencing them to death. He tells Hershel that his wife is pregnant: that it is a blessing if they stay on the farm, but it is a curse if they are sent back out into the world. Hershel refuses to listen.

Meanwhile, Shane has set up a security detail on the barn in case any of the zombies escape. He did so without consulting Rick. Rick is considered the leader of the group.

Rick finds Shane and tells Shane that he is ""negotiating"" with Hershel. Shane overreacts and says they need their guns immediately or they need to leave. Rick finally tells him Lori is pregnant and that leaving is not an option. Shane immediately reiterates they need their guns. Rick says guns aren't an option. Watching Shane, we can see he is just not all there, not entirely sane. Also that he'd do anything for Lori. Which makes me wonder what is coming next ...

Shane approaches Lori and gives her this Stalker Speech about all the reasons he is a better partner for her than Rick, and why Rick is not meant to survive in this world. We can see that in every way he views Rick as a threat. It is chilling. By his words, we can see he wants to take Lori and Chad away from Rick, or perhaps have some harm befall Rick. Would he murder Rick in order to get what he wants?

Shane goes to get guns from the RV -- perhaps to murder the zombies in the barn -- and finds out Dale has hidden them. He is livid.

Meanwhile, Hershel has taken Rick on an errand: to rescue two zombies who are trapped in a swamp near the house. Hershel asks Rick how many he has killed, and Rick replies, ""Too many to count."" Hershel tells Rick, it doesn't matter how you have seen them in the past, if you want to stay on my land, you have to treat them as human beings. ""My farm, my barn, my say,"" he says to Rick as he hands him a tool to capture a zombie.

Dale attempts to hide the guns from Shane in the swamp but Shane finds them. Dale threatens to kill Shane to prevent Shane from taking them, but Dale, nice guy that he is, cannot bring himself to do so.

Shane hands out guns to the group and riles them all up, saying they need to clear out the zombies from the barn. Rick is not there to say no. Meanwhile, Rick emerges from the woods with a live zombie along with Hershel with another live zombie. This riles up the group with the guns, with Shane as their leader, and before you know it, it turns into a mob scene. They gather where Rick is, and the scene is just waiting for a match to light it.

Shane is the match. He begins to talk hate speech about zombies. He shoots one of them in the head, the one Hershel is leading. Then he takes the padlocks off the barn doors and lets the zombies go. Everyone in the group except for Rick, his wife Lori, his son Chad, and Dale begin to shoot the zombies until all of them are dead. Hershel, on his knees, looks shocked, like his family has been massacred.

A lone figure emerges from the barn. It is Sophia. She is a zombie. The entire group looks shocked. No one makes a move to shoot her. She continues to make her way toward them unimpeded. Rick is the one who finally steps up and puts her out of her misery. Daryl holds Carol back as she tries to run to her daughter.

The ending of this episode was very powerful. Another surprise twist - an unexpected ending. I do like these types of endings. Now if they could just speed up the overall pace of the storytelling and dialogue to match Season One's.",1346025600,,4982,4.170655567117586
4815972,3,B005LAJ23A,"There has been a tremendous difference in the first six episodes of Season Two and the six episodes that comprised Season One. For Season One, the plot developed at a blistering pace along with the character development. There was never a dull moment and I literally could not put down the series from the second Episode One began until the final second of Season One. Unfortunately, that same calibre of writing has not persisted in Season Two, and I believe that is why some fans of the series feel disappointed.

Yes, the timbre of the series remains: it is about zombies, our main characters are there, but the series is much slower paced. They have some episodes which have more action than others or that have a surprise ending. But I don't need to see 5 slower paced episodes with more filler dialog in order to see one episode with a surprise ending to make up for it. So far, not one of the episodes has equaled the calibre of the Season One episodes.

I feel that AMC is cheating us as the viewers for presenting Season Two like this. I would rather have had six episodes in Season Two and have them be written tightly like Season One than have 13 episodes that are written like mostly filler episodes with a lot of nonessential dialog and scenes.

Now for the episode itself.

*****SPOILERS*****

At the beginning, we see the doctor's wife feeding perfectly good chickens to the zombies in the barn. This is horrifying on three counts: One, she is feeding zombies. Two, in a world where food is scarce, she is wasting it on ... zombies. Three, everyone (except Glenn) is unaware she is feeding the zombies.

Glenn can't keep a secret, so he tells Dale there are zombies in the barn and Lori is pregnant. Dale confronts the doctor (Hershel) about the zombies, and Hershel says they are real people and he isn't going to kill the zombies in the barn. Hershel doesn't want Dale to tell anyone else, including Rick.

The group is learning to shoot. (I am wondering why they are using so much ammunition on target practice! I thought they only had limited rounds.) Rick knows the group needs to be moving on soon as Hershel has said now that Carl has healed, it is time for them to move on. No word on if they are continuing to look for Sophia. Lori is devastated when she hears the news that the group needs to be moving on. She wants Rick to ask Hershel to let them stay on. Rick says the best thing to do right now is to give Hershel some space.

Shane is teaching Andrea to shoot and is being a jerk. He gets Andrea rattled enough that she stops shooting and leaves the practice area. He tracks her down and apologizes. He then says he has a lead on Sophia and asks if she will help him check it out. She agrees to help him.

Meanwhile Glenn and Maggie go into town to get some supplies for pregnant Lori, who still hasn't told anyone including her husband that she is pregnant. Maggie gets attacked by a zombie and Glenn has to kill it. Glenn asks if Maggie was scratched and we as the audience are not sure. Maggie is glad he killed the zombie, even though she feels conflicted as she doesn't think any of the zombies in the barn should be killed. When they return to camp Maggie makes a scene in front of Lori about almost getting them killed and tells Lori to get her own supplies. Maggie throws the supplies at Lori's feet. Among them are a morning after pill.

Shane and Andrea are in a suburban neighborhood exploring a house looking for Sophia. It turns out to be a dead end. Andrea says to Shane, ""She never was here, was she?"" While they are looking, a lot of zombies suddenly appear outside the house and begin to attack. Shane and Andrea have to fight them off with gunfire, but Andrea's gun jams. As she tries to clear the jam, a zombie gets very close to her. There is some question whether Shane is going to protect her. Once Andrea clears the jam, she is remarkably cool under pressure. They get safely into the car. Andrea has no fear of zombies and is a great shot thanks to Shane's great coaching. He is a crappy person but apparently a great gun coach.

Andrea gets sexually excited by the andrenaline rush of killing the zombies and makes a move on Shane as he is driving down the road. If she only knew what a monster he was ... right? When they get back to camp, Dale is suspicious because both of them are acting ... funny. He confronts Shane about Andrea, and suggests Shane should follow through on leaving the camp. Dale also asks Shane outright what happened that night with Shane and the hunter at the high school and says Shane has been vague and hasn't given any real answers about what went down. Shane says Dale, Rick and Lori should be grateful; that because of him, Carl is alive.

Lori takes all three packets of morning after pills in a moment of spontaneity, then wishes she hadn't. She runs through the woods, sticks her hand down her throat, and vomits them up.

The confrontation between Dale and Shane continues. Dale says he knows what kind of a man Shane is. He says he wasn't there that night at the high school. But he was there when Shane had Rick in his gun sights and he held him there. He held him there, not letting him go. Like he wanted to shoot him. Shane looks for a split second like a cornered animal. But the right words come out of his mouth, even though he looks insane as he says them: he says that Rick is best friend. Then he threatens Dale and says he doesn't even like Dale; and gives the impression he may come after him since Dale is throwing accusations at Shane.

Rick finds the empty morning after pill packets. He finds Lori. He confronts Lori about not telling him about the pregnancy, but at least she has vomited up the pills. Lori also tells Rick about her and Shane. Rick has already known or suspected.

This episode contains a lot of material that continues to round out our characters, but it wasn't an earth-shattering episode. If I have to compare it to the episodes in Season One, it doesn't come close. I continue to care very much what happens to these characters, but I'd rather have Season Two in six short, compelling episodes than wasting the audience's time with filler.",1345939200,,6169,4.413368513632366
4815973,4,B005LAJ23A,"*****SPOILERS*****

This episode starts with another skillful use of a flashback, this time with the group stuck on the freeway back when Rick was still in the hospital in the early days, before they knew anything was wrong with Atlanta, as they watched in horror as the military napalmed the streets.

Lori realizes she is pregnant and doesn't know what to do with the information, and we learn that Daryl has seen a chupacabra on a previous squirrel hunting trip. Some in the group laugh at this, but clearly Daryl doesn't think this is funny and reminds the group that there are ZOMBIES around, so why is a chupacabra so far-fetched? Glenn continues to pursue the doctor's daughter, whom he has had sex with once in the pharmacy.

The group fans out in search of Sophia. Shane tells Rick in no uncertain terms that searching for Sophia is a waste of time and is dragging the rest of the group down, weakening them. Shane thinks they should call off the search. Rick is clearly in disagreement by his friend's opinion and at the same time begins to question himself. They argue, but they keep looking.

Daryl is looking for Sophia too, and shoots a squirrel while doing so. He finds Sophia's doll. Then a rattlesnake spooks his horse, he falls off and down an embankment and ends up with an arrow embedded through him and all of his weapons gone. He is all alone with no help and surrounded by a steep embankment in the middle of a river. He makes a makeshift tourniquet to try to stop the bleeding. He hears something rustling in the bushes. He manages to fish out his crossbow from the deep waters, but doesn't recover his arrows. The only arrow he has is the one embedded through him.

Daryl tries to crawl up the embankment, but falls again. Meanwhile back at camp, the doctor has discovered Daryl took his horse without asking. Daryl is now lying unconscious at the bottom of the embankment where a vision of Merle taunting him pays him a visit, plus a couple of zombies Daryl has to fight off. Daryl manages to pull the arrow out of his flesh -- painful! -- and shoots one of the zombies. But it is clear he doesn't have the strength to save himself and he will die out there. Merle's visit seems to have lit a fire under Daryl. He uses Sophia's doll as a torniquet. He eats the squirrel raw to get strength. Then he tries again to climb the embankment.

When he begins to fail, Merle again visits him and goads him relentlessly. Eventually Daryl struggles up the embankment and makes it to the top. It is still a long way back to the farm house. He is in the middle of the woods, injured.

Daryl finally makes it back to camp but Andrea, who is on lookout with a sniper rifle, shoots him, mistaking him for a zombie as he ambles into camp. Luckily she is a very bad aim!

In this episode we see what has become obvious to those of us watching the series: Daryl is not such a bad guy after all. He is in fact a hero of sorts. And Shane is the real bad guy in their midst. Shane is the one who wants to call off the search for Sophia whereas Daryl wants to continue it. Even though Daryl had Merle as a brother, Daryl is okay.

We can also see the doctor is becoming more and more uncomfortable with the presence of this group on his land as each day goes by. And then we finally see why: Glenn discovers a horrible secret in a barn: zombies. Locked inside.

As for the pace of this episode, it continues to be rather slow or medium-paced, unlike the fast-paced episodes of the first season. A couple of episodes, like this one, have a surprise twist ending. But the episodes themselves are rather slow-paced. It is clear from the first season that the writers are capable of maintaining a super fast plot development, and we are not seeing that in Season Two so far.",1345939200,,3774,4.386266094420601

I have review some of the videos of Season 3 and I can see where that is going too... out of the park. But it needs to retain the old characters, like Rick, Daryl, Adria, Carol, Lori, Carl, the vet, Maggie, Glenn...they are strong leader-like characters. For instance:

1) Daryl: he can evolve into the lead of searching for lost people, stealth attacks on the W/D, still a loner, develop a positive relationship with Carol, etc., he shoots first and asks questions later.
2) Rick: he can still maintain the leadership role, due to his compassion and matter-of-fact demeanor, needs to develop a more ""kick ass"" attitude too. I think Season 3 we will see that happen, especially with the secure prison environment, etc. He will have to kick ass more, especially with the incurrence of the new ""governor"" coming on the scene.
3) Lori: she needs to get in the program and support Rick and don't argue and be such a nemesis to Rick, she is the ""first lady"" so to speak to the leader, needs to support Rick more and stand behind him.
4) Carol: Daryl needs to take control of this woman. She is so use to being abused by her prior husband, she really feels like she is wanted when she is abuse, verbally and physically. She shows some selfish tendencies. She needs some sex to straighten her out.
5) The Vet: he will be the group doctor and support for Rick in the leadership area.
6) Glenn: He needs to gets some ""balls"" with his abilities and knowledge-base and Maggie needs to step up and support him; he is a good and compassionate leader that will help to support Rick.
7) Maggie: needs to support Glenn more and step up with her abilities, i.e., nursing, fighting, guns, whatever.
8) Carl: he is very good...he is developing a very good pragmatic attitude, like Daryl...shoot and ask questions later.
9) Adria: she is developing a more military bearing like Daryl.

Maggie's sister needs to let out to the Walkers. She is useless...like another unsupportive, whiny, child.

The Mishon character will be a great asset to the group, especially if she teaches her skills to Adria and others.

Basically, the group needs to be on the same page in their mission...SURVIVAL! They need to start grouping food, gathering munitions, food stuff, weapons, building secure housing, fortifying the housing area, building weapons, developing a medical system, providing a commodity for the survivors, and developing a monetary system.

Need a replacement for dead deputy...without the thinking with his genitals.

Personally, I am a survivalist. I think outside the box and develop the ""what if"" scenarios. I would develop systems to fix the probable problems that would occur in such an apocalyptic scenario.",1345939200,,2781,4.783333333333333

This episode is a bit slower paced than the previous episode. It still has a lot going on, but it doesn't have the quick twists and turns and surprise plot twists that I have come to expect of the Walking Dead. It has a bit of ""filler"" in it and a lot of dialog scenes. I won't go over every single point; I will just hit some of the highlights.

The group sets up at the farm where Carl Grimes is recovering in order to try to find Sophia, Carol's daughter. They have a funeral for Otis, the hunter who supposedly saved Shane's life (according to Shane). Shane is asked to say words during the service and he does: all lies. Shane asks Lori if she meant what she said about wanting him to stick around and she says yes, not realizing that he is thinking that she means permanently. Big mistake leading Shane on, even if you only mean it as a family friend!

The doctor asks everyone to give up their guns as long as they are staying on the property. Daryl goes off to look for Sophia. I used to think Daryl was the crazy one but now I think it's Shane.

I see the group's structure as follows: Rick as the main leader, with Shane and Rick as sort of co-leaders, but with Rick mainly in charge although he defers to Shane on some decisions. However, Shane is dangerous because Rick trusts him, he is psycho, and he has access to Rick's wife and daughter.

Rick asks if one of the group can keep a gun as a lookout, and the doctor agrees, so Dale gets to keep a gun. While exploring the property, Dale finds an well with a zombie in it. They have to get the zombie out so it won't contaminate the well water, but the zombie won't go for anything but live bait, so they tie Glenn onto a rope and lower him into the well. (!) This turns out to be a bad plan, as you will see.

They end up getting half the zombie out, so their plan of not contaminating the well by not shooting the zombie doesn't work. They still contaminate the well and have to seal it off or else all of the farm's water will end up contaminated.

Carol is despondent because they haven't found Sophia yet. On one of Daryl's treks into the woods, he finds a flower, a Cherokee Rose. He brings it back to Carol and tells her the story behind it. On the Trail of Tears, when many Cherokee women lost their babies and cried for them. The elders said a prayer and asked for a sign to uplight the mothers' spirits and give them strength and hope. The next day, this rose started to grow right where the mothers' tears fell. They called it the Cherokee Rose. Daryl tells Carol he believes that there is a flower for Sophia as he thinks they will find her.

Rick negotiates with the doctor regarding them possibly staying on their land after Carl Grimes has recovered from his gunshot wound and after Sophia is found, and the doctor says maybe. He had said they would have to definitely leave.

While in town gathering supplies, Glenn gets a pregnancy test for Lori, who takes it and learns that she is pregnant. Since she looks very upset, my first thought is, who is the father? Is it Shane or Rick?

Overall, the tone of this episode is much different. Past episodes in Season One have been extremely action-focused with a tense plotline packed with lots of story, twists and turns, and something new happening continously. This episode almost seemed to drag. In my opinion, they have 13 episodes in this season, and already the writers are seeming to almost luxuriate in having 13 episodes.

I want to see the writing remain as tight as it was in Season One. I am seeing signs that isn't going to be the case. That is unfortunate. We will probably still get a pretty decent series out of it. The characters are likeable, and the plot is entertaining. But the first six episodes of the series set all of us up for the ride of our lives, and we were all expecting so much more out of this second season, so seeing something like this is a bit of a letdown. It is overall okay, just not as good as I had hoped.",1345939200,,4001,4.279100529100529

One thing I like tremendously about this series is the camera work. This is very evident in the opening sequence of this episode. A man is cutting his hair in a mirror. It is done in extreme close-up. We find ourselves trying to work out time and place. Is it present day? Is it in the zombie apocalyptic time? Is it a flashback? Is it Rick Grimes? Is he having a shower at the doctor's house? ... The shots of the soap, of the cut hair, of the razor, all are too close to tell when or where this haircut is or even who the man is.

Finally, the camera pans back a bit and we are able to see that the man is Shane Walsh. His hair has just been all shaved off. It is somehow a very disturbing scene. We watch as Shane looks at himself in a mirror. We are left not knowing anything about when this has taken place.

The opening credits begin to roll.

Already the tension for the episode has built up!

The opening scene in the high school in which Shane and the hunter have to escape from the zombies is very good. Shane escapes but it doesn't look good for the hunter and we are left not knowing his fate.

Back at the farmhouse, I am enjoying this episode until Lori gives a speech about why maybe Carl is better off dead. Shane isn't back yet with the supplies and the doctor has not yet operated. But it doesn't seem in Lori's character to give such a speech. To me, it seems more like ""filler episode"" type stuff that writers stick in to fill in more time and it doesn't seem realistic, either. What mother wouldn't want their son to survive an operation like this? But she does explain that their friend who is dead now doesn't have to go through any of this ordeal anymore.

Now we are back at the school where Shane and the hunter have gone to pick up supplies so that the doctor can operate on Carl. Shane is about at the end of his rope. It looks like he is about to be overrun by zombies when the hunter shows up to save him. Nice work. Will they get back in time with the medical supplies?

Carl wakes up and his parents are thrilled until he starts going into seizures. He doesn't have a lot of time before the doctor needs to operate to remove the five remaining bullet fragments, and the doctor needs more transfusion blood. Rick undergoes a third transfusion at great personal risk (death) to himself.

Shane has injured himself. He and the hunter are still running from the zombies. Shane is having a hard time because of his leg. He keeps falling. He tells the hunter to go on ahead and leave him. The hunter refuses.

Back at the farmhouse, they have waited too long. They have decided to go ahead and operate without any of the necessary equipment needed to save Carl. The operation will probably fail. But there is no time left. Carl will die if they wait any longer. As they begin, they hear a truck. It is Shane. He has returned with the equipment. But the hunter is not with him. Shane is clearly upset and beside himself: we are under the impression that the hunter has saved Shane's life and gave up his own life for Shane's and Carl's.

But then we return to the shower scene, the one from the beginning of the episode. And we see what really happened at the school yard, what really happened when Shane and the hunter were running from the zombies. Shane shoots the hunters leg, shattering his kneecap, and fed the hunter, live, to the zombies. He murdered the hunter in cold blood. It was chilling. It was a reminder that we cannot trust Shane. He is not a friend to Rick. He covets Rick's wife and child, and he is a psychotic killer. The guy is deranged. Sure, we could say it was all for some supplies, but this is beyond that. Shane is certifiably nuts, at least that is what I think.

The last moments are Shane looking in the mirror at himself like a completely deranged psycho. Chilling.

Great episode with a surprise twist ending.",1345939200,,3896,4.313269493844049

I like the pace of this episode. It is quicker than the last episode, and things just seem to keep moving. There are a couple of spots where the dialog bogs down a little, but mostly things keep moving forward with very little filler.

The episode begins with a flashback: Rick Grimes' wife is discussing her marital woes with a friend in what is pre-apocalyptic times. In this case, it is the day Rick Grimes was shot and is right before Lori Grimes finds out her husband has been shot. Shane Walsh drives up in a squad car and tells her. Then she has to tell her son that his father has been shot. After this emotional interlude, the episode begins.

Rick Grimes is running through a field as fast as he can, carrying his bloodied son who has been shot. Behind him are Shane Walsh and the hunter who shot him, also running toward a house in the distance, where there is help waiting. Rick runs toward the house and there is a doctor inside, a nurse, and other people who first want to know if his son was bitten or scratched (standard procedure if you are in a world with zombies) and then proceed to operate on Rick's son Carl Grimes. Rick stands by helplessly watching, but knowing that these people are competent doing the best they can to save his son.

Rick staggers out to the porch. Shane Walsh runs up, sees Rick's face covered in blood, and tries to wipe it off. It is the first sympathetic gesture we have seen coming from Shane in awhile toward Rick and it is actually touching and believable, as I have thought for awhile that Shane might murder Rick if he had a chance. It is hard to tell these days what Shane thinks of Rick.

We learn that the hunter, Otis, did not see Carl. The hunter was aiming for the deer, and shot at the deer. The bullet passed through the deer and then hit Carl. The doctor informs us that the bullet is in six pieces. Rick is beside himself, wailing, ""Lori doesn't know."" She and the rest of the team are in the woods still looking for Sophia.

Lori and the team have heard the single gunshot, however. And Lori thinks it is suspicious. You don't use a single gunshot to put down a Walker, she argues. That is too risky. Her husband Rick wouldn't do that. So what was that single gunshot that they heard? It is bothering her, but they continue to look for Sophia.

The doctor gets the first of six fragments out of Carl and uses blood transfusions from Rick. Rick is weak from lack of blood, but wants to go find Lori, who doesn't know her son has been shot. They send someone to bring Lori to the farm.  Lori and Rick learn the doctor operating on their son is a veterinarian.

The doctor needs proper medical equipment to get the other five fragments out of Carl, as they are deeper. This equipment can only be gotten at a local high school, which was turned into an emergency FEMA shelter, but it has last been known to have been overrun by zombies. The hunter and Shane go after the supplies.

The main action sequence is stealing the equipment from the high school, which is a very tense scene. In the last moments we are left in a cliffhanger with the two of them barricaded in the high school surrounded and outnumbered by zombies.

Meanwhile, we watch as somehow things just don't seem quite right with Theodore, who is in the RV on the highway with a bad cut on his arm. He has developed a high fever. The rest of the gang has regrouped there. Is Theodore about to turn into a zombie?

We have to wait until the next episode to find out what happens to Shane and the hunter at the high school, whether they get the fragments out of Carl, whether or not they find Sophia, and why Theodore has this suspicious high fever!",1345852800,,3691,4.348837209302325

After last season's finale, The Walking Dead had a lot to live up to for a season opener. Looking at last season (Season One) as a whole, it was a tightly packed six-episode season that never allowed us to catch our breath. It was jam-packed full of plot and character points that kept us wanting more every second and was the absolute best for any adrenaline junkie into scifi or horror.

This episode slows things down considerably. There is time to breathe between scenes. Yes, there are still zombies coming after our band of survivors, but the tension is more drawn out, and things seem less dire and desperate. Our survivors have time to react to the zombies, plan their next move, and regroup. The deadlines/timelines in this episode do not seem as critical as they did in the Season One episodes.

There is a scene where Carol Peletier's daughter Sophia gets lost in the woods overnight as zombies have chased her. Rick Grimes came to her aid and attempts to draw them off, but then Sophia disappears. Quite a bit of time is spent tracking her down (it turns out that Darryl is an excellent tracker).

Meanwhile, Andrea overhears Lori Grimes talking to Shane Walsh, who is saying he is leaving the group. Andrea puts two and two together and realizes the two of them have been having an affair. She doesn't say anything to the group but does approach Shane and offer to leave the group with him as she doesn't feel like she belongs in the group, either. Andrea has been feeling suicidal since her sister Amy was killed and turned into a zombie. Andrea shot Amy in the head herself to keep her from being a menace to anyone else. Shane doesn't appear receptive to Andrea's offer but gives her no answer either way, so it is open-ended.

Overall, the episode feels longer than the episodes from season one due to a lot of added filler scenes: There is the scene in the church where they are killing zombies, and the scene on the interstate where they run into the zombie mob. There is the long breakdown on the freeway where they are stranded and have to get their vehicle running again and have to find Sophia. There is a lengthy prayer by Carol in the church that feels drawn out and made me yawn. Even Rick Grimes prays in the church in one extended scene. Somehow, throughout all of this, the episode just doesn't have the same fast-paced flow that the season one episodes did. All of these seem like filler plot devices by the writers to extend the episode. We had none of that during Season One. Therefore, I am disappointed.

I am still a fan of the series and will continue to watch it. For me it was a lag in the action throughout this episode and in the timing in several key plot points of this episode. I perceive it as a lag when writers feel they have a safety net (i.e., they did not know that Season One would be renewed: now they have Season Two and this time they have 13 episodes to write and fill). Newsflash: writers, don't write like you have a safety net. Write like this is your characters' last episode ever, and like you as the writers have to tell your characters' stories NOW. Today. Especially with a story like this, about a zombie apocalypse. Because today is the only thing that really counts in their world.

At the end of this episode, we get a huge moment ... which I suppose is supposed to make up for all of the filler we sat through throughout this episode. Rick Grimes' son Carl is shot as he approaches a deer in the woods. The episode is left as a cliff hanger, with Carl lying on the forest floor, and Carol's daughter Sophia is still missing.

Writers, please don't make us sit through all that filler to get to a huge moment at the end. Stay true to these characters or you will end up ruining this great series. I *still* liked this episode, but it did feel like I had to suspend belief about how my favorite characters would act throughout this episode. Several times they seemed to stay in one place longer than I thought they would, ruminating about what their next move would be, instead of the quick thinking and action that was so characteristic of Season One.",1345852800,,4144,4.479470198675497

The major strength of this television format is that it allows rich character development without the brevity and time constraints of a two hour movie. We get to know each person, their strengths and weaknesses, hopes and fears. Thus, we grow to care for these characters (some more than others), and this human drama, more so than the zombies themselves, was what kept me coming back for more.

The first season did a masterful job of keeping us emotionally invested in the story. While I still liked season 2, I personally found the middle episodes losing momentum. There is only so much you can do plot wise with being stuck on an isolated farm, and some of the character conflicts and zombie scenarios grew tiresome. By the time the umpteenth character wandered off by themselves into the forest or into town, I started to get exasperated as I knew they would soon encounter a zombie and struggle to get away.

Season 2 is the season that takes the characters to new places. Yes, I'll admit that the pacing dragged in some places but the pay off is well worth it. Here are the highlights of the season (potential spoilers ahead!):

Shane - Whether you love him or hate him, Shane's self destruction throughout the season is riveting to watch. Jon Berthal was amazing and I'm sad that he got overlooked at the Emmys. This was his season in a lot of ways.

Andrea - Another polarizing character, it is amazing watching her evolve to become such a strong person. Her fight to become self sufficent was sometimes frustrating but so rewarding in the end.

Hershel & his family - Hershel and Maggie are great additions that help our characters grow and change. They especially affect Rick and Glenn. Glenn comes to realize his self-worth with Maggie's help. Hershel's unwillingness to accept the new world actually helps Rick come to terms with leaving behind his good guy/cop ways. Rick is going to be doing a whole different leadership next season (Ricktatorship 2012!).

Daryl - You will be kind of shaken how far Daryl's character evolves from Season 1. I recently rewatched season 1 & I was amazed how calm he has become. This season shows how Daryl forms ties with the group that will definitely be threatened with the return of his brother.

Best Episodes: Save the Last One (ep3), Chupacabra (ep5), Pretty Much Dead Already (ep7), the entire second half of the season (eps8-13)

Best line that summed up the entire season: ""The pain doesn't go away, you just make room for it""-Andrea

So, if you enjoyed season 1 and welcome more character/survival drama then expect to enjoy this season even more.",1344729600,,1921,4.730538922155689
4816076,5,B005LAJ23A,"In all fairness, I must admit that, with certain exceptions, I am not a fan of horror movies or television series.

I am even less a fan of the ""zombie"" movie.  Frankly, I think they are silly.  [Sorry, George Romero.]

On the other hand, I love a well-written, intelligent script...even if it is in the horror genre.  Good writing is good writing, no matter where you find it.

THE WALKING DEAD may have been adapted from a series of graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, and there are plenty of zombies walking around and feasting in the thirteen-episode second season, but these decaying creatures take a back seat to the compelling human dramas that are played out between the survivors.

Because we, as an audience, come to care about these multi-dimensional characters, several of whom do not survive the season, when the zombies (aka: ""walkers"") do attack they are anything but ""silly"".  They are truly frightening.

Viewers who enjoy blood, guts and gore will not be disappointed, but unlike most zombie movies, that's not what this series is about.  In THE WALKING DEAD, story and character trump visceral delights.

I am not going to give specific plot details, except to say that this season not only finds the survivors taking refuge on a remote farm, populated by a veterinarian (Scott Wilson), his daughters and some neighbors, but there is also a deadly insurrection brewing within the core group.

All of the performances in the show are superb, as are the Georgia-filmed series' visual effects, make-up and other elements.  This is a first-rate production.

My chief concern about the program's future is: How long can the creators successfully continue the basic premise without resolving it?

Most shows of this ilk (i.e. ones with one continuing story line) run out of steam after a season or two and are better suited as ""limited series.""  Hopefully, the producers will not allow this excellent series to overstay its welcome.

The four-disc DVD from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes many extras, ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes, webisodes and deleted scenes.

4816078,4,B005LAJ23A,"I've been hooked on this show since day one, but Season 2 was (initially) a let down to me. Darabont left, the budget got cut, and some good ideas paid the price for it. When I first watched Season 2, I thought the plot was a drag and inferior to the incredible pilot this show had. The Sophia storyline was way too dragged out and rarely leaving the farm did little to give us a better idea of the world the characters are living in... HOWEVER, I rewatched all of Season 2 when AMC reaired it a few weeks ago, and I gotta say that when you watch the episodes in that rapid-fire way (in contrast to waiting a week in between episodes), the plot doesn't drag as much as I initially felt. Rewatch it and you'll see your opinion change about the pacing. I still feel Season 2 was inferior to Season 1, but it did enough to keep me entertained and looking forward to Season 3. Let's just hope that it paints a better picture of their world. If I hadn't rewatched it, I would have given this 2 or 3 stars. Lori still needs to get eaten, though. Hopefully in a very slow and agonizing way. Seriously, what was with her basically telling Rick to off Shane one minute, and then being all disgusted when he actually does it?

4816184,2,B005LAJ23A,"Season 1 brilliant... a zombie slasher with depth.  My girlfriend and I were riveted in a 5 hour netflix marathon so much so we opted to pay for season 2 here. Well... after watching the horrible implosion of the show in the second season I wonder if the entire writing staff either quit for better jobs or just made so much money they were too busy partying to care about the show anymore and what they wrote.  Any brilliance was long, long gone.

This season was full of stupid exchanges, manufactured drama, and completely drug out... an entire season at the farm?  In the end nothing redeeming and noting truly dramatic

Just one example of the rediculous writing in this episode and the season for that matter...

Rick and Shane... the dramatic climax of the whole season.  Ok they walk into the forest in open daylight, walk into the night almost instantly (obviously and very cheaply more dramatic) as Rick says they walk and walk, the whole stupid exchange happens and then the frickin kid shows up to see it.  Really?  He leaves the house full of people unnoticed and walks a long way according to Rick and just happens to find them and at the precise time to see Shane turn into a Zombie, save his dad, make a perfect shot at 150 ft, and become a man at the same time.  Okay bad cheesy writing and very lazy, but how about this.... even thoug Rick says they are essentially miles in the woods and this stupid kid finds them they turn and walk back and the house is a few hundred yards away. Competely pitifulwork here guys.  Then the gun shot and Daryl ""a tracker"" doesn't notice and just walks inside the house.  1000 zombies are a few hundred feet away in the woods and dad and kid don't hear ANYTHING to alert them until they are right next to them.  They turn and magically see the lights of the house start running in that exact direction with the zombie hoard behind them and in the next scene they ""are cut off"" and have to run the other way to the barn????  Did 1000 zombies alone not create enough drama that the writers had to put in this garbage??? Did the one writer go to lunch and not read that they were heading directly toward the house with an obvious clear shot and put this in?  How about burning zombies that have to be hit in the head to die...now they are afraid of fire and just stop coming?? Rick sets fire to a barn and goes into a hayloft?? Really he was never stupid and why now.... quite simply and yet again poor and lazy writing.

I could go on and on... the rally point, the gas thing, no supplies, a fire at night, a car big enough for the group, Rick's speach... all pitiful displays of writing.

Enough... like the Walking Dead writers I'm bored and ready to do something else tonight, but please please AMC stop this.  I really enjoyed season 1, it was brilliant, but we were forced to watch 13 painfully stupid episodes hoping for just a glimmer of what we all saw there and regardless of what anyone says it never materialized.  Simply in episode 113 or so of season 2 AMC finally found some budget for extras and had the zombie attack that should have hit the farm 8 episodes ago.

I obviously care or I wouldn't have just wasted 30 minutes writing this, but if it is not fixed immediately in season 3 I will write this off as complete and utter crap and enjoy watching the brilliance of season 1 over and over to get my fix of what once was.... good luck",1344211200,5,3403,4.337539432176656

4816223,5,B005LAJ23A,"Season 2 definitely is better - if you put down your adolescent penchant for the cheap zombie gore and scares (which get old).  Really - we have the development of what people do in a desperate survival situation - between daily life to crisis and how different people respond to it.  This season really starts to drive deeper with each character and does it masterfully.  Some make you scratch your head - you can understand their logic... maybe not agree... or maybe even be confused (which is excellent, the human mind is too complicated to be framed as simply as a lot of directors/writers do).  Anyways - GREAT series - it has elements that keep me interested as well as plenty of thought provoking situations.

4816228,5,B005LAJ23A,"3 Reason why I like this show and this review will make you want to watch it.
#1 Usually in zombie movies you don't really care about the characters but in the walking dead each character has their own opinions and are very interesting
Rick-Lori-Carl-Daryl-T-Dog-Glenn-Shane-Dale-Andrea-Carol-Sophia-Randall-Hershel-Maggie-Beth-Patricia-Jimmy-Otis. All these characters I love and are very interesting oh and not to forget Michonne.
And you can easily bond these characters and care for them.
#2 The zombies look very good thanks to Greg Nicotero who did the makeup to them. In zombie movies the zombies don't look that good but in here they look fantastic and thank god they didn't put zombies that can run and hopefully they don't ever.
#3 The story is so good because the survivors are put in this terrifying and new world as Dale says in episode 207 Pretty Much Dead Already. 'This world is ugly it's harsh it's a survival of the fittest. And the survivors have to face HARD decisions like whether to save or kill Randall or to look for Sophia or leave her out there. Also the zombies aren't the only enemy in this world. There is also bad guys out there like the 2 guys Tony and Dave who shoot at Rick-Glenn-and Hershel.",1341878400,,1225,4.838095238095238

This Season has its ups and downs though.

Ups: Great Story very suspenseful, Scary at some points when you see Carl out in the woods with a handgun and he sees a Zombie stuck in some mud and then the zombie gets out when hes 5 ft away from the zombie

Downs: only thing i gotta say was some of the people who died, it really got me going (Dont worry i won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen this season.)

4816297,4,B005LAJ23A,"How did Egg get this roll? Anyway, I wasn't really a fan to start with but box setted season 2 last week, and really annoyed it. I agree, that the plot progression was a little slow ""Sopheeeah, Sopheeah"" but you wouldnt want to get too close to any of the major characterers. As people have said, there seems to be a real lack of common purpose to the group as a whole, who are always quick to let their personal niggles get in the way of the not inconsiderable issues of surviving a global pandemic of zombiness. But, we must remember that this is not real, there are no such things as zombies, and this is a TV show. So, we have to allow the writers to compromise between story arc and action, and yes, it is like a soap opera, why shouldnt it be, soap operas are largely character driven, you cant have a tram crash or a terrorist attack in the burbs every couple of weeks, that would be silly. Part of the fun is that it allows us to imagine what we would do in the situation presented, and for me, thats the fun of it.

I'm not a fan of cop shows and talent shows, so for some near future PA stuff as good as this to be appearing on my tv, I am generally pretty chuffed. Well done to Egg and the lads and ladies, keep it up!",1341187200,,1229,4.05761316872428

4816610,5,B005LAJ23A,"I am a hardcore fan of ""The Walking Dead"" since AMC brought it to cable television. I am well aware that this series is based off of a comic book collection which is also available on Amazon.com, but never having really been into comic books myself, this show was just what was needed to spark my interest. I have already ordered all of Season 1, pre-ordered this Season 2, and Season 3 will continue in October 2012 following a teaser weekend in July 2012 on AMC. This isn't a series just about zombies. There is alot of blood and realism to what life might be like if there were a zombie apocalypse, and the various cast members represent real life people in todays world. The makeup and effects can't be beat, and even with all the blood and the fear of zombies, this series actually has a storyline which makes the horror much easier to tolerate for people who don't watch horror/zombie flicks because of the surprise fear factor. This is a must see series!!!! Get ready for season 3, the ""Walkers"" are coming!!!",1340150400,,1016,4.5271739130434785
4816611,5,B005LAJ23A,"In my review of season one, I indicated that I am not a zombie movie lover, I'm more like the ""oh geeze, there's nothing else good on TV, but there is a zombie movie on, so...., ::big sigh:: I'll watch it"" type of person.  I don't actively seek them out.  I have a vast dvd collection, yet do not possess one single zombie flick..... until now, (having bought season one of the Walking Dead a few months back). I will be increasing that theme ratio in the near future with more additions, even the one which frightened me as a child.... the original, old black and white ""Night of the Living Dead"".  I can look back now and see how campy it was, but it terrified me horribly as a wee bee and that may be why I did not become a huge fan of the genre.

What can one say about season two of the Walking Dead?  It's definitely not like season one.  But then, season one had only six episodes to draw the viewer in to this new world order.  It was expertly done and people got hooked.  Season two is dealing with growing pains, both onscreen and off.  It has more episodes to attempt to flesh out the storyline, and doesn't have that frenetic pace that season one did.  The storyline did plod along in spots, but it allowed us to get to know new characters and allow us to become concerned about them.  (I still wonder what happened to Morgan and Duane, whether we'll ever run across a zombified Jim, how the Vatos fared, or the Hispanic family who took off in a different direction).

In the search for one of their missing members, and also needing medical assistance, our group seems to have finally found the idyllic sanctuary they've been desperately looking for.  The Greene farm, which appears to have escaped relatively unscathed from any and all of the unearthly menace we know as the zombie apocalypse; seems like a little slice of heaven.  Honey, I'm home!!  Heck they don't even post sentries, such trusting souls they are!

Rick desperately wants his group to be accepted by the Greene clan so they can hopefully put an end to their travels by being able to set down roots on the farm.  However patriarch Hershel wants them all gone as soon as is feasibly possible.  Hershel expects the group to follow his rules while on his land.  As Rick starts to make positive progress with Hershel, of course, Shane has a tough time following those rules and soon Hershel's dark secret is known. Hershel's misguided faith and judgment, and how he wants thing done spells turmoil for Rick.  As Hershel doesn't see the rotlings as dead, but merely sick folks who at some point can be treated and get better, has Rick wrestling with what is the best course of action, when the decision is taken entirely out of his hands. The mid-season finale was a shocker.

The power struggle between Rick and Shane reaches fevered pitch at times.  Rick would rather contemplate actions before implementing them, where Shane is a man of action, and sometimes it's reckless action.  You can darn near smell the testosterone as it hangs heavy in the air when these two go head to head.  The group wrestles with a huge moral dilemma when they come across rogue survivors. Are they no better than those they're trying to protect themselves from?

Laurie is still her selfish and self absorbed self, (redundant, I know), allowing others to risk their safety in her behalf, while she seems to pass judgment on others in the group.... those who live in glass houses Laurie....I'm just sayin'.  Andrea becomes a force to be reckoned with as she learns to handle herself and a gun, and like Shane a bit reckless at times.  Carol has developed a bit of a spine.  Daryl is still AWESOME, using his tracking abilities to try and help locate their missing group member.  Glen finds a bit of happiness and takes risks that place him at odds with his new love interest Maggie.

Carl seems to have become absolutely callused to this new world, and these human beings turned into the walking dead don't seem to faze him at all, to the point of him wandering into the woods and teasing and antagonizing a walker who's stuck in the mud, or actively encouraging his father to shoot someone the group feels is a threat to their safety.  Dale continues to try to be the voice of reason and poor T-Dog just kinda seems to be there in the background.  He's really not doing that much this season.  Hopefully that will change in season 3.

We do lose some familiar faces this season, plus that beloved RV.... I LOVED that RV.... RIP... : )

Not as in your face as season one was, but in my opinion, still worth buying and adding to a collection.  I'll be adding it to mine.

You start to dislike some of the characters and find them annoying. Rick the lead character also kind of gets on my nerves that he always trys to save everyone. I also kind of wanted to see Hershel go down with his farm like a captain goes with his ship, but rick had to ruin it... The show also keeps around way too many unnecessary characters that should have been killed off much earlier in the show.

Shane was driving me nuts and now the hard ass bull headed alpha male is Rick; this doesn't serve the need for a new direction, in fact, makes me want to stop watching.  When you stop liking most of the characters, and start to grow weary of the re hashed drama (not to mention having seen enough zombies get a knife in their eye) well...But, that said I have been hooked enough to pay for Amazons mediocre HD picture and I have to admit, for the most part it has been very good with high production values.  Most series pieces lose me when I can hear the writers thinking ""where do we go next"" however, I do get the sense that there might be a new angle in store beyond the borderline tedious ""drama."" What I hope for now is the story widening to include a much larger scope of what the rest of the world is up to and perhaps solutions might begin to unfold.  Unlike the other reviews, I don't want this to go more than a 3rd season, however, a two hour season premire and a 2 hour final would be more satisfying than the short finals they have been giving us.

4816911,5,B005LAJ23A,"This was definitely the most exhilarating and intense episode of the season but it was the finale so what would you expect?  I thought the entire season was orchestrated magnificently.  I find it hard to believe the people who considered much of the season a bore.  Killing zombies and running can only get you so far.  The buildup with Shane and Rick was incredible.  Even though I hated Shane I found his character to be the most dynamic and interesting of the group.  It does not mean I didn't want to see him dead though.

The slack Rick took from his wife after his confession about Shane was utterly ridiculous.  Lori practically whispered it into Rick's head that Shane was dangerous and had to die in a previous episode!  Now I think that she would rather of had Rick die instead of Shane.  Honestly, I think her character should have been killed off instead of Shane.  It would have been nice to seen how her death would have impacted Shane and his relationship with the rest of the group.

The fact that most of the party disagreed with Rick's decision to keep the infection a secret was completely ludicrous.  Particularly Hershel's family.  How they responded after Shane forced the barn door open, and accepting the fact that the zombie infection couldn't be cured just doesn't explain why they would accept the truth about the ""plague"" being inside of everyone.  On top of the fact that there was hardly any evidence whatsoever prior to Shane's resurrection  .",1336435200,,1474,4.69921875

4816914,3,B005LAJ23A,"I love all things zombie and thought season one of the Walking Dead was good and showed a lot of promise for the series. Then season two came out and the creators seemed to forget this was a horror show and made it a soap opera. They camped at the farm for the whole season and you had to wade through episode after episode of painful whining and dragged out emotional scenes like you would on a daytime soap. What saved the show from being a complete snooze was the last few episodes where things started to pick-up.

Something snapped in the writers heads and they remembered that the zombies are the real stars of the show and they were brought back into the fold. So instead of an episode where they toss in the token zombie to wake up the viewers and remind us that a zombie apocalypse happened, the dead started springing up and became the driving force for the characters decision making.

No spoilers here, but the final episode showed some promise and introduced a really eerie/cool looking character that perked my interest. So I will stick with the show and see how season three plays out. I really hope they drop some of the drama and make the characters actions and behaviors mimic how they would act in the aftermath of an extreme supernatural apocalypse. I'm sorry but watching Glenn after everything he has been through clam up like a whimpering little kid when a woman wants to kiss him just doesn't fly. If anything he should be saying, ""Give me some sugar baby!"" This is what made Shane's character so awesome, he had depth and you saw him transform into a person hell bent on survival, he realized the situation and tried to change to match the new way of life.

The Walking Dead is worth watching. It does have some pitfalls (mainly American writers trying to plug family values and human emotion on a milquetoast level instead of making cutting edge terror/horror, something American Horror Story does well at), but the show does have a lot of potential and I think they ended season two on a positive note. I'll give it another season to see if they can deliver on that. If it doesn't, I'm such a zombie junky I might watch it anyways, but without very much enthusiasm. Basically TiVo and view it when there was nothing else to watch.",1336262400,4,2257,4.526960784313726

This show isn't just action packed with zombie slashing and head shooting; it is also packed with a story and character development which in my opinion, sets it apart from all the other zombie themed shows/movies.

Luckily the show varies from the graphic novel to a pretty solid degree, so we've had some surprises along the way, and this is a good thing.

On this particular episode, the song that begins to play over the closing credits really caught my ear.  The band is Clutch, whom I had heard of, but was not familiar with at all.  The track is called ""The Regulator"" from an album called 'Blast Tyrant'.  Just picked this up today and......Wow!

I went from season 1 to season 2 in one day. I just had to keep on watching to find out what's next? Who is going to die next? Where they going to go next?

I couldn't stop watching for longer than a hour. After finishing season 2 I was sad that I had to wait till October before season 3 starts. But knew I had to wait even longer before the whole season 3 finish before I start watching it. I hate watching week by week, so I won't do that and am very sad that I have to force myself to stay away from this series like this. But, I know it's for the better because it's torture for me to watch weekly.

Season 2 picks right up from season 1. Rick is trying to find the group of people to a safe place to stay. They end up at the CDC building and think they are safe there, when the doors are lock shut and no zombies can ever break in. They manage to get in, but later they find out they have to leave again for a different reason than zombies. Yet another character will die at this location but I won't say who.

Rick and the group now are back on the road and trying to find another location to stay safe at. They end up at this farm and they will be there until the end of this season. They are fairly safe at this location. But, what they are really doing is trying to locate a missing party member when they get to the farm. That is why they stay at the farm for so long.

When the group eventually leaves the farm, few people in the main party will die, but they will pick up new party member in the group going into season 3.

I really can't wait for this awesome series to start up and end, so that I can watch it all in one shot later on. :)

A typical series has 20-25 episodes per season and even then this would be too much for a great T.V show, which Walking dead is struggling to be.

Rumors abound that AMC fired Darabondt for arguing with producers about the lack of funding for the episodes. Then we get an entire season , stuck on a single set (the Farm) where anyone with half and eye could see the cheapness of the season as compared to the first. You could almost hear the AMC' Exec's saying to Greg Nicotero (the shows special effects wizard), now here is your zombie kill money this week, make it last.....

How about a real season of 20 episodes, and some serious money being put into one of the most successful cable series ever?? I seriously believe they are killing off major characters from the graphic novel to save on saleries. The making the DVD set so expensive?

4817135,1,B005LAJ23A,"I'd like to start by saying that I read the comic this show is based off, and I don't want to end up sounding like I'm just mad because the show isn't like the comic in anything but the most basic of ways.  I love the comic, and only found out about it when I heard that AMC was making this show.  That's about the end of me love affair with the television version of The Walking Dead.  Season one was okay, but a bit to short to really get a feel for where the show was going, and now that I've seen season two, I can say its in the wrong direction.

**You may find some indirect spoilers in here.  This review is more intended for a person who has watched the season but not yet purchased the box sets.**

I will never understand the obsession with taking a well written piece of work and adding in all these preset equations for how people interact and amping up the level of drama to points where I think a person might just flat out die of heart failure if they ever acted with such intensity.  You don't need people flying off the handle over nothing, and going from one extreme for good entertainment.  In fact, I personally feel that having characters with a more balanced basis of personality goes for more realistic writing.  In life, you don't have ""good guys"" and ""bad guys"", you just have people doing what they think is right to get what they deserve, and even if someone may be portrayed as an antagonist in the comic, they were always shown to have there own understandable reasons for there actions in these situations.  All I see in this show is people flying off the handle over every little thing, getting into well timed but pointless car crashes, and puking up abortion pills about eight seconds after taking them.  Most of these characters don't have a personality, they're just a walking pile of drama waiting to explode on the nearest thing that could possibly set them off.

Aside from just being walking piles of drama, I don't find the characters to be all that logical in how they operate.  I'm gonna put this one in a nice list for you:

1. Parental Supervision- Exactly how many times does Carl have to sneak out to almost get eaten by zombies before you keep an eye on him?  This is the zombie apocalypse, not the state fair.  He'll get eaten at some point if you don't keep an eye on him.
2. CDC Anyone?- Hey, do you guys remember that episode where they went to the CDC?  They met this guy who told them zombies are dead dead, and that they're not going to wake up and be magically better the next day?  Rick might have wanted to mention that to Hershel at some point.
3. Driving School- Road maps + Zombies + Panicking = Not good.  I get the point was the be a lure to make you want to watch the next episode to find out if she was going to be horribly killed, which amazingly she wasn't (surprise!), but at least use a little common sense next time you go out driving in the zombie apocalypse.
4. Sophia- That entire thing was just horrible.  A 12 year old girl isn't going to last very long out in the woods.  I can't really say what was less intelligent.  Her running away when she was told not to, or them assuming she was still alive after like a week alone.
5. Dale's RV- This may be more of a season one critique in some areas, but was it the best idea to go driving around in an RV with a busted radiator hose?  Couldn't have found maybe another vehicle somewhere along the way?
6. Andrea- I just have to say that everything this woman does makes about as much sense as well, zombies do.  Andrea has two feelings.  Emo, and RAGE.  In rare instances, she can combine the two into EmoRAGE where she tries to talk members of the group into applauding teenage suicide.  There are to many individual instances to list, but the entire character of Andrea in the show makes so little sense to me I can't even rationalize it all.

Now, to anyone who is going to say that people aren't always going to do the logical thing, and that stress can be a factor which would increase drama and irrationality I have to say that to a point, I agree with that.  The difference I'm trying to point out is that if they really constantly acted irrationally, like these people always do, then they'd probably have ended up dead already.

Another thing that gets me about this season is that they're trying to rush to many themes that appear later on in the comic into the show to early.  I'm not sure if this is to try to keep the interest of comic readers or what, but the show is just moving to fast.  Rick is a character who has, and continues to go through a very long and hard moral change.  He does his best to hold onto the values he had in pre-apocalypse life, but will do whatever it takes to protect his family.  This evolution is cut down from the course of over a year to the course of a few weeks, where Rick seems to go instantly from law-enforcing family man to sociopathic killer, ready to shoot anyone who even looks at him a little wrong.  The change happening over a longer period of time really makes you empathize with Rick more, while the change in the show only makes me question his sanity.

In addition to rushing the themes of characters it seems that just the show itself is rushed.  Characters are being killed of at a rapid rate that survive for much longer, leaving a lot of plot holes for how the show could have an resemblance to the comic in the future.  An entire family thus far was never introduced.  A lot of the character evolution is based on who you have to interact with, and with cutting these characters out or just killing them off so early, you cut out the potential for that same interaction to be brought up in the show.  I'm aware that the show isn't meant to be a copy of the comic, but at least holding to a bit more of the character interactions than just being in the same location once in a while could be nice.  Even the few scenes that are kept similar to the comic are so blown out of proportion with drama and craziness that they just end up being ruined.

The last thing I have to say, which I think is the culmination of pretty much all I've said up to now, is that this show just isn't what Robert Kirkman claims his writing style to be.  Kirkman writes to be realistic.  He tries to figure out how something would work, how someone would act, and then he does his best to deliver that in an entertaining way.  I get that in writing things can't always be 100% realistic, like zombies walking around for example, but trying to keep to that style is what I love about the comic the most.  A lot of the things that happen you really don't see coming, and that's what really makes empathize with the characters and enjoy the story.  All I have to say after watching how these people act in season two, I'm going to start rooting for the zombies.",1334448000,24,6822,4.281371784879189
4817136,5,B005LAJ23A,"I love this show, it's so powerful.  Was I the only one who was really glad that Rick told them off in the end?  I mean he played the good guy for so long, but they really expected him to be sorry that his best friend literally stabbed him in the back twice?  First he slept with his wife, but instead of backing off he kept pursuing her...And his wife, I can't believe she actually got mad at him for killing Shane.  I wanted to slap her twice.  His son needs a good butt whipping, and Daryl turned out to be pretty okay.  I started off wanting to hate him, but he's an alright guy.  T Dogg is there for what? I mean I like his character okay, but I would have rather him die than Dale to be honest.  And I can't BELIEVE they left Andrea.  That wasn't like Rick at all.

4817137,5,B005LAJ23A,"Okay first off, the story line and progression is slow because its a DRAMA. When i was suspended from school, and stayed at home and watched tv, i was stuck with watching soaps because we couldn't afford cable, and many of those dramas where sloooooww....So that brings me to this show, yeah its going to be slow, and i appreciate that, too many shows are fast paced and character development happens way too soon. I've seen all of the first and second season, and the show catches me off guard like no other. Some characters are obvious like Shane, but others like Andrea, to go from a weak suicidal person, to a stronger more independant woman was unseen. I figured Andrea would stay her suicidal self. Next comes Carl, a young boy who has seen way too much and gone through alot, he could have remained a weak character, but as the days go by he steels his mind.

Now to the comment about why Rick leting Carl approach the deer. Its common knowledge to never approach wild life in areas with potiential hunters, but heres the thing, its the mother loving apocalypse, they, including myself, would not exactly expect many hunters in the area, and regardless of Carl approaching the deer with the potential of a hunter, there's ALSWAYS that risk factor of a walker springing up and biting him. With that said, him approaching that deer was symbolic. It was an opportunity for Carl to see something that was beautiful in a world gone to hell. If i were a father, and I had my kid with me, and they saw a deer and had a chance to interact with it, I would give my kid that chance because who knows when he or she will ever get to see the wonders of life, when all this kid has seen is death.

For the characters acting ""stupid"" its SURVIVAL, like many have pointed out there are 2 police officers, they're the only ones who has been through life or death situations prior to the walkers. Many of you can think ""im ready for an zombie scenario"" but your not. You may have the equipment on standby, like shelters and bug out bags, but unless you've been in a life or death situation already (survival situation) then your not ready. Do yourself a favor and get out of denial because any army vetren (such as my father), will tell you that all your preparidness will be worth nothing unless you've been in a survival situation. A common person, such a lawyer, cashier, ect. will most likely act stupid, more or less because they haven't had the slightest clue what to do without the norms of society.

So unless all the characters are from the police department, military, national guard or any job that puts that persons life on the line on a day to day basis, I foresee the characters making bad decisions or being ""stupid"". People do dumb things when their scared and panicked.

To those of you who are my age (21) and younger, we come from a fast pace, instant gratification generation. But we gotta stop that crap, and slow it down, and remember that this is a drama. I appreciate this show because of its pace, I love watching old 2-3 even 4 hour long westerns where story line developes very slowly, I even like slow movies like the Big Lobowski. So learn to appreciate the pace, because if this show gets too fast paced like yall are wishing for...well your just going to dislike the show because it will turn into a mindless action flick. I honestly think this show brings back what alot of hollywood has lost. There are way too many cut and paste shows, I actually feel like im watching a unique show, rather than some clone with new names.",1334361600,2,3546,4.459167950693375

It was a season of consolidation, where the characters tried to find a way of leading a normal life in an abnormal situation.

It's about survival. That includes the zombie apocalypse as well as the breakdown of civilization and humanity as the characters know it. Watching them adjust to their new world and slowly giving up hope in a way back to what they used to know, that's compelling stuff. It IS on AMC after all, not on Syfy between SuperExplodingJellyfish and HauntedPlumbingBusters. That wasn't a pot-shot to the whole channel, though. Some shows I watch.

The herd finally reaching the farm was pretty perfect, and the loss of even more of the group was as it should be. Two things really stood out for me....Andrea deserved to live. I feel like she, ore than anybody else at this point, has come to grips with the world as it currently is, and is keen on surviving it. Seeing her running through the forest, desperate, out of bullets, and exhausted after what seemed like pretty much a full day of running and gunning was pretty gripping for me personally. When it seemed she was about to die, and then Michonne saved her (at least we hope. :)), i was like, ""F345ing ay. She definitely deserved to live."" and so i was glad she did. The other thing that stood out was Rick. In his efforts to lead everybody while trying to keep them happy, he lost sight of the fact that while people leaped at the opportunity to let him take risks, they then kicked back and scrutinized his every move, judging him....AS if they (Daryl and Herschel aside...and to a lesser extent Glenn) had actually done anything proactive themselves. So, when he tells them to take off if they think they can do better, but that if they stay, to understand this was no longer a democracy, i was like, ""About f'in time. Good man!"".

I went from season 1 to season 2 in one day. I just had to keep on watching to find out what's next? Who is going to die next? Where they going to go next?

I couldn't stop watching for longer than a hour. After finishing season 2 I was sad that I had to wait till October before season 3 starts. But knew I had to wait even longer before the whole season 3 finish before I start watching it. I hate watching week by week, so I won't do that and am very sad that I have to force myself to stay away from this series like this. But, I know it's for the better because it's torture for me to watch weekly.

Season 2 picks right up from season 1. Rick is trying to find the group of people to a safe place to stay. They end up at the CDC building and think they are safe there, when the doors are lock shut and no zombies can ever break in. They manage to get in, but later they find out they have to leave again for a different reason than zombies. Yet another character will die at this location but I won't say who.

Rick and the group now are back on the road and trying to find another location to stay safe at. They end up at this farm and they will be there until the end of this season. They are fairly safe at this location. But, what they are really doing is trying to locate a missing party member when they get to the farm. That is why they stay at the farm for so long.

When the group eventually leaves the farm, few people in the main party will die, but they will pick up new party member in the group going into season 3.

I really can't wait for this awesome series to start up and end, so that I can watch it all in one shot later on. :)

4817234,1,B005LAJ23A,"The first season of Walking Dead was pretty good - the pilot was brilliant and the following four episodes or so were really good. The last two episodes (the last one, especially) were pretty bad, but I figured that was a one-off and was eagerly anticipating season two.

WOW. What the hell happened? This show, in season 2, became everything that a bad show can be. It was poorly written, with bad, unlikeable characters saying annoying and idiotic things to each other. The situations were contrived and a waste of time to watch. It was illogical - look, obviously a zombie show can't be ""realistic"", but it needs a consistent set of rules. Zombies need to operate the same throughout. They can operate any way you want, but they need to be consistent (for example, 28 Days Later has zombies that don't act the way they do in, say, Dawn of the Dead, but it makes sense throughout and is a fine movie). The Walking Dead writers constantly broke the rules to fit their own terrible narratives.

I've heard people say that this is not a ""zombie show"", in that it's more about how people operate when the society they've known their whole lives falls apart. Fine. But it's HORRIBLE at that! The characters don't act like people, they don't say things people would say. They aren't even likeable. You don't need zombie attacks every minute, but you need something. This show has nothing.

Perhaps worst of all - it is BORING. This was not, I repeat, not, a fun show to watch. Season 2 was so stupefyingly boring I couldn't believe it. The pace was so out of wack, it just doesn't seem like something that seasoned veterans of TV and movies could put out. How can you make a zombie apocalypse entertainment product boring? Watch this season and find out.

This might be the most disappointing show I've ever seen. I mean this. It started with such potential and turned out so, so, bad. It's not even a little bit good. It's just awful. My recommendation is to just stay away from this season. If you need a zombie fix, find some movies to watch or play some Dead Rising (I think Dead Rising 2 is underrated).

The most critical character interaction for me was Shane and Rick.  The Shane and Rick dynamic has been a freight train heading for a catastrophic collision.  I actually found seeing these two friends finally have this confrontation, a conflict  that's been bubbling underneath the surface for some time, far more disturbing and more frightening than the possibility of zombies attacking them. Man vs. man... Taking a page from literature, I kept thinking of Shane as Shakespeare's Iago in terms of Iago's ability to deceive and misdirect Othello and others. (This is my observation after season 2 ended.) Watching this episode in light of how Rick and Shane's original relationship was depicted in season 1 before the apocalypse is ultimately heartbreaking.

I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it, but I wanted to respond because some people have responded so negatively about this episode and others this season.

4817302,2,B005LAJ23A,"I will say at the start that, while I read Kirkman's comics before watching any episode of the show, I'm not a long-time reader or greatly enamored of them.  But, I definitely appreciate the first volume.  In this episode, we finally get to the powerful moments of that book's final pages... and the TV script butchers it.  The main botchery is that the big ""reveals"" were given away several episodes ago, in a manner that makes me wonder if somehow marital secrecy has acquired a stronger taboo for screenwriters than those that used to apply to marital infidelity.  But, even considered as a self-contained unit, this does a gross injustice to the source material.  There's no sense of surprise in the final confrontation, even on the part of the characters, and without that, Rick just seems ""felony stupid"".  And THEN the most dramatic moment of all is reduced to an afterthought.

And then there's a technical quibble that's a big one to me: Given the amount of head trauma that even regular people have been known to survive (see the famous case of Phineas Gage), the ""shoot them in the head"" doctrine of the zombie genre doesn't make a great deal of sense.  (I've openly taken issue with this in my own zombie fiction.)

4817305,4,B005LAJ23A,"The biggest criticisms of season two are: slow pacing, too much soap opera drama (or as another reviewer said, ""too much talkie-talkie, not enough bitey-bitey""), not many zombies (until the second half of the season), Chandler Riggs (Carl) being an atrocious actor (but that's also the writers fault for not writing him more natural dialogue).

Season two is a lot different than season one, and I'm not talking about the premise. I'm talking about pacing and cinematography, and there's a reason for this change (but I'll get to that later). But first, let's talk about what season two is. Season two is about the farm. You're stuck there the entire time--that's something best known up front. In season one, there were essentially half a dozen locations--in season two, there's essentially three locations but doubled the number of episodes of season one. So you can sort of see there's a problem with pacing. But, pacing is the BIGGEST (and almost only) FLAW in season two.

The reason season two feels so different is because Frank Darabont (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shawshank-Redemption-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B000P0J0EW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Shawshank Redemption (Single-Disc Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Green-Mile-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B000P0J0EM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Green Mile (Single Disc Edition)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mist-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0010X73ZG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mist (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;) left the show. He was the main producer of season one, and directed the fantastic hour and a half pilot episode from the first season. Here's the thing: by theory, not a whole lot happened season one, but Frank knows how to do a lot with nothing. I mean, technically Shawshank Repemption and The Green Mile were not action packed films, but Frank knows how to get audience reactions. Glen Mazzara doesn't. Glen Mazzara is an action producer (The Shield) that, for some reason, decided to make a very slow-paced season two (especially the first half--I think we all can agree on that). So, the question is, what use is an action producer if he's not making an action TV show? *Shrug*

The second half of the season is when I really started enjoying it. Which is a shame, because I loved every episode of season one--and I only loved the a handful of episodes in season two. But season two is always the most awkward season. It's because it's in between one and three. I mean, let's look at books. How many people like Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets the most in the Harry Potter series? I bet there's a small handful. So, I can't completely blame Glen, because there are VERY FEW shows in which season two has been ""better"" than season one. Breaking Bad might be one of the exceptions, possibly Dexter.

Oh, and other than pacing . . . here's another big flaw: Chandler Riggs. The way Tom Hardy trained for The Dark Knight Rises, that's how the Producers of The Walking Dead needs to treat Chandler Riggs, the boy who plays Carl. I think all the fans of the show feel the same way; a lot of his dialogue is too forced; he tries to talk in a deeper voice than he has (and therefore hinders his acting ability); he doesn't know how to realistically act in front of Rick and Lori. Part of the problem is the writers of the show giving him lines that they should have realized that Chandler couldn't deliver.

I think this is a very subtle, almost impossible to prove theory, but it makes sense. Mad Men thrives off from its relationship drama; Breaking Bad thrives from its intense dialogue and emotional cliff hangers; The Killing thrives (well, it does have a second season) from being a mystery: therefore most of the audience, who are primarily women, who watch the show are pleased, because they want to be fooled over and over and over again. The formula is simple:

Equation: the killer who they thought was the killer wasn't the killer so there's another killer = The Killing (S2)

And The Walking Dead looks to its counterparts and . . . it tries to be like them, instead of being what it should be. Look at it this way, Rubicon (a fantistic, compelling show with rich characters, an innovative plot, and was exactly what it needed to be) got cancelled after one season, and the release date on the DVD/Blu-Ray? Your guess is as good as mine. This is what happens to 'shows that don't comform to the norm: they are assassinated. Maybe it's fear that is holding The Walking Dead back from being what it truly needs to be. In the entire second season of The Walking Dead, there are only two episodes that I thought were pure genius and fit the zombie ""vibe."" Only two out of twelve. So much of the first half of the second season was trying to build soap opera elements instead of zombie folklore/Survival Horror elements. The fall of Rubicon might have been an element in Season 2's inability to take risks. Although, like I said, it's hard to prove.

Ultimately, if season two of The Walking Dead contains all the episodes of The Talking Dead (with Chris Hardwick) then it's a must buy. But it's just not as good as season one . . . however, if you're a zombie fan, what else do you have to look forward to (aside from Resident Evil 6)?",1332979200,5,5395,5.101925254813137
4817306,5,B005LAJ23A,"This is like watching a very long movie.  I watched all of it in one day since their was only 6 episodes.  Perfect for the Resident Evil fan, add this to your collection of Zombie flicks.",1332892800,,187,4.166666666666667
4817307,5,B005LAJ23A,i must say walking dead is the best show on tv. its getting better each season love the cast the story line and everything about it. cant wait to pre order second season on blu ray. third season in october cant wait. i wish there were more shows like this.,1332892800,3,256,4.14
4817308,3,B005LAJ23A,"Or in another words: ""why is this still an issue?"" Is how I would explain this Blu-Ray release.
I'm sure the HD quality of Blu-Ray is the best way to watch the only prime time show about the Zombie Apocalypse, but it comes at a very slow narrative price. The first season of The Walking Dead was perfect. I will not waste time saying that because I had an absolute blast watching it the first two or three times. I was okay with the differences from the comic vs TV show in the short 7 episode season.

So naturally I was excited that season 2 was going to be longer with 13 episodes. Let's just say the confusion of Frank Darabont and other writers leaving didn't help the narrative situation. What they left before the mid season break was an absolute boring narrative that could be explained in 5 seconds, literally. I hate to be the reviewer that thinks this, but ""This show does have zombies, right?"" And yes, as a fan of the comics, I understand that it's not just about that, it's about how the main characters survive. It's neat to see the integration of Hershel, Maggie, and the farm come into the story, but that was it. After the mid season break, new writers and directors came into play allowing the story to progress a bit faster this time. However, after the drudgery of ""Where's Sofia!?"" God, it was hard to recover from that because the Walking Dead was becoming a chore to watch. And it should never be that! Jon Bernthal's acting was starting to get redundant with the constant head bobbing while talking approach. I'm from the south and I guarantee that not all of us talk to you like we have serious ADD problems. I had 0 issues with the 7 episodes of Shane in the first season. But the entirety of the second season of Head-bobbing dialogue? siiiiigh. My wife and I were yelling at the TV ""WHY AREN'T YOU DEAD YET?!"" Even Andrew Lincoln didn't help with his acting method.

However, the final 6 episodes did start moving in a better direction. Even though it was in a meandering path having the same issues of moving the narrative forward, it did get better. So Walking Dead or zombie horror fans, by all means, add this to your collection. You are still viewing probably the best if not only way the Zombie Apocalypse can be shown on Prime Time Television. Just expect this to be a boring chapter compared to Robert Kirkman and Tony Moore/Charlie Adlard's version. By the end of season two, just hope the show moves the narrative forward at an entertaining pace, not a stagnant one.",1332892800,6,2505,4.491228070175438

Give it a try if you on the fence or even if you think you won't like it. You might be surprised.

That being said, I wanted to address what I see as an issue specific to the Limited Edition Box Set. It doesn't seem to having any bonus features that the regular version won't have. Unless you're a collector you may want to avoid this version of the second season, at least until a version with more bonus videos and extras is made available for those who want more bang for their buck.

4817376,5,B005LAJ23A,"The Walking Dead is an adaptation of a graphic novel concerning the survivors that remain alive after a rampant virus decimates most of the population, turning those who died into flesh devouring zombies. We experience the daily struggle to find food, water, shelter, hope and other survivors, all while avoiding being tracked and attacked by the walking dead. This show is intensely dramatic, suspenseful, gritty, graphic and scary. An eerie, genius masterpiece. The characters are well defined and the production value is excellent. I love the way they carefully choose their color palette and frame shots to look as if they are jumping right off of the comic book page (graphic novel, technically.)

Even if you are a person who doesn't necessarily like the thriller or horror genre please give this show a try. It's unique, it's cleverly scripted, produced and directed, and it's about the end of civilization as we know it, highlighting our will to survive. Scary, scary premise!

 That was my review and these are my opinions! **SPOILERS!!!

**Never having been able to decide whether or not I liked Andrea in the end she really turned out to be a hero...she is one tough woman. And what in the heck are those armless slave creatures?! Anyone have inside info on that?!
**I agree that Lori is a total two-face! What a troublemaker! More of a monster than some of the zombies!
**Having read the reviews about Carol and how she is kind of a 'nothing' character, I understand how some don't like her but I'm rooting for her. Poor Carol, she's a battered woman. Think of her piece-of-crap-husband and how mean he was. Do you remember HIM?-- remember in season 1 the day all the gals were down at the lake washing clothes and laughing for once? How he swaggered down there to stop it and the violent confrontation that occurred? (BTW-I never loved Shane more than I did at that moment!!!!) I felt so bad for Carol and was really pleased when hubby Ed bit the dust. Anyway it's part of her character now to be meek and quiet but I predict she will emerge as an important asset to the group in season three.
**I've ALWAYS thought Daryll and Carol were meant to be together and in the finale it just so happened that he turned out to be the one to save her. Then she chose to ride on the back of his bike even when the cars were available. Mmmm--Will they be an item?

Let me say that I am sorely bummed out that it is over for now. I wish TWD was year-round. Can't wait for October.....",1332720000,,2485,4.575280898876405

The main Character Rick slowly became a mega DBag and completely unlikeable,they did nothing the whole season but sit on a farm Talking and occasionally killing a zombie or two....Boring!

Previously i was not a fan of the zombie genre, But walking dead has made me a believer. This can be attrbuted to the actual storylines and character development as opposed to just gore and zombies. After watching all of season 1 i could not wait for season 2. After the fist seven episodes of the walking dead season 2 aired, i realized i had to have more so i ordered the first 8 volumes of the comic book series and i can honestly say that i have never been more entertained and intriqued by a single series. Between The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Hell on Wheels, and Mad Men i can say AMC is more successful than they have ever been. I can not recomend this show more.

4817441,3,B005LAJ23A,"The inaugural season of The Walking Dead raised enormous expectations with its balanced blend of horror, action, and serious adult drama, coupled with high production values and hints that the series would play out on an epic scale. Season Two (aka ""Escape from Hershel's Boring Farm"") started to systematically undermine those expectations and change the very nature of the show.

The action and horror elements quickly receded into the background after the brilliant herd sequence in the season opener. Every drama needs rising and falling tension, but the show dramatically slowed its pace, focusing on life at a Georgia farm, and morphing into a rather overwrought soap opera--a sort of ""One Life to Live"" with the occasional token zombie. The show's setting became so confined that it was easy to forget that there had even been a total breakdown of society; Season Two just wanted us to take it on faith that there was something scary over the hill. And without the horror elements, the show in essence becomes an American version of the BBC's post-apocalyptic series Survivors.

Some rambling, repetitive writing and mediocre direction didn't help matters. (The lack of Frank Darabont's input this season is striking.) Those great ""Walking Dead Moments,"" where a character is stuck in a horrific situation and forced to make a gut-wrenching decision came less frequently or became so predictable that they ceased to make much impact.

But stick it out: by the end of the season, things are mostly back in swing, and the show we came to love from Season One appears to be more or less back on track. There are some shocking and heartbreaking dramatic moments, as well as unexpected deaths. By the final episode, the group is again on the run, fighting to survive both the walkers and their own worse natures. (The show is at its best when it balances both those threats.) Now, if the creators and directors can balance the ethical/psychological elements with a renewed integration of action and zombie horror, we'll be in for a thrilling Season Three. If it's just a group of frightened, selfish, confused people bickering in a prison, it will be a requiem for what might have been.

In Season Two, the makeup design is still superb, but the visual effects are still hit or miss, with too much of the spraying blood looking like dodgy, 300-style CGI. Audio effects are as comically over the top as in the first season: every time a walker is killed, it sounds like someone whacking a giant rotten watermelon with a sledgehammer. Once again, the show's comic book roots show, with characters performing utter miracles of marksmanship with the greatest of ease.

(Btw, what's up with T-Dog? Is he a ""Red Shirt"" the producers forgot to kill? The poor character had maybe three lines in the entire second season. Apparently he spent most of his time snoozing in a hammock behind the farmhouse. Season Three will tell...)

As for the Blu-ray/DVD set itself: be wise and wait for the inevitable Gold Platinum Extra-Special Super-Deluxe Edition that includes more extras than the initial release--as was done with the various releases of the first season.",1332720000,7,3154,4.952741020793951
4817442,4,B005LAJ23A,"Let me preface this by saying that I have NEVER been interested in zombie films or movies.  The closest experience I have to zombies is Resident Evil.  My boyfriend also hates zombies, and said they are the dumbest thing ever.  He said I would have to watch this show on my own.

So, I watched one episode and was hooked.  And the boyfriend was too!  As you probably know, the show is set in a post-apocalyptic United States, and the country is being overrun by zombies.  Rick Grimes, a sheriff, was in a coma when the apocalypse came.  He somehow managed to wake up and get out of the hospital, and was on his merry way to find his wife and son.

Rick ends up finding a lot more than just his wife and son.  There are places to go, people to save, mysteries to solve, and affairs and treachery to sort out.  I decided to take the gamble and convince my boyfriend to watch the first episode with me, and he was hooked as well!  And that is coming from a guy who has basically hated anything zombie he has ever seen (really, it was like pulling teeth to get him to give it a chance - and now he's dying for the next season).

And yes, I do see some very strong similarities to Lost.  I am not trying to get into a big debate on which is better or whatnot, but there are definitely some similarities worth pointing out.  Not to mention, I noticed these similarities way before finding out that it was a common comparison.  Plus, if you are a Lost fan (and there are many), this may engage your interest.  Here are a few of those similarities:

-a group of people who know nothing about each other live together and try to survive.  It brings up a lot of themes of loyalty, friendship, and the nature of people.

-the show is VERY slow-paced. I watched seasons 1 and 2 back-to-back so this wasn't really an issue for me, but I know it drove a lot of people crazy. Lost was also extremely slow-paced, with plenty of cliffhangers.

-it's so character-focused, that sometimes you forget about the other things around them.  Oh yeah, there are zombies in this?  I forgot for a second.  This show, like Lost, is truly about the characters.  How they feel, act, and the methods they take to survive.  The characters act like real people and I find a lot of empathy for some of them.  There are a couple of annoying ones, but there are still plenty zombies left in future seasons :)

-Rick Grimes = Jack Shephard.  They both start out as the model citizens (a sheriff and doctor) who are always trying to do what's ""right and noble.""  They take great pride in honor and try to be the team leader.  However, they are both highly flawed and begin to unravel and turn more primitive and scared over time.

-no one is safe!  Prepare for unfortunate and heart-breaking deaths.

Overall, I am very, very impressed with this show so far.  In this day and age, it is difficult to create something zombie without making it look completely goofy.  Yet somehow, the show is still scary, suspenseful, and has many layers to it.  I would say that if you liked Lost, you will probably love The Walking Dead.  Also, you do NOT need to like zombies at all to like this show.  Like I said, zombies often seem like the backdrop.

AMC is on a roll here.  Breaking Bad, Mad Men, and now The Walking Dead!  Too bad production for season three doesn't start until May!",1332720000,3,3336,4.349025974025974

4817446,4,B005LAJ23A,"This is a great little series IF you love getting the crap scared out of you time and time again and are tired of shows that always end on a happy fuzzy note. It's a terrible series if you value intelligent, thought-provoking dialogue and characters that don't stretch the boundaries of believability time and time again until you find yourself shouting at the zombie, ""Eat her already, I'm tired of her whining. And while you're all at it, pick up that holier than thou sheriff and his wife too would you????"" I really did try to dislike this series on that basis alone, really I did since I found the characters annoying and incredibly stupid in ways that defy even the most basic logic. For instance, Season 2 opens with our band of heroes (such as they are) stranded on an open highway. Now, they've been dealing with the walking undead for an entire season already. They should know this is a very, very bad situation. And yet, they wander around poking into vehicles while talking loudly acting as if it's just another Sunday afternoon at the park. When the zombies show up, as they do (they ALWAYS do) our little band is woefully unprepared for them. YET AGAIN. What happens from there could be called a comedy of errors, but I didn't find myself laughing. Instead, I kept reaching for the off button finding myself increasingly irritated and annoyed with the lot of them. But, like a train wreck or that bad auto accident that one passes on the freeway I found myself unable to look away. So I kept watching. I have to say as zombie shows go this one rocks, the walking undead are fascinating characters all by themselves, to heck with the human survivors. And who doesn't enjoy a good zombie show just for the vicarious thrill of seeing some undead former person slowly and implacably snarling and lunging forward determined to do one thing and one thing only, snack on living flesh! And oh the joy of screaming, ""Run already you idiots!"" as you get that first glimpse of a band of zombies around the corner knowing that the people are going to blunder right into the middle of them.

Besides I love a good survive against all odds TV show or movie even if I do tell myself time and time again, ""I would so rock that situation since I'm way smarter than any of these people."" And then I realize that part of the point of this series is that no, maybe I wouldn't be that smart. I might just do as many dumb, clueless things as its characters do. Why? Because they are human after all, ordinary people that may have been nice enough folks as you passed them on your way to a Sunday afternoon barbecue back when the world was normal. And yet, just like you they find themselves woefully, stupidly unprepared to survive in this new human eat human world. So do what I did if you're watching this series. Grab a good pillow or blankie to hold up to your face during the grosser moments, make peace with the fact that the human survivors are going to do dumb things repeatedly and cheer like mad for them and the zombies and place your bets on who wins with your friends. The one thing this show isn't is dull and boring and predictable. EVER. And in the end that's what makes this a great series after all in spite of its flaws. The fresh and the unexpected will draw you back time and time again.  Heck, right now I'm so hooked I have to admit I'd actually watch reality TV if it had zombies in it. ""Snookie, drop that dress and run. There's a zombie shuffling up the aisle straight towards you!"" So yeah, even though I keep telling myself I won't watch Season 3 when it comes out the sad truth is I probably will, at least until or if it gets boring and predictable.

TL;DR: DO NOT BUY, WAIT FOR THE S.E.",1332547200,95,657,4.857142857142857
4817448,5,B005LAJ23A,"When former showrunner Frank Darabont ""left"" THE WALKING DEAD before the start of the second season, I was extremely worried for its future. It seemed to be going in a very positive direction after only a few episodes in its first season, and much of that seemed to be Darabont's passion for the project as well as creator Robert Kirkman's desire to not slavishly adhere to his own source material. That was a surprising high point for the first season, since the comic itself is so amazingly good, and has several fans, that he would be more than willing to depart from his own material in order to keep audiences on their toes.

It was even rumored that a major cast member was ready to walk off set since Darabont's leaving, but who it was was never confirmed, and it certainly didn't happen.

But when the show came back for its first episode of the second season, it made a point of adhering to certain major plot points of the comic while keeping the relationships and characters fresh, and with Glen Mazzara as the new showrunner, it seemed like the show was going to keep going along with all of the forward momentum it had gained from the previous season. However, I had some concerns about the bonafides of Mazzara. He had been an Exec Producer on several disappointing TV series, like ""Life"", ""Crash"" and ""HawthoRNe"", but he was also an exec on one of the best cop shows ever, ""The Shield"". So, with any work on ""The Shield"" cancelling any of the poorer parts of his career out, it was looking like smooth scary sailing for this season.

Now, it's worth pointing out that THE WALKING DEAD has easily become the most contentious piece of genre television since SyFy's reboot of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. If you look at the internet after an episode, it's aflutter with conversations proclaiming it either one of the worst shows ever or one of the best shows ever. It's also worth mentioning that neither side is right. When an episode of TWD is good, it ranks amongst some of the very best TV has to offer. Episodes like ""Chupacabra"" where Daryl is stranded in the wilderness, ""Pretty Much Dead Already"" when the group opens the barn, and ""Better Angels"" as Shane enacts some of his solutions to some of his problems are some of the best episodes of TV in recent memory. But further more, there is another group of viewers that sound off even more frequently than either other group: The ""I'm Watching Because I Want It To Get Better"" group. This is the group with the most complaints, and in my opinion, the ones with the most validity to their claims. They want the show to have tighter writing. They want the characters not to be glossed over. They don't want too many 'Red Shirts' on the show (referring of course to the old ""Star Trek"" and how the nameless characters existed merely to get killed in an episode). They want the show to keep moving. There are moments that I agree with all of these statements, but I'm seeing what the show is doing (or trying to do) and am much more willing to forgive the show's occasional plot hole or deus ex machina or the ""This Character is About to Do Something REALLY Stupid"" moments in favor of the work being done by the cast, crew and creative staff.

However, it's far from perfect when plot and characters start to get bogged down from over-expository moments to a particular episode. Characters like Lori, Dale, Carol and ESPECIALLY T-Dog are essentially lost in the character arc shuffle despite the major things happen (Carol and Sophia, Lori and The Surprise, Dale and his staunch sense of humanity, and T-Dog and his... well... he did have that arm injury... yes, I'm essentially calling T-Dog a useless character bordering on being the ""Token Black Stereotype""). However, when there are moments of their arcs moving forward, they do so with tremendous momentum.

But even with Rick struggling to lead the group as a paragon of virtue, Andrea overcoming her personal demons and becoming a strong element to the group's assault force, Carl spending formative moments in the midst of far too many moral grey areas for a child to have to experience, the new character of Herschel and his staunch religious and moral beliefs and then having those beliefs shattered, and Glenn and his discovery of his more masculine side with the help of new character Maggie... this season belonged to one character: Shane. If there is a character that we can identify with the most AND the least, it's Shane. Here's a man willing to do anything to keep himself safe as well as the woman and child he loves. He also is willing to commit to an almost morally bankrupt existence so that he can do those things. Jon Bernthal proves to be the most versatile cast member for this season, and his arc is the most compelling. If Bernthal doesn't get an Emmy nod for his work on this season, it honestly won't make sense.

Speaking of the cast, there are several who shine: Jeffrey DeMunn as the ever-watchful ever-wise Dale, Laurie Holden as the struggling-to-find-her-place Andrea, Steven Yeun as the occasionally-wisecracking and romantically-challenged Glenn, Andrew Lincoln as the constantly-conflicted Rick, but the other two strongest performances besides Bernthal are Scott Wilson as Herschel and Norman Reedus as Daryl Dixon. Sadly, the weakest link to the cast is Sarah Wayne Callies as Lori. She didn't impress during her run on the show PRISON BREAK, and just seems too far out of her depth since most of her scenes are with other, better performances. Also sad are the criticisms of Chandler Riggs playing young Carl. He's actually not out of his depth here, and his character is that of a young boy who is trying to maintain some of his youthful nature despite the omnipresent death that looms around him in either physical or metaphysical form. He's reckless, impatient, irresponsible, and sometimes flat-out dumb. But surprisingly, most kids that age are like that, and I don't think that the character or the young actor deserves the criticism he gets.

From a technical standpoint, the effects work on the show is flawless. Greg Nicotero, who also transitioned into directing during this season, has supervised all the VFX and makeup and has done so with an expert eye for detail, even if some of that detail is EXTREMELY gory. Other directors like Ernest Dickerson, who's directed several episodes of this show, as well as many other shows such as BURN NOTICE, DEXTER, TREME, and most especially THE WIRE (not arguably the greatest cop show ever to hit television), shows a great eye for striking visuals as well as being a very good actor's director, which was especially proven in his direction of the season finale, ""Beside The Dying Fire"". Other strong creative forces kept proving themselves time and again this season, such as writer/co-producer Evan Reilly, who came from another favorite show of mine, RESCUE ME, and Kirkman himself who did his share of heavy lifting in the writing and exec producing this season, despite being the writer of at least three monthly comic books as well.

The only problem I have with the show consistently is the same problem I have with all action or genre-oriented entertainment: The unerring shootist or unlimited ammo UNLESS the moment requires them to run out of ammo, or miss to create tension or suspense. You see, characters walk around this show like Wild Bill Hickok in a John Woo film. Sure, there were moments when Shane and Rick taught the members of the group how to shoot, but BELIEVE ME, you still can't shoot a zombie in the head hanging out of a moving car no matter how many months you might have been practicing, and you can't fire 20-odd rounds of a 7-round shotgun. The only time the people miss or run out of ammo is when the story requires it, like reloading with a Walker creeping up behind you, or just grazing the skull of a fellow group member when if it had been a Walker, it would be a completely perfect headshot.

The most common complaint I hear about this show is the lack of Walkers. That is one of those complaints that I dismiss entirely out of hand. You want constant zombie presence and constant zombie killing, watch the RESIDENT EVIL films. THE WALKING DEAD is not just a zombie show, much in the same way that BATTLESTAR GALACTICA wasn't just a space-battle show. The characters have to interact and grow, especially in an environment such as this where society no longer exists other than in their own memories. Morality is something that appears to be the relic of a bygone era, and this is a land that seems to be ruled strictly by Darwinian principles. Concepts of good and evil have become luxuries, and the new law is survival. Some members of this group believe that very strongly, and some are shouting to the heavens that there must be a better way to live other than just survival. The argument could honestly be made either way, and more often than not, those are the moments when the show can either be at its best or it can wither away any momentum it had. The show is already great, but finding a balance between words and deeds will be how the show will live or die, but there are far too many smart and talented people behind this program for that to happen. The show has only had 19 episodes. Young shows will have growing pains, but when I rewatched the season finale, there were too many things that showed even more promise for the new season.",1332460800,20,9397,4.683414043583535
4817449,5,B005LAJ23A,"One thing that really struck me in this episode is how believable the setting.

The characters get dirty, go through more trials, and get even dirtier. I love that. So many shows keep their supposedly traumatized characters clean. They become exhausted from heat- I spent a good amount of time in that area and it is HOT. The characters are constantly affected by their environment. This is one way in which the series has so far been Uniquely Awesome.

The other amazing thing- they kept the SUNSET completely consistent!! WOW!!! So much of the action is happening in parallel, and keeping the shots in a consistent light- I'm impressed.

Also the last scene, between Carl and the deer- was amazing. Shane lifted his gun but Carl, still young enough to remind us of our humanity, wanted only to wonder at the deer. And he wondered at it while the men who had thought to kill it became entranced by it and by the boy's experience of nature. It was gorgeous.

Restoration and Denial of humanity is central to the comic, and I am so pleased to see it so eloquently played out here- and also in the episode where the Grandmother restores humanity to everyone and is the hero.

I realize the shows producers were establishing characters and that's important to story telling so I'm not complaining.  TWD has to be the BEST television series ever.  It is gruesome, compelling, disgusting, gory, well written, character driven with a dose of wonderful zombies thrown in for good measure and who doesn't love zombies?  The blood and guts is pretty graphic at times (just remind yourself the zombies aren't really tearing away at human flesh, that's nylons they're chomping away at) so the series isn't for the feint of heart but if you're into heavy duty carnage and adrenaline fueled excitement, this series doesn't disappoint.  At the end of season 2 Rick has become glorious Ricktator and I'm pumped to see what direction he leads the group -- and what members of the group will follow.  I'm a huge fan of Glen so (not having followed the graphic novels) I'm hoping Glen sticks around.  Can't  wait for Season 3!!!",1332460800,2,1290,4.885321100917431

Rig up some ""Trollhunter"" quality vehicles, make like a baby, and head out!

UPDATE AFTER FINAL EPISODE OF THIS SEASON: Okay, they've nearly redeemed themselves. A couple details I overheard at work lead me to finish the season, and turns out it ain't quite so bad.

I was thrilled with the farm scene, and Rick's wife makes some really stupid choices considering how intelligent she is represented as being, but those are minor gripes. Regarding the latter, it seemed obvious that her latest mishap was written in to bring about the end of her pregnancy. Dunno yet though. The bar though, that's really where this episode was at. I felt it did a great job at showing how despondent and hopeless things can seem. It also showed that regardless of circumstances, there are just simply some good people and some bad ones. Rick reclaimed some of his swagger there. Also, i really loved that they closed the episode with ""Regulator"" by Clutch. That is by far one of my all time favorite songs.

Now flip the show 180 degrees and have a show that's paced too quickly, all the characters are great and likable and non-stop action because hey who needs a plot. Get my point, no matter what the producers of this show do, they're not going to make everyone 100% happy all the time. To completely disregard the behind the scenes drama that took place in the production offices of the show would be disingenous. Realistically one or more actors left the show because of this drama, ultimately leading into storylines that may not have been but the one thing I have to say about the production is that it never lacked. Throughout this season I felt immersed within this world during the 40 minutes that this show was on weekly. As the characters were devestated by what was unfolding before them so was I and to me this is the benchmark of good storytellng in film, movie or any other artform that chooses to tell a story in the traditional sense. Couple this with great acting, writing and directing and for me this show being as amazing as it is becomes a no-brainer.

4817479,5,B005LAJ23A,"Rick and the other survivors in zombie land get shelter at a farm, after his son Carl is shot by a hunter on accident. Which makes season 2 a little slower with more talk and arguing at the farm through most of the season.
  However, the season has plenty of action, zombies and a scene full of tension when Rick meets two new survivors at a bar who also want shelter at the farm and don't want no for an answer. You also nave Shane getting more delusional to the idea of him, Lori and Carl living happily ever after if Rick was dead. While most of the season, Daryl is looking for Sophia, a little girl in the group who went missing during an early zombie attack in the season.
  Some fans complained that you just have the survivors at the farm bickering through most of the season and there's hardly any zombies. But that makes me wonder, what show were they watching ?? lol. There's still plenty of zombie attacks and if you want to see tons and tons of zombies at once, be patient, the season finale certainly has that!

When season 1 was released I bought it immediately, only to find a few months later that a better more fleshed out bluray/dvd was released.  This appears to be happening again.  I just want AMC and whoever else is in charge of these stripped down releases to STOP doing this.  You aren't doing yourself any favors by alienating and infuriating your core audience with sub par format releases.  I will not buy this version and neither should you.  Instead, wait for the better release that will come a few months after this one.

Season two definetlley doesn't hold up to the first in terms of zombies and action. It was more story based which is perfectly fine but at the same time some moments felt like they just dragged on and it got a little ""soap opera-e"". This season though, started strong and ended strong regardless of the slowness. I'm looking forward to whats to come in the third season and hoping this season was just a sophmore slump. Every show has at least one season that doesn't fit the calibur of others so i'll be buying this to add to my collection and eagerly wait for for October 2012.

4817523,4,B005LAJ23A,"The finale went off good. Rick finally grew a pair and blew off some pent up steam toward the group and their complacency with Shane and his wife.
Not too sure about the whole comic book direction it appears to be going in, but after all it was a series and it has to stay true to it.
I think the farm being overrun was a wake up call that they needed, the world they live in is not something they can sit back and forget about. The season did follow a soap opera type story line, but for what its worth, making an attempt get back to a normal life is really what these people wanted to do. Understandably there were some issues with AMC on money and everything else, and slowing things down was what they were really trying to do until things got squared away. But, looking at things from a realistic point of view, these are normal everyday people who had their world completely changed by something that they still don't understand. They are not highly trained military personnel who are skilled in fortification and survival techniques, everybody would kind of assume fencing would be adequate to keep a hand full of walkers out. The last thing that they thought about was a stampede. They are still learning as they go. I mean come on, look at Dale, the guy looked like he just came off vacation in his RV and the world went to hell on him. People don't naturally run around on survival instincts until something immediate confronts them, such as a lone walker walking around. These people just wanted to get back to what they knew as a normal life, to include relationship problems, which is an everyday ""normal"" occurrence. After a traumatic experience like the whole world turning into monsters, people need normalcy. They are not going to go out searching for more danger.
So there was a sense of reality in Season 2, despite how irritating things got for some. It really did at times seem like they were away from the real bad world, achieving what they were looking for, but no matter how hard they try, they keep learning just how hard it really is in the world now.....",1332201600,2,2082,4.481578947368421

Outside of Rick, Daryl, and Andrea however the other characters are weak. It's not a good thing when you don't really care if most of the cast gets killed-off. Now they will bring Michionne in, but seriously wt heck is she doing out in the woods with hundreds of zombies around? And old man Herschel with that 100 round pump shotgun was too funny. Rick needs to get serious and give Carl a good ol' fashioned butt-whooping for all the mess he's caused and Lori is a bipolar biatch who needs to be served-up as zombie chow. T-dog -what the heck good is he? He's always wanting to go off on his own, and never does squat. Just kill him-off already. Carol, seriously-- Sophia was more useful. And now that we know everyone's infected already, who cares if you turn into a zombie upon dying and not by being bitten/scratched. Maybe they will introduce a new twist here. Well, let's see what season 3 brings.

Perhaps the people who are alive are getting a little bit of their humanity back, or at least starting to be able to think and act like people.  There have been some MAJOR things that have happened so far this season.  I think is is going at a good speed.  I have a feeling they are working everyone up for something big.  I have no problem with this season.  The first season they were meeting each other and trying to find a safe place to stay.  Now that they have, things (though still dangerous) are as good at the time as they can have it.  They are making the best of what they can.  Plus, after all they have been and are going through, I guess they would be a bit dramatic.  How can you expect humans to deal with the things they are?  The end of the world, the end of most of the human race, a new unknown enemy with no brains just a lust to kill and eat them.  I like this season.  It keeps me on the edge of my seat, well the edge of my bed.  You can not expect action 100% of the time.  It's like life.  You get a little bit of everything.

Rick finally drops his nice-guy-mister-policeman routine and tells everyone to put up or shut up, squarely setting the tone for what lies ahead. A couple of major characters meet their demise and overall it feels like the cast has been resharpened to eliminate the less interesting characters and enable the more engaging ones to take up more screen time.

Personally, I couldn't have hoped for a better finale. This season at times became stuck at the farm and wallowed in the Rick-Shane love triangle story - the finale put these issues behind us and showed that the writers have plenty more material ahead.",1332201600,13,872,4.806666666666667
4817528,5,B005LAJ23A,"The mess hit the fan at the farm. Rick and his group found out the hard way about making noise and what that brings to the dinner table. They should have known from their experiences in Atlanta and up in the mountains what happens when they make alot of noise. The walkers encountered recently in the area (espeically since Dale was killed by one in the perimeter) should have alerted them that this was not a good time to be walking around at night.

With that said though, the last episode where Shane had created a problem for the group to have to solve i.e. Randall loose in the woods with a weapon had to be dealt with. If Randall had gotten away, he could have led his group to the farm, and there would be more problems than just dealing with a random walker to contend with. The turning of Shane into an insane person might not be indicative of the disease. It may just be that he snapped dealing with having to kill Otis to get out of the school yard, and his situation with Lori. Lori didn't help matters at all when she told Shane that the baby might be his. Her wishy washy back and forth mindgames with Shane drove him over the edge. In Shane's mind, killing Rick might get him Lori back, and he could finally have the family he wanted.

Now, back to this show.. The defensive perimeter of the farm was very untenable. The group was right to have broken contact and abandoned the location. That is not to say that they can never go back and retrieve things in the future though. The fire idea was not working out when Rick led the walkers into the barn in an attempt to burn them out. They likely would have burned to death or been eaten had the camper not pulled up next to the barn window. I am not sure why the driver just didn't pull out once Karl and Rick were on board, but hey, it was confusing at that point, and the boy was only 17 that was driving.

The female sword player in the woods was an interesting figure. You can tell it was a female by the body movement, even though the face was covered by a hood. the two chained walkers behind her was interesting, because they didn't appear to want to eat the person they were chained to. The two armless walkers just stood there like pets. Intriguing. Also, the torso of the swordsperson appears to be walker-like. Andrea was saved by the swordsperson at the last moment before she likely would have been killed. The fact that Andrea has the gun bag and ammunition is going to be a problem for the group in the future.

The group has been questioning Rick's decisions in this episode. The only person who is 100 percent behind Rick is Hershel. This makes twice that Rick has saved Hershel's life. The first time was at the bar, and the second was during the shootout at the farm with the walkers. Rick finally takes the gloves off and digs straight into the people who are questioning him. He tells them that he had to kill Shane to protect the group. He also finally tells them about how the walkers can turn without being bitten. The disease has already infected everyone in the group. It is unknown if a person can turn at any time, or if they have to die first. Currently, a person has to die before they can turn. This might not always be the case though.

The baby that Lori is carrying may likely be the first person born that would be immune to the disease. Just like the black plague in the 1300s where those that survived were immune to the ""black death"", and passed those immunities on to their offspring, this too will likely be the black death plague of this millenia. The look that Lori gave Rick when he told her that he had to kill Shane was very odd. It was almost like she was still in love with Shane, and was buying into Shane's b.s. of Rick not being able to protect her, Karl, and the baby and was secretly hoping Rick would die so she and Shane could be together.

I still believe though that the group of men Randall was with is led my Darryl's brother Merle. I do not think we have seen the last of Merle yet. The fact that Darryl is so central to the plot makes me think that in the future, Darryl may become the lynchpin in a serious plot.

Rick has started to go down the path that Shane did. I see in Rick's eyes that he may be starting to lose his mind. Is this the first stage before turning? becoming insane? Randall gave off the same vibe too. Remember when Randall at the public works went crazy on the walker on the ground? He was flat out nuts at that moment.

Now, on to the endgame. Rick lays down the law. Orders whomever wants to leave, to get out of the group and try it out on their own. There were no takers. The view over the woods of the prison in the background could be the fortress Rick has been looking for. If they can get into that Prison, their security is ensured. But, remember... a prison is never empty. Those that are in the cells before the outbreak, will likely still be in them now. They would have had no food. Likely, they would have died in their cells and turned. So, this place should be crawling with walkers. Also, there are guns and ammunition in all prisons. This could be the ticket they need for their security. Prisons have generators, fuel, vehicles, food and clothing. Everything the group needs to survive.

I am like, seriously? I think Rick handled things the best way he could and was forced to do what he did to Shane. While the group sat around and did nothing he handled all of the difficult decisions. Now they act like they don't want to trust Rick. That is why I am glad he said what he said at the end of this season. Rick followed by Daryl and Andrea are the coolest characters because they have what it takes to survive. I hope in season three that if they decide to ax more characters, the one that should go is Lori. What could have been the best scene ever was if she was bitten by Shane.

Searching for Sophia and a stale love triangle pretty much dragged this season down. Of all the moral situations a zombie apocalypse can explore, why choose the most used plot line on TV ever? In any case, I like where the show seems to be going now. I don't care what anyone says, Rick is a good leader when taking everything into account. Nobody else has had the courage to stand up and lead their little posse, and yes, that includes Shane. Shane was ruled by selfish tendencies, Rick makes calls based on what he thinks will be best for the whole group. Rick would have killed Shane a long time ago if this weren't true. Most criticisms I hear for Rick's leadership are based on hindsight, which Rick doesn't have the luxury of using while making his decisions. The fact that Rick is still as good as  he is says a lot about his character.

I'm liking how the other characters are developing as well with a few exceptions. I don't get how Lori is so stupid. One moment she's telling Rick that Shane is unsafe (a few episodes back), next she's disgusted with him for making one of the toughest calls he's ever had to make. What a dumb broad! And Carl is just as useless! All he does is get people killed or put them in more danger than they're already in and then flex some pretty crappy acting skills on top of it.

In the Walking Dead world, living is based on moment to moment, there is very little time to make decisions that will have any lasting impact. Man has been brought back to the Middle Ages (minus a few guns and cars) and it's been great watching how normal people deal with it. I can't wait for season 3!",1332115200,,1719,4.315789473684211

I thought this was one of the worst written episodes since a couple of snoozers in Season 1.  There is no fluid continuity to the story line.  The problem is that the downward spiral of Rick happens in one fell swoop and it makes it that much more unbelievable. See, with Shane he played the part of the Heel that was capable of doing good.  You saw how he slowly lost it through the last few episodes.  BUT Rick went from saving Hershel to turning on the whole group.  At no point in his slow devolving did Shane appear this malevolent, but suddenly in one night's span, Rick went from being the Moral Conscience leader of this group to a Totalitarian.

I know that many of you can rebutt by pointing to the trauma associated with having to kill your best friend, but understand, others in the groups suffered similarly traumatic losses.  This episode was the equivalent of eating morsels, AND then having your face overstuffed with food.  AND LORI! Wow just three episodes ago she talked about eliminating the threat (Shane).  I understand she had a change of heart last episode, but thru and thru she has stuck with Rick even when he has made the incorrect decision.  Now he tells her that he had no choice but to kill Rick, and she pretty much loses her mind.  Look I'm not asking for perfection.  I'm NOT one to point every single inconsistency.  I enjoyed last episode thoroughly for what it was (mistakes or not)BUT the writers did an absolute shoddy job of wrapping up what has been a fairly enjoyable season.  For other series, I understand the concept of 'moving it along' because of the constant looming threat of cancellation (Happened with V on ABC) BUT for Walking Dead and its immense popularity, I believe that perhaps a couple more episodes would have done the storyline and the introduction to next season justice.",1332115200,6,1841,4.621538461538462

I haven't read the comics yet, but who ever that was that made an appearance at the end looks completely incredible. There's so many questions that I want to ask about her!

It's episodes like this one that make getting through the slower ones worth it. This one and the mid-season finale were awesome.",1332115200,3,339,4.728813559322034
4817565,5,B005LAJ23A,"Okay...  So the ones that died I expected to die on the exception of Herschel.

Now I feel bad for Rick how the group all of a sudden turned on him when they were all ready to settle on the farm until this whole Helicopter business came up.  At first I was wondering how the Helicopter could lead the walkers from the city to the country side.  I know it wasn't that far out of the city, but still.  My friend said once they're going you can't really turn them from their path unless maybe if they hear another sound coming from another direction.

I think Rick keeping the secret from them about everyone being infected was justifiable since it'll probably only cause more panic or drive them nuts like Shane.  As stated above I feel bad for Rick and I think he deserves more respect than what the rest of the group is giving him including his own wife and son (minus Daryl and Herschel).

With all of that said I am excited for the prison saga and see who this woman that saved Andrea from becoming walker chow.

This episode took all the dullness out of season 2 and packed all the action, anxiety, nail biting (as someone said they were doing), keeping you on the edge of your seat feeling and just stuck it in this episode.  I thought Glenn was going to die just getting out of the car so he can drive since Maggie was having a temporary breakdown.  The way the camera angle was I wasn't sure if he was going to be attacked or Maggie was.

Please be kind to us AMC and don't wait until October :(

This finale rocked! Actually the last 3 or 4 episodes rocked!  Shane you will be missed.

Rick I hope you don't turn into Shane or we'll have to think of you as Shrick (Shane and Rick).",1332115200,27,1688,4.214953271028038
4817566,5,B005LAJ23A,"My only regret is that the season is over and won't be back until Fall. This was especially true since we got a brief introduction to one of the best characters at the end, Michonne, who wields a sword like Darryl uses his crossbow. I loved her in the comic books.

In this episode, the group at the farm encounters herding for the first time, which is a mass gathering of walking dead on the attack. This brings on a major battle with the inevitable loss of some characters. For those who enjoy battles, this entire sequence is really something with Rick and Carl having to set fire to the barn to kill some of the Zombies attacking them. Darryl fights on a big motorcycle with his crossbow while Andrea gets cut off from the group in the deep woods.

They learn a valuable lesson from this attack and that is that having a haven is not enough.  They need a haven with fortifications (a medieval castle and keep with a moat would be terrific but there are none of those).

Another thing that becomes crystal clear is that Rick is the group's natural leader, an alpha wolf type with his pack. There are so few survivors left in this new world that there will be no survival without natural leaders. Most of the other candidates for leading in this new world are borderline psychopathic killers so Rick is a rare commodity.

I can hardly wait for Fall's opening episode!

4817568,5,B005LAJ23A,"""The Walking Dead""... last nights finale for season two had some interesting moments.

1.) probably the greatest number of zombies in one show for the entire second season.

2.) loss of two more members of Hershel's family to the herd.

3.) Rick informs the group on the details of Shane's death and also tells them some stunning news regarding the Zombie virus... news he's known but withheld from them since they left the CDC center at the end of season one.

4.) a fast paced and harrowing ending... with the survivors just barely surviving and Laura being 'rescued/captured'. We are given brief glimpse at the very end as to what will probably be main locale for season three next fall.

5.) overall, great acting bringing a myriad of truly interesting characters to life.

6.) my only concern would be the soap opera quality of events that seem to be creeping into the latter shows.

Conclusion:
A great season finale and overall an incredible season two.
Best moment of the year... The 'barn' finale at the mid point of the season.

4817569,2,B005LAJ23A,"(do I need to indicate if there are spoilers or is it just understood, oh well) This whole show for the most part seemed to depict a somewhat sense of ""realism"" to me with many aspects. There weren't any instances of magic guns with unlimited ammo, there weren't really illogical twists, there was emotion with the death of friends and loved ones, and there was a feeling of doing whatever it takes to survive. This episode wipes away all of that. How can anyone be truly satisfied with that episode? The last two episodes of the season was like taking 80 steps backwards, after the previous episodes starting mid-season began to revive this show a bit. Herschel only had to reload his shotgun once? And just when a walker happened to be sneaking up behind him? Come on director et al, we expect better than Hollywood movie stunts. This show is supposed to be one with substance. Darryl is able to magically find everyone cruising along despite all cars going to the four corners of the world? Rick runs out of gas despite the fact that the last I recall, Shane's car had like 4 gas cans in the back before the attack, AND they had just left a highway of cars? Siphon baby, siphon! No one is really phased by the deaths among Herschel's family, except the one daughter? Andrea is dead to them- shrug it off. Is there no one of any moral fiber in the group anymore other than Darryl, Herschel's family, and Glenn? Please kill Lori.

Maybe the virus makes IQ's drop to the level of zombie-tude before you actually become a zombie. I blame the writers. Where is Quentin Tarantino when you need him.

""Hello, child and family services. My name is Andrea. Yeah, my neighbor next door -- her name is Lori. Yeah, I'm worried about her son Carl. Well, when her husband is not home she spends a lot of time with his best friend Shane - I mean I think something is going on there but it's not my business. Anyway, it was dark and late and she knocked on my door AGAIN asking if I'd seen Carl, and I asked her -- 'Don't you know where your child is at night?!' Well she's pregnant, using that as an excuse not to join our Neighbor Watch program, but anyway her son Carl is always out alone playing with those monsters down the block and I just think you should check on this child before he winds up dead.""

----------  THE GOOD NEWS -------------------------------------

Yes, the ending included all the zombies that should have been filtered into other episodes.

Yes, finally some action that should have occurred mid-season instead of the dry filler and horrible dialog fans were forced to endure. That farm should have been set on fire 7 episodes ago.

Yes, finally a real bad arse character from the comic book arrived and hopefully they don't dumb her down. She's smart enough to carry around two zombies (safely, read the comic book on how and why). And guess what -- she's from the hood [but probably actually knows where her children are]. YES!!!

4817621,5,B005LAJ23A,"The season finale of ""The Walking Dead"" was fantastic and really beautifully photographed and choreographed at times. It was very reminiscent of the type of episodes we got to see in season 1. In fact, this was the best episode since the pilot.

I couldn't care for most of the second season and its soap opera/love triangle/who is the father of my baby/the jilted ex lover going psycho/Days of Our zombie Lives stagy drama about basically two Alphas being engaged in a ""who has the bigger man? hood"" debate. Or that dumb kid Carl roaming around the farm during the zombie apocalypse unsupervised for no other reason than to move the plot along when convenient; or the trite, oftentimes idiotic and hollow dialogues apparently written by a bunch of college freshmen who still haven't taken a ""Writing 140 for Freshman"" class yet or read any literature or philosophy books other than comics it seems; or how the entire season was about those three above mentioned people and their petty problems while the other characters were grossly neglected and in fact were slowly moved to the background becoming mere props and scene fillers while Rick and Shane worked out the question of who exactly has ownership of Lori and Carl. I didn't care for any of that and most fans of the show didn't either. Season two was mostly slow and uneventful with boring episodes interspersed sparsely with real thought and engagement.

But the finale almost made up for all those comatose episodes. This episode was intense, dark, scary, heart-breaking and terrifying - all at once. I was nailed to my chair the whole time, which I can't say of any of the other episodes in this season really.

A few thoughts:

- Lori has got to go. She is selfish, unreasonable and ungrateful. An overall unlikable character and actress. Totally miscast. She is a terrible mother, disloyal wife, lousy friend and she's always treating Rick like crap. Even in the pilot, when Rick talks about her and what she said to him in front of their son and when she herself, in flashbacks, talks about her marriage and what she said to Rick, it is evident that she treated him like crap all the time. She slept with Shane a couple of days after her husband was believed dead but without taking any responsibility for it afterwards and then hid behind Rick to fix it. A few episodes ago she pillow talked Rick into getting rid of Shane or doing something about him, Now that he did fix it - and that only to save his own life since Shane wanted to murder him - she is all upset and disgusted and looks at him like he was the worst human being. Urgh. This woman. I cant wait for her to turn into the zombie she really is at heart.

- Carol is meek and annoying. I am tired of her victim, doormat mentality. She always complains, whines  and blames others for not doing stuff for her: whining to Rick, whining to Daryl. She never does anything but clean and cook and whine. Daryl was right ""What do you want?"" What does she want? She is stabbing Rick in the back for no apparent reason and questioning his dedication and leadership. Why? Rick only treated her with utmost kindness and respect, he never raised his voice on her. And it wasn't his fault Sophia got out from under the car and ran into the woods and then again moved even though he told her to stay put.

And yeah so he lied about the virus thing. That doesnt make him someone ""who is capable of anything."" I thought Carol's character was interesting at first but I don't see it going anywhere except for her just instigating hate and making people turn on each other. She strikes me as one of those people from the Salem Witch Trials who just screams ""witch"" and everyone listens to her because she is quiet and calm otherwise. I also don't get what the deal is with Daryl and her. What does Daryl see in her? And what does she want out of him? Love, romance, protection? What? I must say I don't see romance between the two.

- I like Maggie. I didn't at first but she is cool and she finally grew up and she has integrity too.

- I don't like that they are trying to make Rick sound mean or as some sort of a second Shane. They all looked at him like he was Ted Bundy when all he did was defend himself. I mean, the guy was being led to the woods to be murdered by his best friend who was after his wife and son. And people look at HIM like it was his fault. Rick gave everything for the group; he has character, integrity and loyalty - which is more than can be said of a lot of people here yet the first respite they get, they blame him.

 - Andrea is a trooper. I love her. She is the only woman who doesn't act like a stereotype and like she couldn't take a step without a man telling her or ordering her to - like Lori and Carol and those farm girls (except for Maggie). Lori is an idiot who defines herself based on the men she sleeps with it. Carol is meek, but Andrea, she risked her life to rescue Carol and she made her way out of that terrifying chaos surrounded by Walkers; on foot no less. She kept running and running and the whole time I kept thinking ""how does she do that, she is amazing."" She is a fighter to the last minute and she has character and is loyal. So it strikes me as bizarre that everyone is always interested in Lori and Carol and that throughout the whole decision making process she is never an integral part. They are totally underutilizing Andrea.

She has great leadership capacity and is overall just a great character. They would be dead if it wasn't for her. If Rick takes his head out of Lori's ungrateful a-$$ for once and stops being hung up on making her happy, he will see that and actually work with Andrea as opposed to ordering her around. I think they are all taking her for granted but they know that if push comes to shove, their next best ""man"" is Andrea. Remember Rick entrusted her with keeping an eye on Shane. He knew he could count on her and if you noticed, he doesn't talk to her the way he talks to the other woman. He talks to her like she is one of the guys and knows whaz happening. She should go out there with Daryl too taking down Walkers - they'd make a great team.

- Glenn is cool. I have always liked his character. He was made to be meek and weak halfway through season 2 but when it comes down to it, he is totally capable and just overall a great guy.

- Hershel is cool too. I forgive him his references to christ and the bible. He is an old man set in his ways and he views the world from that angle. Although I think he actually has come to terms with the fact that all that christ stuff is nonsense at this juncture.

I  sincerely hope the writers don't venture out into soap territory come season 3 and are able to keep a deft balance between character development and just the slow parts that then built up to something like we have seen in this episode. In fact, this episode is great because they have moved away from that petty party that was the farm and the love triangle. I understand that not all episodes can be about running away, but the focus of the show must shift from soap opera dram into survival and the walkers as another character, as opposed to the incidental backdrop for these characters to work out their petty quarrels. In other words, strike a nice balance.

I also hope they actually use Daryl, Andrea and the other characters more during the next season, develop them and their friendships and roles in the group. It is a shame a lot of them were neglected so badly that the actors playing them felt the need to quit. There is a great canvas to work with here and I hope the writers will see that.

So overall, cool episode. The best since the pilot. Really liked it.",1332115200,20,7689,4.331480194579569
4817622,4,B005LAJ23A,"Munch...Munch...Munch....Great Ending to the Second Season..and I am sure the suits at AMC are happy with the Ratings Numbers...Some fans (Me included) should familiarize ourselves with the rich material (as the comic book series spans a vast number of years) because as you saw with the Dark Hooded Figure who had the two Walkers on a Chain the series has only scratched the surface of the cast of characters the creators can throw our way...

Do I miss Shane...yes...but this Roller Coaster as not reached the top yet and it was time to introduce a new devil or two...yes I wish we could have kept Dale around..who will be the new Moral Conscience...Ricks little boy and wife will continue to take turns being antagonists in so many different ways...

The show is structured to keep us guessing...continuously...I knew Andrea was bad enough to survive...but to be rescued by an even tougher female (the hooded figure from the comic book series)says a lot about the depth of creativity for the series.

I think Shane's version of the ""infection"" was helping to drive him crazy...so Rick should step back and not feel so bad about what went down and the rest of the group should realize the same...there group has value..splitting up would not be smart.

Michonne, finally! And perhaps even cooler than her initial appearance in the comics. Speaking of the comics, I'll take a stand based on both them and the show: Rick is not that great a leader. Admittedly, I agree with his statements at the end of the episode: sure, there should be one leader who gives orders to prevent mass dissention and disagreement from corroding any kind of societal balance. I just don't think he's a good choice to be that person. Aside from his horrid parenting (just keep the loaded gun you STOLE from someone else, thereby endangering TWO people at the very least, and probably the whole group, you cute little psychopath you) he actually chose not to tell everyone there was a threat in their midst! What if, say Lori and Carl, were out walking and Carl randomly fell and died. She would be grief stricken... right up until his corpse reanimated. Or, maybe she could carry the body back to the group before it started ripping out throats. Right there, you sir, are not a good choice to lead. You kept people from knowing key information that could have saved their lives. I get that the others simply don't want the burden of leadership, even Randall's fate wasn't really an argument to get choked up over (I wouldn't have at least), but I wouldn't just blindly follow what Rick had to say  either. His decisions are questionable, to say the least. If you were driving for an hour in the red why didn't you mention it sooner, with daylight left to do something about it, and why aren't you taking into account other people's opinions? I guess I'm more with T-Dog's line of thinking: I'll stick with you people until something better comes along. In the time since Rick has joined the group no one has made any long-term good decisions, no fortifications, early warning systems, scouting parties, I would settle for even just basic armor. Seriously, wear a winter coat if you're going near walkers! (I take that back, they did it once in Season 1, then forgot what a good idea it is.)

Even so, all in all, the show is certainly back on track and actually making progress. Glad they took out those two people who I had to stop and think, wait, who are you two again? Otis's wife I think? Even Lori, whiny as she is, moves the story along. (Was she actually upset and disgusted with Rick for killing a man in self-defense who was himself a murderer, twice that we know of? Now I see why Carl is both so annoying and such a powder keg if she's been this patchwork crazy all his life.)

And here's a question, how many times does your camp/holdout/bar/farm need to be attacked and overrun before you stop and think, hey, maybe we need a back-up meeting place with provisions in case something totally unlikely happens, like a zombie horde migrating through, tearing down our nonexistent defenses? With any luck the momentum they've built over the second half of this season will carry on through to the next.

Seriously, I find myself sitting on the couch and cheering for the zombies, which I am pretty sure is not the way it's supposed to go down. But as the show has progressed over both parts of Season 2, I keep hating so many of the characters more and more. In fact, the only characters I am mildly rooting for this season are Glen, Darryl, and maybe Carl...that's about it. Everyone else is a stupid you-know-what, and I want the zombies to eat their brains!!! (Most hated character this season: Lori Grimes, hands down. She is such a *^#&(!!! And her parenting skills make Betty Draper from ""Mad Men"" look like Mother of the Year. I'm just sayin'.)

I guess you could say that my frustration is what Season 2 is all about. The zombie apocalypse continues, obviously, and virtually every character begins to lose it at some point (especially Shane...you have no idea). Ultimately, though, they all still piss me off, and I want them all to die and for the zombies to take over the world. And some of these moronic characters do die this season...and it's unexpected and AWESOME!!! Sadly, though, many of them will live to see Season 3. BUMMER. :(

Without giving anything away, here is my take on this: the first half of Season 2 was a bit disappointing. I thought the overall pacing of the show was slower than Season 1. The same thing happened in the second half of Season 2, and then the last 10 minutes of the second-to-last episode of the season were AMAZING, and then the season finale kind of sucked. I will watch Season 3, but I really hope things pick up a bit and that these characters get their acts together.

4817749,5,B005LAJ23A,"I hear a lot of complaints about the second season having turned into boring soap opera and not enough zombie actions.  It is true to some extent that the start of the second season may seem slow and yes, in the first a few episodes, we only got to see a few zombies get whacked for ""shock values"".  While I do agree there were fewer zombies than I hoped to see, this lacking in zombie actions in the first half of the second season are well made up for in the second half of the season.  So do wait for it; you will get lots of zombies.  Now about the show being boring because there is just bitching and moaning amongst survivors, I have to disagree.  Although I did want to see more zombies, the conversations and dialogues did keep me enticed. They were not just bitching and moaning.  They are studies into characters and their relationships which I find intriguing and captivating.  The reason is that I do like and do relate to them and that makes me care about them.  I think that in that sense, the show has done a good job, to have made me care enough to want to keep watching, because I want them to survive and keep surviving. Without the zombies physically appearing all the time, there are plenty of crises that will throw the survival of the group into jeopardy.  For example, what if Hershel really tries to have all of them thrown out the farm?  How will Rick handle the situation with wife, son, and unborn child's survival dependent on staying? It doesn't take much imagination the effect of unstable and explosive Shane thrown into the mix.  The situation is still tense and tittering on disaster which is of course compounded by zombies laying siege.  I am sure that even for those who are more about watching mindless whacking of zombies (eg Zombieland), if it wasn't for the survival of the characters, there would be no reason to watch the show.
In closing then, yes you will get more zombies later on but in the meantime, do have some patience to learn more about the characters; the wait will be worth it when real (I mean really real) crisis hit them on episode 12.",1331856000,5,2092,4.433420365535248
4817750,2,B005LAJ23A,"TWD started out very good, but has since become a show that revolves completely around 1 character-- Rick Grimes. Now I know this is based on the comics, but the problem for me is he isn't all that exciting or interesting. So if you happen to like anybody else, then don't bother with the show since they will eventually be killed-off. Rick's family is a bunch of bumbling idiots and the other characters are merely slaves beholden to what King Rick wants. The only other person to stand-up to Rick was Shane and he is dead now along with Dale. T-Dogg might as well be dead since he justs sits in the corner and says 1 sentence every 2-3 shows. Lori(Ricks wife) is a very unlikeable woman who thinks the world revolves around her. Their son Carl is a doofus who wanders around alone all the time creating mayhem for the rest. Andrea is the best female in the group(her sister was already killed-off), but she doesn't seem to fit in with the rest and has no connections to anyone else. Glenn is a somewhat amicable Asian dude, but the others treat him like crap and he is rather meek. Daryl is a redneck kinda guy with a crossbow who is a loner and survivalist type, but again given no personality since he must follow Rick's every wish like a beaten old dog. Carol -whose daughter Sophia is already dead- is totally useless, kinda like a lifeless prop on a stage. It's pretty funny that Rick constantly makes decisions for the whole group that have repeatedly gotten people killed by his poor decisions, yet the others blindly tag along much like the mindless zombies all around. And speaking of the zombies, they too are props, since this story is really about diferent surviving groups fighting it out--and not a zombie series per se. So in conclusion if you want a show that's really about 1 man(Rick) and his bumbling misadventures that slowly but surely get everyone else in the group killed-off, you'll enjoy TWD.",1331856000,8,1919,4.5813953488372094

4817755,5,B005LAJ23A,"I was beginning to worry that maybe this show was getting too far away from its source material, the 93 comic books, which are wonderful.  Like most tv shows or films, it cannot remain totally faithful to the source material but it is unwise to depart too far from something which worked so well in print.  I don't want to give anything away so let me say this: the comics are absolutely relentless on the death toll of living in this new world.  If the zombies don't kill you, your fellow survivors, or rival survivor clans, may do so. This episode picks up on that relentless death toll and marches us further ahead into the uncertain future for Rick and his son, Carl.  They are the two constant characters in the series as so many others fall in internal or external battles.

On a side note, Darryl (crossbow), was not in the original comics.  However, I have really grown to like him and hope he lasts as one of the characters.  I suspect his brother, the one who cut off his hand, is further along in the plot. This brother was also absent from the comics.  Darryl has to remain alive at least until we meet up with him again. I suspect the brother will be leading one of these rival clans.

I'm just not getting the same feeling from the show that had me rabidly waiting for the next episode last season. I have not read the comics that the show is based off of, but I truly hope the show is able to focus more on the apocalypse than the petty bickering that is getting old.

4817780,3,B005LAJ23A,"MAJOR SPOILERS A-PLENTY!!!!! so beware..

The writing on this show goes from interesting, deadly, to mediocre, soapy, interesting, and dumb-ass all within an entire episode. The first season did have me by the throat and would not let go; Fast, even pacing, great characters in a really messed-up universe, which has apparently gone from severely depressing to near-futile. There could be so many things to talk about, but there is laundry to do so...

Just a few things then..

 * Zombie effects/moments some of the best I have ever seen. The FX people are kicking-ass!

 * Glenn's character has been relegated to being more vulnerable (meek comes to mind, so does moronic- if they were going for laughs by sending him down that well..) in contrast to the 1st season, where the kid had some life and more smarts. My respect for his character has plummeted somewhat.

 * Carl. Man, he totally gets on my nerves. Wandering around free as a bird with that irritating giant hat on, crying one moment then doing something stupid the next.  I can understand the idea of his character growing up and reacting in that survival context, a young boy trying to prove himself, but... like other reviewers have mentioned, who keeps a leash on this kid in that kind of environment? Kids get up to shenanigans, but c'mon, this is ridiculous, which in turn makes Lori look like the Worst TV Mom. What is he, maybe eight or nine years old, and adults are handing him a large loaded gun. I might have forgotten the moment when he was trained, maybe?  The show becomes STAGY around Carl (and not just with him..), like he is a catalyst for events- the biggest one occurring this episode where he comes out of nowhere ( giant hat on, of course) almost obligatory with his new loaded gun. Geez..

 * I do feel sorry for some of the actors we never see anymore. Irone Singleton, you have my sympathy, pal.

 * Jeffrey DeMunn- you did a great job and brought some humanity to the table as Dale. You came off as real and one of the best.

 So long Shane- you were an interesting, angry, alpha-male character and had an overload of good screen-time moments- Hats off to Joe Bernthal for strong acting and good luck on his next show LA Noir, which involves Frank Darabont I believe.",1331596800,5,2257,4.5910224438902745

4817783,2,B005LAJ23A,"I really cannot believe what they have done to this show. It really seems like AMC and its set of unsophisticated, juvenile writers have their heart set on ruining this show by process of elimination of one important character at a time. Last week we saw Dale, a relatively major and regular cast member who provided an important dynamic to the group, be killed off in the most outlandish way (a zombie opening up his chest cavity with his bare hands, yeah right), and this week Shane, a principal cast member, was also booted off the show.

AMC should just cancel the show. They ruined it. Killing off Shane was an even more epic mistake than killing off Dale. Shows rarely recover from such major cast changes. Yes I know, in the comics, Shane dies pretty early on. But

1) the show has already deviated quite substantial from the comics anyway and
2) Shane was a regular cast member and the audience had established a connection to him. He was a major player. Killing off major characters like that is demoralizing.

So killing him this late on was a huge mistake and I don't think people realize how much his absence will be felt as the show continues. It will change everything.

Personally, I don't care much for following this past season 2. I might take a peek out of curiosity every now and then but this show is done for me. Shane was a central figure - controversial or not and the writers just turned his character into a caricature.

Word has it that Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale) left the show because AMC fired Darabont and he just didn't want anything to do with the show anymore and that Jon Bernthal (Shane) left for the same reason. In fact, Bernthal has been cast in Darabont's next TV project, ""L.A. Noir"". So it seems like the writers messed it up for everyone so badly by firing the head creative mind followed by lousy writing and the direction they took the show in general, that now half the cast are leaving voluntarily. Next week more will be killed off; personally I am betting on T-Dog, Hershel and Carol but it wouldnt surprise me if they offed Glenn too.

This show should have been about the adventure and this disease and trying to find answers as well as surviving, traversing the landscape marred by the apocalypse. Darabont set it up masterfully: dark, and sad and sinister. When Amy died and turned, the transformation was tragic and sad and it had resonance. They didn't even do that with Shane, it was just rushed and he turned almost instantly. It's like they couldn;t get it over with fast, to finish up in the time allotted.

The writers, after Darabont's departure, have degraded this show to soap opera level with lousy writing. Some drama and tragedy is good (like in season one) as it humanizes the show, but this show has become just that, a drama. Zombies and the zombie apocalypse have become the mere incidental backdrop.

Rick saw a helicopter in season one, but we don't know what happened and he never mentioned it again and no one ever asked again. If the world had come to an end and I saw a helicopter in the sky I would have hope that there is something left and ask questions and purse, instead of hanging out on little house on the prairie bickering with my best friend over some woman.

+ WHY IS THAT KID UNSUPERVISED? Over and over again, he just pops up in a scene. I mean since Lori gave Andrea a lecture on how to be a good doormat of a woman, she just got the award for the worst freaking mother EVER for letting her son wander around the zombie-overrun world unsupervised. Is this a joke?

+I liked how no one was phased about Dale's death. Maybe with the exception of Glenn, everyone just sort of went about their business like nothing of proportions happened. Andrea, from what I gather in the comics, was shattered at Dale, whom she was close to, dying but here she just had this dumb grin on her face like ""oh well, things happen"".

+ Very stealthy of both the readers and Shane to drag Rick into the open field to kill him.

+ This episode, much like the last and half a dozen before it, is not about zombies and end of the world. They are about two Alphas stuck in a ""how long is my ding dong"" contest and the entire show has been just about that; which contributed to the complete and utter destruction of Shane's character into nothing but a caricature and stereotype of the psycho Alpha.

Apparently the term Walking Dead refers to the living, not to the dead. In this episode it is somehow established, in the finest tradition of vague and incoherent story telling these writers are accustomed to,  that whatever that virus is that turns you, has apparently infected everyone, the living, so that now everyone turns, even if they were were not bit. If that is true, then why didn't we see that anywhere in the show (except for 2 episodes ago)? They spent the whole first season showing how people who get bit, and bit only, develop the symptoms such as getting a fever and dying. Not ONCE did they ever show an incidence that it was otherwise. We saw dead bodies on the highway that had not turned; now suddenly the dead turn without a bite. That doesn't make sense and it's called continuity or lack thereof.

The assumption is that the virus mutated and that this is what Jenner told Rick. But that also doesn't make sense. Why would Jenner withhold that info from everyone except for Rick. I mean why wouldnt he just tell  everyone that they are infected? He told them everything else; in fact, he had them under lock up and tried to convince them to die. This information would have served beautifully in that capacity. I mean, what's in it for him to lie anyway? That just doesnt makes sense and the only way it makes sense is that the writers are in fact just making this up as they go along - which evidently is what has been happening since they fired Darabont.

With regard to Shane: instead of keeping the differences in opinion between Rick and Shane to a manageable level and expanding on it, so as to keep the antagonism with regard to how to approach the post apocalypse, they turned this how into this stagy, melodramatic love triangle and Shane into American Psycho, ruining his character.

The thing is, Shane's character provided an important aspect and tension to the show. He was the guy who seemed headstrong, having gotten a little carried away given the totally desperate situation they are in (this is the zombie Apocalypse after all, we'd all lose it), but he was also strong and made sense and the audience was split, some agreed with him, some didn't, reflecting exactly the kinds of dilemmas these people were facing as a group: make an attempt to keep our humanity or stay strong and adhere to the no nonsense attitude Shane was advocating to survive. When Shane insisted they give up searching for the girl, audiences agreed. He was believable, he made sense. Remember Shane was shocked seeing Sophia come out of the barn, he consoled Carol after Sophia's demise, he did feel bad when he shot Otis to get away. He had humanity, which they stripped off him for no good reason. And instead of continuing to keep his character complicated like that, they went overboard and turned him into a psycho who was about to murder his childhood and best friend over a stupid woman. Huge fail.

There is such a thing called consistency within a plot dear AMC writers. You cant just make characters, in a span of 10 days, act out of character like that and make a 180 degree turn. Shane's character was not a sociopath. He had rough edges but he had compassion too.

I am gravely disappointed with how this show has turned out. AMC should continue on its path of crappy cheapness, as they did with this show by keeping the cast on the same place for the whole season and firing the creative head talent, and just cancel the show.

There is a lot of serious narrative fail in not only this episode but throughout the second season and I think people are starting to feel the void of Frank Darabont and his masterful storytelling. The network and the crappy, cheap writing has literally driven away most of the actors.",1331596800,17,8102,4.524265208475735
4817784,4,B005LAJ23A,"""Better Angels"" is episode 12 in the second season of ""The Walking Dead"".

Some thoughts...

1.) a seemingly 'slow' episode ends with an absolute blockbuster of an ending.

2.) one gets the feeling that the normal way of being infected with the Zombie 'virus' as just undergone a new and sinister mutation.

3.) my only concern for this show/series is that there seems to be a definitive 'soap opera' quality creeping into the events that involve our survivors. Things seem to be becoming a little more bizarre every week. This may not be necessarily a good sign.

4.) great actors and great acting giving us memorable characters.

Conclusion:
Overall a rather slow episode (2 1/2 to 3 Stars), but with a stunning finale (5+ Stars)

Aggregate rating 4 1/2 Stars.

4817786,5,B005LAJ23A,"Finally I think we are seeing what Dr. Jenner was telling Rick back at the CDC. The virus has now mutated into a non-blood borne pathogen. This has nothing to do with the weapon being used with some sort of residual residue on it like when Rick is forced to stab Shane. If you remember, Shane broke the neck of the captured gunman, and he turned into a walker also, without any bites or scratches, just like at the public works facility and the two security guards. The look that Rick gave when he saw the two security guards reflected a look of ""of course...I knew that"".. He also gave the same look when confronted with seeing Shane become a walker as well. This is telling that perhaps the virus has now become an airborne virus, and no longer requires blood contact, like the avian and swine flu virus became. If this is the case, then the risk is even higher now. Anyone who came close to a walker and had them breathe into their face may now become a walker. At the public works facility, Rick had three walkers on top of him breathing into his face also. It will be interesting to see what happens next.

The captured gunman told Shane that the camp he came from was 5 miles up the road. With all of the shooting going on around the farm, the people at that camp have to know that somewhere in the vicinity of this farm there are other people. This is going to bring the group of thirty to the farm for a huge showdown soon. Being in the Army for over 25 years, I can tell you that 5 miles is nothing when it comes to hearing a gunshot, especially alot of them. I would not put it past the director of the walking dead to have the group of thirty's leader none other than Merle, Darryl's brother.

So, we have three threats now... The group of walkers coming across the field to the farm, The group of thirty, and the possible airborne virus confronting them. Everyone is at risk. So, this leads me to a very, very disturbing subject...

Will Lori have her child as the first hybrid walker? Will the possible airborne threat enter through her bloodstream and create a baby who has already been infected as a walker? How is that for a WTF for you?",1331510400,33,2153,4.298029556650246

4817832,2,B005LAJ23A,"Well, I have to say that these last 2 episodes of TWD have been full of major surprises --and sad farewells. The episode itself finally brings the simmering hostility between Rick and Shane to a close. While people have said Shane had to die to stay true to the comics, I feel they could have deviated from this and created situations whereby he has left the group, but not been killed-off. Both actors who played Dale and Shane were excellent and gave the show a great balance/excitement with their characters. Out of the remaining group, only Rick and Daryl seem to have leadership potential--and add excitement to the show. But Daryl is not the leader type and more of a loner. T-Dog has been inactive the whole season, and Glenn is quite frankly too meek of a character and this is not helped by the actor who plays him. All of Herschels group are kinda useless, and Lori is an idiot. Andrea also adds little, but she is better than Lori. Unless the core group adds some super-interesting members(and great actors), I feel that TWD may run -out of steam in the not-so-distant future. I don't think you can kill off main players portrayed by excellent actors and expect you can just plug in another person to fit the bill. TWD could have killed-off some of the lesser characters and been fine with a replacement... instead they did the opposite. I still like the show, but can't say I like the way it's going. Season 1 was better than 2, and 3 may be the worst. Time will tell.",1331510400,3,1480,4.5055762081784385

4817835,5,B005LAJ23A,"I read the first 12 issues of Robert Kirkman's epic graphic novel The Walking Dead back in 2006. Late fans to the story can now pick up the first 48 issues of the graphic novel in a convenient single work titled&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Walking-Dead-Compendium-One/dp/1607060760/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Walking Dead:  Compendium One</a>. As of today, Kirkman has published almost 100 issues in the series (that I now anxiously check my mailbox for every month).

What's all that mean? It means that there are years and years of TV seasons ahead if AMC stays the course of excellence that it has so far done in the first two seasons. Why? Because as far as the graphic novel issue-by-issue storyline parallel to the TV series goes, I would guesstimate that the TV series is MAYBE through only about the first dozen issues.

Has the TV series taken some liberties and made changes to the story(ies) presented in the graphic novel? Sure. But are those liberties just as well told as Kirkman originally laid out? So far so good. Actually, so far: excellent! Kirkman's oversight has brought The Dead to life in this surprisingly fabulous adaptation of the graphic novel series. Why surprisingly? Because it is a rare occasion that a film or TV adaptation is as good as and so true to the source material. This is one of the best shows on TV.

The Walking Dead continues the story of (former) Police Officer Rick Grimes and his band of normal-world-refugees across a world suddenly infected by a Walking Dead sickness. Civilization has been replaced by vicious hordes of the undead. But at its core, the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. There's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead series combined with believable scenarios.

Rest assured, there is no lack of unfathomable chaos and horror in Season 2 of The Walking Dead...although like I said...not just because of the zombies, but mainly as a result of human survivors in desperate situations that must do the unthinkable to stay alive. Fans of the graphic novel will be screaming for Season 3 because of Season 2's final episode cliffhanger glimpse of a certain person and place to come.

The Walking Dead is a compelling, thought provoking drama. And if you can't wait until the next season, the good news is you can cheat and start reading the graphic novels if you want to get ahead.

Check it out.",1331510400,146,2557,5.030732860520095

With that said, I feel that we have all been waiting for this episode to happen. I don't want to put spoiler's in here so I'll just say I can't wait to see how it plays out. I want to see how the rest of the group reacts to what everyone who has seen the show now knows. (On a side note, I took away a star for a campy b-movie horror flick effect they used close to the end.

Dale walked around with a floppy hat and didn't have to make the hard decisions and sacrifices like Shane, Rick, Andrea, and the rest of them. What Dale didn't realize is that little jerk is not a 'kid' he looks well into his late 20's and his posse of 30 men or so would end up raping the women and children and burning the whole farm down. Dale is delusional and a self-appointed self important philosopher with nothing to back it up. The world has NEVER been civilized.  Remember Genghis Khan? Stalin? Pol Pot? Woodrow Wilson? I can go on and on...The world has always been dependent on individuals who take risk and sacrifice their lives so people like Dale have the luxury to grown old and fat and sit around judging. So he's gone like most marxist marie antoinettes...their delusions of utopia always ends up in a gulag in cambodia or a gulag under Stalin or in a FEMA camp. I like the series and zombies are not that far fetch of an idea...just look at the zombies in the UN and the House and Senate sucking the life and liberty out of individuals everywhere.  Look at the zombies in the UN that surpass the Congress and throw our troops into 'conflicts' Never declared wars!  Anyway, it's a tv show and it is interesting.

Read the comic book if you want a fast, action-packed zombie killer. Watch the TV series if you want a deeper connection with the characters.

Season two is boring and I'm sick to death of the love triangle stuff. I feel like I'm watching a Lifetime Channel movie. Maybe the writers don't get it, but i see this as mostly a series for guys.

He is an amazing actor and can't wait for them to develop him even more in the show! I know it has that soap opera feel but that helps to make it seem real. The show is not all zombies walking around everywhere all the time and that helps to draw you into the ""family"" feel of the show (as in this group is a family of sorts). I do not want them to make Carl into a bad kid though, they need some sense of normalcy and he can bring it eventually.
I would like to see more of the fall of Atlanta and even more about what the Dr told Rick at the end of season 1, maybe take an excursion to the greater Atlanta area to get supplies or something. Maybe even another group of people like this group in another area, and develop the show where they meet up. Could be interesting. Open some kind of door that can bring others into this show, other people would surely try to settle down in surrounding farms? Maybe even some neighbors that Hershell and Maggie know.

After sitting through half of the episodes so far i find myself laughing, crying and gesticulating at the TV but NOT in a way that's good. Why? The characters are terrible. You would think with all the time they spend talking to each other in forced dialogues they would be more interesting but you care about them less and less.

The story doesn't move anywhere. Plot lines  get dragged out for episodes when they could be settled much quicker. Characters behave in haphazard, nonsensical ways. This of course leads to, you guessed it - more pointless ridiculous dialogue.

The world they live in makes no sense? why is the Farm so safe..there's never been any exploration of the zombies or what they are or do except that they grunt and snarl and pop up here and there . If they roam about the vicinity of the farm why does everyone walk around like there is no danger? There's no sense that they live in a world that has changed or any interest on their part in understanding it. The zombies just exist in the background.

This show has been 'Wrong' since the first episode of Season 2 and since nothing really happens its incorrect to say that it's spiraling downhill - it's kind of like a zombie itself lurching around, reeking and dead for a while.",1331078400,4,1313,4.527426160337553

4818002,5,B005LAJ23A,"The story line is getting more interesting now. Honestly, season two was so boring I wanted to beat my head on the table.

Now we are actually getting to the meat and potatoes of how this situation at the farm is playing out in the long run. Rick was correct in his assessment at first regarding the injured gunman. He did the right thing by saving him, and letting him have a chance. However, the moment that the gunman mentioned that he went to school with Maggie was the moment he should have been shot. The gunman would have eventually led his group back to the farm where Maggie lived. At this point, Rick had no idea how many men were in the other group. With that being said though, if Rick hadn't hesitated, Shane and Rick would have never gotten into the brawl which brought them closer as buddies again.

At the public works, there was a situation with the two security guards in how they actually became walkers. The look on Rick's face as he was viewing them on the ground reflected to me that it was something he knew, and was just seeing for the first time. (Could this be what Doctor Jenner at the CDC whispered to him before the escape?) Could the virus that causes the walkers be turning from a blood borne to an airborne threat now? Many diseases mutate in such ways...

Also, while I am on the topic of what Dr. Jenner told Rick, remember that there were blood tests that the Doctor did on all personnel coming into the CDC when he allowed them in for safety reasons. Did Doctor Jenner also tell Rick that his wife was pregnant at that time? There wouldn't have been time for her to show that quickly on a test, which will reflect that Shane actually is the father of the baby.

The thirty men in the gunman's group apparently have no remorse, and are cold hearted people (The gunman's admission to Darryl about the rape of the two teenage girls in front of her father at the campsite is telling of the morals of his group).  I do believe however, that this plot will transpire and reveal that the leader of the thirty men is no other than Darryl's brother Merle. Remember in season one, Merle cut off his own hand to get off of the rooftop after being handcuffed to a pipe by Rick. There is going to be obvious ramifications to Rick and his group if this is the case. Also, if Merle is the leader of the group, what loyalty will Darryl show? Will he be loyal to his own brother and betray the others? Or, will he finally be turned enough to be a good person to see Merle for what he is, and ultimately save the farm by killing his brother? If I were the writer, I would place this into the plot. It only makes sense. This farm is not too far from Atlanta where Merle was left...

The farm itself is a small oasis in the middle of hell. There seem to be more and more walkers that are coming from seemingly no where now. Are these the walkers that were walking the road in a herd in season two on the highway, and have now scattered? There were alot of vehicles on that road, which would have a potential to have hundreds of walkers in the area. With the shooting going on at the farm, I don't know if that is drawing them back in now or not.

I have noticed that there is no more communication attempts by Rick to the man and boy who saved him in season one. I am not sure if that is going to play out later or not. Is this man and boy in the group of thirty? It would be interesting to see them re-united again.

Carol and Darryl seem to be getting closer together. This could provide stability for him, and keep him from leaving the group regardless of how he feels about many of the others.

Shane just needs to finally accept that Lori is not going to be interested in him anymore. I do not know if the car crash perhaps has made her miscarry somehow though. What would be worse as a plot than to have Shane realize the baby was his, and that god forbid a walker hears the baby cry and kills it? That would prove that Shane could not keep his own child safe, and disprove all of his comments about Rick after all. It is a bad scene, but shock value is what the show is all about. I haven't seen any infants as zombies yet. That would really be disturbing to witness.

I feel if they really wanted to they could film different scenes giving us more in depth insight to the other characters and how they feel at times.  I barely even know anything about the black guy?  I mean he's the only black guy in the group and I was hoping he would have some cool attributes to bring to the group but they have him as a prop practically?  Seriously?  Ever since the farm, Daryl seems a little here and there and not included as much.  I think that guy is so interesting to watch, yet they are filming some retarded girl in a bed getting five star treatment because she can't take the pressure.

Lori talks about the nights getting colder indicating winter is approaching and you would assume they would be trying to gather supplies or ensure they can make it through the winter but so far this entire idea of surviving seems to take a seat while they debate this guys fate because they can't figure out what the hell they want to do with him.  I get the whole concept of feeling the pressure of deciding his fate but my God do we need to drag out the entire episode over it?  Should of been less than 1/4 episode discussing this guys fate.

The point im trying to make here is there is TONS of stuff they can pack into an episode.  If they want to drag the cast staying on the farm for so long at least have them explore, gather, go on missions anything to where we don't have to watch a Post Apocalyptic U.S Congress argueing over a bill for a month.

The story overall from an entertainment perspective wasn't to bad for me. The living and the dead were at it again and finally they are starting to use hand weapons instead of firearms. The part where daryl (Norman Reedus) knifes the zombie in the head was quite classic. And then Carl just about pooing his pants when was the zombie got partially free was just great. For that part, I was wondering whether Carl was going to kill the zombie or not. In fact, I was wondering the whole time if Carl was going to kill the prisoner. Something to think about.

A couple of things:

1. The whole story itself needs to pick up the pace. The writers are spending to much time being a soap opera, even though zombies are involved. There is so much more then a simple farmhouse compared to the rest of world around them. I do understand though that leaving the farmhouse could be quite hard especially with all of the supplies that are needed are readily available.

2. I have found Dale to be quite annoying. It's like he's trying to live in a dream world or something where everything needs to be fair. Wake up dude! Zombies have taken over the world, people who were once those nice neighbors of yours are no longer nice. It is survival of the fittest. The weak die and the strong live. Shane had it right when he was theorizing about letting the prisoner loose. Rule of law is out the window and civilization is pretty much kaput or least can't be restarted until a few billion pesky zombies are taken care of first.

3. If the group finds putting this kid to death hard, wait until you have issues of starvation, cannibalism, rapists, murderers, etc, other groups, zombie herds, and oh, the governor. How do you deal w/ those situations? On top of that, how much can AMC really show on TV? Do you think the writers can push the limits of what is acceptable and go as far as what the movies ""The Road"" did with Viggo Mortesen or ""The Book of Eli"" with Denzel Washington did since these are different yet similar situation?

It will be interesting to see how the writers pull this off. All of the characters need to be challenged a bit more then what has happened so far. Overall, I am anxious for the next episode.",1330905600,2,2230,4.413625304136253

4818128,3,B005LAJ23A,"*spoilers*

Poor Dale, he was such a humanitarian; a real Mensch and likable character. I think the group really took him for granted and killing off his character was an epic fail on part of the writers as he was not only a likable character but also represented a balancing force in the dynamic of the group. Now they are left with the trigger happy hanging judges that run the group and it's going to be hard to water down the intensity of their polar opposite points of view. And if rumors of serious cast changes are true, more deaths are to come as we approach the season finale.

I noticed that in this show most of the characters are beginning to behave in a way designed to service a desired plot outcome (like Carl attracting the Walker to get Dale killed) instead of the plot responding to the characters. For example, Lori and Rick must be just about the dumbest parents ever. Who lets their kid (that was just recently shot), wander around unsupervised in a world run over by the flesh eating undead? ESPECIALLY after what happened to Sophia. I mean that stupid kid was wandering the woods, climbing into the barn with Randall yelling ""I am a man, I can take care of myself"", was almost eaten by a Walker and not once did his dumb parents wonder where he is. That is not very believable and was obviously put in there to service the desired plot outcome.

And then that kid Randall: they all act like there was NO alternative to execution, just so the writers can put the characters in a situation where they have to contemplate his execution. But there were other options besides murdering the kid and the writers DIDN'T do a good job at showing us that they really had exhausted all those and had to now consider execution for lack of a better alternative. It wasn't believable and again, put in there to service the desired plot outcome.

The logically incoherent rules and reversals of elements according to whether they need them in an episode is also annoying. The Walker that attacks Carl is not strong enough to pull his feet out of the mud and is barely able to wrap its paws around him, but just a few hours later tears a man's chest cavity open with his bare hands? I didn't think that was even possible. A wild animal with claws needs to put more work in that but in this case the Walker just went through Dale like a hot knife through butter. And where did that stealth zombie come from anyway? One moment we see Dale walk in an open field with no one is sight for miles, next minute a clumsy Walker is standing behind him.

Hershel goes from ""No guns and violence on my farm"" to ""meh, kill whoever you want, I don't care"". And for Rick, the decisive reason not to cold-bloodedly murder someone is not what Dale said, but that his kid is watching, whom he just five minutes ago asked to never ask any questions or disagree with anyone, no matter what. Are they kidding me? The dialogue in this dhow must have been written by juvenile boys. It is conpletely devoid of any kind of substance, wit and insight. The writers have gone from quoting William Faulkner in season 1 to Lori giving Andrea a hard time for not being a good submissive woman who knits and does laundry for the big strong men and Rick telling his kid, whom he never even asked what he actually said to Carol, to just summarily shut up and never ever ask any questions or question anyone. Great values to instill on your kid. This show should seriously be the called A/-holes on the Zombie Farm, because that is what most of the characters are.

It is also insulting that T-Dog, who did have somewhat of an interesting role in season 1 (and even beginning season 2) and actually had meaningful conversations with other people, barely ever appears anymore and when he does, he is standing in the corner quietly. I think his ""what do we do with the body"" single line was the most he has said since episode 3 of this season, which just points to the overall crappy cheapness of this show (dont have to pay actors that don't talk much or are seen, same location...). T-Dog's role in the show and group has been reduced to that of doing the grunt work. Sure, let the token black guy take orders from king Rick and queen bee Lori. What's gonna be next? let him be eaten by zombies?

They should bring the focus back on the apocalypse and what caused it and survival and leave the farm and they should use zombies as another character in the show - as Jenner did - instead of as just props that pop up every now and then so that the producers and writers can check it off their list of things to do. Didn't Rick see a helicopter when he was in Atlanta? Whatever happened ot that? Seriously, it seems like the writers are making this up as they go.

The previews are unfortunately showing that we are going to go back to that Rick/Lori/Shane triangle and I just don't care about these peoples' personal issues. No one does. The world has come to end, get over yourselves and your petty affairs you selfish dolts. Why couldn't they have gotten rid of Lori? Everyone's problem would be solved if Lori was gone, because let's face it, as the Alpha, Rick is acting like the judge, jury and executioner to prove to the other Alpha, Shane, that he can take care of the water hole and his mate.

I hear something about the comic's nemesis The Governor making his way through season 3. So then it will be this group vs. the Governor's gang. Like Boys in the Hood but in a zombie setting. Yawwwn. Been there, done that. Not very original.

And hey, if you run into a group that looks like they wanna hurt you, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. No reason to waste 22 episodes on it and artificially build the story around it.  It is not like there is only one patch of land left for all of humanity and these people had to fight for it. Again, the writers are artificially extending these peoples' struggles by creating directions and ""issues"" that don't make sense. this isn't south central LA. You don't like, move on.

As to Dale, story wise, maybe it is better he died. He wasn't going to make it in this world. He pretty much lost out on the execution debate as no one had his back and thought he was some naive and delusional old guy. And he said that he didn't want to live in this kind of a world anymore. So his demise, while tragic, was his peace.

If they do that with too many characters, though, I suspect alienation by fans. People are drawn to not only the story but also characters and historically shows that have gotten rid of major characters ended up alienating the fan base, eventually facing cancellation.

Love how you guys teased us with Lori flinching like she might come through for Dale and support him.  RIP Dale, but you didn't know the law.  The kid must die.  He shot at another human being.  He counseled with felons.  The fact that he shot and/or was with those other criminal elements when they committed murder is enough to support the death penalty.  Andrea should have mentioned that small little trivia when Dale was crying like an ACLU baby.  If I were Shane I would try and get someone to come along with me to reconnoiter that other group.

Don't complain too much or they will cancel the show altogether and replace it with something that won't even have a good first season. Yes, it would be lovely if they would continue to follow the example set by the first season, but it is still a really good show. Very few television shows or movies ever manage to make such a laughed at topic (zombies) good and this show went way beyond good. The Walking Dead brings a real-life twist on to the zombie flick and it's original.

Yes, the second season is slower than the first, and of course there are going to be things done that a person would never do in real life, but that's how they make the characters' lives less about laundry and cooking and sitting around waiting and more about the things that make good television - action and adventure. I would honestly prefer a few more unrealistic plot turns to make things more interesting. But the show is still highly interesting- you just have to wait a little more for the parts that make you watch and won't let you go.

Ladies, where's my clean laundry and ice tea? Let's ignore our kid and NOT keep tabs on him, as it worked so well for Sophia.

Even without the zombie outbreak, most of us keep tabs on our children. I would think it would be even more important with a zombie outbreak. Of course Sophia's mother was allowing her husband to beat her and molest her child(Season 1) so maybe nothing changes when the world ends.

Good to know there is still a show that shows women and minorities know their place. Somebody get Rush Limbo on the phone and tell him ""sponsors ponsors, who needs 'em."" Since anime writers appear to involved, I can only tell you underage girls with really short skirts are next.

4818209,1,B005LAJ23A,"I really hate the direction this show has taken regarding everything. I am also seriously annoyed at the gross gender stereotypes employed by the writers. This whole episode clearly separated the women and men, with the men going ""outside"" and handling it like real men, out on the open, fighting each other over their property (Lori), while the little women stay back on the farm and work the kitchen and have conversations, trying to talk and caress each other out of suicide and other feminine issues, given the sensitive and delicate souls they are.

There is not one interesting or strong woman in the show and everytime someone does try to be, they are immediately shot down by the writers as incompetent bches who need to be put back in their proper place and predetermined gender roles.

I also love how any woman allowed to make her own choice on this show IMMEDIATELY regrets it, reaffirming the backwards, sexist notions of these equally backwards writers that women really don't know better and truly need a man to make it for them.

Andrea wants a gun to shoot and when she is finally given one, she accidentally shoots Daryl (to make the point that woman are incompetent as in ""we told you so"") and then gets her gun privileges immediately revoked by the men in charge. Dale never had gun training before, but he gets to automatically have one while Andrea has to earn the privilege to own a gun.

Lori had a choice to swallow those pills and abort the baby, but she threw them up right after she took them and then Rick shamed her for trying to make that choice.

Between the kitchen scene and Rick and Shane fighting over who ""owns"" Lori, I was in constant rage. Like women were property to be owned. Between Carol and Lori, I am not sure who is the bigger doormat. Lori's entire conversation in the last episode in the tent was about making sure Rick understands that he owns her instead of Shane. ""Shane thinks he owns us, but honey, that is not true because YOU own us so set him straight."" Urgh.

And in this episode Andrea is made to look like an ahole and has Lori yell at her for possessing insufficient skills to be dude property. Of course we are supposed to identify with Lori and take her side, as she has been portrayed throughout the show as the reasonable one  - since she knows her place - and Andrea has always been portrayed as the screw-up, the messed up rebel, so she couldn;t possible be right. And what, Andrea calls her queen bee? Who wrote this episode? Mr. Roper?

The scene with Lori and Andrea is just indicative of the so many problems this show has with portraying women. It was disappointing to see them have that ""working mom"" vs ""stay at home mom"" conversation, like do we really need to go there now, I mean the world has come to an end.

With every episode this show has managed to reach new and embarrassing heights with respect to pretty much everything: story, plausibility, character development...Also, nothing ever really happens. At the end of every episode, we're basically back to where the episode began. They leave the farm, the come back. They go into town, they come back. Lori's car crashes, but she is back at the end of the 45 minutes. Shane and Rick have an intesne talk and beat each other, their lives in danger yet they come back. People get sick or shot but they get better. Someone wants to commit suicide, but doesn't and everything is fine at the end of the 45 minutes. It is like those situational sitcoms where something happens and then the entire episode is about resolving that particular issue and at the end of the half hour we are back to point A as the issue has bene solved. There is just nooooo forward momentum! It is the same routine everytime. I can understand why people call this comatosely slow and that it feels like it is not going anywhere.

And whats up with that whole ""you can get it through scratching"" thing? Someone bathes in zombie blood at least every third episode or has zombie blood splattered all over their open wounds or into their mouths, but they suddenly decide that scratches make you sick? Where did that come from?

I will finish this season but as someone said, I really can't abide the Post-Zombie Apocalypse World As Run By Stupid White Men any longer.

The first season successfully captured the feel of a global apocalypse. The first half of the second season had a reasonable number of roller-coaster peaks and valleys, capped off by the Barnyard Massacre. The second half, sorry to say, is falling a little short for me. There's a little too much storytelling through dialog, the interior sequences are for the most part kinda boring, and zombies seem more like a nuisance than a global threat.

There is clearly a cut in the production budget. It shows. AMC used to be the go-to network for quality original series. They're on the verge of losing that, and it's the fault of the network bean counters who think viewers are too stupid to notice the corner-cutting.",1330473600,,837,4.6938775510204085

Shane shouldn't have lived, Rick is being too nice to everyone. He slept with his wife, tried to make the rules, and he tried to be the father of Carl. Why would you still want to be friends with him? He's done too much already. Breaking the lock on the barn was intense, finding Sophia was the only good that came out of it. I also think they should keep Shaun alive, the only thing he did wrong was sticking up for the last group he was in. Rick saved him, it would be a waste of time just to kill him now.

I know it is based on a comic book but I have never seen it and couldn't care less if it follows it or not. I think the writing is excellent and if they did fire the original writers the new ones are doing a fine job.

I agree with others that at some point they should move on from the farm house to keep things interesting and unpredictable BUT...
If I were in that same situation I would be in no hurry to leave the farm house. You have fresh water, a renewable food supply, and relatively few zombies. And when they do occaisionally stumble out of the woods you can see them coming from a mile away since they have to cross an open field to get to the house. I think the only way it would make any sense to leave is if something drastic happened like the house burning down. Even then, the location is still ideal and I think I would either rebuild it or go scavange for more RVs or even find a truck and drag some abandoned mobile homes onto the site. In any case I think the writers need to give them a very compelling reason to leave or it won't make sense.

I think Rick is without question the type of person I would want as the leader of the group over someone like Shane. Rick has proven that he can kick A$$ when he needs to (both in this and the previous episode) yet he knows how to be a diplomat when the situation calls for it. Granted there is no room for diplomacy when it comes to the Walkers but there are other groups of survivors out there and the answer will not always be ""Kill 'em all, let God sort it out."" but that is the only answer Shane knows. Before the apocolypse they were both cops. Would you rather be pulled over by Rick or Shane? That said, someone like Shane can be very valuable to the group, just not as the leader. I think in this episode Rick did what he needed to do to reestablish himself as the Alpha Male of the group.

Shows like this are very expensive to make and unfortunately have a limited audience. There are just a lot of people who you will never convince to watch just because there are ""Zombies"" in it. I know. I tried. No matter how good the writing and acting is. The same goes for shows about space smugglers with an old west theme, or robots from the future, etc. I love these types of shows. If you are reading this then you probably love these types of shows too, but we are a minority. It is understandable then that the budget for a show like this has to be limited if it is to turn a profit at all. No profit, no show. That's just plain old economics. Legal dramas for example are cheaper to produce and have a potential for a much larger audience. I like those too when they are well done. I recently checked out The Firm 2012 on HULU and liked it.
So I am ok with a few compromises if it keeps the show in production. You want an episode with more zombies? Fine. Some of the supporting cast will have to sit out. You want an episode with a lot of involvement from the supporting cast? Ok. We'll have to cut way back on the zombies.
I am ok with this give and take to keep a great show going. Maybe for the season finale you say ""To hell with the budget! Bring on the zombies and hand Dale a shotgun!""

I love this show and am very much looking forward to the rest of this season and beyond. I highly recomend it to anyone looking for some solid entertainment.",1330300800,4,3495,4.097810218978102

Jesus Christ, it's one thing to try to save everyone and their cat but when it comes between you and a man who wants you dead so that he can replace you then what is the issue here? Where is the angst in making this decision? I don't care if it's your best friend from the 3rd grade. There are lines in life you don't let anyone cross post-apocolypse or not. Also, I don't think that the resolution of this conflict between Shane and Rick and Carol and Andrea is the big ticket item for this season. Don't get me wrong I think that this is going to happen, but I think the big surprise is going to be when Rick reveals what the doctor told him at the end of season 1. It probably has something to do with the two cop corpses they found that weren't bitten. So why don't they get on with it already and quit playing around.

My issue is currently the static nature of some of the ""dark side"" members of the cast - we continue to see them make bad decisions (this episode really highlights that) yet the group keeps them around, with little more than a slap on the wrist. I hope that either they begin to change their nature and grow, or the group sees the true hazard that they represent and removes them.",1330300800,,621,4.544642857142857

4818282,2,B005LAJ23A,"I hope people realize that there are only three more episodes left on the second season and that it has all pretty much taken place on the Farm of Their Discontent and been about Rick, Shane and Lori. That's pretty bad. I have said this several times with my reviews and I think it is finally dawning on people that this show really is no longer what it started out to be. Gone are the excitement, urgency and somber mood of the first season. Gone is the terrifying setting, the struggle to survive, to find answers, to dig deeper into questions about the human soul and the consequences of days gone by in the zombie apocalypse. I am all for character development but the characters in this show have all been facing a slow death, just as the show itself. T-Dog, Daryl, Dale, Carol and Glenn don't even appear on this episode anymore (that is half the principal cast) which I think is symbolic, more than anything else, as these characters have pretty much stopped mattering a long time ago vis a vis the petty, Lifetime Television for Women problems of the other three. The show has become all about Rick, Shane and Lori and that stagy, soapy love triangle between them.

Rick and Shane - in a scene that reeked of Old Spice and ba/l+ls - pull over on a deserted road 18 miles out (why 18?) where they get to - in a very tes/tosterone loaded way no less - man it up and talk about their feelings over Lori; Lori - an unlikable, selfish and moronic character with no redeeming qualities and someone who has been the cause and source of a lot of misery and grief for a lot of people in this group - especially between Rick and Shane who are willing to kill each other over her. KILL EACH OTHER. In fact, watching these two beat the living hell out of each other 18 miles outside of the farm in some random location ravaged by the APOCALYPSE, as in END OF THE WORLD, over a woman, made me seriously question whether they both still deserve to live. These people are so short sighted and idiotic, they all just deserve to be gutted already and put out of their misery.

Back at the good old homestead, where women know their place in the kitchen, Lori and Andrea have a profound conversation; the kind of conversation miso/gynist men imagine women should have with one another in an ideal world, which for the writers of this show is the post apocalypse. That entire conversation Lori and Andrea had in the kitchen was cringe worthy and insulting. My god it was like two 8th graders had written that lame, ineffective dialogue. It had no power and did not make any point or evoke any kind of intelligent thought. In fact, it made Andrea look bad, which is ridiculous. I couldn't believe Lori, as a woman of the 21st century, was giving Andrea a hard time for not sticking around the house washing clothes and cooking. And I couldn't believe that the writers had seriously nothing better to write about than reciting outdated, Victorian notions about how as a woman Andrea should basically know her place and let the big, strong MEN take care of the important stuff while she devotes her time to knitting and making a comfortable home for said protectors. Really? I mean no...REALLY? R.E.A.L.L.Y??

It also seems like they are artificially extending the whole ""Shane is the villain"" story arc to make up for a lack of direction and originality.

Firing Darabont was a huge mistake. A Hollywood Reporter article was talking about huge budget cuts imposed on the show and how the network repeatedly dumped all over Darabont's creative vision by imposing things like 50% of the shots occurring outdoors and 50% indoors (indoors being cheaper to film) and another note asked whether or not the audience had to always see the zombies - couldn't they simply hear them sometimes. It's been said that Darabont was involved in constant battles with the network to maintain the creative vision that drew so many fans to the series in the first place and that those fights eventually led to him being fired altogether.

Cast members, who were not happy by Darabont's departure, and especially outraged at the network's calculated move to fire him right after Comic-con, were also reportedly harassed and warned about making any public comments on this. Afraid to be killed off and also pink slipped, they all obliged.

All this would explain why the entire season has taken place on one farm instead of them moving and why there have been a minimal number of new characters - all of which would have greatly contributed to the quality of the show. This season just gives the whole show a bad name, which is a shame because Darabont did an amazing job introducing us into the zombie apocalypse and these characters who were all multidimensional when their journey began.",1330300800,43,4755,4.621301775147929

4818284,2,B005LAJ23A,"Ok, I must write this because I have find myself rather turned off from the show.  I will say I am a fan of the comics but surprisingly I have no problem with the show not showing a blood bath every 5 seconds like the comics.  What does bother me the most about the show is what the show likes to advertise itself on ""its all about the characters.""  I feel that if they want to truly show this side like they did in the comics then they should not reuse already discussed problems.  I am bored of Andrea already.  She is predictable and her character has little or no significance anymore except to be someone to hate.  The reuse of the suicide issue I feel did not need to be brought up again.  Could we have not focused on immediate issues such as supplies, defense, finding information.  What do the other characters do (missing TDog) when they are not involved with baby issues, psycho Shane or crying Carol?  I feel that instead of stretching and elongating 3 central issues for 5 episodes.  They should have several issues that need to be solved.  Too be honest, they are only stalling the inevitable with Shane and Andrea.  Prolonging the solution to a very dramatic and horrific outcome ruins the shock or the luster of the solution to a conflict.  It does not help to build tension and therefore lessons the resolution.

I also feel that this show needs to a radical change of pace.  More characters would be nice.  Hey new characters will bring more interesting problems.  Or the show can expand on the other characters and their (hopefully and refreshing unselfish) problems.  Finally, have them investigate, explore, scavenge the world around them.  This show can be more that 45 minutes of repetitiveness and then 15 minutes of action.  Don't give me more zombie fights, that is action without a purpose.  It does not help build the plot.

I hope it improves but as this episode ended, I slowly became frustrated with the same issues being carried over and over again.  As it begins to stretch your characters look unintelligent and rather unimaginable.  Conflict resolution can save this series but I feel it should not be the finale that resolves everything.  Conflict resolution should be throughout the entire season and the finale should start more conflicts.

These are my thoughts.  Thank you reading.  I hope for those who enjoy do not over react.",1330300800,16,2368,4.682038834951456

Shane, Andrea and Glenn are the only intelligent people in the entire series. At least their willing to do what it takes to survive.

You can't throw in a few extra zombies and call it excitement. It's not!!! At this point, I hope they all get eaten, including the writers. These people couldn't even survive a big inner city neighborhood (the ghetto), nevertheless a zombie apocalypse. Kill 'em all then cancel the show.

The zombies are more or less part of the back ground, they are the set to this crazy apocalypse world.

4818360,4,B005LAJ23A,"The episode ""trigger-finger"" is just the quick-fix were all waiting for but, is it matching up to the relentless high standards of the book counter-part? Maybe so. Maybe not, yet. I just hope the TV series makes it to season 6 at this rate and by season 3 with the characters and back-story out of the way we might get a show worth watching. Trigger-finger is a suspenseful short turning point, the pace it went was far quicker than that of previous episodes, with it focused more toward action than drama. It even answers far less questions and leaves even more. So there is that. I give it 4/5 stars, if it slowed up a small notch, packed in with a bit more content It'd be a 5/5.

What I think of the Tv series The Walking Dead is it needs still this; (if your a Walking Dead cast-member you should read it, maybe you agree)

-Survival Mindset: Less worried about where you are, more about whats currently happening. That usually equals superb suspense, engaging conflicts, & a sense of reality.

-Characters: Should have redeeming qualities like being engaging, thrilling, tactful, practical, ect. or even witty in the ""heat of the moment"". Basically, they work best under pressure. This is something they may not be even aware of yet or ever.

-Writing, can't stress this enough, they need to have a better written script in-order to immerse to the audience, with a sense of surreal awareness with the cast & characters. Write it to fit the theme(zombies/survival/mystery, yes in that order mostly), then the setting(place/area/world), then most importantly the character or characters interactions in that setting (events & interactions). Also editing shouldn't ever kill a good plot-line just to save ""face"".

If they can nail these three things it will indeed catch my continued interest. I highly recommend watching the series & the especially the turning point episode: ""Trigger-finger"" If you have been watching up to this point. I'm a survivalist fan, the type that likes extremes like zombies, apocalypse, mystery, post-apocalypse, the doomsdays stuff within practicality (or scientific reason rather) or sci-fi occasionally.

4818367,2,B005LAJ23A,"I am sorry but I'm gonna have to agree with other critics that this show is no longer the same. It's just a soap opera with zombies. It is really no longer about the zombie apocalypse, survival, being on the road or trying to figure out what happened. All that urgency is gone. As someone stated, it is about the petty quarrels of a bunch of people who seem to have missed the memo that the world has come to an end. I mean really who cares about who slept with who and who is the father of whose baby, or the ex lover going ballistic. There is just a whole set of petty dramas surrounding these people like that whole Maggie confronting Hershel about his drinking again thing given that he is an alcoholic; crying about her sister and reciting an old story between them to Andrea, as if we are supposed to care about a character who is a notch above an extra in terms of acting presence and never uttered a sentence in the show.

Look, we've seen this type of stuff done million times in day time soap and Lifetime Television for women. So how is this unique? It is in so far maybe in that it takes place in the zombie context as opposed to some other disaster. By firing Darabont the focus of the show has starkly shifted from surviving the apocalypse and just THE apocalypse to one about the characters and truly trivial quarrels. This show has taken on a whiny, cranky soapy tone with zombies thrown in to appear original as soap operas have some sort of a negative stigma of lameness and chick flick associated with them. But really, it is the same, just different packaging. All that crying and wheeping and being caught up with personal love triangles when the world has ended seems out of place and ridiculous.  This show really is no longer about the end of the world but about people under pressure, which could easily then be a myriad of situations in which people are under pressure. When you reach a point in your story where one of its main premises (i.e. zombie apocalypse) can be easily exchanged with something else (like viral outbreak or flood or nuclear blast) and nothing about the story and the characters within would change, you know you are in trouble and have met a dead end in terms of originality.

Dont be fooled by all the sneak peaks that seem interesting, as soon as you get to the actual show itself all you might get is about 2-3 min of zombies.

I watched it on TV when it first came out and re-watched it at least 3 times on DVD.  Great, great season!  Now let me talk about how season 2 compares.  I don't think it has the same punch as season 1, because S1 was so surreal.  It introduced us to this doomsday land where hope is minimal.  It made us as viewers aware of a reality that cannot exist in our minds.  That's a big part of what made it so powerful.  But as season 2 is a continuation, how can it possibly reintroduce us to what we already know about the situation?  If it went on about how life became this way for the characters, it'd just be very repetitive.  Season 2 focus' on character development.  It introduces us further into the lives and minds of Rick & crew.  No, there aren't any epic Zombie apocalyptic scenes filmed in downtown Atlanta, we're passed that.  S2 is showing the characters finally being able to settle in, although not without a TON of drama.  I'm not going to spoil any scenes, but S2 has it's fair share of intense scenes.  Honestly I can't understand all the dissatisfaction from some fans of S1.
Lastly I will add that I am NOT a follower of the comic series, which may have something to do with the negative reviews, i'm not sure.

Really amazing Zombie gruesomeness. **SPOILER** That zombie squeezing it's face through the broken glass. EEWWWW!! And I mean that in the best way possible!! **END SPOILER**

I'm interested to see how the show writers deal with the psycho Shane situation. I know they said they'd follow the outlined path of the graphic novels but they did say every once in a while they'd head off in their own direction for a bit...

I loved that they were on the road before. I suppose what worries me is that they are never going to leave that farm. The way that the episodes end seem to be straying away from how they did before. Things just seem to be slowing down a little more. I was glad that there was a little more action in this episode, but for some reason it feels like something is missing. It almost feels like the show is dragging its feet. It seems to be just the drama around Shane and Lori. It does make me wonder what will happen with his character though. I hope that he doesn't leave the show. I'll still be tuning in, but I'm hoping that things pick up. It is starting to remind me of that Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles. That show started off strong and kept going, but eventually, it just became more and more dialogue and started falling apart. I'm not comparing every aspect of both shows, just merely drawing a very broad comparison with my tentative feelings.

What ever happened to MORGAN & DUANE? Whatever happened to MERLE? At the end of Season 1 DR. JENNER said the French were the longest ones to hold out looking for a cure. He whispered something into RICK's ear. What did he whisper? Is there ever going to be a pay off for that?

Season 1, had multiple locations, an epic journey into Atlanta, time on the road, the CDC, action, conflict, meaningful character conflict and interaction... all in 6 episodes.
Season 2, has had 9 episodes of JACK... I literally can only remember 1 or 2 mildly significant character events, that did nothing to advance the story... What used to be a tense event now might as well be the freakn survivor, with a bunch of twits bitching at each other... Seriously, the show is SUPPOSED to be about zombies, but there have been maybe 15 mins of zombie action in the entire second season.

I think the producers felt safe when they saw the numbers... They maybe thought they could sit on their hands and maybe rack up 12 seasons, using the great material already in Kirkman's comic. Yes, I liked season 1 so much I went and read the first series of comics in my life... There is enough material there for 5+ seasons (and counting) of the best show on TV. If they stretch it to 12, it will be cancelled by season 4.

They are absolutely blowing it... If they don't get back on track I AM GOING TO QUIT WATCHING. These episodes can be summarized in sentences, it's a joke.

4818471,5,B005LAJ23A,"""Triggerfinger"" is the second episode in the second half of Season 2 of  AMC networks Zombie thriller ""The Walking Dead""

SPOILERS

This episode picks up where the last left off, as it follows Rick, Hershel and Glen and concludes with a gunfight at the deserted tavern in the near dark. Spooky and tense on its own, but terrifying when you realize that the Zombies are never very far away. The results look to make a significant impact back at the farm. Also featured is Lori's car wreck and her harrowing tale of her escape while encountering some Zombies.

END SPOILERS

In addition to the two main story lines mentioned above, this episode features a lot of raw emotion being shown between several individuals... emotions that seem sure to lead to more internal conflicts between our original survivors and the farm denizens as well.

Conclusion:
Again, great acting and a near perfect blend between action and drama. A story of survival... and survival means avoiding Zombies when possible and killing them when it's not. Great directing and outstanding camera work that captures those fleeting emotional nuances that come and go in a split second.

A great series; a great individual episode.

4818472,2,B005LAJ23A,"the ending of episode 9 was predictable and very poorly written. the writer sure wasn't being too creative there. overall the episode gets a grade of 'E"" for lacking creativity and substance in the script and writing and final presentation.",1329696000,2,240,5.025
4818473,2,B005LAJ23A,"With this episode, it becomes clear that Shane's mask of sanity is lowly slipping and that he has turned almost delusional with regard to Lori and the baby that he thinks is his. Delusional in the Fatal Attraction sort of way. He is starting to think that he and Lori really had something deep and meaningful going on during those couple of weeks where they thought Rick was dead and it looks like confrontation with Rick is going to be inevitable as Shane is slowly losing it. In fact, it looks like Shane is going to mix it up with someone soon and pull the trigger again. Maybe it is the trauma that ensues from living in a world post apocalypse where everything you have ever known is gone or maybe it is because Shane has always been kind of unstable, violent and and an a_hole and it is all surfacing just now that this thin veneer we call civilization has vanished.

Whatever it is, Shane is ""falling down"" and it becomes increasingly more clear to everyone that they're gonna have to worry about him just as they have to with Walkers. I used to root for Shane because what he said made sense, but he has pretty much crossed the line into instability and psychosis and he will be dangerous.

As I write this, I realize how truly ridiculous and boring this show has turned otherwise. I mean, the main point of contention seems to be the love triangle and the ever prevailing ""who is the father of my baby"" question. The other characters have sort of been moved to the background as we hardly ever hear anything from them anymore and it seems to be the ""love birds"" (Shane, Rick and Lori/Glenn and Maggie) whose storylines matter. Everyone else seems to be serving in a merely ornamental capacity or to move the storyline along (like Dale every now and then serving as a voice of caution to warn others just so he can go back to what he did, whatever that might be. Or T-Dog whose role has been reduced to that of scene filler at this point, or Andrea whose character and its agony, which had been so beautifully initiated, have been reduced to some one dimensional ""extra"", loading dead bodies into trucks or running errands).

I don't know why everyone says that there is great character development, when the only characters who are being developed, if you can call it that, are the ""Romantics"".

Carol and Darrell also always seem to be having the same ""conversation"" - and with that I mean Darrell throwing a hissy fit like a child who lost his puppy after a week's search and don't want loving anyone no more anymore, calling everyone a ""bit/ch"" while Carol gives him teary eyed looks or throws a line at him and walks away, just so they can resume where they left off the next time. Yes i understand Darrell is hurt that the search for Sofia ended so tragically, but he's been just  grunting into the camera for the last three episodes with no end in sight. Hardly character development.

This episode was 2 stars tops, mainly because it is just not moving along - just as apparently the entire second season and because this show is no longer really about what it set out to be. The zombie background is purely incidental. It could be WWIII or a natural disaster or hey, even Melrose Place.

So in summary, that soapy, stagy love triangle drama and who is the father of my baby plot lines have degraded this show to just another soap opera but in a zombie setting as opposed to a more contemporary one. I mean really? A jilted lover vowing to take revenge and becoming psychotic is nothing original, even if it is set against a zombie backdrop. Whereas season 1 and even the beginning of season 2 (i.e. before they landed on this ""Farm of our Discontent"") were looking at the problem of a world ravaged by disease and having come to an end (note the flashbacks they had about how it all started), most of season 2 has unfortunately been about the marital problems of Rick and Lori and Shane's insanity. How the apocalypse began, what Jenner said, all those discussions about the human soul, whether there are any last outposts left and just the setting, which after all is one of zombies, have been muted.

It really no longer is about the end of the world. It is about petty people who seem to have missed the memo about the world having come to an end and who, as a result, engage in these petty quarrels with one another as if nothing had changed.

This show was great because it looked at the whole picture: zombie apocalypse, the struggle to survive and character development, the science behind the disease, the grander questions of survival, traversing the tough road. Now it is just focusing on the personal dramas of a few characters who seem to live in their own bubbles. Disappointed is an understatement. They writers go on like this and this show will get cancelled mid season 3. It is a shame because it was so damn good in the beginning.

For people who enjoy this kind of whiny, cranky stuff, it will be just fine and you'll like it, but for people looking for more depth and just something filled with less cliches and predictable story lines, I am afraid you will be disappointed. I was.",1329696000,11,5118,4.493548387096774

4818475,5,B005LAJ23A,"This was the best course correction episode ever. David Johnson (writer) really outdid himself from his previous effort ""Chupacabra"" where Daryl was acting irrationally and against character. It was a bad tee shot, but not the worst of the series. And he made up for it. Here, both the farm and the bar storylines progress with characters talking and acting sensibility, solving little but important plot problems (these two guys we killed have friends outside!), and all using the storyteller's creed: show the audience, don't just tell us. The pontificating of characters, even when accurate, was dogging this show. Badly. Slowing the pace of everything else while we were told, seemingly endlessly, about the problems of group living, security, welfare, children, etc. Now however, we get to see why. My interest was piqued the entire episode, which has not happened since season one. Every person on screen added something to the plot, their own exposition made sense (Glenn and Shane most notably), and most importantly of all, actual ACTION happened to help move events from A to B. And that's the thing: this is a zombie show, no argument. (The cheek scraping off in the car was gruesomely awesome.)

4818477,5,B005LAJ23A,"Since the premiere of 'The Walking Dead', I have been a huge and faithful fan.  I never miss an episode.  At least, if the weather permits.  Unfortunately, this past Sunday, February 19th 2012, we had so much snow in my area that the Satellite went out.  I was  unable to see my episode on AMC like all of the other faithful followers of the series.  So, I turned to the next best thing, AMAZON INSTANT WATCH!

I am so happy that Amazon has this series available and that they update the episodes so quickly.  I don't think I could have waited another week to catch up on my #1 favorite Zombie Apocalypse show!!!!

The Walking Dead is based on the novels but it has so much more to offer.  This series does not follow the novels precisely.  No!  It takes its own life!!!

The world has fallen prey to an apocalypse where zombies aka Walkers roam the earth, looking for something or someone to eat.  If you are not fast enough, careful enough, or smart enough, then you are nothing but a dead man walking, seriously.  There is plenty of horror and suspense in this series.  Lots of blood and guts, too, but what I love most is the development of the characters within the series and their relationships between one another.  You do not only have a horror flic, but a depiction of the life of the survivors who go day by day, struggling to make it without being bitten or scratched.

As the characters develop and grow, there are some definite changes that this new world of horror and death has forced upon them.  The most noteworthy, especially in this episode called Triggerfinger, is Rick's understanding of the way things work.  Once a Sheriff's Deputy who did all he could to make things right, now he must kill to keep those he loves safe.  In a world where the dead walk, the living must do all that they can to survive, and at any means necessary, Rick has just come to terms with these facts after having to put down one of his own.  Faced with no other alternative, he is slowly becoming something he never wished to become, but what choice does he have?

He has a wife, child, and a baby on the way.  His responsibilities to those  he protects is worth more than any moral standing or codes that were once part of the way of each and every human being.  If he and the others are to survive, they must be prepared to sacrifice everything.  Many, including Shane, have already begun to walk down that path.  It is up to Rick to catch up and prove his place in their group.  If he doesn't, there is no telling what will happen should his loyalty and, most importantly, his ability to lead and make the best decisions be questioned.  Already there are signs of discourse flowing between group members.

At the very end of Triggerfinger, Rick and Lori are speaking about Shane, and one can tell that Rick's resolve to protect his family is hardening.  You can tell it in his eyes as you watch them become detached and void of any previous semblance of his former self.  It is killed or be killed in this new world, and Rick refuses to be the one to die, not when his wife and children are depending on him.  Nothing and no one will stand in his way and keep him from his family....

Maybe not even his long time friend Shane....",1329696000,7,3233,4.376470588235295

I was seriously hoping - praying - that with an episode titled ""Nebraska"" that we would be leaving the farm. The Walking Dead has been at its best as the cast moves from location to location facing unpredictable challenges along the way. We've been in the farm vacation for a long time now.

- 10 minute climax in which something at least mildly interesting happens, giving the viewer hope that the next episode might be worth watching without the fast forward button.

I'm ready for the gang to get back on the road and advance the story. Sadly, AMC's listings for the rest of the season indicate [*slight spoiler*] they won't be leaving the boring old farm for the foreseeable future.

4818497,5,B005LAJ23A,"""Nebraska"" is the first episode in the second half of Season 2 of the AMC TV show ""The Walking Dead"".

Another terrific episode in this outstanding series in which the survivors deal with the aftermath of the 'barn' incident, Hershel's disappearance and Laura's car drive.

Impressions...

Some complain about the lack of action, but this episode (and the others in Season 2) are more than just encounters with Zombies (although there are plenty of those). What makes this show so special (at least to me) is...

1.) the acting...and not just by one or two. The entire cast is great.

2.) the method in which the plot is slowly advanced to build a tension filled atmosphere that usually leads to one or more focal points in each episode.

3.) the different personalities that make up the survivor group... a fragile mix of emotions that are liable to explode at any moment and often do.

4.) new developments are brought into play just as one flash point is finally put to rest, resulting in another tense, edgy ending for this particular show. You could just feel it coming... loved it!

Conclusion:
A Zombie TV adventure with as good as acting and plot writing as your ever likely to encounter.

Check with the Preppers they have that stuff now, if you hadn't noticed.  And also get OFF the farm.  Just go.  Get off the FARM already.

Less Green Acres and more Book of Eli, Road Warrior 1, War of the Worlds.

Other than that, it's a continuation of what made Season 2A so poor - lots of talking with absolutely little being resolved by the end of the 43 minutes. Had they kept Darabont on board, kept the bigger budget and stayed true to the feel created in the early part of Season 1, Season 2 would/should have been stellar. But alas, AMC is going the cheap route (fewer zombies and less action, limited location shooting). As it is, we spent all of Season 2A running around in a circle with a less-than stellar ending. ""Nebraska"" does little to ensure that Season 2B is going to be anything special, seemingly drawing an even smaller circle within.

There are a couple of things that happened briefly, but I'm sure that they will be covered in the next or oncoming episodes. Rick steps up and shows why he is still in charge, meanwhile, Shane's instability continues to grow. If you follow the show I'm sure that you won't be disappointed with this episode either.

4818533,5,B005LAJ23A,"*This review is for the current episode only and not the entire show*

With this episode, The Walking Dead has finally picked up in intensity. ""Nebraska"" was reminiscent of the kind of breathtaking and gripping episodes we got to see in the first season as it was intelligent, thought provoking and tackled some of the tough issues from the inside out. It also finally got off that sanctimonious tone we had to endure for the most part of the second season where everyone sort of agreed that Shane was wrong and the bad guy and Hershel had a valid point. Rick also finally gets some things about the reality of their situation into his head and reaches a pivotal moment.

The line of who is good and bad and what is wrong and what is right is a thin one. Dale walks around warning everyone that Shane is dangerous and that he murdered Otis, but the bar scene with those two shady guys with a murderous agenda showed us that they were going to need someone of Shane's attitude to handle the situation; Rick had to do what needed to be done. Simple as that. For the first time he stood on the other side of the fence where Shane usually stands, where tough decisions have to be made. It was clear from the way the two guys behaved that they were going to be worse than the Walkers: the fat dude was already talking about pretty much raping women if he got his fingers on some and the other one gave off a creepy, dangerous vibe and pulled the gun on Rick. Rick had to act in a split second and make that call and he made the right call. The question now is: is Shane really a bad guy? What is good and bad anymore in this world? In this reality? Had Shane not sacrificed Otis, Carl would have died just as Rick, Hershel and Glenn would have died had Rick not killed the two intruders.

This show is great at showing us how humans behave, on the deepest level, when their existence is threatened. It was very realistic and it begs the question of whether you can afford to still live by the old rule book, as Rick insists, in a world that has no rules anymore; no societal ones at least (hence that guy pi$$ing right in the corner of the restaurant, like an animal in the wild, and not even bothering to step out. He doesnt need to. Who is going to stop him? The owner? The cops?)

Shane was a man of the law before the fall, yet after the world came to an end, he just had to make some tough decisions - first small ones, then big ones, such as sacrificing Otis to make it out; he did things he would never have done before. This show is doing a great job at getting to the bottom of that pit and digging through what is the human aspect; the human heart.  The desperation and existential desolation these people are facing in a world gone under and ravaged by disease is palpable, especially during the conversation Rick and Hershel have in the bar about hope and what to live for anymore in the face of such apocalyptic devastation.

(On a side note, does anyone else think that the girl who is all sick might actually be turning to a Walker? They say she is burning up which is usually a sign of having gotten sick. Not sure, but thought this was interesting.)

Lastly, I loved that hopefully with Lori's accident, they might actually put an end to this stupid and ridiculous pregnancy story line that's just degraded the show to soap opera level. The only misgiving I have is more of an afterthought really, which is that I hope they really will NOT stay on little house in the prairie much longer. The show needs to move on. I mean it is becoming pretty obvious that they are forced to work on low budget so they've been at the same location for the entire season so far. That's not good. The introduction of these two strangers put tension in the show which was great and we need more of that. I don't think most people would want to see another 12 episodes of these people working through their feelings and emotions with zombies thrown in for fun. They really should never have fired Darabont. He was the one who made this show the breathtaking piece we got to see in season 1.",1329091200,8,4083,4.301690507152146

If you don't remember anything from the first half of the season, perhaps watch episode 7 again, but if it's fresh in your mind at all, just jump right into this one.

4818571,1,B005LAJ23A,"I happily bought the first season on blu-ray, but i will not spend a dime on the second season, purely an emo soap opera. What a let down. One can hope AMC will get back to Frank Darabont vision....The Walking Dead's second season premiered last fall to huge ratings and a fan response even bigger than the series premiere back in 2010. But according to former showrunner Frank Darabont, those same AMC budget cuts that helped drive him from the series also prevented his awesome idea to start season two with a prequel episode that would have put us inside a zombie war zone.

In The Walking Dead's first season we got a good look at the ruined city of Atlanta and the zombies that still occupied it as Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) went searching for his family and found another gang of survivors instead. One of the more memorable sequences from the storyline found Rick trapped in a tank with a zombie soldier, who you might have recognized as Being Human's Sam Witwer.

It looks like an amusing little cameo from an actor Darabont worked with on The Mist, but in a video interview posted Jan. 3, Witwer revealed that his brief appearance was actually the setup for a potential prequel story.

""If you look closely, I played that zombie, because we were setting up this prequel we were going to do. If you watch the pilot of The Walking Dead, that's me in the tank as the zombie, and then Rick blasts him and he gets deafened, and he gets that grenade which saves him at the end of the season,"" Witwer said.

The prequel revolving around Witwer's zombie soldier was, predictably, nixed because of budget cuts. He may have a sweet gig on Being Human these days, but Witwer's still not happy that AMC let Darabont and all his awesome ideas go.

""It's not happening now. Why? Because AMC wanted to save a few bucks. That is just one example of the kind of cool, awesome forethought [Darabont] has put into this show that is now absolutely written off,"" Witwer said. ""For me it doesn't matter much, because I'm busy doing Being Human. We were going to schedule things around. I'm not lamenting the loss of a job, I'm lamenting the loss of an amazing idea. And there are dozens and dozens of amazing ideas just like that which are now gone.""

CraveOnline initially reported that the concept was going to be used for a web series, but when Darabont responded to the story in a letter to Ain't It Cool News, he said it was actually the plan for the whole season-two premiere.

""The idea was to do this with a very focused 'you are there' documentary feel. Not going all shaky-cam, but still making it a bit rawer and grainier than the rest of the show,"" Darabont said. ""We'd start with a squad of maybe seven or eight soldiers being dropped into the city by chopper. They have map coordinates they need to get to; they've been told to report to a certain place to provide reinforcement. It's not a special mission, it's basically a housekeeping measure putting more boots on the ground to reinforce key intersections and installations throughout the city. And we follow this group from the moment the copter sets them down.""

Basically the idea was to do a kind of Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down with zombies. What starts as a simple mission would have all gone to hell, but over the course of the episode we would have also had a chance to run into a few familiar faces.

""Picture our squad arriving at a manned barricade where some civilians are being held back from leaving the city on shoot-to-kill orders to stop the spread of contagion, it's a panicked high-intensity scene, and in this crowd of desperate people we find Andrea and Amy,"" Darabont said. ""The barricade gunners panic, the civilians start to get mowed down by machine gun fire, and in this melee the girls get pulled to safety by some old guy they don't even know. It's Dale. He's nobody to them, just some guy who saw the opportunity to do the right thing and reacted in the moment. This would have been perhaps a minute or two of the episode, just a cool detour like the various outposts the soldiers encounter in Saving Private Ryan, but we would have witnessed the moment that Dale meets Andrea and Amy, seen where that relationship began.""

The episode would have ended with Witwer's character as the last man standing, reaching the coordinates the squad was supposed to hit even though he'd already been bitten by the undead. He crawls into the tank, prepared to commit suicide by grenade, then dies instead. Darabont then wanted to time-lapse into a shot-for-shot reprise of Rick entering the tank and encountering Witwer's zombie.

""The notion was to take the 'throwaway' tank zombie Rick encountered in the pilot, and tell that soldier's story,"" Darabont said. ""Make him the star of his own movie, follow his journey, but don't reveal who he is until the end. The idea being that every zombie has a story, every undead extra was once a human being with a life of his/her own ... was, in a sense, the star of his own life's movie. And we've followed this one particular guy and seen how his life ended; we witness his struggles, see his good intentions and his failures, and we experience his godawful death in this tank. That's why I cast Sam as that tank zombie in the first place instead of just casting some extra. I had this story in mind while filming the pilot, and I knew I'd need a superb actor to play that soldier when the time came.""

Darabont also noted that the idea of a ""wild card"" episode focusing on a character we're not used to meeting was one he would have liked to continue as the series progressed. But of course, none of that will happen now. Darabont is gone and the show goes on, but at least we can think about what might have been.",1328832000,44,5742,4.531853281853282
4818572,5,B005LAJ23A,"I must say despite this season being more slow than last season. I find it works for the series and the overall story. Yes no doubt this show is called the Walking Dead and it has zombies in it however the show is about people interacting in a broken rule. If you don't think this is true and if you think that all zombie films or tv shows should be just mindless entertainment then you need to think again. The Walking Dead is taking on the kinda of story telling that George Romero does. Themes of greed, racism, distrust, and the line between surviving and living were evident in Romero's films as they are in this show. Despite what people might say about this show, it can't just be about zombies. This is not a two hour movie were character development is done in a hour. In order to be a good tv show, no matter the genre, no matter the subject. You have to keep people invested in the characters.  One of the reasons Dexter is so popular is because of this. The Walking Dead first and foremost is a drama. I know that is how AMC presented it to the guys behind the comic and they obviously agreed. Yes the show has to keep the suspense, action, and horror of people living in a world filled with zombies but what is refreshing is to see a show go back to the roots of a genre that has been over killed and reduced to mindless entertainment like the Resident Evil movies which after the second film went downhill. I think the acting is top notch especially from Norman Reedus who plays Daryl.",1328745600,4,1499,4.296819787985866

4818575,5,B005LAJ23A,"""The Walking Dead"" (Season 2) is a Zombie tale in the form of an eight part mini series on the AMC network. The first show was two hours in length and was followed by seven segments that were each a hour in length.

The entire second season of ""The Walking Dead'"" is unbelievably good. Great acting of interesting characters that have such a diversity of personalities, highlight this intriguing series. Couple the acting with a suspenseful story with life and death implications, creepy settings and the occasional unexpected attack and you have a series to keep you on the edge of your seat.

I noticed some other reviewers complained that there was not enough action, or less action than in Season 1 and that may be true to a point. But this season, to me, was much better because of the emotional build-up in some of the scenes. Things that lead to some unpopular but decisive decisions making... decisions that sometimes had repercussion that were of mammoth proportions in the overall scope of this ongoing tale. I found it very easy to become totally immersed in this thrilling series.

The finale ending... violent, yet stunningly heart-rendering and somehow cathartic. So far I've watched the last few minutes four separate times and oh my... the acting, the raw, visceral emotion... just gut wrenching. Hard to express in words the impact of this visual experience... best to see it yourself.

I can hardly wait for the rest of Season 2.

This is what made Season One great. Season two, has almost none of this at all. No heart rending turnings of bite victims, not brains or viscera getting dined on, few head shots, screams, terror or any of the things that are great about Zombies vs. survivors.

I don't know if one of the original producers of the show quit, but someone has taken what was a once a gripping, cinematic masterpiece and pushed it off a cliff.  I honestly don't see how this show will last beyond perhaps a 3rd Season if it continues in this direction.

You have to go back and watch Season 1 to really appreciate how good the show started out compared to where the writers, producers and directors have taken it to now.  They should hire Vince Gilligan as a consultant because the writing and dialogue is just so unconvincingly bad.

ETA:  I did a little digging and found out why the show took a nosedive.

Frank Darbont was fired from the show over production costs!  No wonder the high production value of the 1st Season is such a high contrast to the budgeted soap opera of Season 2.  What a shame.

As Anthony Ocasio of Screen Rant writes:

""Even though The Walking Dead proved to be a hit - and it is the only series that AMC owns completely - the network had already announced to the producers that they would not only be cutting the budget of the series from $3.4 million to $2.7 million, but that they would also want 13 episodes produced instead of 6 episodes that made up its first season. To make matters worse, AMC also told the producers that the 30% tax credit that the series receives from filming in Georgia would go directly to the network, and not make up for some of the money that was taken out of the production budget.

AMC's fiscal irresponsibility and their lack of appreciation for those who make The Walking Dead is largely what led to Darabont being fired. Originally taking the announcement of a second season budget cut in stride, the producers of the series decided to wait until the first season premiered. After The Walking Dead began breaking ratings records for the network, the producers assumed their budget wouldn't be cut as much as originally thought.""

Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened - and Darabont wasn't too happy about it. Known as a man who fights for what he believes in, a confrontation between AMC and The Walking Dead producers occurred. With the head of original programming for AMC, Joel Stillerman, sticking to the cut budget, the network than began to overstep their bounds and attempt to tell Darabont how to produce the series.

Instead of long, sprawling outdoor scenes, the network wanted the second season of The Walking Dead to occur 50% outdoors and 50% indoors (indoors being cheaper to film). Another note asked whether or not the audience had to always see the zombies - couldn't they simply hear them sometimes.""",1325721600,7,2784,4.71340206185567

Hopefully the writers are finally off their sleep meds and the second half of season 2 will live up to season 1.

Recommendations to the writers:  1) Turn Lori Grimes (Sarah Callies) into a walker.  Please.  We'd finally be done with her incessant whining and angst.  She wasn't terribly likable on Prison Break and she's downright awful here.  Get Rick a new love interest (and Carl a new mommy.)  2) Bring back Morgan and Duane. Lots of potential story lines for Duane and Carl. 3) Expand the story line for Glenn (Steve Yuen) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan).  Theirs is the only truly interesting relationship in the series at this point.  4)Matches that should be made:  Andrea and Daryl (or Andrea and Dale?).  Also, Carol and Dale (or Carol and Daryl?).

4818653,5,B005LAJ23A,"I'm not much for zombie shows or movies of any kind.  It's the human aspect of the show that drew me in.  What they do, how they survive, the relationships that are made when the basic tenents of society as we know it have been broken down.  I'd watch something like that even if there were no zombies.  However, the zombies aspect of this show adds a wonderful scary element of danger that can't help but make one wonder what they themselves would do in such a situation.  This is a drama.  It's people plucked out of every day life and dropped into a new and terrifying world that looks exactly the same.  It's about how they survive. It's not meant to be about zombies macking on people for an hour.  Though the fact that that could happen does make it interesting.  The zombies themselves are disgustingly well done and gross and the gore is quite graphic and realistic.  When a zombie bites into someone's neck and rips the flesh free and blood spurts and sprays...it looks real.  There is a very disgusting scene involving a well in Season 2 that I will not go into other than to say...Wow.  I've seen R rated horror movies that weren't that well done or dramatic.  Granted, the zombies are thankfully dense and sheeplike and they have only one purpose.  To feed.  On you.  Add in a little imagination as to how you would survive in such a world and the show is quite compelling.

I won't get into characterization too much other than to say there is a hodge podge to choose from. Some you will like, some you wont.  Some will be easy to identify with and others will really make you think about what choices YOU would make in their place.

4818656,3,B005LAJ23A,"I found this season to be a frustrating watch. In most instances, the characters were not making sane decisions (the well incident in ""Cherokee Rose"" is a big blunder - as another reviewer once noted, why not go back to the highway and and bring back water from the truck they found in ""What Lies Ahead"").

The writing also seemed less smart, more melodramatic and as the episodes progressed I felt like I was watching a bad version of Survivor that just happened to feature zombies (actually... ""a bad version of Survivor""...I'm giving the reality show too much credit...nonetheless...back to my point).

I would say this was my favourite episode. Shane is my least favourite character but I would back him in a fight. A bit of a sociopath, he is closer to the voice of reason than Rick by the season's end. The finale outside of the barn was a kind of refreshing reality check for all the characters, even Rick. Though there was a layer of melodrama. Rick taking the scene closing shot, in a sense, ending what he started was a nice touch. Though I have to admit, I had a feeling it was going to end that way.

Overall, this episode did save the season but not by much. If Season 3 is anything like Season 2 and less like Season 1, I'm going to stop watching. I noticed a drop in film quality as well.

However, I feel that the conversations this seasons is less realistic and if this was really going on would not be so polite. The first seasons talking parts didn't seem as bad. Honestly, if I was with a group and a man that just woke up to find out it was the end of the world started leading and kept bring us to dead ends I would so peace out. I really don't understand as well why no one has ever seen a zombie movie before. If more common knowledge was in there, the talking parts would be more tolerable.

I don't mind dialogue and I certainly don't need non-stop action to enjoy a show, but the second season dialogue in Walking Dead is unbelievably dull. You watch it and have the feeling that the writers are just trying to fill up time so they don't have to film any expensive zombie crowd scenes. Thus the blond girl and the old guy, for example, have about one predictable head-to-head an episode. These scenes aren't particularly dramatic, and they don't seem to deepen our knowledge of the characters or move the plot forward: they just seem to be taking up time. The point is that sure, the show LOOKED a lot better when Frank Darabont was more involved (and the budget was bigger), but more importantly, there weren't these pointless dull pseudo-emotional conversations. The show was better dramatically, too. There is a good surprise in this episode, but the show continues on the downward slide it's been on the whole second season.",1325030400,7,997,4.83625730994152

What really got me about the first season is the mix of a human drama with a little zombie apocalypse - lots of tension without relying on gore. Season 2 ... I'm seriously 1 or 2 more yawners away from canceling my season pass. I can not believe how long they drug out this whole Sophia missing / life on the farm thing. Each episode seems to have about 1 interesting thing occur, with about 40 minutes of filler. And to be honest, I wouldn't mind the filler if it was helping establish a character, but it fails to do even that. We still know very little about any of the character's past;  we still know extremely little about the events that lead up to the apocalypse or how far it's even spread.

4818829,1,B005LAJ23A,"The pilot of this series was a good piece of work for television. Season one was short, but the quality mostly held up. This isn't great drama here. Its the traditionalist survivalist storyline thats been done so many times before. I don't usually like this kind of thing much, but the first season held my attention first for the quality and second for a certain degree of originality.

But the second season is a waste of time. The budget of the series has been cut to nothing. Cheap props, cheap effects and every old trick-in-the-book is employed to cut the budget down to almost nothing. They hardly have sets and props. They pull out the old gimmick of the-search-for-the-lost-character and the injured-character-who-must-stay-in-bed to reduce the effective cost of the cast. We even get the very old ""single-character-lost-in-the-woods"" episode.

And you can tell that the network or the producer must have been screaming at them about female viewer demographics because they pull out everything in that bag too: (1) endless relationship melodrama, (2) the lost/missing child, (3) pregenancy melodrama. (4) child in the hospital (5) constant bitching combined with threats of suicide and on and on. The story and the writing are just plain bad now.

The entire season consists of mostly having the cast stand around at a farm. Even among cheap shows, this show sets a new standard for cheap. AMC had a huge ratings winner with this thing. But it looks like they the cut the heart out of it and put every cent they had into their deadwood-derivative ""hell on wheels"".

The first few episodes in the first season were done at film quality. If the series doesn't turn around soon, any audience it has will start walking away.",1323216000,14,1729,4.910958904109589

4818834,5,B005LAJ23A,"I've never read the graphic novels, but this TV show has me hooked!  Season one set up a terrifying world, with more gore and action than season two, but the first set of episodes of season two contain a relative calm that contrasts well with the violence that the group has been faced with daily since the zombie ""epidemic"" began.  The show may be in a lull in terms of action/fighting/slaughter, but it maintains the fear within this lull through the scene at the school and the occasional walker, and is improving character development and the growing friction between members of the group when they are not fighting for their lives all the time.  Although Herschel's place appears to be a safe haven, the world outside is extremely dangerous and this security can't last while so many walkers are still out there.  This backdrop is maintained through the differing opinons of Shane and Rick, and the whole idea of a new baby coming into a world so devastated with horror.

Since a big theme in season two so far is whether to stay or go, the ""security"" of Herschel's farm is a good contrast to the constant danger in the city.  I am frustrated, however, that no one in the group has discussed with Herschel and his family the findings of the scientist at the research center.  As a veteranarian, Herschel ought to understand that if all of the brain is dead aside from activity in the brain stem, that he is not getting his wife and step-son back as people.  The personality, the emotions, speech and memory centers--the stuff that makes a person human is dead and decaying.  I find it interesting that he considers zombification an illness, but it's a brain destroying illness, and it gives pause to think about it compared to other brain illnesses.  For example, if a person in a non-zombie controlled world was to get a very bad brain illness in which their whole brain would decay away except for their lower brain and brain stem, would they want to live this way?  I would guess that many people would say, ""Pull the plug,"" especially knowing that they would also become bloodthirsty killers and try to eat their loved ones if they didn't.  If Herschel was informed about the scientific experiments that were done before the CFC shut down,  might think differently, being a scientist himself.  However, the way they have done the plot allows Herschel to firmly add a new way of thinking about the zombies, and I enjoy the new depth this brings to the whole idea.

I am intrigued by what the added characterization is bringing out in the group.  I think Rick, Lori, Glenn, Carl, Carol, Andrea and T-Dog are building on the previous characterization from series 1 and so far don't see much change from them.  However, Daryl, Shane, Dale, and Herschel are being explored and changing very much in the first section of season 2.

DARYL:  Daryl is definitely getting more likable, caring, and showing innate intelligence that was not always clear before and distinguishes him from his brother significantly.  It was interesting how Daryl kept himself going while injured with hallucinations of abuse and taunting.  It made me wonder how much he really misses his brother and family, and whether he could use the end of his previous life with that abuse to make himself a better person.  His knowledge of the Cherokee Rose, his kindness to Carol, and the fact that he twice saved T-Dog's life, despite being raised racist and T-Dog being responsible for his brother's death, is an important signal that there is more to him than the the hick tough guy he showed at first.  He almost dies finding a doll.  He brings Carol out to the rose and explains it to her.  He actually apologizes for calling Carol a bitch.  This man is now able to explore parts of himself that had been forced inside in his old life.

SHANE: I feel that Shane is getting a raw deal in his characterization overall in season 2 so far.  He is portrayed as becoming more and more out of control, murderous, and selfish and there is overshadowing that he may kill Rick to get Lori back.  I don't think this is fair as he obviously cares a lot for Rick, Lori, and Carl.  Think of his support of Rick when Carl was shot and Rick was in shock, particularly the scene in which he holds Rick's face to his and talks sense into him about keeping it together for his boy.  This scene between the two men is extremely moving and appears to be legitimate emotion on Shane's part.  Carl looks up to Shane, and although Lori is in denial of it, he is a great father figure to Carl, especially when Rick seems too busy leading to spend much time with his son, and was a big support to Lori in the beginning.  It takes two to have an affair, and I think Lori is being unfair having so much anger towards Shane when she does owe her life to him and as far as I can tell from the scenes at the hospital, I believe that Shane thought Rick had no chance.  Shane risked his own safety when tried to help barricade Rick's room as best he could before he had to leave to save himself and Rick's family.  I think the anger Shane shows is expected when Lori goes from loving him to hating him, and I will be disappointed if Shane becomes the ""bad guy"" in the show, suggested by the fact that he shot Otis, his dark secret that Dale throws at him telling him he is a dangerous man.  However, logically, he wouldn't have made it back alive with the necessary supplies to save Carl's life if he hadn't shot Otis, and he is trained as a cop to know what to do in situations like this.  Also, half of the group seemed to want to kill Otis for shooting Carl in the first place.  I don't think Shane is perfect--he flies off the handle too much and is on the offensive pretty much all the time.  However, he has done a lot of good for the group, leading them to safety in the first place, and has to control tons of emotion and joy lost and gained when Rick came back.  He is a trained policeman, used to using firearms as a way to resolve conflict, and is bound to have mixed emotions with all that has happened between him, Lori, Carl, and Rick.  To Lori, he has gone from appreciated hero to deceptive creep, and this is all due to the return of his best friend, whom he would have done anything for, but through his relationship with Lori, he will never again have the same kind of friendship with Rick and has in a way, lost him again.  I was touched by the look of joy on his face when he learned about Lori's pregnancy and his care for Carl is extremely obvious and not creepy at all.  I hope they are not going to turn Shane evil on us.

DALE:  Dale is showing more of his fatherly instinct to Andrea, although she is not appreciative of it and that seems to hurt him more than it should.  He always seems strong and kind, almost to the point of irritation, but it is getting over the top now now, verging towards becoming a weakness.  What do we know about him besides that he is a ""nice guy"" and he lost his family?  People turn to him for help with their problems, and he seems to think about things slowly and in a larger context than the present.  I like him and agree with his peaceful ideas in general, but I also think he is becoming more fragile this season.  He shouldn't have taken the guns and tried to bury them in swampland--whether he believes in them or not, the guns are an essential way to take down walkers from far away and half of the group risked their lives going back to the city to retrieve them.  Herschel is on the fence about letting them stay anyway; getting rid of the guns is a rash idea that seems to stem from his protective feelings for Andrea and not wanting her spending more time than necessary with Shane.  This goes against my perception of Dale from season 1--season 1 Dale would have discussed the guns more with the group--why is he trying to make decisions on his own, based seemingly on Andrea and her rejection of him as a parental figure and friend?  He is making rash decision based on emotions in the same way that he criticizes Shane for doing.  When he went to the woods, I didn't realize he had the guns but thought he was going to take his own life.  Dale is confusing, and changing from what he was, and I liked what he was.

HERSCHEL:  I already discussed my interest in Herschel's way of viewing zombification as an illness that could have a cure.  I thought he had a solid, respectable character until the last episode before the break (aka, when they find Sophia).  He appears to be a smart man; a man who saves lives and cares about people he knows whether or not they have become zombies.  I try not to apply frightening television to my own life, but I think I would be with Herschel on keeping my family alive as zombies.  It goes along with his apparently caring personality.  What doesn't make sense is that he is so opposed to the group staying on, aside from the fact that they could draw more zombies, however, episode 7 brings out a major secret as far as Herschel.  The discussion with his daughter hints at a perhaps less than kind Herschel in the past, but the main slap is Sophia.  Here are a group of people, risking everything daily to try to find her, and all along she is in the barn.  As it is Herschel and his grandson (I think) who seem to be the people who put the walkers into the barn, I just don't believe that he didn't think of saying, ""Wait, we picked up a little girl of that description in the past few days.  She's a walker now and in our barn.""  What does that say about him?  I know he doesn't want to have more people on his farm and wants to try to ride out the ""plague"" with his family close and safe and hopefully find a cure.  But to allow the group to risk their lives and  Carol to continue her hope when he has very recently put Sofia in with the zombies in the barn, show that there is a side to Herschel that is completely different.  I am waiting to see what happens after the break and who in the farm family knew about Sofia.

Overall, season 2 is keeping my attention as much as, if not more than season 1.  If you have missed it, you can purchase both season 1 and season 2, so far, and I would recommend it.  This show has something for the action-lover and for the emotional watcher, while also showing solid characterization and great acting.  Each episode unravels more of the plot and characters, and there has not been an episode this season so far that I have come away from thinking just, ""that was okay,"" because each episode has something in it that is thought provoking and hooks you, waiting for the next installment!

4818879,5,B005LAJ23A,"Season 1 would be best described as an immediate struggle for survival and adaptation to a post-apoc (ie Zombie takeover) type world. While it has a variety of characters it has direct confrontations with the Walkers in an urban type (even if you are outside direct city limits) atmosphere as people seek answers to what has happened and its extent.

Season 2 would be best described as Part2 to post-apoc living. Now that you are sure everything is FUBAR in the population centers the focus turns to how a group of survivors adapts to daily life as they get stranded in the country. The episode focuses on the intense conflict the stress of the new world provides.

Season 2, moves a little slower, focuses a bit less on Walkers and direct confrontations. It moves into a more developed drama in many ways. For me it took Episode 3or4 before I really warmed into the new location and couldn't wait for the next episode. Having finished Episode 6, I reflect upon this season as having been well developed.

Season 1 and Season 2 have the same genera / background, but they are certainly different in approach. Season 2 is not a continuation of the same, it really evolves from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of the crisis. Again I think this is good as trying to continue direct confrontations with Walkers would run out of originality and be a boring repeat. Instead, the show quickly shifted to a new focus that is running a nice course.",1322784000,,1427,4.588235294117647
4818880,5,B005LAJ23A,"First off, what the hell is a ""mid-season"" finale?! What happened to actual season finales? Haha, moving on. Now episode 7 was a great way to leave an audience hungry for more. I started watching this show thinking, cool, a show about zombie apocalypse. The first episodes of season 1 were filled with some well done but very familiar material. As if Darabont (the show's director) was paying homage to the zombie movies that have preceded it. There was a scene more than just reminiscent of 28 Days Later but I don't hold this against the show as it was done so well. Anyway, season 2 seemed to have slowed down from the blistering pace of season 1 but I don't really consider it so much slowing down as it is more of lulling the characters into a comforting place before unleashing hell on them once again. After all, this show is not about shooting zombies in the head, but about human survival in a world turned upside down. It asks many questions of it's audience and of it's characters.  And watching the cast's varied, not mention well acted, reactions to the circumstances are the main part of what I enjoy so much about this show. The high production values come in second. For a television series not on HBO or Showtime the special effects are phenomenal.

That said Daryl rocks! He's my number one, not as bat-sh** hot-headed as Shane, and not nearly as sentimental as Rick. Good guy that Daryl. Rick is the leader for a reason though, as Shane demonstrates quite plainly at the end of episode 7. I think Shane is a deushe, and his 100% survivalist mentality will get him killed. He's a man of pure instinct which pretty much make him an animal living amongst men (and women). Not that people aren't animals but whatever.  But I digress, I'm looking forward to February 12 when season 2 starts up again, and I'm hoping the fan base continues to grow so smart television dramas like this one continue to strive.",1322697600,3,1921,4.56231884057971

Just because the show doesn't have the characters fighting zombies constantly and excessive gore every step of the way, doesn't make it weak or boring. Perhaps people want the series to be like a gore filled horror movie with constant shows of spectacle. If I wanted to watch a bunch of spectacle then I would go just watch a fireworks show. And spectacle is one of the weakest elements of storytelling. It's cheap and meaningless.

Anyway, this episode delved deeper into Hershel's psyche and explores his fears and relationaships. It also shows Shane's descent into what can only be described as fearful despotism (at least, that is how i see it heading).
This is the episode where everybody finally finds out about the walkers in the barn.
To me, this was the most intense episode to date. Such strong emotions and relationships, both good and bad, have developed and are pretty much at the point of no return.

4818914,5,B005LAJ23A,"I am surprised that I am actually reading reviews on this episode, or am following this series so closely. I am a college student and am usually a reader. I stay away from television shows because of their lack of creativity and overall quality. This series is amazing. Kudos to the writers.

I think T-Dog's absence is ridiculous also, as another reviewer stated. After the first season and his brief shine when dealing with Meryl, he hasn't really played a part. He barely speaks or does anything. And it's pretty ironic seeing that a black guy is a lead with Rick in the comic. I am suspecting racism or a shift because AMC doesn't think America would like to see a black Tyrese as a lead? IDK we'll see if he is placed in the forefront, or if he is killed off in the next episodes/seasons.

Overall this episode was riveting! The climax was nice. I think Shane's behavior is excessive. It's not just bronze and brute force that's needed in this apocalyptic situation. It is the mind. It's BRAINS, coupled with controlled and concentrated bronze. Shane is good for manpower and for dire, instantly dangerous/sticky situations. Not for planning or anything else that is useful. Oh and he's good at teaching people how to shoot.

4818915,1,B005LAJ23A,"I agree this is boring. I feel like not even watching now. I don't know how they will salvage a 3rd season from this. It feels like an entirely different writer took over. This feels nothing like the first season, it is just boring.

I never would have thought it could be so boring. I mean its a zombie TV series. It is supposed to have action, adventure, mystery. Instead we get drama, completly out of place for the subject. Whiney actors who are stuck in their own self pity.

Drama is ok when done right. They do not do it right here. You can predict every plot twist. They use sterotypical un-original end of world drama. Like should a child be in this world? Sleeping with your husbands best friend. The old religious man on the farm. I am fine with boring story points like this normaly in action films. But this hardly has any action.

They need to fire some of the writers. Get the hell off the farm. I don't even know if I can watch another episode. Kill off the wife and baby, or kill off shane. I don't care which. Kill off the whiney suicidal lady, kill of the cancer chick. Bring in the black guy and his kid. Bring in some new more exciting less melodrama people.

As it stands now I can not recomend this. I doubt I will watch another episode likely I will wait till the end of the season and read about it. If it doesn't sound exciting I will just forget about this entirely.

Dissapointed season 1 was amazing. Best show in a long time. I would rather watch the news that any of the episodes so far of season 2.",1322524800,3,1530,4.226027397260274
4818916,5,B005LAJ23A,"This was a very good episode. Unlike other viewers, I would not classify the prior 3 or 4 weeks as ""slow."" This show -- like the comic books -- is not just about killing and dodging zombies. Instead, it is a complex television drama. So, if the characters are not slaughtering legions of zombies every week, I do not consider it a slow episode.  If the show were just about the zombies, it would not be rated as high as it is (I certainly would not watch it), and it would not have received such critical acclaim.

The episode answers a lot of questions, including the location of Sophia, the missing girl. That story line drained a lot of time from the show, but it does provide for a very dramatic conclusion.

Speaking of the conclusion, a lot of debates have taken place on Walking Dead fan pages about the appropriateness of Shane's behavior. Many fans of Shane say that his callousness and murderous zeal towards the zombies make him a stronger character. I encourage these individuals to reassess their evaluation by looking at the last moments of this episode. Although Shane claims to be a tough guy who could simply kill zombies ruthlessly, at the end of the show, he was paralyzed by painful emotions. Rick, on the other hand, was not. Throughout the series and in this episode in particular, Rick has managed to combine leadership with empathy, proving that one does not have to become blind to the suffering of others and place on layers of phony masculinity in order to survive.  Also, Shane's inability to move beyond Lori (they only had a brief affair), screams weakness.

Aside from the brilliance of the episode, I have 2 small complaints. The first one, I have already written about. The gender roles on the show are bothersome to me. The women are subservient and ""emotional."" The men are stoic and leaders. Glenn's girlfriend continues to play a Sybil role. In the previous episode she picked a fight with Glenn and then suddenly kissed him. She did it again in this episode.

Second, I am unhappy with the lack of use of T-Dog. At this point, his character is a mere token. Ironically, in the comic book, Shane is killed very early, and ""Tyrese"" (a black character), plays the lead with Rick. T-Dog only spoke 9 words in the last episode (yes - I counted). I would not be surprised if they kill him off the show. That would discard a lot of potential.

Despite these criticisms, I look forward to the seeing how the show progresses.",1322524800,10,2454,4.60183066361556

""Walking Dead"" isn't just the title of the series, it's an accurate description of its pacing.  I think they are deliberately adding lots of dialogue as a filler  --the actors get paid the same no matter how many lines they speak-- which saves AMC money (Frank Darabont, the director of season 1, was fired, apparently after arguments about budget cuts, and I can see why he'd argue now).  The cuts are pretty obvious, with almost no special effects and relatively scant makeup work, which is, I imagine, why we see so few zombies in a zombie movie.  And filming everything on the same location saves loads of money as well, thus we are stuck on Hershel's farm.  The show is still worth watching because of the acting and solid writing, but if it drops another notch in quality, if they penny pinch any more, it won't be.

Even if you have thought this season is a little too slow for your taste, your drudgery is not in vain.  Keep watching because the juice is worth the squeeze with this episode!

I have rarely experienced a show or movie or book that has magnified and manipulated that incredibly thin line between right and wrong like I've experienced with this season.  Each episode has been a gradual build up of pressure that's been so subtle, that you are just not ready for the explosion of this episode.  It hits you like a torrent of love, hate, fear, dread, hope, sadness and disgust.  I found myself stuck in the rifts of the character's fractured relationships, siding with one person in one minute then completely changing my mind the very next.  I am almost angry that the writers were able to manipulate me this much and shock me with plot twists that were right in my face that I just didn't see coming.  They way they pulled together the plot lines with such cohesiveness was amazing and satisfying, but also left it in such a way where I wish I had a time machine so I wouldn't have to wait until next week to see where in the hell they're going to take the story.

I hope it keeps up.  I can't believe Hershel turned out to be such a nut job.  ""Umm, they're zombies.  Duh!""  Either take over the farm (Shane's idea) or leave these nuts for Ft. Benning (also Shane's idea)...  Hershel has some serious issues and, IMHO, the further away the group is, the better off they will be.  If it weren't for killing Otis (hey, I'm a fat guy, too!), Shane would have turned out to be the hero of Season 2 and not Rick.  I agree that Rick is still stuck in the ""world that was"" and needs to grow a pair.

Now, I'm all for heading to Ft. Benning.  Seems like the reasonable thing to do, no?  But WE ALL KNOW that it'll likely be Zombie-central and lead us into Season 3 with more whining about why go on with life and all that.  Hopefully the writers have come up with something interesting and original.

4818935,5,B005LAJ23A,"Season 1 left me wanting more and season 2 has delivered it. As far as the romance goes with Glenn and Maggie, that's fine. It builds their relationship, and what could be brewing between Carol and Daryl. I find that interesting. The fact that Rick wanted Hershel to allow them to stay is because he is afraid for Lori b/c she's pregnant, and Carl. Yes, it's only been a few weeks since he found them, but who wouldn't see Hershel's farm as a safe haven for awhile. There are no walkers, there's food, fresh water, and a house for protection. Except of course for the walkers in the barn. Episode 7 gave it a heart wrenching twist, so I am drooling for the second part of season 2. Shane, even though quite the jerk to some people, tends to save the day. He has survival at all cost in his mind, as would I if I were in that situation. His character is everything Rick's character is not. which I'm inclined to say is going to get him killed eventually(foresight there nothing more). Bronze and muscle is great when dealing with the dead, but not with the living. with all his faults, however, he is my faviorite characters apart from Daryl. I would recommend to anyone to read the comics. They are just as great as the show, and believe it or not, Lori's pregnancy has alot to do with how the writers do the next few seasons/episodes.

4818958,2,B005LAJ23A,"A friend of mine who is a comic buff told  me that he stopped reading the comics after a while because they became increasingly more ""soap opera"" like and about characters and their feelings and relationships and less and less about the zombie apocalypse, immediate survival, the question of how it all happened and the end of the world. So I am afraid this show is headed in that direction as well. Already as it is, everything we have seen so far in this season, with the exception of the very first episode and then this episode, have been heading in that direction and if the intention of the writers is to make this show about some psychological expos  of its characters with the apocalypse and zombies thrown in there as the incidental backdrop, I am afraid it will be just downhill from there. I am sure lots of people are interested in that kind of story line but I think for those of us who are looking for more the disappointment is impending. I, for one, am certainly not interested in a series that studies how people act under pressure. That's just too easy.

Having to wait 6 episodes to get some much needed plot reward is not a great TV show maker, it is a sure recipe for impending cancellation.

That said, this episode should have been the third episode in the whole bunch instead of drawing things out painfully long for four or five episodes to get to this. They seriously need to take the direction away from the characters' mostly petty interpersonal relationships and strike a balance with regard to  character development and trying to answer some of the tough questions like they did in Season One when they went to the CDC. I still don't understand why throwing in one of the oldest cliches in soap opera history, like the pregnancy and ""who is the father of my child?"" could possibly be considered clever and intelligent plot elements.

The way they have portrayed most of the characters in this season has made liking them increasingly difficult. With the exception of Shane and Andrea maybe, everyone there is out of their freaking minds.

First you got Dale whose preferred method of dealing with conflict of any kind is brushing it under the carpet. After first taking the gun away from Andrea and then later lying about the car being fixed so they could not move on, he now, quite cleverly, decides to hide ALL guns the group owns, so Shane cant get to them; nevermind that they are surrounded by walkers. Of course Shane is the bad guy for asking him to return them.

Then you have Rick, who appears to have suspended all reason, negotiate in all seriousness with that nut job Hershel about staying on the farm indefinitely in exchange for helping him rescue Walkers. Wow. Did he really think that they could all stay on little house on the prairie with the world gone under, a myriad of unanswered questions (see CDC from season 1) and over a dozen zombies in the barn and days filled with plowing fields and rescuing Walkers here and there? Seriously? It's also only been a week or so since he awoke from his coma. Isnt it too early to settle down already and throw in the towel? Shouldnt they be looking for answers instead of wasting their time worrying about Lori's rate of sexual intercourse and status of reproductive organs?

Finally, the little boy got more dialog and screen time than TDog and Daryl has gone from the violent, yet courageous,  boondock trash who was willing to blow everyone's brains out at the drop of a hat to sentimental, mooshy and sappy around Carol, who seems a little too old for him and whom he affectionately calls a ""stupid b*tch"". Huge turn off. Calling an abused woman abusive names totally made me dislike Daryl.

Shane's character is quite interesting. He seems to have had those violent and angry tendencies all along actually, only that they were sort of kept in check under the thin veneer of civilization and the rules, laws and mores that govern it. Now, all of a sudden with all those structures, if you so will, no longer in place, those traits in him keep peaking through and manifesting. I don't think he is a sociopath or even an evil and callous person like most people here like ot say. I highly doubt that if he was in pre-zombie apocalypse world, he would have shot another human being, like he did with Otis, to save himself. But in a world that's been taken over by flesh eating zombies, the same rules don't apply anymore. They can't apply or you'll die. It was either him (and with him Carl) or Otis. Keeping your humanity is important but it can really only go so far if you want to survive. Shane's deterioration as the result of the meltdown in the world is quite interesting.

Shane is still the most reasonable if you ask me and i think Rick's behavior would have gotten them killed, but you can see his mask of sanity slowly slipping and that is intriguing. I hope the writers keep the nuances and ambiguity there instead of following some trite clichee and turn him totally evil.

One of the strength of this show was that unlike most zombie movies, this looked at the humanity of it all, portraying the fate human kind was facing as tragic, illuminating the sadness of a world torn by disease. Those scenes in the first season where Morgan's child struggles because his mother has become a Walker, when Amy turns or where they have to abandon Jim who was bitten, were beautifully executed and powerful. Amid all the insanity we were reminded that the biggest tragedy is that every single human being has been ravaged and killed by illness and reanimated into nothing but a monstrous, animated corpse forever doomed to wander the world in an undead, mindless daze in what is to be the zombie apocalypse. This dilemma was central to the story line and created an unparalleled mood and somberness. Season 2, on the other hand, let the air out slowly and painfully and now, with the exception of this a couple of episodes, it has flattened out, like Lori' s chest and personality.

This show has gone from one about survival and the adventure within an unexpectedly terrifying setting to one about the interpersonal relationships of the remaining survivors. How about those iconic shots of cities and roads that are completely empty and where the signs of the apocalypse are the only things that mar the landscape like overturned cars, wrecked buildings, fires, and dead bodies?

The aftermath of the chaos, the silence, and the blank canvas of the landscape - especially city - created a suspenseful atmosphere in the first season, drawing you in and wanting you to know more about how all this happened, what is left, where the scientific community is, how other cities and countries dealt with it etc.

I don't see this show taking on a meaningful direction, however, to parallel what we have seen in Season 1, anytime soon, if they continue on the same path writing wise. It certainly is a shame. They should never have let Darabont go.",1322438400,7,6937,4.623070674248578

I will give this show one, just one MORE episode to blow my mind, and if it doesn't it, that is it.

4818966,2,B005LAJ23A,I agree with the comments that the second season is becoming a snooze fest.  The first episode of Season 2 was promising. But it went downhill from there.  I guess all the excitement left with Frank Darabont.,1322179200,3,208,4.594594594594595

I love this episode through and through: the danger lurking in every corner, the eeriness of the deserted landscape, the road-block and the cars, the herds of zombies. The imminent danger and terror were palpable at every moment, perfectly conveying that mood of terror and desolation. The herd scene was very intense and almost difficult to watch as i felt so drawn it, it was like i was there with them, being scared to death that one of the walkers might bend down, see them and take a bite. It was pure terror. I like how the episodes (Season 1 until now) go from delightfully scary to unexpectedly terrifying about half-way through. The scene where Andrea is still in the RV playing with her gun when the walkers are right outside and the little delay until she discovers them but it is too late and she is trapped inside: perfection. So intense. I was dying watching her locked up in the small restroom and the walker right outside. If only all episodes in this season were like that.

What did bother me was all the men deciding that the little women shouldnt get any guns in a world overrun by zombies and where a walker seems to be waiting at every turn. That was ridiculous and pretty sexist and short sighted. I also couldn't believe that the kids were allowed to just roam around as they pleased and how Carl was allowed to go on the search for Sophia; in fact that entire scene where he asks for permission and Lori gets all ""cutsie"" about it  - as if she was debating whether she should let him go camping tonight and not as if she was juts about ot send her 10 year old into the woods filled with zombies - seemed ridiculous.

I did like how Andrea eventually confronted Dale and accused him of having taken away her choice to die on her terms as opposed to being torn apart by drooling freaks. I had never thought about it that way but given their predicament it did make sense and as the audience it does make you wonder what you would choose if the world had come to an end and being scared and the race to stay alive where the only things to live for. Suddenly Dale stopped looking like a hero who saved her life. It was acted very believably because you see that moment of epiphany in Dale's face where it occurs to him for the first time that what he did wasn't selfless deserving gratitude, but in fact quite selfish. That is the kind of strong dialog and exchange I expect to see throughout this season.

Altogether I think this was one bada$$ episode from start to finish and I am so disappointed that the subsequent episodes of this season have failed in that regard and that we have gone essentially from a fantastic season premiere filled with all the amazing elements that made Season 1 excel to one that looks like an empty balloon you let all the air out of and that is sort of just sitting around deflated. This is how I see the subsequent episodes anyway - especially compared to Season 1 and the Season 2 premiere.

4819019,4,B005LAJ23A,"I have enjoyed this season so far. Who wouldn't want to stay on that farm for awhile, after all they've been through? haha  I imagine they will get ""on the road"" again at some point. In the meantime, it's nice to have the encounters with walkers be more of a surprise than a regular feature. And it just makes me wonder what it IS going to take to get them moving again. And whether they'll lose any more people in that process.

I agree with some of the criticisms by other reviewers regarding ""soap opera"" story lines, but I'm giving the writers the benefit of the doubt that they will keep things interesting. They have surprised me before. And again, I am enjoying the ""breathing room"" in the action to allow for some consideration of various moral issues and some character development. Regarding the use of gender stereotypes, I'm also willing to suspend judgment and  see how it plays out as the story goes on.

Comparing what we have seen so far to the first season, something is missing and this season definitely does not measure up. Where is all the bleakness, horror and urgency that was so dominant in the first season? The desperation of the existential kind? The terror? The interpersonal struggles and drama that never got trite? The first season had a kind of sinister undertone to it. This one feels like a handful of sunshine as it is filled with episodes full of sappiness and sentimentalities and I still cannot get that touchy/feely soap opera style out of my head. This whole thing of drawing out the announcement of the pregnancy to Rick and the ""who is the father"" story line are just about two of the most tired clichees out there. They really should not be employing it in a series that set the stage for the zombie apocalypse quite beautifully. It just diminishes its quality.

Yes it is great that the question of ""should we have a child in this zombie ridden world"" is posed, but that is also where it should end, rather than turning into melodrama and venturing off into soap territory with that love triangle stuck on top of that. If this had been the same show in caliber and intensity as the first season, Lori would have kept those abortion pills in, instead of throwing them up, resulting in a miscarriage and a sad but ""this is reality"" fall out afterwards; like we saw when Amy died. This would have allowed the story to shift from the trite cliche it is now to a story line more appropriate and in better alignment with the mood this show is to convey.

Season 1 was all about survival and getting out of town, being scared all the time that a herd may pass by or a freak might attack you in the most unlikely moment; having to be on constant alert, always in panic mode and  scared of the darkness that was the unknown. It was about pure thrill and moving through this desert of the undead. Now they are all stuck on this farm succumbing to gossip, heart-ache and their personal feelings. Dont they have anything else, more urgent, to focus on, like  - I don't know -  survival and finding out what is going on in the world, rather than stick around on this farm and wonder who did whom and how Glenn feels about this girl and how her father feels about them? Blah Blah Blah...

Which brings me to my next point: are they ever going to leave this darn place? Halfway through Season 2 and it has all taken place on this farm under the ruse of looking for a little girl who is probably dead. In fact, looking for this girl seems like a very improbable and rather artificial plot element thrown in from the writers to justify staying on location for this long because there is no way that they would just stick around in one place when there are so many unanswered questions. Remember it has only been about a week since Rick woke up in that hospital. All this has caused the show to become stagnant and invoke even more of that soap opera, boring snoozefest feeling that's been gnawing on my mind. Right now the focus is shifted toward the characters' personal melodrama and the minutiae of their lives.

Moving along is very important here as it adds genuinely new elements and possibly characters to the show, ultimately enriching the experience, rather than making it feel tiresome and slow moving. Being stuck on this farm, doing an expos&eacute; on their feelings leaves them with too much time on their hands to start looking around and picking on each other; the ugliness of some personalities begin to seep through, creating drama. Being stuck on that farm is worse than working their way through the land it seems.

On a good note, I like how the writers made the only people in here who are religious fanatics of some sort (is there any other kind) also be the exact same ones who think that zombies are just misunderstood and that medical treatment would make them human again. This juxtaposition of irrationality, first with religion and then with believing that zombies are good, is pretty interesting. It is no coincidence that the same people who, contrary to evidence, think that zombies are misunderstood are also the same ones who, again contrary to evidence, are highly religious and continue to hold on to their backwards religious beliefs in a world taken down by the living dead. The analogy here is striking. I also like the level of depravity we get to see in Shane as his role manifests.

However, I think they seriously need to move on now because something else besides everyone finding out about the walkers in the barn, discussions on babies and puppy love and a showdown between the Herschels and the group has to be the highlight. I think all this is supposed to have taken place on a 3 day period, but it feels like weeks have passed; it is too slow and soapy.

I miss the freakish grimness of the beginning, the terrifying desolation as they pass through empty landscapes and roads selectively populated by zombies, the desperation of days gone by. Now all that seems replaced by old, tired stereotypes, cheesy dialogues and characters you increasingly start to dislike.",1321833600,10,5134,4.593886462882096

Season 2 is a snoozefest focused on character development and emotional drama.  ""Im pregnant don't tell"" ""You told"" ""I love you"" ""I slept with Shane"" ""You had me at hello.""  Blah blah blah. I care less and less about these characters. We are six episodes in and I dislike them all more with each passing episode.

4819022,5,B005LAJ23A,"As a huge fan of the comic book, I can definitely say that the television adaption is fantastic. Incredible cast, perfect pacing, and easily one of the best television dramas ever produced.

Coming at it from the perspective of the comic, my interests are entirely in the characters and the writing. I'm super happy that it hasn't turned into an action driven zombie gore fest. Quite frankly, zombie attacks week after week would make it lose any impact and the show would quickly degrade into writers focusing on new ways to split a zombie open. If you want that, there are dozens of zombie films you can see.

Thankfully, The Walking Dead is focusing on what it does best in its comic counterpart and that's character development and exploring what and who you/they would become in a post apocalyptic-like world. Would it be all about yourself, would you risk everything to save a little girl you only just met, would you kill yourself, would you panic and freeze up, would you become a leader, would you become a follower. Putting characters through every emotional wringer and challenge you can dream up is what makes the best story telling and in my opinion The Walking Dead is scoring super high marks.

I am also quite happy that they are letting the characters develop in unique ways that differ from the comics. The story so far is following core plot points from the comic, but as we have seen with more than one character's life and others deaths, it's not following the same fates that the printed characters have and I'm extremely thankful for that. It's successfully recapturing the joy I get from reading the comic and not knowing what is coming next and always being surprised.

Robert Kirkman is a truly one of today's best comic writers and if you are a fan of this show for the characters then do yourself a favor and buy all of the The Walking Dead comics. Then pick up Astounding Wolf-Man and Invincible both by Robert Kirkman as well. And then pick up some Alan Moore and some Brian K.

I have trouble with the silly gender politics on the show. So, Andrea shoots like a girl. Then she has sex with Shane after he teaches her to be tough.

Also, even though the morning after pill is not an ""abortion pill,"" that's what one character describes it as. Plus, Rick and his wife view the medicine with disgust (she vomits it kneeling in the dirt; he blows a gasket). If you cannot have an abortion while dodging homicidal zombies - when can you?

I am very disturbed about the prospect of a pregnant Lori. Imagine the unnecessary male heroics that will center around protecting a pregnant white woman. It's already bad enough having 5 episodes dedicated to searching for a missing white girl.  A pregnant Lori will send male paternalism into high orbit.

Also, the women on the show are behaving like stereotypes. They are all neurotic. One minute Shane has angered Andrea to the point that she runs from him. Within a few minutes, she's grabbing his crotch ready for sex. Lori wants the morning after pill so badly, that she asks Glenn to go and fetch them. Next, she is throwing them up and crying to Rick.  Glenn's sudden girlfriend goes with him to fetch the meds and then has a complete breakdown and slams the ""abortion pills"" on the table. She also goes crazy from the prospect of losing Glenn (whom she only recently met).  Glenn is trying to have a serious discussion with her and she suddenly starts kissing him passionately. Huh?

Oh, and now the old guy is jealous because he apparently could smell sex all over Shane and Andrea. Women as property. Boring.

I imagine someone high enough up on the food chain finally reviewed the season footage and had the epiphany of, ""Hey, don't people want to see zombies in a zombie show? Maybe we should give them more of that."" They almost have the rule figured out: zombies must be seen at least twice in every episode, and the first one must be seen within the first 20 minutes, minimum. This time it took until the second half hour so they're close, so close, but regardless its definite progress.

It helped that they were tackling some weighty issues in the first half: Are walkers just seriously sick people, not fully responsible for their actions? How badly does something need to be scavenged; is it worth risking somebody's life to get it? And I particularly liked that gun control and abortion were dealt with realistically and without political bias. A baby's cry could feasibly cause someone's death. That's a valid point.

Massive props to Maggie for the verbal smackdown she gave both Glenn and Lori. Why is he always receiving the suck jobs and why should other people run her errands at all? I felt like she was giving voice to a lot of viewer concerns, and frankly it was relieving. Speaking of, it was nice to see common sense showing its head once again. Notably with Shane's instructional technique and Maggie and Glenn not using it when out gathering. Yes, the term ""safe"" probably needs a fantastic redefinition nowadays. ""I thought town would be safe."" Based on what you saw in your own little town or the desecration of Atlanta? Get used to it, there is no safe. Not anymore. It's all relative now.

The show is worth watching again. It's effectively merging the graphic novels (which by the way, were not always great.

I really cant help but compare this season to the breathtaking and phenomenal season one. Whereas in Season 1 I felt that I had to suspend disbelief only minimally, I see myself having to do that now a lot. Some have already mentioned some of the inconsistencies that have overall contributed to diminishing the quality of the show.

One of course is the whole trying to pull the zombie out of the well thing. I mean first, Dale stops the other dude from drinking the water, saying it is contaminated when he finds out the zombie is in there. Then, they risk someone's life, i.e. Glenn's, to take the zombie out on grounds that leaving it there might contaminate the water? Also, while on the one hand they argue with each other about not taking unnecessary risks, here they are willing to risk one of their best men to take out a zombie that had already contaminated the well so it doesnt contaminate the well? It didn't make sense. It seemed to me that the well zombie segment was inserted in there more as a show of a cool zombie effect rather than because it really fit the story. It is as if they wanted that gory special in there and wrote the story around it.

And what is that with the church scene? I don't remember if it was in this episode or the previous one but it was one thing that truly bothered me: that whole scene where first Carol and then Grimes sit there and whine and plead, pray and sob to the cross was so sappy and tacky. Oh my god. I couldn't believe they blew so much screen time on that. I mean let's forget for a second that you would have to be seriously insane and in complete and utter denial to believe in any kind of religious stuff or divine providence when the freaking ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE has befallen the Earth, but to seriously make that one of the plot elements with the secret message being that maybe there is something divine after all, was so inappropriate for this show, not to mention sappy.

And whats up with the men all holding the weapons and determining which little woman can keep hers. That's ridiculous. They keep saying they cant have it because they have no training, but who cares? The world has come to an end for cryin' out loud;  these people live life like someone was holding a knife to their throats and they are at the risk of being attacked by an insane freak at any moment. Everyone, except the kids, needs to carry a gun and not ask for permission, especially when they are wandering through the woods filled with zombies. And then even that is obviously biased, because Lori got to have one last episode because she is Rick's wife even though she is as trained in shooting as Andrea or Carol.

Another thing that truly bothered me is how careless these people are. This is a world that has gone under and the deranged undead are lurking in every corner, and neither Lori or Carol really watch for their kids. In the first episode of the season when they were stranded on the road blocked with cars, they just wander amid the cars and Lori and Carol let the kids walk around on their own. Later when they go looking for Sophia, Carl asks if he can go stating that ""they need all the men they can get to cover as much ground as possible"". Yes, kid, all the MEN, not little boys. And then Lori actually says ""I don't know. Ask your dad, I cant always be the bad guy"" as if she was debating whether she should let her kid go to Magic Mountain instead of on a zombie hunt:  for crissake by_ch you are about to send your kid out into woods deluged by the insane undead, he isn't going to the state fair or planning to go on throw up rides. I couldn't believe they let him go. So of course when he was shot, it was hard ot feel sympathy for them -they should never have let the kid go.

Everything since they left the CDC is drawn out. I think this is all supposed to be taking place in a 48 hour period but it is so drawn out that it feels like they have been there for a week. I know they are waiting for Carl to get better too but their main mission still seems to be to find the girl and at this point it seems just a little crazy and out of touch with reality for them to be looking for a girl abandoned in the woods filled with zombies. Do they seriously think they are actually going to find her. ?

Anyway these are just a few of the inconsistencies that are starting to really bug me. Otherwise great show - even though I wish they were bringing back more of the bleakness of the first season and stopped with all the sentimentalities and sappy sub-plots.",1321747200,7,4542,4.272093023255814
4819062,2,B005LAJ23A,"The writing has taken a seriously boring turn.  None of the episodes in Season 2 speak of any urgency - to solve, to figure things out, to move forward.  The pacing is slow and all the characters' ""problems"" are getting surprisingly low stakes.

Glenn feels heartbroken after a cheap thrill?  Aren't there more important things to focus on?  Why does this take up so much reel?  And how did everyone get so comfy in the Apocalypse as to reduce their concerns to run-of-the-mill gossip matters?  Everyone really seems to be unnecessarily over-explaining their worries and moral dilemmas in this season.  Super daytime soap style.

We've been stuck at this same location, with the same dreary (almost now annoyingly dragging) issues:  Carl is healing and Sophia is STILL missing.  Is this the way it happens in the graphic novel?  The idea of being at this pit stop indefinitely with no significant character development and no action is more of a nightmare than dealing with the undead.  We haven't met any interesting people or had a worthwhile twist in plot since Shane killed Otis.

Plus, Daryl gets shot in the head from 50 yards out and is only grazed?  I can only suspend my belief so far.  So entirely over the top.  Would've been better if the bullet missed, everyone hits the ground (why did no one hit the ground with live ammo whizzing over their heads?), we see everybody give Andrea a serious piece of their mind for not following basic gun safety protocol, and then she gets her gun privileges revoked, including her precious pistol.  Now, she's gun-less in zombie land because no one trusts her to be responsible.  See???  More interesting AND realistic.

Anyway, I have mostly been DVRing this, and so i didn't buy this here, but i did think it was pretty awesome. The development of Darryl is my favorite aspect of this season so far to be sure. So, I'll keep this brief, but with spoilers, so look away, lol

When Darryl starts hallucinating, and his brother Merle is giving him flak while basically motivating him to get up and survive (D's subconscious speaking), i knew a zombie would be preparing to gnaw on him...and he was brutally efficient in handling that situation.
Also, all the zombies being kept in the barnhouse....figured that out before it happened, but it still added an element of shock to the series, much like Shane sacrificing Otis in a previous episode. Makes you stop and think about how things would really be in a zombie filled world, and how morality is subjective when the perceived extinction of mankind is eminently possible.

I haven't read the comics yet, but i did buy the first omnibus recently, and from what i understand, the series has been true to the comics, making me even more certain to read them soon, and quickly.

Of all the Living Dead movies I've seen, I think the original Night of the Living Dead and the one with the red-headed girl and her boyfriend on the motorcycle (ripped stockings and piercings) were two of the most memorable.  This shows the complexity of human emotions. In this series, I started off disliking Daryl (alleged hickbilly), but he is somewhat of a hero to me now.  He's got heart!  Shane is not all bad nor good, he's covetous and it's hard to wish him any harm in a way for loving as hard as he does.  This is an excellent series!  It's something that my son and I talk about all the time and I've gotten caught off guard quite a few times with the surprises.  I am a vampire and zombie officionada.  I recommend this series to any horror buff. Since I've been able to rent these online, I might be in trouble.

The characters (at least the male characters) are complex and the dialogue is artful. I wish there was at least one female character who wasn't perpetually the hand-wringing victim, but every scene with the character Daryl gets me riveted. The problem with this kind of story as a series for me is that I wonder how long I can suspend disbelief. Already I want to know why rotting corpses don't eventually decompose to a point of uselessness to the host virus. The zombie population should be diminishing, shouldn't it? But all that aside, exploring what the rules of survival should be after civilization crumbles is pretty good stuff.

I understand why people want to see more zombies, but I also understand why the writers are only giving us a couple at a time. If every week we watched a zombie army attack the camp we would all become numb to it and when the story called for an epic zombie bloodbath it would just be another drop in the bucket.
  The thing that surprises me the most about all of these episodes is how closely they follow the comics. I expected the writers to go where ever they wanted but they're staying pretty true to the original story. So as a fan of the comic I couldn't be happier watching the comic being brought to life for TV. Before the late 90's any comic to TV or Movie adaptation was pure garbage and rarely even attempted.

4819167,3,B005LAJ23A,"Currently we are at episode 5 of this show and I am starting to feel the chick flick/soap opera style shining through. I still absolutely love this show, I love the premise and the theme of zombies taking over: there is just something so disturbing and horrifying about zombies that vampires and werewolves don't possess. Maybe it is the fact that zombies don't have a will of their own; that they are bereft of consciousness and self-awareness, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli; maybe it is the fact that they don't seem to have a reason for being really other than feeding on the living and moving on in their brain dead daze. Whatever it is, it is more intriguing than most other horror villains.

Anyway, I still believe The Walking Dead to be one of the best out there. However, at this point, it is just not as intense and breathtaking as it used to be during Season 1. The intensity has slowed down, there are fewer and fewer ""Walkers"" around and they are focusing entirely too much on the interpersonal relationships of these people and that love triangle. One would think that in a time where the WORLD HAS COME TO AN END and its population largely replaced by the walking dead, people would start to rise above the occasion and instead of sneaking around with their only friend's wife, band together. But no, not here. Human nature seems  to show its ugly selfish face even when the world has come to an end. While in the beginning the ""we hooked up because we thought you were dead"" story line was sort of interesting, it is starting to occupy too much screen time. This is a show about the zombie apocalypse; a  show about the end of humanity and life as we know it - this isn't about grown men being driven by juvenile behavior as they fawn after the chick who rejected them and get all bitter about it during the apocalypse no less. Does it really matter when life has  become nothing but a struggle and fear that at any moment some flesh eating zombie might attack you and eat you.

I want to see them move forward, keep traveling in order to find other people, if at all, or find out more about what is going on and what has been going ever since the rise of the dead. I want to see more of the desolation, more of the destruction, more of those flashbacks about how the apocalypse and take over started; how the world ended, lives lost and turned zombie; I don't want to see them spending more and more time on this farm with the odd inhabitants. I want to see them traverse the desolation, encounter the ""herds"", struggle for their lives, try to answer some of the tough questions like that time they were at the CDC, face horrifying challenges in the face of a world gone by and taken over mostly by flesh eating freaks. I want to see the kind of intensity in acting and drama as I saw when Amy was bitten and transformed or when Grimes entered spooky and desolate Atlanta packed by hungry zombies. Bringing humanity in the equation is great - such as the time they talk about their lives before the end, when former adversaries bond, or when they reflect about their predicament as humanity has come to an end. But please no more of that chick flick type of dialogues and tired clichees of who is the father of my child and how are we feeling about this today. Urgh. In season one danger was lurking in every corner and nothing seemed safe. They were attacked left and right and good people were lost in a shocking way. Now it has all slowed down and everyone seems to have found a lasting repose on this farm.

In season 1 Rick told Dr. Jenner at the CDC that they had to go and find out what is still left and if there is more. Now he is comfortable sitting on his butt at the farm looking for a girl that's disappeared in zombie land for days now with Herschel who is less than accommodating and is pushing for them to leave already. I couldn't agree more. Get out of there.

Looking back, I want to see more of that sinister darkness so prevalent in season 1, i want to see more of the tension that is slowly built up, culminating in something horrible. Right now it all just seems too drawn out. They been on the farm for what three or four days, but it feels like they've been camping here for weeks. The zombie elements and the fact that the world has ended have become secondary and the characters are entirely too occupied with their feelings and emotions and all that sentimental crap.

One thing I hope this show will never morph into is:

+alien intervention
+government conspiracies of any kind
+a high tech underworld, or village or enclave, creating a new government that is kind of totalitarian
+soap opera type of story lines a la ""whose the father of my child"" etc.

I do hope they continue on the intense, sinister and bleak note as  - after all - this show is about the zombie apocalypse and how to survive in a world that has come to an end. For this show to be successful and stand out, it is imperative that the writers and production team do not divulge into any of the topics mentioned above and thus resort to the kinds of cliches we are all too familiar with and how somehow most shows en up these days. They also need to stop on the whiny and sentiemntal notes and melodrama and remember that this isn't 90210 with zombies thrown in.",1321228800,7,5304,4.380081300813008
4819168,2,B005LAJ23A,"Which sucks, really, that less than good has become the average for this series.

TV and comics spoilers to follow.

Yet again, I watch this show for one reason only: zombies. Here they make an appearance, but it's late in the first half, and then it's a weak attempt. I guess a stupid creature might just start gnawing at the first available limb, boot or no, but  wouldn't it naturally try different areas until it hit flesh? This one is wrestling with Daryl's boot enough to wake him before he beats it down (awesomely, side note).

After the end of the last episode I was so psyched to see Merle in action again. But then it's just a hallucination. And a two-handed one at that. That's just weak. And why wouldn't an experienced woodsman who is seriously wounded simply travel downstream instead of attempting--twice--to scale a dangerous cliff?

I get that Andrea needs a set-up to make her the wicked sniper she is in the comics. But in this particular case I can't imagine ANYONE, new to guns or not, thinking they're so cool they can shoot BETWEEN their own guys in order to take out a walker. She hit Daryl in the head as Rick and company were talking to him. So they were standing between her and the target. She shot through them, knowing a gun shot is a dinner bell, and seeing them already surround the problem. Someone needs to take that rifle and pistol whip her with it.

Herschel is upset about a missing horse? His family is keeping a horde of trouble in the barn not three hundred yards from where people are camped! And he doesn't share this? Of course people will go exploring, who wouldn't? Speaking of, wouldn't you secure some spikes in the ground surrounding your tent, or hang bells or something as an early warning system? It's not like the farm is heavily defended. Or really at all, as Andrea wasn't assigned sniper position, she just went up there on her own.

Sadly, this somewhat follows the comics. I think the difference is in comics you can imagine away anything missing from the story between the panels to justify actions. With TV you're seeing real people in these situations and you can't help but think, no wait, nobody is that dumb...

Again, sad that this series has established itself as sub par. Maybe it's a good thing that Darabont left. He certainly isn't going out on a high note.",1321228800,6,2328,4.552631578947368
4819169,5,B005LAJ23A,"It is no secret to anyone reading the reviews that this episode has caused a lot of people to be upset, but let's put things in perspective here:
1. This show is based on a comic book series, and there are LOTS of issues of the original comic that have few to no zombie encounters in them.

2. Without occasional breaks in the action, the characters have no way to be anything but one-dimensional. All we would see is people blowing up zombies and trying to survive, without even having reason to care why they should survive or not.

3. The ""moral""/survival issues faced in the show such as controlling gun use, are nothing but practical. In a zombie apocalypse, I would be more scared of my comrades if they were all untrained, armed to the teeth, and scared to death wandering through a creepy forest.

Long story short, taking away these breaks in the action would reduce this show to mindless 'night of the living dead' clones every week. If you want nonsense plots, flat characters, and action for action's sake, go watch the Resident Evil series.

The characters are developing in a wonderful way (some flashbacks in the style of LOST). To me it's not so much a series about zombies, but of family, hope, & what people choose to do when faced with life or death decisions that must be made day after day, for themselves, their family, friends, or those they have come to feel a responsibility to. It's a story about survival and the choices you have to make to do it. Excellent!

With that said, I am a bit let down by season 2 for some reason. It is still very good, but it lacks something the first season had... what?... I'm not sure. Maybe as others have mentioned... not enough ""walkers""? I actually find it strange I think that, but I believe it's true.

you don't think they should move at different speeds? Ever been on a
sidewalk? NO ONE walks at the same pace. Height, weight, purpose; they
all play in."" Good point. Why exactly would every zombie be only able to
balance and walk at a slow mosey? I get running is out, that takes much
more coordination. But a semi quick trot in pursuit of food? I'll buy
that. And some zombies aren't as motivated as others, hence some shamble
aimlessly while some explore random places.
This makes sense.

Two things that don't though. ""This is a graveyard. I don't know how I
feel about (scavenging)."" More like a battlefield and even so, you're
like the last people on earth. Afraid of a little bad PR? Get your
children, friends, and compatriots anything that helps them survive.
It's not robbing the dead. It's picking something useful up off the
sidewalk. Seriously, I rolled my eyes just hearing her say that.

Dale keeping Andrea's gun because he doesn't feel comfortable with her
having it. What? Is that even his call? You're twice as likely to shoot
it accidentally, true. However, you're hundreds of times more likely to
shoot a zombie since there are millions of them around. This is all
after they've been overrun by zombies twice, first in the woods, now by
a herd. Obviously she needs a gun. As a matter of fact, everyone needs
a weapon, even the kids, at least a knife. How can that not be obvious?
You have two trained policemen with you. Start teaching people weapons
safety.

As opposed to some others I didn't think the CGI blood was overdone,
personally. (Dressing a deer is messy, I assume dead humans are too).
Plus, honestly, sometimes I want to see the gore. The lecture on
suicide was pretty collegiate but still good to hear. Can't even say I
totally disagreed with her. The religion undertones of this episode
weren't too much in your face and they basically fit. Even the three
walkers hanging out in church: that's probably where they reanimated
after begging forgiveness, incapable of exiting, they eventually sat
down. Other zombies have been shown sitting in cars, buses, and at
home. Not really that odd.

Of course, worth about a billion bad points are (in no particular order): using ""live"" bait... to noose a walker... in a poisoned well... after literally JUST showing everyone huddled around a topographic map of the area and commenting about offshoots of the freshwater creek. Removing a  contagion from a water supply doesn't magically cure that water; it's still had a dead body in it, regardless of the fact of it being a zombie. It's a coffin martini. I wouldn't drink that water after boiling it for a week straight.

Showing off your special effects skills for no good reason is just laughable (looking your way Michael Bay). If it doesn't fit in with a logical plot all you've done is make a joke to, and really about, the audience. It was stupid to risk Glenn in an effort to save the well; go to the creek for water, or to the stocked truck Shane found like two days ago, or start digging another well, but don't risk someone's life! This isn't the desert, it's Georgia. There is water to be had. I'd want these idiots to leave too if I was Herschel.

And that's just the lowpoint of the episode. Ransacking a pharmacy by passing perfectly good houses en route made no sense either, nor did leaving the horses (again, live bait) tethered outside without a guard, nor did having two people search instead of one guarding the other's back. I watch my buddy's back in a questionable 7-11. I like to think we'd be a little smarter than the average bear during the Apocalypse.

The plot line is similiar to any zombie apocalypse movie but that isn't what makes this show. They work very hard to build up the suspense and I find myself curled up on the couch yelling ""don't do it, don't do it"" only to find that it wasn't a zombie about to eat someone after all. This show, for those who look beyond the zombie premise, will find real, deep, and well thought out moral juxtapositions and what would you do questions. The characters are well thought out and developed and it makes it really difficult at times to guess who if anyone will die and hard to ""lose"" someone. A very well thought out show.

4819322,4,B005LAJ23A,"If you're unfamiliar with the comics on which this show is based, it might be helpful to know the title could just as easily be ""Desperation"" since this whole concept is exploring the depth of humanity: how far will you go to keep your family safe, save your son, and be with your wife? What's one life worth compared with another? Whose life? What about your own? These sorts of questions are the root of the series. Obviously, any basic philosophy class deals with these issues, so to keep it interesting  to people like me zombies are thrown in there as the catalyst forcing the questions to find resolution.

In this episode we start to see some of the characters coming together into the cohesion the comics are so highly regarded for. Mainly, Shane comes into his own. It's a slow burning wick to be sure, but the payout is so, so worth it. I was definitely impressed. Rick and Lori as well, although they're a tad more relatable. Glenn, Maggie, Dale, and Andrea all turn in solid performances that build their characters and it's great to see some  teetering on the brink while others are grounded in their resolve. (Daryl is great too, but hey, it's Norman Reedus. The sky is also blue, in case obviousness isn't your strong suit.) And of course, the whole point of watching the show, the zombies that give chase to Shane and Otis are well done and convincing. The entire sequence in the high school was all around solid.

4819374,4,B005LAJ23A,"THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS****

I watch this show because I want to see zombies. I didn't see any the first half of this episode and that is a problem. A zombie show with great characters is awesome. But just a character show with some zombies thrown in isn't really worth my time. That's just regular TV and I'll eventually stop watching. Might as well be shopping at the mall to see as much social and family drama play out as the melodrama we had to wade through here.

The move from Carl getting shot to getting medical care and introducing new characters took all of ninety seconds. Well done. Most of it played out nicely between the episodes actually, and that was fine, as it moved the story right along. And then it hit a brick wall in the form of Rick's continued weird parenting decisions. Your kid needs Type A transfusions and you're the only source. Even if you could leave, why would you? Stay by the bedside in case he wakes up again. I get he's concerned and overwrought but seriously that makes no sense. Nor does Lori whining to the only medical man available, ""have you done this before?"" Does it matter? Carl is either dead or has a slight chance. So an idiot shot your son. You let your son go wander off into zombie infested woods instead of staying in a cleared area. Who, really, is the idiot here? It was a mistake to cram all of that into a single episode. Drawing it out over two or more would have been better, substituting in some flesh eaters instead.

On the other hand, I must say I like the flashbacks to the day Rick was shot. Said it before and I'll say it again, I want to see how exactly society broke down as zombies, ""the epidemic"", overtook these peoples' everyday lives. To me that's the key where TWD can distinguish itself from others in the genre. Not a small pocket of resistance (Night of the Living Dead) or well after the fact (28 Days Later); show us the play-by-play of reality crumbling into this funky new surrealism. On that note, when T-Dog saw the carseat splattered with blood, MAN, that was the most disturbing image I've seen in awhile. Speaking of him, thank you, writers, for illustrating his moniker (Theodore Douglas) and spelling out in his fever-induced delirium what we've been wondering since last season: what are the long term survival prospects for this group, anyway?

Lastly, here's a freebie of common sense. Two guys need to clear an area of walkers to search it. They drive up in a pickup. Just send one guy driving in slightly faster than a zombie can shamble to lead them away. They're not intelligent, they'll follow bait; they don't need to be tricked. Certainly two guys with no armor don't really need to risk themselves searching when one driver can just draw off the pack. It's like no one in this show has actually had a group discussion on survival techniques. Brainstorm! Instead, it always goes this way: we need something, you couple of people will go for it even though these people over here oppose the idea for sound and rational reasons. Take only one weapon each and under NO circumstances discuss the best approach to the problem on the way there--absolutely no strategy or tactics--and if at all possible leave a clear and easy trail back here for as many walkers as possible to follow you.

Notice how there isn't really any deterent to keeping them away from the farm house. That wire fence won't do much...",1319500800,4,3407,4.560457516339869

4819376,5,B005LAJ23A,"This episode specifically, like one other reviewer posted, is definitely in the top 3 of the series.  I despise the director for these unbearable cliff hangers, but each installment always delivers, so it's worth the suspense in the end.  This is definitely one series worth watching.  It's come at the perfect time to tap into the rising zombie fad as well.  The best part about the show is that the zombie apocalypse is only the setting, not the story in and of itself.  Good character development and suspense put this one, in my opinion, just a notch above Romero (be gentle).",1319414400,4,580,4.702970297029703

What a great episode.  As someone mentioned before, there was not a great deal of gore, which was ok, but the suspense was through the roof.  This show really knows how to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I will say the cliffhangers are painful.  I watched the 1st season straight through here on Amazon, and I would like to just wait out the end of this season and watch them straight through, but I don't think I have the willpower for that.

This episode is a brave triumph, setting gratuitous gore aside and leaning on the strengths of the actors. Walking Dead is maturing at a welcomed pace. If I'm not mistaken, there were no shots fired in this episode. Congrats!

I can't wait for next week because I think they'll be together and things will start moving along with them. I love the idea of happier times mixed in with such terrible (but awesome to watch) times. I also love how they end each episode with a cliffhanger. Man, I can't wait for next week! I'm really losing my mind in anticipation.

I expected more from the Season 2 premiere. For one thing, and let me say that this is true for most TV series from regular TV to Showtime, the characters are written to do stupid things in order to drive the ""drama"". What are these stupid things? One big one is letting a 10 year boy approach a deer in the wild because...?! I'm not a huge hunter type but writers, this is so stupid. Really? Another, dropping your guard just because its daylight? There are other moments in this episode, that follow this type of TV series style formula.

However, the rest of the season was good but settled into a regular level of entertainment for the show. I was seriously excpecting this premeire to be as intense and entertainging as the last but was a little disappointed. It felt like a regular episode, which is not really bad. I was just really looking forward to something more. Anyway, having said that, there are some parts to this that I feel was simply writers out of their element.

First, they seem to be falling into the trap that doomed the latest incarnation from the Stargate franchise ""Stargate: Universe"" by having secrets, problems, plot lines, and solutions to happen at a snails pace! I mean, really! Settle some of these things and move on! It should not take two seasons for Rick to find out that his wife had a relationship with his best friend! My humble advice: keep it moving and keep the story arcs simple and a little shorter.

Second, having been raised in the south and around a few baptist churches, I found it funny that they choose to place the ""spiritual confrontation"" of the group in what the sign called a ""Southern Baptist Church"" all decked out with a massive life sized crucifix! Maybe I'm the only person who laughed at that, but all the baptist churches I have ever seen never had any obviously catholic icons in them. Anyway, I did not care, it just shouted to me of writers who are out of their element when writing about southern religious imagery. Does anyone ever do research anymore?

Nevertheless, the show is awesome and I'm sure that it will be a good season. But frankly, after a long period of time to get ready for season two, you would have expected a little more fireworks!",1318809600,10,1852,4.555555555555555

Second, having been raised in the south and around a few baptist churches, I found it funny that they choose to place the ""spiritual confrontation"" of the group in what the sign called a ""Southern Baptist Church"" all decked out with a massive life sized crucifix! Maybe I'm the only person who laughed at that, but all the baptist churches I have ever seen never had any obviously catholic icons in them. Anyway, I did not care, it just shouted to me of writers who are out of their element when writing about southern religious imagery.

Nevertheless, the show is awesome and I'm sure that it will be a good season. But frankly, after a long period of time to get ready for season two, you would have expected a little more fireworks!",1318809600,8,1814,4.541284403669724
