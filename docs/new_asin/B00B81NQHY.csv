8563789,5,B00B81NQHY,"I must admit, I was pleasantly surprised at how well The Dark Dealer turned out.  Not only did it have a few genuine scares, some nudity, and some gore, it also had heart.  And I'm not talking about a bloody pulsating organ on the end of a stick, but rather the filmmakers genuinely love the genre and respect their audience.  It's evident that this flick predates cheap CGI effects and true ingenuity was needed to create some pretty cool shots.  It's a shame that the SyFy channel doesn't follow suit with it's cheesy movies and give their audience a true cinema treat and not some crummy straight to video piece of garbage.  Bravo to the Texas cast and crew that made this gem.",1377475200,4,680,4.495934959349594
