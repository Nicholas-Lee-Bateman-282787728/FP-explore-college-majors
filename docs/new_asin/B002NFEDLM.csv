8375037,5,B002NFEDLM,"This is a great DVD to own, the main roles are danced by people having a tremendously good time, Nureyev in super form, more so than any other video I've seen of him, exceptional dancing and mime.  To see him in action like this is to know why he loved being on stage.  It's really fun.  The costumes are beautiful -- this is Rome, after all.

Interestingly, Gislaine Thesmar can be seen 10 years later in the DVD Dancer's Dream, the documentary of the preparations for Nureyev's version of La Bayadere for Paris Opera Ballet, 1992.  In that footage she is discussing the fine points of poses and steps with the two etoiles who are the female leads, Elisabeth Platel and Isabel Guerin.  If you've wondered where ballerinas go when they quit dancing, the Bayadere documentary offers insight into how pros train other pros.  The Dancer's Dream series from Paris Opera Ballet is all good, in my opinion, but don't confuse the documentary with the video of the actual performance.  There are 2.  Get both.",1295740800,,1001,4.674285714285714

Nureyev is impressive and Thesmar, as usual, beautiful!",1275782400,2,112,4.947368421052632
8375039,4,B002NFEDLM,"Mazilier's choreography reconstructed by Pierre Lacotte for the Rome Opera on Daniel Auber's ballet version (1857)of his opera Marco Spada is undoubtedly vivid with various difficult steps. This may have been the reason that led Nureyev to dance the main role, having suggested it to his friend Lacotte while having dinner with him. Lacotte accepted and Marco Spada premiered in March 15,1981,with enormous success. Then it was filmed live the following January(1982)with its original cast - Nureyev and toiles Ghislaine Thesmar (Lacotte's wife)and Michal Denard. Nureyev was in his early forties and already ill but his magic dancing is still a fact, with his high jumps and turnings and Mazilier's exquisite purely classic quick steps and it is an evidence that he was enjoying every minute. Thesmar and Denard dance flawlessly,and the whole production is very good,although in a 4:3 format. A chance and a privilege to watch Nureyev's artistry in this highly enjoyable ballet. Absolutely not to miss!",1269907200,7,1003,5.314465408805032
8375040,5,B002NFEDLM,"This DVD is terrific.  Rudolf Nureyev and Ghislaine Thesmar are excellent - their dancing is superb.  Rudi obviously had a great time dancing this role, and there is a lot of difficult dancing - a lot of very different steps and combinations.  He was nearly 44 years old, yet danced as if he were 10 years younger. His acting, artistry, and musicality are fantastic. Great music; great costumes.  There are a lot of far-away camera shots; I assume because so many dancers are usually on stage.  The choreographer, Pierre Lacotte, shares special, warm memories of creating this ballet with Rudolf.  I highly recommend this.  It is a real joy.",1260057600,15,641,4.825688073394495
