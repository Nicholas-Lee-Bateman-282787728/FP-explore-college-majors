6898121,4,B00R33O65C,"The Blu-ray edition of The Long Hair of Death from Raro Video is an exceptional product. It boasts high marks for picture and sound quality while delivering a decent array of extras. The packaging is also impressive thanks to an included slip cover with original art work which differs from the art work on the cover insert. There is also a 5-page pamphlet that delves into the origins of the Italian Gothic horror yarn, complete with illustrations. Interviews with the assistant director and the writer. Two audio tracks: English (which is a pretty damn good dub)and the original in Italian. Fangoria Magazine's editor in chief Chris Alexander takes the time out to provide a video introduction to the film. The image is not letter boxed so the it takes up your whole screen. There is very good contrast and detail on display here, especially in the outdoor scenes, while the interior scenes are convincingly stark and foreboding. Close ups reveal satisfying detail and textures. If you've seen the film and are a fan of it you should purchase it immediately. If you haven't then you should rent it and see if it tickles your fancy. It certainly tickled mine.",1420848000,20,1160,4.834170854271357

8693875,5,B00R33O65C,"Barbara Steele stars in this black and white horror gothic tale of burning witches and desire to possess a woman for love's sake.
I bought this because I am a Barbara Steele fan. Have been ever since I saw ""Pit and the Pendulum"" long ago with Vincent Price.
It is exciting for us ""Steele"" fans to finally get to see her in all her glory in these HD Blu-ray movies!
The picture and sound are fantastic, probably the best this movie has ever looked, certainly.
There are several special features here also with an additional 5 page pamphlet telling you about the making of the movie, with some pictures.
No reversible graphics inside the Blu-ray, but still a worthy package all around.  The movie itself is pretty good, perhaps one of her best. The black and white really does it justice in HD.

8693878,5,B00R33O65C,"A Gothic ghost story lovingly filmed in black and white and starring Barbara Steele as Helen Rochefort and Mary the mystery woman.  The story takes place centuries ago on a feudal estate surrounded by villainy and superstition.  A man was murdered and the blame was placed on an innocent woman (Halina Zalewska as Adelle Karnstein and Lisabeth Karnstein).  The priesthood, being what it was, thought they could prove the womans innocence by burning her............and if she survived the bonfire, she was obviously saved by God and that proved her innocent.  Naturally, the poor woman went up in smoke.  She leveled a few threats first, cursing the entire locale.  DOOM.  PLAGUE!  A pox on you all!  Her eldest daughter suffers a similar fate, shoved off a cliff by a lecherous old geezer happy to become the next Count after his brother was murdered by a vicious lout (George Ardisson as Kurt Humboldt) who brags that he did it and allowed an innocent woman to burn for his crime.  So there!  Worse still, he goes after the burnt womans youngest daughter and marries her out of spite.  My, but weren't the Middle Ages fun!
Once Barbara Steele shows up as mysterious Mary things start getting interesting.  Revenge can be quite entertaining.  Loved the ending.

I watched the Italian version with English subtitles.",1454544000,5,1315,4.913636363636364

8693880,5,B00R33O65C,"During my first two years of college, I spent almost as much time at the drive-in movie theaters as I did in the classroom. I was especially fond of the double & triple horror shows which usually featured only one movie that I knew of or wanted to see and it was always the last one to be screened. This is how I came to see most of Barbara Steele's Italian Gothic horror films. I had seen BLACK SUNDAY before I started high school and was already a fan. Thanks to the drive-ins, I saw CASTLE OF BLOOD, THE HORRIBLE DR HICHCOCK, NIGHTMARE CASTLE, and TERROR CREATURES FROM THE GRAVE. I eventually saw THE GHOST on VHS but had never seen THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH or AN ANGEL FOR SATAN. I still haven't seen ANGEL but finally caught up with LONG HAIR courtesy of this Blu-Ray and it was truly a revelation. It now ranks as my favorite Steele Italian Gothic (even over BLACK SUNDAY which I always found a little too vicious but it's nothing compared to NIGHTMARE CASTLE). Second place goes to CASTLE OF TERROR. Both movies were directed by Antonio Margheriti (aka Anthony Dawson) and are more concerned with story than with sadism.

Set in the 15th century LONG HAIR tells the story of a trio of women, a mother and her two daughters, and their relationship to an aristocratic family. The mother is falsely accused of murder and burned at the stake but not before pronouncing a curse on the nobleman and his son. The elder daughter (Steele) is involved with the father and is killed by him for knowing too much. That's just the prologue! The younger daughter, still a child, is spared and allowed to grow to adulthood when she is then married to the dissolute son who actually committed the first murder. Soon a mysterious stranger (also Steele) shows up, seduces the son, and then plots with him to murder his wife. Things go as planned...or do they? The climax of the film hearkens back to the original curse. LONG HAIR has a solid storyline compared to most of Steele's movies and is aided by excellent photography and a fine music score. Both are brought out in this astonishing transfer which gives you two quality soundtracks (one in Italian w/subtitles the other in English in a quality dub). If you're like many people and have only seen Barbara Steele in BLACK SUNDAY, then this is the next Italian Gothic that you must see and you must see this version.",1450828800,6,2358,4.522248243559719
8693881,5,B00R33O65C,barbara steele at her best  barbara steele is finally getting her movies shown here uncut for the first time.  her bw movies are very well done  very  gothic and scary,1429747200,3,167,4.466666666666667
8693882,5,B00R33O65C,"Over a decade ago, I wrote a review for Amazon about a double feature DVD release by a now defunct label Midnight Choir of Director Antonio Margheriti's 'THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH' aka 'I LUNGHI CAPELLI DELLA MORTE' and Director Camillo Mastrocinque's 'AN ANGEL FOR SATAN' aka ' UN ANGELO PER SATANA'.  Each were presented in widescreen for the first time and I thought the transfer of 'LONG HAIR' was the best I had seen. Now I can eat those words for this Blu-Ray edition from Raro Video is light years ahead of that and in the best condition that the film has ever been presented for Horror fans.  For the first time , we can finally become totally engrossed in this gothic masterpiece of treachery, witchcraft, adultery,and necrophilia .  Besides the ethereal beauty of  the Queen of sixties Horror Barbara Steele, we can fully appreciate cameraman Riccardo Pallotini's hauntingly moving images and music composer Carlo Rusticelli's  classically gothic score which would be tinkered with in  Director Mario Bava's 'KILL BABY KILL' aka 'OPERAZIONE PAURA'-1966.  Screenwriters Ernesto Gastaldi and future Director Tonino Valerii give Steele one if her best dual roles and Giorgio Ardisson an extremely villainous performance as a nobleman who will stop at nothing to get his inheritance.  Euro fans will notice actor Nello Pazzafini who graced many Spaghetti Westerns and Umberto Raho who worked with Directors Federico Fellini and Dario Argento. Raro Video presents the film in its proper 1.85 ratio and for the first time we can enjoy the Italian LPCM 2.0 soundtrack with optional English Subtitles.  The English Dubbed version is also included .  Bonus features include a 10 minute interview with Margheriti's son Edoardo which takes place in the Dario Argento museum and photographed on the original dungeon set used in the film; a 6 minute interview with screenwriter Antonio Tentori who covers practically all of the directors important works ; an introduction to the movie by Fangoria Magazines Chris Alexander who really captures what the film represents and states he enjoys it better than Bava's 'BLACK SUNDAY' aka 'LA MASCHERA DEL DEMONIO' -1960 ; and separate English /Italian trailers of the film .  Included is a fully illustrated booklet written by Chris Alexander which completes this wonderful package. Released over the years in inferior transfers, fans can finally enjoy this underrated masterpiece in all of its Black and White glory.  After all these years, it emerges as Margheritis's most accomplished work and a fitting tribute to the beauty that Barbara Steele brought to Italian Horror in the Sixties.  Bravo, Raro Video.",1428105600,12,2646,5.154205607476635
