6612578,4,B00N5B5E34,"I am happy with these workouts but only after I got it did I see they have an accelerated version and now I feel like I am missing out. I want the other workouts but would need to buy over what I already own to get it. I wish they were selling the 3rd DVD, as a separate DVD instead. As for this workout, it is nice for beginners like me that have gotten out of shape and need to ease back into it. It does not make me feel like I cannot move the next day like Jillian Michael's do, yet I am feeling sore in all the right places, but still able to move and function and do another workout today.",1424304000,29,595,3.845528455284553
6612579,4,B00N5B5E34,"Thank you Affirm films for sending us the Daniel Plan In Action DVD set!

While I haven't done any serious dieting, I have tried to stay active and pay attention to what I eat.  After watching the movie Fed Up, our family has cut back on our sugar intake.  The Daniel Plan has five foundations that have a good chance of transforming your body for the better if they are in place.  These include:

Food - Eating natural food in proper proportions
Fitness - Regular workouts
Focus - Don't give up!
Friends - You have a better chance of success if you have accountability partners

Pastor Rick Warren is one of the founders of The Daniel Plan and is featured on the first DVD with his sermon of The Five Habits of Healthy People.  He goes more in depth of the five foundations and uses Bible verses like Philippians 4:13, 1 Corinthians 10:31, Romans 12:2, Ecclesiastes 4:9, and Ephesians 4:22 to back up their diet program.  While I am all for taking care of my body/temple as 1 Corinthians 6:19-20 says, I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with pastor Rick Warren that it is not a sin if you don't exercise.  Is it a good idea to exercise?  Yes, and the ones on the second disc are pretty good.

There are four exercise routines and they focus on cardio, abs, upper, and lower body.  Each session is thirty five minutes long and you're bound to break a sweat.  There are lower and higher impact workouts to follow if you need less or more of a challenge.  I must say that after completing these workouts I was feeling muscles I have long forgotten about.  You'll want to have a set of light weights handy for two of the sessions. if you don't have a set of weights available you can use a couple of cans of soup as a light weight replacement.

I enjoyed the upbeat and remixed praise songs in the background.  If you like them there is a soundtrack CD available for $9.99,  or you can buy the deluxe DVD plan that comes with it and a third workout DVD.  (I was sent the two DVD version so I cannot comment on the third disc or soundtrack).

The instructors were engaging and valued our time together without wasting much of it talking.  Although I'm Christian I'm not used to hearing ""Christianese"" while working out.  When I'm doing stretches I don't think of them as reaching out to God. Sure it's uplifting, but non-Christians may get weirded out  by these workouts.  It seemed cheesy to me; can't imagine what non-believers would think.  Jumping Jacks for Jesus anyone?

Along with the DVD came a forty day calendar with a recommended workout schedule and a downloadable Daniel Plan recipe sampler.  I tried a few of the recipes and was pleasantly surprised by their quality.  Then again they do have an award winning team who created this diet plan.

Many well-known doctors have lent their expertise in developing the meal plans and exercise routines.  Dr. Mehmet Oz is probably the most well known out of the three; I have seen Dr. Mark Hyman in the Fed Up movie, and lastly Dr. Daniel Amen has contributed with his brain science expertise.

Overall this is a nice DVD set with the recipes and workout routines that focus on key parts of your body.",1423180800,27,3161,4.502636203866432

6612581,5,B00N5B5E34,The Daniel Plan in Action comes with 2 disc dvd's. This dvd set covers everything and the workouts are short but to the point. These are very good low impact workouts without the high impact you would see in other workout dvd's. Great set of dvd's. I am happy with the set.,1486684800,,273,4.269230769230769

6612584,3,B00N5B5E34,"I enjoy the workouts, but am very disappointed that you can not purchase Disc 3 separately.  The workouts are very simple and would like more of a rigorous workout. Also there is no way the people on the video have such amazing bodies just by doing the simple 30-35 minute workout everyday.  If someone finds the third DVD sold individually please let me know.",1485388800,,360,4.609375

I'm giving it a 2 because I can't get into the 3rd disc.  It appears the disc is scratched.  Item was shipped May 2nd, requested return/replacement on June 4th.  If you have a 30 day return policy, how about 30 days from the day it arrived and not the day you sent?  We would just like the one disc replaced.

Don't make our mistake though - we did our first one by using the Accelerated workout disk 3  instead of the easier one on disk 2.  We about killed our 60-something bodies,, haha!

6612598,5,B00N5B5E34,"Well, here we have yet another fitness and diet plan system. Buy the book, try the recipes, use the fitness videos...haven't we heard all of this before?

Well, yes and no.

The Daniel Plan has similar components of other programs, but I embraced the religious and  uplifting spiritual aspects. I found The Daniel Plan in the midst of some bitter life discoveries. (More on those later.)

The Daniel Plan is different from most other plans. It's based on five habits: faith, food, fitness, focus, friends.  All the information is based on God's plan for us here on earth.  We are reminded of this periodically while following The Daniel Plan.  By using Bible verses and inspirational words, a refreshing angle is created linking exercise, diet, and social behaviors with faith.  This will not only make you slim, but it will change your life!

The diet plan part of this program has not yet been explored, but the fitness DVD's are excellent.  The first disc has an introduction and a speech outlining what you will find in The Daniel Plan.  The second disc contains four fitness work-outs.  The Christian music here is lively.  The instructors rotate, which is rare in fitness videos, but the rotation provides variety and different viewpoints.  The exercises are adaptable to any fitness level.  Both DVD's will give you effective results, in my opinion.

The Daniel Plan has truly been a blessing in my life.  God really does take care of those suffering from various life events.  My events recently were: being ignored by family members after telling them that I loved them, when attempting to discuss some important work issues my boss walked away from me, co-workers acting friendly during work but not accepting my attempts to be friends outside of work, neighbor too reserved and too busy to stop and chat, and finally, my own boyfriend (I am legally divorced now) told me I talk too much. He claimed I talk about the same things over and over and reject everyone's help.  Honestly, nobody has offered the kind of help I am seeking.

Despite my personal problems, The Daniel Plan has provided me with strong guidance and hope, and has been my ""guiding light"", so to speak.  I feel as if my only friends are those from The Daniel Plan, God, and a squirrel. (The squirrel story is a separate entry on my own website if you are interested.)

So, The Daniel Plan is wonderful and simple to use, as well as inexpensive, informative, and deeply moving.  It certainly fits in with a sensible lifestyle, and I encourage all of you to give it a try!",1444089600,,2549,4.743181818181818
6612599,1,B00N5B5E34,The DVD's on the next level (intermediate) are not working at all.  I had to stop the routine and start a new exercise routine.  It was a waste of money because I was unable to complete the program.,1444089600,,198,4.184210526315789

6612604,4,B00N5B5E34,"i am not religious and have no idea who these people are, but i saw this had different levels and looked like something worth trying. it's not bad. if you're not religious it won't bother you too much - they keep the talk mainly focused on the exercises and the background music is soft and quiet compared to the instructors. i liked the multiple instructors, each of whom was doing a different level - i follow the asian girl at the lowest level. the workouts are a brisk 30 minutes, perfect for daily use and i enjoyed the weightlifting portion too. this is a medium DVD - not for beginners and certainly not for advanced. i am a Leslie Sansone fanatic, and if you can do her workouts this would be a nice supplement; almost all the moves she does, they also do",1432339200,3,763,4.3426573426573425

6612608,5,B00N5B5E34,Love this program!  Great exercise routines you can fit into a busy schedule.  Great inspiration from scriptures for exercising and taking care of your body.  Anyone can do this with the variety they give you with the moves to stay at the base move or take it up a notch if you have more energy and or strength to give it.  they even provide you with a calendar to tell you what exercise to do each day or i guess you could mix it up on your own.  Exercising as a way to take care of your body and honoring God at the same time is very motivating!,1430956800,6,547,4.027777777777778
