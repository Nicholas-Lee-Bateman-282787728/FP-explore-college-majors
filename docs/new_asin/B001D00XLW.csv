8290567,5,B001D00XLW,"I think Rojo was unique. The music was very modern, lyrics simple, voices blended perfectly, impeccable performance. So sorry I never saw them live. You still see the singers ( well, the lead male vocal is an outstanding bass player , too) performing with other, newer groups. Get the lyrics online, watch the DVD, see what you think. I think they are great performers and artists, and great worship leaders. If No Me Soltaras doesn't  get you directly in your heart, watch Matt Redman do it on Youtube ( You Never Let Go- Matt wrote it ).",1427500800,,539,4.556701030927835
