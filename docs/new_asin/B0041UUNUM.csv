4246591,4,B0041UUNUM,"I wasn't too sure about this reboot of the Giant Shark franchise when I saw it at my local Redbox. The original Giant Shark (where the titular hero faces off against Giant Octopus) is one of my all-time favorite classics, plus it's a little risky to reboot a franchise so young. So you can't believe my joy when I watched the movie and was immediately thrilled! This fast-paced adventure takes you from the Congo to Florida to California to the Panama Canal as an enormous crocodile threatens mankind, our only hope being Mega Shark. Will he win the battle? We better hope as mankinds survival depends on it!

First, let me begin with the most important member of this cast next to the Giant Shark himself: Jaleel White. I have been a fan of his since his underdog role of Steve Urkel in the under appreciated family drama, Family Matters.  It was nice to see him rise to the occasion after a terrible tragedy brings him into a cadre of unpaid, unsung heroes.  I don't want to give too much away but the chemistry he had with Gary Stretch and Sarah Lieving is definately one all screenplay writers and actors should pause and take note of.

Second, the special effects....wow. You'd think The Global Asylum went back in time and actually pulled a megalodon from the Oligocenic period to face off against one of the real life 1,500 foot crocodiles that live in the Congo! If anyone's planning to go down to the Democratic Republic of the Congo to dig for diamonds, you may just want to watch this movie first because it will change your mind!

Finally, the bad. I hate To-Be-Continued endings and this movie ends on a very mysterious note. I don't want to ruin it for anybody, but I sure hope they have a master plan for the return of Mega Shark in the sequel. If George Lucas had done the Star Wars reboot the same way Asylum handled Mega Shark, there'd probably be more Star Wars movies. But with Asylum backing up the Mega Sharkverse, I'm sure we'll have years of Megalodon Masterpieces to come!",1294099200,2,1997,4.536111111111111
4246592,3,B0041UUNUM,"Ah another cataclysmic clash of the titans from our old pals at ""the Asylum."" An almost direct sequel to the immortal Mega-Shark Versus Giant Octopus (No Deborah Gibson this go-round), Mega-shark versus Crocosaurus builds itself up to be one of those old time monster vs. monster vs. Earth movies from years gone by. Much like its predecessors (Godzilla vs. King Kong or Wolf-man vs. Dracula) the movie shies away from giving a truly definitive victor. The 3-star review I award is based on comparison with other Asylum movies as they truly are an art-form onto themselves. For an Asylum movie this one is pretty good. Long looks at the title creature-stars, decent performances from the cast,and the usual goofiness from extremely loose scripting and general absurdity. So three stars it is. Here's hoping that the end of credits scene might lead to another Mega-shark sequel.",1293494400,3,877,5.055172413793104
4246593,3,B0041UUNUM,"I consider myself an avid fan of the B movie creature feature genre; I own many titles mostly with aquatic monsters in them. I thoroughly enjoyed MSvsGO as the plane scene alone made it a gem but I found myself looking for something else to do while this movie was playing; in my case work. Now I like my job but usually not enough to spend an extra hour and a half going over things to improve in the office while I'm at home. The actors in the movie did a great job; I especially liked Jaleel White for nostalgia reasons (who didn't watch Family Matters while growing up?). However, as stated in a previous review there was plenty of camera time spent on just characters talking about subjects that had nothing to do with the plot. The increased screen time for the monsters was a big plus but it looked like they replayed a fight scene where Crocosaurus grabs the Megaladon by its pectoral several times. I'm hoping that when I watch 2010: Moby Dick this weekend I feel a bit more satisfied. All in all it delivered the match-up it proposed but I think I'll watch Dinocroc or Supergator yet again before I do this.",1293408000,2,1117,4.400966183574879

4246595,4,B0041UUNUM,"So, there I was, searching the net for a new b ( or maybe z...) movie to give me entertainment for and hour and half. Then,  by some stroke of luck, I found the sequel to last years unofficial movie of the year MEGA SHARK VS GIANT OCTOPUS. What better creaturer c to do battle with the mega shark next than a crocosaurus? And there we have it: MEGA SHARK VS CROCOSAURUS. I imediatly went onto amazon.com to pre-order my copy. And today was the day that it arrived!

As previously stated, our mega shark has apparently survived the fight with the giant octopus. We get a new team of people- including erkel- that plan on killing both the surviving mega shark and the new crocosaurus. Caos ensuses as each of there plans fails causing more and more destruction. So what's on the menu for our two creatures? Well, our mega shark still has a taste for battle ships and submarines, but not so much for planes or bridges anymore. Our crocosaurus on the other hand has a craving for African workers, killer whales, and variouse other morsels. So let's get the breakdown on msvc:

THE GOOD:
- one of my only problems with msvgo was the fact that we never got to see much of our mega shark and giant octopus. They also didn't look terribly realistic, but I didn't find that to be a problem. This time around, the effects are improved ( although still terrible, this adds to the entertainment!) and we get a lot more shots of our creatures and a lot more action.
- another improvement from msvgo is the actual fight scenes. We get two main fights between our Mega shark and our crocosaurus. They also don't consist of the same shot repeated over and over like msvgo!
- the production values also look pretty good for an asylum film, which are usually restricted to one interior of a ship being used for multiple ships and submarines. ( yes I'm looking at you msvgo!)
- the acting is pretty good for this type of movie, and so is the dialogue- lol moments with the dialogue are kept to a minimum. However that's both a good and a bad thing ( see the bad).

THE BAD:
- the main thing that kept MEGA SHARK VS CROCOSAURUS from getting a five like msvgo was the lack of fun. There was a sense of fun in msvgo that kept you entertained. You could tell the cast was having fun and not taking the movie seriously, were as the cast in this one have. It's just a bit serious sometimes, and you just want something really silly to break the seriousness.
-I missed the over-the-top dialogue from msvgo, this is what made it so hilarious! However, the dialogue in this one isntnso dramatic and over done ( which most people would consider good lol, but I found it to be a lot less funny to watch)
- also, there are some scenes in the movie were everyone was just talking, and nothing much was going on.
- the last thing I can remember that annoyed me was that it didn't try to top the plane-eating scene from msvgo! Compared to the destruction of the creatures in the first movies, these ones seem a bit people friendly. ( keep in mind that most of these complaints are miner and I dint mean to be nit- picking !)

Overall, if you enjoyed mega shark vs giant octopus then you will like this! It keeps you entertained most of the time, especially the last half an hour. Have fun viewing MEGA SHARK VS CROCOSAURUS, and I hope the asylum makes more mega- giant- saurus movies in the future!!!",1293062400,26,3366,4.362041467304625

4246627,3,B0041UUNUM,"MEGA SHARK VERSUS CROCOSAURUS

Since I am a big Asylum fan and reviewed the first film in this franchise [Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus] I decided I needed to get to the other films in it. So first up was the first sequel which had our surviving Shark from the first going up against a very large crocodile. When you have these two very large guys going at it how could it not be good.

Deep in Africa [I think] a diamond mine has troubles as its workers are eaten by a huge croc. So a hunter goes to work as this would be his prize catch. After somehow being successful he gets it onto a ship and off they go. But shortly after it escapes and makes its way into the ocean while another creature swims about. The Mega Shark from the first attacks a ship elsewhere so the military has to catch this thing. But once it is known that there are two insane huge killers out there what are the humans to do. So the battle is set, shark against croc, and both against us.

This film is just as bad as the first one which is of course what an Asylum movie is usually about. The story is crazy which is fun and the graphics are what you would expect. The acting for the most part are bad but it was cool seeing Jaeel White. The writers for this film have worked on other Asylum flicks as has the director Christopher Ray. In fact he directed other shark films for Asylum like Shark Week and 2 Headed Shark Attack.

This was as good or as bad as the first depending on your style or mood. The title says it all so you know what you are getting into. But as it turns out this would not be the last time we would see a Mega Shark. And much like Godzilla would see a robotic version of himself so would Mega, that's right, a Mecha Shark.",1406073600,,1726,4.0825958702064895

I hate to admit it but Mega Shark vs. Giant Octopus was a guilty pleasure of mine when I viewed it. Despite its' way out there premise and the fact that it was downright silly-cheesy and outrageous, I enjoyed the heck out of it. So, when I heard of the sequel to it, I thought to myself that it could only get better, right? Well, for the most part, Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus didn't fail to disappoint. It's just as outrageous, silly, cheesy & fun to watch as its' predecessor..if not more so. I thought it was pretty cool getting to see Jaleel White in a more serious(despite the plot) role than isn't him playing Urkel. My biggest gripe with the movie, as with some others The Asylum has produced, is you don't have time enough with the characters to invest in them. By the time this one got started good, it was over. Still, I loved it, though. You have to hand it to Tiny Juggernaut, who provided the  CGI...they did an outstanding job. I'm inclined to agree with Ray Boucher in his review that, given a better budget, Tiny Juggernaut could be the next ILM or WETA. I've seen Tiny Juggernaut do great things on the most miniscule of budgets for The Asylum. I've said it before & I'll say it again--I see a time when people are going to look at The Asylum as a legitimate film company...and the same will apply to Tiny Juggernaut.

At any rate, Mega Shark vs. Crocosaurus rocks. I like it & hope The Asylum comes out with another sequel. It was money well spent.",1374192000,,1712,4.495176848874598
4246633,3,B0041UUNUM,This is a b-movie sequel to Mega Shark Vs Giant Octopuss. The special effects are bad. Sarah Lieving as Agent Hutchinson is the highlight. Plenty of action and some comedy.,1373932800,,172,4.766666666666667
4246634,3,B0041UUNUM,"I somehow missed this one at the theater  (darn!) and its initial DVD release (Darn! Darn!) but I finally got to watch it as a reprieve from the computer work I do. Within minutes, I was nearly insensate with laughter.  Wasn't Jaleel White some sort of nerd named Urkel in the past? Anyways, the breakout of the crocodile thing was nowhere near as amusing as MegaShark somehow sinking a cruiser. (More on that in a moment.) One of the things I often do with movies like these is count the number of dead (because concentrating on the illogic of the film would spoil the fun) but when the humans die a ship at a time, it is hard to do this so I decided to poke fun at the alleged size of both of these monsters.

MegaShark is first. While the people in the film call it a Megalodon, the largest estimated size of such a creature that I found was 67 feet and about 114 tons. That is hardly enough size to swallow a nuclear submarine or treat another as a stick fetched by a dog. A modern day US Submarine is about 570 feet in length so at minimum (for sake of argument) the Megalodon would need to be about ten times its largest estimated size and if you do a proportional weight increase, it would mass about 1140 tons (A Blue Whale would be about 100 feet long and weigh about 190 tons). Even at that size, it would be hard for MegaShark to actually sink a cruiser and as tough as its skin is supposed to be, it would be no match for Armor Piercing ordnance. The Cruiser barrage would have at least ripped its dorsal fin to shreds. Swallowing a nuclear submarine would have killed the shark once the reactor on the sub was breached.

Now for Crocosaurus (as equally ridiculous if not more so.) It is regarded as a pissed off 1500 foot long monster (How did someone measure it?) but the largest crocodile like creature I could find was Sarcosuchus at ca. 38 feet and ca. 9 tons. Once more some extrapolation is needed. If we round up the 38 feet to 40 feet, you then need a crocodile 37.5 times larger than Sarcosuchus (40 * 37.5 = 1500) and with a proportional increase in weight (37.5 * 9 tons = ca. 337 tons). How exactly would these two monster sized schlock creations survive? I suppose Crocosaurus could travel around on land and chow down on humans but MegaShark would be in trouble considering its size...after all, there are only so many ships in the ocean.

SyFy Channel schlock is so bad it is actually worth watching for its humor value but don't expect any actual acting, even passable dialogue (let alone something better than that) or logic to be present. Instead, you should be thankful you aren't an actor who has fallen from grace and forced to be in movies such as this. 3 Stars for delightfully schlocky content!!!!",1368230400,,2734,4.384615384615385

4246646,1,B0041UUNUM,"Going by the title, I decided to watch this flick thinking it would be good for a laugh. The only shot I saw that did make me laugh was the first shot of the gigantic shark's fin as it passed the ship. It wasn't well rendered which made it more laughable. I'm amazed that someone thought this film was good enough to produce and feed to the public. The lead actor was terrible, way too hyped up and over-the-top, like maybe he'd consumed a dozen Red Bull drinks all at once. The CG effects were 2nd or 3rd rate at best. After the first 15 or so minutes of viewing, I started skipping ahead until I arrived at the end sequence, for the final battle between the shark and croc.

The title tells you everything you need to know about the plot.

The CGI effects are laughable. Grade B films of the 70s-80s look realistic by comparison. The story is barely interesting.

On the positive side, they assembled a good cast, led by the always-likable Jaleel White (aka Urkel), Gary Stretch, Sarah Lieving and the guy who played The Doctor on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-Voyager-Seasons-1-7/dp/B00062IDDS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek Voyager: Seasons 1-7</a>. They all take the material seriously and you have to respect them for not cracking up.

Urkel, an action-hero? Yes, and he works just fine, thank you. Meanwhile Stretch is reminiscent of Pierce Brosnan. As for Sarah Lieving, although she plays a dead-serious Federal agent here, she's almost worth the price of admission, almost.

The film runs 88 minutes.

BOTTOM LINE: Unlike, say, ""Octopus"" this one doesn't deliver the goods, but it might be worth some laughs with friends. Thankfully, the likable cast tries to make up for a bad film (notice I said ""tries"").

Look, you know what it is.  You also know your capacity for such things.  Obviously there's a market for these CGI modern giant creature films - of which I'm surely a part - since it seems as if they've been popping up all over.  And apparently the formula is very similar in each - take the monsters mentioned in the title, combine a pop culture icon from the 80's, go with a completely over-the-top script that maximizes the destruction without taking any time whatsoever to conform to the laws of physics, and bingo - there's your movie.

No it will not.  You either see MEGA SHARK VERSUS CROCOSAURUS and think 'what a crock', or you think 'what a crock...of pure awesomeness!'

4246654,2,B0041UUNUM,"""Mega Shark. vs. Crocosaurus"" is yet another aquatic nightmare starring people you vaguely remember from the semi-distant past. This one is a buffet of bad accents, bad acting, terrible special effects, and howlingly poor dialogue. I'm certain you're surprised. Among the chief problems is the lack of a thespian of Debbie Gibson's or Lorenzo Lamas' stature, settling instead for Jaleel White. If you're wondering where you know that name from, he is of course the most remembered star of ""Family Matters"" where he played Steve Urkel. Now imagine Urkel is all grown up and is a naval officer knowledgeable about destroying giant underwater creatures. My favorite thing about this casting lunacy is White's seeming inability to consistently call his underwater apparatus either ""hydrosonic spheres"" or ""hydroponic spheres."" (At least that's the way I heard it.) These same spheres also are central to some exceedingly well-crafted dialogue such as ""I suggest you bring your hydrosonic balls with you...."" (Groan.)

This is probably the worst of the giant ocean creatures series, although it has several moments of levity. I was particularly amused when they created an ""arc flash"" of electricity using the Turkey Point Nuclear Power Plant, but nothing prepared me for the horror of the Orange Bowl being brutally attacked or the crocosaurus laying eggs all over the place. (They are highly realistic; to me they looked like Pee-Wee Herman's rubber band ball.) The decision is made to lure both creatures to the Panama Canal and entrap them, though the plan is constantly akimbo and they end up in Hawaii luring them into a volcano and making it explode via the help of an epic battle and an ingested nuclear submarine. Throughout the picture annoying Agent Hutchinson (Sarah Lieving) is unlikable to the point you wish she'd get eaten first. In the end though, she is the pilot of the helicopter taking the cast to their rendezvous with fate. Despite having the helicopter crash in the water, she (somehow, while offscreen) repairs the chopper to rescue our heroes.

Most sane people who watch a movie like this expect it to be bad in a comic-relief kind of way. There is some of that, but it's mostly just eye-rolling drudgery. It does have extras such as a ""making of"" feature and bloopers, and they were more entertaining than the film itself by a wide margin. (Note: that's not as much of an endorsement as it may at first appear to be.)

If you want a cheesy giant water creature movie, I'd stick with quality entertainment starring Lorenzo Lamas, Tiffany, or Debbie Gibson if I were you.",1310947200,3,2592,4.967741935483871
4246655,1,B0041UUNUM,"As a disclaimer, I purchased this DVD because it looked like it could be horrible-- possibly resulting in over an hour of fun for late-night viewing.  You never know when you might find another ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Attack-of-the-Killer-Tomatoes-25th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0000B1OEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Attack of the Killer Tomatoes - 25th Anniversary Edition</a>"" or another terrible monster movie like ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cloverfield/dp/B0014Z4OQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cloverfield</a>"" that has you shaking your head in disgust right before you call your friends over to watch it again (you know...the joy of pointing out flaws and absurdities).
Well, I can now say after watching ""Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus"" that I have a new ""worst movie ever watched"" winner.  This one takes film-making to whole new lows.  Unlike the above-mentioned Killer Tomatoes, this one seems to want to be taken seriously, and unlike Cloverfield, the special effects do nothing to soup-up the badness.
The opening scenes where our monsters are introduced feature some guys supposedly mining in what looks like a hole in the dirt, and out pops Crocosaurus to smash them.  Then you have a horribly acted scientist on a military ship that looks at a computer screen running Windows Media Player visualizations and declares that the giant shark ""is back!"" Nobody believes him until Mega Shark jumps over their ship, swats it with his mega tail a couple times, creating digital explosions worthy of Crayola, and sinks the vessel.  Our hero (like the Croc expert later in the movie) is the survivor of the destroyed ship, but somehow finds himself back on land after being stranded in the ocean-- we are to assume that these guys are VERY good swimmers.
And thus begins the tale of two monsters, including a large crocodile that somehow loves to swim around in the ocean, who are really pissed at each other because when they aren't busy destroying stuff, the croc magically manages to lay thousands of eggs in the oceans of the world.  Yes, within a day, they've traveled from Africa to Miami, and Panama, and Hawaii nipping at each others' tales while a crack team of idiot humans manages to follow them half-way around the world in a helicopter.
Hmm, the dialogue...it's pretty horrible.  ""They've destroyed Panama!""  The worst is the female special agent who runs around in a business suit threatening people in the beginning, ending every line she speaks with ""dammit"" for extra intensity. Later, she sheds her suit jacket on the beach so that she can march into a cave with a flashlight and pistol whilst looking for huge eggs. She abandons the jacket there so that she can spend the rest of the movie in her spaghetti-strap tank-top because they didn't want to waste such a fine figure by having her in a suit the whole time.  Plus, we have to love a woman who lives through crashing her helicopter on the beach (which causes the above-mentioned scientist to cry like a child because he can't remember that this agent isn't his dead fiance), then magically comes back in the same helicopter for the closing scene to declare something like, ""we did it, dammit"".
Special effects?  Wow.  I don't know what to say.  The monsters seem to change their dimensions a lot, depending on where they are.  The shark manages to swallow and entire submarine in one shot.  And though the croc in some places is supposed to be just as large as the shark, still manages to hide in a small pond where a lady manages to step on its snout without noticing until it raises its huge head.  The computer generated splashes and explosions are horrible, the tanks and airplanes look like their were made by Hot Wheels and we have a terrible scene where a nuclear power plant shoots out lighting bolts to scare away the croc who is storming Miami many miles away.  Basically, the best special effects associated with this movie are on the DVD cover art.
We all expect to take a leap of faith and put reality aside when watching stuff like this, but when your intelligence is insulted to this degree at a nonstop pace, all while the folks in the movie hold straight faces and there are no obvious attempts at humor, it's hard to take. Sure, you can laugh when our two male leads are dropped off on a beach yelling, ""We've got to end this!"" then run around in slow motion holding guns (though there is nothing they could possibly do there, and tanks haven't taken out these creatures, so what can they do with a gun?), or you can laugh at the stock footage we see several times of fighter jets firing missiles that manage to pepper every building on land, but never hit a shark the side of a battleship, or you can laugh at the brilliant conclusion to lure the beasts to an underwater volcano so our scientist can pull out his detonator and make the volcano explode (don't most marine biologists carry around volcano detonators?)...but in the end, you can't help but ask yourself the question, ""why did I watch this????""",1306972800,3,5087,4.995271867612293

4246657,2,B0041UUNUM,"Imagine a world where Steve Urkel gained a lot of weight and became a Navy Lieutenant.  Imagine a world where gigantic fish that dwarf ultralarge-category container ships are able to defy physics and flip like dolphins many hundreds of feet into the air.  Imagine a world where buxom magazine models are helicopter piloting Secret Service agents who speak bad Portuguese and condemn the acts of prehistoric animals as threats to ""National Security.""  If you can get a grasp on all that, you'll start to get a vague idea of the amount of disbelief one has to suspend in order to follow this rather bizarre sequel to Mega Shark vs Giant Octopus.

Some of the movie's highlights include the worst attempt at an Australian accent I've ever heard, a wonderful scene where one of the heroes puts a giant gun to a tiny child's head, and all the improbably cute girls playing serious military types.  Look, I'm no stranger to bad movies, I know the score.  I didn't go into this movie expecting anything resembling reality.  All this stuff is just fine with me.
Unfortunately, there just isn't much to recommend this one on.  Mega Shark vs Crocosaurus is seriously lacking in the fun department.  Everything is played too straight for it's own good.  The plot is mush, the acting is terrible across the board, and the monsters are beyond absurd.  To his credit, Jaleel White is clearly the actor who tried the hardest with his performance, but even then it's kinda bad.  Who thought they were making a real film here?

The action tries to carry the movie, but even the explosions and giant creatures fail to generate much interest.  This picture offers the quality of effects you'd expect from The Asylum, mostly Freshman level ""Intro To CG 101"" style rendering carelessly layered over real footage.  Of course, the audience doesn't expect realism from a film like this, but that's no excuse not to try.  The titular monsters seem to undergo bizarre size transformations, shrinking and growing depending on what the scene asks of them, and even things like passing birds and images of footprints are cartoony and obvious with their soft, hazy textures.  Oddly enough the cinematography is pretty good, the scenes and actors are lit and filmed in an almost professional manner.  They must have some pricey cameras down there at the Asylum studios.

The laughs are what I'm missing.  Unlike Alien 3000 or Asylum's ""mock-buster"" Mega Piranha, there just isn't anything overtly funny about MSVC.  The only humor I found was in the inanity of some of the characters and writing.  Ultimately, despite the size of the movie's stars, the scope of the premise and the best efforts of Mr. Jaleel ""Don't call me Steve"" White, Megashark vs Crocosaurus is pretty forgettable.

Anyway, where was Lorenzo Freaking Lamas?",1304467200,2,2797,4.89171974522293
4246658,1,B0041UUNUM,"My 8-yr. old son rented this DVD, with my (unwitting) wife's permission. We watched it to the bitter end (I didn't want to crush my son's feelings).

This was the single-most awful movie-watching experience I have ever had; I had to bite my lip to keep from constantly laughing.

The script, the special effects, the action, the acting, the dialogue (I could go on) were about as bottom-of-the-barrel as you can get.

Watching this movie made me think back on other movies that I thought were crap; this movie makes one realize how bad ""bad"" can really be.

If more than 50,000 was spent making this movie I'd be in shock.

The characters went from Africa to Miami, then Orlando, then Aruba, Hawaii, etc. as if they were hop-scotching on sidewalk sections (do the directors understand the concept of geography).

4246659,2,B0041UUNUM,"Live action and cartoon...well, it worked for Roger Rabbit!  In this case, however, the cartoons are just too big and too silly to gain even a respectable level of amusement.  Much as I enjoy giant creatures rampaging and swimming amuck, in this case not even a bare requirement of chuckles was provided (though plenty of lunacy was!).  It's amazing that the entire cast managed to play their scenes with straight faces.  For that alone they deserve some credit.  It's not a feat I could muster without constantly cracking up.  All that forced urgency, the heightened sense of impending DOOM, the scowling, the grim determined need for duty, honor, and country!  MMMM-yeah.

Having never watched the first film, and after this I won't bother, all I can say about this sequel, on its own merits...I watched it unflinchingly (much as you would any train wreck).  You can't make sense of movies like this; they belong in a category without distinction: they are what they are.  They're like ugly puppies.  Yes, they're ugly.  But they're puppies.  Not even the novelty casting of former child star Jaleel White could help this epic of mass proportions.  I can't even begin to speculate as to why Robert Picardo agreed to lend his talents to this dubious project.

4246660,2,B0041UUNUM,"""Mega Shark versus Crocosaurus"" was a disappointment.  I enjoy cheesy movies, bad movies, but not boring movies.  This movie did not fulfill any of its potential.

(1) Characters - Too many characters, not enough script.  This movie had three major characters.  Or was it four?  Crocodile Dundee, Navy Tech, Navy Captain, and Special Agent Woman.  No significant screen time or development was given to any of the characters.  Only Jaleel White showed any range in acting.  This script needed more dialogue, more interaction, more anything.

(2) Monsters - I buy the DVD to see monsters, and the Mega Shark is mostly fin?  The Crocosaurus is, well, a huge crocodile.  And both are mostly blips on the radar screen.  Yawn . . .

(3) Suspense - Absolutely none.  The main characters were never in any danger.  I never cared what destruction the fin and the crocodile's feet waged upon the world.  No twists, no surprises, nothing unusual.  Again . . . yawn.

Two stars for having amusing moments, some slightly interesting characters.",1301529600,3,1032,4.9298245614035086

Anyway, I was really impressed by the giant crocodile in this movie. It looks great even though it's CGI and it causes a lot of destruction, even destroying buildings. The shark didn't impress me that much, though. It doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, and it just didn't look great to me.

4246665,3,B0041UUNUM,"The crew at ""The Asylum"" are notorious for making preposterous, ham-handed knockoffs of popular movies.  I.E. ""Transformers"" becomes ""Transmorphers"" - if they were ever to get into the candy market, I'm sure we would see ""N&N's"" and ""Buttertoes"".  That being said, The ""Mega Shark"" series is enjoyable on a very strange level.  The first one, ""Mega Shark VS Giant Octopus"" was just so laughably bad you had to see it to believe it.  Online hype based on the title alone gave that movie a life of its own.  The sequel, ""Mega Shark VS Crocosaurus"" sucks just as bad, if not worse, but if you love terrible grade-Z direct to DVD titles featuring giant monsters and former child stars, this one is for you.  While the original gave us former 80's pop icon Deborah ""Debbie"" Gibson in the lead, this one gives us Jaleel ""Steve Urkel"" White.  Massive shark fights Ginormous Crocodile in this outing.  With bad CG all the way 'round.  The computer animation looks like something from a PS2 cutscene.  The biggest problem I have with all these movies (and keep in mind, I buy them and enjoy them, so by saying I have a problem with them is kind of a double-edged sword) is that The Asylum doesn't seem to be willing to pump enough money into their productions to give a more substantial payoff.  Tiny Juggernaut, the company that provides the CG for the ""Mega"" series, appears to be very capable.  These guys could be ILM or WETA if they were given a budget bigger than what is usually earmarked for the dinner at a typical high-school prom.  The effects budget is the only thing that suffers from these movies.  We expect the concept to be B, we expect the writing to be B, but the end result would be better if the effects were A.  Surprisingly, the movies are shot very well and some of the vistas in the on-location stuff is just beautiful.  As tongue-in-cheek as this kind of movie is, maybe they expect the audience to be more forgiving because of the ""bad"" effects.  I say give Tiny Juggernaut more money, and in ""Mega Shark 3"", The Asylum can have the next ""Cloverfield"" on their hands.",1294185600,9,2085,4.561827956989247

The X-Ray Trivia is (as usual) filled with all kinds of spoilers designed to ruin the movie for you.
example ""There are no Battleships in any Navy today. Not even the USN.""
No, there aren't. Which is why the ship we see sunk by Megashark in the opening sequence isn't a Battleship. It is an Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate. (look up a photo of one sometime).

Another example ""no Megalodon or Crocodilian could grow to the size we see depicted in these movies,""
Probably correct. Did anyone mention the movie is fiction and not a nature documentary?

Another ""Nuclear Reactors cannot create a nuclear explosion"". We know that. But they CAN explode and fling radiation all over the place which makes the difference of interest only to Physicists.
The special effects aren't great some say.
No, This movie was made for the SyFy channel at a bargain basement price. They aren't the worst FX you'll ever see either.

For the rest: Sarah Lieving is great as always.  Jaleel carries off his role quite well. The Pound Shop Pierce Brosnan (Gary Stretch) is sexy and enjoyable.
