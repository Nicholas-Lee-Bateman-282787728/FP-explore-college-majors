7011022,4,B00TJ61H9O,Not a bad TV disaster movie. Story line was okay and the effects were quite good for a TV disaster movie. Nice and very interesting movie that will hold your interest to the credits roll across your screen. This is a movie you may watch again and again. This is a very good and creative movie to watch with the family or friends.,1434153600,5,329,4.238095238095238

7011024,2,B00TJ61H9O,"Everything about this movie was lightweight--plot, acting, special effects, etc. Plot was predicable except the ending which was weird.",1433894400,,135,6.157894736842105

7011026,2,B00TJ61H9O,"This movie had a lot going for it as far as interesting characters, scenery and lots of exciting action, but the story line was very flawed-- too bad they didn't have some better editing.  The main character who had her life work destroyed by the evil business manager seemed pretty impervious to any feeling of guilt about the massive destruction and loss of life and property that her invention caused.  Granted she didn't want her invention tested prematurely but there were no controls in place to prevent the awful fiasco the business manager caused with the wimpy 2nd in command who couldn't say no to pressure from the villain to do the thing he knew was extremely dangerous..  I can enjoy some pretty far-fetched plots as long as you can like and admire the main character(s).  But the rapid ending without really tying up the details and the cheerful indifference of the inventor makes her come across as a sociopath.  You can't have your main character being largely responsible for the disaster and have any sympathy for her.  Therefore you can't view an unsympathetic character as a hero when she indirectly caused the catastrophe.",1433548800,4,1143,4.865979381443299

7011028,3,B00TJ61H9O,The special effects were alright the cast perfect  but it could of been A hole lot better you have the creator of this energy plant who has trouble with the head of the project who wants to go live right away because of some shadow investors and she has to deal with A teenage daughter she hasn't seen for A  while which turns into A disaster. like I said to much drama.,1432598400,2,370,4.125

7011036,1,B00TJ61H9O,"This movie wastes so much time proving that teenaged girls can be unpleasant that there's very little time left for the disaster. It's mostly mother-daughter bonding, and since practically all the disaster happens conveniently offscreen, there isn't even any good mayhem to see. Don't waste your time or money. This movie rates zero stars.",1451433600,5,339,5.296296296296297

7011043,1,B00TJ61H9O,"This is the SY-FI Mad-Libs disaster movie of the month.  Obviously, the creators of this crap have no clue as to what REAL sci-fi is.  Firequake is a soap opera.  And a bad one. Stop if you've heard this before.  Scientist develops a device for cheap energy but it still has to be tested.  Evil corporation says start it up now.  In the meantime, scientist has her estranged daughter join her in the USSR because the husband she abandoned died.  Estranged daughter wants nothing to do with scientist mom.  Mom leaves the facility in the hands of evil corp representative who immediately ramps up the untested device.  All hell breaks loose.  And bad CGI ensues. Mom and daughter are forced to bond. Mom becomes Jack Bauer as evil corp rep tries to eliminate everyone who can associate the UNKNOWN corporation to the disaster. Showdown at the Dam as Jack Bauer.... er..Mom has it out with evil corp rep.  Is the world saved?  Does Mom and daughter reconcile?  Will you care?  I doubt it.",1444867200,3,986,4.624277456647399

Then she kept asking for fruit juice and insulin.  Anybody that knows anything about diabetes knows you are talking about 2 different things.  Hard to get past that.",1444262400,,309,4.385964912280702

7011051,3,B00TJ61H9O,"Crappy Graphics, but I liked the story line. I have been to Prague and the city is gorgeous, but the movie does not do it justice. Could have been a lot better if the graphics had been done by someone out of high school.",1440288000,,220,4.0227272727272725

Bad plot, bad writing, horrid acting...at least Sharkonado made you laugh.  I just wish there was something less than one star...Save yourselves, save your time, save your money, and go watch your goldfish swimming around in his bowl for the love of God.",1438732800,3,406,4.704225352112676
7011055,2,B00TJ61H9O,"Firequake begins with a false start; teasing the viewers with a brief glimpse of future events........cue the opening credits.  Then it back steps with an introduction to a family dynamic that makes no sense and isn't explained in any details.  Cue angry daughter (Nikki Carter played by Zoe Barker) being dumped on a delinquent workaholic mother (Alexandra Paul as Dr. Eve Carter).  Dead father, girl has an attitude, her mother is only interested in clean energy, Helios, yadda-yadda-yadda.  It's conveniently let slip that the girl is a diabetic (to be used later as a semi-important plot ploy).  The villain of the piece is a geezer with a permanent smirk (Nigel Barber as Declan Glas).  He wants to rush the Helios project into completion without the necessary testing.  Naturally, everything immediately goes wrong and he blames Dr. Carter for the ensuing mayhem.  The entire world is only too happy to accept his version of events while never really explaining who he is or who he works for or why anyone should be taking his word for anything.  No surprise, he whips out a gun and starts shooting people (apparently, he's an executive and a hitman).  The story spirals out of control at that point, splitting the time between four technicians trapped in the tunnels where the mechanics of the project are situated and the newly minted mother/daughter team on the run from a crazed executive who's able to shadow their every move even into the heart of Prague!

Limitless stupidity, an overly familiar plot, and lackluster FX keep this from being anything other than run-of-the-mill hackwork.  It doesn't help that too much time is wasted on the family melodrama without providing any real substance to their initial separation.  A lack of action and/or a sense of urgency are also missing.",1437868800,4,1797,4.969899665551839
