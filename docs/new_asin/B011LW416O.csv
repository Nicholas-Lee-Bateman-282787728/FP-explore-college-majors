7335103,4,B011LW416O,"As always, Joe Lando did not disappoint me with his acting.  I love when he plays a character much like himself; caring, genuine, and smart.  In fact, I enjoyed all the acting from the lead characters.  The premise of this movie is a scary thought.  In my opinion, the CGI was done well for this type of movie (originally made for television). I liked how we see each family member's plight to find each other.  It is great to see something so rare in today's films - a husband and wife still in love and who also love their daughter very much.  Enough to risk their own lives to find her. This is a movie that can be viewed as a family.  Another rarity in today's era. I didn't give a 5 star rating because I was a little disappointed with the ending. I was hoping for more closure.  Still, it is worth the money spent to purchase this movie.",1444867200,9,843,4.225
7335104,3,B011LW416O,"I actually L-I-K-E most cheesy-flicks. This stars familiar SOAP OPERA faces---and even has Doucette, from the second Bob Newhart show---
also featured is Lou ""Hulk"" Ferigno's SON [Junior], playing a soldier. Lou and his wife have been, happily, married THIRTY-FIVE years.
The CGI-F/X was pretty good. The ending was rushed, but after 88.8 minutes, I was glad it finally ended. I've seen better, and WILL see worse.

The PRICE tells you all you need to know.",1444089600,5,457,5.0131578947368425
7335105,4,B011LW416O,"I enjoyed this movie very much . The action was good and the special effects nicely done throughout the movie! Joe Lando did a really wonderful job as always ! Also,the young actors did a very good job presenting their characters . The downside to the film  was a short ending ! I would of liked to see a little more on what happened after the crisis was over !",1443312000,2,361,4.1571428571428575
7335116,5,B011LW416O,Worst thing about movie were some curse words. Rate it about a PG. Movie was intense.  Great story line and great acting. Kept my interested the whole time. I would watch again. I don't realize why some people gave it such a low rating.  It is a disaster movie and this is what you get with disaster movies.,1484265600,,307,4.275862068965517

7335152,5,B011LW416O,"Nibiru is an ancient Zoroastrian legend of a comet or planet that will all but destroy the Earth. This movie touches on that subject in a BIG way. Meteor storms are now striking the Earth without mercy. Parts of the Earth are now in a new Ice Age. A family trying to survive accidentally find a government base that is trying to stop Nibiru with nuclear force! However, they are uncertain if it will even work. It might even make it worse! This is one of the better films you will see on the SciFi Channel and much better than their Sharknado junk. I would rate it PG with lots of action.",1459123200,5,588,4.258928571428571

7335173,2,B011LW416O,"It helps to have low expectations before switching on a low budget sci fi straight-to-DVD movie but prepare to be disappointed with Earthfall anyway. This is your typical 'run around and save the family' film which in principle is OK, but the plot was so nonsensical and the execution was so hamfisted and careless that it made the whole thing a huge mess. Apparently a rogue planet popped out of nowhere and there was a near-miss event with Earth. But the planet started pulling Earth out of its orbit, turned the Earth 90 degrees and supposedly stopped Earth spinning, resulting in one half being in perpetual night and the other half in perpetual day. But no one seemed to notice any difference when this happened and 10 days later (when most of the film is set) people are asking what is happening, never commenting about the day/night issue (how could you not notice the sun never moving??) And making it even worse, the CGI showed, a number of times, the Earth still spinning. The only climatic issue was the regular storms which followed, but after a storm, the sun came out again and the weather was perfect.... The script is incredibly dull (sleep inducing), and when there's no disaster happening the plot drags horribly. The CGI is appallingly bad all the way through (seriously bad). And just to show how nobody thought about the story, while all this mayhem is happening, GPS satellites still worked, unbelievably, as demonstrated by the lead actors on one of their road trips. On the subject of the characters, there was nothing to make you warm to them and care if they lived or died, and in the end, you didn't really know what happened to them anyway.  To save the day, there was a completely unexplained government plot to fire a couple of dozen nuclear warheads into the middle of the USA but we were given no idea who came up with this plan or what exactly it was supposed to achieve, or, for that matter, what it did achieve. This is a careless, lazy TV movie of the worst kind. My recommendation is that you steer well clear.",1449878400,18,2047,4.608219178082192

7335187,2,B011LW416O,"Mildly entertaining....earth dragged out of orbit by passing something....parents...girl child trying to find each other while dodging various calamities. Acting was overdone in some cases, others were ok. However, whoever scripted this plot just couldn't resist bashing white men who are suspicious of military, want to preserve themselves and utilizing whatever means necessary, fire arms or whatever.  Also the girls, women in this movie were beyond bitchy and rebellious, which could possibly be true in this situation, or, more likely, it is just hollyweird nonsense.  In a real disaster, most folks will follow directions from anyone that is calm and seems to have an idea of how best to survive the situation without giving back a lot of lip. Also the ending was unsatisfactory....just kind of dropped off with no closure, as others have mentioned in their reviews..",1448236800,2,873,5.318840579710145
