8630391,5,B00H7BJ04W,"Always loved this series and was disappointed when it was cancelled.  This IS the complete series, season 6 included.  I almost bought one for less, but it wasn't specific about season 6.  I'm glad I paid a little more for this one.  Some reviewers commented about a ""black screen""; and yes, what would be a commercial break is a temporary blacked out screen.  It lasts for maybe 3-10 seconds, longer as I get into seasons 3 +, but still, no big deal.  If you want to keep this series alive in your video library, spend the money, it's well worth it.",1487548800,2,550,4.396039603960396

8630395,5,B00H7BJ04W,Love this series.  So glad to be able to find the entire set.  The only thing that bothers me about the DVDs is that the producers go to black where ever there was a commercial in the episode.  A bit annoying.  Never seen this ever done with any other set of discs for a series.  It's really a minor thing and it doesn't make me like the set any less.  Just thought it was something buyers might want to know so they aren't caught off guard when it happens,1471910400,3,456,4.067415730337078
