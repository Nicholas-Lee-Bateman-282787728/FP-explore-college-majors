8439198,5,B004RQYK0Y,"I bought this DVD because I wanted to create a soothing background ambiance while I studied for college. I did not want something that was too distracting or changed locations or perspective too often. This DVD was perfect. I feel like I'm sitting on a beach chair beside the ocean, or sitting on a log in the forest, or in front of an aquarium tank with colorful salt-water fish. The natural sounds are pleasant and realistic. I love bird watching and although you cannot see any birds in the video, the mountain sounds include a lovely assortment of natural forest bird sounds (mostly mountain chickadees) and a few buzzing bee sounds - all very soothing and non-distracting. The Blu-ray looks very nice on my 52"" Samsung LCD; my best attempt at describing the video quality is ""crisp with a soft focus"" . Even though the Flower scene (just some white water-lilies floating on a pond) I found visually boring, I still give this DVD 5 stars because the other scenes ((Aquarium, Beaches, Fire, & Mountains) more than make up for that one, and since you choose one scene at a time that loops, I just never choose to watch the Flower scene. So if you are looking for a video to provide a peaceful ambience for reading or writing, this is a winner.",1384732800,,1245,4.5874439461883405
8439199,4,B004RQYK0Y,"I have a monitor in my living room showing these scenes all the time. Why, I do not know. But this has nice, high quality scenes of fish, fire, landscapes and beaches.

The only problem I have with it is it does not switch between the scenes by itself. If you are on fish, it stays on fish and you have to go to the menu to change it to the fire. Other than that, awesome.",1369008000,,372,3.8947368421052633
8439200,1,B004RQYK0Y,"A total exercise in futility. Less than 30' as far as I could see (other users reported there is a sneaky way to see some more). Not a sound of music is played, not a word is uttered.  Just 2 static scenes with little fishes swimming.  I would only recommend it for bad cases of insomnia, since this can put to sleep virtually anybody. I was forced to give it a single star since the system would not accept none, which would have been a fair reflection of my opinion of this item.",1364342400,,481,4.161290322580645

8439202,4,B004RQYK0Y,"My initial problem with this DVD was that I couldn't ""find"" anything but the short aquarium segment. Thanks to help from another Amazon user, I was able to access the other ""scenes"" (using the menu/pop up function).

Okay, so this still isn't the best quality video (does NOT seem to be blu-ray, that's for sure) but at least I got more than about 20 minutes of film. It works nicely as background visuals and it's super cheap, so I can't complain too much.

I have to thank the person who left a comment for me on my initial review, explaining how to get to the unusual menu -- otherwise, this would be in the trash at this point. Sometimes, people can be so nice!",1336089600,3,665,4.354838709677419
8439203,5,B004RQYK0Y,"If you're looking for an Ambient BD that comes with a little bit of everything this is the one to get. You get an aquarium, flowers, forest, a fireplace, and a beautiful beach scene. It's true the pictures on the cover are not indicative of what you get on the Blu-Ray. The flower scene consists of some flowers floating on a pond, the mountain scene is actually a shot of a forest, and the beach scene is a beautiful shot of some rock formations in the distance and waves slowly lapping the beach. The picture quality looks good on my 32inch LCD and you get some nice background noise consisting of water bubbling, birds chirping, fire popping, and ocean waves. I was able to clear up some shelf space by selling off some of my other Ambient BDs since this one made some of those redundant. I almost never take this out of my BD player. I recommend it.

EDIT: This BD does not have a conventional menu. You must access the menu by pressing the Title/Popup button. This is in response to another review someone posted.",1327276800,9,1018,4.44385026737968
8439204,1,B004RQYK0Y,"First of all the packaging leads you to believe you are getting a variety of scenes. but you are not.
I did not think the resolution was high def quality and I watched it on two very nice monitors.
Very disapointed.",1315785600,4,215,4.2682926829268295
