I read the 1986 edition and it was very good. ""Book was written to an audience with a variable background. Hikers, climbers, hunters, fishermen, bicyclists, lost children - anyone who is cold, wet, tired and without the proper food, clothing and shelter - can suffer from hypothermia, a lower than normal body temperature that slows and eventually shuts down the body's vital system. This compact, comprehensive book covers hypothermia's causes and effects, and tells how to prevent, recognize and treat it. A chapter on cold water immersion hypothermia is must reading for fishermen, power and sail boaters, rafters, canoeist, and kayakers. Other chapters cover frostbite and other localized cold injuries such as trench foot. Hypothermia occurs more commonly in urban environments than in the wilderness. The very young are more susceptible to hypothermia.. The younger the child , the more rapid the cooling. The elderly produce less heat because they have a smaller muscle mass ... A room temperature of 60 degrees F (16 degrees C) may be inadecuate to prevent chronic body heat loss in the elderly."" (Wilkerson, Bangs, Hayward, 1986)
