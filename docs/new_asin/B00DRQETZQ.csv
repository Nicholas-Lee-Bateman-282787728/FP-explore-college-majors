8596733,5,B00DRQETZQ,I watched this movie for the first time on TV I started watching it somewhere in the middle didn't know quiet what was going on but it still made me cry at the end. The next time I knew when it was coming on so I watched it from the beginning this film makes you think and appreciate what you have I knew what was going to happen at the end but I still cried almost thru the last 20mins of the movie. If you have not seen this movie I would recommend you watch it with your family it is really a great movie be sure to have tissues handy.,1389312000,3,538,3.855855855855856
