8309613,4,B0019CVWY6,"I am the maker of this film, so I can't say too much about it!  It is technically quite primitive, since I used a cassette tape recorder and one of the first digital cameras on the market, and I had never intended to make this film as I journey through India. However, it has proven quite popular, especially for people planning to travel to India and possibly follow the same route that I took.  It's a very personal travelogue with some lovely images.  if you buy it, I hope that you enjoy it!

You can find other films and books by me on Amazon.  Just search under Kenny Mann.  I am not the same Kenny Mann who isa musician.",1475798400,,627,4.226890756302521
