6509580,5,B00LXH2BL0,"I watched this movie and the ONLY thing negative I can say about watching this movie is that.......it makes you angry when someone can make a movie about Street Fighter this good with the budget they have and Hollywood with all it's money couldn't do it twice.

Watching this movie you can tell the writer and director are fans of the actual Street Fighter game and story as opposed to the writer of the Van Damme Street Fighter who only made a movie because according to him he saw his son playing the game and decided to make a movie about it.

It's also great to see them add their special moves to the movie as well as have each fighter use their own unique stance and theme music like the video game.

I really enjoyed this movie and I can't wait until part 2 ""The World Warrior"" which is rumored to have Scott Adkins as Guile comes out next year.",1409270400,67,852,4.279503105590062
6509581,4,B00LXH2BL0,"Good movie, I saw it on youtube by episodes, the movie is about ryu and ken in their early training. It also focuses on the akuma, goken story in subtitles, cant go wrong with this movie.",1408838400,14,187,4.222222222222222
6509582,5,B00LXH2BL0,"Do you like a great story and action that has you wanting more? You have found it! Street Fighter Assassins Fist (SFAF) is an extremely faithful adapted film based on the massively popular Street Fighter video game. Now lets be very clear that this is unlike any real life adaption of Street Fighter that has come and gone before. This is what so many fans world wide have been waiting for many years to see. In brief, SFAF follows Ken (Christian Howard) & Ryu (Mike Moh) who are closest of friends as they begin to unlock the secret power of the Hado and learn about its very powerful and sometimes dark history of what this ability can cause. Incredibly you will also get a parallel story telling of their teacher Gouken (Akira koieyama) and his brother Gouki/Akuma (Joey Ansah/Gaku Space) who train under the legendary Master Goutetsu (Togo Igawa) who is the last in a long line of powerful warriors before him. The sound in this film will literally knock you out of your seat, set the sub woofers high if you can and feel every punch and kick while being immersed in the amazing orchestral sound which blends the story that Joey Ansah and Christian Howard have scripted with years of hard work and planning to deliver you fans and anyone who wants to be entertained to the highest level possible ""a great film"". The Martial art choreography you will get to see is almost entirely the actors packing the hard hitting punches and kicks and hits well above many martial arts films being produced today. It is very important to note that many of the moves you see in SFAF very carefully imitate those used in the actual video game and this is not easy to acomplish in live action game adaptions. The aerial ability of Ken, Ryu and Akuma is mind blowing and leaves you thinking did i just see that for real? SFAF is full of rich natural scenery and authentic built Japanese style sets and costumes. English and Japanese were used equally to keep the themes and origins of all the characters with emotion that has you gripping your seat to the very end. Make no mistake that this film deserves a place on any respectable collectors shelf. If you buy the DVD/BluRay you will be treated to a bonus exclusive 15 minute epilogue episode not seen on the original Machinima channel release along with many behind the scene extras to tie you over until Season 2 (Street Fighter World Warrior) that launches late 2015/Early 2016. SFAF is produced by Jaqueline Quella and Co produced by Mark Wooding. Happy Street Fighting and happy are those who will own this film.",1406678400,3,2555,4.617582417582417
6509583,5,B00LXH2BL0,"Like all great movies it us crucial to take time on character building. One of the reasons the Street Fighter game was successful was the back story of each character. The set, scenes, wardrobe and dialogue kept true to the game and to many traditions of the Japanese culture. Great job overall. I look forward to many more movies to come.",1406505600,14,339,4.573770491803279

honestly, even those it's cheesy, at least mortal kombat the movie had good fight scenes and didn't waste alot of time on background stories.

for what it's worth, I'm a street fighter fan and know the storyline from the video game. I would rather watch the cheesy jean claude van damn street fighter movie than this version.",1466985600,3,434,4.636363636363637

6509732,4,B00LXH2BL0,"When the first Street Fighter movie came out-- the one with Jean-Claude Van Damme-- I was incredibly depressed, not to mention pissed off at how badly that movie was written and shot. Then, when 'Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li' was released into the movie theaters, I wasn't sure what I thought of the idea at first. When I went and saw it, and it totally bombed, I was afraid it might breed; so, when I saw that this movie-- 'Street Fighter: Assassin's Fist' had hit the shelves, I was afraid they may have completely ruined the game series, not to mention my four favorite characters from the Street Fighter game series (Ryu, Ken, Gouken and Gouki).

However, when I sat down and watched it from beginning to end, I found I was actually incredibly impressed with all of the choreography and special effects, and it made up for the way they destroyed the movies they made previously that were horrible. I would recommend watching this movie at least one time to all Street Fighter fans. Make some popcorn, grab a drink, turn the lights low and get ready to see the way a live action Street Fighter movie was meant to be seen.",1451347200,,1133,4.5268292682926825

From the fighting stance to the nostalgic sound track everything about this movie was awesome to me. I watched it with some friends who claimed they were Street Fighter fans, but turns out they're not.. hahaha. They way the actors portray the moves was incredible to me. Non-fans would think this is cheesy and unrealistic, but since when is Street Fighter a realistic fighting game? The movie follows the game extremely well.

Let us tell you all about Goken and Gotetsu and Goki and Akuma and how they came to be, that way you'll truly understand Ryu and Ken.-  My two complaints are that the combat wasn't visceral enough and the only female character was pretty darn weak.  However, this is a movie about Ryu and Ken, so I understand why a female character who wasn't involved in their combat training received less attention.  The combat was tons of fun even if it was really stylized.  The slo-mo bits and shouted SHORYUKENs! manage to be appropriate AND over the top at the same time.

6509912,5,B00LXH2BL0,"Excellent movie, true to Street fighter lore. The one thin you have to keep in mind is this is where the story starts. This is really just the very beginning of how Ryu and Ken's journey began. Don't buy this movie thinking it's like the other ""Street fighter"" movies previously on the market. The director really wanted to stay true to the story's baseline and technical martial arts aspects while keeping the action as believable as possible given some of the moves that Ryu and Ken do in the games. In retrospect, there is a good ratio of action and cinematic story telling which helps the movie be presented as more than just a mindless ""slug fest"". I think that the average person will probably enjoy the movie, but as a fan of the games and animated films, you will appreciate the effort put into this project.",1431475200,,816,4.557823129251701

Yeah it has some slower parts, but that is to focus on the story/relationship between Ryu and Ken. Personally I liked it. I have seen some reviews pissed that they didn't have more characters and all, but you have to start somewhere folks. Plus when you consider that this is the best live action movie with a much smaller budget than the two crapfest movies from Hollywood, I'd say their on the right path. Hope we get to see some more from this creative team. It would be nice to maybe have some seasons that build up to the SF series that we know and love.

6509960,5,B00LXH2BL0,"Let me start off by saying I rented the movie first on Amazon Instant and enjoyed it. The producers and actors did such good job (where others have failed with more money making Street Fighter movies) that I rewarded them by buying the rights to this movie on Amazon Instant.
The acting was decent, the visual effects were OK, and the fight choreography was good. This movie could have been better, but I am sure there was a limited budget the producers had for this movie. So why the five star rating? Its because someone actually did a good job turning the story of Street Fighter into an actual movie where others have failed abysmally. Most reviewers have a gripe with how the movie ends which is supposed to hook the viewers for the next installment, in essence, its a to be continued, and I have no problem with that, especially since Street Fighter is a massive story. Were just going to have to wait for the next installments and hopefully they will come soon.

Story: No Spoilers

Street Fighter: Assassins Fist is by far the best treatment of the beginnings of Street Fighter. The story covers the training and bonding of Ken and Ryu when they were youths and the development of their ki (powerful energy that would be used in their fighting styles). The story fills in important gaps of the origins of Ansatsuken assassination fist, the martial art they practice and its philosophy.  Theres a further plot development and paradoxically its between two brothers Goken (Ken and Ryus master), and his brother Goki (who later becomes the Akuma or demon). This movie is a must for any fan of Street Fighter and is worth buying a DVD or adding to your instant viewing library.",1426982400,,1681,4.653198653198653
6509961,5,B00LXH2BL0,"I caught all 12 webisodes last year on YouTube and absolutely loved this series!  It plays even better as a movie, but the 12-minute webisode concept had me begging for more everytime a new ep came out.  I finally got to see the 2.5 hour movie version on Hulu Plus, and wow I had to write a review. If you haven't seen this yet, rent it, buy it, or go see it at Hulu.  Do something, just see this movie.  Warning -- possible spoilers below.

If you've read the reviews, then you know why most people love it, and why a few hate it.  The few who don't like this movie are probably younger audience who can't appreciate some depth in their movies (think Michael Bay Transformers fans), so for them, a lot of this movie was boring. There is some serious dialog that was written tastefully and effectively, giving the story behind the two karate bad-asses some major depth, which is what they deserve. This is not a Hollywood mess.  The acting is great, much better than the norm for a movie of this genre.  Also, another reason why some did not like this movie is probably because a lot of it (almost 50%?) is in Japanese with English subtitles.  That was very welcome to me.  It made the movie that much more authentic, for obvious reasons.

This is the origin story of Ken and Ryu, as well as Akuma's. It's not supposed to be a live action take on Street Fighter 2.  That's the next movie.  And from what I hear, Guile will be played by martial arts master Scott Adkins, star of the recent Ninja movies (Ninja 2: Shadow of a Tear is probably one of the best martial arts ninja movies to come out in a LONG time).  If you haven't seen Ninja 2 yet, it's on Netflix currently.  Check it out. I think you'd agree that this guy was made to play Guile.

I've tried hard to think of something negative about this movie, but it's difficult.  Then I realized the name. ""Assassin's Fist"".  Who's the assassin?  Is it Goki/Akuma?  And is he an actual assassin?  He only fought and killed Gotetsu in fair combat. There was no assassination. So why ""Assassin's Fist"" other than it just sounds cool?  That's the only thing I found odd about the movie.  May be ""Dragon's Fist"" would have been more appropriate?  There was one other disappointment and that is we did not get to see Ken and Ryu kick everyone's a$$ at the bar street fights scene.  That would have been awesome!  Ryu takes one guy out, then it cuts to them celebrating at the bar with shots.  After that you see most of them being carried away, bloodied and banged up big time.  Would have been great to see the individual fights!  Maybe this was done to add some humor into the movie, which there was an ample amount of throughout, but I had hoped the creators would sacrifice that for at least seeing Ken dish out some a$$-whooping too.

Other than that I give it an A+!

Definitely give this a try.  It's free to watch on Hulu Plus.  Then go see Ninja 2 on Netflix to see the next Guile in action. Eagerly awaiting The World Warrior.  Let's hope the sequel will be as deep as this origin story and not conforming to more Hollywood overdone crap.  I'm positive it will, but SFAF raised the bar high, as well as expectations for SFTWW.

Bottom line is this story breathed new life into the SF franchise.  Much needed after the butchering it has received thus far. Even Mortal Kombat has received better live action treatment than SF.  Bravo!",1426982400,,3390,4.390675241157556
6509962,4,B00LXH2BL0,I would give 5 stars but the acting wasn't the best and some scenes were slow and boring.

Instead we got two stories in one, Ryu and Ken was one store and Goki and Goken was another story. There were a lot of flashback during the course of the movie and anyone who knows anything about storytelling know that usual where flashbacks are involved usually means that you are in trouble.

6509973,5,B00LXH2BL0,"This movie is by far the best live-action movie based off a video game (fighting)!!!  You can say that this game was based off the Street Fighter Alpha series or pre-Street Fighter Alpha series.  Either way I love it.  When I first watched it, I can't believe how true to the video game series it was.  Even the characters look believable.  They even did their special moves like they do in the video game (it wasn't campy or goofy either).  They did their moves like u can actually do them in real life!!! Now that was truly amazing!!  I would love for them to expand on other characters in other movies.  Now that real be real cool.  This movie made me think about getting that Street Fighter V game that's coming out soon.  If you love everything that is Street Fighter, I would highly recommend you buying this movie.  I promise you, you will really enjoy it!!!!!!!!",1425081600,2,870,4.477707006369426

Even the moves from the game was done in a way where they were believable and not over the top. Hollywood really needs to take notes, sometimes less is more and this is a prime example of that. Bottom line Fans of the franchise did this movie or film series with Capcom's blessing so it is a example of how things can really come together if you really work hard on something and stick to the source material as much as possible. I'm very please with one :)",1421020800,,610,4.359649122807017

6510044,3,B00LXH2BL0,"I enjoyed the extended narration and development of the two main characters but the ending did seem open ended and unsatisfying. The casting of the two main characters wasn't the best either for their martial expertise or acting acumen. Both are handsome but even in that category the mark seem to be missed there as well. It is shot beautifully, so visually it satisfies but overall the quality of the other essential basic film elements seemed woefully lacking. Surprisingly so given that it is, in fact, two hours plus; so your buttocks will have been tortured for no good reason, lol. Good for pacifying the kids on a cold/wet weekend but for adults who loved the video game it might just bore them into a coma.
And an obvious observation pertaining to casting and quality; the wig on the white actor was abysmally horrendous. Either use his real hair, or purchase a a good wig for a couple hundred bucks. The eyesore they called a wig, brazenly billows on the head of the young boy actor who portrays his elder persona when he is but a cocky boy. Sad, sad and sadder still, if not laughable all together.",1420588800,3,1109,4.606060606060606

I was just sooo impressed how good this movie is from the characters, the music, the locations, the martial arts moves and the fight choreography was astounding. The main thing that drew me in was the story, the origins of the characters (Ryu, Ken, Gouki) this movie explains all the questions you've ever had about the streetfighter game and its characters. This movie isn't campy or corny, it's not plagued with capcom logo splattered in the background like in Van Damme's abomination that hollywood calls a movie. I am so excited to show my friends and family members who hasn't seen it already on youtube. Since its on blu-ray, now I can watch it in one glorious piece rather than 10 minutes at a time on youtube with ads. I love you guys for making this film and I can't wait for part 2 to be released soon.

Go buy this film and let the creators/actors  know how awesome and talented they are for making this gem of a video game movie.",1420156800,,997,4.472527472527473
6510063,4,B00LXH2BL0,"I am being honest when I say that I never knew the Street Fighter story.  Having said that I am a little familiar with it. This story seems to be true to the original story. Now this movie is 2 1/2 hours long, there are a lot of slow points and most of this movie comes across as 2 of the characters being trained and trained and still more trained. The story is about 5 characters but 4 in reality, Goken the current Sensei, Goki, his brother and Goken's 2 students...Ken and Ryu, boyhood friends and fellow students. The fifth character is Stayala (I think) he is the original Sensei that trained Goken and Goki. Goki took a dark path and will challenge any he thinks are specializing in the same martial art that he is...there can be only one! (sound familiar?) Anyway the actors are wonderful and so is the story if you stick with it. Pure intro movie. All the performances are terrific but to me Chris Howard was wonderful but so were all of them. Why 4 stars? I hated the ending. Or is it an ending?",1420156800,4,1005,4.2894736842105265

We dove right in and were continually surprised at what the movie had to offer. The costumes are spot on, the casting is great, and the story is accurate. Ken's hair seems a little strange to see in real life, but it grows on you. The fights are awesome to watch and they use a ton of moves and sounds from the games! I did find that the movie seemed to be cut in a strange way, but I later found out that this was originally a web series. They go in depth with many parts of the story. The effects are top notch, the scenery is immaculate, and you just can't go wrong with this if you are a fan of Street Fighter. My fiance found himself saying ""wow"" a lot.

I was looking for something to watch and I reviewed the trailer and thought it would be interesting to watch, however, I thought it would be somewhat corny like some of the other movie adaptations of popular games. I must admit that I was surprised at the acting and cinematography. Yes it was long but I didn't mind because it wasn't choppy. Yes the ending was rewarding, but it was appropriate. It left you wanting more. True fans of the series will love it. Those new to the series will hate it. This was also true of Star Wars.

6510160,5,B00LXH2BL0,This is a true to life creation of what it means to be a street fighter fan for all these years. This overall is the best video game to movie transition I have ever witness. The development of ken and ryu martial arts form and the fact that a few of those fireball was real shows the level of dedication for this film. The film seems to take place during the alpha series when ken had that really long hair. The set is definitely worth it.,1417219200,,439,4.116279069767442
6510161,5,B00LXH2BL0,If you aren't a Street Fighter fan I could see how this movie would not be very attractive. It very apparently did not have a huge budget and there were some slow parts but the people that are giving it four and five stars are fans. To those of us that are fans this is a great movie due to the story and the musical score which anyone that ever played the game would immediately recognize. I would have to agree with the other reviews that it is a five star because even without the big names and the super special effects and at some points the slow parts of the film it does tell a story that most of us wanted to see. It is 10 times better than the Jean Claude Van Damme version which ruined any chance of another SF movie being made. This one left me wanting to see more of the story which is what good movies do.,1417219200,,818,4.024539877300613

6510163,4,B00LXH2BL0,"Best in the Street Fighter live action movies. Honestly I was surprised that it stayed with the lore for the most part. Ken masters was a bit more moody to make it fit the main story line. I would like to see another installment in this story line, following Ryu and Ken on their warriors journey... This is not an A-list and budgeted movie but it is more than a B-movie. If you need Marvel level production or you have to hate on it, then you might want to move on. Otherwise this movie may surprise you.",1416960000,,505,4.216494845360825

It stays true to the story/characters, at least from what I can remember, unlike the live action adaptions of so many video game/anime movies that have come out recently.

Great fight scenes and a good undertaking on how they wanted to portray the charecters and their stories in the timeline that the had filmed. I say bravo and I will be buying this box set and eagerly awaiting the next movie. Again Bravo Great Job.",1416528000,,326,4.360655737704918
6510173,4,B00LXH2BL0,"Overall its the Best live action version of streetfighter to date. That being said I did have an issue with how small in build  a lot of the characters were. It made no sense that Akuma, Ken and his father were the most muscular people in the whole movie. I was a little taken aback by that you mean to tell me years of hard core martial arts training strength training and eating that these guys couldn't put on weight I know want to video games the characters are drawn with ridiculously large muscles, but the guys in this movie ""except Gotetsu and Ken"" needed to put on at least 10 to15 pounds. I know that this movie is based off the street fighter alpha which came in right you are a lot younger but it seems like they were in there very late teens and under 22, so they could've actually been more muscular in my opinion. The special effects were good but with some of the martial arts move like the hurricane kick ""tatsu maki senpu kenyaku"" they tried too much to ground all of the martial arts moves in reality. I know it probably was a matter of budget but they could've done a lot of the special moves better. The Hadoken was cool, but again using what I guess people referred to as realistic movements. Movements like that kind of make everything boring. What's the points of movements that realistic when the main draw of the series is amazing skill superb strength and job dropping special techniques. Again I understand budget constraints, but The director and screenplay writer's should've used a bit more imagination the games and comics/manga and anime capture the essence of the series best. In summary I stream the movie through Amazon but I will buy the Blu-ray because I've been a streetfighter fan since the 90s. So like many others it's kind a like I grew up with Ryu and Ken. Don't give me wrong this movie is definitely worth the watch if you are a serious fan and have been well-versed on the series and games way before 2003. It was an amazing try by this direct, actors and writers. It just needed more violence and flashness. If these guys do another streetfighter film I hope they take a good six or seven months preparation before to put on more weight. Round 1 fight!",1416441600,4,2200,4.459057071960298

6510182,5,B00LXH2BL0,"If you're a Street Fighter II fan, of both the games and the animated movie, you'll love this live action complete with a fan favorite character from Street Fighter II Turbo.  Telling the back story we all know and love between Ken and Ryu, and how they mastered the same moves we all pulled off in the games this is by far the best Live Action adaption you will ever see, barring any future productions from this team.  I watched it first on streaming vid and had to get a hard copy it was so good.  No Street Fighter collection is complete without the laser disk of the anime, or this DVD/BD!!

**Spoilers** (well kinda, not really if you know anything about SF)
There are others who will poo-poo this just because it is a live action, going on about set design, casting, you name it.  The truth of it is the first time I watched this, my first thought was how well they nailed everything.  From the setting of the dojo in Japan, which was well referenced to game and anime material, to the casting of Ken, Ryu, and Akuma are all spot on.  The work and attention to detail in the Hadouken, the Shoryuken, and the Tatsumaki Senpukyaku are all so well choreographed, you feel as though you are there as a gakusei to the same sensi as Ken and Ryu.  The plot, and script writing are equally as good as the choreography and special effects, you can feel the struggle Akuma feels as he delves into the darker side of himself and becomes a gakusei satsui no hadou.  This is a must watch for any true fan,  and really anything below a four star for this is ""haters gonna hate"" in my opinion.",1415836800,3,1585,4.324324324324325

6510184,5,B00LXH2BL0,"I've been a fan of this franchise since the original SFII in the early 90s.  And after all these years, we finally have a movie that does the game justice.  I've watched the episodes on youtube and I knew that I would buy the blu-ray as soon as it came out.  What's great is that there's additional content that wasn't on youtube.

What I love about the movie is the emotional content.  You really care about what happens to the characters like Ryu, Ken, Gouken, etc. Even Akuma. After seeing what he went thru to obtain his power, you do feel for him b/c he sacrifice a lot.  I also love the details they added like explaining the Ansatsuken gloves, how ryu receives his belt that's just like the one he wears in SFIV the game, explanation of the ""ten"" symbol that's on akuma's back,etc. You can tell the people who made this movie really enjoyed their work and put as much fan service in the movie as possible.

Overall, I highly recommend this to anybody who's a fan of the genre or just love a good movie that has action, drama, a little comedy and a great story.  I eagerly wait until the sequel to this comes out.",1415836800,,1119,4.320574162679426

6510192,5,B00LXH2BL0,"This movie was amazing.  Having both screenwriters (one of whom is also the director) play major parts was a real coup for this PHENOMENALLY AMAZING FILM!!!!  This movie was a great adaptation of the video game mythos and a lot of fun to watch.  The fight choreography mimics the styles used in the game to perfection.  The run time (while long) was a good idea at 2 + hours.  I recommend watching the making of stuff as well as the movie itself as the making of stuff makes the pleasure of watching this film that much more enjoyable.  I hope there are sequels to this movie made.  The actions took by the characters have consequences in the long run and sequels will hopefully show those consequences.  I'm trying to keep spoilers out of this review as much as possible b/c I feel that no matter what you pay for this movie (I paid $25 for it) you will get your money's worth and then some.  This a great Friday Night with pizza and the boys or kids movie as well as a good put your feet up and forget about life for a few hours movie.  Chistian Howard and Mike Moh were great as Ken and Ryu and when Joey Ansah shows up as Goki/Akuma you get unnerved by how close he looks like his video game counterpart.  If I had any trouble with this movie, that is the thing I did have problems with.  I often didn't feel like I was watching a ""video game movie"" and felt more like I was watching a straight up original story.  Ansah and Howard really take you to a new place with this film.  Hollywood tried TWICE with MUCH LARGER BUDGETS to make Street Fighter a franchise worth going to the box office to see and FAILED.  This movie was done on a lower budget and would have done a lot better here in the US had it been released into theaters.  THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE STREET FIGHTER MOVIE!!!!!!  As a long time Street Fighter player and fan, I've been wanting a movie that does the game justice.  THIS IS THAT MOVIE!!!!!

6510200,5,B00LXH2BL0,"This is THE movie that captures the eternal good/evil storyline better than Star Wars and almost any other example I can think of.  This is THE movie for ANY FIGHTER/ARTIST in ANY field who experiences the DARKNESS and the LIGHT, the GOOD and the EVIL, the ups and downs of their art fully.  You will understand yourself more from watching this truly deep movie.  You will feel bad for a killer, Akuma, who is stubborn and makes bad decisions yet has the will and heart to survive with nothing and is an outsider among outsiders, you will understand the kind and creating spirit of the teacher Gouken and respect him though he tells white lies like many parents to his students Ryu and Ken, you will remember the fire you once had in you to just live life to the fullest that young Ken has, and you will relate to the stirring darkness and depth inside the quiet Ryu and wonder if he will choose the artist's path of being a CREATOR and doing something positive with his art to influence others like his master Gouken, or will he  use his art to be a DESTROYER and to survive the hatred and cruelty of humanity like Akuma.

Really well balanced video game tome with martial arts, acting, and above all STORY.  Alot of it is from Street Fighter tome and history.  As you know if you're a video gamer you always ask yourself why don't these IDIOT producers stick to what was already created and given by the ORIGINAL stories?!!  Well in this one the roots are strong, BUT there are tweaks and just things that work so well as explaining Evil Ryu.  The little things add up to make this movie GREAT.  The orchestrated parts are used in the right places, the cinematography keeps things flowing, there is alot is in Japanese speech which HELPS out significantly with the feel of the movie.  The characters COME TO LIFE in this movie.

This tale focuses on Ryu and Ken who are repeating a historical trend in their training, the fight of good and evil or rather their eternal existence together.  One warrior leans towards the ""light"" powers of martial arts, while one is influenced by the ""dark"" powers of martial arts.  BUT there are twists and turns as in REAL life, you never know who turns out what way until the end.  The few downsides include the martial arts as they are not the best and the movie is VERY character driven so it moves slower.  This is good to great people who have great tastes, but let's face it most want a stupid Michael Bey s*** movie of big bangs and booms and POINTLESS WASTED action.  So be aware there is ALOT of character storyline and not necessarily fight after fight after fight.  Having a great character driven storyline is one of the reasons this movie is getting RAVE reviews.  Most video game movies and movies in general are so stupid nowadays they are RANDOM ENTERTAINMENT and don't help us understand the human soul anymore than when we first sit down to watch them.  THIS movie is a great thought out LEGEND and STORY that encapsulates what being a FIGHTER/ARTIST in the world is like and the 2 extreme different paths an artist can take, to be a CREATOR or DESTROYER.

PHENOMENAL MOVIE!!@!  Best movie of 2014 as I've watched alot and know as I'm watching it yet again, it's one of those movies you can watch again and again and again.  Fans of Street Fighter will love the little explanations of things thrown in.  I almost NEVER give 5 stars to movies much less waste my time writing reviews for them not Guardians of the Galaxy, Akira, DEFINITELY not the crap Mortal Kombat movie remakes, BUT this gets it.  A great gift to ANY street fighter fan or movie buff in general AND especially for ANY REAL ARTIST.  They will understand and feel this movie to their core.",1414627200,22,3709,4.498507462686567

6510203,5,B00LXH2BL0,"There are some people who just don't get it. They don't see what's right in front of them because they don't know the game references. In a short time show their nearsightedness and miss all that's there to explore. Now let's take a look at this movie. Is it a big Hollywood feature? Not at all, but Hollywood had not 1 but 2 chances to do Street Fighter justice on the big screen. Epic Fail both times!! LOL. Now come these guys who are fans who manage to do a proof-of-concept short film on YouTube: Street Fighter Legacy. That 5 minutes of SF was far better than the big budget Hollywood messes! But that was it... we wanted more but it was alright. But we got more!!

So here goes!!
1) These guys actually get funding....they got produced for this series!! not just there own money but produced by Jacqueline Quella! So they get backing for this small venture.

2) A big budget was never really needed. Heck that may have even been the problem. You need people who make every moment count and they did just that. A simple but compelling story to start off with. A strong beginning to build their origins. A starting point for future series to build on. We get to see nice locals and people pouring themselves into the characters and behind the scenes people who want to make it come across with every camera shot. They succeeded.

3) Now some say that using some of the video game moves was cheesy and a joke or some such but the whole point was to make a story from the game. You can not make this film without showing the heart of how they fight. They were done very well. Some guy says they looked constipated while trying to make a fireballs. Well if you that guy knew ANYTHING about traditional martial arts you can see that can be inspired by dynamic tension in some Okinawan Systems like Goju Ryu and Uechi Ryu. The kata is called Sanchin. You can even find this in some styles of Kung Fu like Southern Mantis. Though they look very different in each system their purpose is two fold; to build tendon strength as to condition your body from the inside out to multiply muscular strength and power, to aid in conditioning and most importantly building internal energy. This energy is called Chi in China and Ki in Okinawa, Japan, & Korea. Other styles have kata with a similar purpose like Kokushin from Japan. So that is not so unrealistic. The Fireball is not fire at all. It is KI/Chi. It is supposed to be Ki that is concentrated and delivered with a double palm heel strike. Now in real life no there is no ball of KI you can see and throw like that....BUT you can build KI to drive into your enemy. The energy, upon contact, is driven through the enemy. This is called penetrating power... this is quite real and takes time to learn. All the Hadoken shows is the concept for reference. Not a new thing to do in martial arts movies focusing on traditional concepts.

4) Fighter choreography from the 1980's? Was not SF created in the 80's ? Doesn't the story take place in the 80's? All that would actually fit lol. In all seriousness the choreography is ideal for martial arts. You can see the techniques when executed and how they are executed.  Close ups like in many boxing films can not convey the totality of the techniques. The cinematography was ideal for the fights. Any traditional martial artist would know what to look for and would value what they were seeing.

5) If anyone wanted to train in something close to what they portrayed styles like Shorin Ryu, Kokushin, and Enshin come to mind. Now that's not to say its exactly like the movie as there don't have video game moves lol...but they do offer a lot. I tend to stick to Okinawa if you want true Karate.... but I leave that to the reader to research.

In conclusion the film presented a classic game in just the right manner; great beginning story, great development of characters, excellent display of martial techniques, and of course just an overall fun ride to watch. Because of all that there is no surprise that there is a sequel in the works: Street Fighter World Warrior. So who is ready for round two???!!!",1412208000,13,4099,4.471925133689839

Unlike many action martial arts movies that are being released where the fighting scenes do little to excite me and seem repetitive, every battle that took place in Assassin's Fist was like a beautifully and unique experience. The stances and fighting styles of each character were so prominently different, and being able to see the characters techniques evolve over time was just another plus.

Looking forward to what they have in the future and I hope we get to see the Chun-li, Guile, and Cammy team up in the next one (at least for a couple of episodes)",1410566400,,295,3.8524590163934427
6510207,2,B00LXH2BL0,"Our history of taking video games and making movies out of them have never been that successful. The reason is movie producers gather a team who want to be experts on something they either barely know anything about or don't know how to make look believable. The strong backlash from fans have always made it clear that it doesn't work. So why in the world are people giving this game to movie adaptation a more than generous 5 stars? Did the movie producers strike gold and get lucky? Are these reviewers easy to please fans? Or is the production staff from the movie signing on here giving it 5 stars to promote it? I could see 4 stars if maybe a SF fan liked it... but loved it giving it 5 stars? No no no. I don't think so I saw this and it fell short at entertaining me. For a beginning story of Street Fighter it doesn't seem very gripping and interesting enough to escape the B category of movies that make their way to netflix. I imagine someone wanted to make a street fighter movie so bad but only had a low budget for it. This film explores the roots of Ryu, Ken and their training to produce a fireball in thin air. There is a little bit more story surrounding Gouken and whatever but overall these webisodes just feel like a teaser to a movie. We just want to see epic fights that rival hollywood's finest kung fu films in Street Fighter form. But the fights in this are so obviously choreographed that it never comes close to impressing a diehard kung fu fan. It was an okay attempt to recreate SF but there are several problems with it. Here are some things I didn't like about this film:

1. Characters: It is a challenge to get all the actors to look like the real characters from the game including their physique. They got very close with ken but not with ryu. Not a big deal right? Making the movie using only a handful of characters makes it boring because you want to see the rest in a street fighting brawl or some tournament. Since it just focuses on ken and ryu we don't get to see that here. 2. Acting: Anyone can role play a part but it takes a professional to make these characters seem believable. Here are actors playing SF characters and possibly making it their own but are not doing the role any justice. Especially from what we have seen of the characters in animated stories produced by capcom. 3. Fighting: The fights obviously have to be choreographed but they need a different professional team to make the fighting more intense and not seem so last-decade-choreographed. I laughed and face-palmed when I saw them do a shoryuken from the game. Using CGI to recreate moves like throwing fireballs just looks cheesy as heck and conjuring them up like they are constipated looks dumb. But I will cut them some slack since this is about them practicing it lol. 4. Story: Usually the storylines have to be reimagined to give us a compelling story but it's not compelling enough to make me care about the characters. Most of us fans played the game growing up and only care about who beats who in an epic showdown. Frankly I feel like nobody really cares except hardcore SF nerds who take the story much more serious than just the fighting aspect of the games.

Don't get me wrong it's not horrible train wreck but it's not very tasteful deserving the highest rating either. 5 stars is equal to a 10/10 rating or an A+. IGN gave it 8.7 and Continue-Play gave it a score of 8/10. I'm sorry but that is a B not an A. The only way street fighter would work as a movie is if everything is created in CGI including the characters like a game cut scenes and done by capcom in collaboration with pixar, or whatever. Have you seen Tekken blood vengeance? It needed a better story but it looked great because it matched the familiarity of the game. And for SF to movie that is the only freakin way. Don't believe my review? Then do yourself a favor, save 20 bucks and watch this forgettable movie on Youtube for free.  Then ask yourself if it is worth owning on dvd. If it is, it's your money...",1410220800,5,4018,4.383378016085791
6510208,5,B00LXH2BL0,"Street Fighter! For fans of the franchise the words caused the blood to pump, the fingers to twitch, and a grin to cross their lips. Its been going strong for almost 30 years since the introduction of the original Street Fighter video game in 1987. But it wasn't until 1991 when its sequel Street Fighter II hit the arcades that the phenomenon truly took hold. From there it exploded into expansion after expansion, adding characters, adding and fine-tuning moves, and deepening gameplay. It expanded its lore through other media like anime and manga. It even got the Hollywood treatment, although with less than favorable results. And that brings us to Joey Ansah and Christian Howards Street Fighter: Assassins Fist, quite possibly the best live-action adaptation of any fighting game.

Ive been a fan of these guys since there initial short, Street Fighter: Legacy. As soon as I saw it I knew they were true fans of the game. Just that fight between Ryu (Jon Foo) and Ken (Christian Howard) displayed their passion for the material. That same passion is evident in this expansion of their initial idea. Here Ryu (now played by Mike Moh) and Ken (Howard reprising the role) have been studying under their master Gouken (Akira Koieyama) for years and are starting to yearn for more advanced skills. After proving they have felt their ki (inner energy) they move their training to Goukens ancestral dojo.

What unfolds is the tragic tale of the practitioners of the Ansatsuken (Assassins Fist) martial arts style. A cycle that spans not only Ryu and Ken, but their Master Gouken and his brother and rival Gouki (Gaku Space). Goukis use of the forbidden arts caused him to become the dreaded Akuma (Joey Ansah), the ultimate fighter. The story is actually very well-written. It flows effortlessly and explains without boring exposition and the many flashbacks aren't jarring but feel like a natural progression of the story.

But as good as the story is, its the little things that really made the show work. A name drop here and there and the authenticity of the moves  and not just the special ones. My friend Virgil and I sat through the whole season and the longer we watched the more stuff showed up. The signature bounce Ryu and Ken have gets a cool introduction and there are a few other cool surprises. The best part is that the fights are just how youd imagine a live-action Street Fighter movie would look like. Though there are basically only a handful of fighters and they're all using the same style, they never feel repetitive, which is a testament to what Ansah, Howard, and company have put together. When it ends it could very easily run right into the World Warrior storyline involving the tournament.

Street Fighter: Assassins Fist clocks in at just over 2 1/2 hours. The plan is to release it on YouTube, on TV and then Blu-Ray and DVD, so it can be watched episodically or as a movie. Im personally buying one to watch it uninterrupted. If you haven't seen Assassins Fist yet, check it out, you won't be disappointed.",1409616000,16,3038,4.779047619047619
