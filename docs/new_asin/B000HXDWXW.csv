Understand now that some of this review is highly interpretive. Thats because, while Jess Francos films already tend toward abstraction and surrealism, even downright absurdism, MANSION OF THE LIVING DEAD is this filmmaker and his not entirely linear style being applied to a concept that itself is tilted toward abstraction. A group of sexy and sexually liberated topless dancers take a vacation at a beach resort in whose vicinity is some old monastery housing the living dead. RE: The topless girls  This skill will come in handy as they spend the film in various states of undress. RE: The living dead  As with Devil Hunter, inwhich Franco reinvented the jungle cannibal movie, and as with Bloody Moon, in which Franco retooled the slasher format to his style, here, with MOTLD, he engages in facelifting, offering a reinventino of zombies that has more in common with Amando de Ossorios Blind Dead series than with Romero or any of the usual hordes of undead. Franco reveals in a special feature that he dislikes regular zombies and that he is not a fan of George Romero. The undead monks over at the monastery show some signs of decay, but they think, talk, chant, sing, practice their religion  a strangely anti-sexual yet perverted twist on catholicism. Said practice includes the rabe and stabbing of naughty female victims  with whichever monk zombie pulls short-straw rape duty praying afterward for forgiveness for having experienced pleasure (to hell with saying, Hey, sorry about that rape, and subsequent stabbing, only that time with a knife, not a zombie cock, and so forth). Said victims are lured to the resort, which has some otherworldly secrets, as well as the seemingly very real wife of the resort manager  who doubles as a zombie (and I think the implication is that both of the characters themselves are somehow the same)  whom said hubby/resort manager/otherworldly bad boy keeps chained by the neck to the wall of a room at the resort. As with another of Francos more interesting films (Im thinking of his classic Virgin Among the Living Dead, another case of the living dead not being whta you expect), Im reminded of the old school indie gem  POTENTIAL SPOILER FOR ONE OR BOTH OF THESE MOVIES IF YOURE FAMILIAR WITH THE MOVIE TO WHICH IM ABOUT TO COMPARE THEM  I say, Im reminded of that vintage gem of an indie flick Carnival of Souls. What both of these Franco films have in common with Herk Harveys 60s spook classic is its nonrational/nonlinear blending of two worlds  as though the veil in the matrix of reality is thin. So find some place, ye philes of peculiar cinema, where DVDs are sold  and where the veil is thin, and pick up a copy of MOTLD. Of Francos enormous canon (too many pseudohyms, for one thing, something else discussed in the special features), this film is one worth watching. And zombie fans interested in a trippy resurrection of the living dead in a partly new form, and who don't mind a Euro art trash context, may find a crazy twisted treat.",1362268800,3,3022,4.816602316602316
8142188,1,B000HXDWXW,"If this movie was any worse, it couldn't have been made.  It works neither as a horror movie nor as a porn movie.  It's too stupid to be scary.  It's too ugly to be erotic.  If Franco wanted to make soft-core porn, why didn't he at least pick better-looking actresses for the four strippers?  Jeeeesus, Franco!

8142189,3,B000HXDWXW,"This movie is not that bad ,but  it doesn't live up to the great blind dead series that were from the previous decade. But to compare them is not a fair issue these zombies are monks who have been cursed by a witch.
They are not templars or related to that story.  However this is clearly influenced by those movies.  It has lots of nudity and it's not a sadistic as one would assume from the  box.  but it's a fun flick and the women are attractive and it's about time women in their late thirties and early forties featured as sex objects.  One of the women was much younger than the three others.  but that makes this movie refreshing in that these are what alot of real women around you look like.  This was made in 1982 and I like the atmosphere that the movie presents it's spooky and strange.  This movie is strange and the rotting face of the main character does look like a flour face!  But I would say that it's worth getting used and adding to your zombie collection. There's alot worse out there that have nothing but gore and no plot.  This did okay in it's creepiness and it could have been worse.  but at least it has a plot , some jess franco movies have  no plots and are all images and give me a plot anyday.",1220227200,,1226,4.188034188034188

8142191,2,B000HXDWXW,I am not a fan of Jess Franco and Mansion of the living dead is the second of his movies I have seen. The movie has some innovative ideas when combining horror and erotism but it does not deliver either. It was a disappointing experience for me.,1192752000,3,245,4.23404255319149
8142192,1,B000HXDWXW,"WHY OH WHY! as a fan of the 'proper' Blind Dead films and having the occasional dabble with that nutter Jess Franco i thought 'why not,how bad could this be?...' very in actual fact.

Gone are the skeletal Templers,gone are the spectral horses they ride on,gone is the ethereal doom laden bell and chant sountrack that accompanies them,gone are the sexy dolly birds...gone are...you get the idea.

In comes bored blokes in white dressing gowns with flour on their faces,no horses,no atmospheric music..oh and not very dolly dolly birds.

Its a shambles,sorry but just for completists...and fans of flourey faces.",1176336000,,612,5.1

8142194,2,B000HXDWXW,"This was disappointing. It is Jess Franco's sexploitation take on George Romero's ""Living Dead"" films. For me, a sexploitation film needs one thing above all else: Beautiful women! Sadly, the women here are a far cry from the ""Hotties"" advertised on the back cover. They look more like 4 middle-aged, plumpish looking housewives on vacation (Lina Romay had put on quite a bit of weight at this time). To be fair, this boils down to personal taste - if you like older, Rubenesque women, then these'll appeal to you. Sadly the film doesn't work on the horror front either. The undead Monks of Cathar are not in the least bit scary. Seeing them in their Halloween masks is in fact quite funny. Amazon's description ""jaw-dropping saga of sex and sadism"" is a laugh. Nowhere close. ""Lesbian lust?"" Hmm... I couldn't wait for it to be over. I'm not sure where they got their idea of ""extreme sadism"" from. About the closest thing to kinky S&M was Eva Leon in a dog collar and chain. Don't get your hopes up. She's not exactly young or pretty and she doesn't suffer very much except for being put on a forced diet by her husband who thinks she's getting too plump.  The photography however is lovely, aided by the scenic locale - Gran Canaria in the Spanish Canary Islands.

Severin deserves praise for taking the trouble to fully restore and remaster this pretty obscure film to pristine glory. It is presented in its original 2.35:1 OAR (Anamorphic). It looks absolutely gorgeous. The print is clean and near flawless. The image is sharp. Colors are rich, vibrant and always natural. It makes it a pleasure to watch. Sound is in the original Spanish 2.0 Mono with optional English subtitles. Still, a rental at most. Buy only if you're a Jess Franco fan and need to complete your collection. Personally I prefer his classic sexploitation films from the 1970s.",1163808000,17,1854,4.719135802469136
