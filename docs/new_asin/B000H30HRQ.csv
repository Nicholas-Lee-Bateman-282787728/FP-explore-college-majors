8335915,5,B000H30HRQ,"I am so disappointed that this amazing documentary is unavailable for purchase.  As Tom Dowd died in 2005, this film is obviously not that old.  It's an important item for any music lover to own.  This man should not be forgotten, so why is this only available from one source for $72.00!!  I hope that whomever produced this incredible story will read my commments and make this DVD available for sale in the future.",1221955200,,417,4.594594594594595
8335916,5,B000H30HRQ,"The story of this man's life is quite amazing even to the non ""Music Geek"". After all going from working on the Atomic Bomb in WWII to Producing Eric Clapton is quite a story. I recommend it to any music lover or student of Science.",1190937600,,232,4.177777777777778
