8097644,3,B000CCSC74,"I was never really fond of this film, even though it was Peter Sellers' last actual portrayal of Inspector Clouseau. It started out excellent but slowly deteriorated into mundane and silly slapstick. By the time it reached Hong Kong I thought it was terrible. Even Henry Mancini's score seems a little tired in this one. It all seems like very forced filmmaking. I suppose some of the same things could be said about CURSE OF THE PINK PANTHER but in that film the script follows a logical progression from the classic Clouseau skits to slapstick and finally into the absurd. It seemed to work wildly in that film. I actually found the scenes in TRAIL OF THE PINK PANTHER with Peter Sellers much funnier than in THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER. THE REVENGE OF THE PINK PANTHER remains a weak entry in the series for me.",1144022400,,818,4.571428571428571
