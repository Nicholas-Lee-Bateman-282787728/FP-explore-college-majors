8604640,4,B00EE8AIY2,"I have lived in NYC most of my life, and find this PBS series very interesting because it does not cover the same old ground as most ""sightseeing""  videos (ie, the Empire State Bldg, Statue Of Liberty etc). Instead, it includes  episodes about less well-known sites, such as The Hearst Tower, The Park Avenue Armory, Pratt Institute, NY Botanical Gardens etc.

Please note this item should really be entitled  ""Series I""  as quite a few more episodes have been broadcast which are not included in this set (for example, the new FDR Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island). There are also some episodes about sites outside NYC  like Niagara Falls, The Capitol Bldg in Albany and The Track At Saratoga-most of these are not in this first series.

The description on Amazon is not very detailed, so you might want to check somewhere else to get the exact details of the included episodes (each is either about one hour or or a half-hour  in length). You can see some clips from quite a few of the programs at the pbs website.

Another PBS winner -- Well worth the price.  I hope they release a Series II one day.",1391472000,20,1109,4.555555555555555
