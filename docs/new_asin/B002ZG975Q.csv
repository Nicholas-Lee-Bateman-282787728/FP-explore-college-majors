4018658,2,B002ZG975Q,"I had hoped that this movie would be good, but it just wasn't that good. Sure it has some sweet romantic moments, but I was disappointed by the ending because it was so anti-climatic. There was a LOT of potential here, but any angst or real conflict (moving moments) were missed. In addition some parts of the plot simply don't make sense. However if you are in the mood for a sweet/cute movie, then this is the movie for you. Overall a bland movie...",1300406400,8,451,4.380952380952381
4018659,5,B002ZG975Q,"My heart was really touched by this modern-retelling of the
literature classic,""Beauty & The Beast.""ALEX PETTYFER and VANESSA
HUDGENS chemistry is UNDENIABLE on screen. And PETTYFER pulls you in
with his performance as the good-looking guy who only cares about
himself and then slowly but surely transforms into a caring person
with a loving-heart. I would highly-recommend this movie to any one
due solely to its strong moral to the story about it's not what's
on the outside that counts but on the inside!!!!!!!!!",1300320000,6,515,5.142857142857143
4018660,4,B002ZG975Q,"I've already reviewed the audio book for this title, I also read the book, so on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being someone who saw the book at the store and passed it up and 10 being someone who has memorized all the mushiest parts, I'm a 7, I know this book and liked it so much I sent a copy to my sister.

Anyway, on to the movie, I loved Beastly and when I saw the first movie preview I was in raptures until I saw who would be playing Lindy, Vanessa Hudgens.  Now, let me state first that I have no idea what kind of acting chops she has.  I've never seen High School Musical and have no plans to in the future.  My objection to Ms. Hudgens was based on purely shallow reasons, she's too pretty.  In fact, she's alarmingly beautiful and there is no way that Vanny could play the plain, quiet and unnoticed title character.

So, for me, that was strike one against the film version.  How can Lindy, quiet, sweet, brilliant and empathetic soothe (and ultimately capture the heart) of the jaded, arrogant, wounded and bitter beast?  Well, she does but I have to admit it wasn't quite as moving as it was in the book.  I know film adaptations rarely are, but still, it was a disappointment, luckily one of just a few things that were changed.

But, other than the fact that Kyle/Hunter (his name was changed to Adrian in the book) doesn't spend as long finding out about Lindy, her life with a druggie father, her struggles to carve out a life for herself and gradually falling for her, I thought the movie was lovely.

The book has several laugh out loud moments, particularly during the online support group chats, but the movie had similar bouts of funny, in particular, Kyle\Hunter's attempts to lure Lindsay from her room in typical rich boy fashion (I wasn't the only one laughing, the theater was packed and I heard people around me giggling).

Several people have mentioned Neil Patrick Harris' portrayal of Will, I too was struck by how right he was for the role and the touch of whimsy he brought to it.  He was the perfect counterpoint to Kyle's dark and negative fall from grave.

There were, of course, several other things that changed and I'm not certain that they made the movie better or worse.  I was dreadfully disappointed in the Percy Jackson movie, the same with the Wizard of Earthsea, The Clan of the Cave Bear, Eragon, Queen of the Damned, I could go on, but it's too damn depressing.

My only other complaint about the movie and it's kind of a biggie is that it was sooooo short, just 86 minutes.  Come on, this isn't a disney movie about a lonely hedgehog and a hyperactive moose.  Who knows, maybe there will be a director's version released and it will have some cut scenes that bring the movie length up to a real feature length.

But for all it's little quirks, I thought the movie was fun and romantic, I sighed with relief at the end (particularly because a really nasty character gets a chance for some magical transformation of his own).  Relief that the filmmakers didn't screw up one of my fave romances.",1299974400,2,3036,4.426258992805756
4018661,5,B002ZG975Q,"I was a little worried when seeing the previews for this movie that they would demolish yet another good book. However I fell in love. There are enough differences to make it seem like a whole different story of it's own. Yet it's very like the book. Surprisingly Mary-Kate Olsen gives an outstanding performance as Kendra. Pettyfer and Hudges (forgive me if I spell these names wrong) are amazing and the chemistry is so strong there is almost a visible electric current between theme. But the best of all was Niel Patrick Harris, much like Will in the book he is witty and funny, no, HILARIOUS! All the characters are depicted extremely well and I was more than satisfied. I cannot wait for this Blu Ray. I may even see it again.",1299715200,10,731,4.545454545454546
4018662,5,B002ZG975Q,"great pic of alex pettyfer in 'popstar' mag.  other than that, nothing much has been mentioned about the summer release.
alex was in 'tom brown's school days' and 'alex rider: operation stormbreaker'.  they were hoping for a full series of movies based on the books, but 'rider' bombed at the box office.
alex did a great job in both movies, esp. 'rider'.  it is good to see him back and working.  i hope he gets the recognition he deserves, even if it is only becuz of people wanting too see vanessa hudgens at the movies.
the added bonus of neil patrick harris, might bring in the adults as well, making it a family movie nite.
the story is 'beauty and beast' told from the beast's point of view, which hasn't been done before.  alex spent 4 and half hours in make-up (and 1 and half getting it off) every day.  but i hope we get to see a lot of him as he is as well.  he has certainly worked hard in everything he has done.  (martial arts and stunts in 'rider'.)  he deserves a break.",1278374400,4,987,4.263440860215054
4018663,5,B002ZG975Q,"Okay, since I saw the preview for this film I've been anxiously awaiting the film release. The original release date was 7/30/10 but because of Zac Efron's film, the studio has delayed his girlfriend's (Vanessa Hudgen's)Beastly to dates unknown. While I cannot believe that actor's personal lives are being factored into release dates for films, I read the book & loved it. For that reason alone I gave it 5 stars. There was a passing reference that the soundtrack may be available on 1/4/11, so the film may actually hit theatres on 1/7/11. After such date, I'll re-review.

I think the true breakout star for this film is going to be Alex Pettyfer. American audiences haven't seen him before unless they've been checking out British films or into fashion magazines. This film will easily do for Alex what Twilight did for Robert Pattinson, and then some.

The best of luck to him... he's going to need it. Once American girls (& women) have a look at him, I can only imagine...",1275436800,6,979,4.719298245614035

4018830,3,B002ZG975Q,"I'm not much of a fan when it comes to romance films, but as a kid I loved the Disney adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. So I gave this movie a try and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised.

I like Vanessa Hudgens, she's gorgeous and a ball of fire, but I also see in her the ability to be a good actress. I've only seen Alex Pettyfer in I Am Number Four and thought that was a pretty good movie too. Once I had my leads together, I brought my heart and soul along for the ride and I was transported back to my childhood.

A Handsome, popular albeit arrogant guy crosses the wrong girl, a powerful witch who decides to punish him for his superficial nature by cursing him with a vicious, beastly appearance. Though he has a chance for redemption, he has within the year to find someone who will love him or be cursed forever. Kyle the guy meets Lindy the girl, a beautiful albeit unpopular girl who has a lovely spirit and heart. After watching her from a far she is taken in after an incident with her father forces her to be protected by Kyle as he uses the opportunity to get to know her better.

Its very interesting seeing this love story play out within the confines of a modern remake. Some remakes that adapt this type of story-line are okay but unpopular. Fatal Attraction - Swimfan, Risky Business - Girl Next Door. Though this one is really good. Mostly due to Vanessa Hudgens but also due to some great writing. Though Beauty and the Beast is the foundation, this movie is based on a novel that bases its story on Beauty and the Beast. I haven't read that book but I have heard of some of the differences. Still the writing in this movie is really good.

The Blu-Ray is great, with deleted scenes that are nice. But the greatest and best thing is the alternate ending which is FAR superior to the theatrical cut. Sometimes DVD's have specialized Director's Cuts that allow you to see the alternate ending as a part of the main feature. Unfortunately its not the case for this movie but I love the alternate ending immensely that whenever I rewatch this, I stop at the point the movie ends and then I go straight to the alternate ending and finish the movie.

A very good movie.",1517529600,,2196,4.320388349514563

I decided to watch this movie because I had to create my jewelry and needed something to look up from time to time and you know background noise. I thought it was going to be a B type of show.

Yes, it has its cheesy moments but it is HIGH SCHOOL! lol The beast is as ugly as Gerald Butler In Phantom ( love that movie)

The Olsen twin was fabulous! just really brilliant.

When you get to the end you will see what I mean when I say...I wish there was a part 2 to this movie. I would really really watch it.

IF you are wondering what kind of language they have... there are some mocking languages like ""fat cow"" ""ugly cow"" ""skank"" ""B word"" all at the beginning when they wanted to portray the ugly side of kyle. No Nudity.

What really detracted from a good rating was, I guess, personal. The overall theme is great: whats on the inside is more important than how you look. I really don't like that the movie treats stalking, kidnapping, blackmail, and reading someone's texts and online messages like they are OK to do in any relationship. On top of that, the main character BUYS the girl's love (after he figures out what items work on her). The letter is probably the best mushy romance part of the movie.

He didn't offer to house her to protect her, he offered so he could keep her, like property. The police could protect her (even if it meant she might be separated from her DRUG ADDICT and MURDERER father (bad thing? Not really). He wanted her for himself and that was an opportunity for him to take her. I didn't feel happy or moved once, mostly just kept saying ""CREEPY! THIS IS WRONG! HELLO YOU ARE ACTING LIKE A CRIMINAL WATCHING HER THROUGH A WINDOW FROM THE STREET BELOW EVERY NIGHT!"" to the screen.

The movie doesn't explore anything outside of conventional beauty. Even with how great the goth makeup/costumes were, it didn't even touch on how there are different opinions on beauty, let alone how messed up conventional beauty standards are. How they devastate the lives of teenagers (and more) all the time because it makes people self destructive and depressed. It has this vague theme of how shallow the main character and his father are for adhering so tightly to beauty standards but it doesn't explain why. So the plot was pretty shallow too.

So this gets two stars. One star is for Neil Patrick Harris. He gets a whole star for himself.
And the other star is for the great makeup. All of it was fantastic. The ""ugly"" makeup, the normal makeup, the goth makeup. Great.",1501632000,,1999,4.591036414565826

I felt as though the movie had real potential to evoke feelings and teach lessons, all while being a romance, but it was disconnected and surface level. The characters were complex but I felt as though I never got to know them, I was just told about them (the acting could have improved this but alas it did not). The whole movie seemed disconnected and slow. I felt like I was thrown into the plot and then I never felt like I really reached a climax of the plot. The whole movie was just a bunch of randomly placed scenes that didn't add up to anything. And at the end I felt like nothing was really accomplished.",1494201600,,783,4.29054054054054

He hides for months in the house...etc,etc...goes out and basically falls for the nice girl who's father seems to be tied up with some petty theIves or criminals, Fight breaks out father shots on of the brothers of the thieves and the other claims revenge on the family going after the daughter, beastly wants her and arranges for her to hide out in his place in new york, the fall in love and break the curse.

I'm fine with this genre and some cheesiness every now and again, but this was over my threshold.  I literally turned it off at 1:20:24.  I tried to hang in there, but that's it for me. The acting is nauseating and I'm not totally against models trying to act. And the story is super super basic almost dumbed down basic...

I'm glad they didn't expand the Slone  story as it would have meant more Dakota Johnson. I think it was very well balanced and wasn't too unrealistically sappy. I could barely sit through Twilight & hate the Beauty TV show, so I think I'm a pretty skeptical judge. I'm also way beyond the demographic so the movie appealed for the way the story was reimagined and the excellent acting on the part of everyone. Neil Patrick Harris was indeed a fun addition as was Mary Kate Olsen, nice to see her strutting her stuff. All in all a well done movie not to be ignored. Vaessa was perfect as was Alex. It just didn't make a sour note. Even the growing Tatoo was beautiful.",1479945600,4,802,4.382550335570469

4021834,4,B002ZG975Q,"Like most movies based off of a book, the book is better. I think it's because when reading the book I see things one way, and then when it's put to film it doesn't match what I had imagined. Be that as it may, it was still a decent watch for anyone who likes revamped fairy tales stories.

First off, the movie is safe for kids for the most part. There is no sexual content at all, nothing gory or violent, and a small handful of cursing. The cursing is minor, just a few name calling moments. Kids hear far worse in school and on the streets, so for me it wasn't a big deal. Also the lead male character, Kyle, is obviously ""beastly"" looking due to his curse, so if you or your child are extremely sensitive to that type of thing, then viewer beware. But again, it's pretty minor.

The movie completely changed a few things, such as Kyle doesn't bother to read or learn, unlike the book version of the character. I imagine that part of his personality was removed for the movie to make it more relatable to teens watching it now. After all, who actually WANTS to do their homework?

I think that Neil Patrick Harris as the tutor saved the movie for me, to be honest. The dry wit he portrayed as the blind tutor was pretty much how I had imagined the character. I think the male playing Kyle was great. Vain and arrogant in the beginning, then tortured and neglected, and then finding redemption. I think he portrayed this character very well. Vanessa Hudgens, on the other hand, was not believable for me as Lindy. I do like her as an actress, but I just don't think she did this role justice.

All in all, this movie was not a waste of time. It was an enjoyable way to spend an hour and some change.",1477353600,3,1702,4.260061919504644

4023552,2,B002ZG975Q,"The only reason why I am giving more than 1 star is because I generally like Vanessa Hudgens. But this was her worst work yet. I'm pretty sure a 12-year-old girl directed this movie. Even a seasoned actor like Neil Patrick Harris, looks like this was his first movie. Nothing about the script or plot made any sense. The movie is about a high school (yes high school) popular guy who is super vain. So this other high school girl is a powerful witch and casts a spell on him to make him very hideous for a year. Unless someone says I love you to him by that time, he will stay like that forever. Somehow, he is not even a little bit mad at this fact or at the witch. He just accepts the fact and moves on. He falls for Vanessa's character and starts stalking her and witnesses her dad, a drug addict, kill a guy. The father then sends Vanessa to live with The Beast character to protect her so the drug dealers don't get revenge on him by killing her. Yes because living with another high school student in a mansion somehow makes sense. And somehow protecting himself, who actually did the killing, is unimportant. So the Beast gets her to fall in love with him, while in the meantime he changes from a superficial jerk to an all around nice guy. The movie was a very sad attempt at making beauty in the beast for the 21st century.",1473206400,3,1332,4.2687747035573125

4025231,5,B002ZG975Q,Wonderful classic romance. A lovely twist on the classic Beauty and the Beast where the man actually courts his lovely lady. This is a heart felt romance with a unique character transformation that is the coming of age story of Beauty and the Beast. This is a modern perception of the age old tale that perfectly represents the views of modern society. Also just a well done film on all aspects from costuming to acting and editing.,1470182400,,432,4.623376623376624

4025408,1,B002ZG975Q,"I couldn't get past the first 5 minutes of this poor excuse of a movie. The main character just annoyed me so much and it seemed too unrealistic. For example when he was running for president at his high school he actually said these words ""True or False: You are an aggressively, unattractive person. Hatchet face. Face zit. Face like Brooke Lega. Or did you only just miss the beauty vote. Any which way, best embrace the suck. Beautiful people get it better. Thats just the way it is. So, so, whats this got to do with running for green committee president? Not much, except youll never like me because of my commitment to the environment. I don't have one; I just want this for my transcript. But what youve got to ask yourself is, should you vote for me just because Im the rich, popular, good looking guy with the famous news anchor dad, and the answer is, hell yeah!"" and then the crowd cheers him on like he's just so amazing. Seriously? This guy pissed me off so much. In the real world he would have gotten things thrown at him or booed off the stage. He was so annoyingly full of himself and bad mouthing anyone who isn't beautiful. Who would cheer for someone like this? Yuck.",1469750400,,1188,4.404545454545454

4035212,5,B002ZG975Q,"When I first saw the Beastly movie, I honestly didn't think much about it. I thought it was an okay modern day story and kind of overlooked it. It wasn't until shortly after when I saw it again that I really began to see how amazing this movie was. There are a few elements in the film that's different from the novel - but of course, that's to be expected. No movie and book are ever 100% on the same level. As far as the characters go: I think Alex Pettyfer (Kyle Kingson/Hunter) captured the Prince's arrogance perfectly. I think Vanessa Hudgens's ""Belle"" (Lindy) however needed some work. Sure Belle was an independent, smart woman, but i felt like Lindy was too laid back, too...NOT Belle. If that makes sense. She didn't have enough ""character"" to me. BUT maybe that's because this story was focused primarily on the Beast's POV rather than Belle's like in the animated feature...Mary-Kate Olsen as Kendra the witch was AMAZING.

Kyle Kingson is a prick. He's selfish, self-righteous, self-absorbed and disrespectful to anyone he wants. His good looks and being the son of a famous news anchor is his perfect manipulative quality. He looks good and knows it. But his foul attitude is just a cover up for being a lonely kid whose father is never there when he needs him. Shame that he couldn't ""Embrace the Suck"" as he always told those beneath him. That's when Kendra the school witch comes in and changes that. Kendra is obviously the oddball out - seen as evil, ugly, gothy, and repulsive - though when you look at her you instead find a rather dark beauty. After Kyle screws with her, Kendra gives him the curse of a lifetime, and only true love can cure it. The next year for Kyle (who later renames himself Hunter) is an up and down roller coaster ride. He goes from being this vicious jerk, to lonely, desperate, and perhaps even accepting. And then Lindy comes into the picture, and for the first time not only does Hunter become convinced that there's a legit possibly of his curse being reversed - but that he could actually be falling in love. Beastly is a modern day tale that has to grow on you. The more you watch it, the more hooked with it you will become.",1454544000,16,2177,4.525380710659898

4035497,4,B002ZG975Q,"A ""lovely"" (good to better than average) modern retelling of the 17th century (or older) classic.  This version, as opposed to current T.V. versions, remains more true to the original two written versions-no solving mysteries.  It would be appropriate for use in tween/teen classrooms studying fairy tales or mythology, & appeal more to that age group than animated or possibly musical versions.

I cannot speak to how well it jives with the book of the same name by Alex Flinn as I have not read that version yet, but it does jive with past written versions.

I do think though that the producers make some errors in judgement when they did not choose to show more of  ""The Beast's"" growth through the greiving process or his growth thru his relationships with other characters.  This aspect of the tale is certainly short changed in this telling.  Characters, overall, could have been more firmly developed.  This may be the movies only negative.

The make-up, scenery, and soundtrack were definite positives.

Anyone that is a fan of this tale will not mind spending a couple hours on a blustery day with this movie.  Anyone not a fan of fairy tales, teen romances, or teen coming of age stories should look elsewhere for escape from reality.  Language Arts teachers should consider this for use for critical thinking (text to self, text to text, and all other Common Core standards).",1453939200,,1387,4.85531914893617

4036301,3,B002ZG975Q,"Simple easy to watch movie for just sitting around. It certainly cannot match the old classics or the made for children Disney versions of this theme. This movie is written for the young and its dialog is correspondingly shallow and offers very little character development. In my opinion this is what sets it apart from the old classic movies. Of course, the Disney version is in a totally different critique space.",1448236800,,416,4.873239436619718

4036342,3,B002ZG975Q,"The biggest injustices to the movie were #1, the passages of time. The characters will wake up the next day and suddenly months have gone by. Whoever made this movie could have at least given it the old cartoon treatment and showed the pages of a calendar falling away like leaves in the background. The way they rushed through this it makes it seem as though they fall in love within a matter of days, which seems less realistic and prevents you from seeing whether Kyle really is changing for the better and not just trying to get his life back. #2 you have 2 teenagers just suddenly disappear from school, and education is just thrown by the waste side. There's a tutor present that literally does nothing but chat and keep Kyle & the housekeeper company. #3, So what happens when Kyle turns back? The end credits show he & Lindy traveling the world, but do either of them graduate? Even Lindy was gone for months. And does Kyle remain a better person who's not stuck on looks and money? Hard to assume that he would because Lindy liked him even when he was a jerk, so he wouldn't necessarily have to change. It's a cute movie, I suppose, but I think it's better suited for the 15-21 crowd.",1448150400,,1193,4.427272727272728
4036343,3,B002ZG975Q,Perfectly predictable teen drama. All the same you find yourself rooting for the main characters...,1448150400,,99,5.666666666666667
4036344,5,B002ZG975Q,A great story of loving the inner beauty - a modern day beauty and the beast.,1448150400,,77,3.875
4036345,5,B002ZG975Q,"I admit that I love the ""Beauty and the Beast"" in teenage format.  Alex Pettyfer is ideally cast as the spoiled, conceited and extremely handsome Kyle who becomes the beast.  I like Vanessa Hudgens and her performance is fine.  My only issue is that she is far too beautiful to pass for the plain girl described in the novel.  Neil Patrick Harris as Kyle's blind tutor gives the movie some badly needed sarcasm that keeps it from turning into pure treacle. The only negative that harks to me is how pedestrian the script is at times.  When Kyle turns back to his former self, Lindy's outburst is ""WHAT""???  Somehow it just doesn't ring true.  With a later scene, Kyle tells her the story of ""how the guy is good looking on the outside ugly on the inside . . .there's a curse . . . love changes that.""  Her response is ""everyone knows that story"".  To me, those lines just fall flat.  I know the movie is gaged toward the teenage crowd who can overlook these minor aspects.

In spite of my latter negative comments, I still recommend the film and encourage people to read the book to compare the two.  It is a great re-telling of one my favorite fairy tales.",1448150400,,1157,4.40566037735849

4037767,3,B002ZG975Q,"First, let me say three stars doesn't mean it was a bad movie. You have to dip down to two stars for that to be the case. As a whole, it was okay. Doesn't make me want the hour and some-minutes back and didn't make me think the acting was a waste. The movie was too short. You can't tell a personality transformation story in under two hours...you simply don't have enough time for character growth in a way that's believable. Next, the ending undermines the concept that beauty is a shell and what matters is what's beneath the surface. A better ending would have been for him to miss the deadline or want to keep his ugly even if he reached the required result. Some might call that unrealistic but since we're talking about a fantasy story, unrealistic doesn't have to be a requisite; better to have believable within the context and as it's relevant to the theme of the story.

Anyway... while it's not a film I want to rewind and watch again, it's still not a bad film. It's more than fluff (as some reviews have portrayed it), but it doesn't rise to the higher standard. The secondary characters should also have had more significant roles and influenced the male lead. Instead, we were treated to snippets (probably because the editor or producer felt it wouldn't move the story forward) and paper characters rather than three-dimensional characters who became important to the story.

Would I recommend this to others? Yes...if you're interested in a short, almost fun, and interesting retelling of Beauty and the Beast.",1444608000,,1528,4.697761194029851

4038243,3,B002ZG975Q,"Overall, I liked this film.  Yes, the story is cliche' and has been told over and over.  I have not read the novel so I can't compare it to the original story, but it seems a lot of movie goers felt that it was not true to the book.  The book will always have more plot and character development.

I don't know if I saw a huge change in Kyle.  Yes he dropped the arrogant air  and thought more about those around him, (he really was a rotten bast@!*!  But even right up to near the end he was trying tricks to win her over and he still had this sarcastic way about him.  The only reason he had any interest at all in attending class with his home tutor was to try to connect with his crush.

Overall the story was still entertaining and I don't regret spending the hour and a half watching it.  Mary-Kate Olsen had a minor part as the witch, but she played it well.  The best part of the film was Vanessa Hudgens.  She is a pleasure to watch on screen, and I do have a little crush on her:)  She really shines when she plays more complex characters though, like in The Frozen Ground.  I'd like to watch her as carreer progresses.",1443398400,,1129,4.095890410958904

Although I don't really like Vanessa Hudgens as the main girl character (nothing against her, I like her just fine in High School Musical), I loved the main guy (can't remember his name!). The movie has a great moral too it, there is no trash or scandalous scenes which is hard to come by now. I have not read the book, didn't know it was a book, so I don't have that to compare it to. Yes, some of the dialogue is cheesy (which YA movie doesn't have that), but the majority of it was well done. This is a movie I would buy.

4038552,4,B002ZG975Q,"Cons: I wanted to give this three and a half stars but the rating system doesn't work that way.  But, I found the pros to be strong enough to give it the full four.  So the actual cons; the story is rushed.  There are certain places it is obvious we have to get to the point and understand how things are going to transition.  So the dialogue becomes very ... ""explainy.""  Instead of just normal conversation where we understand what is happening.  There are some very unrealistic events that happen, and from what modern american culture thinks of relationships some of this is very unbelievable but yet ironically believable at the same time.  The acting is ok, but I'll repeat the story was sort of rushed in places.

Pros:  The movie was a sweet love story.  It was sort of unpredictable because of the twist that involved magic.  While some of the events that took place were a bit cliche, there was a lot of story here that the writer had to unfold.  I think this movie could be remade and really done spectacularly, simply because the story and ideas are good.  Neil Patrick Harris brought in some good humor, and there was a lady who played a medium amount of scenes who added well to the movie.

Sarcasm from me and some plot spoilers.  The ending I will not tell, you can watch it for yourself. Remember, I said sarcasm, there is a point to why I bring the follwing points to light ...

Yeah, of course the girl falls for him, ugly or not, he's filthy rich, he builds her a green house, full of roses (which she loves) on top of a twenty million dollar penthouse in New York, and then eventually takes her to a forty-five million dollar lake house.  Girls don't care what a guy looks like if he is completely rich and has all the time in the world...duh.  He never explains to her that he basically black mailed her dad into making her stay with the boy...umm...maybe if the WHOLE story he told her wasn't a LIE she might have walked away in the first place.  But she just accepted that during the last six months of her life, the man she fell in love with was completely lying to her, of course, because now not only is he rich but he is ""good looking,"" (if anybody thinks this actor is attractive.)  I don't know if the guy is good looking or not, to me he looks pretty good.  Great hair, nice skin, nothing too  big or small on his face...but...this is the typical American attitude:  girls only like guys for looks, and if they are ugly they better be well endowed and in great shape, or rich....

I am pretty sure that these previous sarcastic thoughts many men's heads whom watch this and are American, so the story might only be enjoyed by people who do believe that true real love can exist between two people.  I as an American man do not, believe that all women are looking for any of those things solely, but a woman looking for a man to love is truly looking for someone whom she loves, whom loves her equally.  So money and physical appearance aside, I think these characters actually portray falling in love with eachother realistically, by the acting, script, and by the story, both of which were rushed to a point that it made the love part of the story easy to question.",1443052800,,3197,4.376271186440678

4038745,5,B002ZG975Q,"It's such a great story. Yes, I read all this book and all the other ones by the author. There are definitely a lot of changes starting with the look of the ""beast"" but it works even better this way because it makes the magic more believable. This way his character wouldn't be potentially thrown into a CIA lab for testing, simply just a freakish look for our modern beauty standards. Losing the hair, added a bunch of body tattoos which are still somewhat socially taboo. The open sores are what really clinches the look because socially he could've gotten away with it if it wasn't for the fact that he looked ""unclean"". It is a great story about body image from the rare male perspective. We see Lindy show a lot of love and acceptance that we as viewers aren't even sure we could do. Reminiscent of The Phantom of the Opera, this story ends a much more positve note. 10/10 would recommend.",1441929600,,894,4.4573170731707314

4039108,5,B002ZG975Q,Loved it!,1441238400,,9,4.0
4039109,2,B002ZG975Q,"I thought that this movie was way too long, and the story could have been told in half the time, it was very slow and dragged on.

This is the classic story of Beauty and the Beast, and because it is a fairy tale that most people know, I expected a twist, which did not happen, and so I was disappointed.
Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the beast character was a woman because that would have at least updated the story and made it new and different somehow, so Mary-Kate Olsen could have played a female version of the beast, and Kyle could have been a warlock who put a curse on her.

SPOILER ALERT.

To me, it seemed like Kyle went out of his way to get Lindy to fall in love with him just to get the curse removed.
He needed someone to love him to get his looks back, and she was an easy and convenient opportunity.
If Kyle really did love Lindy, then it just wasn't believable to me.

I do not think that Kyle changed at all, and I do not think that he learned anything.
I think that he remained the same horrible person on the inside as he always was.
After the ending, I think that Kyle's horrible personality will come to the surface again.

Also, I do not think that a bald tattooed guy is ugly.
I did not think that Hunter was ugly.

At the end, Lindy realizes that Hunter is actually Kyle.
I expected her to be angry and feel tricked and dump him.
I was really surprised that she still wanted him after he lied to her and after she realized who he really was all along.
Was that the movie's twist?  If it was, it was not enough of a twist for me, and it was not the twist that I was waiting for.

I really only wanted to watch this move to see Mary-Kate Olsen, who played Kendra the Witch.
I was disappointed in her performance, and I did not like the way that she looked in the movie.
The movie tried to make Kendra look ugly, but I also did not think that she was ugly at all.
But, I really love Mary-Kate Olsen, and so I really enjoyed seeing her anyway, she should have had a larger part in this movie, and she should do more movies.
It was good of Kendra to restore Will's eyesight and to give green cards to Zola's children, but she should have done that even if Kyle couldn't get Lindy to love him, because if you have that kind of power, then you should do good with it whenever you can.
If Kendra had power to do good and purposely did not, then she is just as much of a horrible person as Kyle, but just in a different way.

I also love Vanessa Hudgens.
She was really good in this movie.
I also loved her in the movie ""Gimme Shelter.""

I would have preferred a different ending.
Something like this:
Kyle does everything that he can to get Lindy to fall in love with him.
But, Lindy just likes him as a friend, and she just doesn't fall in love with him.
So, the curse is not removed.
Time passes, and Lindy and Kyle get closer, and later on, they fall in love.
So, the curse is never removed, but Kyle and Lindy are in love and it doesn't matter.
Kyle becomes a good person and stays that way, and he learns that looks do not matter, and what matters is to be beautiful from the inside out.
That is the twist and happy ending that I was expecting.
And, as I said before, I would have liked to see the beast as a female character.

At the end, Kendra goes to work for Kyle's father, and it is implied that she will put a curse on him also, to teach him the same lesson that Kyle supposedly learned.",1441238400,7,3426,4.068249258160237

This film just was not immersive, and I didn't care anything about the characters. The acting wasn't that great, I expected better, and the script was horribly corny. Normally I don't mind a feel-good chick flick but this just doesn't cut it.

Casting/Acting: 4 out of 5 - The acting was good and so was the casting. In fact, I would say that all of the actors did a great job.
Writing/Plot: 2 out of 5 - Yeesh. :-)  Well, let's put it this way. If this movie was the main actor then it would've stayed ugly. :-)  Very few things were interesting in the script and the few things that were interesting you could see coming a mile away.
Special FX: 3 out of 5 - Pretty good - the witch seemed witchy, the ugly guy was ugly....things morphed in a cool way. You won't be disjointed. In fact, there is a scene at the green house that changes from season to season.....really good.

Neil Patrick Harris was of course funny and interesting, Peter Krause was a totally believable ass, Lisa Gay Hamilton was adorable as the housekeeper. Even Mary Kate Olsen was pretty good as the witch. Vanessa Hudgens was terrible. I could have given this movie a four but every time she was on the screen I just felt like the movie took a hit. Yes, she has an adorable, innocent ""gaze"" (that was totally overused.)  Cant explain why but it should have been an easy slam dunk, bowl of chips guilty pleasure stupid love movie.  Love those. they have their place right next to my cheesy totally predictable romance novels that I periodically get to indulge in.

The original book ending was filmed, however, and is in the Special Features under Alternate Ending.  If you want to get the complete picture, read the book first (Beastly -- Kendra Chronicles by Alex Flinn), as well as Beastly: Lindy's Diary (same author), which is a novella that tells the story from Lindy's point of view.  The film moves pretty quickly (in the film Kyle has one year of his curse; in the book the curse lasts two years),  and as a result (in my opinion) leaves out a good amount of plot points that really would have developed the characters.",1439769600,,737,4.511278195488722

However, because he is rich, he is still able to live comfortably without much worry about anything besides his good looks. Given the opportunity to change his life, buy a blind friend, a maid, and pay for a women who is economically challenged, he can give himself the opportunity that a normal average guy would never have. The movie attempts to say that love is blind but the underlining story is. If you are rich, you can do anything,even if you lose your looks, which oddly in real life is exactly the way it is. You always see rich guys like Hugh Hefner attaining impossibly beautiful girls with money alone. So, in other words, this movie states that if your rich and beautiful, you can have anything you want, and your life will be great...but, what it really proves is that , if your rich, you can have anything you want, and beauty has nothing to do with it. Because, the girl that becomes his lover is beautiful but poor....which kinda proves that beauty is not as important as money. However, beauty does give you the opportunity to find a rich, ugly guy to snag and complete your life. The movie is sadistically, ironically sad, because it proves money is the key to everything after all, but we all know that right? Who are we kidding....Although, I can understand how some people may say that it is a story about love conquering all, but in real life, it simply isn't so. Love is always nice to have, love can make you feel 'not ugly' as the main character said, love can do anything but buy you happiness like money can.",1439769600,3,1706,4.488745980707395

I do have to say that the beast part wasn't very beastly. The so called deformities were not appalling or a major obstacle in any way.

Shallow, never daring to venture beyond teen fantasy and never trying to understand and respect its own characters or their motivations. Not to mention that a girl should learn that it is ok to be stalked and fall in love with the weird looking stalker as long as he has a nice place to show you and to drive you there in a nice car.

So her dad can't afford drugs but she goes to a private (Uber high society) school oh and she can afford nice clothes too.  I like Vanessa Hughes in it but to say she was a wallflower is stretch too but that's been done so many times it's clich now.  This movie could have been a lot better.

I think the movie went too fast and lost so much potential as noted by another viewer who gave an in-depth review. I agree with the other reviewer about the movie.

4040938,4,B002ZG975Q,movie was good. Had a modern twist to the classic story of beauty and the beast. The only bad thing was that the video buffered a lot and even kicked us out twice.,1437955200,,163,3.9696969696969697
4040939,1,B002ZG975Q,as some of you may know this film recently came onto prime for free streaming. I was super happy to finally watch this movie know I'm just CONFUSED I hear many reviews about nph as the blind tutor whitty one lines I however have heard NONE OF THEM mostly when he talks or when Vanessa Hudgens character talks I see lips moving but NO SOUND sometimes just background noise not sure if this is a flaw in prime or my device or I'm just stupid and that's the way it's supposed to be,1437955200,,478,4.150537634408602
4040940,5,B002ZG975Q,"This movie was much better than I originally expected. The modernization of Beauty and the Beast was rendered spectacularly. To watch the guy who thinks he is the center of his social universe become as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside and finally understand how it feels to be the one on the receiving end of the taunts, is a great lesson for everyone. The young man must first learn how to handle himself and then how to find someone who can love him for the beast that he is, or at least looks like. When he sets his sight on a girl that has been in the shadows of his life for many years, he vows to do whatever he must to get her to notice him and to win her heart. The internal struggles of the characters touch on so many issues that face the world today, the viewer will be able to easily relate with the characters and feel the pain and emotions as they evolve.

I recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of the Beast or that is looking for a dramatic romance story.",1437955200,,989,4.0717948717948715

In this movie this is exact the journey the main character has to embark upon.  I was rooting for him the whole time and hoping he would make the deadline in time.  This is a nice way to spend a few hours. So sit back and enjoy a love story.",1437782400,,407,3.9753086419753085

4040962,1,B002ZG975Q,"This movie was SO BAD, my god! It was an SNL skit version of a YA book to film. Everything was so poorly delivered. The lines were odd. The teenagers all seemed like teenagers they once caste in 1990's films. This was a train wreck, nothing was believable. It felt like a made for TV movie for an ailing network. I literally watched with my mouth open half the time in shock. How did this film happen? How did this film happen! How does it have multiple stars. 12 year old's must be reviewing it.

Who is responsible for its existence? I am telling you the film was horrible. The acting horrible. The script horrible.",1437782400,3,617,4.3652173913043475

It didn't try to be anything more than the classic tale. No crazy special effects, not too much overly cliche dialogue (at least not to me), and both main characters were quite believable. The girl is just adorable. And the guy actually managed to make me feel all the appropriate emotions I am supposed to feel for him - disgust, then sympathy, then triumph.

Some tropes are well-depicted.  Some not done well at all and some are mediocre  This one is the latter.  The actor, who, I am sure, has been compared to a 'younger (taller?) Robert Redford' has potential. However, this production is lazy, both in the development of story and character, and in its theme (the trope) itself.  It, like Kyle pre-redemption, has form, but no substance. The music, however, was decent.",1437523200,,589,4.3577981651376145

The transformation of the lead male character from 'good looking' to 'ugly' was really good makeup art and the story line that went with it proved a good point of 'looks are not everything'.,1437523200,,351,4.384615384615385

4041292,3,B002ZG975Q,"Beastly is a remake of Beauty and the Beast set in modern NYC with high school students.  It was as expected-- a sappy romance that made me smile at the happy ending.  While Vanessa Hudgens has star billing, the story follows the Beast played by Alex Pettyfer.  Though I did buy his distress that he might be ""ugly"" forever, the ""ugly"" makeup could not hide that Pettyfer is very well made and handsome.  Maybe he should have walked with a hunch back or limp, but no, he was still tall, athletic and broad shouldered.  No wonder Beauty fell for the Beast with a good heart.

Also, what kind of CREEP lets someone get away with murder just so he can get a girl (a girl, mind who he is only interested in because  she said he was kinda not a jerk)to come live with him????
And if it was so terrible there aand she wanted to be on her own, why didn't she just leave? Who would have stopped her?? The blind guy?? The beast who was 2 afraid to look at her??? The absent dad??? The maid???? Answer : NOBODY!
Also, if they made such a fuss about her safety, so much so that they had to keep her hidden 2/3 of the freakin movie, why did they suddenly forget about the bad guy who was threatening to kill her? Why did they never bring the bad guy up again? Why is she skipping around school, posting to social media, n going on vacations if her life is in danger?????? WORST.MOVIE.EVER.

4041438,2,B002ZG975Q,"It was a bad idea from the start to make a film adaptation of the book Beastly, written by Alex Flinn. Alex Flinn's motivation for writing her book was to create a version of Beauty and the Beast as close as possible to the original fairy tale, with the exception of incorporating the story into a modern setting. When this book was turned into a movie, the film makers had to change Kyle Kingson's appearance from that of a beast to that of a scarred, bald, and tattooed human being. This small yet tremendous alteration causes several setbacks to the overall story, and in essence the entire storyline is changed. The movie is so unrealistic that it is laughable, and it is impossible to become emotionally involved with the characters. There is one good actor in this movie, namely Mary-Kate Olsen. Vanessa Hudgens in particular did not adequately portray her character, Lindsey, as modern hippie/nature loving freak. The character Kyle Kingson is the stereotypical self-absorbed jerk, and the characters are all very much one-dimensional. I don't think this movie accurately portrays high-school or high-school students.",1433376000,,1124,5.081081081081081

4041483,3,B002ZG975Q,The movie is a average-watch! The only reason i got it on HD blu-ray is because the lead actor is hot and good-looking! Hahaha!,1428278400,,127,4.333333333333333
4041484,5,B002ZG975Q,"Will start saying that I liked the alternate ending a lot more. This was just a chance impulse purchase triggered by the synopsis of the storyline. Did not even think that this was the old Beauty and the Beast variant story. Did not read the book - usually the books I read are not of this kind.

But enjoyed watching the movie (in fact watched it three times already) and loved it. The concept of one's redemption is a theme that somehow obsesses me.

I would recommend this movie. It is a good one.",1427500800,,500,4.308510638297872

4041593,3,B002ZG975Q,"To begin with
- of course everybody knows the story,
- the ending is predictable,
- this is a modern fairy tale and ought not to be taken seriously (at least I do not believe in magic the way it is shown here)
- this is a teen movie and
- it is a chick flick.
If you dislike all of this, I suggest you simply don't watch the movie instead of suffering your way through it and writing negative reviews afterwards.

As for my personal impression: the basic idea is interesting - the story retold from the point of view of the ""beast"" instead of the beauty, the main theme not being the love story but the guy having to learn how to love himself for his own humanness, instead of bragging about being the greatest. I also liked the father-son-relationship and how it went to the roots of Kyle's character, i.e. how his father forced his own attitude upon him, encouraged him about everything, but never did really love his son. Kyle's looks were convincing too, far better than the ""beastly"" alternative which, as I heard, was described in the book.

The downside is that the movie is by far too short and the significant scenes both too superficial and too few. Though the chemistry between the two protagonists works quite well, it is not clearly understandable why, when and how Kyle actually changes, and how these two fall in love. Not only is the ending predictable, it is not really moving because the whole story just skims the surface of the feelings it is about.

A pity - I believe this movie could have been a lot better. I never read the novel, but I daresay it could tell the interested viewer much more than the movie version.",1401321600,,1638,4.4352159468438535

4041622,1,B002ZG975Q,"I remember when I first watched this movie. It was two years ago -- I was over at my cousin's house past midnight, since that's where my friends would all gather to hang out often. Said cousin wasn't home, and Friend A was passed out on the couch in another room. So I was in my cousin's room with Friend B, bored, and we decided to look and see what movies were uploaded to the PlayStation 3.

Lo' and behold, we came across ""Beastly"", and said friend told me that he'd seen it several years back and that it was garbage. We have a twisted world-view and thus we have ridiculous senses of humor, so we decided -- at 2 A.M. in the friggin' morning -- to watch this thing called a ""film"".

It didn't take long to realize what type of movie this was. Y'know, the type that the director and writers very obviously intend to be one of those abhorrent disposable ""chick flicks"", a.k.a. films you go out to watch with your significant other because it's ""like, ohmahgawd, so romantic!!"" And I knew I was gonna be in for a very terrible experience, and I was not let down at all. So everyone involved in the creation of this movie can pat themselves on the back, because they succeeded two years ago from today in making two innocent men wish they had firearms available for the sole purpose of removing the memories of having watched said film the only way they know how -- forcefully, WITH BULLETS.

I won't bother going in-depth with the characters and plot, because if you've seen any of the other 24948912829110389 films of this type, you already know them. In fact, if you even just read the plot summary, you know what happens in the movie.

NONE of the characters are likable, except one, and that is a blind man played by none other than Neil Patrick Harris, which is literally the only redeeming quality of this film. Without any hint of hyperbole, he is the only reason this film got higher than a ""0/5"" from me, other than the fact that 0/5 isn't even a valid rating here. You will wish so desperately to beat the snot out of all the characters, because of the mind-numbingly stupid things they do and say.

This film is so stupid, I actually think it may have been a sort of satire, taking all the tropes of these types of films and turning them on their heads, except that -- like I already said -- this film is too stupid for that, so I think that's giving the creators too much credit.

Not to mention that the premise of the film itself is ridiculously boring and anemic as well. ""Watch closely as this unlikable rich stereotypically-handsome jock douchebag transforms into an UGLY unlikable rich stereotypically-handsome douchebag (yes, this dichotomy was intentional), because he is a dick, and wants this girl!"" That's literally the whole movie. Just some douchebag who gets cursed for being a douchebag, a very drab and boring one at that, and he has to ""redeem himself"" by...doing random good deeds, magical good deeds. While simultaneously chasing after a girl who is not as attractive as the film tries to get you to believe, and on top of that, is REALLY annoying as well.

Great. No, not really, and you'd do well to stay away from this trash. Even if you're actually INTO these types of brainless teeny-bopper chik-flix, you can do much better.",1393286400,,3264,4.522033898305085

It's tragic that this movie didn't have a better script -- it seems to rely on you having seen every other Beauty-and-the-Beast movie, and expecting you to fill in the giant blank of how these characters fall in love. The Beast was trying heroically, but couldn't carry the whole movie with so many other factors being lacking. Alex Pettyfer still manages to make the Beast appealing and endearing.

It's about slashing open our boys' faces to examine the difference in bone structure that means one race is prettier than the Orcs who invaded their neighbors and destroyed the world.  It's about ""medical"" experimentation to attempt to recreate beauty - and what country is FAMOUS for their plastic surgery transformations, neh?

It's about the prisoners of war who saw their very youngest and prettiest soldiers taken away and toyed with by the goblins who had no respect for human decency nevermind the Geneva Convention.  The pleasure that was taken on any male who had the temerity to be gentle, refined and prettier in appearance than their rapists was not only assaulted repeatedly but also had their faces cut open and forced to live a bit longer as if to be tortured by no longer being beautiful to look at.

All these things happened in concentration camps, prisoner of war camps and invaded monasteries throughout China and Mongolia.  This IS what they do when you can't even protect Dokdo and Diaoyutai from them.

It's about being so incredibly petty and stalkerish as to know that the Chinese consider a broken eyebrow to be a bad sign and then you took the trouble to slash our boys' brows and decades later, American rappers would shave their eyebrows and create a trend.

4041670,2,B002ZG975Q,"Beastly. Wow, I never that would be a movie title. Wow. But the title my dear readers, is not the problem with this film. Nope, we have actually worse things to tell about this film than its title. Well this film has issues, but anyways let's just get to the bad things with this film; they include the cast, acting, script, plot, and ending. This movie fails to cast a group of actors that actually want to be in this. I mean you go and look at Mary Kate - Olson and she looks like she would just love to get shot in the head rather than put on  the costume's and wigs and be all witchy. I swear I can think of at least 10 other actress's that would have been way better and more excited in the rule then her.  Alex Pettyfier is not a bad actor. It's just that while he's good in the role, he and Vanessa Morgan share no chemistry. Its way unrealistic. Zac Efron, however CAN share chemistry with Vanessa and make it believable. Alex, even though he's probably the best cast out of the lot, could have been replaced. It might have saved Vanessa, from suffering with poor acting.  The script is very mediocre, and cheesy. I find all the lines un-inspired and repeated threw out the film. It's like the writers couldn't find anything for the actors to do except call Alex ""ugly"", and for him to say ""she will never love me"", and ""I'm so hot, and I'm so ugly"" it's like shut up we get it.  None of it really works. It's all bland, bland, and bland.  And product advertisement, product advertisement. That goes with the plot to. It's so UN - original.  Okay, so I get it your trying to rip- off of ""Beauty and the Beast"" okay- okay. Now what's new here? Where does this story go? I mean I feel like I'm watching a darker version of Disney's Beauty and the Beast. So what do we have, that's new. Okay so we have a guy, a handsome guy, who knows he's handsome. Who  pisses off a witch girl, and gets turned into a monster. And so he needs a girl to turn him back by falling in love with him, and bla bla bla. What's original about that? That's Beauty and the Beast, but with a less attractive title. The ending was so ugg. It was unsurprising let's say that. Alex ends up saying a very cheesy line from the cheesy script, the two falls for each other they hug, kiss. The end. Oh and the dad ends up getting the same  thing his son got. Wow, I was so surprised by that very quick ending. Poor. Now onto the good things with this film which include, the make - up, opening, Alex Pettyfier, jokes, music. Okay so probably the highlight of the film is indeed the make - up. It is very well detailed, and very good eye candy. When I look at Alex's face after he turned into a ugly beastly character, he looked so neat. And while he looked d like a freak, he looked very well detailed. And realistic in the make - up.  I loved it, I just love the different tattoos and silver scars on his face, and neck, and arms.  It all works very well. The opening which was with Alex Pettyfier announcing how rich and beautiful, was very well acted, and even though the lines were very cheesy in that scene, and so very much absurd, it still was able to start the film out with the main idea on why he was so beastly, and it was just well a good introduction into the dastardly character Alex played.  This leads me into my next topic which is about how Alex suited the role. While I think he should been replaced with Zac, he wasn't a poor choice for the role. He was very convincing as the self - centered jerky character that is Beastly. And very convincing I really liked him. The jokes in this film are very good. While the jokes were definitely not supposed to be in this film and were done by accident (apparently) this film did hold me over for those few jokes that snuck their way onto the scripts. And I loved em!  I loved the opening music, which was catchy and got people's attention, Well All and All, this film is not a successful romantic film, and fails to become the classic ""Beauty and the Beast' was, but with the help of a few detailed works, and a very attention grabbing trio, we don't have a miss either.

4041683,4,B002ZG975Q,"I read Beastly in almost one sitting. It was a very fast, sweet read and I love the tale of Beauty & The Beast. Alex Flinn nailed it when adapting this tale into a modern day retelling. As with all movie adaptations I was a little worried that the movie would spoil the sweet story I had envisioned as I read the book. My initial concerns were only face value:

1.) Vanessa Hudgens did not physically fit the character of Lindy.
2.) Kyle wasn't a ""Beast"" he was more of a victim of an angry tattoo artist
3.) The standard plea...""Oh please stay true to the book""

I am very happy to report that I (and Kelli) truly enjoyed this movie! I loved all the changes that were made for the big screen. Alex Pettyfer is on FIRE! And he did great portraying Kyle/Grant/Adrian. I actually think that Kyle was more disturbing in the movie and a true modern day beast. I really liked the tree tattoo that kept track of the passing year & Mary Kate Olsen really pulled off Kendra the Witch. And how funny was Neil Patrick Harris?! I loved him as Will. He really gave the movie the comic relief that was needed just at the right moments.

Right after watching the movie my little sister immediately went and bought the book and read it straight through... who says movies can't motivate the youth to read :)

4041689,4,B002ZG975Q,"Beastly is probably going to end up a guilty pleasure of mine in the long run.  It's a romantic teen movie in the same category as the Twilight series.  It's not intended for 32-year old adult men such as myself and yet, I ate it up anyway.  I gotta be honest though- as much as I may have eventually warmed up to it, I was NOT so receptive towards the really bad writing in the beginning.

It's about an arrogant pretty boy played by Alex Pettyfer who believes he's unbelievably attractive to the point he can get away with disrespecting his female classmates, however after he makes a rude comment towards one of his female classmates who's apparently a witch of some kind (played by Mary Kate Olsen) she puts a spell on Alex that makes him ugly, completely changing not only his facial appearance but his personality and outlook on life (due to the fact he's stuck with his new appearance).  This is his punishment until he finds a girl to fall in love with, and then the spell will be erased.  This changes Alex's perception of the world in a dramatic way.  Not a bad concept, however there are a couple issues.

One is the most obvious one that I already mention above- this is certainly a movie for teens, and not only that, it's rather lovey dovey for the most part, neglecting to include any kind of comedy or enticing drama.  It's all romance for the most part.  One thing I find odd is that, the girl he has a crush on (played by the VERY beautiful Vanessa Hudgens) happens to find herself in a dangerous situation one evening, and Alex comes to her rescue and basically threatens her father that she MUST live with Alex.  His explanation was unusual which results in a strange bit of flawed storytelling, I think.  While Vanessa is living with Alex Pettyfer, I think it's extremely obvious the two of them would inevitably fall in love.  I mean she's basically being held right THERE (without much of a struggle- another storyline flaw) in his house, so she's basically available right then.  Lousy writing.

Other characters such as Neil Patrick Harris feel tacky and unnecessary, as does the maid (Lisa Hamilton).  This storyline probably could have succeeded without those characters.  Anyway Alex Pettfer turning into a respectable young man gradually as the storyline moves along is decent enough writing, and overall the movie just gets better and better (though predictably so, unfortunately) until its conclusion.  I do feel guilty giving this film such a high rating but it *did* keep me attached and that's what matters the most.  You can probably guess what happens at the end too.  Highly recommended.  Just avoid the really horrible first 15 minutes.  Yikes is that portion of the movie ever deplorable.",1371945600,,2727,4.6968421052631575

This was a rental and I was pleased with the speed of uploading, the quality of the video/ audio and the playback options (so the technical side would get 5 stars ).",1352160000,,554,4.455445544554456
4041767,2,B002ZG975Q,"I've been wanting to see this movie because I love Beauty and Beast as a storyline, despite the fact that I hate the Disney version with Belle, Gaston, and the teacups.  But what a disappointment this movie was.

First, perhaps the disappointment is my own fault.  This is, after all, a very teeny-bopper movie.  However, there have been very good teeny-bopper movies in the past (i.e. Clueless, Mean Girls).  My biggest criticism of this movie is that it plays as something that just didn't have much financing behind it.  Hence, the poorly written script, which contained very cheesy lines (perhaps they work in a book form, or maybe better actors would have been able to do them more justice), poor character development (what makes Hunter change? why does Kyle/Hunter even like Lindy? the housekeeper and the tutor deserve more time to really flesh out their characters and the role they play in Kyle's transformation), and sub-par acting.

I have not read the book, and can only imagine that it was much better for a movie to have been made of it.  I've seen some pretty good reviews for this movie, though, and I can only suppose that those who enjoyed the movie read the book first and absolutely loved the book to the point where they were able to forgive the movie.  Otherwise, I can't account for any of the positive reviews.",1351468800,,1335,4.719827586206897

4041769,4,B002ZG975Q,"I am going to say that I'm a sap.  I also did not read the book before seeing Beastly. If you take the movie for what it is, it's actually quite good.  I don't spend my time hung up on plausibility and what the book says. It's not high brow it's mindless entertainment.

The actors were pretty good.  Alex Pettyfer has raw talent.  It would be interesting to see how his career will turn out as he matures. Story reminds me of Beauty and the Beast. They should have given more time for character development. For instance Lindy's father was barely seen.

I do think the alternate ending was better than what they ultimately used but again, we're dealing with continuity issues with the second ending because the bad guy showed up from nowhere.  If they expanded the time for the movie maybe it would work.

Anyway for the price of this movie, it's worth it.",1348358400,,857,4.448717948717949
4041770,4,B002ZG975Q,I have to say I only wanted to watch this movie for the leading male character. Alex Pettyfer is such a strong actor and not bad to look at either. He adds so much life to his characters and I was hoping that Vanessa Hudgens would do poorly in comparison but I was actually surprised to see she could keep up with his performance. Beauty and the Beast is still one of my favorite Disney themes and I like to see it played out in a modern way with breathing characters. Instead of the princess gown and fun songs there is real person in the role with real problems. The beast is a spoiled rich kid with no designs for others only himself but you could see his gradual transformation until at last you saw his physical deformities replaced with handsome good looks. This is a darker version of the story so I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but it was good nonetheless.,1347926400,,869,4.337423312883436

4041789,5,B002ZG975Q,"If you're a fan of the story of Beauty and the Beast (in all of it's various forms and translations), you'll like this modern translation.  Some of the lines are overly predictable and silly-sappy, but a lot of it is a decent or excellent translation of the classic fairy tale.

The actor who plays ""the beast"" does an excellent job of it.  It's not the best acting in the world but he does show all of the emotions at the right time, and his reactions to the scenes are excellent (and like all renditions of this story, he looks better deformed than normal...).

The actress who plays ""belle"" is equally sweet; again, the character is a little predictable, but her reactions are perfect.

The gentleman who plays the blind tutor (Will) is just spot on with his lines and character, and honestly, he should be in the movie more promenantly, along with the woman who plays the house keeper; they might actually be the two best charcters throughout this movie, which is usually the case with the not-so-main characters.

Even the witch is enjoyable in this movie; I never thought I'd say I liked an Olson in a production, but...Yeah, she does a good job playing the self-assured, all powerful witch in a way that is a stereotype with a bit if a twist.

I'm particularly drawn to this version because the setting, reactions, lines, characters, everything is a real true-to-life variation of this story that just shows perfectly how it might be in our current times.

4041804,3,B002ZG975Q,"""Beastly"" is a filmic version of an Alex Flinn novel of the same title, a modern retelling of the famous story of ""Beauty and the Beast."" Anyway, that's what they say. Not having read the original book, I cannot be sure, but it looks as if so much stuff is missing in the film adaptation, which feels often rushed.

Now, ""the Beast"" is Kyle (Alex Pettyfer, ""I Am Number Four""), handsome, popular but arrogant high school student, and son of a news anchor; ""Beauty"" is Linda (Vanessa Hudgens, ""High School Musical""), a quiet student of the same school who has to live with him (for a very contrived reason) in an expensive New York house with him.

The film's story is told from the viewpoint of Kyle, who is turned into the ""Beast"" by Kendra, an eccentric student, or ""enchantress,"" effectively played by Mary-Kate Olsen. Dakota Johnson appears as Sloane, Kyle's girlfriend before he becomes ""beastly,"" but her role is almost non-existent, even pointless.

The screen time of ""Beastly"" (that runs only 86 minutes) is too short for what it wants to be. It is too short for Kyle and Linda's romance to be believable, which needs more space to develop. The film is also humorless. Humor comes in the form of Neil Patrick Harris's tutor Will. Talented as he is, his character does not have much to do in the underwritten storyline.

Watching ""Beastly"" is like eternally waiting for something interesting to happen. It does when Mary-Kate Olsen and Neil Patrick Harris show up on the screen. Unfortunately, they are not the stars of the film.",1329609600,4,1537,4.745318352059925

I read the book years before this movie came out and loved it so I decided to give the movie a try. Had I not read the book, I probably would have given this movie a higher rating but comparing it to the book it was based on leads to it falling short. The characters were better developed in the book. And, the ending of the book was very different than the movie which took away from the story. However, there was an alternate ending on the DVD that better followed the book.

This movie shows Kyle's transformation as person when a witch makes him ugly and gives him a year to find someone to love him. I think this movie presents a great message that it is not your appearance that is important but the content of your character. The actors did a great job to deliver this message through their interactions with each other and their portrayal of emotions.

But in all the other princess fairy tales-Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, The Little Mermaid-the guy or girl take one look at the other and-presumably liking the hot prince or princess-fall madly in love. Even as a little girl I realized that Belle's love for the Beast was more 'real' and normal than that of Ariel's or Cinderella's 'love' for their princes.
In this modern-day retelling, we watch self-centered Kyle realize what a shallow life he'd been living and try to make a new start. Lindy is cautious, but ultimately loves him for who he is on the inside, not how he looks. Kyle's often inept attempts to win her heart and her various reactions are a joy to watch, as he tries for the first time to not charm his way into a heart but to earn the love bestowed upon him and she reservedly begins to allow herself to be wooed. Neil Patrick Harris was hilarious, every dryly delivered quip had me smirking or giggling more and reaching for a pen to write them down for later.
Ultimately, it is the tender love story, focusing on the hearts and souls of two people and not how pretty they look together that endeared Beauty and the Beast to me once again. I'd take Kyle over Prince Charming any day. Because he's real.",1321660800,,1335,4.54356846473029

Geez, I read the complaints in the other reviews saying, ""why is there a witch"" or ""it's so unbelievable"". Well, duh! How will there be a curse if there isn't a witch to put the curse? Yeah, and are werewolves and vampires more believable? It's a good movie with a good moral (inside beauty is more important than outer beauty). No sex, no cussing -- which isn't necessary in this movie anyway. Alex Pettyfer is such an eye candy, so that's a plus.

This is just a modern day retelling of Beauty and the Beast but done very badly. The screenwriters made this movie more of a teen chick flick than what it should had been.

In the beginning of Beauty and the Beast there is a witch that goes to the guy/prince for help and when he doesn't help her, the witch puts a curse on him. In this movie, it's more the witch just shows up and is just there. The guy makes fun of her and so she gets back at him with a curse. This was close to the story main point, but doesn't really work if you already know the true Beauty and the Beast story.

All the teen flick ideas comes in by the guy actually caring about what other High School teen think about the guy. The guy best friend and his girlfriend cheats on the guy. Who cares? Then, a few other stuff that wasn't needed for this movie, but to make it into more of a teen flick.

I really didn't like the guy in this movie. This movie him get a beautiful girl too easy just because he has money. You can be really ugly and just have money to get a beautiful girl that what I saw. Also, most people would call him a stalker because he follows her around nightly. He goes though her web page account and learns things about her. She gets knock out and immediately takes her away. Then, he demands her to leave with him. He says it's for her protection, but we all know that he really a super stalker!

Vanessa looks hot as she usually does, but since this isn't high school musical, she doesn't have much acting skills. Also, since she not signing songs, she has to make up the difference in talent, but she doesn't have the skills too. So, she was just okay to be in this bad movie.

I don't recommend this movie. Just go get the Disney cartoon version is still better than this.",1318118400,2,1855,4.096418732782369

I think Vanessa Hudgens is an underrated actress, which probably puts me in the minority. I hope she can shed her HSM past and take more adult roles. This is also the best performance I've seen from Alex Pettyfer. His ""ugly"" self must have inspired him.",1317945600,7,392,4.383561643835616
4041830,3,B002ZG975Q,"Rich, popular high school student Kyle Kingston (Alex Pettyfer) has it all.  Which means, since he's the star of a teen Hollywood movie, he's about to lose it all and learn some Life Lessons in the process.  When his arrogance attracts the attention of a witchy-looking girl (Mary-Kate Olsen, he finds himself becoming well - beastly.  Well, sort of.  The Kyle in the eponymous book fares much worse - literally turning into a beast.  With fur that grows back within minutes. Movie Kyle just loses his hair and acquires some freaky tattoos.  Horrified at the change in his son, Kyle's mean, shallow dad (Peter Krause) sequesters him in a fancy apartment and hires Neil Patrick Harris as a live-in tutor.  He has only a year in which to find a girl who truly loves him for who he is - which means becoming less self-centered - otherwise the curse is permanent.

 Pettyfer, who is also a model, looks the part of a spoiled brat, but he seems half-hearted about acting nasty.  He's much better during the rest of the movie which requires him to look wounded, angry and vulnerable.  I actually found the tattoos kind of sexy.  Since his character still resembles an actual human being, the whole necessity of having him stay away from other people and not be permitted to attend school was missing.  Especially, in the city - who would really give him more than a second glance?  There was absolutely no danger or drama that he might be recognized skulking around with a hoodie.

 Fans of the book should know that quite a bit is changed - including character names.  The ending is changed, too - we never find out what happens when Kyle's dad sees his transformed son.  Frankly, I thought keeping it would send a stronger message about what family really is and be a happier ending, but then who watches movies for the message?",1317859200,2,1824,4.629283489096573
4041831,4,B002ZG975Q,"Alright, not going to lie. The only reason why I gave this review 4 stars is because the Disney version Beauty and the Beast is my absolute favorite all time disney movie, and possible favorite movie of all time. I absolutely LOVE that movie. When I heard that a modern version of Beauty and the Beast was going to come out (Obviously ""Beastly"") I was absolutely ecstatic that I made sure I saw this movie on the day it came out. I never heard of the book until the title of the movie. So I read the book (after i watched the movie in theaters).

When watching the movie, it was a cute story...but I could feel something was missing out of the whole movie. It felt so anti-climatic that it just wasn't right. I read the book, and like numerous of times...the book had plenty of parts that wasn't added in the movie. Yes, I understand it's a movie and some parts are going to be cut out and others are going to be added randomly...but the parts that was cut out were kind of major. Without those parts, it made the movie feel really bland. The casting was good (Especially Alex Pettyfer..hehe) and the guy who played the blind tutor (don't remember his real name...or even his acting name really...I don't remember it being  mention very often)...sheesh...I think the blind tutor was honestly what made the movie enjoyable. He had some pretty funny lines in there.

But watching the movie, you can tell that they left something out. The general plot is how Kyle is going to learn how see beyond looks and beauty and that it's what inside that counts (how cheesy does that sound? lol it's true though). But there was something else missing along with it.

This movie is probably worth watching once...maybe twice...but it's not exactly something to go and blow your money on for the blu-ray or dvd. Seeing it in theaters was good enough. Renting it should suffice if anything.",1317168000,,1874,4.535502958579881

4041834,3,B002ZG975Q,"Thank goodness for hoodies! Else how could our repulsive lead wend his way across New York City without people getting all gape-y and finger-pointy? Regarding cinematic adaptations of this classic fairy tale, BEASTLY isn't about to supplant Jean Cocteau's masterpiece or the gorgeous Hamilton/Perlman television series or the Oscar Best Picture-nominated Disney animated film. But neither is BEASTLY a steaming pile of poopage, either, as them critics what be purporting. If you rummage in there, you'll unearth several redeeming grace notes, at least enough for me to rate this sucker 2.5 out of 5 stars, a passable mark.

First, you have to like Vanessa Hudgens - and, yep, right there I can sense some folks already tuning off. Hudgens sold me in BANDSLAM, a movie that I dig to absurd levels. She brings a waifish quality as Lindy, the Beauty in this bit. And her smile is never less than entrancing. I happen to think that Mary-Kate Olsen is a left-field choice which ends up working, although initially I was doubting as Thomas. And Neil Patrick Harris brightens up each scene he's in as Kyle's blind tutor. Ultimately, the romance of Beauty and her Beast may be my favorite fairy tale of all time, so I'm always up for any iteration of it.

If you can transpose Austen and Shakespeare's works to modern-day high school, why the heck not Beauty and the Beast? So be it. BEASTLY, adapted from Alex Flinn's YA novel, opens with seventeen-year-old Kyle Kingson (Alex Pettyfer) delivering a public speech as his classmates admiringly look on. Kyle Kingson surveys his high school realm and basks in the glow of his own grand poobahness. And maybe you can forgive him his smugness, if he also doesn't make a huge point of ragging on those he deems inferior (which is pretty much everyone else). Some distance away, a quite, grounded girl named Lindy observes him. She's not in his social circle. She's not even on his radar.

The notorious Kendra (Olsen), however, is very much up Kyle's nose, what with her in direct competition for the school presidency he covets. A rumor bandied about is that Kendra, with her weird gothy looks and odd behavior, is a witch, and maybe Kyle should've taken heed before he humiliated her in public. Kendra casts a spell which physically transforms Kyle Kingson into a freakshow, tattoos and boils and ugly scars and rampant baldiness, his appearance now reflecting the ugliness within. Kendra decrees that unless Kyle finds someone to love him within a year's time, his new look will become permanent. ""Kyle?"" she remarks and throws his words back at him, ""Best embrace the suck."" Oh, snap.

The son of a well-off single parent (and a famous news anchor, at that), Kyle steals himself away in a huge isolated apartment, and this will have to pass as the Beast's forbidding castle. Kyle pins his hopes on his father, but his dad is a neglectful tool what can't cope with what's befallen his son. If he's one of them types to pick up a broom, he'd sweep his own son under the rug. Easy to suss out who's been imparting life lessons to Kyle. After five months of neglect and self-imposed exile, Kyle has pretty much given up.

But then he runs into Lindy.

This being a modern retelling, you can work out what happens next. And maybe that's one of the film's flaws, that it doesn't bother to step out of its predictable tweaking. The dialogue is unsnappy. And, glaringly, how Lindy comes to stay at Kyle's apartment just doesn't go down believably. More, the message of inner beauty over superficiality is kicked to the dirt a bit because, it turns out, Pettyfer rendered with thorn tattoos and bereft of follicle is still a pretty attractive-looking and buff hombre. It's a no-brainer that the filmmakers were angling for the teen girl votes, another reason why Pettyfer went shirtless a bunch of times. Still, one wishes he'd looked really repugnant, to lend more resonance to the love story. Perhaps some fur was needed, and paws with claws. Who would've thought I'd miss Robby Benson? There's enough eye candy provided by the two leads. And if you relish watching this tale as old as time progressing down its traditional trajectory (or close enough to it), then BEASTLY has something to offer you. But this is a pale, watered down version.

The DVD's bonus stuff: an Alternate - and, frankly, even more draggy and awkward - Ending (00:10:12 minutes long); 3 non-impactful Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:04:48 minutes); ""A Classic Tale Retold: The Story of BEASTLY"" - basically the Making Of the film featurette as the cast and author Alex Flinn share their thoughts about the film (00:10:06); ""Creating the Perfect Beast"" - what went into creating the look of the Beast (00:05:07); and the ""Be Mine"" music video by Kristina and the Dolls.",1316822400,3,4773,4.82051282051282

4041836,4,B002ZG975Q,"I actually enjoyed watching this movie! After reading the negative reviews, I took a chance on seeing this, & I'm glad I did. I got exactly what I was seeking--a tender and earnest story about 2 personalities connecting without the distortion of lust, a story that made me feel warm and hopeful.  Some people have complained that this movie wasn't realistic, but that wasn't a problem for me because I know that some movies are meant to be an escape from some of the harsh or boring realities of everyday life. I think 'Beastly' provided that temporary escape and seclusion with it's slightly surreal and whimsical backdrop placed in contrast to the gritty, detached, and self-absorbed city life.  I admit that the movie is not perfect--I liked the characters, but they could have been written with a little more dimension, and the ending could have used more substance. For instance, key scenes that were glossed over with a montage or time lapse could have been done as full dialogue scenes to really see them build the foundation of the relationship between Beauty and her Beast.  Also, after the ""happily ever after"" moment, I personally would have liked more of a glimpse at how the leading man went about life and society differently as a permanently ""changed man"". We know he got the girl, but I want to see what his new attitude and outlook inspired him to do with is life.  Despite its minor imperfections, I would definitely watch this film again and recommend it to my friends, because even though I'm in my late 20s, I know that I'll never outgrow transforming love and happy endings.",1316304000,,1596,4.750902527075812

4041841,4,B002ZG975Q,"""Beastly"" is loosely based on ""Beauty and the Beast"", but it's a modern adaptation that deviates significantly from the original story.  It's analogous to the way ""10 Things I Hate About You"" is loosley based on Shakespeare's ""Taming of the Shrew"".  In fact, both adaptations use a high school setting.

Like ""10 Things"", Beastly's deviation from the original is done well.  The story appeals to teenagers and tweeners, but probably is not suitablke for young Disney kids.  The movie also appeals to my wife due to its combination of romantic love story, fantasy, and simplistic high school character motivations.  but then, my wife likes every version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" ever produced (yes, even the old black-and-white French film).  ""Beastly"" was my wife's birthday gift from our 16-year-old daughter, and they watched it together more than once during the first month.

I'm a middle-aged guy who likes typical guy movies.  This isn't one of them - not even close.  I enjoy the occasional high school flick also, but this movie uses high school kids more than it takes place in a high school.  I thoroughly enjoy epic fantasy movies, but ""Beastly"" is light fantasy at best.  I'm trying hard not to type a spoiler here, so you'll have to discover the rest for yourself.

As for the medium, this Blu-Ray disk was just fine.  My family doesn't get into much beyond the movie itself, so most extra features have no value to me.  All I remember is that the movie plays correctly every time, and the menues are easy enough to navigate.

Another good scene is when Hunter watches the Beauty leave her apartment, buy a book, and skip down the sidewalk while talking to herself. She enjoys being alive and Hunter enjoys her enjoyment.

4041883,2,B002ZG975Q,"Beastly.  First it was a book based off the tale, Beauty and the Beast.  Then, when producers saw how much money it drew from the teen and tween crowd, it became a movie starring Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens.

Kyle Kingston is a self-absorbed teenager, son of a similarly self-absorbed reporter.  He has been raised to admire two things in life: money and good looks.  When he upsets a witch, Kendra, he is cursed with being ugly and having to find someone to love him before the year is out.  Will Kyle find his true love or will he be ugly forever?

I read the book back in March and my overall thoughts were this:

""This book was a fun timewaster, but I think it could have been a lot better. I remember reading Robin McKinley's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beauty/dp/B005H0CBC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beauty</a>&nbsp;and being enchanted; years later, I hunted down the book and bought it (and have plans to reread--eventually). But I just don't see this book lasting very long, not with the very specific culture references. And we all know how long culture trends and fads last...
Now that I've read it, I think I'm probably going to sell it back; it's just not one of those books I want to keep on my shelf and reread. However, I do have plans to see the movie; hopefully, the movie will bring some new insights.""

As you expect, the movie changes quite a bit, from the names of characters (""Adrian"" is now ""Hunter"", ""Magda"" is now ""Zola"", ""Kingsbury"" is now ""Kingston""), to the characters themselves (Sloan goes from being vapid to being just a girl downtrodden by her boyfriend), to some events (the final climax of the book is completely omitted).  Some of them make sense...and some don't.

The characters range from meh to terrible.  Kyle just isn't as appealing as his book form.  Here, he makes a ludicrous speech for being elected to Environmental President.  Why would he do this?  Nothing in his personality suggests ""caring for the environment"".  Why couldn't he be elected student president?  Why do the instructors let him get away with such a silly speech?  ""Elect me because I'm beautiful and you aren't""?  Geesh.  Kyle, once afflicted with ugliness, doesn't attempt to change into a better person, a person who gets a grip on his new features by studying and getting interested in roses.  Instead, Kyle mopes around, stalking Linda until he is in love with her and THEN begins to change.  But even this change is almost non-existent--when he had no character before, other than ""I'm obsessed with looks"", it's hard to change into anything with depth.  Alex Pettifyr tries really hard in his performance, but when a lot of the character of Kyle is changed so that there really is nothing to work with, it's hard for him to succeed.

Linda has changed from nerdy, plain girl to environmental freak (in name only--she doesn't bring her own coffee cup when getting coffee or any other attribute you might find in the someone promoting greenness), feed the homeless, gorgeous Vanessa Hudgens.  While she does have a spark of independence not shown in the book (such as the scene where her dad drops her off at Kyle's), overall, Linda is boring.  Even more boring than her book counterpart (which, if you read my review, means a lot).  And Vanessa does nothing to make it better.  At one point, she looks like a dead fish as Kyle tells a story about a mother elephant returning to where her dead elephant babies were (although, I will give her this: that story was a PAINFUL way to try to woo a woman!).

Kendra the Witch looks nothing like her book counterpart.  In the book, she was fat (possibly with greasy hair and acne).  Casting Mary Kate as her did nothing to help it.  Mary Kate is far from ugly, even in the weird getup.  She didn't do terrible as Kendra, but Kendra's role was greatly reduced from the book, so it's hard to say.  She was a little bit overdramatic.  Will the Tutor is terribly underused.  Because Kyle doesn't want to study in this version, his existence is unnecessary.  Zola the Maid fairs better than her hugely stereotyped Magda.  I even liked how she *wasn't* someone that the book made her to be in the end.  Sloan morphs from popular girl to ""Oh, I'm not so bad, it was just my boyfriend that made me that way"".

But the story is where the book really falls flat.  When you open to a scene where Kyle is running for president and his speech consists solely of ""Vote for me, I'm beautiful"", you know you have problems.  The basic outline is pretty much like the book: Kyle asks Kendra on a date to humiliate her, Kendra curses him, Kyle must find someone to love him.  In between, there are changes, both good and bad.

I wasn't fond of how Linda and Kyle spoke and started ""clicking"" before he changed ""ugly"".  I didn't mind her having a crush on him (she did in the book), but if they had a connection before, it almost deadens the ""He has to learn to fall in love"" lesson.  And makes it look like he would have tried to date her anyway.

I have no idea why Will was brought in.  Kyle wanted to learn in the book and asked his dad for a tutor.  Here, Will shows up and promptly does nothing for the rest of the movie.

Having Kyle stalk Linda before he saves her from the drug dealers was stupid.  Does every teenaged romance have to have stalking now as a sign of love?  And the drug dealers' scene was horribly cheesy.  Although I will admit, it gave a better reason why Linda should stay with Kyle than the book did.

Most of the ""chemistry"" between Kyle and Linda is very sketchy and awkward.

I really hated how Kyle got into a hissy fit about Linda calling him ""a good friend"" and then refused to take her phone calls.  Uh, dude, she's trying to clarify your relationship.  You are *this close* to losing her.  Get over yourself and pick up the %^&*ing phone.

The ""climax"" or end scene or whatever is so dull and boring, it is like dropping a brick on the floor.  *THUD*  Blah.  Whatever.

I could probably go on like this forever (in fact, I wrote a nearly scene-by-scene rant, just to get it out of my system), but I think you get the point.  The movie is definitely not as good as the book (which isn't the best of books to begin with).  I do not recommend a viewing, unless you are a die-hard fan of Alex Pettyfer, Vanessa Hudgens, or Beauty and the Beast.  Or, you are bored and need to get to sleep.

I'm not sure whatever convinced the makers of this film that this fairytale needed to come to the screen as a live-human film, but it was a horrible decision. Worse yet was the script they chose.

It's one thing for a fur bearing, claw-bearing, roaring, ranting animated beast to kidnap and hold prisoner the girl in a cartoon...it's really quite another for a flesh and blood human being. On the one hand, it is so fantastical that you can go with it; on the other, it's just a little too creepy. Add into this that the witch is absurd, the ""beastly"" transformation is laughable, the characters are weak, the dialog is bad, and the rest is only mediocre, and you have a big, bad, beastly waste of time: ""Beastly"".

I would like to say that, to be fair, there were good points to this film...but I honestly can't remember any. The closest I can come is that the main actors seemed higher caliber than their roles here; and that there were some funny moments, few and far between. But, alone in this wilderness of refuse, they seem hardly more than a few points on the horizon.

I have never read the book (nor do I plan to), so I don't know if it's as much of a stinker as this film; the mere fact that it must bear some commonalities, however, to the film is enough to dissuade me from the effort -- there are too many worthy books to waste the time on this.

If you want a sweet, cute piece of fluff to watch on a rainy afternoon, I think you'll like this movie.  It's not worth the time to pick this movie apart and criticize it with more than one paragraph.

Yeah, it's really hard to update Beauty and the Beast - protecting the daughter from drug dealers by hiding her in a house is a weak and unprobable way to keep ""Beauty"" locked away to fall in the love with ""the Beast,"" but seriously, it's 2011, do you have a better idea?

I was interested in seeing this movie because I like the male lead - despite being a young actor, I think he carries (if that's the right word) himself more maturely than other actors his age.  I really liked him in ""I Am Number Four"" so I thought I would give this movie a try.  I also like Neil Patrick Harris in almost any movie and the sarcastic humor his character brought to the table was one of the best parts of ""Beastly.""

Several times in the movie, Lindy (the modern day Beauty) says how she is a sucker for sappy romance.  That is exactly what this movie is...a sappy romance.  But at the same time, it's cute with a happy ending.",1312329600,17,1206,4.277533039647577

This really does not have any resemblance to the classic ""Beauty and the beast"" nor the T.V. program.  Basic story inartistic youth (Alex Pettyfer) is cursed by a snubbed witch to look like repulsive until someone tells him they love him. Naturally he starts changing attitude.  He protects a girl (Vanessa Hudgens) from her rough life and that adds to his recovery.

I have a strange feeling that there will be a sound track.

Watching this movie also brought to my attention that airplanes nowadays don't carry vomit bags.

I rented it, and I was sadly mistaken- the movie took out soo many important parts from the book and I was disappointed, to say the least. The part of the mirror was not in the movie at all, the online chats with Kyle's friends who were like him (mer-man, frog man, etc) was not in the movie at all either, and this was an important part because it helped Kyle deal with his ""transformation"" better than he could have alone, without any moral support. The part with his ex-girlfriend was not in the movie, when she came over to his house and was scared of him because of what he looked like.

The book made Kyle seem that he was a beast- it stated that he was growing hair on his back & arms, and in actuality, he stayed the exact SAME as he was before, only with a disfigured face because of the witch's curse.

I would say this movie is mediocre at best- but definately disappointed that the movie wasn't like the book AT ALL.",1310342400,,1022,4.209183673469388
4041900,2,B002ZG975Q,"A rich, handsome preppie who is the son of a famous newscaster is a living megaphone for his father's callously superficial values: physical appearance and money are all that matter in life, and anyone who has them should rule the world.

I had really liked Vanessa Hudgens in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-School-Musical/dp/B000F2BNW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High School Musical</a>, and I was willing to give newcomer Alex Pettyfer a chance. He certainly looks the part of a gorgeous guy, which is what the hero is supposed to be. It's just too bad that the two of them had to struggle to make something of a hopeless plot.

There have been many retellings of the fairy tale of Beauty and the Beast over the years, but many aspects of it don't translate at all well to a contemporary setting. Yes, the problem of the Beast holding Beauty captive is somewhat solved by having her be at least somewhat willing to be the captive, though she is lied to in order to trick her into being willing by her drug-addict father who basically sells her to Beast (which, of course, is not untrue to the original fairy tale, but again, is very strange in a modern setting). Secondly, it does not make the story more appealing to a modern audience by having Beast stalk Beauty before tricking her into staying with him.

One of the few things the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/book/dp/3833938447/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">book</a>&nbsp;this is based on has going for it is the big reveal at the end as to who the witch truly is and what her motivation for cursing the hero is. Of all the things in the book's plot that needed to be improved on, why pick this one, which was fine? What they did to the witch instead turned the story into pure sap.

Other complaints:

Why would this superficial hero want to run for president of a save-the-earth type club? For that matter, why would any school, especially a prep school, consider such an election worth a school-wide campaign? I could see it as that important if he were running for student body president--but president of a club? What a strange, unrealistic plot choice.

The actor playing the father was not handsome enough to play a character who worshipped beauty, both in males and females.

Turning the hero into a tattooed skinhead instead of how he appeared in the book--as a furry, clawed Beast much like in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Disney-movie/dp/B003DZX44I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Disney movie</a>--and then asking a modern audience to think that would get him a second glance in New York City doesn't make sense to me. Maybe if he were in a small town in the Midwest is might be a problem. But New York? I don't think so.

In the book, the Beast also had strength to go with his new look, which was also something that made sense to me, but in the movie, the Beast has no particular powers at all. He also, unlike in the fairy tale, never does anything noble or sacrificial at all.

The climax scene at the hero and heroine's school was not romantic to me. It made me cringe.

All in all, I have to say I was very glad I saw this on DVD instead of in a theater. The hero is so passive through 99% of the story, I kept falling asleep and eventually got up and did some exercise to keep me awake.",1310256000,3,3400,4.980599647266314

The two leads have about as much chemistry as a dish of soap and a fork. It wasn't there. Vanessa Hudgens's idea of acting is to make ""cute"" faces and stand around staring, trying to look thoughtful or meaningful. There's no explanation of why there's a witch in the school. She's just there and casting spells. Huh? The blind teacher is another loose thread. There he is...but he does nothing except make ""profound"" statements every so often. Of course he has to have a happy ending at the end.

He has one year to get a girl to genuinely tell him she loves him or he will be cursed with bad looks forever. Kyle goes into hiding and while trying to win over the girl that his heart really yearns for, he also learns a thing or two about inner beauty.

Yeah, it's a take on the old Beauty and the Beast story, but it works.  I really enjoyed this one.  Alex Pettyfer plays Kyle.  You might recognize him as the lead from I Am Number Four.  He's good eye candy.  Even when he was the tatted up bald beast, he's still pretty hot.  Mary-Kate Olsen plays Kendra, the witch, and even she was pretty decent and looked great. Vanessa Hudgens plays Lindy, the girl that Kyle falls for.  She wasn't bad either.

I really appreciated her character's back story more than anything.  Her father is a druggie and kills a dealer to save her.  She goes into hiding at Kyle's house for protection and this is how she gets to know him, though she doesn't know its really Kyle from her school, a guy that she didn't really know very well outside is pompous showman attitude.

The real surprise is Neal Patrick Harris, who plays Kyle's blind tutor.  He offers up quite a bit of humor and since he can't judge Kyle by his looks, he teaches Kyle that he shouldn't judge himself in that manner either.

Kyle's father is a popular news anchor and just as stuck up as his son.  When Kyle becomes cursed, he tucks Kyle away in a penthouse in the city.  It becomes obvious that his father is ashamed of him since he keeps canceling plans with him.  The father quickly falls out of the storyline all together as Kyle concentrates instead on breaking the curse by getting Lindy to love him.  This father/son storyline was probably the weakest part of the movie, and I didn't really are that it didn't get wrapped up in the end.

A touch of love.  A touch of whimsey.  Heart. Emotion.  Romance.  The movie has a touch of it all. Its definitely a chick flick though, but good ahem, exposure for Mr. Pettyfer which ain't bad either!",1310169600,2,2271,4.360381861575179

4041915,2,B002ZG975Q,"I rarely watch movies (and have been TV-free for 15 years), but I took exception and saw this, hoping for a modern spin on a beautiful fairie-tale.  I was keenly disappointed in Hollywood's efforts to translate ancient story to present-day production.

First, it is completely unbelievable that a person so verbally horrible to others would be allowed to make the speech he did, without being called on it by school authority of some sort.  Second, it's hard to believe that a son so put off by his own father's behavior would so embrace it - typically the opposite is true, even in cases where desperate desire for paternal love is the case.

Then there's Vanessa H., who has yet to impress me.  She can't sing any better than the other girls out there of her age, is average fare where acting is concerned and the only thing I see that she has going for her is that she's ""eye candy"", to use one of Kyle's phrases.  So does that mean our 'beast' will only fall in love with a sexy lil' thang?  Hardly inspiring, that.  Her character is a 'green freak', but she's chomping on boxed/processed candies, drinking Starbucks-esque lattes and decked out in synthetics while pumping pop/rock into her ears.  Something doesn't quite jive with what they're telling us.  There's actually nothing that sets this heroine apart from her peers - she's social network addicted, constantly on the cellphone, and gives little girly noises when she speaks.  She's drawn to Kyle because 'even though he's wrong, he's real about who he is'.  So beauty, apparently, equates to 'real'.  Good to know - Timothy McVey suddenly is so very beautiful.  Like, no way, and... well, no way.

The tragic hero truly is self-absorbed thru the entire movie, even at the end, when he's supposed to be so changed: he won't return her calls, because *HE* is upset with how things are playing out.  When he's not self-obsessed, he's played as desperate to a painful point - where he has no pride at all.  The extremes don't create a balanced character at all.

Neil Patrick Harris - very funny, completely over the top, though.  He's just unbelievable.  And that's leaving out the 'blind-guy-kicks-arse-at-darts' thing.  Of course tutors would just sit around, twiddling thumbs for months on end, providing snarky dialogue to try to redeem the movie.  Or is he a friend of Kendra's, just waiting for his own curse to be lifted by doing penance babysitting Kyle?  It would've at least added something deeper to the very flat and Disney-imitated plot.

REALLY high on the list of things not to miss are the drug dealers.  Her dad gets in an argument, baddie #1 pulls a gun, Kyle kicks it away, baddie #2 kicks Lindy down a flight of stairs, then both baddies (and Dad) stand staring at each other while Kyle carries her back to her apartment building, returning just in time for Dad to shoot baddie #1.  Dad turns on Kyle, who knocks it away again (!?) and then baddie #2 in his rage and anguish *DOESN'T* do... anything.  Do you think if you were a thug and someone kills your brother and was unarmed, YOU'D just turn tail?  Hardly.

Our witch?  You couldn't slather her with a more dramatic air.  Her curse on Kyle... is ""Embrace the Suck"".  Oh, yeah, that'll do it.  Be sure to add a close-up of her retina to make it seem magical, or it'll fall flat.  Wait, it did, anyhow.  They couldn't decide on a look for her, either, so she goes from vamp to dreds to Pulp Fiction to Fairy Witch-mother... it wasn't coherent or well done.

I don't believe neither of these movie are really good to be honest, acting performance is rather mediocre, and storyline very much boring. But I believe this young actor has potential, I find that he actually make the movie I am number four entertaining. In Beastly, he seems to be acting like he is in a Play, I don't really see him connecting with his character. I believe that he probably was not really comfortable with the role, something I like about his acting in number four is that he is effortless attractive. What I mean, is that he seems not to be that vain, his beauty doesn't distract me from his performance, he seems to behave like the boy next door, and that for me is what make him better over others actors. Is my opinion. In Beastly, he just seems not to fit in the role, the idea that there is a guy that will deliver a speech on how Good looking people are the leaders does not seems to fit really, and don't get to hate his behavior, I feel sorry that somebody actually is that silly to said that out loud.

It happens too suddenly to be realistic, even for a fairy tale. The book goes into much more detail, and while I realize the movie writers couldn't include every for the sake of time, they seemed to have left out key elements. It's always nice to see love triumph over adversity, but if there's no challenge, who cares? I strongly suggest reading the book before, or instead of, seeing the movie.

4041929,2,B002ZG975Q,"There have been other stage plays, musicals and films that recall the old fairytale of Beauty and the Beast and the message they all hold - that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder - is a solid one. BEASTLY, adapted from  a 2007 novel by Alex Flinn, is 'a retelling of the fairytale Beauty and the Beast set in modern-day New York City from the view of the beast. Flinn researched many versions of the Beauty and the Beast story to write her book. Many of these are playfully alluded to in portions of the book, particularly the chat room transcripts in which the character of Kyle talks to other teens who have been transformed into creatures.' Not having read the book may be an advantage or disadvantage depending of how well Miss Flinn placed words in the mouths of her characters.  But writer/director Daniel Barnz adapted the story and the screenplay is an embarrassment.

Kyle (Alex Pettyfer from 'I am Number Four') is a cocky, conceited handsome rich son of a popular television personality who runs for high school office on the platform that looks and social standing and popularity and money are the only important values on which to elect a person to a position: he is a cad who steps on anyone to climb the ladder of accelerated ego. He snubs his opponent Lindy (Vanessa Hudgens) and marches to victory.  At a party Kyle encounters Kendra (Mary-Kate Olson) a ridiculous appearing strange girl who is a witch and puts a curse on Kyle: he will become ugly for a year and only be able to regain his handsome raison d'etre for living if he can find a girl to say she loves him before his year is up. Kyle faces his equally obnoxious superficial father (Peter Krause) who, in horror,  finds an apartment for his now grotesquely ugly son and leaves his housekeeper Lola (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and home tutor, blind Will (Neil Patrick Harris), to care for him.  Kyle attempts to hide himself from the world but with Lola's and Will's advice he returns to the streets at night where he observes a now beautiful Lindy attempting to protect her drug addict father (Roc La Fortune). He follows her, watching her from afar until they finally meet and Kyle allows Lindy to see his ugly beast face expecting Lindy to be repulsed (she is not) and thus begins Kyle's wooing of Lindy to extremes that lead to what we all knew would be the ending of the story.

Alex Pettyfer is a British actor who shows promise and has the looks to make him a teen idol (even with his silly 'beast' paste  on makeup): he deserves better.  Everyone in the cast seems uncomfortable with the oh-so-pop dialogue and the aspects of the film that could have left a worthy message are buried in the mess of the production.

Well, for some reason the scriptwriters decided to take all those things--the most interesting parts of the story, in my opinion, and throw them away.  They obviously had NO IDEA that they were trying to tell an old French fairy tale with lots of tradition behind it, and instead opted to make a boring teen sap flick.  Aside from the curse, virtually all of the magical elements were missing.  The so-called Beast was not even really a beast; they simply made him bald and covered him with tattoos and some scars--hardly anything to earn a second glance in New York City.

But after watching all of the supplements, I saw that there was some sincerity put into the making of this, so I put aside the bad acting (the worst I have seen for several of these competent actors) and questionable writing to just try and get some light entertainment.

The story follows our great looking character as he is smitten with himself but is disfigured to learn the lessons of finding himself and real love. You get your spattering of high school antics being played by post-college grads and adults, culminated with a totally unbelievable love story in a forced situation. The picture quality is not benchmark but does show some strength in the daytime sequences. The DTS also has some nice moments (nightclub scene, some echoes) but most of the surround time is from that soundtrack (love or hate it). The supplements are a mixed bag though:

* Alternate ending, 10:13 minutes. I initially saw this and thought how much better it would have been to keep this grittier and completely different ending in the film - but then the cheesy writer came through in full force to make it have to be cut. Answers the question of where those scenes went we saw in the trailer.
* Deleted scenes, 5 minutes. They are actually like alternate takes, with the hilarious exception of the zoo sequence as it was a verbatim piggyback-from-Twilight copy...barf.
* Classic Tale Retold, 10:06 minutes. A very clip-heavy interview piece about how they brought this story to screen and character analysis by the actors (almost worth the watch for the unintended humor). The clips total more than half of this.
* Creating the Beast, 5:01 minutes. A background on the concepts and make-up for Pettyfer's face.
* Music Video, Kristina and the Dolls, 3:00 minutes. I can tolerate the shaky cam thing fairly well, but when did this earthquake cam thing start (brutally fast vibrational cam)? Irritating.

5.1 DTS English only and subs in same. I was surprised as usually Sony includes a great deal more for languages and subs. Region coded A. 1.5 for the film and 1 for the supplements but I cannot add anything more as this feels like they did not want to put too much effort into it.",1309046400,,2287,4.726817042606516

I'll be honest, I was not looking forward to watching this at all.  As I said in a previous review I am not a fan of the ""Twilight Saga"" and this is another movie geared toward that crowd, much like ""Red Riding Hood"" was.  I was very shocked at how much I enjoyed this one more then the others.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a movie for the ""Twilight"" crowd, but it is not a horrible experience to endure.  Just in case you didn't know this is a version of ""The Beauty & The Beast"" so you know how it turns out, but it is still worth watching.  This movie definantly had it sappy and cheesy moments, but that is to be expected from a movie like this. This movie also teaches a good lesson for the high school crowd, the treat others how you want to be treated idea, and any movie that shows kids that it pays to be nice is a great thing.

There's nothing inherently wrong with that idea, but Beastly is a film which delivers a concept at the expense of...well, everything else. This is one of the most maddeningly incomprehensible films I've witnessed lately; a movie which plays as if a 13-year-old girl and a sentient copy of US Weekly joined forces to write a screenplay via text message based on a trending twitter topic. Admittedly, I'm not the target audience for this film. However, those who dig this sort of thing really deserve better than the sort of half-baked garbage Beastly delivers.

4041945,3,B002ZG975Q,"One for the saps. Maybe it's my recent break-up talking, but I liked this one. It's ultra-romance, where the bad guy realizes the error of his ways, and the poor-girl hot-chick still manages to look pretty and stay smart despite her severe family troubles - but the film knows what it is and doesn't shy away from it. The screenwriter tried to be ""hip"" with the dialogue, creating his own lingo that resembles a sore thumb at times when the actors (young and hip in their own right) stumble on, rather than integrate, the new lexicon.

A highlight is Neil Patrick Harris as the blind tutor, whose frequent one-liners give the film a levity it greatly needs in order to stay away from the ""I love you so much it hurts"" scenario that a film like this always gravitates toward. Also a huge welcome back to Mary-Kate Olsen as the witch. Her outfits are a character all their own.

The plot is simple and stays true to the book. It would be sacrilege to turn Alex Pettyfer into a real beast, so I forgive the producers of the film for playing tame on that account.

The whole teenage wicca curse thing was just plain stupid!!!

How Vanessa's character finds herself living at the Kyle character's same house was bad, bad writing!

Will is a hilarious character and the delivery by Neil Patrick Harris was well done.

The movie ends without the full feel good closure for the supporting characters and the sub-plots introduced with them. That was disappointing.

He openly proclaims people should vote for him because he is good looking and his dad is a celebrity. He has a Barbie Doll girl friend and lives at home with his dad who ignores him. He takes out his lack of fatherly attention on everyone from the maid to the school witch, the later being a mistake. Kendra, the school witch, who can't rig an election (must not be a Chicago witch) portrayed excellently by Mary-Kate Olsen, places a curse on Kyle. Kyle will become as ugly on the outside as he is on the inside. He doesn't become Michael Berryman ugly, more like the lead singer from Midnight Oil ugly. He has one year to find someone who will tell him, ""I Love You"" or else he will stay ugly forever.

Neil Patrick Harris gives us a good performance as his blind private tutor who is more of a philosopher.

When the story succumbs and becomes the Beauty and the Beast it falls apart. Neither actor was good enough to carry the burden of a trite script.

I liked the fact that Beauty (Vanessa Hudgens) wants old fashioned hand written love letters. I thought that died with the younger electric texting generation.

4041951,2,B002ZG975Q,"I can't say the remix did it a lot of good. The story gets off to a shallow start, with pretty much every character acting out some stereotype. Kyle places himself squarely in a cult of personality (his), at the expense of everything that matters. Lindy (charmingly played by Vanessa Hudgens) is the earnest one, working her way up from an unfortunate start - almost a Horatio Alger character, or a character from one of those nineteenth century class-consciousness novels. One of the Olsen sisters showed up in goth drag, playing the part of the witch.

After that, the classic Beauty/Beast story plays itself out predictably: fair maiden held in isolation with The Beast, he trying desperately to break the enchantment. How this happens in modern-day New York (or something similar) stretches credulity, but I'll go along with that much for the sake of the story. The only real additions to the old fairy tale are Kyle's father - as obnoxious as Kyle, but more practiced - and his tutor, who probably shouldn't make me think of Pinocchio's Jiminy Cricket but does.

In the utterly predictable happy ending, true love blossoms. Or, I wonder, was it just Stockholm Syndrome?

Outstanding, if you're a high schooler looking for a shallow, romantic date movie - but I'm not.

4041952,3,B002ZG975Q,"Having read the book and seen the movie within a week, I'm here to say that the movie could have been so much better.

As is often the case, the book is always better than the movie. Often, for reasons unknown, the screenwriters/ directors/ producers decided what is worth keeping from the novel and what isn't. And often it is us the readers who are left disappointed with their vision.

So what left me disgruntled was this:

Why make Kyle refuse to learn in the movie? Part of the beauty of the novel was that Kyle found solace in the beauty of books and learning. I loved that he was able to relate his situation to the dark characters he connected to in classic novels. The book emphasized that Kyle went through a process where he began to care about himself as a person and cultivate his mind. Also, this process truly shows the relationship between him and his tutor and it's a very special one. In the movie- Kyle refused to learn and scoffed at books and tutoring. Not only is it a terrible message to the youth marketed for this film- but it also ruins a substantial part of the depth of this character. In the novel, one really feels that Kyle is becoming a better person by committing himself to education and relating his experience to classic literature. AND because of this new-found love- he is able to relate to Lindy and that is one of the reasons they fall in love. This was IMPORTANT! He reads Jane Eyre for the girl because she asks him too. That was a beautiful metaphor, of course, and it was just totally missed in the film.

Why change the character Sloan? In the book, Sloan was the female version of Kyle. There are essential parts of the book where Kyle learns about love and humanity by realizing that Sloan is superficial and was using him for popularity. Even her role at the end was essential to realizing the growth of Kyle. In the movie, they take Sloan and make her into a victim which just doesn't work. At one point Kyle hears Sloan say that she ""had to be mean"" because she felt Kyle made her that way. This makes Sloan into a nice girl who was forced to torture other people because Kyle forced her too. This just didn't work for me in the plot line. If she really was this nice person under her mean (fake) exterior, then perhaps she would have actually loved Kyle or helped him after his transformation. In the book, she only loves him because he's popular and handsome and when he goes to her, she runs away. This was an important series of events! It was part of his learning process about love and the depth of people. The movie pretty much axed her part and changed her role in the story- therefore taking out another essential slice of the pie.

Why in the world did they change the end of movie?! When I read the book, I found the last pages to be so powerful and amazing. I re-read the ending several times and then sat back, sated, feeling a surge of romantic pleasure. I was really shocked that they removed the best part of the story- which, in essence, was the part that made you, the viewer/reader, realize that Kyle really had ""changed"" and deserved a second chance at life. What he did for his lady love was so amazing and was such a true sacrifice, I just melted! The movie as it is now just ends sorta ho-hum. An anti-climatic reunion at best.

I've read the critic reviews and nearly all of them say this movie isn't good because the transformation of Kyle just isn't believable. The movie seems silly to them because it has no depth. I think the reason why is because all of the parts of the story that showed his growth and depth were removed. I could go on about parts that are missing, but basically the filmmakers just used the shell of the story and didn't include the meat inside. You can't tell a viewer that the beast has evolved simply by telling them it's so. You have to prove it.

I felt the movie was sorta awesome but always fell short of total awesomeness. I had watched the preview to the film at least a dozen times and, in my mind, I had filled in the movie with so much possibility. I was so excited to see the actors take the depth of the novel and really push their limits to showcase this fairy tale as a real modern-day possibility. But I felt they were often holding back. There were some moments I cheered because I felt the real poignancy of the depth of the story... but overall I felt like the actor's were told to be deep but not too deep.

I don't blame this on Vanessa or Alex. I could almost feel them both wanting to do more. So what happened? Can we do so more filming and add in the parts that were missed to make it a real winner?

This really had potential but I suggest you go read the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beastly-Movie-Tie-in-Edition/dp/0061963283/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beastly Movie Tie-in Edition</a>&nbsp;if you haven't had a chance.

Mary Kate was strange but I suppose that was the whole point of her character. I was not a fan of hudgen's background story. I still found it odd that she was staying with Pettyfer.",1526515200,,609,4.258620689655173
