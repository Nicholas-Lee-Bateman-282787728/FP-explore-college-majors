4912688,5,B0060KGSGO,"Great acting.  Sad,loving, & a caring movie.  After seeing the movie you know why it's called Ocean Heaven.  I think every one should see this movie, because you see how the young man deals with life, & how the father, family, deals.  They are the Hero's in this world.",1289174400,4,269,4.428571428571429
4912689,1,B0060KGSGO,"I couldn't identify with Jet Li's character, or the son's character.  The script probably was too realistic to be adequately emotionally charged to warrant watching this movie.",1379808000,,176,5.518518518518518
4912690,5,B0060KGSGO,"Ocean Heaven will stand as one of the most affecting films I have ever seen. Films like this either resonate with you or they don't. For myself, as a single father, the challenge that Sam Wong (Jet Li) is facing would be incredible. I don't even have words when I really think about it. So the story itself is very powerful. But it takes more than story.
This performances given by the cast are so subtle and so brilliant that it really brings the story home. Seeing Jet Li as an actor, without the constraints of an action character limiting his choices, brings a whole new level of respect for him.
I could talk a lot about why this film is so good. But see for yourself.",1378684800,2,673,4.307086614173229

4912692,5,B0060KGSGO,"To see Jet Li, Mr. Hong Kong Martial Arts himself, take on such a loving and compassionate role in this tale of a father's love, made the movie even sweeter. Beautifully portrayed without hype and making assumptions about those with a diagnosis of autism, the movie was just about the greatest love.....a parent for a child.  Awesome!!!",1372118400,2,336,4.894736842105263
4912693,5,B0060KGSGO,The product came in good condition.  This is Jet Li like you've never seen him his performance displays the dramatic ability he is capable of.  In the states he was marketed well but has not been given work that can display his true quality as an actor. In this film though you get it.  The story is powerful and engaging the pace is good as well a performances. Doesn't display autism as an obstacle and show's a true relationship between father and son.  Jet Li's character makes sense and can connect with the concerns a parent of an autistic child would have.,1371081600,4,563,4.490196078431373
4912694,5,B0060KGSGO,"Jet shows his acting chops in this one. He is a single father raising an autistic son. Unfortunately, he is dying and doesn't think his son will be cared for properly when he goes. Get your box of Kleenex and watch this heartwarming story unfold. Jet is wonderful and so is his son and the supporting cast. It's very much worth your time.",1367798400,2,338,4.380952380952381
4912695,5,B0060KGSGO,Really thought the movie was good. Actors did well. It was a touching story of a young man with autism and a dying father that wanted him to learn to be able to care for himself. Makes one think of the importance of bringing up a child to be self sufficient. Even with a disability to the best of our abilities. Love the movie. Many tears. Great ending. Awesome price for such a good movie.,1366675200,2,390,4.213333333333333
4912696,5,B0060KGSGO,"I knew nothing about it before watching. How come I hadn't heard of this? It's a quiet and sentimental Chinese film that fell well under the radar here in the U.S. If you are willing to suspend any cynicism and go with the film, you will cry, as I did. Jet-Li gives a fantastic understated performance as a father with an autistic son. And Wen Zhang, as the son, was so effectively immersed in his role that I had to Google him to make sure he really was an actor. Just great storytelling from Chinese female writer/director, Xue Xiaolu",1363824000,2,536,4.424242424242424
4912697,5,B0060KGSGO,"With Ocean Heaven (at only $3), I've now found two way-under-the-radar Chinese movies at Big Lots (the prior being Zhou Yu's Train). This movie stars Jet Li in a dramatic role as a quiet and humble custodial worker at an aquarium who is raising an adult child with moderate-to-severe autism. Not a single roundhouse kick is delivered, but rather a subtle and touching performance is given by this icon of the martial arts world. The movie is dominated between Li's Wang Xuechang and his son Dafu (well played by Wen Zhang), but also has some nice smaller roles, particularly Wang's neighbor Auntie Chai (Zhu Yuanyuan)and the character Ling (Kwai Lun-mei), a traveling circus clown who befriends Dafu.

The movie is a beautiful story and certainly sheds light into the world of mental disabilities and the ""quiet heroes"" who parent these children. Moreover, it sheds an interesting light on how China deals with these people. Clearly, there is still something of an archaic method of treatment and housing (removal and marginalization) still in place in China, and I hope this movie goes a long way towards a more sympathetic approach to these children.

The movie is at times a bit jumpy with scene transitions lacking clear segues. At barely over ninety minutes, it might be that much has been edited out which might have filled in these gaps in fluidity. There are no deleted scenes, however, so I'm not sure. Taken on the whole however, it was not enough to merit a star demotion because the film's message, beauty, and the studied performances are more important than my picayune issues.

There is a ten minute ""Making Of"" feature that gives some good background into writer/director Xue Xiaolu's inspiration and Jet Li's thoughts on why he chose this role. Additionally, it's interesting to note that the actor who played Dafu did not know how to swim prior to taking the role of a character that spends a good chunk of the movie in the water, or that Jet Li took no pay for the film and has used it as powerful part of his One Foundation charitable organization. It's heartening to see such a noble effort put forth and I hope to see more from Hollywood as well as around the globe. Highly recommended.",1362787200,2,2208,4.774869109947644
4912698,4,B0060KGSGO,"I got this movie knowing there was no martial arts in it, and i thought it was refreshing to see the other side of Jet's talents.  While slow, this movie still hits emotionally as a father trying to prepare his autistic son to be more independent.

Good moral story and it promotes works with autism as well as the works of his charity The One Foundation.",1359590400,,355,4.363636363636363
4912699,5,B0060KGSGO,"Ocean Heaven follows Sam Wong (Jet Li), a terminally ill father, who struggles to take care of and prepare his autistic 21-year-old son, Dafu (Wen Zhang), for the inevitable. Ocean Heaven is a powerful film with superb performances.

The story in Ocean Heaven is simple to follow, yet covers some complex and sensitive subjects. I believe its simplicity will allow many to connect and relate to the story, and this is a big plus. The film is very compelling from beginning to end; we see the ups and downs of this touching father-son relationship. I really enjoyed the ending of the film. The story is complimented by the amazing performances from Jet Li and Wen Zhang; they felt very authentic. The music in this film was also great, especially during the credits.

Overall, Ocean Heaven is an amazing drama with excellent acting and a simple yet touching story. As of 1/11/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, I highly recommend a purchase.",1359504000,4,954,4.846625766871166

4912701,5,B0060KGSGO,"Jet Li most remarkable dramatic acting role to date. As a dying father, trying his best to find the best care for his autistic son Dauf or David in english and trying to help him understand and prepare for his death. The ending song on the credits, was just a touching as the movie. A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Was not heartwarming and touching. It made you think of many parents who are taking care of their autistic,cerebral palsy, down syndrome and etc. children. If we know if any parent that is taking care of children who have mental problems we should lend a helping hand.",1354320000,,577,4.548076923076923

In our current times, we have so many dysfunctional communities which is a reflection of so many dysfunctional families.  Not often do we see an example how a family should function.

4912703,4,B0060KGSGO,"Never seen Jet Li in a performance like this, I barely recognized him, he was amazing in this film. I love the feel of the film, the directing, and acting. Very subtle but very emotional performances. What I love most about this film was the sense of love, community, and support shown by everyone around the father and son. I see way too many films showing the ignorance of humanity, in which humans become the obstacle, making things difficult for the protagonist. Here, the situation is what is difficult but we see humanity shine. I wanted to give everyone a hug. Beautiful.",1353628800,,578,4.676470588235294
4912704,5,B0060KGSGO,"This is a delightful film. It aims to reach people on a poignant level. I'm not so sure that this film would be for Jet Li's typical fan (or the mainstream audience). It's a departure from his action film. It's more drama on a realistic level.. it gives insight into autism. There is no real point to it (like the video game ""The Sims""). But when watching, you just have to get into the emotional experience of the father.. that's how I watched it. I tried to put myself through the eyes of the father.. who ends up feeling hopeless.. and it was heartwrenching at times..

This film showcases Jet Li as a person. He's admirable. He respects the struggles of the ordinary family, particularly the disadvantaged. Having read Jet Li's philosophy, he's a good person and his real persona is larger than life. He is a human being first, actor second imo. This role really brings out the down-to-earth side of JL. I always enjoyed his action movies but his next phase of development seems to be more spiritual and emotional..",1350172800,2,1019,4.5989010989010985
4912705,5,B0060KGSGO,"Great amazing heart warming movie, I was touched by it, Im used to see Jet li as martial artist, but his performance in this film was incredible just incredible.",1344816000,2,161,4.586206896551724
4912706,5,B0060KGSGO,"As the dad of an autistic boy, I was very moved by this film.  I'm not well versed in foreign films nor Jet Li's work, so I was drawn to it simply by the subject matter.  Even though I just happened to stumble upon this DVD, I'm glad I watched it.  It is a beautiful story with authentic acting and very visually appealing.

The most impressive thing about this film is the accurate portrayal of the challenges between a father and autistic child.  The very real fear of who will care for your child after you're gone, the frustrations over your inability to connect with your child and the one way nature of expressed love are all dead on in this film.  Xiao Lu Xue's (Director & Screenwriter) many years of service with autistic children and their families create a true to life account of a Dad and son.

Kudos to Xiao Lu Xue, Jet Li, Lunmei Kwai and all involved in this special movie.",1340928000,11,889,4.351515151515152
4912707,5,B0060KGSGO,"First of all, if this film fails to move you, then you are either not paying attention or made of stone. A typically understated Chinese film that says more with less.

You cannot help be captured immediately by either the father or his son, Dafu. Both excel in their interpretations of their roles.

Beautifully acted and sequenced magnificently. This film truly captures many things Chinese: a parent's love and support for his child; the lengths he'll go to help and support him; the unconditional love; the plain acceptance of fate and life's turmoil however difficult.

What an absolutely gentile character Jet Li plays! Strikingly different from the usual cold, warrior / fighting roles we are accustomed to see him in.

Again, if this film does not tear your insides out, then there must be something wrong or missing!

FIVE STARS!!",1340582400,2,839,4.964285714285714
4912708,2,B0060KGSGO,"When i received the DVD, it looked like not an original one. I don't know if it's a copy only. I don't think I want to buy anything like it in the future",1339372800,,153,3.6666666666666665
4912709,5,B0060KGSGO,"I had no idea this film existed.  I happen to be browsing for a good martial arts flick when I came upon this movie.  I'm not a big fan of dramas or tear jerkers but I sat through it and was quite pleasantly surprised.  A very emotionally stirring movie, yet subtle and underplayed.  I don't see this film as an ""autism movie"" or even a statement on the powerful bond between parent and child, which I'm sure this movie was intended to be.  Its not even a realistic film as most of the characters were too pure to be believed.  I see it as a fairy tale of sorts, but a beautiful one, with spiritually uplifting qualities.  The world we live in happens to be very brutal, hostile, devious, craven and quite frankly makes you weary of life.  Accidentally discovering this film was the momentary antidote that I needed to get over the hurdle of one more day.  You probably won't see people as loving, kind, caring, compassionate as the characters in the film.  But like a good fairy tale, it has the power to move and uplift you just at that moment when you're feeling a little down.  Its symbolic of how you wish people could be like, a kind stranger, a loving parent, caring teachers, generous co-workers and managers, sacrificing relatives.  But they do not exist in the real world.  I've worked in homes for mentally disabled adults and the caregivers are not even remotely like the loving caregivers in the film, not by a long shot!  But it reminds me of the time I was clearing out rubbish in a field and caught a glimpse of something shining.  It was an old 50 cents piece, not valuable but put me in a good mood.  Finding this film was like that, discovering that little gem.  All the good feelings have passed now, but I'm glad to have experienced it.",1337904000,2,1757,4.423676012461059
4912710,5,B0060KGSGO,"I didn't know what to expect from the movie but just having Jet Li in it was enough to warrant a look. Not a typical Li thriller, action, martial arts movie nevertheless I would say his finest performance. As most readers know by now it's a story of a dying father and his sacrificial love for his autistic son.

Well acted by all parties, directed, scored and certainly well written ( close to 14 years) the story conveys the universality of human compassion and sacrifice. It's who we are as humans. Shown without the need to impose any religious rules of order or punishing fearful dogma upon such simple acts of humaneness.",1337558400,2,627,4.598214285714286
4912711,4,B0060KGSGO,"I loved the film, this is jet li's first non martial art movie and its enjoyable and heartfelt. I got into the characters and the ending was good. I recommend the buy. Its a good drama.

The blu-ray is very good Pic Quality, The film only has subtitles no dub. Which is good why would you want to hear some one elses voice over Jet Li's lol...Dont be lazy and let the film go to wast becouse you don't like reading while watching film........

I rate this a 4 as for me its not the best Jet li movie but is still very good.",1336608000,,523,4.019230769230769
4912712,4,B0060KGSGO,"The more remarkable note for this film is that an actor can portray a young man with autism with such perfection.  Actor Wen Zhang plays a 22 year-old with autism.  The role is done so good, that you cannot imagine the young man acting.

Dafu is a pleasant, mild mannered youth who flutters his fingers often, doesn't say too much, has a pleasing smile, and is not capable of taking care of himself.  One thing he exudes expertise is at swimming.

Dafu's father, Wang Xincheng has done everything for his son, since his mother died in what he considers a suicide rather than an accident.  And now, father learns he has terminal illness.  He works at a tourist attraction, Ocean Park with huge aquariums, and as a maintenance man, he takes Dafu to work where Dafu swims along with dolphins, fish, turtles.

With the impending doom, father sours agencies for someone to care for his son when he dies.  He goes down a list of organizations, orphanages, and institutions, but with no success.  What he decides is the need to teach his son some basic home skills, cooking eggs, dressing himself, how to maneuver outside and to make sure he gets off the bus  at the right street.

Although the concept of terminal illness and leaving loved ones behind has been a universal theme in film, this one takes a look at the desperation, determination, and love, to find a home for someone who cannot take care of himself.  If one cannot find a home, be it a pet or person, the thought to take them with you to heaven is a strong option.

The Chinese film is tender, sweet, with a father's love, providing care, life's lessons, and comfort,  all so you can leave the world in peace, knowing one does not suffer.

With beautiful images of the ocean,  animals and aquariums, the plot was simple, and more on the predictable side.  This is a film you can watch with the whole family, including children....Rizzo",1335830400,,1894,4.586309523809524
4912713,4,B0060KGSGO,"I wasn't sure what to think of this film initially. I'd never heard of it prior to seeing the title online, though I was drawn to the fact that Jet Li played the lead role. After reading the description, I decided to take a chance on a film that seemed very out of character for him, and I was glad I did.

For some, this movie might come off as slow and uneventful. But for those who have or know someone who has a special needs child, this movie touches on the most feared situation a parent can imagine: dying and leaving their child to grow up alone in a world that isn't theirs and doesn't understand them.

The movie is about a father (Jet Li), who is the sole caretaker of his autistic adult son. When he learns that he has a terminal illness and has only a short time to live. Horrified by the idea of leaving his son alone, he sets out to teach his son, who he had cared for and pampered his full twenty-one years, to care for himself and understand his surroundings.

Touching moments are strategically mixed in with those of mild humor, and I quickly fell in love with both main characters and the father's plight. As a friend of several families with special needs children, I understand how hard it is to make those around you understand what you as parent must deal with on a regular basis, and how your world is altered in order to give your child everything you feel they need--not only to survive--but to be happy.",1335830400,,1431,4.312267657992565
4912714,5,B0060KGSGO,"After having seen Fearless 6 times, I was surprised at Jet Li's role in this film. Other reviewers have expounded on Ocean Heaven, so I'll add this: Jet Li shows he is capable of a wide range of roles. He seems smaller and frail in this film; I'm not sure if he lost weight for this role, but his character IS dying. Lunmei Kwai does a great job as the son, swimming and acting. Behind all this we have the director, who created a fine film. Art direction is always important to me, and is impressive. Casting is perfect. Hollywood films go for box office receipts so oftentimes miscast big name actors in roles obviously unsuited for them, it ruins the film. I like dialogue with English subtitles. Dubbing would have spoiled it.",1332374400,3,730,4.496240601503759
4912715,5,B0060KGSGO,If you want a movie you can cry along with-then this is for you.  Fantastic performances all across the board.  No English dialog but that does NOT take away from the movie.  Highly recommended.,1330819200,11,194,4.647058823529412
4912716,5,B0060KGSGO,"This has been touted as Jet Li's first starring non-action drama. While that is interesting it is probably the wrong approach to think of Li's past roles before watching this movie.  This is a simple bittersweet realist drama that is a moving cinematic experience because of the earnest performances.  Jet Li's minimalist characterization is the right approach for his character Wang Xuechang and quite different than his action persona.  The director describes Li's character as ""like a man who has become a mother.""  He is described by others in the film as a good man, which he is.  He is doing the best he can with this situation with dogged determination, not with brilliance or luck, but perseverance.  Wang is a maintenance work for an aquarium and had lost his wife fourteen years ago.  He also has complete responsibility of his son Dafu (Wen Zhang: also acts with Jet Li in the later The Sorcerer and the White Snake) who suffers from severe autism.  Wang is also dying from liver cancer and is given around three months to live.

The film stars off inauspiciously.  Wang takes his son out to the ocean to drown him and himself.  This does not work because the son had secretly untied the rope and the son has one special gift in his mostly closed world -- he is an excellent swimmer.  So Wang goes back to his home and work determined to leave his son prepared for his passing while his pains get worse by the day.  At first he tries to find a place where he can leave his son.  But either the institutions are for kids or seniors which the 22-year old does not qualify.  While this proves difficult he also spends time going over simple behaviors like riding the bus, cooking eggs, and spending money so he can have some semblance of a normal life.

While Dafu spends his days swimming in the aquarium tanks he befriends a travelling circus clown and juggler Ling Ling (Kwai Lun-mei: also acts with Jet Li in the later Flying Swords of Dragon Gate; she also sings a song for the film) who also gives Dafu someone else to trust.  But given that her life is nomadic and that Wang's life is slowly ebbing away you are left to wonder what is going to happen to Dafu.

This is Xue Xiao-lu's first directed film.  Her only other screen credit is for the writing on Chen Kaige's Together.  Xue has stated she has worked on this project fourteen years, referring to her volunteer work with autistic children, and by the time the screenplay got to be read by Jet Li it was in its seventh draft.  What is impressive is the crew that was put together for this film.  For the cinematography you have Christopher Doyle (In the Mood for Love, Rabbit-Proof Fence, Hero), for the music you have Joe Hisaishi (Kikujiro, Spirited Away) and production design by Yee Chung-man (Tokyo Raiders, Shaolin).  Having this triumvirate is quite unbelievable considering the modest budget. Their collaboration helps the film immensely in sound and image.

This is a beautiful looking film.  The cinematography and production design is dominated by blue hues throughout as a constant allegory to the water in their lives. The acting from Li and especially Wen is quite good.  There relationship is quite touching as is the relationship between Dafu and Ling Ling.  That one is underplayed, but I think that is the right decision for this film.  So much of the success of this film depends on how Wen portrays his character's interactions with these two.  There are no magical solutions to the familial issues, just a lot of hard work from caring people.  There are no real antagonists in this story.  Some might consider this a negative, but the movie does not need it.  I am glad, because Dafu's life is difficult enough and the movie is emotional enough.  I had to watch it in two sittings because the first half depressed me quite a bit.  I do recommend this movie and hope those who are on the fence about watching this to give it a watch.  I think it is quite a good film.

There are certainly some parallels between this film and Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung's Heart of Dragon.  Both films were dramatic roles dealing with a caretaker having no choice in dealing with a mentally challenged relative and both were popular action stars getting a chance to expand their acting repertoire.  This film also reminds me of Zhang Yang's underrated Shower in which the relationship between Er Ming and Liu parallels that of the two main characters here.  There is also a water motif present in both films though I think the allegory is stronger in Shower and more matter-of-fact here.  I mention these films because both are interesting and different approaches to similar matter.  Shower is also one of my favorite films.

I saw this on the R1 Well Go DVD release.  But there is also a R1 BD/DVD combo available from Well Go which should have the same extras.  For the extras there is an 11 minute ""Making of"" extra which has interviews from Jet Li, Kwai Lun-mei, Wen Zhang and Xue Xiao-lu and inserted footage from the movie.  It has some good information, but is ultimately too short.  There is a trailer and a teaser for the movie as well.  The start-up trailers (not accessible by menu) are 1911, The Stool Pigeon and The Man From Nowhere. I found a mistake in the description on the back cover which uses names for the two characters (Sam and David) that appear nowhere in the film and there is no English dub so I am not sure where they came from.  The two dubs for this are a Mandarin 5.1 Dolby and a Mandarin Dolby Stereo. There is also an R3 Edko release of this film that came out in 2010.",1330646400,29,5577,4.568982880161128
4912717,5,B0060KGSGO,"I just loved this movie, although I must admit up front that there are few Jet Li movies I don't like! A definite departure from the martial arts genre for Jet Li in this touching, sad, moving and emotional drama of a father trying to help his autistic son gain some independence before the father dies. It was hard not to invest yourself in Jet Li's character. Jet Li's performance is understated but amazing and I really hope he adds more dramas like this to his repertoire of movies as well as his more usual martial arts films. The guy who played the autistic boy also did a very, very good job in his part. I like Jet Li in dramas and he also did an outstanding job in The Warlords with Andy Lau and Takeshi Kaneshiro. I recommend Oceans Heaven.",1329523200,12,750,4.326241134751773
4912718,4,B0060KGSGO,"Wang Xingchang (Jet Li) is a terminally ill middle-aged man working at an aquarium in Qingdao. Having lost his wife, taciturn Wang is living with an autistic son, 21-year-old Dafu (Wen Zhang), about whose fate he is very anxious. Wang spends his last days trying to find a place for his son to live after he is gone, while patiently teaching him necessary skills in life (like how to ride a bus), but new experiences are not always welcome to Dafu.

Though there are several supporting characters, including Ling Ling (Lunmei Kwai), a clown of a traveling circus visiting the aquarium), the film focuses the father-son relationship between Li's and Zhang's characters. It works, because of the superb acting from the leads, which gives credibility to the simple storyline.

The film is written and directed by Xiao Lu Xue (co-writer of Kaige Chen's 2002 drama ""Together""). Xiao Lu Xue (her feature debut), it is reported, based her script on her experiences at the educational institute for autistic children where she had worked as a volunteer. ""Ocean Heaven"" also benefits from Christopher Coyle's beautiful photography with masterful use of light and shadow, as well as the music from Jo Hisaishi (Hayao Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away."") The location of the seaside city of Qingdao is a plus.

""Ocean Heaven"" is Jet Li's first purely dramatic role. Here Li delivers a strong performance as a selfless father, but ""Ocean Heaven"" is more than just a proof of his acting abilities, which is considerable. The film deals with several serious issues without becoming depressing or patronizing, and it succeeds. Worth watching if you are not a Jet Li fan.",1319500800,,1647,5.0036496350364965

In this case, he plays the amazing role of an aging father dying from liver cancer that is trying to find a solution, someone to care for his adult autistic son after his death. The movie touched me at so many levels. Our ethnocentricity often suggests that autism is an American disease.
