6141936,5,B00H9BFVH0,My son loves these movies. I just wish they came on one disc so you wouldn't have to switch discs after 20 minutes.,1411603200,7,115,4.043478260869565

6141939,5,B00H9BFVH0,Kids love them. Play them several times.,1465344000,,40,4.857142857142857
6141940,1,B00H9BFVH0,Horrible doesn't work on regular DVDs players only DVD players that specifically play region 2. And it shipped from Great Britain so shipping back a return cost more than the DVD.,1462406400,,179,4.806451612903226
6141941,3,B00H9BFVH0,Very choppy plots. Don't match the original movies. The super hero ones are so much better.,1456790400,,91,4.75
6141942,4,B00H9BFVH0,"My son loves these movies. They have some humerous moments for the adult Star Wars fan watching the movies. The stories are entertaining. If you've got Legos it definately helps inspire the kids to build, which is great. My only complaint is that it's three discs packaged together. I sort of assumed that it would be all four movies packaged into one disc, particularly since each movie is only about 20-25 minutes long.",1456185600,,421,4.780821917808219

6141944,5,B00H9BFVH0,My Grandchildren are extremely thrilled; they feel they have to cover their eyes during the combats. I'm pleased as well with the clearness of visual and audible presentation.,1454803200,,175,5.285714285714286

6141946,5,B00H9BFVH0,Very cute and great for smaller kids. It's three separate dvd's and each one is fairly short (just long enough for their attention span) and age appropriate for my 6 year old.,1454544000,,175,4.5
6141947,1,B00H9BFVH0,Caution USA customers!  This DVD will NOT play on our standard players!  It is for a European player.,1453507200,,101,4.555555555555555

6141952,1,B00H9BFVH0,"Picture showed figures all together. My daughter received it & little bags with some pieces missing, but also bigger bag & she will have to go thru everything to try to find extra pieces. I've received Legos before $ they were in packs separately but all pieces with it completed figures. She was  not satisfied, but kept it.",1447027200,,325,4.603448275862069

6141964,5,B00H9BFVH0,Grandson was thrilled as it is not available in Mexico where he lives.  Equally enjoyable for a 3 year old and a 68 year old,1426291200,2,124,3.96
6141965,5,B00H9BFVH0,"My 5 year old Star Wars fan loves these ""silly"" movies and so do my husband and I.  They are cute and funny and a nice length (about 20 minutes each).  I am glad that we got the set with several  of them since they are short enough that we can watch 2 together but not so long that it is a real movie length.",1425686400,2,308,3.707692307692308
6141966,5,B00H9BFVH0,"Padawan Menace is 5 stars - laugh-out-loud funny. It is out on blu and I would recommend that version, which is much cheaper for a set of blu+dvd. Empire Strikes Out gets a 4.5, first of all for the title and for some very funny moments. The Yoda Chronicles gets a 3 - it seems to run out of steam on the satire and focus on the story, which is OK, but does not have the brilliant writing of the first two. They must have changed writers - I didn't look, but I will. You do not need a child or a grandchild to buy this. Mine are 'too old' to watch it. If you are a fan of SW, Clone Wars, Rebels, etc., you will have fun with these.",1424908800,7,631,3.8615384615384616

8631125,5,B00H9BFVH0,"A three-pack that lovingly pokes fun at everyone's favorite space opera and would fit in perfectly with other Star Wars parody sets? What's not to love? Though seeing this was a Walmart exclusive I wouldn't pay more than $22 for this set which is just the previous LEGO Star Wars specials repackaged into one case with each special clocking in at 22 minutes.

This three-pack will make a fine addition to your Star Wars home video collection and good to get if you held out on buying the individual releases.

P.S. If you buy this pack then I recommend also picking up ""The New Yoda Chronicles"" which continues the story started in ""The Yoda Chronicles"" and contains a few references to ""Padawan Menace"" and ""Empire Strikes Out"" as well as ""Droid Tales"" for a LEGO spin on 1-6 with a cameo by the Rebels cast.",1516665600,,809,4.572413793103448
