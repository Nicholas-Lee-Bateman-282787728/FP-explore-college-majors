SURVIVOR SERIES 2011

1.[US TITLE]DOLPH ZIGGLER VS JOHN MORRISON-this was a great opening match as are all of Dolph's matches on PPV it seems. I think this guy has come a long way and he is a future Champ and main eventer for real. Morrison was good here as well as both put on a quick paced match with back and forth action. Of course as other reviews have stated the crowd wanted Zach Ryder here against Ziggler and made it known. Regardless this is a great opener and the people get what they want after Ziggler wins and Ryder hits the ring.

2.[DIVA'S TITLE LUMBERJILL MATCH]BETH PHOENIX VS EVE-any time Beth is in a match I am interested because she is one of the few Diva's I actually enjoy watching. She always comes to put on a good show regardless who her opponent is. Here she battles Eve who gives her a pretty good match, liked her submission attempt. Still Beth delivers a vicious Glam Slam for the win, excellent ending.

3.[TRADITONAL SS MATCH]WADE BARRETT, CODY RHODES, DOLPH ZIGGLER, JACK SWAGGER, HUNICO VS RANDY ORTON, SHEAMUS, KOFI KINGSTON, SIN CARA, MASON RYAN-my favorite thing about this event, in fact the name of the event is based on this match. I truly miss the days when all the matches were these elimination matches. It pit rivals against each other without the threat  of losing titles which added to the story line and worked into the next PPV. Any this match here is the only one of its kind on the card which is a shame because despite all the talent involved it comes off a bit lacking. Don't get me wrong this is not a horrible match but you can tell they wanted more out of it and just couldn't get some things to click. Still it does have it high spots and good moments and Wade along with Cody being the winners was the right way to end it.

4.[WORLD TITLE]MARK HENRY VS BIG SHOW-now a lot of people have hated on this match saying it was slow and not as great as their previous bout. Well for me personally I enjoyed the fact that they gave us a different kind of match. Slow, maybe but there were some really good moments here, Big Show surprised a lot of people here. The match ends with a DQ win for Show and he does to Henry what Henry had done to him. This was a good match and continued the story between the two.

5.[WWE TITLE]ALBERT DEL RIO VS CM PUNK-the best match of the night most likely with two of the best guys in the company in my opinion. Both of these guys are great and put on a great match. There are near falls and close calls for both guys. I like the back and forth action and the way they both work together. Plus it is always cool to see The Fink come out and announce for someone, really cool moment. Del Rio of course works Punk's arm over here setting up his submission finisher but it is Punk that wins by way of submission. After he wins the belt he leaps into the crowd for a cool celebration.

6. JOHN CENA, THE ROCK VS THE MIZ, R-TRUTH-this was the match everyone was looking forward to because the Rock was returning. The thing here of course was could he and Cena get along against two of the best heels in WWE today. Honestly this match was to put over their upcoming Mania match but I think Miz and Truth really did a great job here. They all really put Rock over here as Cena is the one that mostly gets beat on. Even still the action is good throughout with Miz and Truth looking great as a team. Of course we all knew how it would end, with Cena and Rock winning and then Rock laying Cena out at the end.

You get a CM Punk interview as the special feature on the DVD so that was cool. Over this was a good event but it is not a classic like many of the past ones have been. Still for any fan out there this is a good purchase so I recommend it. Let's see what these two will do at Mania, Cena and Rock that is.",1327190400,,3796,4.183310533515732
4834322,4,B005M9VSJ6,"United States Champion Dolph Ziggler vs. John Morrison - From the start of the match, the MSG crowd made it very vocal who they wanted to see as the challenger in this match instead of Morrison.  This match had tons of back & forth action with some standout highlights like Morrison's trademark leaping side kick off the second rope & corkscrew dive over the top rope before Dolph was able to hit Morrison shortly afterwords with a neckbreaker, both men trading sleeper holds, an impactful swinging DDT, the fameasser, and of course Vickie Guerrero's involvement.  Great opener but what made the audience pop more than anything else was who made an appearence after the match.

Lumberjill Match: Divas Champion Beth Phoenix vs. Eve Torres - As expected in a lumberjack match, the people on the outside did get involved as Beth was thrown in when she was dropped onto the outside while Natayla did try to get involved from the floor.  Both girls started off strong with Beth easily dropping Eve with a slam before Eve showed some strength of her own dropping Beth with a clothesline while later applying a unique octopus submission before Beth retaliated with the biggest (and highest) Glam Slam ever seen.  This was good quality for a divas match.

Elimination Match - Team Orton vs. Team Barrett: Randy Orton, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Sin Cara, Mason Ryan vs. Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, Hunico - This was the traditional elimination tag match that had some good quality action with various highlights like the very first elimination, what happened to Sin Cara, Mason Ryan showcase of strength & the crowd's reaction to the showdown between him Cody Rhodes, Sheamus not being able to control his temper, and Randy Orton fighting the odds.  This was a good match but always seemed to keep the same pace throughout most of the match.

World Champion Mark Henry vs. Big Show - Before the match, they showed the ring crew re-enforcing the ring due to what happened at Vengeance.  The MSG was again very vocal showing that they haven't forgotten their history when it comes to Mark Henry's career.  Both men tried to show off their strength by knocking each other off balance before Show surprised Henry with some wrestling moves including an armdrag that knocked Henry out of the ring.  The crowd was getting restless to the point where they were chanting for various people including the one guy who's been involved in this feud for weeks on SmackDown causing Henry & Show to respond with some moves of their own like a DDT & W.S.S. before both men were put through the ringside barricade.  Big Show continued to do moves that we don't typically see from him including a superkick & an elbow drop from the top rope (yes, you read that right).  With Henry being out matches here, he resorted to dirty tactics to retain his championship but the bigger story was how Big Show kept his promise in that Mark Henry wasn't walking out of the ring.  This wasn't like their previous match at Vengeance as this was very slow at some parts with the only thing that would standout here is Big Show dropping a very ""Savage"" top rope elbow.

WWE Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. C.M. Punk - C.M. Punk brought out his own personal ring announcer in Hall Of Famer Howard Finkel while  The MSG crowd once again was very vocal as they chanted things in favor of Punk such as ""We Want Ice Cream"" & ""Colt Cabana.""  Punk was in control during the first half of the match working over Del Rio's arm & even doing a suicide dive onto the outside at one point before Ricardo Rodriquez got involved for Del Rio to get the advantage & worked over Punk's arm with various armbars.  Both men wrestled hard & were able to keep countering & kicking out of each others signature moves like the G.T.S. into a backstabber & Del Rio later doing the same move to Punk's arm, Rio kicking out of Punk's savage elbow drop, Punk going for the G.T.S. another time only for it to be reversed into the cross arm breaker.  This was the match of the night & stole the show.

The Rock & John Cena vs. The Miz & R-Truth - As eluded in the opening video package, The Rock makes his in-ring return to WWE for the first time since 2004 at WrestleMania XX at the same event he debuted 15 years earlier...with both occasions happening in the same building of Madison Square Garden.  John Cena was heavily booed from the moment you heard the first note in his song while you clearly saw the tension between him & Rock as The Rock completely ignored Cena from the time he made his way to the ring to the start of the match.  Rock was in control early to the point where the crowd was chanting ""You Still Got It!"" but problems once again arouse between Cena & Rock with Cena accidentally distracting the referee from Rock's pin followed by the ""tag"" between both men.  ""You can't wrestle"" was yelled to Cena who responded by out-wrestling the Miz only to get the reaction of ""You Still Suck!""  Cena turned his attention for a moment to Rock that allowed Miz & Truth to take advantage with Miz hitting an impactful DDT while both kept Cena away from being able to make a tag including Truth & Rock getting into it on the outside while causing Rock to get into the ring allowing double teaming behind the referee's back at various points.  The hot tag was built to Rock who continued to dominate & ""lay the smackdown"" to victory but the bigger story was after the match when him & Cena had their face to face confrontation.  This was a old school type of tag team match that featured the heels doing various double teams behind the referees back while Cena would be the one taking a majority of the offense & building up to the eventual hot tag allowing Rock to look strong here.

In the end, this was a strong Survivor Series as their wasn't a bad unwatchable match (Show/Henry had it's decent moments) with the typical New York/Madison Square Garden crowd making the night more entertaining than we would get from a normal crowd.  The only thing I would say got annoying was the heavy amount of Twitter references throughout the show as that's the latest media venture that they want to shove down our throats but past that, definitely a good showing from this year that's worth checking out.",1323129600,,6258,4.573345259391771
4834323,4,B005M9VSJ6,"For the most part, this show will be remembered for the Rock returning to MSG, and not much else.  It's a subpar wrestling show, and an outstanding entertainment event.

United States Title
Dolph Ziggler w/ Vickie Guerrero vs. John Morrison:
I don't know what genius decided to leave Zach Ryder out of this match when the show was in NYC and they have been brewing a feud between Ziggler and Ryder for weeks.. Nonetheless, as usual Morrison and Ziggler put on an outstanding match as probably only the two of them could do.  Great opener, and a HUGE pop for Ryder when he runs out at the end.

Diva's Title Lumberjill Match
Beth Pheonix vs. Eve:
The lumberjill concept sucked, but Eve and Pheonix always put on above average diva matches.  The ending was pretty cool too, with another huge reaction from the crowd.

Survivor Series Elimination Match
Barrett, Rhodes, Ziggler, Swagger & Hunico vs. Orton, Sheamus, Kingston, Sin Cara & Mason Ryan:
For the second straight PPV, Ziggler is booked in two matches after Christian was injured weeks before the match.  Orton FINALLY loses one of these matches, in a long, run of the mill, yet satisfying elimination match.  Nothing to go out of your way to see, but still pretty strong.

World Heavyweight Title
Mark Henry vs. Big Show:
This was a horrible waste of money, talent, and air time.  The match is SUPER slow paced.  Seriously, these guys move around like hermits with no athletic ability whatsoever.  The ending is an even harder slap in the face with a terrible DQ finish.  I just hope these guys are not around when the main event for WM comes along.

WWE Title
Alberto Del Rio vs. CM Punk:
Leaps and bounds better than the World Title Match.  Punk has Howard Finkel come out to do his introduction, which was a moment in its own.  The match between these two was phenominal, and the crowd was electric the entire time.  Easily the best match on the night.

The Rock & John Cena vs. The Miz & R-Truth:
This main event was like no other.  While the wrestling was just average at best, the crowd reaction for the Rock was simply amazing.  The audience BOOed everything Cena did- each time he got a tag or did any move, the audience hated it.  A predictable ending but most definitely the most entertaining moment WWE has seen in a long time.  Can't wait to see their match at WM.

This PPV and MSG was great.  The crowd was LOUD the entire time.  There were even some funny/memorable backstage segments.  I would recommend for the entertainment value alone.",1322179200,6,2511,4.599099099099099
4834324,4,B005M9VSJ6,"I attended this show live, so this review is from a slightly different perspective than the others for this DVD.  Live this was a very good show, mostly for the crowd reactions and because the Rock was simply tremendous.  He didn't do a whole lot, but what he did was great, and simply being there made the show worth while.  Nobody who attended this show live or purchased the event on Pay Per View spent their money to see anything or anyone but the Rock, and his appearance was going to make or break the show.  In this case, The Rock made the show.  The undercard was what it was; I've been to many shows with much better wrestling but what was here was fine.  Both the opener and the WWE championship match were very good matches, and the main event was good because of the atmosphere and Rock just being there.  I would recommend buying this dvd just to own a piece of the Rock and Madison Square Garden, and the rest of the show isn't bad either.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1.  United States Championship Match
Dolph Ziggler (c) vs. John Morrison

Crowd absolutely hated Morrison, but mostly because they wanted to see Zach Ryder in this match instead.  Loud chants of ""WE WANT RYDER"" throughout, but it didn't hurt the match and both guys actually played it up well (well, Ziggler did anyway).  Very good match here with lots of back and forth action and near falls.  Nothing you haven't seen from these two before, but they play off each other well and they had a strong match.  Ziggler won clean after hitting the zig-zag.  After the match Ziggler taunted the crowd, which of course led to Ryder coming out to an absolutely enormous reaction, and he laid out Ziggler much to the crowd's delight.  This was a great way to start the show.  ***1/2

2.  WWE Diva's Championship Lumberjill Match
Beth Phoenix (c) vs. Eve

Not horrible per divas match standards but the crowd was completely dead.  The lumberjills meant absolutely nothing and were just there to get some face time on ppv.  Finish was great however with Beth hitting the glam slam off the second rope for the win, which the crowd went nuts for.  Other than that there's nothing much to see here, but not bad by any means.  *1/2

3.  Traditional Survivor Series Tag Team Match
Team Barrett (Wade Barrett, Cody Rhodes, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, & Hunico)
vs.
Team Orton (Randy Orton, Sheamus, Kofi Kingston, Sin Cara, & Mason Ryan)

Long, basic Survivor Series tag match.  I wasn't particularly blown away by this, and the wrestlers seemed to be at a loss when Sin Cara botched a dive to the outside and hurt his knee (he's projected to miss 6 to 9 months), but there was certainly nothing wrong with it and it had a good finish.  It came down to Orton against three of the heels, Cody Rhodes, Wade Barrett, and Hunico.  Orton eliminated Hunico with an RKO as Hunico came off the top, which everyone saw coming but still looked really cool.  However, in a real surprise, Barrett hit the wasteland on Orton right afterwards for the clean win.  Barrett and Rhodes really needed to look strong here and this was certainly the right finish.  Match was better than average but never really seemed to jump to that next level.  **1/2

4.  World Heavyweight Championship Match
Mark Henry (c) vs. Big Show

This was an awful match with one really good near fall and a terrible finish.  Their last match together at Vengeance was shockingly good.  This wasn't that match.  Minutes felt like hours here and the crowd was trying desperately to entertain themselves.  I distinctly remember chants of ""DANIEL BRYAN,"" UNDERTAKER,"" and especially an enormously loud ""BORING"" chant.  Both guys seemed to take forever to do anything.  However, after Mark Henry speared Big Show through a barricade the crowd seemed to liven up, and Big Show actually went up top and hit a flying elbow for a great near fall.  Show took about 4 hours to steady himself on the top, and you could tell he was (rightfully) scared as hell to be up there at his age and weight with all his injuries.  However, right after this, Henry kicked Show low for the blatant DQ, which after a bad match, the crowd was not pleased with at all.  After the match show laid out Henry with the KO punch and pillmanized his ankle, just like Henry had done to Show back in July.  Henry refused a stretcher job and that was that, meaning THIS FEUD MUST CONTINUE.  3/4*

5.  WWE Championship Match
Alberto Del Rio (c) vs. CM Punk

Before the match started CM Punk had Howard Finkel do his ring introduction, which was a really awesome moment and MSG exploded for Finkel, which brought him near tears.  I've been a fan of Howard for a long time and never understood why someone as talented as he is at what he does would be replaced, so this was a very special moment and you could tell it meant a lot to him.  This was the match of the night in my opinion.  It started off slow but built well and there were a lot of near falls at the end.  Alberto kept working on the arm but Punk would find a way out of it and battle back.  Eventually Punk scored a near fall after a kick to the head, and after Del Rio kicked out he locked in the Anaconda vice for the clean submission, and the roof absolutely came off Madison Square Garden, just a huge reaction.  Punk had a great victory celebration afterwards as he leaped into the crowd and everyone was going nuts.  Really good match overall, hopefully Punk can enjoy a relatively long reign as champion.  ***3/4

6.  The Rock & John Cena vs. The Miz & R-Truth

The reaction the Rock received when he came out rivaled anything I've ever heard at a sporting event, period.  The building was literally shaking.  They did stare-downs to start things off, and Rock started the match on the offensive by hitting several lightning-fast arm drags and a magistral cradle for a near fall.  Words don't do justice to how awesome this action was.  On this night, Rock was in a class all by himself, and he made Cena look pretty horrendous in comparison.  Speaking of Mr. Cena, New York did not care much for him on this evening (large understatement).  Conservatively, I would say 90% of the crowd absolutely despised him, but not in the usual way.  Usually it's a good thing and gets a lot of heat for his matches, but in this case it was a legitimate hatred, to the point where they didn't even want him to be there, because he was simply getting in the way of the Rock.  After Rock tagged Cena in the match, Miz and Truth proceeded to get the heat on him for what seemed like days.  Everything Truth and Miz did looked good and they gelled well as a team, but as I said before, all this was simply getting in the way of the Rock and nobody cared one bit.  Eventually Cena was able to make the tag to the Rock and the place wept with joy as he cleaned house and put Miz in a sharpshooter.  Truth broke this up, but Cena slid in and tackled Truth to the outside, allowing Rock to hit the spinebuster and the people's elbow for the win.  Afterwards, Rock and Cena took turns going on the turnbuckle as Rock would receive massive ovations and Cena would be booed unmercifully.  This led to Rock hitting a Rock Bottom on Cena, which Cena sold quite horribly I might add, and that was the end of the show.  To me, this was exactly what it needed to be.  They didn't want to do too much before Wrestlemania, so as far as a tease goes I think this was very good.  They didn't let Rock do too much, what what he did do was excellent and athletically he's one of the better performers I've seen.  As far as the match, they probably got the heat on Cena for too long but in the end it really didn't matter because they people got what they wanted, and that's what wrestling is all about.  ***

This was a very enjoyable, entertaining show live.  As I said I've been to shows with far better wrestling top to bottom, but that really wasn't the purpose or goal of this show.  That being said, the undercard is pretty good for what it is, highlighted by the strong opener and WWE Championship Match.  The main event is certainly memorable and worth checking out because of the crowd reactions and the Rock's performance, and for that I recommend buying this dvd.",1321920000,14,8212,4.433155080213904
4834325,4,B005M9VSJ6,"For so many years, many upon many memorable moments occured at Survivor Series and for the third time it comes to us from the World's Most Famous Arena, Madison Square Garden its the 25th WWE Survivor Series and tonight we see if CM Punk can dethrone Alberto Del Rio, also who will win the 5 on 5 Survivor Series match between Team Barrett and Team Orton and can the Rock & John Cena co-exist and turn back the challenge of The Miz & R-Truth?

-United States Championship Match, Dolph Ziggler (Champion) w/Vickie Guerrero vs. John Morrison: The crowd before and during this match was chanting ""We Want Ryder"" and this was a good opening match though hardly anything new. Morrison used his quickness and unique offense to keep Dolph off his game, including a nice twisting splash over the top rope, but after being distracted by Vickie, Dolph hits a twisting neck breaker and takes over targeting the neck. He continues to hit big moves but John won't stay down for three and the crowd will not let up on the Ryder chants, John had Ziggler beat but Vickie puts Dolph's foot on the rope and the ref kicks her out. There's more back and forth action, Morrison goes for Starship Pain but Ziggler gets his knees up and after the Zig Zag Dolph pins him for 3. 7/10, Ziggler cuts a promo then Zack Ryder's music hits and he beats up Dolph who runs away.

-Lumberjill Match for the Diva's Championship, Beth Phoenix (Champion) vs. Eve: Its the typical and bad Diva's match, with the crowd not reacting much until the end. Eve tries to avoid Beth and pull out a sudden win, though she did hit a unique octopus submission into a triangle choke. Beth uses her power moves and hits a huge Glam Slam off the top to retain her title. 3/10, not a very good match but the finish was worth a couple points.

-The Rock is backstage and cuts a long promo talking about his history in MSG including his debut, his rise in the business before addressing Awesome Truth and his tag partner John Cena, which while funny was just too long.

-5 on 5 Survivor Series Elimination Match, Team Barrett: Wade Barrett, Jack Swagger, Dolph Ziggler, Cody Rhodes & Hunico vs. Team Orton: Randy Orton, Sheamus, Sin Cara, Mason Ryan & Kofi Kingston: One of the few matches with some great build-up as each guy got some good moves in and the expected eliminations take place. Dolph and Kofi start out with plenty of good counter wrestling, then Orton gets the tag hits the RKO and Ziggler is gone. Randy attacks the rest of team Barrett on the outside, then Kofi & Sin Cara hit dueling dives to the outside and Cara is down with an injury and he is eliminated cause he can't continue.

Cody and Mason face off and the crowd cheers big for Rhodes, after a tag Hunico comes in then Kofi gets launched into the ring post for two. Mason throws Hunico around, after a blind tag from Cody, Mason gets hit with the Cross Rhodes and Ryan is gone. Sheamus comes in and gets beaten up by Wade on the outside, then Sheamus gets the tag to Kofi who hits some good kicks, but Wade hits Wasteland and Kingston is gone.

After Randy gets launched to the outside, Cody beats him down until Orton hits a big slam then Sheamus hits the ring and destroys Swagger then hits lots of knees in the corner but he doesn't break the 5 count of the ref and Sheamus gets DQ'd. Sheamus is angered and hits a big kick on Jack and leaves the ring, Randy comes in and covers Swagger and he is gone. Its 3 on 1 and Cody kicks down Orton in the corner but Randy makes his comeback, Hunico tags himself in, jumps off the top rope but gets an RKO and he's gone. Orton hits an RKO on Cody but gets caught in Wasteland and gets counted down for three and Team Barrett survives. 9/10.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match, Mark Henry (Champion) vs. The Big Show: After the ring imploded during their last match at Vengeance, the ring crew was re-inforcing the ring to prevent this from happening again. There's some actual wrestling from Show including a couple of arm drags but the pace rarely picks up much after that. The crowd is very vocal chanting for Daniel Bryan, Henry, Undertaker throughout the whole match, though the best was the loud boring chant. Mark tries working on Show's leg with a leg lock and later Show hits a top rope elbow drop that brought a big Randy Savage chant from the crowd. Later Show has the advantage but Henry hits a low blow and the ref calls for DQ. 5/10. Afterwards Henry goes to break Show's leg again but he moves out of the way. Show is angered, hits the knockout punch then puts a chair over Mark's leg and does a leg drop and Henry can't stand up and he has to be carted out of the arena.

-Wade Barrett is being interviewed backstage before being interrupted by Awesome Truth and they say they will beat John Cena & The Rock tonight. Nice funny comments from Truth like usual.

-WWE Championship Match, Alberto Del Rio (Champion) vs. CM Punk: Loved how they had Howard Finkel introduce CM Punk and the crowd cheered big for The Fink who seemed awe-struck by the reaction. Good one here with Punk getting a huge reaction from the crowd and these two always mixed together well when they faced off. Del Rio works on Punk's arm to set up for the arm breaker, while Punk hits his usual moves. There was good counter wrestling and Del Rio slapped on the Cross Arm Breaker at one point but Punk fights to the ropes to break the hold. Ricardo interferes but gets knocked off the apron, Punk ends up locking on the Anaconda Vice out of nowhere, Del Rio tries to claw at the face of Punk to break the hold but he ends up tapping out and Punk wins the title. 8/10. Nice post match celebration by Punk where he dives into the crowd a couple of times.

-Awesome Truth vs. John Cena & The Rock: The crowd pops huge for Rock and of course really boos Cena everytime he got in the ring or tried to help his team at all. This was honestly a fairly expected and lukewarm match, Rock got some offense in but Cena did a good portion of the work and got beat up by Miz & Truth for a few mins. Once Rock got the hot tag he took it to both Miz & Truth, beating Truth in the corner, hitting the Spinebuster on Miz then the People's Elbow for the win. 6/10, mainly for the crowd reactions as they were on fire in this match. Nice how Rock called Cena back to the ring, kept showing how the crowd loved him but hated Cena, then he hit a Rock Bottom on Cena and left the ring. One side note: I agree with the other review on here, that Cena needs to be turned heel, its a great time to do it.

Overall it wasn't a terrible Survivor Series, the 5 on 5 match was well done as was the WWE title match and the opening match was a good one as well. Its worth getting on DVD, but not a grand standout PPV.",1321833600,5,6742,4.304964539007092
4834326,4,B005M9VSJ6,"Survivor Series 2011 began with John Morrison VS Dolph Ziggler for the US Championship. The match between both men was pretty good, probably the best of the night. However, I felt the US Championship match should have been a Triple Threat with Zack Ryder involved. The fans were chanting ""We want Ryder"", which means they wanted their fellow New Yorker to wrestle for them but WWE dropped the ball. In my opinion, I felt John Morrison deserved the title shot more than Ryder ,since the man is more talented. Even if Ryder lost the match the fans would have still gotten some satisfaction. At least Ryder came out and beat up Ziggler and ran him off.

The Lumberjill match for the Diva's title was pretty decent Beth Phoenix picked up another victory against Eve Torres. I honestly believe Beth will keep the title until Kharma returns and maybe a match will be set up for them to wrestle at Wrestlemania 28.

The Five on Five match was pretty good with the Heel Group ""Team Barrett"" picking up the victory. It's good to see Wade Barrett and Cody Rhodes capture the victory, which is something different from the occasional Randy Orton victories. Randy Orton is a made man and doesn't need to continue winning to win over the fans they will love him regardless.

Mark Henry VS Big Show for the World Heavyweight Championship Match. Wow!! I'm shocked on the amount of fans that were behind Henry tonight. I believe Mark Henry came out with a bigger pop than the Big Show. The match was pretty decent but since both are huge you can't really expect a fast pace match. However, I'm mad the match ended in DQ, Why can't WWE turn Mark Henry into a SuperHeel and have him capture a clean victory over the big show? Anyways, Big Show got his revenge by putting the chair around Henry's ankle and breaking it. I'm pretty sure the World Heavyweight Title will be vacant now.

CM Punk VS Alberto Del Rio for WWE Championship. I'm disappointed that both these men didn't give it their all in this match. Both men are good wrestler that could pull off a 5 star match but they didn't. However, it was good to see CM Punk pick up his second WWE Title. The WWE are definitely behind CM Punk now by putting him as the top Babyface and not Cena.  Let's hope the WWE gives CM Punk a great run with the title.

The Main event The Rock & John Cena vs The Awesome Truth in a Tag Team match. If Vince doesn't turn Cena Heel now he's the dumbest guy  in WWE for not doing it. The Boos Cena received was Massive I mean fans didn't want him to step foot inside that ring. John Cena maybe loved by kids but the Adults hate him with a passion. The Rock received the biggest pop of the night and not a boo was heard, which is what a true Babyface should get. I felt the match should have been more of Rock inside the ring and less of Cena. Cena gets enough in ring action and The Rock is only wrestling part time so why not give him most of the match to Rock. The Rock showed no signs of Ring Rust in that match, which I'm hoping the WWE could squeeze more matches out of him. Watching the Rock wrestle made me fill like a kid again and watching a piece of the Attitude Era return. Anyways, I'm happy that Rock picked up the Victory and not Cena, which made my night. Overall, I gave the PPV 8/10, if Cena would have turned heel and betray Rock then I would've given the PPV a 10.",1321747200,3,3351,4.301109350237718
4834327,4,B005M9VSJ6,"The U.S. Title match between Doplh Ziggler & John Morrison was the showstealer but New York fans wanted to see Zack Ryder in that title match and the crowd shouted ""We Want Ryder"" to prove it. The Lumberjill match for the Divas title between Beth Phoenix & Eve was pretty good with Beth doing the Glam Slam on Eve off the top rope to boot. The 5-on-5 Elimination tag team match between Team Orton(Randy Orton,Sheamus,Mason Ryan,Kofi Kingston & Sin Cara) against Team Barrett(Wade Barrett,Cody Rhodes,Jack Swagger,Hunico & Doplh Ziggler) was not great but pretty good. The World's title match between Mark Henry & Big Show was slow & boring with only 2 highlights: Mark slamming Show into guard rail & Show's top rope elbow drop but ruined by a lousy DQ ending. The WWE title match between CM Punk & Alberto Del Rio was a solid,entertaining & back-and-forth bout with Punk winning the title making that much better. The tag team match between the team of John Cena & The Rock against the team of The Miz & R-Truth was also a solid,entertaining bout to say the least and the crowd really let their voices be heard when it came to John Cena & The Rock.

8479243,5,B005M9VSJ6,"This is probably one of the most exciting Survivor Series' in WWE History. On a side note, not only was this the 25th anniversary of Survivor Series, but also John Luranitas' 10th anniversary with WWE as Head of Town Relations and Iterim General Manager of Monday Night Raw. Now, onto the matches:

John Morrison vs Dolph Ziggler for the United States Championship

Throughout the fight, the audience was chanting ""We want Ryder"" in a response to Zack Ryder wanting an opprotunity. His petition on Twitter is currently the most signed petition in Twitter's history. At ringside for Dolph was Vickie Guerrero. She was banned after she tried to help Dolph out of a pinfall. The match ended with Dolph's victory. Vickie came back out and cried ""Excuse me"" because Dolph wanted to say he's not a showoff. As they leave, Zack Ryder enters and attacks Dolph Ziggler. He caused Dolph to run away, title in hand. As his theme plays, Zack plays with the audience, doing his famous ""Woo Woo Woo"".

Lumberjill Match: Eve Torres vs Beth Phenoix for the Divas Championship

The fight was a lumberjack match (lumberjill because it's girls). All the other Divas surround the ring. If one of the contenders exits the ring, the lumberjills throw them back in. The match ended in Beth's favor.

Before the next match, a backstage video was shown of David Otunga telling CM Punk he has to apologize before he fights, another showed the Rock talking about Maddison Square Garden, his history with the WWE, and his parter, John Cena. Using all his famous phrases, Boots to Asses, The Rock has come back to life, and IF YOU SMELL.....WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING!

Survivor Series 10 Man Tag-Team Match: Team Barrett (Wade Barrett, Hunico, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, and Cody Rhodes) vs Team Orton (Randy Orton, Sheamus, Sin Cara, Kofi Kingston, and Mason Ryan)

The match was quite intense, two contestants were out not by elimination. Sheamus got disqualified due to overattacking Jack Swagger, and Sin Cara was eliminated when he jumped out of the ring and tore a tendon. Team Barrett won with Cody Rhodes and Wade Barrett being the two sole survivors.

Mark Henry vs The Big Show for World Heavyweight Championship

Prior to the match begining, WWE officals had to re-inforce the ring with steel support beams. If you watched or were at Vengeance, you will know that the ring imploded in their last match. Mark Henry won by disqualification, because the Big Show broke Mark Henry's leg with a chair.

Alberto Del Rio vs CM Punk for the WWE Championship

CM Punk wanted this rematch after Alberto Del Rio cashed in his Money in The Bank contract on him at SummerSlam in August. Punk had apologized, so he was cleared. The match ended in CM Punk's victory. I personally believe Alberto Del Rio did not deserve the WWE Championship.

John Cena and The Rock vs The Miz and R-Truth (main event)

In this match, The Rock didn't even want to help John Cena, but did anyway. Miz and R-Truth were perfectly in sync, singing their new theme, U Suck, before the fight. The match ended in John and The Rock's victory. With both knowning only one of them will be the winner at WrestleMania XXVIII.

I personally loved this DVD. I loved all the matches, it's perfect for me. It makes me even more excited for WrestleMania because I will be in attendance. This DVD is still available for purchase and I recomend it if you're gonna watch WrestleMania.",1329696000,,3415,4.736930860033727
