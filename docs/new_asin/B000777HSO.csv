8045285,5,B000777HSO,"If you ever saw this on TV years ago, you probably laughed a LOT, especially at Kathy Najimy's barstool drunk, noticing the pretty woman next to him (Mo). ""You look very, very pretty t'naht,"" he'd slur every few mins. I have NO idea how she kept that cigarette in her mouth, wagging the whole time.

These 2 comedy performers were far better, far more than ever given credit for. And Kathy N, can play a nun, or any role with believeability and fun. I wish I'd seen more of them. This production is worth seeing after a long day, or when you just want to be entertained with some magic, as they transform themselves like caterpillars to butterflies.",1363392000,,649,4.5
8045286,5,B000777HSO,I have always watched both of these women perform together. They are still cutting edge after all this time. If we could just all sit back and remember how far we have come and how far we have to go.,1359936000,,199,4.0
8045287,5,B000777HSO,"Feminism at it's best. They have a brilliant point of view from all walks of life that you just love. Everyone knows at least one crazy aunt or silly girl friend or drunk in a bar that can you can relate to. Definitely one to watch with the girls (as my boyfriend ""didn't get it"").",1353715200,,281,4.127272727272727
8045288,5,B000777HSO,"I have enjoyed watching Parallel Lives many, many times in the past and it never gets old.  Kathy and Mo are of my generation and they are completely on point regarding the critical social issues they comment on in the historically best way possible:  comedy and satire.",1350000000,,270,4.723404255319149
8045289,5,B000777HSO,this was an excellent show.

8045291,5,B000777HSO,I saw this comedy years ago when it first came out and was shown on HBO.  It is just hysterically funny.  Their wit and humor is unchallenged.  A must see.,1125705600,3,155,4.1
