8608776,4,B00ERH14PC,"This film is about a young man named David Clyde, who leaves his hometown for London. He finds residence in a boarding house that's occupied by several women: Susanne, a cute teenager; Rachel, an upbeat secretary; Nancy, Rachel's shyer friend; Jane, a religious prude; Penny, a pornographic film actress; and Sally, a flight attendant. All of them end up hitting on David, seeing him naked, and/or having sex with him. After moving in, David has a short stint has a porn actor. He then starts working as a door-to-door vacuum salesman, a job he's not really cut out for. He makes seemingly every mistake possible, earns the ire of his boss, and finds that he has to fight off sexual advances from female customers.

""Secrets of a Door-to-Door Salesman"" was one of the many British sex comedies made during the 1970s, and it's good for what it is. I think the film is quite funny. Bernard Spear and Graham Stark are standouts in their supporting roles. And, as advertised, there are plenty of sex scenes. The best is the one with Penny, who was played by the beautiful Sue Longhurst. For lead actor Brendan Price, this was his first film role, and he went on to have a long career in television.",1487462400,,1194,4.632075471698113
