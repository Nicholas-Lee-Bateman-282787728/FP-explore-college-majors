8467615,5,B005DUNVE4,"Episodes 3 and 4 of Den som drber (Those Who Kill) feature on this discset. The drama and suspense is maintained from the first story. Again we see Laura Bach, Jakob Cedergren and Lars Mikkelsen playing convincing roles alongside guest actor Swede David Dencik&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brotherhood/dp/B0040Y5K8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brotherhood</a>.
The story starts with the discovery of a family murdered in their home. Curious Thomas Schaeffer (Cedergren) turns up and is promptly arrested!
Alongside other Scandinavian crime series, Den som drber certainly gives The Killing and Wallander a run for their money.
The series is available as five separate DVDs/BluRay sets. Alternatively the full set of DVDs can be purchased form any online Swedish website (Swedish title Den som drper) for less than $50 with English subtitles.
Enjoy the mystery.
Looking forward to more!",1319673600,,930,6.106870229007634
