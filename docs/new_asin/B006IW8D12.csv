8498984,4,B006IW8D12,"Q: What is the difference between a surgeon and God?
A: God doesn't think he's a surgeon.

A little medical humor courtesy of this year's Oscar entry for Best Foreign Film from France (English captions). It won Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Film at the 2011 Gijon Film Festival in Spain. This oddly intimate but affecting little piece is directed by Valerie Donzelli, who co-wrote the script with Jeremie Elkaim, the father of her two children and it's based on their own experience. They play a couple who meet, fall in love, and have a baby boy. Before he's a year old he is found to have a malignant brain tumor.

The Declaration of War in the title is the determination with which they confront the challenges of having a critically sick child: they keep themselves in good physical shape; they develop a plan to cope with friends and relatives; they present a united front to the medical world; they maintain a wry sense of humor; and they love their little boy without fail. As their world shrinks to the size of a children's hospital, we watch as they become familiar with the staff, the routine, the environment and the treatments. Occasionally they blow off steam by going dancing or riding on a motor scooter, but their everyday life is determined by their son's treatment schedule.

The sound track consists of some instrumentals, some songs sung by people on the screen, some rhythmic sounds that are the same beat as guys painting a wall with roller brushes, and others are just peculiar. Engaging but peculiar.... There are bits of humor scattered throughout, and given the topic matter, we clutch at them like straws for a drowning man.

The hospital staff is mostly sympathetic, but this personal crisis is just part of the job to them. Clearly based on personal experience, little touches feel authentic: the child is completely oblivious to his prognosis, he's more interested in Nintendo. By the way, the boy who plays their son at age eight is actually their own child.

For anyone who has been through this personal hell, it's satisfying to see that many of their thoughts and concerns are universal to the human condition. Amazon.com will notify me of the DVD release date.",1333843200,,2199,4.776315789473684
8498985,4,B006IW8D12,"Declaration of War is a love story, following two people named Romeo(Jrmie Elkam) and Juliette(Valerie Donzelli). Yet, this French film that was their entry in the Best Foreign Language award category, isn't the story of star crossed lovers fighting against a world hoping to keep them apart. It is a love story, but it's the love between two parents and their child, and their determination to form a united front against the terrible disease that threatens his life.

Don't walk in thinking this is some weeper you'll need a healthy dose of Kleenex to get through. Humor, a touch of whimsy, and a whole lot of imagination are the weapons in this fight, making for one of the best and unique movie experiences of the year. After a brief and fateful courtship that the two assume will lead to disaster based on their names, a whirlwind romance follows captured in joyous moments at the amusement park, chasing one another through city streets, sucking in life at its fullest. Their relationship is taken to the next level with the birth of their son, Adam. This beautiful boy becomes the center of their world, the reason for their existence, yet unlike other films the love between the two parents never falters. It merely changes and grows into something more.

Their world is flipped upside down as the ever watchful and worrisome Romeo begins to suspect something is wrong with their 18-month old boy, and soon their storybook romance becomes one of long hospital stays, grim faced doctors, and an uncertain future. To overcome it, and to keep their doting families from falling into disarray, Romeo and Juliette decide to form a united front against self pity and the destructiveness of doubt.

Similar to the cancer comedy, 50/50, Declaration of War uses humor and a light-hearted touch to tackle what is usually depressing subject matter. Even as Romeo and Juliette go through some of their toughest, saddest moments, we see them make time to have fun, not just for themselves but with their son. They dance through the hospital hallways, sneak off to the beach, and share the occasional flirty wink. What brings the film together is the very personal nature of the story. Donzelli, who not only directed but co-wrote the script with Elkam, also shares a son with him who survived a bout with cancer. They bring something real to the story that most films of this nature simply can't match.

In one of the film's most crucial and uplifting moments, at a time of despair Romeo asks ""Why did this happen to us?"" Juliette bolsters his spirits and ours with a knowing smile and simply says ""Because we can overcome it"".",1332374400,,2622,4.807095343680709
8498986,3,B006IW8D12,"""Declaration of War"" conveys both the joy of living and the long slog of serious illness. That the movie conveys both so well is a wonder. Especially in earlier parts of the film, the music and movement edge up to the joy of musical dance numbers without ever quite breaking into song and dance. It's quite effect shorthand for communicating life and happiness. The extra potency of near-musical vibrancy helps balance the equally well expressed strain of entering and enduring a prolonged medical battle. That the movie isn't 100% satisfying doesn't diminish it's many brave successes.",1328832000,,586,5.114583333333333
