8272950,3,B00199FWGS,"This is one of the weaker entries in the sword and sandal genre, although I'm not 100% sure it fits in with the same type of films like Hercules and Machiste. It's set in the Middle East during the Medieval era (as opposed to Classical Greece, Rome, etc.). Plus, none of the main characters are incredibly built like those other films. The women are sufficiently gorgeous, especially Bella Cortez who is the love interest of Ali Baba (the main hero). The film is in unfortunately extremely bad condition, particularly the opening, but also at other certain points in the film. Lots of pops in the audio and defects in the film. Fortunately the resolution is high enough to at least make out features of the characters except at extremely long shots. The main plot of the film is that an evil Lord (Emir?) is attempting to take over the entire region as King, but in order to do, he is informed that on the day the moon obscures the Sun, he has to defeat the Seven Saracens (which I assume are other Emirs) in deadly combat. One of those Saracens ends up being Ali Baba who I assume (it's difficult to tell precisely) is part of a rebel faction within the kingdom. Bella Cortez' character Fatima, aids Ali Baba at the beginning of the film for unknown reasons and quickly becomes the love interest. Many other things occur, some for various unknown reasons, but to sum up there are lots of fight scenes (the last 1/3 of the movie is mostly the various combat between the Saracens for ultimate leadership) and a dwarf (little person) for comedic relief. It's an okay film but one that I probably wouldn't watch again. I'm not 100% sure what the cover art for the film is supposed to represent, it has nothing to do with this film and it's not an animated feature.",1479686400,,1761,4.523510971786834

Peplum films are often characterized as Italian action movies that take place in ancient times and star Hercules, a Son of Hercules or one of many Hercu-surrogates. Feisty midgets sidekicks are not uncommon and there is usually at least one veil dance. The leading man in this film, while definitely a hero, is of non-Herculean stature. The movie also seems to take place in Medieval Middle East. However the movie does bear many similarities to the classic peplum including: 1. Gorgeous heaving Mediterranean women who majored in Veil Dancing in B-Movie finishing school, 2. The hero is a man of the people who delivers the masses from the rule of an oppressive tyrant, 3. If you try to follow the plot literally you'll end up in a straightjacket or with your head in a gas oven. Better to just flow along like a twig on the shoulders of a mighty river and enjoy the ride. For these reasons I am awarding this movie Honorary Peplum Status.

Piecing together the plot from scraps of intelligible dialogue was like deciphering the Rosetta stone, only much, much more difficult. I think it shakes out like this: An evil dude named Omar wants to win the Golden Throne of the Maji, which would give him total power over whatever country this thing takes place in. You can tell he's evil because he is always whipping someone, slapping someone or laughing maniacally and because he walks around shirtless and aggressively flashing his beefy nipples at everyone. ""Cower before Omar's mighty nipples!!!"" is a line often heard through this film. In order to win the Throne he has to fight the kingdoms greatest warriors, the Seven Saracens, plus another warrior who has been chosen by the gods (Ali Baba). Since he is evil he imprisons Ali Baba and a smoking hot princess with the hope that somehow this will help him defeat the other Saracens during the Big Tournament and Harvest Ball.

Ali isn't imprisoned long thanks to the intervention of Jookie the cunning dwarf (is there any other kind?). The most moving part of the film is when Jookie bids farewell to Ali, the only person to treat him like a friend, and the dwarf breaks down and cries. There's also a scene where a chubby guy in a turban dances on a tabletop for the rest of the prisoners who are clapping and laughing. I'm not sure what that scene was supposed to bring to the narrative, but it was disturbing enough to take your mind off the lonely, sobbing midget.

Well no sooner is Ali Baba away from the influence of a more competent person, which could have been anyone really, then he winds up captured and right back in Omar's torture garden.

Does he escape, win the throne, defeat Omar O'the Nipples and get the fabulous babe? Are you new? Of course he does, but I'll let this little flower of a film unveil its final petals for you all by itself.

The mass fight scenes are laughably terrible. The fencers seem more interested in not getting hit and then also in not hitting their opponent so you have a mob of burly guys in armor dancing gingerly around each other. In a few scenes I saw some of the extras appear to stop fighting and lean on their swords in order to catch their breath. But they were husky lads wearing heavy armor under a hot sun, so maybe they needed the break.

Believe it or not, it's the acting that makes this movie.

Not the acting of Bruno Piergentili who plays Ali Baba. He seems about as wooden and vaguely constipated as many peplum heroes, but who says the male lead in these movies has to be interesting? In this movie that's left to the supporting cast.

Gordon Mitchell as Omar makes an excellent over the top villain. Seriously he was more than a match for most peplum heroes. He menacingly glowers like nobodies business and tears up every scene he's in. Gordon Mitchell is just a whole lot of fun to watch.

Bella Cortez as Fatima, the bodacious babe, is the reason the word voluptuous was invented. She's why cavemen painted pouty lips on cave walls. Acting.....um.....yeah I think she does some acting.

Franco Doria played Sharif, Omar's aide de camp. He's evil, manipulative, cool headed, aloof and intellectual. He what would happen if Dick Cheney and Mr. Spock had a baby and Franco plays him perfectly.

Tony Di Mitri played Jookie the dwarf, who is the smartest and noblest character in the story. He's a likable guy.

The best fight scene is when the Harem girls take on Omar's personal bodyguards. Those girls had ALOT of repressed anger.

Ali Baba is as cheesy as it gets, but it's earnest in a Lil' Rascals/Andy Hardy ""Let's put on a show"" kind of way. It's ill scripted, improbable and illogical, but it still wants you to have a good time. So I say, if you're in the mood for some dopey fun and a ridiculously hot Cuban actress, give this movie a shot.",1286409600,4,4845,4.580831408775982
