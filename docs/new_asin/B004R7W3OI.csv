8630279,5,B004R7W3OI,"I enjoyed this ride because of the beauty of the surroundings, the instruction, casual but interesting conversation about biking, and the fact that it makes for a very solid, sweaty workout. I was dripping with sweat at the end, and I don't sweat easily.

The area we travel is gorgeous! I've driven through much of it by car, but not the rugged areas we go through in these two videos.

We choose if we want silence, music only, or music and instruction. The instruction was helpful and natural, after the initial, `clinical' instructions before the ride started.  Only rarely do we catch a glimpse of the handle bars. The ride gives us a view of the road ahead of us, with just a little bit of a look around from time to time.

There is excellent help with heart rate goals, gear ratio, and cadence. There's a GPS map view which shows where we've been and where we're going. There are ""hill and effort"" profiles along with speed and elevation information on the screen. I found them to be interesting without being in the way.

DAY 1
On Day 1, I completed Part 1, the 1 hour, 45-minute, which left me covered with sweat, knowing that I had done a good job. That was enough for me for 1 day, although that other video, Part 2, was tempting me to keep going.

Disk 1 goes through the Santa Ynez mountains, starting along the coastal trail into the downtown Santa Barbara area, quaint and beautiful, but that's just the warm-up. Next we hit Mission Ridge Road and ascend Rattlesnake Canyon, a steep, twisting road with an average grade of 8%, along Gibraltar Road. This is no smooth road!

We reach the summit and catch a quick glimpse of the ocean, hidden in the clouds, and the spectacular valleys below. At 1:45 minutes we end at what they call the ""false summit"" (Camino Cielo Road, where we leave the rest of the ride for another day.

DAY 2 - The Fog Rolls In And Stays!
On Day 2, I completed Part 2, the finish of the ride. It's cold and foggy. In fact, some of the equipment freezes.  That fog makes for a beautiful ride though, almost like riding through the clouds of Heaven. We start where we left off, and it's no picnic the rest of the way to the Summit of La Cumbre Peak, elevation of 3800 feet. The scary part for me was the descent, with lots of twists, made even scarier because it's windy and foggy. We finally end up at CA 154 in the Los Padres National Forest, one of my favorite places in the world!

I only allow myself to do indoor cycling because I'm otherwise dangerous. No way in the world would I ever survive an experience like  this in person. I can get the exercise benefit and appreciate the beauty of it at the same time, on any one of my pieces of exercise equipment.

Sometimes I use my spinning bike, but more often I start out on my `fancy' version elliptical for half an hour, move to my `traditional' elliptical (both Precor), then to my Ski-Skate machine for a minute or two, then finish off on my treadmill, all while watching my heart rate and cadence.

No matter how you choose to complete this ride, cycling expert or novice, you will be able to get an effective workout.",1328572800,,3113,4.39304347826087
