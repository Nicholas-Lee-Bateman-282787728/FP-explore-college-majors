8535721,4,B0094AH33E,"Again a most enjoyable production from Parma with an appealing stage direction, and nice sets and costumes. Francesco Meli is a convincing Riccardo with a with a light enjoyable voice. Kristin Lewis sings Amelia. Often I find myself disturbed by her heavy vibrato, but otherwise she has a powerful voice well suited to the role. Vladimir Stoyanov delivers a somewhat uninspired Renato, although his ""Eri tu"" seemed to please the audience. Both Serena Gamberoni (Oscar) and Elisabetta Fiorillo (Ulrica) are fine singers, although I think that the latter sometimes has an indistinct lower register. Crystal clear picture, fullbodied sound. The sound much better than in previous instalments of this series.

8535723,3,B0094AH33E,"Parma sure has a gorgeous house - the gift of Maria Louisa, I believe, to her adopted duchy.  It's a small provincial company, about equivalent to the Teatro Donizetti in Bergamo, and it's silly to expect more than you get here.  Except the hype is absurd, and consequently I spent nearly 40 bucks for a distinctly sub-par performance of one of my favorite Verdi operas.
The singers are ....OK (except the Ulrica, often a problematic role as who is going to engage/pay a major talent for one scene?).  Acting is nothing much one way or the other. Some pretty sets, but the transition to the ball scene at the end is depressingly anti-climatic.
If you can find it, there is a performance from LaScala in the late 70s floating around with a glorious pair of doomed lovers in Pavarotti and Mara Zampieri.  The cast is first rate throughout and puts this Parma thing entirely to shame.  Decors are magnificent and I've never seen a more spectacular coup de theatre than in the transition from Riccardo's electrifying (as sung but this young and un-fat Pavarotti) double aria to the ball.  The singing and stage craft rightly bring the house down.
I'm writing about something other than what I bought, because there isn't anything much to say about it.",1390521600,,1247,4.723502304147465
8535724,3,B0094AH33E,"Two reasons for a three star. One, the ""Ulrica""of Elisabetta Fiorillo and the conducting of G. Gelmetti.
In Act One Gelmetti speeds up on ""Volta la terra fronte"" and ""Ogni cura si doni al diletto"" and in Act Two he ruins ""O figlio d'Inghilterra"" using the same speed as in Act One.
Fiorillo does not have the low notes for the role of Ulrica, something that Simionato and Barbieri had plenty of.
In order of vocal quality Vladimir Stoyanov, ""Renato"" is the best of the bunch, followed by Francesco Meli, ""Riccardo"", Serena Gamberoni, ""Oscar"" and Kristin Lewis ""Amelia"".
Act after act the production is beautifully convincing.",1383696000,,625,4.90566037735849

Looks like I am here first and I am happy not to be influenced by other belly-aching, jaundiced 'reviewers'.
This a wonderful performance, even better than Boccanegra. Conductor Gianluigi Gelmetti, an unlikely looking gentleman at first glance but at his first wave of the baton I felt he was a master. His upbeat tempi has a big sweep throughout that gives the opera the brilliance Verdi intended. Every bar has deep significance because he knows this opera and its complexities to a Tee. Karajan had it too in Vienna, in fact the Ballo was one of his favorite and a big challenge.
Stupendous singers. Francesco Meli as Riccardo is a young fresh voice, powerful and sensitive, thoroughly in empathy with the character. Vladimir Stoyanov is beginning to take over from Nucci. Again he is young and the voice is powerful, well shaded and his acting puts a menace into his Renato and at the same time we really feel his agony of being betrayed. Serena Gamberoni (Oscar) is a delight to behold. Far from the usual petite, cutesy soubrette coloratura: she is a stunning beauty, her voice brilliant and light as a feather, moves like a real opera star! Ms. Kirstin Lewis (Amelia)is a radiant soprano with power and secure in her top notes acting with passion. Elisabetta Fiorillo (Ulrica)
is an old timer who perhaps have seen her glory days, but here as an alto she makes a truly three dimensional portrayal
of the wise and not at all wicked soothsayer.
About the scenery: it's simply eye-popping and stunning, grandiose highly artistic architectural and even monumental creations, gorgeous coloring. Unsurpassed. Highly recommended. You won't be sorry.",1376179200,4,1843,5.003257328990228
8535727,4,B0094AH33E,"This production was a big success in Parma in 2010. The video and sound engineers needed all 6 performances of the run to piece together a perfect Ballo (they usually require 2-3 performances). Once the video and sound engineers were done they produced a Ballo too good to be true. I am ashamed to admit that I enjoyed it more than any Ballo I ever experienced in any form - it's simply addicting.

This was Meli's debut as Riccardo (the Boston version was used). He has a golden tone, elegant phrasing, passions well projected, style, acuti - you also get a rock solid ""di' tu se fedele"" barcarolle with its low tessitura and the most perfect 12 note leap from high Ab to middle C.

The young soprano Kristin Lewis was making her debut as Amelia (as well as her house debut). Her articulation of Italian words and musical phrasing deteriorated in her more difficult parts (the latter acts) and she has almost no dramatic persona (she received some boos on opening night).

Elisabetta Fiorillo as Ulrica has a very impressive, booming low register - the rest of her voice is completely in tatters. Serena Gamberoni (Meli's wife in real life) as Oscar is almost perfect (no trills, though). She is no feather-light-voiced Oscar - her tone is full and impressive. She executes neatly the intricate acciacature, turns and staccatos in ""Volta la terrea"" and her ""Saper vorreste"" is incisive.

I was very impressed with Gianluigi Gelmetti's conducting. The opening immediately shows how he can make the rhythm dance. His rubati have an energy that comes not simply from propulsive thrust like in early Verdi, but from alertness and attention to the context. For example, at the end of act I scene I he accelerates: this is after Riccardo decides they should all go to Ulrica's house, and that it would be lots of fun. In that context the accelerando makes them sound very eager to go. He gives excellent support to the singers, the instruments blend well with the voices and the exemplary miking of the orchestra reveals wonderful attention to balance and detail.

Tiziano Mancini's superlative video direction turns a traditional, not-very-original staging into magic. The camera work manages well the difficult to shoot, semi-dark scenes. It's dynamic and very grand in a romantic way, with the fog, capes blowing in the wind and the grand tableaux vivants, like the one on the cover.",1367107200,16,2381,4.854679802955665
