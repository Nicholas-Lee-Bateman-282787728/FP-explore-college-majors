8715555,5,B00X99CL5Q,"This is a reissue DVD of Kathy Smith's Rejuvenation series.  It's not a new release, but it's new to me!  It was originally sold as a set that included the equipment.  This is only the DVD, which works out great because I already have most of the four items:  a resistance tube, a stretch band, a figure 8 loop, and a mini ball which is like one of those giant stability balls but only as small as a basketball.

Truthfully, you could get away with either the resistance tube or the stretch band and use them for both of those workouts.  The resistance tube is for a 10 minute upper body workout and the stretch band is for a 10 minute full body combo workout.  If it's too easy, you need a tube or band with more resistance or grip closer to the center of your stretch equipment.  I was really feeling it by the end of both workouts.

I don't have a figure 8 band, but a resistance loop twisted in a figure 8 shape works just as well.  This is for the 10 minute lower body workout.  It may be more comfortable to have the band wrap around socks instead of your bare shins.

The mini-ball workout is for ab work.  If you have a volley ball, basketball or soccer ball, you could probably make that work too.  In a pinch, you could do the ab work with an imaginary ball and still be able to do virtually all of the workout with less intensity.  I only say this because I intend to use this DVD as a travel workout, and I have no intention of packing a ball.

I bought resistance tubing years ago, but never touched it until this year until I came across workout DVDs that used it.  I bought the stretch band and resistance loop because of Cathe Friedrich workouts that used them.

If you don't have any equipment, you might just want to buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Ms-tone-Trouble-Zones/dp/B005BX3LQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Ms:tone Trouble Zones</a>&nbsp;which includes a toning band.  I'm still a fan of this DVD though because the upper body toning with the resistance tube is the best that I've tried so far.  Kathy Smith never wastes my time with anything too easy or too difficult.",1466985600,7,2145,4.6094986807387865
8715556,2,B00X99CL5Q,"I really wanted to like this workout, but I think it is just to causal the way she goes through the exercises.  Kathy often didn't keep pace with the music and or counts - almost like she was making it up as she went along.  It's not a bad workout - just not something I will try more than once.",1440028800,6,295,3.9
