I was inspired by her amazing story - it's one of sheer determination and tenacity to overcome a tragic accident, and in the process, to rewrite the rest of the chapters in her life.  Her one woman show is ideal for anyone who is attempting to illustrate human resilience, a mother's love and dedication in progress vs. perfection, and overcoming the difference between something happening to us and what we choose to do about it moving forward.  I'd highly recommend this DVD - and this person.",1305590400,,580,4.611650485436893
8380051,5,B002TBTYE6,"I composed the music for this show, ""A Distant Memory"" by actress, speaker and artist, Jennifer Field. Seventeen years ago, Jennifer was in a horrific car accident that left her in a coma and unable to walk or talk. The doctors said she'd basically be a vegetable. Well, they were wrong. After fifteen years of traveling all over the world working with an amazing array of therapies, she's recovered and now touring with her one woman show, ""A Distant Memory"". The show chronicles her courageous, fifteen year quest to get her life back. Before the accident she had been a champion equestrian rider. She also has started a foundation to help inspire and inform victims of traumatic brain injuries and help those that can't afford the alternative therapies that helped her. This show is an major inspiration for anyone who has dealt with recovering from a serious injury, as well as the rest of us that deal with the challenges of everyday life. Check it out!",1259625600,4,958,4.77710843373494
