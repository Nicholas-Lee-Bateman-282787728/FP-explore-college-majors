500096,5,6302707757,"What could be funnier, or scarier, then an Irish dwarf on a deadly quest for his gold? Not very much, I tell you. This is the ""Fargo"" of killer Leprechaun films--well constructed, edgy with a bawdy sense of  humor, and plus that funny accent. Warwick Davis was robbed of his Oscar,  but here's hoping for ""Leprechaun 5,"" when this talented group of  filmmakers will finally get their recognition.",930700800,,396,4.794117647058823
500097,4,6302707757,"Leprechaun was a very funny movie. It didn't scare me at all. Plus, it introduced me to Jennifer Aniston. :) It mixed gore with giggles and I truly loved it. The best part is when the kid goes ""F*** you, Lucky  Charms!""",917049600,,219,4.214285714285714
500108,5,6302707757,"A small,ugly,and bloodthristy Leprechaun is on a murder rampage when he gets released from his earthly prison. He soon finds out that someone has his gold,all 100 coins. He finally gets it back but the Leprechaun(WarwickDavis)only has 99 coins. He then looks all over for it killing as he goes. With cool makeup and special effects this is a movie worth seeing. The Leprechaun is much better than Freddy Kruger(Nightmare on Elm. St.)and Jason(Friday the 13th)put together. Then for more horror fun see Leprechaun 2 and Leprechaun 3. KISS ME I'M IRISH!",989539200,,551,5.0
500109,5,6302707757,"A great movie, funny, moving, and, well not scarey, but even though it's not scarey, I still give this movie my ""simply irresistable"" rating.",984873600,,141,4.916666666666667
500110,5,6302707757,"Leprechaun is a great movie it does have a couple areas were you jump and is scary a little but I have to agree with other reviewers that while it does have a scary theme to it, it also has humor to it. but all in all it  is one of my favorite movies so I highly recommened this movie.",961113600,,285,3.75
500111,5,6302707757,"This was a great movie. It had a great story line and was also Jennifer Anistons first movie. Warwick Davis shined in the part of the Leprechaun. However don't expect a scary movie because if you do you will be extremely  dissapointed,this movie is more of a comedy than a horror movie in fact the  nly rerason why it would even be considered horror is because of the gore  and very cruel death scenes, I mean lets face it the pogo stick death was a  classic",955152000,,458,4.290697674418604
500112,5,6302707757,"This is another of my fav movies.  This first installment beats out the second and comes close to the third.
Warwick is hilariously funny as the Leprechaun, and its too bad that he's one of Hollywood's  underappriciated actors.
If you like cheesy, campy fun this movie is  definately for you!",953596800,,292,4.8
500113,5,6302707757,"Leprechaun, although classified as a horror movie, is hysterical! It's just so funny due to the fact that it takes itself way too seriously. It's next to impossible to make a little leprechaun scary. And it's also  impossible to not laugh at the clever one-liners and rhymes the little  green guy dishes out. Jennifer Aniston does a good job playing the heroine  too, although her best work to date is definitely Friends. Go buy  Leprechaun for good, gory fun!",953078400,6,460,4.784810126582278
500114,4,6302707757,"i don't know why this movie was in the horror section when i rented it.it should of been in comedy.this movie was just hilarious.the leprechaun's accent cracked me up.get this movie,and you'll wanna watch it a million  more times.great movie.",952214400,,242,5.05
500115,4,6302707757,"LEPRECHAUN is one of the masterworks of modern cinema. Stroke of genius: what's-her-name from FRIENDS actually seems more annoyed by little Warwick Davis than scared.
In short, a powerful, devastating, and brutally honest  depiction of what happens when you get between a leprechaun and his gold.  Plus, that little green guy's kinda sexy.",949536000,,339,5.377358490566038
500116,2,6302707757,Valley girl and her father move out to a country setting unaware that in their basement is a killer leprechaun looking for his pot of gold. Does that sound right? Entertaining and fun little horror film is spoiled by  sloppy gore and nastiness. Funny how almost the entire cast are comedians.,944784000,3,292,4.7254901960784315

7829949,5,6302707757,this is a awesome movie. the luck of the irish has ran out for tori when a deranged leprechaun goes on a killing spree to find his pot of gold. can she escape this irish monster or has her luck really ran out. warwick davis is excellent as the leprechaun in these series. the make-up effects are amazing and the acting is good and the story is good. there are not too many movies for st. patrick's day and this is one you need to watch. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1425686400,,492,4.030612244897959

7829951,3,6302707757,"In Leprechuan Irish men catches a leprechaun makes him  get his gold.  The Leprachun is partically imposible to kill.  He can only be killed if a frehs pluck four leefed clover is placed on his body.
The Leprechaun tracks the man to his house where he kills his white.  The Leprechaun is locked in a crate where he remainds traped for ten years.  Later ozz  fat dork  guy is tricked into releasing the creature.
He leaves a trail of death and destructions. Like childplay has somecheesy death scenes. Like when the Leprechaun kills this guy with a Pog Stick by jump un and down on top of his lung. Than he takes the coin and steals a tinny toy car.
In the end the Leprechaun is killed she the movie and watch its explosive conclusion.  If  you like this see  the five sequels to it.",1083801600,,782,4.3310344827586205
7829952,1,6302707757,"blehhhh, horrible beginning to a horrible series. this is either scary nor funny, though its fun in some parts if I may correct myself. but no logic and a stupid premise involving shillings(what aren't shillings like a penny a piece, so if the leprechaun has 100 shillings, then he has a dollar, cool plot to kill off people, he must of been in poverty at the time). and Jennifer Aniston is wasted too. ugghhhh",1066694400,2,410,4.554054054054054
7829953,2,6302707757,"Who doesn't love a killer leprechaun looking for his pot of gold? Well, besides perhaps any self-respecting movie critic. Well, he's small, green, and he's looking for his pot of gold (seriously) and a poor group of kids is in his way including a pre-Friends Jennifer Aniston who I'm sure wishes this movie would dissapear forever.
While this could be one of the dumbest movie ideas ever conceived (aside from any of its four sequels), it still makes for some stupid laughs.",1060128000,,474,4.7926829268292686
7829954,5,6302707757,"I thout this was an awesome show. I wish I could have it. I like the Leprechaun. He is scary, but that's ok I like scary movies. Leprechaun is the best show on the whole planet.",1015286400,,177,3.9444444444444446
7829955,3,6302707757,"Yep, I just rented this movie for just 99 cents at my local video store, so I figured that I'd add my own 2 cents here.  This is a barely-competent ""B"" horror/comedy which does have a few cool scenes and a few good laughs.  Basically, it is a showcase for 3 things: 1) It gives us Warwick Davis--formerly so cute, genteel, and heroic as the titular WILLOW--as the horrific and murderous titular LEPRECHAUN. The point of this movie is to see how many big people that the diminutive Davis can kill, and in what gory ways possible. 2) The great makeup job on Davis, which in of itself is a character: it makes him look effectively comical, and very creepy. 3) Jennifer Aniston in an early pre-""Friends"" role.
Bottom line: this is an effective low-budget horror flick, but make sure that you don't spend too much on the video.  Also, make sure to keep your pre-teen kids away from it, as this is a fairly gory movie that is likely to give them nightmares. For kids in the 10-to-12-year-old range that like a good scare, I'd recommend POLTERGEIST, or the 1978 remake of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS instead.",1006819200,,1104,4.5376884422110555
7829956,3,6302707757,"After capturing a true leprechaun and stealing his pot of gold, Dan O'Grady thinks life is just great. Until the leprechaun wants his pot of gold back and becomes an Irishman's nightmare.
I found this movie to be just great. It had originality, suspense, but not a whole lot of scares. Some scenes also stole from Wes Craven's A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and The Leprechaun was also funny like Freddy Krueger. But he ain't the only funny guy in the film. Don't forget Ozzie - the fat (...) guy. He's one of the reasons why LEPRECHAUN is an awesome horror flick. He ended up being one of those useless guys who do everyone a favor by risking his life and creating a diversion.
I've only seen the first two LEPRECHAUN films so far, and the first one is the best. The sequel ain't that bad, but it doesn't really compare to the first. In fact, it doesn't even take off from the original film.
LEPRECHAUN is fun to watch.
I hope my review was helpful to you!",1006041600,,952,4.353932584269663
