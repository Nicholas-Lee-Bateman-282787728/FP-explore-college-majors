8534340,2,B0091LYE5Q,"This is a 3D only blu-ray so you will need a 3D blu-ray player, 3D TV, and 3D glasses to view it.  The description of the run time is not accurate.  Each of the three aquariums plays for only twenty five minutes.  Not the forty five minutes each stated on the package.  So it delivers an hour less than promised.  I could not even sit through the whole 25 minutes without skipping ahead.  The view point is fixed and there are very few fish in the salt water tanks.  I personally was not mesmerized but you may have a different experience.",1437696000,,539,4.2772277227722775
