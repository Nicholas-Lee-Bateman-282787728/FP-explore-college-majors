221922,4,6300185974,"This little thriller from 1960 echoes the tasteful talents of Sir Alfred  Hitchcock and his 1954 production of the Frederick Knott stage hit  ""Dial M for Murder."" Doris Day and Rex Harrison star as a wealthy  upper-class newlywed couple living in modern-day London. He is the boss of  a prestigious company and she lives at home, enjoying married life and all  it has to offer. The joy comes to an abrupt end when she starts getting  menacing phone calls and hears high-pitched voices calling at her from the  fog of London. Her husband will not believe her claims and her best friend  feels helpless in what appears to be a simple case of a neglectful husband.  But who can't be suspicious when Day is nearly hit by a bus, breaks down in  a stopped elevator, sees a man's shadow in her bedroom window at night,  gets phone calls over and over, and is almost labeled as insane by those  who know her best. The tension and suspense gets to be too much to stand  for first time viewers, who cannot leave their seat once the film reaches  its final quarter. The photography by Russell Metty (who won an Oscar that  same year for his colorful photography of 'Spartacus') is at once appealing  and splashy then changes to dark and foreboding, that there is someone in  the shadows waiting and watching. One could suspect that Alfred Hitchcock  had a hand in this but notice the similarities between this and ""Dial  M for Murder""...both husbands are named Tony, both stories are set in  London, there's a phone involved, John Williams and Anthony Dawson both  starred in ""Dial M..."" with Williams playing the detective and  Dawson as the would-be killer. They each reprise such a character in  ""...Lace."" Each film is based on a play. Day, John Gavin,  Williams, and Dawson all worked with Hitchcock in different films. And each  one poses enough wonder and apprehension to keep you watching to see how it  will all turn out. Day played a similar role in the 1956 film  ""Julie"". In any case, this mystery thriller belongs on the shelf  of any film buff who loves mystery films and who adores Hitchcock. That  twist ending will leave you gasping and wondering, ""Why didn't I think  of that?""",968371200,14,2184,4.641361256544503
221923,3,6300185974,"The plot of this movie is certainly interesting enough and has enough suspense and action to keep the viewer interested, however I was disappointed by the bad acting, especially from Doris Day. She is an  excellent actress and has previously been extremely entertaining in other  suspense trillers. But the character of Kit is clearly amateurish and  melodramatic. I found the almost constant sobbing and wailing to be  overdone and would have preferred Kit to be a stronger person. Despite this  however, the movie is entertaining and has a surprise ending.",953856000,4,558,5.155555555555556
221924,5,6300185974,"Doris Day is one of the most underrated actresses in the business. Her performance in this exciting thriller is brilliant. The film is expertly directed by David Miller who keeps the pace edge of the seat speed. Doris'  scene trapped in an elevator is harrowing and her final breakdown is  brilliantly acted. She looks fabulous and her wardrobe is exquisite. No one  wear clothes better than Doris Day. For those of you who basically know  Doris Day as a singer and a commedienne,this movie will show you whata fine  actress Doris Day really was. She makes it alllook so easy. Midnight Lace  isa top rate thriller. A greatwhodunnit. A top notch DorisDay film.

221990,4,6300185974,Enjoyable mystery.  Rex Harrison is always good.  At times Doris Day is a bit over -the -top in her emotional melt-downs. (She supposedly called upon depths of emotion experienced from real-life spousal abuse while pregnant.  She subsequently said she would never do another mystery like this again).

221994,4,6300185974,"Review of Midnight Lace
Hot Toasty Rag, February 4, 2018

Despite the frilly-sounding title, Midnight Lace is not a girly chick flick. Its very scary, putting Alfred Hitchcocks films to shame. As it is, I liked it very much, but I would have loved it had I watched it in the afternoon instead of the evening. Some movies are just scary for me!

Doris Day is married to Rex HarrisonI know, suspension of disbeliefand is trying to adjust to her new married life in London. She hears a frightening voice while walking home alone one day, but thats just the beginning. . . Someone is following her and threatening her, but when she tells her husband and the police, no one believes her. Myrna Loy, her aunt, comes for a visit, but an added authoritative presence doesnt deter the stalker.

Ive said it before, but Midnight Lace is pretty scary. If you liked getting frightened by the phone calls in Scream, you might find it fun to watch Screams grandfather film. Doris is great, as she always is when given a chance to show her dramatic talents, and with John Gavin, Herbert Marshall, Roddy McDowall, and Hermione Baddeley to round out the supporting cast, shes got plenty to work with. Im not a Rex Harrison fan, but he didn't ruin the movie. Try it out on Halloween and see what you think!",1517702400,,1288,4.543103448275862

222018,5,6300185974,"Why has this movie been snubbed for so long? It's' everything you want in a classic mystery -- and it is the most terrifying of any of them! Used to think this was made by Alfred Hitchcock. (Actually, tops his in my opinion.) LOVE the credits when she runs into the gate! Spectacular opening. Gives you everything you want when you think of the quintessential mystery. It's glamourous and yet nail-biting 'til the very end. Doris Day also does a fantastic job. A LITTLE FILM TRIVIA: This role was nearly too much for her because she had to draw on memories from a bad former marriage to act the scenes where she was supposed to be having a nervous breakdown. My only critique is I wish the building contractor who pursues her was a little older.  Otherwise, perfection.",1512777600,,769,4.572463768115942

Finally, more than half way through I had an idea of the real stalker and was right, though not quite in the way I had imagined (I can't give details because that would ruin the movie for others).

If you haven't seen this one coming, you'll find out why. Midnight Lace has acquired a cult following and has enough tension to hold its own for a second glance. It utterly falls apart upon repeat viewing, however. The transfer is region free, meaning you can play it anywhere in the world. Overall, it won't set the world on fire but it is competently rendered without impressing. A shame more care wasn't taken somewhere along the way. But there it is. No extras either.

222377,4,6300185974,"I enjoyed watching MIDNIGHT LACE starring Doris Day and Rex Harrison.

The movie is a suspenseful thriller where Day plays this stereotypical ""damsel in distress"" -- I guess this was the accepted norm for female characters in 1960 who weren't the bad girl femme-fatales in Noir films -- named Kit Preston, a vanilla white newlywed trophy wife who has recently moved to London to be with her husband Anthony Preston (Harrison). Someone starts threatening to kill poor Kit, once in a fog-filled park and then endlessly on the telephone, with this high-pitched, sing-song voice and the poor woman is terrorized to the point of madness! But she looks great clutching her head with both hands with the look of absolute HORROR on her face, crying, as the phone rings incessantly, while things go bump in the dark, and poor Kit is frozen with fear.

In the storyline viewers only hear the threatening voice twice, in the beginning and the end, and the other characters never hear it until the end, so one is never quite sure if Mrs. Preston is actually receiving threatening calls from the same person, what the voice is actually saying, or if she's just becoming unhinged and imagining all of it or worse making it all up because she feels neglected. This plot device is what keep viewers interested in the movie until the end, and where Day really shines in this characterization as the hysterical wife, because one can see all of the above outcomes being possibilities. At times you want someone to kill her, at others you think she's making it all up, still others one thinks that she's losing her mind, and that keeps viewers watching until the truth is revealed.

Anyway, listening to the fabulous intro by TCM's host Robert Osborne and we learn that this movie was so emotionally taxing that Doris Day had a nervous break-down during the filming and vowed to never do another like it.

The picture quality is pretty good, but I do notice a haze around the shots with Day and Myrna Loy (who plays her Aunt Bea), which was probably in the actual source film (I heard that gauze and Vaseline was used as a camera filter on movies from this era as a way to make actresses more ethereal and dreamlike, not to mention ageless/no wrinkles, on the big screen) so that probably couldn't be helped.

I took off one-star because of the above and some viewers might actually have trouble with suspension of disbelief especially with certain scenes in the movie -- of course context is everything -- like when the caller calls, why doesn't Kit hangup immediately instead of listening, crying and shivering and asking ""why?"" as she continues to listen to him? Of course we wouldn't have a movie in that case, but some viewers will find it hard to believe and quite comical at times. Also, NO SPOILER, but at end, it seems very odd as though some scene was cut-out, but the very end is nonsensical.

Roddy Mcdowall, Hermione Baddeley, and handsome John Gavin co-star in the movie as well. I think Gavin's character is supposed to be British but his accent isn't really there especially when he's in scenes with Baddeley, but with a face like his who's listening?

There's some good extras on this DVD as well:

As long as you aren't expecting too much from this movie, I think most people will enjoy MIDNIGHT LACE in a cult-like way.

Other than all that this a nice suspense film with good performances by all, including Rex Harrison, Myrna Loy, and Roddy McDowall.  Only false note:  John Gavin, though he tries and gives an OK performance, cannot do an English accent.  The quality of the TCM DVD release is excellent with a lot of extras.

Rex Harrison is delicious as her husband and Myrna Loy gives a good performance as Day's aunt Bea.

She was also a wonderful dramatic actress, and her performance in this film is just as brilliant as was her work in the second Hitchcock version of The Man Who Knew Too Much.

222459,1,6300185974,"PLEASE NOTE: This Is A 4 1/2 STAR Movie On A Shameful 1 Star dvd!!!

UPDATE ON DVD MISSING BONUS FEATURES: TCM did replace my defective dvd that was missing the 3 best bonus features right away, after I spoke with them and returned the defective dvd (at their expense). The Bonus Features alone are worth the price of this dvd, but the film itself is still cut off at the bottom- missing people's feet and shoes- which makes the film still 1 Star. If TCM hadn't cut off the bottom of the film, the movie itself would have rated 4 1/2 Stars with 5 Stars for the GREAT Bonus features. When you receive your Midnight Lace TCM version dvd- check right away to make certain ALL 12 of the bonus features are on your dvd, so at least if you receive a defective one, you can return it immediately and get the correct copy.

Midnight Lace is one of Doris Day's finest acting performances in a psychological terror film. This 1960 film partnered Doris with Rex Harrison, just following her hugely successful 1959 hit film- Pillow Talk and her 1960 Please Don't Eat The Daisies. Doris plays Kit Preston, an elegant newlywed wife to British Financier Anthony Preston (Rex Harrison). Although the film was supposed to be shot in England, it ended up being shot on the Universal lot and sound stages, with some scenes being actually shot in England with stand-ins.

Doris Day's wardrobe is beyond elegant high fashion, being designed by Hollywood's famous fashion designer- Irene. Doris fell in love so much with a beautiful long 2 piece white gown she wore in this film- she asked and was allowed to wear it to the Oscars! The clothes were so gorgeous, the studio actually rented real Harry Winston jewelry, as costume jewelry looked like junk on Irene's beautiful designer clothing. To add to the film's gorgeous clothing, Harry Winston jewelry and beautiful stars, it was produced by Ross Hunter- whose films are simply lush with color on the sets, interiors and scenery.

The supporting cast features the handsome Rock Hudson look-alike John Gavin, the lovely Myrna Loy, Roddy McDowall and more. With such a great cast and lots of Ross Hunter's visual eye candy, seeing what TCM Vault Collection did to this movie is unforgivable! The dvd I received from TCM's web site is actually missing 3 of the Bonus Features- and not just any 3, but the best ones! My dvd (and my friend's) are both missing the Fashion Featurette- showcasing Irene's fashions being modeled by Miss Day, the Original Trailer and a Radio Interview Excerpt.

The other Bonus Features which are included are: Robert Osborne Intro, Scene Stills, Movie Posters, Color Scene Stills, British Front Of House Stills (we call them movie theatre stills), Publicity Stills, Fashion Stills, Costume Designs (Sketches by Irene) and the TCMDb article on the movie. All the bonus features are great, but I want the 3 missing ones on my dvd, so I have reported this mistake to the TCM website, and they told me they will look into this and replace mine if they can find a dvd that does actually have these 3 missing bonus features. I will add a new update, if TCM actually has the dvd with complete bonus features.

Now, for the worst part of this dvd. Someone at TCM Vault took it upon themselves to make this Midnight Lace a more widescreen film. So, they cut off the bottom of the film to make it wider! When they cut off the bottom, they also cut off things like people's feet!! I actually couldn't believe they did this to this visually lovely film. When Miss Day is running, you see her ankles with no feet at the bottom of the screen in some parts. I had to go and compare this TCM Midnight Lace dvd to my old television copy and my Universal copy from the U.K., which is a region 2 dvd. WOW, on my crummy television copy and my Region 2 dvd- Miss Day's feet and shoes are completely in the film and are actually seen in their entirety as she is running!

I actually watched both my Region 2 and TCM's dvd side by side- and you will not believe how much of the film is missing when you cut off the bottom of a film. No one could help me on the phone number I have, to the TCM website, when I asked who do I complain to about the bottom of this film being cut off! So, I'll find a higher up at TCM Vault and complain bitterly! TCM constantly tells the importance of letterbox films being kept in tact, so we see the whole film on their television channel, so seeing them butcher Midnight Lace is totally inexcusable!

Paying TCM $20.00 plus tax and shipping for a dvd missing the bottom of the film and missing the 3 best bonus features is unbelievable. I'm just happy I have an all region dvd player, so at least I can still enjoy my Region 2 Midnight Lace dvd until TCM gets it together. My advice is to WAIT until TCM has all 12 of the Bonus Features on this dvd AND the entire movie as it was filmed without missing Miss Day's and everyone else's feet and anything else that is on the bottom of the screen!",1397001600,17,4960,4.466887417218543
222460,5,6300185974,"I was thrilled to find MIDNIGHT LACE listed at Amazon on Blu-ray.  It's one of the very few films by Doris Day that I didn't own.  I received the disc today.  My initial feeling was one of concern, as the packaging indicates that the disc is coded only for Region B.  I needn't have worried, as it plays just fine on my Region A Blu-ray player.  Although a bit shrill at times, Doris turns in a very professional performance, a refreshing change from the light comedies she had been playing.  MIDNIGHT LACE is a tidy thriller - a bit predictable in the outcome, but still a very enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours.  Doris looks fantastic in the outfits by Irene.  Rex Harrison is his usual sophisticated self, and it's always a pleasure to see Myrna (not ""Myra"" as in the overview on the back cover) Loy in anything.  Add a depth of casting that includes Roddy McDowell, Herbert Marshall, and Hermione Baddeley, and you're in for a treat.

I was disappointed that it would only play on my computer, but was warned of that possibility from the start. I'm surprised this little gem from the early '60s has not found more widespread release on DVD: it's a chestnut, for sure. The cast alone is worth watching: Doris Day (at her dramatic best), Rex Harrison (earning his nickname), Myrna Loy, John Gavin, and even Roddy McDowell in his best unctuous cad mode. Also Herbert Marshall in one of his last screen roles, and Hermione Baddeley doing her best Hermione Baddeley. It's all great fun. If you've never seen (or heard of) it, you're in for a treat.

Starring a stellar cast of Doris Day, Rex Harrison, John Gavin, Myrna Loy and Roddy McDowall, the movie features Day as an heiress married to a London business tycoon. Wedded only three months and living in the unfamiliar London, Day becomes the target of a caller who says he is going to kill her before the month is out. Police say it is only a telephone talker who likes the ""intake of her breath,"" but the calls continue with increasing knowledge of personal information. She is surrounded by a barrage of possible suspects, including an admiring construction foreman, a gambling colleague of her husband's, the ne'er do well son of her maid and a mysterious figure shown following her about town. Suspense esclates as Day's nerves threaten her undoing, and an exciting climax brings Day face to face with her tormentor.

222519,5,6300185974,"Doris Day was probably one of the most underrated of actresses.  Because she was such a cheery, bubbly person, during the studio days they kept putting her into light frothy comedies---a rare exception being this film.  In this movie Doris Day plays Kit Preston and Rex Harrison her husband of three months, Tony.  These two have fabulous chemistry, the sets are gorgeous---I'd LOVE to have their London flat---they all wear astonishingly beautiful clothes...I could go on and on.  The script is intelligent and the co-stars fantastic.  Roddy McDowall, one of my favorite actors, plays a slimy son and does it to perfection.  John Gavin, one of the most beautiful males I ever saw in my life, plays the construction foreman who saves Kit twice, and his performance is both tender and protective.  Herbert Marshall, a really good character actor, is also in this film and he's excellent, as always.  And Myrna Loy is both stunning to look at and pitch perfect as Kit's Aunt Bea.  She can do more with her eyebrows and voice to get a subtle point across better than any other actress I've ever seen.  I honestly didn't see the twist ending coming at all, and I love movies like that, that set you in one direction to totally turn you around at the end.

For a long time I've owned the VHS version of this fabulous film and I've been hunting for the DVD version for years.  I almost didn't buy this because although it claimed to be for all regions I found that difficult to believe.  I was very pleasantly surprised to find that it worked fine in my DVD player (I'm an American).  The outside packaging is in Portuguese.

I don't remember ever seeing John Gavin in any other movie( 'tho I'm sure he was).Well written, performed and filmed. Truly the best film of 1960 in my opinion, & the best performance of her career.

222530,4,6300185974,"""Midnight Lace"" is the ultimate frothy Sunday movie. Suspenseful, lush, and a bit silly, it shows Doris Day at her fretting, weeping best. Anglophiles will find this particularly satisfying, with the wonderful London exteriors, the stereotypical cheerful Cockney barmaids and workmen, as well as the wonderful opening scene that finds Ms. Day wandering through the perfect London fog while a disembodied voice threatens to do her in. Myrna Loy was wonderful as the somewhat stereotypical wacky Aunt (think Auntie Mame) with her long cigarette holders and globetrotting habits, and Rex Harrison (is it just me or can I not see any of his films without thinking of the scene in ""Weird Science"" where Kelly LeBrock says to one of the grandparents, ""You just can't walk in and start beating people with your Rex Harrison hat!""?) is wonderful with his pomaded, suave English husband mannerisms.
It is a bit silly, and it is a little trite to see Doris Day just fall right apart and sabotage her own believability with the occasional silly lie; certainly female protagonists have came much farther in our present day. But this isn't brain surgery; and its great fun. I just love these old technicolor films with hues that you just don't see anymore and probably didn't even exist without excellent lighting and saturation. A good one to pair with a Hitchcock film, though of course, he was the Master, and this aspires to be in the vein without quite being a contender.

She will convince you she believes she is losing her mind. Usually happy and cheerful, which I really appreciate at midlife and in this less than happy modern world, this twist in her charactype is a real head turner.  She is as impossible to ignore here as she was in her role in Love Me or Leave Me.  I think Rex is just as odd in his role as she is in hers.  No Dr. Doolittle here, I assure you.  I think Hitchcock picked them because they were so impossible for the roles yet so versatile as actors that you wouldn't believe it was THEM unless you saw it with your own eyes.  It's just an acting marvel that will keep your pulse racing until the last minute.  Pick any other two more suitable actors for these roles and this film would be far less memorable. Elegant yet playful Myrna Loy adds that essential realism that is the glue which holds this movie together.",1279152000,,1180,4.260089686098655

222551,4,6300185974,"Fog-shrouded London is the setting for MIDNIGHT LACE, a glossy thriller starring Doris Day as a terrorised heiress.

Doris Day plays Kit, an American heiress, newly-married to suave English businessman Tony Preston (Rex Harrison). Kit's life couldn't be happier, until she becomes the target of obscene phonecalls and begins to have 'accidents'. The detectives at Scotland Yard begin to feel that perhaps Kit is seeking attention, and even Kit's loving Aunt Bea (Myrna Loy) has her doubts. Is Kit going mad? Or is a killer really out to get her?

Doris Day delivers a finely-pitched performance in this frothy thriller. In order to convey the reality of her character's situation, Ms Day drew from her abusive first marriage to musician Al Jordan. The painful memories that Day re-lived for her scenes resulted in the production having to temporarily halt after Day collapsed in hysterics on-set. In the final scene of the film you can tell that Day was completely drained; with her face puffy, lined and streaked with tears.

The rest of the cast is equally fine: Rex Harrison as Kit's romantic husband Tony, the legendary Myrna Loy adds some much-needed comedy as Kit's beloved Aunt Bea; and John Gavin as helpful construction foreman Brian Younger.  The gallery of supporting players includes Roddy McDowall, Natasha Parry, Herbert Marshall, Richard Ney, John Williams and Hermione Baddeley. John Williams' role as a Scotland Yard inspector harks back to his character in the similarly-themed ""Dial M for Murder"".

MIDNIGHT LACE was filmed on location in London, with Doris Day's wardrobe exclusively-designed by Irene. The story was lifted from a little-known play by Janet Green called ""Matilda Shouted Fire""; the screenplay by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts adds some obvious Hitchcockian touches.

222572,5,6300185974,"Whatever you do, Doris -- don't answer that phone!

36-year-old Doris Day gives a winning and realistic performance in the 1960 suspense-filled thriller ""Midnight Lace"", with Doris portraying an American woman living in London who is being incessantly stalked and threatened by a mysterious voice over the telephone.

There's a nice London ""feel"" to this movie. Lots of misty and foggy atmosphere. Plus a look at a few famous London landmarks as well. The opening scene in the dense fog, when Doris first hears the voice of her menacing stalker, sets the chilling tone of the film very nicely.

Co-starring alongside Miss Day in ""Midnight Lace"" are -- Rex Harrison, John Gavin, Myrna Loy, John Williams, Roddy McDowall, Herbert Marshall, Hermione Baddeley, and Natasha Parry. And there's Anthony Dawson as well, who turns up here in a very creepy role. The scenes with Anthony on screen are likely to induce a few chills up the ol' spine.

One of Doris' co-stars in ""Lace"", John Gavin, had a very productive year in 1960, appearing in a hefty total of four major motion pictures during that calendar year. His other 1960 projects included two massively-popular films: the epic ""Spartacus"" and Alfred Hitchcock's immortal ""Psycho"", in which he played Janet Leigh's love interest, ""Sam Loomis"". He also was in the film ""A Breath Of Scandal"", also made in 1960. A pretty decent year's work for John, I'd say.

Some ""MIDNIGHT LACE"" Trivia.........

>> ""Midnight Lace"" made its theatrical debut at an appropriately ""spooky"" time of year -- premiering shortly before Halloween, on October 13, 1960.

>> The white gown that is worn by Doris Day in ""Lace"" is the very same dress she wore to the Academy Awards ceremony in 1960, when she was nominated for an Oscar trophy for her role in 1959's ""Pillow Talk"".

>> Doris Day suffered a breakdown while filming the movie. In the scene that takes place in the stalled elevator, she became genuinely hysterical and fainted on the set. Production was stopped for a few days while she recovered from the incident. Doris later recalled: ""I wasn't acting hysterical, I WAS hysterical!""

>> Favorite ""Lace"" dialogue:

Doris (""Kit Preston""): ""Who are you? What do you want?!""

Mysterious Voice In The Fog: ""You'll know when the time comes, Mrs. Preston .... just before I KILL you!""

This VHS videotape edition of ""Midnight Lace"" features some nice artwork on the paper-sleeve packaging. Two of the film's original color posters (or lobby cards) are re-produced on the back of the box. The video, which was distributed by ""MCA Universal Home Video"" in the year 1996, contains a Full-Frame (1.33:1) version of the movie, which is modified from the film's original Widescreen ratio. A Widescreen edition would be much better (naturally) -- but I guess fans of the flick will just have to bite the bullet and accept the Full-Frame version (at least until a properly-framed Widescreen edition is made available on DVD in the future, which will no doubt occur sooner or later, knock wood).

Running Time for ""Midnight Lace"" on this VHS tape is 1 hour and 48 minutes. A Hi-Fi Mono soundtrack is provided. Tape Speed is ""SP"" (Standard). The film is in color. No Trailers or other bonus materials are included on the videocassette. This movie is ""Not Rated"" by the MPAA.

222573,4,6300185974,"Doris plays Kit Preston, an American woman who is stuck in London with an attentive businessman husband who is sort of absent-minded in that charming British way.  Tony Preston is played by Rex Harrison, then at the peak of his career and relishing the big box office opportunities that were coming his way after his comeback in Broadway's MY FAIR LADY.  For following the suspicious death of a girlfriend, Harrison had been thrown out of Hollywood in the late 1940s and bounced back to the stage, he and his wife both labelled box office poison for everyone blamed him for the death of our beloved Carole Landis, and others derided Lilli Palmer for sticking to him.

The triumph of MY FAIR LADY was spoiled a bit by the illness of Harrison's wife, Kay Kendall, who died during the filming of MIDNIGHT LACE.  Rex Harrison was notoriously difficult to deal with anyhow, and despite Doris Day's best efforts, she never felt comfortable with him, and he did nothing to hide his contempt for her American accent, and mocked her singing whenever possible.  Perhaps this feeling of being off-kilter aided Day's performance for she was able to turn her wounded feelings into her performance, as a woman alone in a cruel world of British people who are all more sophisticated than her, and the only people who are nice to her are Americans (or played by Americans, such as Myrna Loy and John Gavin).  What do British people make of MIDNIGHT LACE, where everyone English in portrayed as a martinet, a drunk or a nut?

Oh well, Doris' characterization is shrewdly observed and frequently makes the viewer feel she was in real distress.  She had played this type of role before-such as her turn in Hitchcock's thriller THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH (also set partly in London!) and as the air hostess in JULIE, married to the erotomaniac Louis Jourdan.  In LOVE ME OR LEAVE ME she had reached similar heights of paranoia and betrayal, and some have criticized MIDNIGHT LACE for not bringing anything new to her rainbow of roles.  Is it a coincidence that this was her last true dramatic part?  (Well, there was CAPRICE, the spy thriller, but that is as much a slapstick comedy as it is a drama.)  After Kit Preston, she could only have played Medea to feel more pain.  The comfort of cozy cute parts must have seemed an attractive harbor to Doris Day, and of course she did them spectacularly.  Still it's a shame she never again played on our heart strings as she had in the past.",1118275200,3,2466,4.639080459770115

222576,4,6300185974,"This Ross Hunter technicolor production is glossy and sophisticated. It is a perfect, first class showcase for Doris Day, as she takes a dramatic turn in this film. Here, Ms. Day plays the role of Kit Preston, an American heiress newly married to the successful and busy British businessman, Tony Preston, played with panache by the ever dapper and debonair Rex Harrison.
While Kit's wealthy Aunt Bea (Myrna Loy) is visiting them in their beautiful home in London, Kit begins receiving a series of unnerving, anonymous calls, making threats upon her life. After notifying Scotland Yard of the threats, Kit continues to get these calls, which people are starting to think that she made up to get her busy husband's attention. She is also starting to believe that someone is following her and has some unnerving incidents occur, including one in which she is pushed in front of a moving bus and nearly run over.
Who is the stalker? Is it the handsome construction foreman, Brian Younger (John Gavin), working on the building next door, who seems to know Ms. Preston and makes his telephone calls from the pub around the corner? Is it Malcolm (Roddy McDowall), the son of Kit's maid, who is always shaking his mother down for anything he can get? Is it an executive at Mr. Preston's firm, Charles Manning (Herbert Marshall), who seems to be having money trouble and is an old love interest of Aunt Bea? Or could it be Tony, her loving husband, from whose firm someone has embezzled over a million pounds?
The red herrings fly fast and furious in this film, but the discerning viewer should be able to figure out who the crank caller is with relative ease. Notwithstanding this, the film is charming, suspenseful, and well done. Doris Day, beautifully gowned and coiffed throughout the film, is terrific as the unnerved, histrionic heiress, showing herself more than capable at handling dramatic roles. Myrna Loy is wonderful as her concerned aunt who, along with others, is beginning to think that all this is in her niece's mind. Rex Harrison, with his urbane, sophisticated air, is perfectly cast as Kit's successful and well connected husband. Roddy McDowall is excellent in the small role of the malevolent Malcolm, and John Gavin is perfect as the handsome hunk.
This is a stylish, well done film of psychological suspense, deftly directed by David Miller. Fans of Doris Day, as well as those who like a well paced mystery, will enjoy this film.",1046908800,76,2447,4.856459330143541
222577,4,6300185974,"Doris Day was one of the most popular film stars of all time, and ""Midnight Lace"" represents one of her dramatic highpoints along with her starring effort a decade earlier with Kirk Douglas in ""Young Man with a Horn.""  While producer Ross Hunter was better known for glossy commercial Universal Studios hits with Day such as ""Pillow Talk"" with Rock Hudson, this time he combined glossy technicolor and resplendent clothes in which his star was adorned alongside a mystery story in which she is tortured almost to the point of losing her mental balance.
The big mystery that persists is just who is sending telephone messages to Doris Day threatening her life?  She is a wealthy heiress recently married to business executive Rex Harrison in London's fashionable Grosvenor Square when the trouble commences.  Handsome John Gavin, just launching a successful career at Universal, provides sympathy and falls for Day as a construction foreman supervising the renovation of the building next door to where the lovely blonde resides.  Wealthy aunt Myrna Loy, a visitor from the States, does her best to console Day and assist in her effort to uncover the mystery.
The film contains appearances by many top stars and supporting players, such as Roddy McDowall as a spoiled son shaking down his mother, Day's maid, for money, Herbert Marshall as the treasurer of Harrison's company and an old flame of Loy's, attractive Natasha Parry as her neighbor, and John Williams, who solved the murder in Hitchcock's ""Dial M for Murder"" and cracks this case as well.
The film's director, David Miller, demonstrated the same flair for mystery pacing that exemplified his triumph with Joan Crawford in ""Sudden Fear.""  Just as Crawford scored one of her major dramatic successes with Miller in ""Sudden Fear"" in 1952, the same occurred with Doris Day in 1960.

There are few films that keep the attention of my entire family, but this is one of them from the ten-year-old to the mother of the family (whose age will not be mentioned).  This would be a great addition to any film library.  Cheers.",977356800,,848,4.496732026143791
222583,5,6300185974,"Doris Day segued from a successful series of comedy smashes into this, producer Ross Hunter's take on a Hitchcock-style thriller, ""Midnight Lace"".  The pair who had teamed so well in 1959 with ""Pillow Talk"", netting Day an Oscar nomination as best Actress, once again satisfied the masses with this slightly improbable but very engrossing and glossy suspenser. It was one of the big hits during the waning months of 1960.
The story about an American Heiress, Kit Preston, newly wed to Rex Harrison and taunted by mysterious threats from an unknown person(s), has been done before. Is she crazy?  Is she only imagining these taunts as a means of garnering more attention from an unattentive husband or could there actually be someone out to kill her?
While a film buff may be able to see some of the holes in the fabric of the story and guess the ending before the final reel, most moviegoers will enjoy the fast-paced ride they are taken on and will easily get caught up in the events unfolding.
Doris Day is outstanding as Kit.  She again proves her talent as an actress of depth and remarkable skill. She conveys her mounting fears with virtuoso ability, never going over the top into ""hamminess"". The production reportedly had to be briefly shut down after an especially harrowing scene in which Miss Day gave too much to the proceedings. She should have received a well-deserved Oscar nod.
Rex Harrison as her husband Tony is suave and dapper, while Myrna Loy is a delight as Day's Aunt Bea. Mix in Herbert Marshall, Roddy McDowell, John Gavin as well as John Williams, and you have the recipe for high suspense set in lavish surroundings indicative of Hunter's unique film style. Irene's stunning wardrobe, designed for Miss Day, was deservedly nominated for an Academy Award.
If you've only seen Doris Day in her well-loved comedies or earlier musical treats, try ""Midnight Lace"" which capably displays another side to the multi-talented superstar.",971827200,43,1954,4.897280966767371

7804582,4,6300185974,"God I love this movie.. I don't even know why.. I could watch it every other day and not get sick of it.. It has me from the opening scene .. when she's walking home in the ""pea-souper"" fog.. and that weird sinister voice starts threatening her.. ""Mrs. Preston, Mrs. Preston... LOL
Somebody mentioned it sort of has an Alfred Hitchcock look and feel to it.. I  would agree with that.. I think there's several reasons for it.. Doris was in The Man who knew too much (with Jimmy Stewart), John Williams, the Scotland yard detective was in a couple of Hitchcock films.. Dial M. for Murder, To Catch a thief... the husband in this movie is named Tony as in dial M. for murder, the movie also takes place in a London flat, this one much more upscale..the outfits are to die for, there's a few twists here and there and of course an all star cast.. it's a great film.",1522368000,,861,4.314814814814815
