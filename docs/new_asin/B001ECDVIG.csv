3549351,1,B001ECDVIG,"The Germs, in the late '70s, provided horrible, unlistenable drivel for a small sect of pimply, no-taste residents of no-taste Los Angeles, an ugly, charmless city that hopefully will one day drop into the sea along with its name-dropping, backwards residents. Today, the Germs and its thankfully defunct, moronic singer are household names. Why? For the same reason that dull, endlessly self-promoting bores like Henry Rollins and Dave Grohl are household names -- because they live in L.A.

3549354,4,B001ECDVIG,"Let me begin with the disclaimer, I have never been interested in punk rock at all. That being said, why did I buy this movie? I love biographies, I will never know how accurate this was or how much was true but as a movie this was exceptional. This was a troubled young man if you ask me who needed more then those around him were giving him. Was he a ""genius"" I am sure to some extent and somewhat damaged, too. How his ""friends"" could not see him spiraling into some very dark place is beyond me but they seemed to emerge from it. This is what I would call a sad and brilliant film. Now for the performances. all of the players were exceptional and did great. Shane West, the lead who did Darby Crash so well was outstanding, I have always said that this guy is a star and just never got the right jumping off point. this was it to me but apparently never noticed, Bravo, Shane! Why not 5 stars....he had a relationship with ""Robby"" I would have liked that to have been explored more. it was just kind of left hanging in the air and taken for granted.

3549364,5,B001ECDVIG,"A movie about Darby Crash, lead singer of the L.A. punk band 'The Germs'.  He is a complex & memorable character.  I saw him in Penelope Spheris' movie ""The Decline of Western Civilization, Part II: The Punk Years"" way back in 1980, and remember saying to my boyfriend ""I wonder how long he'll be around in this world?""  25 years later, during a bout of insomnia, I thought about about Darby Crash & wondered whatever became of him.  I could not imagine him as a 50 yr old man living a life of normal-formal obscurity, so I climbed out of bed at 3AM & googled his name on my computer.

3549366,4,B001ECDVIG,"Exciting and inspiring and fast-paced look at the creation and dissolution of a legendary punk band.

Darby Crash was a screwed-up kid who nevertheless had vision and drive, and he hooked up with people talented and crazy enough to help him bring his dream to life. The Germs started with nothing, and despite that just went out and slapped the world hard upside the head with the sound and fury they created. That's the central message here.

What cool and maybe even world-changing thing do you want to do, but aren't doing? Maybe this movie will inspire you to do it.

The Germs knew they didn't need anybody's permission or approval or certification, and neither do you. And maybe Darby's screwed-up personal life and tragic stupid death can be instructive, too.

The director's commentary is quite interesting; it shows how DIY this film was, how it was a labor of love for all involved, and how the director, like the Germs themselves, didn't let anything stop him from bringing his vision to the world.

Of course this isn't the complete Germs story. It's a great snapshot, taken from a particular point of view. You can learn much more about the Germs via the excellent Feral House book ""Lexicon Devil: The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash and the Germs"" by Brendan Mullen.",1372464000,2,1289,4.736607142857143

Darby was a seriously torchered soul and I know that's cliche but the man simply could not come to terms with his sexuality and often acted out in his performance what he could not express in real life. His story is sad and I think if someone actually sat him down and said who you are is important and its means something to me, rather not your persona he might of had a chance to continue on.

3549374,3,B001ECDVIG,"I find most biopics shallow and corny, no exception here, but I'm perplexed as to how this one got made in the first place.

I can understand how a movie like, say, Oliver Stone's The Doors came about, since The Doors, beyond just having a cult following, also had half a dozen hit records, toured the world, and have had several books written about them; but who were The Germs? They were a garage band that were together for less than 4 years, put out only one album in that time, were little known outside of the Los Angeles area because they didn't tour, and had little influence outside of a subsection of an already small indie punk scene. While they may have been among the first to play the style of music that would come to be known as hardcore, being the first doesn't mean they were the best; contemporary LA bands like Black Flag and the Circle Jerks were musically a lot better, as were many of the bands that would later come out of the suburbs.

It's true that singer Darby Crash wrote lyrics that were of a higher caliber than the standard rock fare and that he could rightly be considered a poet, but you wouldn't know it from the slurred, unintelligible way in which he sang the songs; I've owned the Germs' G.I. LP since 1987 or '88 and had no idea his lyrics were that good until I happened to read some of them online a few years ago (unfortunately, the record didn't come with a lyric sheet). I was amazed to discover such intelligence in his lyrics because on stage and in interviews, he came off like a stupid, drunken buffoon more than anything. I'd wager that more people have heard of The Germs because guitarist Pat Smear went on to play in Nirvana and the Foo Fighters than for anything the band accomplished during its brief existence. Well, there was that iconic image of Crash lying on the ground, clutching a microphone, black marker war paint dripping down his face and a Maltese cross hanging off his neck, that was used for the poster of Penelope Spheeris's documentary The Decline of Western Civilization, but image doesn't equal substance.

There just wasn't a lot of material to work with here.

I kept thinking as I was watching this that there were far more interesting subjects to make a biopic about than Darby Crash, like Rozz Williams of Christian Death, for example (though I doubt a movie would ever get made about him since it would be nearly impossible to make it a feelgood popcorn movie and since an honest movie about his life would portray homosexuals negatively, which Hollywood doesn't want to do in these politically-correct times).

While I'm no expert on Crash's life or the history of The Germs, the movie seems fairly accurate from a factual standpoint, and fortunately, it doesn't go to town with the rumor that Crash was a homosexual, which I feared it might (though it's implied throughout the movie that he was).

The movie touches lightly on Crash's fascination with Adolf Hitler and fascism (there's something vaguely fascistic in the armbands with blue circles worn throughout the movie), but surprisingly, completely avoids one of the more intriguing facets of The Germs, namely, Crash's interest in cults, Scientology, and mind control. It would appear from some of the things I've read online that Crash admired Scientology's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, and regarded The Germs as an experiment in mass mind control, perhaps even as a cult. I would have found the movie far more interesting if it had spent some time exploring that, instead of taking the safe route of being a formulaic rock star biopic.",1299456000,,3570,4.676751592356688
3549375,5,B001ECDVIG,"Shane West has Darby down pat...movie is good. sometimes cheesy and low budget but thats cool,it's still a good flick. It's about the Germs, come on, they rocked in the day.",1299024000,3,173,4.612903225806452
3549376,3,B001ECDVIG,"Lassoed into watching this thing cause my wife has serious lust issues towards the main actor (Shane West) Been a casual acquaintance with the Germs since I found punk around 1985, but always saw them as more of an acquired taste. They really are pretty atonal compared with the Ramones or Clash, or even the Sex Pistols for that matter. What they did have was that great raw, youth energy which has since been quelled via gaming and Facebook. The film in and of itself was not very good, but kudos go to the folks who slugged it out to get it made. Found a renewed appreciation for the Germs and started listening to them again. It's worth a view....",1296691200,3,651,4.433333333333334
3549377,3,B001ECDVIG,"Some of this movie is exciting, intense and powerful. But it's hard to make a great feature film that retains the power of real life. This was one of those situations. It reminds me of when I saw the movie Dogtown as opposed to the documentary. The features often lose the power and depth of the situation by having to explain it somehow in a couple hours without a budget that can make it more real as far as concert footage, etc. If you want to know more about early L.A. punk this is good to see. You can see the fashion and hear some music and get the basic story of the Germs. I would suggest the book, Lexicon Devil, for those who really want to know the deep inside story of Darby and the Germs. I remember Darby and the Germs from 9th grade and going to shows and parties. The book Lexicon Devil helped me understand it more. Doing a movie about the Germs is so hard to pull off. I think only Scorcese or someone of that caliber could have made it awesome.

Check out my book about growing up as a goofy punk kid in L.A. during the early 80s:

3549378,3,B001ECDVIG,"i know there are those----probably correct---in saying this movie was not what it could and should have been.  still, this is a good flick.  i think it captures the KIND of kids who liked punk as fans and performers and gravitated towards it as a means of self expression, originality and as a way of having something of their own that most in their own generation didn't even acknowledge.  i remember talking to my classmates in 77, 78 about the ramones, clash, pistols, etc. and getting looks like i was from another planet.  punk was, as it says in this film, for those inside the circle.
the one thing i didn't care for was that a lot of the germs' best songs were left off---""american leather"" still sounds fresh and dangerous even today------and i still think crash was under appreciated as a vocal stylist. i remember getting this album and thinking, ""so, america finally has it's own punk band who can be just as brutal as the english"".  without the germs, i'm not sure if anyone would have listened to or cared about fear, black flag, etc.  in his way, his phrasing was more original than joey ramone, joe strummer, or even johnny rotten himself.  with few exceptions who are only pale imitators, there's still no one who does what he did.  hey, for 10 bucks??? see this movie.",1253664000,,1286,4.585152838427947
3549379,1,B001ECDVIG,"IT'S A SHAME REALLY. I SO SO WANTED THIS TO BE A GREAT (OR AT LEAST GOOD) MOVIE. IT REALLY COMES OFF AS NOTHING MORE THAN AN AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL ""LIFETIME"" TYPE OF MOVIE. THEY SHOULD HAVE HAD MEREDITH BAXTER BIRNEY PLAY A PART AND IT WOULD BE COMPLETE.  IT'S VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT PAT SMEAR, LORNA AND DON HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCTION OF THIS MOVIE. ALL THREE OF THEM COME OFF AS THESE MINDLESS ""FOLLOWERS"" OF DARBY CRASH, INSTEAD OF HIS FRIENDS AND BAND MATES. MAYBE THAT'S HOW IT REALLY WAS. LUCKILY I WASN'T THERE. BUT I WAS AROUND THE NYC CITY SCENE DURING THE EARLY 80'S AND I SAW ""THE DARBY CRASH"" STORY OVER AND OVER A HUNDRED TIMES WITH DIFFERENT BANDS. I DON'T SEE WHY THEIR STORY IS SO IMPORTANT. THE GERMS WERE JUST AROUND AT A TIME WHEN IT WAS STILL POSSIBLE TO SHOCK PEOPLE. HELL,THEY DIDN'T EVEN TOUR. I DON'T THINK THEY EVER PLAYED OUTSIDE THE BORDERS OF CALIFORNIA. THE TRAILER FOR THE MOVIE IN ONE PART SAYS ""IT'S MUSIC THAT CHANGED THE WORLD."" NOW PUNK ROCK IN GENERAL MAY HAVE CHANGED THE WORLD...SLIGHTLY. BUT THE GERMS MUSIC DID NOT CHANGE THE WORLD. LET'S BE REALISTIC. DARBY WAS A GREAT LYRICIST, BUT THAT'S WHERE THE INTERESTING PART OF THIS BAND ENDS. I'VE SEEN THE LIVE VIDEOS OF THE ORIGINAL GERMS (NOT THE SHANE WEST BAND) THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND ALL I CAN SAY IS THAT ""I GUESS YOU HAD TO BE THERE."" I GET THE FEELING THAT A BIG REASON FOR THIS MOVIE WAS TO ROMANTICIZE PAT, LORNA AND DON'S YOUTH AND FOR THEM TO TAKE A TRIP DOWN MEMORY LANE. I WAS IN A BAND IN THE EARLY 80'S AND I'D LOVE FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT THOSE DAYS.

THIS MOVIE HONESTLY SEEMS LIKE IT WAS MADE BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT WORK AT HOT TOPIC. IT WAS COOL 30 YEARS AGO. NOW IT'S MAIN STREAM AND BORING. THEY COULDN'T EVEN BOTHER TO FIND GUITARS AND AMPS FROM THAT TIME PERIOD. THE LIVE SCENES OF THE GERMS HAD EQUIPMENT THAT WASN'T EVEN MADE YET IN THE LATE 70'S/1980.
I READ THE BOOK ""LEXICON DEVIL"" (THE STORY OF DARBY CRASH AND THE GERMS) WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY THE GERMS' DRUMMER, DON BOLLES. ALL THE IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT DARBY AND THE GERMS AND THAT WHOLE TIME AND SCENE WERE COMPLETELY GLOSSED OVER IN THIS MOVIE.
THE ONLY BAND FROM THE L.A. PUNK SCENE THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED ""IMPORTANT"" IS BLACK FLAG. THEY DESERVE TO HAVE A MOVIE MADE ABOUT THEM. IF YOU WANT TO SEE A GREAT GREAT BIOPIC ABOUT A BAND, CHECK OUT ""CONTROL"", THE STORY OF IAN CURTIS AND JOY DIVISION.",1251936000,5,2577,4.311340206185567
3549380,3,B001ECDVIG,"I Heard about this Germs/Darby Crash Film for Years. I never really thought the Story was Much for a Hollywood Film. Since its release I Only heard how Bad it was!! I Am here to say its Really Not bad at all, a little Dreary, But not Terrible!

I liked the Interview segments, the Flashbacks & Forwards. I Liked Especially how the sense of ""Family"" was shown. I Always Loved That aspect of the Year One Hollywood Kids, how these Outcasts came together & Formed Their Own Community. It Is a Sad Druggy story, but that was Part of their world. Not as Colorful as I would have Liked to see, But I Think it is a ""Success"" Great Early Masque/Show Excitement. The Guy playing Don Bolles, Totally On Point! He's Still Like That!!

One Weird aspect, that I might have Misinterpreted. Wasn't Michelle Baer the Germs Manager for Most of their lifetime?? They had showed Chris from What? Records as their Long term Manager, & Michelle Co-Produced the Movie!

3549381,4,B001ECDVIG,"I've seen WWDIS three times, and I'm giving it four stars. This is why:

The first star is for tenacity. This movie took something like ten years to make, years of believing in the project, searching for funding, not taking 'no' for an answer -- and all done by outsiders to the movie system. That takes some balls, you know? So kudos to Roger Grossman and Michelle.

The second star is for integrity. This is a labor of love. It isn't tainted by the exploitation that infected other punk movies from the past. It also helps that the original band members were apparently involved, to a degree, in the making of the film. But I would have liked to have seen more of the importance of Malissa in Darby's life, as well as Bosco.

Third star goes to the acting, most particularly Bijou Phillips and Shane West. Nice job.

Fourth star is for portraying the L.A. punk scene, period. Just as then it was ignored by the music industry, today it's apparently of little interest to the film industry. That's too bad, because the energy and originality of that time was amazing. The soundtrack, by the way, is terrific.

The weaknesses:  the movie is too short (perhaps due to financial considerations), and I wish they had focused much more on what it must have been like to have been a young, closeted gay man in a scene that was becoming increasingly macho and intolerant. Darby also comes off in the film as a sort of generic, misunderstood rebel... it would have been truer and more affecting to see the darker, more insecure and controlling side of Darby.

Look, if you love the Germs music, you should definitely see this movie. If you're curious about the L.A. punk scene, see this movie. For further info, I'd recommend the book Lexicon Devil, and if you can find a copy of The Decline of Western Civilization (Part 1), do so. And of course, buying the Germs album. I think a lot of Darby's secrets are answered in his lyrics.",1244073600,3,1925,4.546242774566474
3549382,4,B001ECDVIG,"I remember when I first heard The Germs back in late 1979,80.  That was my first time hearing punk rock music and it bewildered me.  I was 14 and a resident of Los Angeles.  But it left me with the memory of the band, wandereng what is this is all about.  Well, 30 years later, and more diverse and mature, I finally decided to see what the hype was all about.  The Germs were very brilliant, and their leader Darby Crash was a madman/genius!  This movie does it's best to capture that era when The Germs were around and the wild stories and rumors that surrounded them.  There is a lot of performances by The Germs throughout the movie.  The actors do a great job portraying the true life characters.  The live performances are very good too.  Sad to say, this is another rock and roll tragedy if you haven't heard.  But this movie is very real is life gets when you are trying to accomplish something that you believe in.  I recommend this movie to any punk rock fan or the curious who would like to see a true story of a legendary punk rock band that gave The Sex Pistols a ""run for the money""!",1243468800,2,1097,4.246376811594203

I've read a biography about Darby Crash which I consider very good (I can't say excellent because that would imply--to me-- that I was actually there). The link with Joan Jett could have been longer than a quick 1 second shot of a woman zoned out on the floor. How much was  spent on that bit of ""acting""? Anyway, it gets four stars just for the subject matter but loses one for editing. Worth renting but unless you are a major Germs fan, spend as little money as possible on this.",1232928000,,642,4.432203389830509
3549384,4,B001ECDVIG,"First, I'm not going to pretend that I was around LA when all of this went down... I was in New Orleans, and I didn't really get into punk until 1980 or '81, when Black Flag came through. Darby Crash was already dead by then, so I never knew him, met him, or even saw the Germs.  With that said,  the fact that the surviving Germs are happy with Shane West and ""What We Do is Secret"" is enough for me.

I'll be honest though, I would've liked to have seen some more of the earlier years.  Show some more of the time spent at IPS (read ""Lexicon Devil"").  I think that the film does try to project the complicated person that Crash appears to have been.  I do think it comes off short though, perhaps because of the fact that the film itself clocks in around an hour and a half.

The list of people involved in the making of this film is impressive.  It is a who's who of punk in Los Angeles.  This, coupled with the input of the Germs and their immediate circle suggest that the film was credible.

What surprised me though was how many of the scenes of turmoil within the band seemed cliche.  I've no doubt it was, but it still surprised me.

The documentary/ bio-epic presentation is interesting.  I wonder why Grossman decided to do it this way.  I don't know.  If this film had a larger budget and this is what they turned out I would rate this movie lower... but the fact of the matter is that this film had a small budget and took almost two decades to make.  This fact perhaps explains the relatively short length of ""What We Do is Secret"" as well as other shortcomings.

I'm glad this film was completed.  I'm glad its out there and it is absolutely worth seeing, but, if you are a Germs fan you'd see it even if it was absolute trash.",1230768000,5,1742,4.195783132530121

I hope that the movie was fairly accurate because it explains why someone might create music with so much ""hurt"" in it.  I gave it three stars because that is a neutral number and although the material was one star for me it did a five star job at showing the gritty, difficult, unhappy lives that the band members lived.",1229385600,14,583,4.330275229357798

I have seen The Decline of Western Civilization as well as plenty of other Germ performances on video which of course isn't quite the same thing as seeing a live Germs show but its probably as close as most of us will come to seeing and feeling what punk in all of its filth and fury was all about.

The godfathers of punk were Lou Reed and David Bowie and Iggy Pop. LA punk was a fusion of these artist's attitudes and styles. It may seem to all have happened spontaneously but of course it was supposed to seem that way. In actuality punk was just as theatrical as a Lou Reed or David Bowie show. Reed and Bowie shows provided a venue for self-expression and punk shows were the same way. For most punks it was just plain fun to dress up in outrageous costumes and play or attend gigs. But for the hardcore punks like Darby Crash it was more than just dressing up and having a larf.

Whats sad is that Darby Crash was very funny in real life but had very little sense of humor when it came to performing. For Crash performance was a kind of validation and crowd approval was something that he couldn't live without. Unfortunately Crash made his reputation with destructive behavior and the crowd wanted to see destruction every night. And Crash aimed to please.

This film is very good at making the punk scene look like fun. It cleverly casts a very likable actor to play Darby Crash (Shane West looks like Ewan MacGregor) and equally likable actors to play band members (Bijou Phillips is especially enjoyable as the high-spirited and quirky gum smacking ""Lorna Doom""). And most of the film really just feels like a bunch of kids having a good time playing music and creating good punk theatre. And I think for many this is enough to make the film worth their while. However, the film is less successful when addressing the specifics of Crash's motivations, ambitions, his ambiguous sexuality, and his lyrics. Though enjoyable the movie just kind of glosses over these substantive issues and so the ending comes as just as much of a shock to us (even though we know its coming) as it does to fellow band members.

If you don't expect it to be a genuine punk artifact (which it isn't) you might be entertained.",1228435200,4,2338,4.442890442890443
3549387,1,B001ECDVIG,"If this movie has actually helped some people discover the Germs and the old school punk scene, then I guess that's a good thing.

BUT...

This movie has nothing to do with reality.  Far from a realistic portrait, this film presents Darby Crash as a nice, but misunderstood kid who could just as easily have been a supporting character on ""Dawson's Creek"" and makes the L.A. punk scene look like an episode of ""90210.""

Read ""Lexicon Devil"" or watch ""Decline of Western Civilization"" as a contrast.  Or just listen to the Germs.  Just Darby's lyrics on their own illustrate the yawning chasm between who he really was and who Roger Grossman and Shane West make him out to have been.  Even Don Bolles has dismissed the movie as worthless in interviews.

Brilliant, whiny, pathetic, cruel, insecure, domineering, self-destructive, confused, deceitful and very, very sad, Darby Crash was a profoundly flawed and often unpleasant screwed up kid who also happened to write some of the best punk rock lyrics ever produced for one of the scene's most influential bands.

Grossman and West manage to gloss over everything that was difficult, disturbing and most importantly, tragic about Darby.  And in their attempt to lionize him, they paint a bland and sterile picture of an average adolescent who seems like he'd be more comfortable singing for Fallout Boy than the Germs.

As I'm no stickler for obsessive historical accuracy, all of this could maybe - MAYBE - be forgivable if the movie were well-made or had something important to say. But no. It's just an oversimplified whitewash of one of the most complex, orginal and influential artists the punk scene has produced.

If you want a great fictional movie about early punk, skip this trash and go watch ""Ladies and Gentlemen, the Fabulous Stains."" In it's way, that movie says more about old school punk rock than this film ever could.",1225065600,56,1886,4.89622641509434
3549388,4,B001ECDVIG,"This movie is a stellar example of vision, persistence and character on the part of director Roger Grossman, Shane West and Bijou Phillips.  They brought forth a forgotten gem of American history that was overlooked by the assassination of John Lennon in 1980.

I give it four stars because the price is too high for a DVD.  It's not even a special edition.

Buyer beware: Lot's of drug use and mature situations.",1220832000,5,413,4.694444444444445
3549389,5,B001ECDVIG,This movie was awesome.  Finally a movie about the origins of Punk Rock.  Shane West brought Darby back to life.  Must see!,1219881600,6,123,4.5
8297655,5,B001ECDVIG,"Everything about this movie is perfect and if you don't see it right away- you just need to re-watch. The way it is shot- as if with a hand-held camera, home video style - this is the way it should be, it feels so authentic and wouldn't work otherwise. Shane West is a very talented actor and he is perfect as Darby (he was born for this role imo). It is very sad that this movie hasn't gained that big of an audience, because it is certainly worth it.  I have read negative reviews from people who lived in LA when the Germs were there, saying that in the movie they are ""not the same"", but it really is impossible to ""clone"" the originals and IMO the actors do a pretty great job trying. So everyone who genuinely loves the band, their music and for whom Darby Crash is a legend - should be thankful and happy that What We Do Is Secret was created (it took a lot of effort and dedication of the director and all the crew members, you know, since it was an indie project). It really is an excellent ""promotion tool"" for that period of music history and for the punk rock genre in general, it lets people who have never been interested in that kind of music and have never heard of the Germs to discover them and even become fans. After the movie was released, the original band members with Shane replacing Darby went on a world-wide tour for 5 years and all their shows were sold out. It would never have happened without the movie. Circle 2 - that Darby dreamed of- only happened because the movie came out.",1527379200,,1510,4.2613240418118465
8297656,2,B001ECDVIG,this not much of a review I admit.  if you watch the 1st 15 minutes...your curious because you know shane west is a capable actor.  if you watch it to the end your a glutton for punishment.  I like myself too much to have completed it. shane west is still a capable actor.  I just don't have to have had to watch this to know it.  good luck.,1524960000,,341,3.9558823529411766

In the film, other than Shane West, the performances are pretty inadequate. It looks more like a student film than anything.

It was interesting to see Darby Crash return from England and pursue a solo project without the Germs  that was so directly inspired by Adam and the Ants.

Darby Crash is always regarded as an artist with a lot of personal integrity... he just seemed like a charismatic screw up here.",1494028800,,573,4.377358490566038
