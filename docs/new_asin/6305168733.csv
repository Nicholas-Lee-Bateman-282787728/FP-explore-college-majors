7884070,4,6305168733,"The several vaudevillians in KINO's CAVALCADE OF COMEDY appeared in these PARAMOUNT Studio shorts in 1930-31.

SYNOPSES--

AFRICAN DODGER--  This was a carnival performer (usually black, or a white guy in blackface) who stuck his head through a bullseye and dared customers to hit him with a ball. Tom Howard substitutes for the regular dodger in this most unfunny short.

BROADWAY ROMEO--  Jack Benny is a down-on-his-luck con artist running a newsstand. He meets and picks up an equally broke young lady.

CLEANING UP--  Two ex-street sweeper cops attempt to ""clean up"" Clancy St. by going after Public Enemy #1.

FIT TO BE TIED--  While purchasing neckwear, George Burns meets some very odd shopgirls. Gracie Allen sings ""I'm a Whole Lot Wilder Than I Know.""

GETTING A TICKET--  Eddie Cantor humiliates a policeman in court and the cop later writes him a vengeful speeding ticket. Cantor tries to annul the citation by doing a vaudeville routine for the officer and singing ""My Wife Is on a Diet.""

IT MIGHT BE WORSE--  George Jessel's pal wants to poison himself over a lost love; Jessel hopes to convince him to confess to crimes George committed before he does so.

100% SERVICE--  When he tries to buy a cigar, honeymooning George Burns meets the hotel's crazy countergirl (Gracie Allen).

WHAT PRICE, PANTS?--  Vaudevillians Smith & Dale are a clothing manufacturer and his cloth cutter. Smith schemes to steal part of Dale's inheritance by making him a business partner. In a spoof on Prohibition, Dale dreams that trousers are illegal, which leads to a sight gag of NY businessmen walking around in their undershorts. Dale visits a ""pants-easy"" where men illegally don trousers, but the establishment gets raided by pants-less cops.
