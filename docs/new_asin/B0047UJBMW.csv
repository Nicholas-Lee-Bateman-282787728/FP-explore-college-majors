4285452,5,B0047UJBMW,"I'd seen the author on PBS and liked the ""take-it-from-the-beginning process. I've been watching the video regularly and hope to move onto a more advanced level before long.",1336608000,9,173,5.214285714285714
4285453,5,B0047UJBMW,"As seniors trying to stay flexible, my husband and I found this Tai Chi DVD an excellent choice. It is well worth the price.",1309824000,37,124,4.208333333333333
4285454,4,B0047UJBMW,This CD is a very complete but easy to follow version of Tai Chi. The visuals are great. The first time using it I found it was energizing and also relaxing after a few minutes of use. Amazing how one can forget to relax.,1302912000,38,221,4.045454545454546
4285455,1,B0047UJBMW,"I didn't like this CD at all.  It moved too slowly and only showed
very basic positions for the very very very beginner.",1364947200,2,120,4.217391304347826
4285456,2,B0047UJBMW,"As is noted in several reviews, this is a beginning. It is devoted to basic principles and 'relaxation'.  It is not instruction in a sequence. Buyer beware.",1361491200,7,156,4.777777777777778
4285457,3,B0047UJBMW,"It's okay, it must be an intro cd because the whole cd is shown on the cover. It only gives a few different moves. A little dissappointed.",1361232000,4,138,4.148148148148148
4285458,2,B0047UJBMW,This is only warm up for the Tai Chi and it should be said in the title. It was only endeless explanation about the postures and warm up exercises.,1360800000,7,147,4.103448275862069
4285459,4,B0047UJBMW,Beginner at tai chi.  Wanted to try it and also use it as a way to begin activity again after several months of inactivity.  The instruction is clear.  Love the warm up.  I really like the mindfulness that tai chi brings to physical activity and the descriptions the instructor uses to help the user enhance technique.,1359849600,4,318,4.625
4285460,3,B0047UJBMW,Way too slow for the active seniors in my bldg! Instruction given at a snails pace! Even if all you do is walk - this DVD is too slow for you.,1358899200,3,142,3.6129032258064515
4285461,5,B0047UJBMW,"This is helping me with my balance and strength.  His voice is calming and the movements are shown clearly.
I am very glad I urchased this",1357344000,3,138,4.3076923076923075
4285462,5,B0047UJBMW,I was very pleased with this video.  He moves slowly and deliberately which is very good for the beginner or a senior.  Would advise to anyone.,1357084800,2,143,4.461538461538462
4285463,4,B0047UJBMW,"This is very good for beginners. I had stiffness in my shoulder and after doing it a few times, it worked out the stiffness. The instructor doesn't go so fast you have to go over it again and again just to get it. I would recommend this dvd to older folks to keep flexible.",1348099200,10,273,4.074074074074074
4285464,5,B0047UJBMW,My husband and I enjoyed our first experience with Tai Chi by watching the CD.  The teacher is very through with the movements.  We plan to watch and learn Tai Chi frequently.,1345507200,7,175,4.4375
8418311,3,B0047UJBMW,Because the instructor faced us I couldn't follow as well. We needed to watch him from the back.,1434758400,,96,4.388888888888889
8418312,5,B0047UJBMW,"arrived on time, as advertised",1417046400,,30,5.2
8418313,5,B0047UJBMW,easy way to learn tai chi. love it,1416700800,,34,3.375
8418314,4,B0047UJBMW,"Easy to read, small enough to carry for resource in free time.",1408320000,,62,4.25
8418315,1,B0047UJBMW,"It seemed dated,  Tai Chi is Tai Chi I suppose.  I think there is probably better DVD's out there, I will keep looking.",1392768000,,119,4.130434782608695
8418316,1,B0047UJBMW,"Too much time was spent talking about the warm-up, stretch, and arm movements.  He could have moved through that much quicker so more time is spent teaching the Tai Chi Sequence.  When you finally get to the Sequence Chapter it's difficult to follow which way he's turning so it's difficult to truly learn the sequence.  This really is more for a beginner who has never exercised before in their life.  Also, the instructor kept bobbing back and forth throughout the whole DVD - very distracting.  This was money wasted - DVD is in the Good Will pile. :(",1389398400,,554,4.612244897959184
8418317,5,B0047UJBMW,"The DVD goes slow enough my wife and I could learn the movements.
The experience better connects the mind to the body.  This is not
some kind of religious or chanting thing.",1383523200,,173,4.40625
8418318,4,B0047UJBMW,I have enjoyed having this because it just seems to make me slow down and think about the reason I am doing this. Peace,1381795200,,119,4.0
8418319,5,B0047UJBMW,"The dvd came very timely, however it was not as easy as I though it would be. I think the dvd familiarized me with the concepts however I think it works better in a group setting. I would recommend it to people who want to take the time to center themself and tune out the outside noises of this world.",1374278400,,302,4.05
8418320,5,B0047UJBMW,"At 54, I found this DVD to be a great addition to biking and archery because it keeps my joints flexible and muscles supple. Plus, it has really helped my balance.",1367971200,,163,4.290322580645161
