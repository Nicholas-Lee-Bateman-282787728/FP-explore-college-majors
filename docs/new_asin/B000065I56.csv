1707252,1,B000065I56,"Expressionless ""animation."" Lighting effects which would best be described as pallid. Modeling and character design straight out of a bad Dreamcast or Playstation 2 game. A screenplay that is, by turns, smarmy, banal and insensible. Avoid at all costs, unless you want to have nightmares about opalescent polygonal sprites with dead eyes and rigor mortis posture spouting inane faux-saucy dialog.",975801600,,396,5.616666666666666
1707253,1,B000065I56,"Im a HUGE fan of the animation medium, so maybe Im biased when an animated movie comes out that doesnt necessarily follow mainstream expectations for animation.  Sinbad pulls all the qualities together of what makes a good film, and avoids all the looming negative qualities that so often plauge animated films.  However despite some dazzling animation and great character voices, something about it just doesnt quite hit my standard for a great animated film.  Good, but just not quite perfect.  Still, bears repeated viewing and if you even only remotely enjoy animation, get it.",973641600,,581,5.148936170212766

7961017,3,B000065I56,"This is not a good film. I only have because it is a Sinbad film and the first motion capture film. The rendering is murky and the story rather shaky, but worth seeing once to see how it was done in the beginning of motion capture. Amazon seems to have two versions of this, I only have the DVD.",1393113600,,295,4.016949152542373
7961018,3,B000065I56,"Artwork is good, including a cute princess.  Some of the last part of the film is pretty far out, even for a fantasy genre. Small children might be scared by some scenes.",1347321600,,170,4.3125

7961020,4,B000065I56,Though the digital animation may look not so flashy  as tchnology moves rapidly forward.  Overall this is a nice little movie.  The dialog is good the color and texture is sharp and clear.  The music and action can be intriguing with some large scale backgroud shots that invoke a sense of wonder.  It having been made by a non western animators goes far in explaining why it seems differnt from the usual Pixar animation style.,1138838400,,428,4.653333333333333
7961021,3,B000065I56,"This is a movie that the family concensus seems to be that one viewing is enough.  I think that most of us just felt that the art work has to wooden.  I don't know if the technology isn't adequate yet, or if it was just this production that was inadequate.  3 Stars means that we felt the movie was GOOD, not GREAT or WOW!  Some of the artwork was interesting, but the people weren't.  ...",1056153600,,389,4.133333333333334
7961022,4,B000065I56,"""Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of Mists"" is unprecedented in it's 3D motion capture animation.  An evil wizard Baraka puts King Akron under his curse, so Princess Serena goes to great lengths to find someone to help her travel to a faraway land to get the remedy.  She is a strong character and joins Sinbad on the seafaring adventure on a pirate-like ship and she's there every step of the way.  She's not helpless nor wanting everyone else to do everything for her.  Some scenes are a little scary.  I saw this in theaters (limited release), and I tried to buy this rare film soon because I enjoyed it.
I like this movie, and it shows that Disney isn't the only animation company in the world.  I need more independent films like this.  The graphics remind me of PlayStation 2, more specifically the game ""Pirates: Legend of the Black Kat"" because it's about a female pirate.  It's a great alternative to Final Fantasy: the Spirits Within, which is too depressing, although Sinbad doesn't have as excellent graphics.  It might not have the best story in the world, but it's good to watch Sinbad: Beyond the Veil of Mists every once in a while.  Get it if you like independent animation.",1021680000,,1182,4.6124401913875595
