8693307,4,B00QY2HXTO,"The scenic conception of this Ring der Nibelung becomes comic. The ""genius"" director instead of having a ring, as in the title, turns this ring into a glove. In addition it places ballet with hilarious choreographies as in the ""Voyage of Siegfried by the Rhine"". On the other hand musically we are facing one of the best existing versions. Nina Stemme, Ingrid Theorin, Waltraud Meier, Mikhail `Petrenko, Rene Pape, Simon O'Neil, Johannes Krnzle, Vitalij Kowaljow, all perfect, wonderful. My only restriction, very light, is Lance Ryan, the interpreter of the role of Siegfried in Gtterdmerugn gets a bit to be desired. In the opera Siegfried is superb. Wonderful orchestra and Daniel Barenboim confirms that it is the greatest interpreter of Wagner of the present time. A pity is the unfortunate mise en scne. That's why I gave only 4 stars.",1525132800,,841,5.014285714285714
8693308,4,B00QY2HXTO,"Some people like to binge-watch Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones. Nothing wrong with that. My binge-watching material of choice is Wagners Ring Cycle, and since I recently had a holiday weekend combined with Arctic temperatures outside, it seemed like a good time to revisit this Blu-ray set I purchased about a year ago. My impression was more or less the same as the first time I watched it, that this is a vivid and well-executed and on the whole most entertaining performance, by no means an embarrassment to the composer or his enormous ambitions, but falls short of being a go-to Ring Cycle or the one Id take with me to whatever Valhalla awaits. Heres the skinny, or, considering the immensity of the work, the girth.

These performances at La Scala were recorded over a period of three years, meaning some of the roles don't always belong to the same singer. We have two Brunnhildes, two Frickas,  a pair of Mimes, a couple of Fafners, and three different Wotans, one for each of the first three operas (Wotan doesnt appear in the final chapter, although his awesome presence is at all times palpable). One of the drawbacks of this is that we don't get to hear the magnificent Nina Stemme, our Brunnhilde in Die Walkure and Siegfried, deliver the glorious Immolation Scene in Gotterdammerung, but on the plus side were privileged with Irene Theorins dynamic and world-upending (literally) interpretation.

Another problem is that with so many Wotans you're bound to experience some inconsistency, both physically and vocally. As a bass, Rene Pape, our Wotan in Das Rheingold, might seem more suited for the role of Fafner and later Hagen, yet his voice has a certain worldliness and compassion, in addition to self-doubting, that makes it ideal for the role. Plus, the man has such an imposing stage presence that it seems silly questioning his suitability to play a god. Yet any attachment we might feel for his portrayal of the character is betrayed by the time we get to Die Walkure when Vitalij Kowatjow takes over. Not that theres anything lacking in his performance, on the contrary its thunderous and imposing and arguably superior to Papes. But he isn't playing the same character. For one thing, from a physical standpoint he actually looks younger than Pape with his long and wild hair, yet the events of the opera take place well after Das Rheingold. Plus hes more aggressive and sensual in his mannerisms, less pensive and afflicted with resignation, as if he hasn't yet lived through what Papes Wotan has experienced. By the time we get to Siegfried, Terje Stensvolds Wotan, now transformed into the Wanderer, is completely divorced from those previous iterations. It makes sense that Wotan might look a little older by this time, more frail and tired because of what hes been through, despite the fact that hes an immortal who subsists on rejuvenating golden apples, but his appearance in this opera is somewhat jarring, like an aging hobo telling stories around a campfire. Plus the singers voice isn't as rich as his predecessors, it sounds a bit harsh at times, and strained, lacking in intimidation. Overall Stensvold does a nice job, but I see the Wotan of this third opera as still possessing much of his earlier fire, his hubris and his ability to dominate his surroundings, qualities that aren't nearly as evident here with a performer whos so noticeably past his prime.

Our two Frickas go from matronly and long-suffering in Das Rheingold to passionate and aristocratic in Die Walkure, creating a similar sense of schizophrenia. The instability of the cast makes the viewer all the more grateful for the consistency of this cycles Alberich, sung by Johannes Martin Kranzle in one of the best performances of the role Ive ever heard, and seen. But while the cast might lack the stability of other Rings, at least the orchestra and conductor are the same. Daniel Barenboim is a veteran of Wagner, of this score, arguably the finest working today, and his depth of knowledge and insight requires a world class orchestra to achieve fruition, which the La Scala players provide. He takes his time, finding meaning in virtually every nuance of the dense orchestration, and yet the music never seems torpid or bloated. This is a Ring Cycle that shimmers, and breathes, from the croaking birth of the universe that opens Das Rheingold to Brunnhildes sunlit awakening to the crashing and bittersweet twilight of the gods, as profound and multifaceted as life itself.

The revolving door of performers probably won't matter much to viewers whose primary concern is whether or not they can actually sing, and for the most part this cast delivers. As I said earlier, both Brunnhildes are brilliant, memorable, appropriately fiery, and two of the three Wotans are for the ages. The ageless Waltraud Meier takes on three different roles, Sieglinde, Waltraute and one of the Norn sisters, formidable as all three and as one half of Die Walkures incestuous twins nothing short of a revelation. Mikhail Petrenko, our Hagen, has a deep, dark and determined tone with a hair-raising hoi-ho hoi-ho. Like all great Hagens, hes thoughtful and even sympathetic instead of just strictly diabolical, his Machiavellian machinations the result of personal hurts from a dysfunctional (to say the least) upbringing. Petrenko looks a bit like the late comedian Andy Kaufman, and when he was taking his curtain calls I half expected him to say Thank you very much, a la Latka Gravas from Taxi (sorry, I couldn't resist).

Probably the most polarizing casting choice here is Lance Ryan as Siegfried. His is not an especially pleasant voice, its reminiscent of the great Jon Vickers but without his power and vulnerability, most importantly his depth. Like Stensvold, Ryans voice can sound harsh and even strained at times, especially during the more declamatory moments, and certainly during the love duets where his lack of beauty is highlighted against the womens superior strength. This cant be excused by the length of the role because its like that from the moment he first appears onstage. Yet in spite of his shortcomings, Ryan does possess an heroic instrument thats suitable for the part of Siegfried, and eventually I grew accustomed to his voice and was even able to take some pleasure in his performance. At least his tenor doesnt clash with his fellow singers, and you certainly cant fault his commitment to the role, vocally or physically, his face aptly conveying emotions that his singing, not through lack of effort, falls short of. If you want vocal purity, look elsewhere, and I don't know if I would recommend an audio recording with Ryan in this part. But if you can live with a flawed voice accompanied by a performance that immerses itself in the character and his struggles, you might find his Siegfried one well worth experiencing.

Guy Cassiers production is minimalist in terms of props, relying on lighting and projected shadows and other images to achieve its effects, which at times works against the intent of the opera. For instance we never see an actual dragon in either Das Rheingold and Siegfried and thus never have that sense of immediate danger. Likewise, the immensity of the giants Fasolt and Fafner is expressed through their shadows rather than the singers themselves, making them less menacing, which runs contrary to the stomping and fearsome motif Wagner provided for these characters.

On the whole the production is engaging though not especially incisive, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. The Ring is challenging enough on its own that it doesnt require a conceptual approach from the director, especially since such efforts are often clumsy and can get in the way of the audiences own perception of whats going on. Still, it is nice to have some kind of unifying visual motif, such as the power grid in the Barcelona Ring, or the shifting planks in the Mets current rendition, to put across the idea that these operas are as interconnected as the Norns matrix of thread, something thats lacking here.

Not that Cassiers doesnt play around with a few abstract ideas. The most prevalent of these, and maybe the most controversial, is having a group of dancers representing the Rheingold. Its a bit overdone in the first opera, the events onstage often resembling a Bill Blass commercial with a bunch of lithe and beautiful young athletes prancing and lounging around in their underwear. Its recurrence is less demonstrative in the subsequent operas and therefore less distracting, but even so becomes tiresome. And in Gotterdammerung theres a theme of tangled naked bodies and blurred screaming faces projected onto the background which, I assume, is intended to represent the decadence and dessication of the Gibichung clan, or the downfall of the gods, or both. But overall this is a production that doesnt go out of its way to tell you what the Ring is about or try to dazzle you with any innovative ideas. Its a bright and colorful, sometimes garish and often mesmerizing interpretation of a bizarre and mythological world.

As I said, the Ring is a complex work on its own, and there are multiple ways of looking at it. Probably the simplest interpretation is that its about how love is more valuable than wealth or power, that power without any wisdom is doomed to self-destruction, and that the past and future are intertwined and subservient to the inexorableness of destiny. A more esoteric point of view is that the Ring, like the great John Ford film The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance, is really about the artist behind it and his place in the world at the time of its creation. One might argue that Wagner most closely identified with the character of Wotan, a god walking among men whose brilliance, or at least he thinks so, provides him with an exemption from the values and contracts and familial bonds the rest of us have to live by. An alternative to this is that the gods instead represent the old guard of composers, and the fiery destruction of Valhalla is a metaphor for Wagners radical musical vision imperiously taking their place. One of the most amazing things about the Ring is that it invites such divergent translations and yet somehow they all seem valid.

But what impresses me the most about this work is both the scope of Wagners vision and that he was able to pull it off. For instance creating an adequate finale for fifteen hours of such precise musical and dramatic complexity, without an accidental note anywhere to be found, would seem nearly impossible for most artists, but Wagner somehow finds the perfect sendoff. Brunnhildes Immolation Scene is both spectacular and the only solution that makes any sense, bringing together all the important motifs into a complex tapestry of sound. For me its not only the greatest ending in all of opera but the greatest music, twenty minutes of sheer glory that almost functions as a mini-opera within the larger work, a stunning compendium of what weve already seen and heard, both exhausting and exhilarating. For me the Ring Cycle is the pinnacle of opera, of music, dare I say it, of art, and the fact that the man responsible for it was so detestable in his personal behavior, such an unmitigated egomaniac, makes its vast and munificent humanity all the more miraculous.

If you're a collector of Ring Cycles, like me, then this La Scala version is a healthy addition, but if you're interested in only one, Id still recommend Barenboims earlier excursion from Bayreuth which is even more minimal and much darker but more consistent in its performances and quite frankly more meaningful. The highlight of this set is definitely Die Walkure which is nearly perfect, in fact I don't think Ive ever experienced a better performance. Cassiers vision hits its stride with this opera, dispensing with any overly eccentric touches and simply stepping out of the way, and the singing-acting is at its best and most enlightening. Each of the remaining operas is flawed on some level but not to the point of detriment. This is still the Ring after all, and under maestro Barenboims direction it will always be a wonder for the senses.",1515024000,2,12159,4.911435523114355
8693309,4,B00QY2HXTO,"Wagners mammoth opera tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen is impossible to stage perfectly. No one production has all the answers to the multiple problems set by the composer and this Guy Cassiers version for La Scala Milan recorded between 2010 and 2013 is as imperfect as any in the catalogue. However, it does successfully carry out the primary golden rule of any worthy Ring production which is to accentuate the mythology so cutting to the very essence of the piece. On this count alone the production is well worth seeing.

Too many productions attempt to set the Ring in a precise time and place in order to impose some kind of directorial thesis on what the work means to us today. Some of these attempts are trite and laughable while others are stimulating and thought-provoking, but when all is said and done the Ring shouldnt be narrowed down. It is not just a pseudo-GBS parable on 19th century industrialization (Patrice Chreau, Bayreuth 1976). Neither is it just an expos of late 20th century consumerism (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, Munich 1987) or a history of 20th century feminism (Casper Ben Holten, Copenhagen 2006). And it certainly isn't simply a sterile traditional museum piece incarceration of some idealized fake mythic past (Otto Schenk, New York Met 1989). Wagner set his work in timeless mythology because he wanted to accentuate themes and central truths about human nature which stay eternally relevant in any time and in any place. Any production attempting to get to the heart of the piece must ensure that the sets, costumes and props chosen underline this core requirement.

Cassiers stays faithful to the spirit of Wagner with his idea of a wall of myth in which human bodies are entwined together in the manner of an enormous fresco as might have been created by Peter Paul Rubens. These bodies sometimes move and are often static as they make for a perpetually changing fantastic tableau that is revealed in various cunning ways gradually as the Ring plays out. It becomes clear that the characters on stage gradually take their place in this tableau as their lives run their course. Things become crystal-clear at the end of Siegfried which concludes with Brnnhilde and Siegfried singing their hearts out in gray clothing atop a gray Valkyrie rock in front of the (for now) gray wall of myth, their place in mythology miraculously petrified before our very eyes.

Gtterdmmerung charts how devious mankind perverts this mythology for its own selfish ends. In the Norns scene the rock is stripped of mystery as the rope snaps and the wall of myth becomes a hideous showcase of gruesome hacked-up body parts which represents the treacherous world of the Gibichungs. The process by which characters die and take their place in the tableau is shown with amazing clarity in the filmic images projected onto the wall of myth during Siegfrieds funeral march, and indeed this production is full of ever-changing very colorful lighting and projected filmic images which accompany the stage action from beginning to end.

Sometimes things get too complicated and distracting as what we see works against what we hear. Despite all the high-tech Cassiers still cant manage a scary dragon in either Das Rheingold or Siegfried. Even the frog is botched, though Grane makes a rare and very beautiful appearance at the end of Gtterdmmerung. Das Rheingold is the most problematic of the four stagings with only the appearance of Erda rising high above a moon-lit vista of mountains striking the appropriate note of mythic awe. I cant agree at all with the Rheingold ending as staged here with music conveying the irony of the Gods marching into Valhalla while we listen to the Rhinemaidens lament set to a jet-black stage with the Gods and Valhalla complete hidden with only Loge visable at the stage front playing the now customary (clichd?) role of stage manager. The irony of the music should be matched with the irony of the stage picture, not just a cop out in the dark which seems to be an economic measure to sidestep the problem of creating a rainbow bridge. From Die Walkre onwards though, Cassiers chosen stage imagery on the whole cunningly matches the narrative as it proceeds. Wisely things are always hinted at rather than directly hit over the head and we really do sense the physical geography of Wagners creation which so many other productions simply ignore  the bed and banks of the Rhine, the mountain tops, the forests, the Valkyrie rock, the magic fire and all the other natural elements as well. Costumes and props are carefully chosen to avoid any hint of historical time as we are encouraged to interact with the text with the sense of also being a part of this mythology in the making. This is perhaps the key point  that myth isn't just something created long ago in the dim and distant past. It is something that is forever in the process of being created. Present events cumulatively add up to the myths of the future. This comes over extraordinarily well in Cassiers final image as we are placed squarely in the La Scala audience as the lights go up to contemplate the wall of myth stretching across the stage front in the full glare of the light of our own reality.

Imposing a sense of myth by crafting a production around one central visual idea is hardly original. Gtz Friedrichs time tunnel (Berlin, 1980) and Harry Kupfers worlds highway (Bayreuth, 1988) both stated the Rings mythic timeless dimension very effectively, but they both imposed a dark monotony on proceedings which audiences found hard to take. Cassiers wall of myth is far less immobile and dreary as it is moved up and down, side to side, split into pieces and transformed into multiple guises. There is darkness when required just as there is extraordinary brightness which makes this Ring the most colorful in my experience this side of Keith Warners Tokyo production (2001-2004).

Where Cassiers production falls seriously short is in the lack of stage direction given to the singers. Too often singers simply stand still and sing their lines in the manner of an oratorio given in front of all the high-tech images with characters barely relating to each other at all. On this point Kupfers Bayreuth production wins hands down and remains for me the finest Ring on DVD. Kupfer captures the timeless mythology of the piece albeit starkly with very little on stage by way of props and scenery, and he moves his singers supremely well forcing the weight of the drama and all its themes through the acting and the singing to make for a Ring that above everything else is deeply human. The comparative stasis and dramatic inertia of Cassiers production is shown up especially in scenes 2 and 4 of Das Rheingold where characters stand on a crowded stage declaiming their lines directly to the audience as if their colleagues don't exist, even when the text demands they address each other. On Loge singing Deiner hand, Donner, entsinkt ja der Hammer! [From your hand, Donner, you're dropping the hammer!], he walks past Donner without even looking at him. Donner doesnt react at all and isn't even holding a hammer. This makes absolute nonsense of the text. Alas, it is commonplace in Wagner production these days and Cassiers makes a habit of flagrantly disregarding text throughout his Ring, another screaming example being the setting of the ride of the Valkyries. If theres one thing the scene needs its movement or at least the suggestion of movement. Cassiers Valkyries are statues in a ride of the Valkyries that doesnt even attempt to ride.

The lack of stage direction for the singers brings out the difference between the experienced ones who have learned their trade from people like Kupfer and Chreau and who instinctively know how to react, and the relatively inexperienced ones who haven't learned their trade from such masters. In the first camp there are John Tomlinson (Hagen), Waltraud Meier (Sieglinde, the Gtterdmmerung Waltraute and 2nd Norn), Nina Stemme (the Walkre and Siegfried Brnnhilde), Anna Larsson (Erda), Simon ONeill (Siegmund), Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke (the Rheingold Mime), Gerd Grochowski (Gunther) and Mikhail Petrenko (Hagen). All of them have a sure instinct for what their roles require and act with a conviction not apparent in the rest of the cast. Wotan suffers most seriously of all with all three singers hardly hinting at the depths of emotion crucial for the role. Vitalij Kowaljow (in Die Walkre) especially is in dire need of being told what to do on stage with important passages like the act 2 monolog and the act 3 farewell to Brnnhilde passing for nothing despite being well sung. Also stiff and noticeably plank-like are Johannes Martin Krnzle (Alberich), Stephan Rgamer (Loge) and especially Lance Ryan (Siegfried). All three should dominate the stage but never do.

Much criticism has been leveled at the dancing Cassiers chooses to inflict on us, and I cant stand it either. Im certain Wagner would have cringed, especially during Das Rheingold where we are forced to ponder all the vague gesturing while we should be paying attention to the text and listening closely to the music. Its all very distracting, but at least the dancing does originate from an interesting idea. The figures seem to come straight out of the wall of myth as representatives of change. Presenting the Tarnhelm as a group of dancers makes this obvious and leads eventually to a wonderful coup dthatre at the end of Gtterdmmerung act 1 when Siegfried changed to the form of Gunther steals the ring from Brnnhildes finger, done here by Siegfried standing aside watching the dancers (the Tarnhelm) smother the victim with a black cloak. Theres something wonderfully sinister here which is most impressive especially as most other productions tend to botch the scene. In Das Rheingold though sadly the dancing gets out of hand and threatens to smother the whole show. We don't need it for the three changes of scene (especially with very audible splashing of water) and we certainly don't need an already cluttered stage cluttered even more with unnecessary bodies doing unnecessary things. Alberichs transformations into a dragon and then a frog done by dancers surrounding him is both unconvincing and laughable. Nikolaus Lehnhoff in San Francisco (1990) and Keith Warner in Tokyo both show how terrifyingly well it can be done. The dancers hardly appear from Die Walkre onwards and it would benefit the whole tetralogy if they were cut completely from Das Rheingold as well.

Musically this Ring is frankly uneven and people shouldnt expect too much. Since the 1950s the quality of Wagner singing generally has been on a downward slide and today true heldentenors and dramatic sopranos are as elusive as the Holy Grail. The La Scala orchestra and chorus conducted by Daniel Barenboim are beyond reproach and produce a fabulous rich sonority though personally I'd prefer faster tempi with more fire in the belly. The singing predictably ranges from the excellent to the excruciating. Generally those mentioned above for their acting also produce the goods vocally. Tomlinsons malevolent Hunding is gloriously venal while Waltraud Meier delivers a stunningly feminine Sieglinde. Her act 3 O hehrstes wunder! is delivered with enormous maternal compassion as she cradles the splintered Nothung as if the sword is the baby Siegfried himself. As Waltraute in Gtterdmmerung she sings her Brnnhilde off the stage underlining the parallels with the closing immolation scene in an incredibly moving way. Nina Stemme makes a bright-voiced and steady Brnnhilde in the middle operas which eclipses for me her Glyndebourne Isolde. Shes in a class of her own today as a dramatic soprano. The best singing in Das Rheingold comes from Ablinger-Sperrhacke as Mime. A beautifully characterized vignette, he should really have been singing Loge instead and even the Siegfried Mime, though Peter Bronder there makes a good fist of the role. Overall Die Walkre is the best sung of the four operas, wobbly Valkyries aside. Despite the wooden acting (probably not his fault) Kowaljow sings accurately and firmly as Wotan as does Terje Stensfold as the Wanderer. Wotan is voiced best of all in Das Rheingold by Ren Pape who shows off an extremely beautiful noble tone. He seems rather stiff to me though. Perhaps like many of the others hes suffering from not knowing what to do on stage. A lot of the singing is on the safe side with notes hit accurately and lots of glances at Barenboim as he slows down even more to let his singers negotiate the more difficult passages. This is especially true of Lance Ryan who would have done better to relax and play the lout more. He certainly looks the part and is probably the best Siegfried weve had since Siegfried Jerusalem, but he is no natural heldentenor and the search is still on for a modern day Wolfgang Windgassen. Rgamers Loge and Krnzles Alberich are both sung well without hitting the heights or being very characterful. Watch the Kupfer Bayreuth production and you realize they don't really stand comparison with Graham Clark and Gnther von Kannen. Indeed, role for role and even note for note coming from the orchestra pit, the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring is still the one to go for. Nevertheless, if you fancy a Ring in state of the art modern sound in a production that gets most of the essentials right the Cassiers version is a fair recommendation. Just beware the pitfalls. Its very sad and bitterly ironic that as the quality of stage technology and recorded sound goes from strength to strength, so top quality true Wagner singing becomes an increasingly distant thing of the past.

8693310,5,B00QY2HXTO,"Guy Cassiers staging of the Ring in Wagners bi-centenary year 2013, performed at La Scala and at the Berlin Staatsoper,  received a lot of criticism for its incorporation of dancers  (especially in Rheingold), as well as aspects of the production which many found lacking inspiration and without coherent and consistent meaning.
However, for what its worth to anyone, I would put it far and away the best Ring available on Blu Ray.
The production is a beautiful piece of art. It looks magnificent always, and is fairly straight forward. As for the meaning, I found a great unity of purpose in the constant shifting images of a piece by Belgian sculptor Jef Lambeaux  called Les passions humaines. There was a complex and interesting narrative of modern world references, yet the basic  storyline of Wagners Ring was strongly adhered to. For me, this results in a cycle which is continually beautiful to look at and relevant without departing from Wagners  intentions. It is also durable in terms of home viewing repetition.
The much criticised dancers were not a problem for me. Their morphing into shapes representing the dragon and the tarnhelm where sensitive and stunning . Almost like a living CGI representation on stage. In Rheingold, they provide more ballet type sequences during the interludes which many found annoying. My response was neutral. Dont let their inclusion put you off. If you find them a distraction in the orchestral passages, look away.
Daniel Barenboim is well known as an outstanding Ring conductor. his earlier Bayreuth Ring is regarded by many as the modern classic to own on video. While I agree it is pretty sensationally sung and played, the staging is very politically influenced. I find it intriguing, but for repeated viewing, the gimmickry and message wears a little thin. Here Barenboim conducts a sensational orchestra and cast of singer/actors in beautifully recorded sound. He crafts the sound as a sonic spectacle, without being bombastic. The brass balance is perfect and those chorale like passages of the Walhalla motive from the first Rheingold interlude and the articulation of Hundings theme in Act 1 of Walkure are grippingly memorable. The standard throughout is just as high in other favourite musical moments. Its just beautifully played and conducted.
No Ring cycle cast is consistently perfect. Here it is fairly consistently beautifully sung and very well acted. Some may not warm to Lance Ryans less than elegant vocal style, but he packs a punch and is a commanding stage presence.  (I saw this Cycle in Berlin in April 2013 and Ryan, for some reason not explained, didn't show up in time for Act 1 of Siegfried. Andreas Schager sang Act 1 from the wings, while an assistant director mimed the part on stage. A humble Ryan turned up for Act 2 to deliver a sensational performance. The story made several papers the next day.)
Brunnhilde is shared between Ninne Stemme (Walkure and Siegfried)  and Irne Theorin  (Gotterdammerung), both in magnificent voice and both (especially Theorin) intelligent actors. Wotan is shared between Rene Pape (Rheingold;  in beautiful voice, not a strong character in the Hotter sense but for craftsmanship and subtlety he does a wonderful job. Vitalij Kowaljow  sings Wotan in Walkure; he is solid and  a good actor.  Norwegian Bass Terje Stensvold  completes the threesome with a more than satisfactory Siegfried Wanderer. Waltraud Meier is radiant and wondrous in Walkure as Sieglinde and luxury casting sees her returning as Waltraute in Gotterdamerung (and 2nd Norn!)
There are no real weak links but other outstanding mentions are Stephan Rgamer as Loge, Johannes Martin Krnzle is an amazing slippery Alberich in Rheingold , Gotterdammerung and Siegfried, Mikhail Petrenko as Hagen, Anna Larsen as Erda.
I own a six Ring Cycles on Blu Ray and DVD. All have aspects which make them stand out as special performances but this is the one I return to again and again",1462838400,4,3957,5.059907834101383

Staging was in my opinion generally poor , it detracted from the works message.  Orchestral playing was excellent.  I own the Met Opera Ring with Bryn Terfl as Wotan.

8693312,3,B00QY2HXTO,"I love the music. Daniel Barenboim has done a masterful job (nor surprise) with the orchestra. The singers are truly stunning. But...ah. But. The Rheingold is just unbearable. It's not that I such a hidebound traditionalist. I love the MET's 1990 production--it IS Wagner. But I've seen many contemporary stagings of other operas and enjoyed most of them. (Some I hated.) The other three in this set are as good as a traditionalist can expect. No point here in getting into that debate. At my age, my mind is made up.

My problem, however, is that the quasi-ballet that plagues the Rheingold in this set is distracting and, well, childish. I get it that many people haven't bothered and never will bother to grasp the entire of Wagner's work here. So, okay, producers need to coax them along a bit. But this weaving of arms and butting in just does not work at any level. And, by the way, it's not even GOOD ballet.

I would give this four stars but for Rheingold. The Daniel Levine MET 1990 is at least six, maybe ten, stars. If you only want one, get that.",1453248000,5,1058,4.505208333333333
8693313,5,B00QY2HXTO,"Some time ago a disgruntled reader chided me for my poor opinion of the St Clair/Weimer ""Siegfried"" and my negative opinion of the opera. He said I was ""self indulgent"", or something to that effect. I mentioned that I was 73 years old and could never bring myself to tackle ""The Ring"" and I thought that the above mentioned performance seemed terrible and I could not watch it to it's conclusion. Another reader was more helpful and advised me to try a better performance. I thought about his advice and purchased the Barenboim/La Scala ""Ring"" which is the subject of this review.

What a revelation. I viewed the music dramas in chronological order and the deeper and more involved the saga became, the more transfixed I became and by the time I was at the famous immolation scene in ""Die Gotterdammerung"", I was completely absorbed by the fantastic continuing saga. The quality of the productions which took place between 2010 and 2013 were pretty consistent but with some inconsistencies in some roles. Obviously the same artists were not available for all performances, as the performances were spread over three years, and some notable singers such as Lance Ryan was in better voice in the earlier Siegfried than he was in the later ""Gotterdammerung"". The use of projections on a large screen were brilliantly conceived and executed by the director Guy Cassiers. This was a production which originated earlier at The Staatsoper Unter den Linden, Berlin. Most of the actors were very fine as were the camera work and the sort of strange combination of eclectic costumes. It should be mentioned that the dts hd sound and the blu ray video were both fine and consistent throughout the cycle.

Most of the singers seemed fine but each opera had a few who were less good than the others. From what I understand it is just about impossible today to cast a completely perfect ""Ring"". Barenboim and the La Scala Orchestra were superb. I think this is a good contemporary production without going ""off the wall crazy"" and it was very accessible to a ""Ring"" newbie like myself.

So, you see, you can teach an old dog new tricks or at least you can teach him to love ""The Ring"".

For what they are worth, my comments on the individual music dramas can be viewed elsewhere under the individual performances and should be taken with a grain of salt because, other than the horrible St Clair/Weimar ""Siegfried"", I have no basis for comparison. I am ""fixin"" to change that shortly. After I see a few more ""Rings"" I may have to reevaluate my rating, but until then I give it 5 stars.",1433721600,22,2572,4.708888888888889
