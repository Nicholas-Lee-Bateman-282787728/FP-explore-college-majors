8124441,5,B000FKP1AO,"I completely LOVED this DVD!! Marilyn's death is made to make people believe that she killed herself. Which is believeable when they use the reasoning of an overdose. Because not only had she almost accidently and purposely died from over dose before, but everyone knows that she was fond of champange and barbiutes combanations, but this DVD shows you that it was most likely a murder that was covered up as a ""probable suicide"" After watching this, I really think Bobby did have something to do with her death....",1301616000,3,515,4.797752808988764
8124442,5,B000FKP1AO,"This is actually a pretty good documentary piece on the death of Marilyn Monroe. Gives details that are known and speculates as well as to what really took place there the night of Aug. 4th and early morning hours of the 5th at her home in Brentwood, CA. Many theories are discussed that give the viewer some plausable cause as to what could have happened without blatantly acknowledging a distinct outcome. The length of it is about an hour long and it is in nice color format as opposed to black and whites we are accustomed to on her. If you are a fan of hers and like the documentaries, you may want to add this one.
There are no accusations here and blaming, it is merely a program on which the viewer can watch and review what may have taken place.
Color and sound are good as is most History Channel programs.
If we know all the theories, even the ones that are outlandish, we can sift through them and educate ourselves as to what may have actually happened with this beautiful woman's life at the very end when she had so much to look forward to ahead.",1250640000,3,1061,4.336683417085427
8124443,5,B000FKP1AO,"By now, everyone realizes, based upon interviews with many of the principals involved in MM's death, as well as recently released FBI documents on Marilyn and the Kennedy's, that she did not take her own life. We may never know the truth, but this DVD is excellent and has many fascinating interviews. I highly recommend this DVD to MM fans and admirers, as well as to those who like a good mystery. There is much evidence to at least call for a re-opening of the case, but I think too many have passed on, and the truth of exactly HOW she was murdered will probably never be discovered. Such a shame...I hope her soul can rest in peace, even though she has the stigma of being labeled a ""probable"" suicide.",1163030400,20,707,4.446153846153846
