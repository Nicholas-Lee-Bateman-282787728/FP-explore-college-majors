Interesting and put together very well, good info
but its not anything new.",1350172800,,123,4.636363636363637
8217358,2,B000065AZV,"This is a pretty boring docco on Alien Abductions. I took the chance on it, and am not terribly impressed.
It's just 3 interviews with 3 alien abductees. And nothing else. No video footage or UFO fighting reports. The graphics are virtually non-existent. There's a little bit of 3D graphics that looks like a 13 year old did it, it's that basic.
On the upside however, the interviews with the 3 abductees are pretty detailed and sound genuine. However, this alone doesn't make a good product that will sell. Fact is... and I know you've seen this too... When you watch a docco, you want to WATCH it, and not ""watch someone tell it"". They need to take a lesson from the makers of the ""OZ Encounters"" UFO docco and put in some cool graphics.",1050364800,,739,4.481481481481482
