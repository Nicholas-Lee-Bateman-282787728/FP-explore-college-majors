Not as good as the original 50s Gojira, better than Matthew Broderick's Godzilla (but then, what wasn't?) and it's a totally different animal than the recent Godzilla with Bryan Cranston.

941544,4,6304891784,"This is not a review of the movie; if you're looking at the reviews you already know you like rubber Japanese monster movies, and DESTROY ALL MONSTERS has enough to satisfy any fan.

But there is a confusing array of Blu-rays and DVDs, and Amazon doesn't help matters any by shuffling the reviews of all of them together into one unhelpful pile. Which disc do you want? Unfortunately, you probably want the expensive out of print one released by Tokyo Shock in November, 2011.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destroy-All-Monsters-Blu-ray/dp/B005G7WGFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destroy All Monsters [Blu-ray</a>] Why? That one has the familiar and much superior AIP English soundtrack from the movie's 1969 US release (plus the Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles). It also includes a terrific commentary. It's region-free, too, if that's important to you.

The 2014 release from Tokyo Shock&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destroy-All-Monsters-Blu-ray/dp/B00JQYUZSS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destroy All Monsters [Blu-ray</a>] has pretty much the same video transfer as the 2011 disc, but it doesn't have the AIP English soundtrack; instead it has only the badly-dubbed international release English soundtrack, plus the Japanese track. The commentary is gone. And it's locked to Region A (US). Why? Who knows. Toho can be difficult in its licensing practices, sometimes. If you don't care about the commentary or the AIP English dub, the video transfer on both blu-rays is very good indeed, so the 2014 makes an acceptable and more affordable 2nd choice, especially if you're just going to use the Japanese audio. If that's the case, then save your money and go for the 2014 version.

The DVDs from ADV are both hard to recommend. The original 2000 release has little in its favor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destroy-All-Monsters/dp/B00003IXDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destroy All Monsters</a>&nbsp;Well, the cover art is kind of nice. Some websites claim it is pan & scan with the sides cut off, but it is in fact widescreen, though not enhanced for 16:9 televisions. The picture is pretty attractive overall (the opening and end titles are beat up but in between the print is pristine). It does tend to be a bit on the bluish side compared to the blu-rays. There are zero extras---not even a menu and chapter stops, and only the English international dub is present; not even a Japanese track to be found here. The 2004 ""50th anniversary"" [of Godzilla, not DESTROY ALL MONSTERS] Special Edition is *exactly* the same disc, but it does include a soundtrack CD, so if you like soundtracks you may be interested in this version.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destroy-All-Monsters-50th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/B0001US5TC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destroy All Monsters - 50th Anniversary Special Edition</a>

Speaking of soundtracks, in 2011 Tokyo Shock released a separate CD of the soundtrack&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destroy-All-Monsters/dp/B005TK1T9M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destroy All Monsters</a>, which is probably less expensive than the long out of print 2004 ADV DVD, but check the prices to make sure. I haven't compared them directly, but they both have 30 tracks and appear to have identical track listings to the 1990s Toshiba EMI  / Futureland release of the same score (TYCY-5353). I'd be shocked if they were different. Toho Music also released a ""Godzilla 50th Anniversary Perfect Collection 2"" CD set that included the DESTROY ALL MONSTERS soundtrack in 2004 (G-009). That disc added another 11 tracks to the standard set of 30, but those are mostly alternate takes and nothing of major substance.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50th-Anniversary-Godzilla-Soundtrack-Perfect-Collection-Box-2/dp/B000IMQB9O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50th Anniversary Godzilla Soundtrack Perfect Collection - Box 2</a>&nbsp;Good luck finding a copy of that one.

941730,5,6304891784,"Destroy All Monsters is one of my favorite movies in the Godzilla series, and since I am a completionist, I wanted to get all available copies of the movies.  I already had the Tokyo Shock and the first ADV DVDs, and the only one missing was the 50th Anniversary Special Edition.  I thought the 50th Anniversary Special Edition looked cool, and with the soundtrack as a 2nd disc, I had to get it.  I kept watching to see the price go down from the outrageous $130-$70-ish prices it was going for, so when I saw it at $15.99, I went and bought it immediately.

The movie is a classic, with 11 different monsters starring in it, King Ghidorah attacks, the cliche alien invasion story for Godzilla, and fun characters.  I didn't find anything wrong with the movie, just '60s Godzilla fun.

The 50th Anniversary Special Edition came out in 2004 for Godzilla's 50th anniversary.  It has a cool kind of metallic ""shininess"" to the cover, spine, and back cover.  The first disc itself is no different than the first ADV release, with no menu, subtitles, or anything, it just goes straight to the movie.  The second disc is the soundtrack and the main reason I wanted to get this version badly, because I don't have a complete soundtrack to this one.  The soundtrack doesn't disappoint and it helps move the movie along.

I would recommend this copy if you do not have it.  Just the look of it alone is enough for me to want to get it.  The soundtrack as a bonus disc is awesome.  I prefer the Tokyo Shock version over this because of bonus features,a main menu, and language/subtitles options.  Still worth buying if you're a Godzilla fan.",1436832000,3,1632,4.560137457044673

941794,4,6304891784,"The first all-star monster rally.  Originally intended as an environmental essay on undersea farming, Toho boiled down the story to the barest of bones, leading to another disappointment for director Ishiro Honda, who nevertheless imbues the production with his usual stylistic touches.  At heart a family-oriented film, Honda adds touches of real human drama and tragedy supplemented by marvelous special effects supervised by Sadamasa Arikawa with a rousing score from Akira Ifukube.  For many years - and perhaps even to this day - it is considered as the most popular of all the Godzilla films, no small achievement.  The picture quality is good but unfortunately the American dub is not the original AIP version; however it does also contain the original Japanese soundtrack.

941892,5,6304891784,"Okay, I am not sure what kind of DVD people have been talking about cause the info they display was not the experience I have had.  Every review I have read on this DVD said the following, 1) Mono Sound, and 2) Japanese Only audio (this is written in DVDs description as well).  This is Not true, the DVD does support 2.0 stereo sound version of a English dub, as well as the original Japanese audio.  So you can experience the film in both its Original, and a Americanized form.

As a fan of both watching films and Godzilla, I can find it easy to enjoy even the worst of Godzilla movies, looking at you ""All Monsters Attack"".  With that I also was very excited to see this film cause it is the only one I never got to see.  This is due to how old I am and poor timing for me with all the old Godzilla Marathons they use to run on TV.  I have to say this film was alot of fun to watch, it terms of how great it is, its okay.  I say this cause the plot is simple, the best part of the film is the ""All out Monster Brawl"" near the films end where we have multiple Monsters battling at once.  When you get to it, it might not live up to the hype it was given to you.  This is very forgivable though when you know how complicated this kind of scene was to make.  The scene requires the ability to choreograph a full fight scene without getting wires tangled (One monster on set required over 20 alone!) Timing explosions and monster reactions to fit just right.  This is a massive undertaking since the Kaiju actors actually can't see a thing, all their motions are acted out over and over again until they have it memorized (this is why in most monster films they run and hug, so they know where their target is).  When you look at the final battle with this in mind, you can start to understand why this scene is highly regarded as the best to ever be made.

Plot wise it has a very simple idea, All monsters on earth are put on a island so they won't cause anymore harm (the birth of Monster Island).  One day something happens and the monsters start going all across the world destroying famous cities.  It is discovered that these attacks are not just a bunch of Monsters running a mock and time is shortly running out to stop those responsible.  It actually is a decent plot which has some intense moments in terms of ""What city is next"" and a ""who can be trusted"" mood to it.  But many may find the real casual way things are taken and accepted as a little far fetched, and just a means to move the story along to what they want you to really see (the final fight).

Audio:  Now I have not watched the Japanese version yet, but the English dub is actually not that bad.  I have seen worse in a Godzilla Dub.  Naturally there are some voices that just don't match at all with the characters or are phoned in terribly (there is one guy who might as well just add ""I'm old"" to his sentences the way he was making him sound).  It came in nice and clear, no issues with the sound track, and I didn't need to make any adjustments to the tv to insure a good listening experience.  In a way I would describe it as if I was watching it on a TV broadcast.  As far as I am aware I don't think its the Original Dub that was made when the film was brought to the US, but they did indeed gives a English dub in case you A. don't want to read subtitles, or B. like me like to do other things while watching a film and would like a English track so you don't need to watch the screen.  I read in some reviews that its a Dub produced by ADV and if this is the case then WOW a ADV dub that didn't include Tiffany Grant (Not to knock her I love her in Evangelion, but damn is she easy to pick out since she only does one voice).

Picture: Nice and clear no issues with the images, everything was as sharp as they were the day the film was aired on TV.  This is not some bootleg where the colors look faded, or is out of focus or has points that you can clearly tell was where a commercial break was cut out.  This is a Real Deal release.

Presentation:  Media Blasters a while back had gotten the rights to Voltron and planned to create a whole new launch of the show including the film ""Fleet of Doom""  from what I hear form one of the their shows producers, they put all their chips into this venture and it flopped big time.  The result was all Anime they were dubbing at the time turned to Subs, causing any of their Anime series to go from English to Japanese halfway through.  So long story short they cut corners when they can.  With this it was the DVD menu/case.  Nothing much here just the DVD cover and a Play, Set up, and Chapters options, and the chapters are very few.  So nothing impressive but enough to do the job.  At the very lest they put up the cash to get the rights to a English Dub which is a major plus.  The DVD case is a little miss leading, to be honest when I first saw this on Amazon, I thought it was a Bootleg and wasn't sure if it was a legit release, heck Media Blasters didn't put their logo on the thing!  It also didn't help that for the longest time the only way to get this film was to buy a cheap rip from a VHS copy that someone recorded off their TV.  So if your concerned don't be this DVD is the real deal.

All in All this was a fun movie to watch, was it the best Godzilla film ever made?  Depends on who you ask, for me I would put it in my top 5 if I made a top 5 of my favorite Godzilla films.  Was it worth the 20 year wait to finally see it? Yes, yes it was.",1426464000,,5494,4.019337016574585

941894,5,6304891784,"Just finished watching; along with Jeff H., ""Destroy All Monsters"" released by TokyoShock.
Because some have asked what Jeff H. thinks of all the Godzilla movies he's watched along side of me; he asked me to convey his one word review of this particular entry in the Godzilla franchise:  ""EPIC!""
Perhaps the most popular entry from the early years of the Godzilla franchise, ""Destroy All Monsters"" is also noteworthy because it was directed by Ishiro Honda, who directed the first original Godzilla movie, and the ""dream team"" of special effects supervisor Eiji Tsuburaya, composer Akira Ifukube, and produce Tomoyuki Tanaka.
Set in that fantastical future year of 1999, ""Destroy All Monsters"" begins almost as a documentary where a helicopter is flying over Monster Island.  Humanity has finally managed to capture and contain Godzilla, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, Anguirus, Minilla, Kumonga, Baragon, Gorosaurus, Manda, Varan, and even Godzilla Junior on Monster island through various and unique sonic and various sensory forcefields which keep the monsters contained.
There is even an international moonbase which monitors Monster Island.
No one in their right minds would ever let the monsters loose from Monster Island.  Well, no one except sexy space women from a hidden world in our Solar System who are bent on conquering the Earth and enslaving humanity!
I think this was an interesting reversal from ""The Mysterians"" - also from Toho Studios where alien men wanted to interbreed with Human women - because the women also capture Human men in order to procreate.
It's up to the captain from the moonbase and his stalwart crew to conquer these evil space women and send them packing.  Of course, saving the Earth and Humanity also means somehow herding Godzilla and friends back to Monster Island and re-establishing the protective forcefields.
Great Godzillia fun!
Highly Recommended!

THE STORY: In the future year of 1999, aliens operating from a secret subterranean base on the Moon free all of Earth's monsters from their confinement on a remote south Pacific island code-named Monsterland. INTERPOL agents enlist the help of several scientists and astronauts to combat the aliens and put a stop to their evil plans to wipe out mankind and rule the Earth. Can our heroes succeed, or will we become their helpless slaves? Only the combined might of Godzilla and his monstrous companions stands a chance of turning the tide!

THOUGHTS: The penultimate Japanese Giant Monster movie. Everyone who's anyone in the Toho monsterverse gets in on the act. Even 3rd tier kaiju such as Manda & Varan get cameos. While it's not the best Godzilla film, the sheer volume of monSTARs in this flick make it well-worth the price. Designed to appeal to the kid in all of us. Try and find a young boy who doesn't love this film.

THE DVD: The high-def Blu-ray edition of DESTROY ALL MONSTERS looks & sounds very nice here. Also included are trailers, promotional image galleries, and a very interesting & informative full-length running audio commentary by noted Godzilla scholars Ed Godzisewski (yes, that's his real name) and Steve Ryfle. These two gentlemen are life-long Godzilla fanatics who have written books on the subject of Japanese giant monsters and have contributed countless articles in various magazines over the years helping to keep the flames of fandom burning.",1424736000,3,1729,4.975778546712803

942313,5,6304891784,"While it's great to finally own a DVD copy (or any copy for that matter) of DAM, this 2014 release has some good things but some bad things. First off I highly recommend the now out of print Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock's 2011 DVD release, as it's jam packed with a ton of extras, with great quality etc. Second, as good as it is to own it, this new release is lacking; however it's completely understandable/justifiable after the trouble MB went through, which I will explain later on. So lets get started...

Plot: The year is 1999 (remember this came out 1968) & all of the world's monsters have been captured, & placed upon Ogasawara Island AKA: Monster Land. It's sort of like a prison, the monsters are shelled in using various barriers (it's pretty strange, yet cool). Suddenly things go awry, & the monsters begin attacking various cities around the world.

Monsters: While not all of Toho's classic monsters are present, remember this was made in 1968. There still is quite an abundant of creatures.
Monsters present include Godzilla, Minya (Godzilla's son), Anguirus, Rodan, Varan, Mothra, Baragon, Kumonga, Gorosaurus, Manda, & King Ghidorah.
The monsters not present include Meganula (from Rodan-1956), Moguella (Mysterians-1957), Abominable Snowman (Half Human-1955), Orochi (3 Treasures-1959), H-Men (H-Man-1958), Maguma (Gorath-1962), Mushroom people (Matango-1963), King Kong (King Kong vs Godzilla, King Kong Escapes), Frankenstein (Frankenstein vs Baragon), Gaira (War of the Gargantuas), Sanda (War of the Gargantuas), Giant Condor (Godzilla vs the Sea Monster), Ebirah (Godzilla vs the Sea Monster), Dogora (Dogora-1964), & Kamakuras (Son of Godzilla).

How monsters that previously died in earlier films such as Anguirus, & Gorosaurus alive, is never clear, the only thing we can assume is that another monster of the same species survived, or something. Some monsters such as Varan, & Baragon only have brief cameos. However most of the monsters do have a good enough amount of screen time. owever the film focuses more on the human characters trying to gain control of the monsters (they're being controlled by aliens), & while this may seem like a bad thing, there's still plenty of action, you've got gun fights, some lasers, & yes, the monsters show up every now & then. Overall the film still holds strong, & is better (in my opinion), than the 2 previous installments of the franchise (Godzilla vs the Sea Monster, & Son of Godzilla). The acting is decent, the dubbing kinda is, the art direction is top notch, Ifukube's score is fantastic (as always), the dialogue is okay, overall Destroy All Monsters is a fun, solid, Kaiju flick. I saw it as a kid, & wore out my VHS tape, because I watched the film so often, as a kid, DAM, Gojira or Godzilla King of the Monsters, & King Kong vs Godzilla were always my favorites.

Media Blasters struggle with their 2011 release: Apparently MD released the dvd with extras not approved by Toho, so Toho sued them or something. The dvds were recalled, why Toho did this exactly is weird. It's not like it's anything against the studio or something, but whatever.

Fun Facts: Originally meant to be the last Godzilla film, of course it wouldn't be, if you count the films Godzilla has been in, he's starred in over 30 (if you count the awful 1998 film, & the decent 2014 film), & he'll probably be in more. There's plans to take a sequel to the 2014 film, Toro claims that it may have a plot similar to DAM. There was an initial screenplay with the preliminary title All Monsters Attack Directive, which would have many of the same elements used in the final product. The difference, however, was in the monster line-up. This first draft included several monsters that would appear in the final film, such as Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, Rodan, Baragon, Varan, Kumonga, and Manda. The final two monsters were Maguma (from 1962's Gorath) and Ebirah (from 1966's Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster). Maguma was to be one of the guardians of the Kilaak base with Baragon, who would have been the ones to fend off the SDF. Ebirah's role is unknown. The films title was later changed to Kaiju Soshingeki (Charge of the Monsters), and Ebirah and Maguma were replaced with Anguirus, Minilla (Godzilla's son) and Gorosaurus. In the American release 2 scenes were deleted (restored in this release because it's the most completed version, the International version), these scenes include  Opening credits; Moved to the end of the film and changed to white credits against a black background with the original Ifukube cue, Shot of Minilla covering his eyes while King Ghidorah drops Anguirus. This is the 9th film in the Godzilla franchise. A deleted scene shows Godzilla wrestling Manda (deleted scene is on Youtube).

942371,2,6304891784,"This review is more about the actual product being released than the movie itself.

About 3 years ago, this movie was released on Blu-Ray and DVD by Media Blasters. It came with 2 sets of English dubs and the Japanese audio. Additionally, it had some special features. Sadly, it was so under-produced, the price sky-rocketed and is difficult to get.

Fast forward 3 years to a successful Godzilla movie. Media Blasters got smart and decided to re-release this movie on Blu-Ray and DVD again. This time, which they also forgot to mention to the public, it is a bare-bones release with only the International Dub and the Japanese Audio. Call me a ""fan-boy,"" but I grew up on the AIP Dub that they put in the original release 3 years back. The AIP Dub has a much better vocal track and isn't as campy sounding as the horrendous International Dub.

We, as fans, got the shaft from Media Blasters. They gave us a re-release, but stripped everything away that made this a great release the first time around.",1410134400,2,1002,4.617977528089888

942374,4,6304891784,"""Destroy All Monsters"" has long been a fan-favorite movie among Godzilla fans and fans of the kaiju genre in general for decades. It features Godzilla, Anguirus, Mothra, Rodan, King Ghidorah, Baragon, Manda, Varan, Gorosaurus, Minilla, and Kumonga all in one film. This monster total was only surpassed by one film, 2004's ""Godzilla: Final Wars"", a film not nearly as beloved or well-received as this one. For years now ""Destroy All Monsters"" has only been available in North America on VHS containing the atrocious English dub of the film with some scenes edited out, or on a cheaply-made but incredibly overpriced DVD that is simply the earlier VHS release ported to a different format. This version, released by ADV Films, was the version of ""Destroy All Monsters"" I grew up with. Ever since Tristar began releasing the uncut Japanese versions of the Godzilla movies on DVD in the early 2000s, I craved a new and better release of ""Destroy All Monsters"" on par with these other DVDs. In 2004, ADV released a special ""Anniversary Edition"" of the movie on DVD, only for it to simply be the earlier release in a new package.

By 2013, I had a complete collection of all of the Godzilla movies (excluding the elusive ""The Return of Godzilla"") on DVD, most of them in good video-quality releases featuring the uncut Japanese versions of the films. ""Destroy All Monsters"" was the worst item in my collection. It was an outdated DVD with no menus, a terrible audio track, and poor video quality. When I learned that Tokyo Shock, the company responsible for the excellent DVD release of ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" had released ""Destroy All Monsters"" uncut on DVD, I scoured every store I could find in search of this new release. After months of fruitless searching, I checked Amazon and sure enough they finally had it available. I quickly purchased it and it arrived in two days. What did I think? It is a monumental improvement over ADV's dismal releases. It features the uncut, original Japanese version of the movie along with the English dub as well. The video quality is greatly improved and the audio track is much clearer. Finally, this was the DVD of ""Destroy All Monsters"" I had waited my entire life for.

My only complaint is that this release is below the quality I would expect from Tokyo Shock. Their ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" DVD was rife with galleries, commentaries, and other special features. ""Destroy All Monsters"" features no such extras, which is common in most Godzilla DVD releases. Still, I would have liked Tokyo Shock to imitate their previous release and include at least some extras, but this was not to be the case. Minor complaints aside, this is THE definitive DVD release of ""Destroy All Monsters"" for any fan of the King of the Monsters, and will wash away the bad taste from ADV's releases of the film. What's more, it comes at a much more reasonable price than the ADV release, meaning that there is no reason not to pick this one up. Highly recommended.

(Note: I am not condemning ADV films at all. Their releases of ""Destroy All Monsters"" were poor, but they have done some good releases of the kaiju genre on DVD as well. ADV's releases of the Gamera trilogy are excellent, featuring the Japanese and English versions of the film along with tons of awesome special features. Do not avoid ADV altogether, just their ""Destroy All Monsters"" DVDs.",1409702400,3,3373,4.802065404475043

942499,4,6304891784,"I remember being in a theater 1968-1969? watching the trailers before the Saturday Matinee was about to begin and BAM! A trailer for Destroy All Monsters came on the screen! I mean Godzilla was enough to get me to go to the movies, but here was a film that had him and all sorts of monsters, some I knew and some I didn't.

This film truly is a fan favorite of Japanese monster movies and how can it not be? It has a lot of great things going on in it. Alien Invasion, Mind control of the world's monsters and a finale battle that is crammed full of as many monsters they could find.

I had owned a previous DVD edition, but it did not include the AIP soundtrack I was familiar with when I was a kid, so I bought the Blu Ray edition and not only does it have that dub, it has a second English dub and the original Japanese voice track. All subtitles are available too. It does not however have the U.S. title cards so all text on screen is in Japanese, It's not a dealbreaker by any means, but does that mean that this is a different cut of the movie I grew up with? I'm not sure.

The film looks very good a few scratches here and there and some soft spots, but really this film has never looked this good on home video and I am very please with it. I have read reviews that this print is faded and it is not nearly as bad as those posters are stating. I watched it and I see a few scenes where the colors don't pop like we would like them too, but most of these old Japanese monster films were neglected for years so it is a treat to see this film(or any other of them)in any condition.

One other note the AIP soundtrack as a few slight flutters when it starts, but it clears up within a few minutes, The other tracks do sound better as far as fidelity, but I want to watch the film the way I remember it.",1393459200,3,1808,4.013888888888889
942500,3,6304891784,"When I was a kid, I would look at this DVD box art and say, ""wow, now that looks like an awesome movie.""  Who wouldn't want to watch this movie with art as sweet as that?
So, I finally decided to pay the forty-five dollars for this used (good condition) out-of-print film - reason being I'm working on finishing my collection, and it's a Godzilla movie I have not yet seen.  I was really excited about receiving this movie!  But...

... wow.  I was anticipating something so much cooler.  I mean, don't get me wrong, this movie is good, cheesy fun, but man was I disappointed.  I understand that this is the U.S. version of the movie, so I know the dialogue and other aspects of the film are probably hacked up in some way.
I can't get over how silly this movie can be.  There's a scene where the Japanese astronauts are flying around battling the ""fire dragon"" and their ship starts spinning in circles - no, not literally in circles, but in ""really obvious rotating the camera after filming special effects"" circles - and I swear the astronauts are laughing because their thinking about how dumb they look imagining spinning in circles screaming.
The final fight between Ghidorah and the Earth monsters is probably the highlight of the film.  Godzilla looks like he's dancing when he's waiting for Ghidorah to come, so he looks pretty silly.  Another bummer about this movie is the lack of monsters that Toho committed to in this movie.  There are literally eleven monsters mentioned throughout the film but only seven have more than four seconds of screen time.  What the heck!  Baragon made it on the cover of the DVD but is only seen twice for about a second each time.  Not cool...he's one of my favorite monsters.
Oh, and if you're looking for some sweet special features, you won't find it here.  This DVD acts just like a VHS tape.  You pop it in, and it just starts playing - minus the movie trailers at the beginning.

Destroy all Monsters isn't exactly the best Godzilla movie, but it's a decent entry in the series.  The monster scenes are actually pretty cool, and it's great watching all of the [seen] monsters beat up King Ghidorah.

It is up to an elite band of scientists and space explorers to put an end to the evil plan before it is too late! DESTROY ALL MONSTERS captures all of the most popular trends that were defined in the Showa Era, from the Space Age plot involving scheming aliens to the all-out monster melee that is promised by the title. Though it never fully delivers in either regard, it is still entertaining enough to appease the fans. DESTROY ALL MONSTERS was originally planned as the final film in the series, and is the last film to feature Godzilla's four founding fathers, with Ishiro Honda directing and Akira Ifukube composing another fine score. Despite an increased budget over the two preceding films, however, the recycled storyline and mediocre special effects fail to live up to INVASION OF THE ASTRO-MONSTER. All of that is forgotten as Toho unleashes its entire monster line-up to destroy each of Earth's capitols before facing off in a giant battle royale against King Ghidorah! The final battle is a bit of a let down since it is relatively short and many of the monsters are forced to sit on the sidelines, but Godzilla and friends gang up and take turns just beating the living hell out of Ghidorah. DESTROY ALL MONSTERS may not be the strongest film in the series, but it features all of the most popular elements that fans have come to adore.

In fact, it contains the original Japanese language, the International English dub, and the A.I.P. dub. All 3 audio tracks are clear and audible. The A.I.P. version is slightly quieter, but in my opinion (and from what I can tell, most other people's) is the superior of the 2 English dubs. It's the version most will remember watching as a child on TV and includes Hal Linden (from Barney Miller fame) and the same group who I believe dubbed many movies and cartoons (I could be wrong but i'm pretty sure it's the same people who dubbed Speed Racer and Ultraman, or maybe UltraSeven), before the Sci-Fi channel showed the International dub version on TV back in the 90's. The International version would be much better had they used England's, ""but still"" people, who dubbed many martial arts movies of the 70's and 80's (they actually dubbed the International versions of Godzilla vs. Hedorah and Godzilla vs. Gigan). Unfortunately the people who dubbed the international version of Destroy All Monsters did a terrible job, and thankfully I haven't heard them anywhere else that I know of. It also contains a commentary track with Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski which I haven't listened to as yet. Aside from the audio commentary, special features include image galleries, lobby cards, press books, poster art, trailers, radio spots, and production art, many of which are poor quality. The aspect ratio is widescreen (2.35:1). I purchased the Blu Ray version and the video quality is not perfect but is the best i've seen available so far, though I don't imagine it is much better than Tokyo Shock's standard DVD version.  From what I can tell the film is the uncut, the only scene that I know of that has never been on any DVD release (including this one) is a scene where Godzilla and Manda fight each other while both are attacking the city under control of the Alien invaders. I have only seen this scene online and I don't if there are any other scenes floating around online that never made it into the final reel. As far as i'm concerned this is the version to buy. I can only assume that it may not be available for much longer, or they are running low on supply for the time being since the price has increased drastically since back when I first purchased it.

No only that, you can easily toggle between the superior AIP soundtrack, the Japanese one and the inferior Hong-Kong-based (read:cheeseball) English soundtrack.

The transfer is decent enough  and held up well when projected on my home theater screen , it really brought the memories of the summer kiddie matinees back I almost cried! LOL. Also while the exact AIP cut of the film is not here the soundtrack is on the Second English track, The intro narration which gives the Tour of Ogaswara Island confirmed this as I remembered that voice from seeing it countless times in the theater and on TV back in the 70's. Unfortunately the soundtrack appears damaged somewhat as the voice changes pitch slightly ( probably due to stretched tape from the source obtained  ) but only for that intro part. THe AIP dubbing and dialog is so much better than that ""International"" version which had some really stupid lines like ""Hey you let the monsters get out while the boss was away!""  The AIP soundtrack treated the film with a lot more respect and really superior in every way. I didn't listen to the soundtrack with the two ""Godzilla scholars"" yet. I should as I am just as qualified to call myself a Godzilla scholar too! Anyway, This disk was not disappointing at all and played on my player with no issues at all. I highly recommend it.

This is the only DVD (out of hundreds)_ that I own that does have a DVD menu but doesn't even have scenes. One of the key aspects of having DVDs over VHS' in my opinion is being able to skip scenes in their entirety without having to do the constant fast forwarding and rewinding of yesteryear. The picture is not great but it certainly isn't bad. The sound is actually quite good. The only bonus is the soundtrack CD that comes with the DVD. It is an actual CD that can be played in CD players and not a bunch of songs for you to listen to off of a DVD (I've seen it in other DVDs). This DVD is selling for more money than most DVDs but there is no reason to pay the outrageous price for the other releases of this movie. Additionally, there is no original Japanese audio track for this DVD. In all, the monster roster is amazing, (even throwing in Varan and Manda)and this release is cheaper than the other DVD releases; its just sad that they didn't do a better job considering the 50th anniversary title.",1354579200,3,1164,4.177777777777778

****update**** I just received a copy of the new Destroy all Monsters dvd, I got from walmart.com. it does not have the AIP DUB. its the international English 2.0, Japanese 5.1, and Japanese 2.0. there are no special features on this release. the menu screen looks different from my blu ray version. it is in widescreen though.",1354320000,3,1575,4.130293159609121
942621,4,6304891784,"Destroy All Monsters gets what appears to be the ultimate american release in Blu Ray (AIP dub and Japanese original audio included) by Media Blasters. However it's far from being ideal, and just to be fair, I don't think Media Blasters are to blame.

VIDEO 7/10
The video is unimpressive. Not to say it's upscaled, I truly think it comes from Toho's HD telecine. However it's a simple TELECINE from the 35mm restored version. The image is soft and bland, it seems to come from the same source used for the Japanese DVD (again an HD Telecine, downscaled for the DVD and in its full ""glory"" for the BD). However in this day and age we are used to 4k scan and full digital restoration and color correction (a-la Criterion), and thus the minimal effort in restoring this movie for HDTV by Toho turns this release a bit in dissappointment. It's interesting to see that since the broadcast of the classical Godzillas in HDTV in Japan and after the rage and disappointment by their loyal Japanese fans (especially when we compare them to the awesome job done by Kadokawa on their Gamera library) Toho has stopped releasing Godzilla on BD in Japan. If they are seriously remastering their HD sources for their Godzilla Japanese HD library, I hope they consider halting the international sales until better PQ materials are finished.

AUDIO 7/10
It comes with the original AIP dub in mono, due to the original mix being completely lost, Media Blasters has included what seems to me a VHS rip. Still, it's better than nothing. Also it includes in DTS-HD Stereo the international Toho dub (dubbed in Hong Kong), the original Japanese Stereo mix in DTS-HD and the 5.1 Japanese remix in Dolby Digital made for the Japanese DVD (this audio feature is not included in the BD case artwork, but it's there and it's the best audio option in my opinion). The only shame here is not having a DTS-HD 5.1 Surround remix like we had in the Gamera BDs, but then again that's Toho's way of dealing with Godzilla in HD. Media Blaster has gone the extra mile by providing the AIP dub, even if it sounds ""craptacular"".

EXTRAS 8/10
We don't have the audio commentary found in Toho's Japanese release (I guess that the pricetag demanded by Toho would have been ridiculous), but we have a new commentary track by the same people that did commentary tracks in Classic Media's Classic Godzilla DVDs so it's nice to have this addition to their fantastic previous job. It also includes an insane amount of posters and stills, from various sources: from shooting and behind the scenes stills to photos taking at rolling road shows. It's pretty much a mess and some of the stills are repeated 2, 3 or 4 times. They are not properly labeled either and can be a bit confusing (I think this is the reason why Toho demanded to see and approve their future release for Godzilla VS Megalon by MB, they don't want so many stills, and they want them properly labeled and placed). Finally we have promos and 8mm edits of the film. Again Media Blasters has done a good job (even if the stills were a bit messy), the only thing missing is the original Japanese commentary.

OVERALL 7/10
It's nice to have an English subtitled version of Destroy All Monsters at least. This is my favourite Golden Age Godzilla film and Media Blasters has done their job importing the movie. However Toho has not been up to the standards when treating their classic cataloge for international sales (just see Classic Media's original Godzilla BD) and it seems that their BD releases in Japan have been lacking too. Hopefully they are remastering and scannning all their Godzilla library and in a couple of years we'll be seeing Godzilla international releases with more quality than this. Or maybe Criterion's GOJIRA sells like pancakes and they think on remastering the whole classic series... ... ... NOT!

942704,3,6304891784,"Well, this is definitely better than any old DVD release... But it is a shame that we probably won't get much better than this.

What I mean is this - the company who put this out, for a variety of reasons, isn't likely to put out more...or any more Toho films, and Toho is not in a rush to properly see that North America/International releases happen. They never really have.

So besides the 1954 film, which got two very good releases lately, it is pretty sparse for the rest of the series. As I understand it, there's a complicated web of rights and licensing agreements that date back years, and the corresponding elements you need for HD releases may or may not exist or be easily to find. Since these are also old films, elements tend to be missing or in disrepair. These might include, in theory, the American scenes added to the early films and other differences between International and American releases. A perfect Blu-Ray release of the series would have as many versions of each film possible.

I might be wrong, and Toho might have everything ready to go on a hard drive, but I doubt it. Meaning, the US scenes in King Kong and the US title cards and intros. The English language tracks weren't the only things added to some releases. With DAM, we have a Japenese print with English Language audio as options. Seeing Destroy All Monsters in text rather than the kanji would have been preferable.

So back on topic, the transfer is...okay. Yes, the film is from 1969, yes it was from Toho and from the sci-fi unit, and yes there was probably an intentional soft-focus and definitely layering of smoke to increase depth of field, but it's not as good as I think it could be. This is not a title that got an exhaustive restoration and cleanup job.  No one claimed that it did, and it still is better than the old DVD release or VHS bootleg you may have taped from TV. Unfortunately, I think theres still more to get out of this TohoScope print. But I don't know if or when well get to see it.

The release company tried on this release- there's some neat stills and photographs included (which seemed to upset Toho), and they are put in sideshows set to the films great soundtrack. But oddly...you'll see the same few photos over and over and then one or two new ones, and them some more repeats and some new ones. I almost stopped it once because I thought it was a loop...it wasn't, there's just duplicates for no reason.  There's some 8mm footage included but I'm not sure what for. There's some storyboards and production drawings, but most of them are positioned and zoomed out to fit a legal pad size paper on the screen that you can't resolve the artwork. A few drawings are given proper size on the screen, but I'm not sure why they took the time to scan these documents only to shrink most of them down to fit a page on a 16x9 screen. Each panel could have been given one screen, or half a page.

The audio for one of the tracks is garbled at the start, with no disclaimer or explanation..... ""almost lost but found!"" hype could have been great for them to promote, but instead the gravitas of the narrator breaks for some precious  moments of the introduction.

The audio commentary was fair, but not great. There were limitations (not done in the same room, in real time), and this was not something you can practice early and often. The commentary is great when they speak into motivations and analysis, the commentary is not so great when it strays into cast and crew biography and filmography. Basically, you cannot simply write biographical and career outlines and read them and expect it to be captivating, especially with unfamiliar names and unfamiliar movies. The prose goes on for twice as long as it should and it really comes off stiff. But other times the commentary is captivating and pithy. It's just a matter of something's being better as text and other things better as spoken word. It's best when they try and tap into the heart and fun of the movie and try to paint a picture of this,film really being an ending for the golden age at Toho, and explaining some insights about the directors and artists who worked on the film (knowing that Honda had an optimistic viewpoint of the future and that Eiji Tsuburaya was someone who was not a delegator, but was very hands on until he stepped out, was fascinating... hearing detailed filmography and biography read was not).

The commentary does get into reviewing the movie for the surprisingly weak motivation of the villains, and the shallow chacericerizatiions - and reckons that despite that, it was built around the monster eyecandy and that they appreciated it as such as they were children (like so many block busters now) and was well received. New audiences are less impressed they observe. But what was Japanese reaction to the movie? Surely they have access to reviews at the time through their research and collecting.  It would also have been interesting hearing about why there was shallowness, especially after Monster Zeros depth and the depth still possible in the series with Terror Of Mechagodzilla, or hearing them speculate. This would have been enjoyable, more so than filmography and biographical abstracts. I can look those up, I can't look up expert Godzilla opinion and first hand interviews (which they do include sometimes).

This has all the trappings of what a monster bluray should look and feel like, but it could have been much better, and I doubt Toho will do much better with whoever else they decide to release through.",1341878400,9,5541,4.641836734693878

942707,3,6304891784,"I must say, for the first time in my online shopping life, I am very disappointed in Amazon.com. I have never before ordered something from the website itself, and had a negative experience. Typically, if they have something in stock, it correctly says so on the product's page, or if not, it clearly says ""not available"". This was not the case with Destroy All Monsters. I ordered this, along with another movie, and while I eventually received the other DVD, DAM never even shipped. I chatted with Amazon ""help"" employees twice, as well as e-mail correspondence, and was told the item was temporarily unavailable, even though the product page itself failed to say so for quite some time. It eventually did, even though my order statement claimed that I still had an ""expected shipping date"", which changed twice. Finally, after nearly a month and a half of waiting, I cancelled the order, because the product page now says that the DVD (nor Blu-Ray) are even available from Amazon.com anymore. So either the DVD itself is already out of print (which I would find hard to believe), or Amazon themselves have somehow found it too hard to simply order some more copies, so that they might fill out the order I made back in February.

All in all, I am a huge Godzilla fan, and while I already own the earlier DVD release of this movie, I wanted this improved release badly. I am very disappointed, again for the first time ever, with Amazon and their total lack of service in this instance. I sincerely hope this never happens again, but it's still very disheartening, to someone who really wanted to add what might be a great DVD to his collection. Sure, I can always order it from another seller, but at a higher price, and it still doesn't change the fact that I should have received the item I purchased, when it said it was available.

The restoration on the film is amazingly clear and the sound is crisp. Three versions are available, the AIP dub (the superior dub), the international dub, and the original japanese audio. Plus a load of special features! This is an almost perfect release. I say that because it is missing the one special feature I really really wanted to see... the deleted scene where Godzilla fights Manda! To me this was the holy grail of Godzilla deleted sequences. You can watch it on Youtube. For the life of me I cannot fathom why Media Blasters didn't include this hidden gem.

In summary, this is one of the most complete Godzilla dvd/blu-ray releases ever done albiet missing one crucial (crucial for me at least) piece. It is still worthy of 5 stars!

I haven't watched it with the Japanese or international audio (I have no interest in the international version; it's pretty annoying), so I can't comment on those, but the AIP audio sounds pretty good. Of course, there is the issue of the distorted sound early on, but it lasts for only a small amount of time, and while it is distracting for a short time, it is hardly worth complaining about, at least not as much as some I've seen. I'm sure there was a better source out there somewhere, but these people worked with only what they were allowed to work with (minus the issue with the photos), so it's not like they didn't put any effort into it at all. I haven't experienced the issue with the disc freezing at 34 minutes, but I bought the disc elsewhere, so maybe that is a factor. The extras are nice. The commentary by Ed and Steve is again informative and interesting, and it also has trailers, photos, and even radio spots!

As for the movie itself, most long-time fans already have an opinion, but for those who haven't seen it, you need to. It is definitely not my favorite, but it is a must-watch, if nothing more than the monster action. I'm not going to compare it to any of the mother movies, but again I say it's worth a watch.

942713,4,6304891784,"DESTROY ALL MONSTERS is probably my second favorite Godzilla movie after the original (though it's certainly neck-and-neck with 1964's MOTHRA VS. GODZILLA, a.k.a. GODZILLA VS. THE THING). It's the last entry in the Showa era Godzilla films made in the inimitable style of Ishiro Honda's most classic daikaiju outings, and is, in fact, Honda's penultimate directorial job of the Godzilla series. The film is literally a gathering of most of Toho's monsters, and they are given plenty of quality screen time. Similarly, the human cast includes many familiar, noteworthy faces, with Akira Kubo, Yoshio Tsuchiya, and Jun Tazaki playing prominent, memorable roles. Akira Ifukube's musical score remains one of his all-time best, reprising several well-known themes, from his traditional Godzilla theme to motifs used for Rodan and King Ghidorah, as well as a distinctive military march, all beautifully arranged and orchestrated.

DESTROY ALL MONSTERS utilizes the now timeworn premise of space aliens--specifically, the Kilaaks, who come from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter--saying politely to Earth's leaders, ""Please hand over your planet, or these monsters will bust your ass."" The storyline is similar to MONSTER ZERO, made a couple of years previously, but in most respects, DESTROY ALL MONSTERS goes about it on a grander scale, with daikaiju showing up all over the world to wreak havoc. However, in MONSTER ZERO, the Xians have some motivation for conquering the earth: the acquisition of natural resources (water, in this case), which is scarce on their world. (In fact, it's rather ironic that the villains in that movie in some ways reflect Japan's expansionist philosophy prior to World War II.) In DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, there's no insinuation of motive; only that, for the Kilaaks, a little conquest makes for an enjoyable day's work.

The Kilaaks themselves are interesting enough; in their terrestrial form, they appear as beautiful, silver-clad women--or at least holographic projections of beautiful, silver-clad women. In their natural state, they are living minerals, which resemble snails made of glittery stone, and they can only survive in an environment of extreme heat--which begs the question, how do enslaved humans share their living space without being burned to death? Perhaps the bodies of the human slaves we view are actually Kilaaks who have merely taken their forms, but this little point is never addressed in the script. Of course, in a movie such as this, one doesn't expect scientific plausibility, although it's certainly nice when events adhere to at least a modicum of internal logic.

Ah well, in DESTROY ALL MONSTERS, it's the monsters themselves we paid to see, and in this regard, the movie doesn't disappoint. This is the movie that introduces us to Monster Island, a.k.a. Monsterland on Ogasawara Island, where most of Toho's daikaiju have been collected and confined, for security purposes as well as for scientific investigation. (We'll have to take it on faith that, in actuality, the monsters have been there for a while because, though the movie is set in 1999, films that were made after DESTROY ALL MONSTERS but ostensibly occur at an earlier date, such as GODZILLA VS. GIGAN and GODZILLA VS. MEGALON, also feature Monster Island.) Unlike the Xians in MONSTER ZERO, who showed some restraint and didn't unleash the monsters until we ungrateful Earthlings refused their kind offer of enslavement, the Kilaaks start off on the right foot and send the monsters to the four corners of the earth to do some whooping on miniature cities. Godzilla invades New York! Manda slithers through London! Rodan swats down Moscow! Baragon burrows under Paris!

But wait...that's not actually Baragon. Why...it's Gorosaurus, from KING KONG ESCAPES. This little gaffe is in the original Japanese version as well as the English, and this is because, originally, Baragon was scheduled to destroy Paris, and the dialogue stating this had already been recorded. However, when the scene was filmed, Toho found the Baragon suit beyond repair--largely from multiple uses (in disguise, of course) in the ULTRAMAN TV series. So Gorosaurus was hastily substituted, but that's even Baragon's roar you hear when the Arc de Triomphe crumbles. In general, the monster suits are very good, although King Ghidorah appears a bit more scraggly than he did in MONSTER ZERO. The Godzilla suit is well-proportioned and has a ferocious demeanor--a monstrous improvement over his distinctly frog-like appearance in his previous film, SON OF GODZILLA.

In late 2011, Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock finally gave this landmark film the respectable release it deserves. For years, the bare-bones ADV edition, featuring only the disastrous Hong Kong English dub, was all that was available domestically. The Tokyo Shock DVD offers the choice of the original Japanese language version, the International (Hong Kong) dub, and the AIP-Titan Studios dub, which is the one most fans on this side of the Pacific will remember from its original U.S. release. Sadly, the AIP soundtrack is not well mastered, with lots of background noise, erratic volume shifts, and other problems that tend to be grating. There are bootlegs of the ADV DVD that feature a high-quality version of the Titan dub, and you'd think Tokyo Shock could have at least done as well. The commentary by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski, at least, is entertaining and spot-on. Unfortunately, at least the initial release of the DVD suffers from a bad layer change at about 34 minutes into the film; my original disc completely locked up here and would not allow me to watch further. I exchanged the disc, and while there's a momentary pause at the same spot, at least the disc plays on.

942766,4,6304891784,"I grew up in the late 60s/early 70s watching all the original kaiju movies (well, as original as an American International release could be) and ""Destroy All Monsters"" was second only to ""Voyage Into Space"" on my list of favorites. It wasn't just one monster (say, Godzilla) versus a couple of space monsters; it was a whole bunch of Earth monsters all together fighting a space monster *and* destroying Tokyo. Plus DAM had the best main title music.

I have owned the ADV Films release for several years and only recently started watching it again, as my four-year-old son has discovered the magic of men in rubber suits stomping on miniature cities. DAM has rapidly become his favorite (and the main title is his favorite as well) and he can name more of the monsters than I ever could. The DVD went missing so I ordered the new Tokyo Shock re-release. In the meantime we found the first DVD and I was considering sending the new one back, but when I put it on my HDTV, I came to my senses.

The Tokyo Shock release is far superior. Just seeing the title credits in the original Japanese was worth the price of the disc. Now not only can I watch the movie my preferred way (in the original language with English subs), but the picture is anamorphic so the image isn't squeezed down beyond correction like the ADV version. The print isn't pristine but it's in great condition for its age. (The only downside is that now I can see all the wires that I never saw on a tiny tube TV.)

I've been impressed with most of ADV's releases in the past (their seemingly apathetic DVD release of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunhed/dp/B00062J0CQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunhed</a>"" is a notable exception), but Tokyo Shock has left them in the dust on this one.

However, there is actually only 1 video track on this DVD (there isn't a separate U.S. or International version), so all of the audio options (including the Int'l. and AIP dubs) sync up with the Japanese version of the film.

As for the extra features, there is a generous amount found here, which includes an English audio commentary track, a number of trailers (although the French trailer is in very poor condition) and some clips from the original Super 8 film as well (in very poor condition). There are also a few additional bonus featurettes, plus a hidden ""easter egg""...so go find it!

It is far superior to Toho's international dub.  I was excited to find out that this DVD would offer the option of listening to it.  Sadly, it suffers from serious distortion for the first few minutes.  It almost sounds like you're watching it on a 16mm film projector that's misfeeding.

942847,5,6304891784,"First off, this review is not about the movie itself, but only discusses the Blu-ray transfer; for info on the movie proper, please see IMDb or other reviews here on Amazon. There have already been a number of reviews and comments posted here and on various blogs complaining about the quality of the new Tokyo Shock/Media Blasters Blu-ray release of Destroy All Monsters. Having received my copy a few days ago and directly compared it to the previous ADV DVD release, I thought I'd put my two cents in.

The only real flaw with the transfer is that the black level isn't as deep as it should be, giving the picture overall a somewhat watery, washed-out appearance. That said, virtually every other aspect of the transfer (color palette/fidelity, sharpness/detail, grain structure, contrast, framing) is a big improvement over the ADV DVD, which exhibits a strong blue cast, soft, muddy detail (especially in the darker scenes), poor color fidelity, excessive contrast, print debris and blemishing, and even some annoying ghosting. (Some have even speculated that the Blu-ray is merely an upconvert of an SD DVD transfer, which I don't need any more evidence than that provided by my eyeballs to flatly refute. Detail is much too crisp to be an upconvert; textures of skin, hair, rocks, walls, etc., are much finer than DVD can resolve. And you can't create detail that isn't present in the source by upconverting.)

While I agree that the transfer is somewhat less than optimal, there is a very quick and easy fix for those who own a digital television: simply tweak the picture settings. I set up my 60"" flatscreen's ""Standard"" picture mode using a few reference-quality Blu-rays and high-quality cable channels to display these sources optimally. However, I have another picture mode (in my case ""User"") that I specifically customized for discs that exhibit the slightly watery, washed-out appearance of the DAM Blu-ray, with lowered brightness and heightened contrast to deepen the blacks while controlling the highlights, and simultaneously enriching the color as well.

So, here's my fix: pick  a picture mode other than the one you normally use and (1) drop the brightness and/or backlight and increase the contrast until you have a nice rich black in the darkest areas without blowing out the highlights, (2) jack the color saturation up a bit, and (3) move the tint a few points toward the red end. With these tweaks applied, which took me all of 30 seconds, the picture looks 500% better--very nice, if not spectacular--and eminently worthy of the Blu-ray format. Would it have been better if Media Blasters had made these adjustments on their end so I don't have to? Yes. Is it that big a deal that I should be getting my undies in a bunch over it? No. Once you have one of your picture modes set up this way, you can use it correct other DVDs with similar issues (I own probably a dozen other titles with a similar look.)

I don't know anything about the behind-the-scenes of what went down between Toho and Media Blasters, and, frankly, I don't care. I'm glad to have this on Blu with a much improved transfer that makes the ADV release look pretty much like garbage in comparison, not to mention the host of extras provided. The Blu-ray reveals more picture information on the left and right sides that is cut off on the ADV DVD, the print source is immaculate, the grain is for the most part extremely tight and virtually unnoticeable, the color palette and balance are much improved, with far more natural fleshtones, and sharpness and detail are dramatically enhanced. Yes, the included AIP audio dub contains a few minor glitches, particularly during the first few minutes, but nothing that seriously impacted my enjoyment of the movie or makes me regret purchasing this release. And, as I outlined above, the black-level issue is easily solvable in far less time than it takes to write a review or post a comment on a blog.",1322265600,4,3943,4.852897473997028

No luck here. As a long time film collector, I immediately noticed the audio problem. The film was too loose on the sound drum, so it slipped and wavered. This caused that horrible and amazingly distracting problem. WOW! how UN-professional can a company get?

942851,4,6304891784,"I previously owned the 2000 ADV DVD of ""Destroy All Monsters,"" which I understand is essentially the same as or very similar to the 50th anniversary release. There is no contest between this release and the ADV disc. The ADV disc was atrociously bad, resembling a rip from an SD TV with a home DVD-recorder.

DAM on Blu-Ray is a world of improvement. Aside from the multiple audio tracks, which greatly enhance the film, the Blu-Ray transfer is at times stunning. There is absolutely no comparison between this disc and any previous transfer of DAM that I've seen. Although there are imperfections, this is a welcome release. This transfer is, in some ways, comparable to the Blu-Ray Gojira release from Classic Media (the only other Godzilla Blu currently available with English subtitles or audio), which was generally sharper and more notably high definition, but which was also uneven.

No information was provided on how the remastering was performed, but I'm going to take a guess that multiple prints were used with the best of an imperfect bunch selected for any given scene. You can see the quality vary at times, even within a scene. One moment, the picture will be crisp and bright, then the color and light will fade somewhat. Impressively, I didn't spot a scratch or speck of dust throughout the film.

Additionally, it's obvious at times that the problem lies with the source and that even a pristine negative would likely still have issues. For instance, the Rodin flying scenes are almost all grainy, either due to how they were filmed or possibly because of the use of lower quality stock footage in the original cut.

Unfortunately, the best quality comes with well-lit interior scenes of scientists standing around. The monsters are often (but not always) less crisp and less saturated with color. Occasionally, however, they pop and the contrast between the good and not-so-good scenes is striking. If the whole movie was that sharp, I'd give it an unreserved five stars. As it is, I'm grateful for the improvement and not much inclined to nitpick. Put your TV on the default ""Vivid"" setting for the best results.

For those who know Godzilla, you basically know what you're getting as far as the movie itself, one of the better Showa films and featuring the widest array of monsters from that era (even Varan the Unbelievable has a brief cameo). The human part of the story is subpar for the era, the monster part is a bit above par. Personally, DAM is not one of my top five from the Showa era, but it's an enjoyable romp nevertheless.

When I was inquiring about Godzilla movies on Blu-Ray last year, the guy at my local store pointed out that Blu might not be kind to the effects. Now that I've seen it, I would say it alternates between enhancing the effects and detracting. On the one hand, you can see the incredible artisanal detail that went into many of the miniatures. On the other hand, you can sometimes become acutely aware that a building is cardboard or a model is plastic. Godzilla fans are accustomed to this kind of thing, so it's not a big problem if your expectations are realistic.

Audio options include two different English dubs and the original Japanese. The 5.1 audio mix on the Japanese version was nothing special and didn't come off much differently .

Overall, I'm thrilled with the upgrade, even with the relatively minor complaints. It's not as sharp as a typical Blu-Ray release but it's miles ahead of what we had before, and if you're familiar with the movie you'll appreciate the drastic improvement. The disc whetted my appetite for more high-definition Godzilla releases, which have already begun to be produced in Japan, and I hope this is the first of many releases here. I understand Godzilla v. Megalon is up next, which certainly isn't the one I would have started with, but any and all are welcome.",1321574400,2,3863,4.7811094452773615

Projector.
Noise.

The rest of the content is fine, so if you prefer Japanese audio with subtitles or you can stomach the ""International Dub,"" this will more than suffice. The video is quite good, and is the unaltered Japanese version with forced (but not hard-coded) subtitles at key moments. (The AIP opening title is an Easter Egg, but appears to be a washed-out, damaged filmstrip with an uncorrected aspect ratio...quite probably the same source as the AIP audio.)

The extras and commentary are very nice, but the assorted artwork (posters, designs, production stills, storyboards) are frequently presented deep inside the frame, smaller than necessary, when we should've gotten a few closeups.

It deserves a top notch blu-ray release but unfortunately, this release is not it. I commend Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock for releasing this legendary film on blu-ray. But this blu-ray is a serious mixed bag. There are some washed out colors that other reviewers have commented on, some softness and even some fuzziness throughout the transfer. BUT, there are some scenes that actually look quite nice i.e. the shoot-out at the beach looks really good. There are mixed bag close-up shots of humans; some look soft and some look great. Some of the other shots like 3 shots and 4 shots look really nice as well. But where it counts is the scenes with the monsters in them which unfortunately is a letdown. There are a few close-ups of the monsters that stand out but for the most part a majority of the monster scenes are washed out and soft. But for some reason, the shots of Kumonga looks really nice. Amazon has this blu-ray ""temporarily out of stock"" seemingly forever so I had to order it elsewhere last week. I do plan on ordering the dvd version in the near future simply because of the rarity of this release. Media Blasters as a whole has released some shabby blu-rays like ""Versus"", ""Ichi The Killer"" and ""The Machine Girl"". Their blu-ray releases of ""Death Trance"" and ""Death Kappa"" were better with their blu-ray release of the South Korean masterpiece ""Hansel & Gretel"" being their crowned jewel with a stunning transfer. Overall, I am happy with the ""Destroy All Monsters"" blu-ray release but not thrilled with it. But when paying more than $20 for a blu-ray, one would expect nicer quality. I don't care what film stock they had access to. Now, everyone is wondering how Media Blasters' blu-ray version of ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" will turn out. At least the ""Destroy All Monsters"" blu-ray is better than Classic Media's horrible ""Gojira"" blu-ray. Can't wait for Criterion's release of Godzilla in January; which should be something to behold; love what they did with the ""Hausu"" and ""In The Realm Of The Senses"" blu-rays. Is this blu-ray worth purchasing? I would say yes. Even if just for the sake of having an original Japanese language version of this film and having a nicer but flawed transfer. Now if Media Blasters can get the rights to ""The Return Of Godzilla"" and ""Godzilla vs. Biollante"". That would be a dream come true. I imported the Japanese blu-rays (that do have English subtitles) of ""Long And Dark-Haired Monster Geharha"" and ""Ultra Galaxy Mega Monster Battle: The Movie"" because who knows if and when these films will ever come out in the United States.",1321142400,4,2733,4.804670912951168
942855,2,6304891784,"Although we are treated to the much-loved AIP English dub from the 1960's, the poor quality control of the transfer makes it almost pointless. The first five minutes alone, my personal favorite section of the movie which introduced me to the pantheon of Toho's monsters as a kid, stutters and cuts out as if the projector wasn't threaded correctly. This is a simple error that should never have made it to store shelves. This is definitely not a digital error isolated to my copy as other buyers have posted this same issue on Media Blasters' Facebook page. Media Blasters' explanation is that, although they are aware of the problem, they couldn't find a better copy. This is poor excuse that says nothing more than they simply didn't care to look for a better one or to fix a mistake during the transfer. There are a number of private collections that would allow them a bevy of both digital and 35mm sources that would have easily fixed any trouble spots.

The commentary, although incredibly informative, is barely audible. The volume must be raised considerably to hear it, thus making the menu music ear-blastingly loud by comparison.

Well the Blu-ray Case was the sturdier kind with the Embossed Logo on top that is not colored silver or white and left uncolored. They screwed up the beginning again by inserting the End Credits Sequence into the Starting where XY-3 takes off. The AIP English Dub sounded really Degraded with Static and Noise Echo Interruptions. I only listened to the beginning before I switched to the Japanese 5.1 Audio. So I'm not sure if this Major Problem persists throughout the rest of the Movie. When the XY-3 has the Countdown before it launches, I hear 6 then static and it resumes at 2 then 1 then launch. I even switched to a portable Blu-ray Player to make sure it wasn't my TV Speakers. Same result. For the Record. There are 5 Audio Options. English 2.0 ( The Anniversary Dub or the AIP Dub),Japanese 2.0 or 5.1 , Commentary from Steve Ryfle & Ed Godziszewski ( I never watch with Commentary so I can't say whether they did a good job). You can access through your Remote's Audio Button or the On Screen Menu & Special Features ( For Commentary). The Picture Resolution was 1080p but I compared it to my two Japanese Edition Laserdiscs of Destroy All Monsters ( One a Toho Champion Matsuri Special Edition from the Death Battle Chronicles Set). The Picture Quality was about the same with the Blu-ray version slightly more cleaned up in certain scenes but the same immaculate quality in other scenes. Media Blasters could ( should )have included the AIP US Movie Option like they did with the Rodan /War of the Gargantuas Double Feature Set. Where they had the Japanese Edition & The US Edition instead of having the Same Japanese Version with 5 Different Audio Options. MB could have also included Deleted Scenes like when Godzilla and Manda are attacking Tokyo and the Good Guys jam the signal then they fight each other. The Special Features had stuff that I have seen before from the Japanese Laserdiscs and others that I have not. All in All it was Okay but could have been much better. Oh and the Subtitles reflect today's Slang like saying "" This Sucks to run away and not fight"" as well as others that had me roll my eyes.

 During that period we got 15 godzilla films and this movie is one of the best featuring many monsters destroying the earth. In fact only final wars from 2006 has so many monsters in a godzilla film but that movie is inferior to the 1968 movie we are talking about. Even MANDA which is a very rare monster (Godzilla's subordinate) has a few scenes in this 1968 movie. Manda's only solo movie is called atragon and except for that flick u can only see it in this 1968 movie.

 HERE ARE THE THREE BEST GODZILLA A GRADE FROM THAT PERIOD 1954 - 1975

 1) GODZILLA VS THE MONSTER ZERO aka INVASION OF THE ASTRO MONSTER (1965)
 2) DESTROY ALL MONSTERS (1968)
 3) TERROR OF MECHAGODZILLA (1975)

 OTHER GREAT GODZILLA FILMS:

 1) THE THREE HEADED MONSTER (1964)
 2) GODZILLA VS THE SEA MONSTER aka EBIRAH HORROR OF THE DEEP (1966)
 3) GODZILLA VS GIGAN (1972)
 4) GODZILLA 1985 aka THE RETURN OF GODZILLA
 5) GODZILLA VS KING GHIDORAH (1991)
 6) GODZILLA VS MECHAGODZILLA II (1993)
 7) GODZILLA VS SPACE GODZILLA (1994)
 8) GODZILLA VS DESTOROYAH (1996)

Anyway, always loved this as a kid.  I kept seeing one version that cut the intros of the monsters and cut right to the rocket crew encountering the Kilaaks on Monster Island.  Then my local station showed a different version that had the beginning but cut the big 4 monster destruction of Tokyo.  Would be nice to have a complete version with both the English & Japanese dubs.

942930,5,6304891784,"First there was the ADV release. The one everyone hated. No menu, no scene select, no chapter stops, no bonus, no anything other than the movie itself. Then they tried it again. This time adding the soundtrack CD. But still the same dvd. NOW we finally have a somewhat less than stellar what we've been clamouring for AIP version. Yes you can hear what sounds like projector flutter at the beginning. And the count down of the SY3 is interrupted. 10 9 8 7- - - - 2 1 1. After that it's pretty reasonable. The AIP suffers from low volume. The international version unfortunately sounds much fuller. I do get a big kick when Godzilla and Angiurus are attacking the drone tanks and the tank commander snarls ""Why that..."" in that version. The commentary by Steve Ryfle and Ed Godwhatsthespellingofhisname is informative but comes across as boring as it sounds lifeless and uninspirering. Every word sounds like it's read from a clipboard or a prompter. It seems like they're not actually watching the movie, but only enough writing lined up to match a few scenes along the way. They talked about what they called ""The money shot"" as Ghidrah approaches the battleground from his point of view and landing, which is cool, no disagreements here. But they fail to mention the real money shot of Gorasaurus and his kangaroo kick that knocks ghidrah flat on his face. Back to the dvd Although this disc offers 5 audio choices it only has one video choice. Have you noticed no matter which audio you select the credits are in Japanese only. Now if you want a much better AIP dvd of this movie you have to go to Monster Island Toys. I strongly recommend you get it fast. It went from 19.99 to 24.99 and their shipping is pricey. I have it. It has a fuller sound. No projector flutter. And no interuppted audio. There are no subtitles however, but the credits are in English.

Why Toho Studios decided to take Godzilla from being a fierce monster and make him into a kid friendly one in the mid sixties and all of the seventies I don't know. At least they made him mean again starting with Godzilla 1985. Godzilla 1985 is one movie I would like to see come out on DVD.

As far as new Destroy All Monsters DVD goes, I already have this movie on DVD that was put out by ADV Films. I like the cover on the AVD Films DVD case much better. Still, at this price I will most likely buy the new DVD just to see what the differences are.

I actually saw Destroy All Monsters when it came out at a movie theater as a kid. It was a great experience for my brother and me.

The sound quality on the former & latter are just fine.  The sound quality on the AIP version has 1 glitch. There was a fluttering sound at the beginning of the movie, with some grainy sound transfer.  At times, it made me feel as if I were viewing the movie on an old film projector.  I don't know.  The problem may be with the source material, or the DVD production process.  In either case, I was very happy to hear the soundtrack that I fondly remember from my childhood.  The video quality for the DVD was actually excellent. No grain or fading of the images.  What was your feeling about the DVD? Did it meet your expectations?  I'd like to know.

I am hopeful but still waiting for the final word.  On Scifi Japan, they said it contains 2 english dubs, but doesn't identify one as the A.I.P. version which is exactly what all the Godzilla fans clearly want.

943020,4,6304891784,"Destroy All Monsters is probably my second favorite Godzilla movie after the original (though it's certainly neck-and-neck with 1964's Mothra vs. Godzilla). It's the last entry in the Showa era Godzilla films made in the inimitable style of Ishiro Honda's most classic daikaiju outings, and is, in fact, Honda's penultimate directorial job of the Godzilla series. The film is literally a gathering of most of Toho's monsters, and they are given plenty of quality screen time. Similarly, the human cast includes many familiar, noteworthy faces, with Akira Kubo, Yoshio Tsuchiya, and Jun Tazaki playing prominent, memorable roles. Akira Ifukube's musical score remains one of his all-time best, reprising several well-known themes, from his traditional Godzilla theme to motifs used for Rodan and King Ghidorah, as well as a distinctive military march, all beautifully arranged and orchestrated.

Destroy All Monsters utilizes the now timeworn premise of space aliens--specifically, the Kilaaks, who come from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter--saying politely to Earth's leaders, ""Please hand over your planet, or these monsters will bust your ass."" The storyline is similar to Monster Zero, made a couple of years previously, but in most respects, Destroy All Monsters goes about it on a grander scale, with daikaiju showing up all over the world to wreak havoc. However, in Monster Zero, the Xians have some motivation for conquering the earth: the acquisition of natural resources (water, in this case), which is scarce on their world. (In fact, it's rather ironic that the villains in that movie in some ways reflect Japan's expansionist philosophy prior to World War II.) In Destroy All Monsters, there's no insinuation of motive; only that, for the Kilaaks, a little conquest makes for an enjoyable day's work.

The Kilaaks themselves are interesting enough; in their terrestrial form, they appear as beautiful, silver-clad women--or at least holographic projections of beautiful, silver-clad women. In their natural state, they are living minerals, which resemble snails made of glittery stone, and they can only survive in an environment of extreme heat--which begs the question, how do enslaved humans share their living space without being burned to death? Perhaps the bodies of the human slaves we view are actually Kilaaks who have merely taken their forms, but this little point is never addressed in the script. Of course, in a movie such as this, one doesn't expect scientific plausibility, although it's certainly nice when events adhere to at least a modicum of internal logic.

Ah well, in Destroy All Monsters, it's the monsters themselves we paid to see, and in this regard, the movie doesn't disappoint. This is the movie that introduces us to Monster Island, a.k.a. Monsterland on Ogasawara Island, where most of Toho's daikaiju have been collected and confined, for security purposes as well as for scientific investigation. (We'll have to take it on faith that, in actuality, the monsters have been there for a while because, though the movie is set in 1999, films that were made after Destroy All Monsters but ostensibly occur at an earlier date, such as Godzilla vs. Gigan and Godzilla vs. Megalon, also feature Monster Island.) Unlike the Xians in Monster Zero, who showed some restraint and didn't unleash the monsters until we ungrateful Earthlings refused their kind offer of enslavement, the Kilaaks start off on the right foot and send the monsters to the four corners of the earth to do some whooping on miniature cities. Godzilla invades New York! Manda slithers through London! Rodan swats down Moscow! Baragon burrows under Paris!

But wait...that's not actually Baragon. Why...it's Gorosaurus, from King Kong Escapes. This little gaffe is in the original Japanese version as well as the English, and this is because, originally, Baragon was scheduled to destroy Paris, and the dialogue stating this had already been recorded. However, when the scene was filmed, Toho found the Baragon suit beyond repair--largely from multiple uses (in disguise, of course) in the Ultraman TV series. So Gorosaurus was hastily substituted, but that's even Baragon's roar you hear when the Arc de Triomphe crumbles. In general, the monster suits are very good, although King Ghidorah appears a bit more scraggly than he did in Monster Zero. The Godzilla suit is well-proportioned and has a ferocious demeanor--a monstrous improvement over his distinctly frog-like appearance in his previous film, Son of Godzilla.

Apart from the DVD being the barest of bare bones releases, the most unfortunate aspect of the ADV release is that the dubbing is the miserable International version recorded in Hong Kong, rather than the far superior job recorded by Titra Sound Studios for the 1969 American International Pictures release. On the good side, the print is not bad, it's in wide-screen (though not anamorphic), and it's the same as the full-length Japanese version, which differs slightly from the American release (although in some respects, the AIP release is superior to the original; most notably, moving the opening march to the end, which improves the pacing a bit).

All in all, this ADV release is satisfactory, but only just. How wonderful it would be, at long last, to see a wide-screen release of Destroy All Monsters that features the AIP cut, if for nothing more than its superior dub.",1267401600,3,5422,5.233601841196778
943071,5,6304891784,"So apparently there are some elements on this disk that folks are irritated over, the altered dubbing and soundtrack changes seem to be the largest bone of contention, with lack of chapters and no special features a close second. As a longtime fan of the Godzilla series, I didn't notice either and wouldn't have noticed except for the other reviews posted here. I don't particularly care about the lack of chapters or extras on the DVD either.

What I do care about, and what most viewers should care about is this:
1. Godzilla
2. Rodan
3. Mothra
4. King Ghidorah
5. Gorosaurus
6. Anguirus
7. Varan
8. Baragon
9. Minilla
10. Kumonga
11. Manda
They are all here! Sure some barely make a cameo, but for the most part Toho emptied out its creature vault and packed this film to the hilt with our favorite fighting critters.

The basic story, which had been used already by Toho, and which would be used again later in the series, is that a pesky group of aliens want to use Earth's monsters as weapons against humanity in order to take over our world. Using mind control on the giant monsters, tons of cities around the globe get flattened in imaginitive and fun ways. Can mankind regain limited control of our monsters, or will the aliens destroy the Earth?

If you are a fan of Toho's giant monsters, then you must own this film!

If you're a serious Godzilla fan, why would you spend your money on this edition, when for a few dollars more you can get everything you see here PLUS a free copy of the soundtrack CD? You can't beat that.",1128211200,7,541,4.530612244897959
943186,4,6304891784,"(NOTE: this review is NOT for the ""50th Anniversary Edition"", rather the cheaper of the two available on Amazon)

Simplified Plot: The year is 1999, and a group of space aliens (women wrapped in aluminum-foil, basically) intend to dominate the Earth. They have gained control over the gigantic monsters of MonsterLand (an isolated island used to observe them safely) and have set them loose upon our cities to wreak havoc. The humans race is in definite danger, but what can we do? Can Godzilla and the others ever brake away from this spell? Will we survive this massive attack governed by these other-worldly enemies? It seems like hope is in sight when we temporarily break the diabolical spell over the towering creatures, but then the aliens unleash their secret weapon: King Ghidorah! It's now an all-out battle between the monsters! Who will win? The humans? The aliens? The monsters!?

For those curious, here are the included monsters (by their original Toho names, anyway):
Godzilla
Mothra
Rodan
Gorosaurus
Anguirus
Kumonga
Manda
Minilla
King Ghidorah
Baragon
Varan

Now for my personal opinion...
Some people have complained that the storyline focuses way too much on the human/alien struggle rather than the monsters. I completely agree. Despite a few screen shots of the mayhem unfolding in the cities, most of the beastie action takes place at the final battle scene -- where they all end up side by side to defeat Ghidorah. Indeed this scene is spectacular, but can one scene make a movie worth purchasing? After all, most of the film is a bore-fest where the humans are trying to figure out what the aliens are doing (and eventually, how they can stop them). Well, the reason to buy this is simple -- probably the same reason you're reading these reviews. As long as you're a fan of the cheesy rubber-suited creatures of old cinema, Destroy All Monsters is a way to enjoy the child-like fun of seeing your favorite Japanese monsters all in one movie, and essentially all in one battle. As long as you don't mind the stinky storyline and the lack of constant action, this should make a great addition to your DVD collection if only for the last big fight.

As for this particular DVD edition, that's where the trouble comes in. Let it be known that there is no menu page, so chapter-skipping is not an option (not even with the chapter skipping button! what the heck?). So basically you're buying a VHS that doesn't have to be rewinded after each viewing. Also, for those who've read about the bonus soundtrack CD, it's not included with this edition. The print and audio are fairly decent, yet it's these little things that make you think twice about owning this particular DVD edition.

In conclusion, Destroy All Monsters is a great movie for any lover of giant monsters flicks -- especially lovers of Godzilla and his legendary foes. It is the reason I gave four out of five stars. I just don't think the cheaper DVD is a very good buy, even for somebody that doesn't mind bare-bones DVDs. Still, even after knowing the negative aspects from other reviewers, I ordered this and can't say I'm disappointed. Just be warned, if you don't like crappy DVD's, you might want to consider buying the ""50th Anniversary Edition"", even though it's a bit more expensive. It's probably worth it.",1126483200,,3301,4.814814814814815
943187,3,6304891784,"As with most 1960's Godzilla movies; kinda hoakie & contrived dialogue, but entertaining none the less. If you can leave reality for about 90 minutes, then this movie, ""Destroy All Monsters"" is a better rate movie than I give it. The special effects are good for the time, & it actually has a pretty good plot. The Keyloks are beautiful enemies, and most of all of the monsters in the Toho & Honda movies are here. We even get to see Paris invaded...again! The only problem is that the DVD says that it is in 16:9 format, but is made in widescreen, which sucks if you have a 16:9 player. The description on amazon.com doesn't mention that this is a widescreen version either, as they're usually quite thorough in these details. Unfortunately, in this instance, this is not the case. THIS MOVIE IS MADE IN WIDESCREEN FORMAT! Besides that, the color on this video is awesome. Get the kids, pop the popcorn, & get ready for some old time monsterous fun!",1125619200,2,950,4.56140350877193
943282,3,6304891784,"Godzilla was certainly enjoying the 1960s, as Destroy All Monsters oh so effortlessly conveys. Released in 1968, this movie was to be one Godzilla's last in its most fruitful decade. The bulk of the Showa series of Godzilla movies were released in the 60s, including King Kong vs. Godzilla, Godzilla vs. Mothra, Godzilla vs. Monster Zero, Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster, Son of Godzilla, and the abysmal Godzilla's Revenge. Kaiju fans look upon this era with both great satisfaction and immense disgust: While there were some classic Godzilla movies released in this era, such as Godzilla vs. Mothra (Arguably the finest Goji movie ever made), some immense blotches also found their way to the screen (Son of Godzilla, Godzilla's Revenge). Destroy All Monsters falls somewhere in the middle of the spectrum.

Laden with bright, misplaced colors, an immensely cheesy story, and laughable visual effects, Destroy All Monsters can be considered both a nostalgic gem and an embarassment. The year is 1999, and of course mankind has extended its reach to space colonies on the moon and the rocketship Moonlight SY-9 flies missions to and fro in an utmost casual fashion. All of Earth's most dangerous monsters have been confined to ""Monsterland,"" a habitat that works under the magic of science. Woo, go science! Things are going well until a species of malevolent space women seize control of the monsters and use them to attack Earth's largest metropolises. Yes, the story is that bad.

Can anything better really be expected from a campy 60s trip? In fact, this God-forsaken story is arguably what makes the film fantastic to a degree: It actually has the bravery, the confidence to urinate a story about evil space women onto our screens. And it certainly goes the whole nine-yards with afformentioned urination as actors with an abysmal void of talent get into firefights with what appear to be toy guns, all the while wearing rubbery yellow space suits. Clearly, Destroy All Monsters has no shame, and it really is hard to be mad at any movie that's willing to be so outwardly ridiculous.

With a title like Destroy All Monsters, one is understandably going to expect an immense amount of monster action. Unfortunately (and ironically), the film gets a little too caught up in the writhingly bad human drama, and while the monsters get rollin' almost right away, the action sequences are limited. While the movies waves news reports in front of our faces of the monsters attacking Earth's most treasured cities, such as New York City, Moscow, and Paris, there is a gargantuanly disappointing lack of footage. It is by no stretch an exaggeration to say that there is less than four minutes in total of the monsters attacking these capital cities in the movie. Considering this is the movie's prime selling point, this is simply unacceptable. Destroy All Monsters tries to make up for it by offering a long sequence of the monsters trampling Tokyo, but we could watch any other kaiju eiga for that, and they would probably be better-crafted scenes to boot.

Yet Destroy All Monsters makes it almost worth it with its final fight sequence, in which all of Earth's monsters square off against the powerful King Ghidorah. It's a very effective fight all of the way through, starting with an impressive and menacing entrance by King Ghidorah. One of Destroy All Monsters' high points is that it creates a solid build-up of hate towards the its antagonists, which makes this fight all the more satisfying. Their confidence in their precious King Ghidorah is absolutely crushed as we witness Earth's finest pummel it in what can best be described as a big, sweaty, kaiju gang-rape. Even Minya, Godzilla's son, gets in on the action. This lone sequence alone is the movie's crowning achievment, and even if it does seem randomly placed (""Oh snap, you found our base! Well, uh, we have KING GHIDORAH! SO THERE!"") the movie would be a colossal failure without it.

In the end, Destroy All Monsters is a bit rough around the edges, but if you know what you're getting yourself into it can make for an enjoyable experience. If anything, it should go down in cinema history as a shining example of the 60s. Unlike most kaiju eiga, Destroy All Monsters doesn't even make the weakest of efforts to inject any sort of deeper meaning or symbolism to its story, but that's alright: Destroy All Monsters knows what it is. See it for the entertaining fight with King Ghidorah or as a memorial to the 60s, but stay far, far away if you're expecting anything more.",1125273600,4,4540,4.883268482490273

If there is a zenith in Japanese monster movies, or merely in seeing how many grown Japanese men will fight on one sound stage dressed in reptilian suits, then ""Destroy All Monsters"" is that movie !

Directed by experienced, monster movie director Ishiro Honda ( ""Godzilla vs Mothra"", ""Matango: Fungus of Terror"" and ""King Kong vs Godzilla""....to name but a few ! ), this time Earth is under threat from the ""Kilaks"".....a race of manipulative women ( aren't they all like that ? ) from the moon who seek to enslave the Earth by unleashing the previously ""imprisoned"" oversized monsters from Monster Island to destroy the world's capital cities. Godzilla destroys New York, Baragon ruins Paris, Rodan swoops over Moscow....and so on, and so on. The United Nations decides to fight back against the invaders and they send their snappy rocketship, Moonlight SY2 to seek out the evil ""Kilaks"" lair !

However, the cornered ""Kilaks"" still have one trick up their sleeve when they unleash the three headed Ghidirah to take on the Earth's monsters under the picturesque backdrop of Mount Fuji. This all out slugfest involves Godzilla, his smoke ring blowing son Minya, Spigas, Baragon, Anguilas, Mothra and other non-specific rubber reptiles as they finally beat Ghidirah and the ""Kilaks"", and then return to Monster Island to live happily ever after.

Unfortunately, this is just a re-issue of the same DVD released a few years ago. The film transfer is exactly the same as the one previously released by ADV films, which has a recently re-dubbed mono soundtrack. The ADV soundtrack is much inferior to the one originally produced for American International Pictures in 1968, which featured an excellent voice-cast and a different script. Apparently the AIP version can't be published because the ownership rights are in limbo. Based on the cover notes, I bought this DVD believing it had the original AIP voice-tracks. No such luck. The folks at ADV deliberately stretch the truth. The cover art claims it's the ""50th Anniversary Special Edition"", but Destroy All Monsters was made in 1968, which makes this DVD issue the 36th anniversary for the film (in 2004). The 50th year, is a reference to the first Godzilla movie ""Gojira"" made in 1954, but the text makes no mention of Gojira or Godzilla. It also claims to contain ""The original motion picture and soundtrack"", which is misrepresentation. The original film was Japanese language, and this DVD isn't even the original English version. I would've been a lot less disappointed if they had at least given this version some chapter stops and stereo audio (which there isn't). There's not even a menu for this low budget version. If you try to hit the chapter advance button, the movie starts over from the beginning. There's no menus, no extras, no subtitles, no secondary audio tracks, no trailer, no nothing. The only thing that's different from ADV's first issue of this movie, is the cover art and the addition of a music CD. The CD contains 30 mono-audio music tracks from the movie soundtrack. The music score is wonderful, but the audio is not stereo and the fidelity is only fair. My point of contention is that ADV is trying to fool us into believing this movie has the original audio soundtrack, but instead gives you fine-print on the back mentioning an extra music CD.

I'm not going to complain about the quality of the DVD release or the dubbing in English. For a Godzilla movie of this magnitute, this sounds a bit pointless. For me this film is the top of all the monster flicks. I,d also like to have it uncut and subtitled but i feel privileged and lucky just to own it in a DVD copy. That way i could watch it as many times as i want without damaging the movie. Now i'm even thinking of buying a second copy just to replace the first one in case something happens to it.
I first watched it at a summer theater when i was young and from that point i fell in love with it. I own all of the Godzilla films since i am a Godzilla maniac but this one surpass every other one, easily.
Inoshiro Honda's best movie ever and Ifukumbe's best soundtrack ever.
The story in a few words is the following:
Human race confined all the monsters in monster-island using some kind of transmitters with creates an invisible barrier surrounding the island. Aliens with bad intentions are setting them loose and afterwards they control them. Their primary orders are the demolition of every major city in the world. Later on humanity find the way to set the monsters free from the alien control and turn them against the Alien invaders. At that point the aliens have no other choice than to summon the space monster Ghidrah and set this party on fire.
As you all monster-movie lovers probably asumed by the story above, hell breaks lose on earth and we all can be the front watchers of this titanic rampage!! Godzilla saga DEFINATELY at its best moments. The only movie i expect and hope to throw this 1968 flick from the top of my list is Toho's upcoming Godzilla last project, ""Godzilla: Final Wars"".
I feel the need to express my graditute to Inoshiro Honda and his crew for making these kind of films(anyone seen ""Mysterians"" or ""Battle in outer space"" knows exactly what i'm talking about),which allow you to feel young again and send you on a fabulous journey throughout the boundries of your imagination.

943514,5,6304891784,"Remember when rating this movie; I am rating it first as a Godzilla movie and then as a B-Movie. In both the categories it excells. The acting is horrible, the plot is stupid, the monsters are fake, the dubbing is crap, the special effects can't impress anyone, yet this movie for some reason is very good. Where else can you find a movie when you can so easily list everything bad about it and then say, but it was really good afterwards.
There are tons of monsters in this movie and they all have their unique little quirks. (Godzilla's pre-fight scene air punches are totally classic) Rhodan only eats Dolphin- Japanease propaganda anyone?
What however makes the movie is the final fight scene between King Ghidrah and all of the earth monsters. When King Ghidrah is already grounded all the monsters just surround him and start fighting him like a bunch of school yeard bullies. One monster jumps on his neck and other pick up one of his heads and throws it against the ground. Essentially it is too hilarious to recount here.
The plot was just stupid in this movie. It is not worth recounting however what is a funny thing was that this movie was supposed to be based in 1999. They greatly overestimated what technology we would have. Well maybe Japan has that technology today. I mean you never know.

The movie itself is alright, it does have alot of monsters in it but alot of the footage in this movie is stock footage from other movies. Now you do expect that from Godzilla movies because they were on a low budget but this movie does it too much.
The plot is pretty basic and typical for a Godzilla movie, though the nature of the aliens is kind of interesting. The special effects are also typical for this era of Godzilla movies.
What I liked most about the movie is having all the monsters(or most of them anyway) and seeing them attack places other than Tokyo.
What I didn't like is the final battle being so short and well one sided for that matter, Ghidora is strong but he can't take that many monsters on for long.
The DVD itself offers no real extra features, in fact unless I'm blind there wasn't even a menu of any kind.
Overall, I give it 3 stars, typical plot and effects, lackluster DVD features, but decent action and of course its Godzilla, come on! If you're a big fan, obviously you need this DVD, if not, try one of Godzilla's other films.",1084492800,3,1205,4.2663755458515285

943518,3,6304891784,"VIDEO QUALITY:
Generally pretty good - the transfer has vivid colours and sharp images. There are a few scenes with some print damage, mainly during the final battle - this consists of some scratches, hairs and some small speckles. For the most part though it's in very good shape. Sadly there were a few problems with the DVD though - mainly some compression problems resulting in rainbows on sharp edges throughout the entire film, and that the film lacks anamorphic enhancement. On whole though, it's generally a sharp looking widescreen version of the film - something never seen in the US before.
AUDIO QUALITY:
The DVD only offers one audio track, the Toho International dubbing presented in mono (doubled up to make 2.0, but it's not true stereo). Despite the rather lacklustre dubbing, the track itself is in very good condition - I don't believe I heard any cracks, pops or other distortions, everything seemed good.
EXTRA FEATURES:
No features, no menu, no chapter stops. It works basically like a VCD - chuck it in and it plays the film. If you want to get to a particular part of the film you have to fast forward through the entire film to get there.
OVERALL:
Reasonable video quality, minus a the compression screw ups, and pretty good quality audio. The films itself is in very good condition, and it's good thing too because that's all the disc offers. Without a menu or chapter stops it's a pretty thin release, however that's been argued back and fourth between it being Toho or ADV's fault. At the end of the day it's the best release of the film you're ever going to get, unless you fork out $55 for the Region-2 DVD.",1083456000,4,1637,4.6482758620689655

With no Special Features section or even a decent Chapter Selection, I have to say that they just made this into DVD format for the sake of making one half-heartedly.

As a childhood fan, my nostalgic feelings had been all but lost. I know it doesn't seem like a big deal but I refuse to support such a horrible edition of this movie. How would you feel if your favorite childhood cartoon had new actor voice as opposed to the original? I am sorry but it just is not the same.

943621,4,6304891784,"""The year is 1999.  The United Nations Scientific Commission has established an exploratory base on the moon.  A rocket base is also functioning on Earth, and spacecraft leave for the moon on a daily schedule.""
When I heard the opening English narration, I had to laugh.  This video came out in 1998, so I thought, ""Oho, this takes place next year?""  Hmm, I didn't know they still used tape reels and large computers in 1999.  I know, this was made in in 1968, my birth year, of all years, so I'll be nice.
Meanwhile, near Ogasawara Island, there's an underwater base that studies the local marine life, while on the surface, there's a zone called Monsterland, which contains... all the Japanese language master tapes for all the Godzilla movies, prevented from access by the Amalgamated Union of English Dubbers of Japanese Movies.  All kidding aside, it houses the usual gang of monsters, who can't leave the island due to various defense mechanisms.  The base comes under attack, and while the UNSC is trying to find out what's going on, reports come in, courtesy of bad foreign accents, from Moscow and Paris, who are under attack by Rodan and Gorasaurus respectively.  Beijing, London, and New York City also come under attack.  So, how did the monsters escape?  And why isn't Tokyo under siege?  Never mind--Tokyo won't be so lucky later on.
The supervisors of the underwater base, Kyoko Manabe and Dr. Otani, clearly under some mind control, then introduce the investigating personnel from the moon rocket SY3, led by Kyoko's boyfriend Katsuo, to the Keelak people, i.e. a group of humanoid aliens (Japanese-looking, of course) who wear sparkly silver hooded spacesuits and whose leader always seems to have a really cheerful smile when she mentions her plans to create a new scientific society on Earth.  I compare her to those Happy Bunny stickers and notice a similar kitsch but cute perversity.  The goal is thus to regain control of the monsters, find out where the Keelaks are hiding, and to wipe the smile off that Keelak leader.
The same English narration is heard a couple times to explain events going on.  Now I expected the dubbing, and some goshawful dialogue, which does occur.  However, continuity mistakes?  The elderly British UNSC leader addresses Katsuo as Otani, which is a goof unless Katsuo's surname was also Otani.  Another is that the news announcer says Baragon is attacking Paris, whereas the monster seen destroying the Arc de Triomphe is clearly Gorosaurus.  One can also clearly see a dummy standing in for Otani falling out a window.  And couldn't Toho do better than painted hubcaps for the flying saucers?  Finally, the title of the movie, which does not define the goal of the UNSC.  They don't want to destroy the monsters--they want them back on Monster Island.  ARGH!
Of all the Godzilla movies, this one works better in that the action is split between the Earth and the moon, so there are two different theatres of battle.  The Moonlight SY3 rocket is well-realized, though despite its high technology, one might expect it to land like a shuttle and not like a rocket.  There also seems to be a shortage of dye, as all scientific personnel uniforms are either red or yellow (ha ha).  But the large monster gathering at the end is the highlight.  It's gets a bit rougher.  During an autopsy, Otani's body shows bruises, and blood actually pours from Kyoko's ears after her earrings are torn off, details I wouldn't expect on a Toho monster movie.  Naturally, there's the usual military operations, Godzilla stepping on toy tanks, rockets firing at monsters, using science as a solution (Monster Zero), but all these elements as well as others from the other Godzilla movies all come together despite obvious goofs and fluffs.  And it's shown in the original 2.35:1 Tohoscope, so that also can't be bad.",1059177600,2,3847,4.875384615384616

But anyone reading these reviews and thinking about buying the film on DVD already knows this, right? So let's look at the DVD instead.
As someone has so rightly stated in a previous review, this DVD is pretty appalling. First the positives - the transfer looks pretty good for an old foreign film and the widescreen letterbox format does the battle scenes justice. You get even more monster carnage than you'd have seen on TV! But now here is the moaning - the lack of basic extras. I usually take interactive menus and scene selection for granted when buying DVDs but even those aren't present here. So if, like me, you wanted to skip the talk and get to the giant monster fights then you have to go through the entire film slowly! I was playing this through a PS2 using DVD Region X. If you've used the PS2 to play DVDs, you'll know that it only searches very slowly - in fact it's probably quicker to watch the film in normal time! So this was a big disappointment. The dubbing on this DVD is the same version that we've been getting on TV and VHS for years here in the UK so that didn't bother me.
This is the only DVD version of the film I could get so I'm grateful that at least I own this gem of a monster flick. But it's an appalling DVD and a real kick in the teeth to anyone who loves the film.",1037232000,4,1460,4.2178571428571425

The special FX are typical for late 1960's monster movies, very poor and the human-to-human fight scenes are kind of lame.  A lot of people like this movie because it features all (actually most) of the good/bad monsters that appear throughout the series.  This is the part that gets me.  Its supposed to feature all monsters attacking King Ghidorah at a final battle, but two monsters:  ""Baragon"" and ""Varan"" are missing in action.  Baragon shows up the frontlines of the battle but dissapears during the fight.  Varan doesn't show up until the very ending when the monsters are back on Monster Isle. but he is only there for like 3 seconds and then he flies away...

Good monster fighting action, I like the fact the movie starts in the future (1999, it was the future back then!) and shows us a world where space exploration is commonplace and the world's monsters have been kept at Monster Island for study. aliens want to take over the earth however, so they let the monsters loose and all heck breaks loose.

I won't try to list all of the monsters (eleven total, I believe) because I had never heard of some of them and I can't remember every name.  Of course, Godzilla gets top billing, but Rodan, Mothra (the larva version), and Anguiras get a good bit of screen time; the other monsters are pretty cool except for the son of Godzilla, who looks even more silly than he normally would surrounded by a group of ""real"" monsters.  The plot is somewhat far-fetched, naturally, but it works pretty well.  It is the year 1999, and a new group of aliens decides to conquer the earth; the plan involves taking over MonsterLand (why not Monster Island?), controlling all of the monsters by some kind of radio waves, and unleashing them all on the world.  It's great fun to hear one newsman after another announce that a different monster is attacking cities across the globe, from New York to Paris to Moscow.  The aliens are pretty cheesy, dressing alike in metallic grey clothes, smiling a lot, and exuding peaceful intentions (just like Communists of the time?).  For some reason, when they make their intentions known, they tell Earthlings the means by which they are controlling the monsters and then give them 24 hours to decide between surrender and destruction.  They unleash the monsters on Japan five hours earlier than planned, but the head start they have given Japanese scientists comes back to haunt them.
While the Japanese rocket ship offers them a great advantage and allows them to ultimately destroy the aliens' secret base on the Moon, there are a few too many scenes of the ship taking off and landing.  The dubbing is also less than stellar, particularly in the case of the Englishman associated with the Japanese brain trust.  The fighting is pretty good, but there isn't quite enough of it.  While the monsters wreak havoc among the earth's major cities, they don't really engage in monster-a-monster combat until King Ghidorah shows up to defend the aliens--by this point, the aliens' control of earth's monsters has been broken.  That contest doesn't last very long, given that Ghidorah is going up against Godzilla's entire gang.  Ghidorah is my favorite Godzilla foe, so it is sort of disappointing to see him go into a fight that is far from balanced and fair.  I would rather see Godzilla and Ghidorah go at each other one on one.
Basically, this movie is a must-have for Godzilla fans as well as for monster lovers.  Nowhere else will you find this many monsters doing what they do best.  The special effects are quite good (with the exception of the son of Godzilla, of course), and the plot is interesting and exciting (if somewhat cheesy).",1006387200,12,2701,4.776344086021505

There are so many monsters in this movie that there are some I have never seen before, and I thought I had seen more than my fair share of monster flicks from the Land of the Rising Sun.  The excuse for the non-stop mayhem is that a sinister race of aliens is using Earth's own monsters to destroy every capital in the world (e..g, Godzilla takes out NYC).  The only chance for the human race is for the United Nations Star Ship Moonlight SYS (you have to love the name) to locate the secret hidden base of the Kilaks, which is somewhere on the moon.  If they can break the control of the aliens over the monsters, Earth has a chance!

True the scenes with the monsters are interesting as always, but they are few and far between with a lot of rather boring human action spread throughout.  Even the giant monster battle at the end is more like a brief skirmish.
Overall, not the worst in the series but certainly not the best, either.
Next is ""Godzilla's Revenge"".",986601600,2,567,4.835051546391752
943870,4,6304891784,"This flick was originally supposed to be the ""last"" Godzilla flick (gee, how many times have we heard that one?), and so to live up to the high expectations of such a movie, Toho pulled out all the stops for this all-star monster-fest.  Say what you want about the storyline (yet another attempt to mix the highly successful space-war dramas, a la ""Battle In Outer Space"", and the Godzilla formula, a la...well, you know), but the sheer amount of kaiju-star power makes this a must-have for even the most amateur of sci-fi fans.  As usual, the dubbing is terrible (so what else is new?), but the utter sense of unbridled freewheeling--not to mention really cool models & miniatures--really put modern sub-par efforts like ""Mission To Mars"" and ""Contact"" in their pitiful place.  If you're looking for even a remote connection to reality in this movie, FORGET IT.  Just sit back and forgive yourself for indulging yourself in such delectible (albeit rubberized) eye candy.  Enormous props to Ishiro Honda, Eiji Tsubaraya, Tomoyuki Tanaka, Akira Ifukube, Haruo Nakajima et al, for providing a truly wonderful guilty pleasure for the rest of us.
(p.s. the clarity of the DVD is such that you can even see the wires if you look close enough.  Now that's SHARP!)",978393600,,1257,4.877934272300469
943871,5,6304891784,"This my favorite Godzilla movie of the first, or Showa (the period in Japan in which Hirohito was emperor), series.  It's got all the best giant monsters: Godzilla, King Ghidorah, Mothra, Rodan, Manda (from Atragon, one of my favs), Baragon (from Frankenstein Conquers the World), Varan (from Varan, the Unbelievable), Gorosaurus (from King Kong Escapes), Minya (ugh), and Spiega/Kumonga (from Son of Godzilla).  All but Varan and Baragon get a good amount of screen time.  The city destruction scenes are great and the final battle is just awesome.  They all gang up on King Ghidorah and he gets a terrible beating.  The aliens are the usual people in silly suits.  The plot is really just a means to an end.  I don't mind, though.  The movie is a lot of fun. That's what counts.  The DVD has no extras and uses the international dubbing (cheap, poorly done), which is Toho's fault (they don't want Japanese buying this DVD before they put out their own).  The video is good.  The colors are vibrant, picture is sharp, but there are a good amount of scratches and lines in some parts.  The audio is mono, but the dialogue and the great score by Akira Ifukube aren't are clear.  The cover artwork is mediocre. Not very detailed, but it features a good amount of monsters.  There aren't any menus, it just takes you to the movie.  At least there's a keep case.
Movie: 10 out of 10 Video: 8 1/2 Audio: 7 Presentation: 5 Extras: 0 Overall: 8 out of 10.  Get it if you're a Godzilla fan.",977702400,8,1483,4.5606060606060606
943942,3,6304891784,"A little slow in spots sure (they could have given the monsters more airtime), but the all-star monster jam at the end makes it all worthwhile. Negatives: the print used isn't in the best shape, there's NO chapter skipping (the whole thing is one track), and I can't be the only one who wished there was also  a ""subtitled"" (original Japanese dialogue with English subtitles) option like they have with the anime DVDs. Maybe someone like Criterion can re-reissue this and take care of those particular flaws (and maybe throw in some ""extras"" as well!)",977184000,,551,4.8
943943,5,6304891784,"This is the magnum opus of the Showa series, featuring 11 (yes, you read  correctly, 11!) monsters, realized far better than in most of the other  movies of the period. The plot is about the standard alien invasion  premise, and the dialogue isn't all that great, but the hilarious  overacting in the dubbing makes it worthwile, and any lingering grudges  against the movie will likely dissapear after seeing the final fight scene  at Mt. Fuji. The model work is top notch, and would be reused for several  of the subsequent movies, none of which were nearly as good as this.  Despite that the series contiuned in a southward direction for the next  seven years, this really marks the end of it's golden age. At least it went  out with a REALLY big bang.",965347200,,754,4.601503759398496
943944,4,6304891784,"Ok people. I really love the fight scene in this movie. Sure, the rest of the movie was only semi-entertaining, but the grand finale had the best monster of all time, King Ghidorah(The original, alien version) versus at  least 10 of Earth's own radioactive monsters. I would buy this movie for  the final fight scene ALONE! Widescreen? YES! I'm in heaven!  This movie is  NOT for everyone and most people say it is ""Stupid"".....but if  you are a TRUE fan......then just watch the final fight scene! Japanese  Monster Movies rule!",964915200,3,529,4.822222222222222
943945,4,6304891784,"If you like cheesy japanese monster movies with scattered plot lines and  absolutely no regard for physics; this DVD is for you!  I loved it as a kid  and had even more fun seeing it as an adult.  A great geek bash disc!
On  the downside; it is an average DVD release.  There are no chapter skips for  those snacktime pauses.  In addition, the dubbed voices aren't the original  dubbed voices, but, hey, they're still out of sync. ^_^
Recommended for  all hardcore Godzilla fans, but only four stars for the average DVD  quality.",962236800,,529,4.5212765957446805
943946,4,6304891784,"Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and just about every other monster from the pre-70's Japanese city-stomping films join forces to take on the three-headed King Ghidorah.
As a curio or light entertainment this is  great.  But somebody looking for serious sci-fi ought to look elsewhere.  The main problem with this film is the dubbed voices, many of which sound  like the vocalists were treating the whole thing as a complete  joke.
Though the film doesn't have the dark atmosphere or  thought-provoking undertones of the earlier Godzillas, it's still one of  the best and most watchable of the campier films of the series, and fans of  monsters will certainly have a field-day.",959644800,,668,5.064220183486238
943947,5,6304891784,"Here it is...the Holy Grail of all Godzilla movies!  Once an elusive treasure, Destroy All Monsters is finally available in a nicely done, letterboxed videocassette.  It stands as the pinnacle of achievement for  the Honda/Tsubaraya/Arikawa/Ifukube/Tanaka team.  Their ingenuity and  inventiveness in the face of crippling economic times puts most big-budget  filmmakers to shame.  The scope and variety of the effects alone deserve  applause.  Contrary to uninformed opinion, making Godzilla films is not an  easy thing to do.  The story moves along briskly and, in spite of the  dubbing, the performances work well.  Let's get one thing straight right  now;  dubbing is NOT the fault of the Japanese filmmakers!  So, let's give  criticism where criticism is due, shall we?  This film is a classic that  will endure long after the latest bloated blockbuster is mildewing at the  bottom of a dumpster.",959472000,,901,5.3
943948,5,6304891784,The monster fight at the end makes the movie worthwhile.  The best part about this movie is that KING GHIDORAH DIES!  YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY!  Too bad he had to be resurected in Godzilla vs. Gigan.,958867200,,192,4.757575757575758
943949,3,6304891784,"Japan is under attack again by aliens controlling Earth's monster population. The monsters wreak havoc on the major cities around the world. In a climactic fight sequence, Godzilla and the guys gang up on King Ghidorah. The pace of the film is herky-jerky. The special effects consist of actors dressed in rubbery monster suits trampling on toy sets, and awkward puppetry. If you grew up watching the many ""Godzilla vs. Everybody"" movies, this all-star monster tribute may be viewed as a nostalgic treat. Those who enjoyed the original ""Godzilla"" and ""Rodan"" films as grim allegories of the hazards of nuclear energy will note the change in style. Allegory became camp entertainment earlier on in the series. The grim mood of the first Godzilla flick changed to chuckle-headed charm (for lack of a better word). Typical low budget dubbing adds to the snickering humor. In fairness, this is not the fault of the original film. This movie enjoys a good reputation among loyal and true Japanese sci-fi fans. Entertainment is subjective. ;-)",951868800,3,1037,5.0701754385964914
943950,4,6304891784,"The movie, of course, was great. So many monsters on screen at one time. It truly is one of the best Gojira pix to come out of Japan. The widescreen presentation on DVD preserves the integrity of the film. However, take  note. The DVD has flaws! No main menu, no chapter stops, no theatrical  trailer, no nothing! No bells and whistles of any kind! The least they  should have done was to include chapter stops so you can go right to the  action and jump past the cheesy dubbed dialog. Also, having no main menu  means the movie plays over and over again until you press ""stop"".  Stupid! The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of five is the way they  put it out on DVD.",951782400,2,675,4.2265625

944043,4,6304891784,"This movie has a powerful and moving musical score.  The ""Main Title"" and ""Destroying the Remote Control"" are the two best ones.  The monster involvement of Manda, Baragon, and Varan are brief, but  it was good to see them in a movie other than their debut ones.  The  Killaks give a good performance that makes you think they really are evil.  DESTROY ALL MONSTERS is Godzilla's ninth film and Toho's twentieth film  overall.  That's why it had such an enormous budget and a large but good  cast of characters.  If it was the 60's right now, I'd say that this movie  would be hard to top.",945475200,4,589,4.462264150943396

There was also too many spaceship scenes and that took alot away from the  story. The scenes of the monsters rampaging through the world's cities was  just about 30 seconds combined. WAY too short!
