8762142,5,B01G2HYUVY,"My son who has autism, loves this show. I think its the bold colors, surprising but easy to follow action, and magic that he likes the most. He's best able to identify with the clown in this show since she's a silent character and doesn't use words to communicate. He laughs hard just at the sight of her. There are only a few DVDs that he asks to watch over and over again and this one seems to have become even more popular than his Thomas the Tank collection.",1464220800,,462,4.202247191011236
