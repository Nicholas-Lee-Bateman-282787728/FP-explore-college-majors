7909121,2,B00000GO6I,"Fugitive Rage is a disappointing little adventure with just enough of a budget to look professional but not enough talent in the right places. Its lead star, Alexander Keith (credited as Wendy Schumacher), once described themselves as hoping to become the female Van Damme, but Im sorry to say that this movie  isn't even up to Van Dammes standards. Its an action movie with bad action, and a weak attempt at a feminist feature by people who definitely aren't feminists.

The story: Sent to prison for the attempted murder of a mobster (Jay Richardson,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hollywood-Chainsaw-Hookers/dp/B00JRSK5GA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers</a>), police officer Tara McCormick (Alexander) is offered her freedom by a shady government agent (Tim Abell,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soldier-of-Fortune-Inc/dp/B00001U0NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soldier of Fortune, Inc</a>) in exchange for renewing her assassination attempt.

The quality of the action is average, at best. There are a few shootouts, but they're so impersonal that you won't care about them. Theres a goofy instance wherein Tara is hit by a car and hood-surfs until the vehicle inexplicably crashes, but this too is boring. This leaves us with the five fight scenes, but their quality isn't much better. While Keith is a legitimate martial artist, her fights are plagued by a variety of problems: if they're not poorly blocked or clumsily edited, they're painfully slow moving or just simply feature bad choreography. If you want to see Keiths moves utilized a little more gracefully, check out the Michael Dudikoff vehicle&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Counter-Measures/dp/B00000IQBV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Counter Measures</a>, but don't get your hopes up for this one.

Dramatically, all of the performers do a decent job, and theres even a little chemistry between Keith and Shauna OBrien (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friend-of-the-Family/dp/B00000IYR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friend of the Family</a>) as her cellmate. The problem is that the boring screenplay demands so little of these performers that virtually anybody could have played the characters. Surprises are few and innovation is nonexistent, unless the clumsy attempts to turn this into a girl power movie can be called clever. Director Fred Olen Ray and producer Jim Wynorski have gone on record stating their condescending opinions on female representation in B-movies, and the things theyve decided to highlight in the movie reflect these. Theres gratuitous nudity and sex, violence against women, recurrent sexist (and racist) dialogue, lurid descriptions of violence, and a sadistic lesbian warden. Aside from the fact that none of this is counterbalanced by simply having a physically powerful woman as the star, such features give the film a mean-spirited edge thats really too much for it to withstand. Despite its lazy pro-woman overtones, Fugitive Rage disingenuously panders to the 18-36 male demographic and suffers for it.

Even if you're not particularly put off by what I just pointed out, I still cant recommend this one at all. Die-hard B-movie enthusiasts may find mild delight in its corniness, but even they will be likely to wonder whether it was worth digging out the old VCR for. Leave it be.",1471737600,,3472,6.0920245398773005
7909122,2,B00000GO6I,"I'm sure the fact that I saw this flick on an obviously pirated tape that I found on the street (I'd be pissed off if I actually spent money on this garbage) contributed to my frustration with the movie.  I enjoy movies that are ""so stupid that they're great"", but I just don't know how to appreciate something that seems to intentionally leave so many holes in the plot.  I was continually amazed by how dumb things were, time after time, consistent, persistent stupidity.  And the stupidity is so obvious that I'm sure it was done that way intentionally.

At one point in the movie, two thugs are driving behind Tara, as she runs down the very middle of the road away from them, she stops in her tracks, and cringes as the thugs are thrilled to be hitting her (as they're assigned to kill her).  She winds up with her face smudged against their windshield, but manages to hold on pretty well as they continue to speed down the road.  Somehow, in a very physically awkward move (that could only be achieved by Tara, and perhaps Neo in the Matrix), she propels herself off of the windshield of the car and onto the grass on the side of the road.
Interestingly, the guys are so dumb and slow to react, that by the time they realize they should be stopping the car and going in reverse to catch Tara, they wind up *somehow* causing the car to explode.  I thought that maybe it was caused by them running into another car on the side of the road, but their car actually overturned due to the force of the explosion, and stopped moving as it came to rest behind the other car on the side.  So tell me, if it exploded before hitting the 2nd car, what the hell caused the explosion?  And why, after such a tremendous, impressing explosion for a B movie, did the thugs actually crawl out of the car and start shooting?  And WORSE, after being hit by their car at high speed, Tara gets up and runs away!!!

7909123,5,B00000GO6I,"""Fugitive Rage"" was directed by the great Fred Olen Ray, who also makes a cameo at the end of the film as a mob attorney.  This movie is one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  Tara McCormick (Wendy Schumacher) is sent to prison for the attempted murder of crime boss Tommy Stompanato (Jay Richardson).  Inside the gray bar hotel, she is approached by government agent James O'Keefe (Tim Abell) to finish the job she started and kill Tommy, in exchange for her freedom.  Tara grudgingly accepts the deal.  Tara first stays in a safe house after getting out of prison.  That is where she meets Miss Prince, played by the late, great Katherine Victor.  Meanwhile, Tommy Stompanato is back in his heavily guarded mansion, with his right-hand man Ryker (Ross Hagen).  Tommy is being nursed back to health by the gorgeous Nurse Wendy (Nikki Fritz).  Tara and Tommy are destined to eventually meet in his mansion.  They have a big showdown near the end of the movie, which only one survives.  Tara McCormick is great at martial arts and action sequences.  As an actress, the best I can say is, she's in great shape.  Interestingly, Tara now goes by the name of Alexander Keith.  I wonder what kind of shape Alexander Keith is in!",1058745600,,1221,4.671361502347418
