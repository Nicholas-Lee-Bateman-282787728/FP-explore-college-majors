8415096,2,B0043LTMTM,"The movie is bad on a lot of levels. It is not really a western. While it takes places in a futuristic western society, it is not really sci-fi. It is more of an action flick that spins its wheels.

There is a town sheriff and his singing cowboy brother who cares more about women than making a living. There first encounter with the mob is when they are harassing a woman dressed in undergarments. At times one of her dress/slip straps are down, then they are both up, and then she has one down again. The scene apparently had multiple takes and she wasn't dressed the same for each one. There are more continuity goofs in the film.

The cowboy was making love to the wrong girl when the mobsters break in to take him out. Through it all, he survives and his sheriff brother gets killed. The cowboy ends up in jail, then out in 5 years and now seeks revenge against ""Hawk"" who owns the town and also runs an insurance scam. The movie is offbeat, original, but not well done. There are no real plot twists and the dialouge might put you to sleep. No f-bombs. No nudity. Grainy quality.",1314144000,,1085,4.313725490196078
