Just kidding.  Different people have different tastes.  I like a crap movie as well as anyone.  I actually appeared in one once.  Look for a movie called Blood Diner.  Yeah, that's me.  Businessman #1.  So, having been an extra in a low budget horror film in the 80s I can speak from a position of expertise about a super incredibly low budget sort of horror film, mostly Ed Wood rip-off flick.

  It isn't directed by Ed Wood, only loosely based on a pulp fiction novel written by Ed Wood so they claim.  The Amazing Criswell couldn't be more fake.  That's obvious for many reasons most obvious being the fact that his prediction that ""In the future we will be completely subjugated by the State.  You will live under certain prescribed laws and that's all there is to it."" has pretty much come true and the real Amazing Criswell never had any predictions come true.

  Apparently they made the film in 1999 but attempted to make it appear to have been made many decades earlier contemporary to authentic Ed Wood movies.  The thing uses Black and White photography.  The camera angles and just general production quality would repulse even Ed Wood.  I believe the film makers intended only to capitalize on the Ed Wood popularity re-kindled in the late 90s.  Save your time, this movie is a fake and a bad one.  Sort of like a knock off Cabbage Patch Kid.  The real ones are always ugly but well made ugly, and that's what makes it so cute, but a fake is so ugly it is saddening.  This movie truly is saddening.  Honestly, don't do it. It isn't funny bad or way over the top bad, it's just bad.  God-awful.",1380844800,2,1804,4.504643962848297
8387264,5,B0031TZXSG,"I couldn't get enough of this low-budget movie based on some book by Eddie Wood. Snappy, happy, and just the right amount of camp without going overboard. I love all the old film clips, scratched up visuals, and how can you resist Criswell?",1263168000,5,240,4.604651162790698
