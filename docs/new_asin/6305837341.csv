1082428,5,6305837341,"One the great surfing films of the fifties and early sixties, Bruce Brown's ""Barefoot Adventure"" is 100% fun. Made during what many consider to be the greatest era in surfing, the film has incredible footage  and a nice jazzy soundtrack. Back then, the standard surfboard was, on  average, 9 to 10 feet in length. Nowadays, these boards are known as  ""longboards"". Older surfers will appreciate the stylish surfing,  while the newer breed of ""retro"" longboarders can get a chance to  see some of the legends in action. A simpler time and a prelude to Brown's  masterpiece, ""The Endless Summer"".",960940800,14,594,4.94949494949495

7896124,5,6305837341,"""Barefoot Adventure"" is another one of ""Bruce Brown's Greatest Film's""... if you know him he did; ""On any Sunday"", and ""Endless Summer"" more Great One's he has done ... He made his movies known back in the 60's...when Surf'n was most kid's thing to do if the lived by the sea, and even if they didn't...they are about the best that were out to see back then. Great Shot's from around the world, in all kind of Surf'.. a must to own ... that's why I got them.",1347321600,,458,4.215909090909091
7896125,4,6305837341,"If you like surfing or the Endless Summer, this is right up your alley.  Bruce Brown did this before Endless Summer but this is done in a very similar fashion, narration by Bruce viewing great surfing.  He has great shots of the surfing in various places. Not as good as Endless Summer, but right up there close to it. LorRae",1202428800,,325,4.4
7896126,5,6305837341,"This is a great DVD!  It was produced in the '60's, but this doesn't take away from the DVD.  Great classic longboard surfing through hawaii and california.  Narrated by Bruce Brown, who gives a short history of each surfing spot shown and footage of big name surfers in the 1960's.  A great movie for anyone, big surf and small surf as  well as humerous pass time activities.  I suggest you buy a copy!",1072828800,7,403,4.4520547945205475
7896127,5,6305837341,"Bruce Brown narrated all his movies, and the Santa Monica Civic was always packed with boys, mostly.  This movie was his first to have an actual music score.  It still impresses me that the audience was so well-behaved and no dope that I ever noticed.  (Marlboros, wheat jeans, Pendleton shirts, and juarachi sandals over white athletic socks was the uniform, or horizontal wide striped T-shirt.) I began surfing at 16, seeing all of BB's surfing movies, and doing the Surfer Stomp to Dick Dale and his Deltones at Balboa.  I just had my orig '61 Bud Shank BAREFOOT ADVENTURE album transferred to CD.  (My orig Dick Dale album will be on CD soon.) This movie is a classic, just like Jan & Dean, The Beach Boys and KFWB's music of that era with DJ Bill Balance.  It was a time of fun and innocence which I wish my grandchildren could experience.

7896128,5,6305837341,"If you longboard, or are into classic west coast jazz, then this movie is a must.
The featured surfer is Del Cannon, the ""Sir Lawrence Olivier"" of the surf movie. This movie has it all, great vintage south shore fun, rare point break at Makaha, rare footge of some fabulous surfers of the 60's (what style!).  I loved ""an early Donald Takayama doing an early wipeout"".
Plenty of Bruce Brown shenanigans as well, like when Del Cannon tries to make his own blank.  That's as funny as any episode of 'Jackasss'.
A charming view into a simpler day and age.
And the soundtrack!! WOW!!  Bud Shank & Co. provide cool west coast jazz that is both sophisticated and appropriate for the film.  Like a cool sea breeze, and then like a powerfull ride down the Banzai Pipeline, Shank provides memorable music.
Better then 'Slippery' and 'Hollow Days', and in my opinion, 'Endless'.  A true gem!  Buy it.",989020800,16,890,4.6369426751592355
7896129,5,6305837341,"The first sentence of my review of ""Barefoot Adventure"" should read ""One of the great surfing films..."", not ""One the great surfing films...""
