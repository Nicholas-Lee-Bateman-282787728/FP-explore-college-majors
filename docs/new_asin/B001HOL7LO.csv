8309257,5,B001HOL7LO,"Fatal Desire is based on a true story inspired from the book, 'Fatal Error.'

Eric Roberts,'Joe,' an ex-alcohol/policeman, newly divorced, single father, works in a casino, as a pit-boss, in Atlantic City, NJ. Joe enjoys spending free time in chat rooms. While online, he replies to a question asked by, 'Sexy Kitty,' Anne Heche.
After a few months emailing back and forth, he asks to meet her. 'His first mistake.' While Joe is working, Sexy-Kitty shows up at the casino, and introduces herself, revealing her true name, Tanya Sullivan.

The first night, Tanya is up-front with Joe..confesses she's married, and has a daughter. Neither care, and the love-affair begins.

From that point on, the tales Tayna reveals to Joe are lies. She tells him she loves him, is pregnant with his child, her husband beats her...the worse lie stems when she tells him her husband's friends raped her, and she lost the baby.

Madly in love with her, he decides to do whatever necessary to get back at Sexy's husband...perhaps even murder???

I'll leave the rest up to viewers who decide to buy Fatal Desire.

I don't know the movie's rating, but it contains parts not meant for childrens' eyes.

Although Amazon doesn't sell Region 1, Fatal Desire, the movie can be purchased on Lifetime's website, brand new, 'sorry Amazon,' for 19.99. It's worth every penny.

Makes one wonder if meeting online is worth it. lol.",1308787200,3,1398,4.8940677966101696
