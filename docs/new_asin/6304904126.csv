943601,3,6304904126,"""The Eagle"" is probably silent screen star Rudolph Valentino's best film. A delightful romantic swashbuckler set in the 18th century Russia (although costume-wise it looks 19th and early 20th century), it is full of action, romance, and also plenty of humor. Valentino is a lieutenant in the czarina's army who becomes a sort of Russian Zorro in order to avenge his father's murder by a neighboring landowner who had stolen his land. His plans for revenge go awry when he falls in love with the charming and lovely daughter of his enemy played by Vilma Banky, who would be reteamed with Valentino in his final film, ""The Son of the Sheik."" ""The Eagle"" was directed by Clarence Brown who went on to direct Greta Garbo, and made a number of classic sound films including ""National Velvet.""
""The Eagle"" as a film deserves 5 stars but I can only give this new DVD print 3 stars. Unfortunately, the poor picture quality of this DVD is from the Killiam Collection and is released by Image Entertainment. It has an organ score which I found to be so-so.
...The only real plus here with this DVD is there are chapter titles so you can jump to your favorite scenes. There are no other extras here.",1026518400,24,1188,4.6084905660377355
943602,4,6304904126,"THE EAGLE was something of a comeback picture for Valentino. His popularity sagged after the disastrous MONSIEUR BEAUCAIRE in which he played a foppish aristocat who was a little too foppish for 1920's audiences. This story of a Russian Robin Hood taken from Pushkin was just what he needed to regain his lost fan base. It also gave him the opportunity to let his natural comic flair come forth and really be himself much like Douglas Fairbanks or later Errol Flynn.

Rudy took no chances with this film. He got a top flight director in Clarence Brown who would later become Garbo's favorite. He got William Cameron Menzies to design the sets and a wonderful performance from Louise Dresser as Czarina Catherine the Great. Their scene together at the beginning is a delight to watch even on repeated viewings. Vilma Banky makes a great heroine and would work with Valentino again. This movie rather than THE SHEIK or BLOOD AND SAND is the ideal introduction to Valentino.

This DVD version is virtually the same as the old VHS version although the picture is marginally better and so 4 stars instead of 5. While it's great to have the Killiam Collection coming out on DVD, I just wish that some new restoration work had been done on this film. The other two (BELOVED ROGUE & TUMBLEWEEDS) are in better shape although they could use some work as well. Still these are superior to the old VHS copies and are likely to be the best we'll have for awhile. Lee Erwin's old organ score is a good one but it could have been sonically enhanced.",1025136000,7,1535,4.619047619047619
943603,4,6304904126,"This is my favorite Valentino movie. It allows him to use his natural talent as a comedian while still fulfilling what his audience expected of his as ""the great lover"".
Valentino plays Vladimir, a young Cossack officer who spurns the advances of Catherine the Great. (An amusing reversal especially when viewed along with the Sheik movies) Unfortunately, Vladimir's father wirtes to him begging him to get the Czarina's help. He has been swindled by a friend and is dying. Vladimir can do nothing but go home and watch his father die a broken man. He vows vengeance against Karilla, who betrayed his father, and becomes a sort of Russian Zorro called the Black Eagle.
Another unfortunate twist, Karilla has a daughter and since she is played by the lovely Vilma Banky you can guess what happens. Vladimir is smitten and is now stuck between loyalty to his father and band of followers and his love for her. Banky guesses who Vladimir really is right away (in spite of his disguises) and tries to get him to spare her father. Of course, Vladimir will have none of it and it looks like trouble until Vladimir is caught by the soldiers of the revengeful Catherine.
What happens next? Watch and see!
Valentino handles his swashbuckler duties with an airy charm. (A shame he never played the Scarlet Pimpernel!) His scenes with Louise Dresser's Catherine are particularly good. She is trying to charm him, he is trying to find a polite way out. Dresser thoroughly deserved her Oscar nod and it's too bad that Valentino was not given one as well. The rest of the supporting cast is also very good, Vilma Banky plays her usual role, the nice girl with a temper, and has an obvious chemistry with Valentino.
That said, this DVD, while ok, is not the greatest. The print quality is so-so and points. Bit of dust and lint got in the way of the transfer and can be distracting. The score is pipe organ. There are no extras besides scene selection. All in all, not an improvement on the VHS releases but you may as well buy it if you have an all DVD collection.
Check out this movie to watch the Valentino legend yourself but don't expect too much from the DVD.",1025136000,17,2150,4.6015625
943604,5,6304904126,I am a very big Rudolph Valentino fan.  I love this movie.  He just couldn't get any better than in this movie.  The part with the Empress is the best.  The look on his face is fabulous.  I have seen just about all of Rudy's movies and this ranks as my second favorite.  The first is Son of the Sheik.  Vilma Banky was a beautiful star and was very good in this movie also.,1017014400,9,373,3.9594594594594597
943605,5,6304904126,"This movie is a light action/romance/comedy which manages to balance all of the elements well. If you have never seen a silent movie, this is a marvelous place to start.
Valentino's preformance is charming as a ""nice kid"" who, after his father's death, becomes an outlaw. Matters are complicated by the fact that he has rebuffed the advances of Czarina Catherine the Great earlier in the movie. Matters become more complicated when he falls in love with his enemies sweet daughter. Matters become complicated still more when he takes a post as her French tutor in order to exact hsi revenge on her father.
While all of the comedy is excellent, the throw away bits are the best such as when Valentino is about to give Vilma Banky a ring but then it gets stuck on his finger or when he adds a few zeros to the reward offered for his capture on a wanted poster.
Wonderful, would recommend to anyone interested in classics and silent cinema.",999216000,6,937,4.616766467065868
943606,5,6304904126,"Based on Pushkin's story, this is a fascinating Valentino film, as it's one in which he uses his marvelous comedic talent.
As Vladimir Dubrovsky, AKA ""The Eagle"", he's a Robin Hood character that falls in love with the daughter of his greatest enemy. He is also wanted ""dead or alive"" for having spurned the attentions of the Czarina (Louise Dresser is great as the lusty empress). He also masquerades as a French teacher, and is exquisitely graceful and romantic throughout the entire film. The thing to note in all Valentino performances are his expressive hands. Watching them, one would think they were moving to music. All his movements are imbued with a fluid elegance, but his hands are extraordinary.
Sadly, this film from 1925 could use restoration. It's fuzzy and the white or brighter portions fade out...however, it's better than nothing. This is a classic silent film, and should be viewed at least once, to see this beautiful actor, who's special spirit lives on through his work.",978998400,5,994,4.958083832335329

I especially love the soup scene!

I read that it was during the filming of this movie he learned that Rambova was leaving him (going on a ""Marital Vacation"") and his ulcer started to really give him trouble.  Yet, none of this shows in this wonderful movie.

The music is not extremely poorly chosen in all cases, but is terribly inappropriate in the scene where Doubrovski Sr. dies. An entire sequence is completely missing where Valentino massages the neck of the female lead. The Alpha version is actually a better transfer (which is saying a lot). Go with the Killiam collection version. In the absence of a DVD release of the Image Videodisc version from the early 90s with the Carl Davis score, it's probably the best out there.",1338854400,2,537,4.723404255319149

His character is similar to that of Tyrone Power in ""The Mark of Zorro.""  I didn't mind the transfer at all.  And like silent movies, I think the world could do with a lot less talk and a lot more positive action.",1304208000,,369,4.382352941176471
943759,3,6304904126,"In this good natured costume romp, Rudolph Valentino plays a Russian officer who deserts rather than make love to Catherine the Great (see their scenes together and you'll know why) and returns to his hometown to have his revenge on the man who cheated his father out of his land and who keeps a bear in his wine cellar because, well, that's the sort of things bad guys do, I guess. Disguising himself as a French tutor, his plans are complicated when he falls in love with his arch-enemy's daughter (Vilma Banky). You can guess the rest, but what the heck, it's great fun and eagle-eyed viewers may even spot a young Gary Cooper somewhere in the crowd.

Lavishly designed by William Cameron Menzies and stylishly directed by Clarence Brown, Valentino's flair for comedy is well to the fore here. His innuendo-laden comic scenes with Louise Dresser's matronly Catherine the Great are hysterically funny, the dialogue and title cards often very amusing ('Revenge is sweet, but sometimes a woman is sweeter'), with some delightful early exchanges between hero and heroine, and if the end is too contrived even for this light a concoction, the whole cast have fun, and so will you.

Unfortunately the DVD releases are all disappointing, losing it a star, but unless the film is ever restored it's a case of making do with what's available.",1292716800,3,1336,4.829694323144105
943760,5,6304904126,"What a wonderful surprise to find this gem! I was unfamiliar with the silent film genre and thought Rudolph Valentino was just a beautiful man with sultry eyes.  As it turns out, he was a wonderful, sensitive actor with a great sense of humour.  I love his depiction of the Eagle, and the on-screen chemistry between Valentino and Banky is a joy to watch.  At first, the music score was a little distracting, but grew on me as the movie progressed.  I love this film and highly recommend it.",1290556800,,491,4.48314606741573
943761,5,6304904126,"Those who know little about Rudolph Valentino other than the dark image of him often presented today, painted by gossip and the passage of time, will be greatly surprised by his skill and humor as an actor in this terrific film. Filled with romance and adventure, there is a real sense of fun here, as though Valentino was quite aware of his own image at the time and chose to give a wry wink to it.

The set direction of William Cameron Menzies is beautifully photographed by George Barnes in Hans Kraly's fun screenplay of romance getting in the way of revenge. When that romance involves the lovely Vilma Banky, known mostly today for her films opposite Valentino, the quandry is a difficult one. She is shown to great advantage throughout the film, one particular scene where she kneels by her bedside table in a nightgown, searching for a way to sway the man she loves away from revenge, proof that her baby-faced charm rivaled any female star of the era.

Rudolph Valentino is Lt. Vladimir Dubrousky. When he rescues a runaway coach with Mascha Troekouroff (Vilma Banky) in it, the wheels are set in motion for a great adventure. It is the Czarina's (Louise Dresser) steed Vladimir appropriates during the valiant deed, but upon her meeting with the young soldier, her heart melts and she uses her power to procure his love. But Vladimir has only signed on to fight, not for this!

He returns to his home with a bounty on his head, only to find his father near death due to a scoundrel named Kyrilla. While the Czarina finds romance with one of her Captains, whom she promotes to General, Valentino swears vengence when his father dies, donning a mask as The Black Eagle. If this sounds like fun, that's because it is, and shows a side of the idol rarely seen.

Though it's all done seriously, Valentino's charm and charisma come through loud and clear, giving this film a sense of humor. Vladimir runs across the lovely Mascha once again, and grabs an opportunity to be near her and quench his thirst for vengence as well. Mascha's father, of course, is the evil Kyrilla. When Vladimir comes to their home in the guise of her French tutor, an incident in a wine cellar when he saves her life reveals to her his true identity. Will she opt for vengeance, or love?

There is a marvelous ending to this one I won't spoil for the first time viewer. Director Clarence Brown, not widely regarded for his action films, allows Valentino to let loose in what turned out to be one of his finest pictures. An appropriate theatre organ score accompanies the Killiam Collection dvd from Image, but viewers are forewarned that having seen at least three versions of this film, pristine prints do not appear to be available at this juncture. Those only wishing to get a peak would be well advised to shop around here a bit. This one is very watchable, however, and highly recommended for fans of the Great Lover.",1270080000,3,2904,4.62015503875969
943762,5,6304904126,"This movie's main attraction is Valentino playing a Russian nobleman,from an aesthetic perspective,  just watching him wearing a Russian hat studed with the Imperial Eagle and with a cape to match, is enough to justify seeing the film.

He is in love with Mascha, (played by Vilma Banky) the daughter of his worst enemy, Kyrilla Troekouroff ( James Marcus) who is just an awful character as a tyrannical feudal lord, that enjoys among other things tasteless jokes, like sending his guests down to the cellar to be scared out of their wits by a chained bear.
The costumes by Adrian are totally anachronistic. No Russian nobleman was dressing like a medieval boyar by the time of Catherine II, here played by Louise Dresser who does look very much like the aging empress, as depicted in her portraits, but acts more like a capricious society matron with delirium of grandeur when Valentino turns her down. Her childish mannerisms and reactions are delights in the art of hamming up.

 Mascha at one point is very casually dressed in the 1920's fashion while out on a carriage ride, with a similarly attired chaperone, although she can also wear a pearl-studed huge concoction on her head while having dinner,  that is inspired on the Russian ""kokoschnik"" headgear, but this Hollywood version should never have been worn a minute before midnight, at the earliest.

At times Valentino's clothes jump ahead a generation or two from the story and is very nicely attired in 19th Century garb, so tight that I wonder how he could breathe or sit down, on the upside one can actually appreciate why his physique's perfection, and reputation as a lover,  was not exclusive to the handsome face. But whether in Russian costume or not he is superb as a dashing hero in this adventure story, very similar to Zorro, (black mask included) which actually is pretty close to the original ""Dubrovsky"" by Pushkin.  It is also hard to believe while watching the film where Valentino is swashbuckling away that he would be dead in the next year.

Vilma Banky, a Hungarian Beauty that was nicknamed ""The Hungarian Rhapsody"" when she came to America was a big star in the mid-twenties. She had a face perfect for the silent screen and an appetite for male attention that must have been as great as her delight in dressing with chiffon. Her chemistry with Valentino is evident from the start, which was to win her the role for his next and last movie, ""Son of the Sheik"" (1926). They have a charming, humorous way of communicating and their expressions truly do not need any dialogue for translation.

Apparently this movie was in better condition in another laser disc copy. I have never seen it, and though this version would benefit from a good restoration, it is still good enough to watch, which is strongly recommended as it is a great showcase of the charm, allure and charisma that made Valentino an immortal star of the early cinema.",1248048000,3,2917,4.78131212723658

Eventually he becomes a bandit known asThe Eagle and falls for a beautiful girl who comes from the family that has robbed and caused his fathers fall into poverty and hopelessness.
 This movie is one of Rudys best.  He covers every emotion and nuance of expression from comedy to hopelessness with a grace and adeptness that is so natural and charming that one cannot take their eyes from his presence on the screen.
 Vilma Banky plays his love interest and they have a lovely chemistry in their scenes together.  The story is exciting and I enjoyed it immensley. I am a Rudy fan and generally like all his movies but The Eagle is one that will show his talent and appeal to a very high level and lets the viewer see for themselves what all the shouting is about.  I heartily recommend this film if you want to see Rudolph Valentino at his finest.",1227571200,3,1098,4.543147208121828

During the movie, we laughed so many times... One thing I notice about silent movies (and it's very refreshing for a slightly deaf person) is that you can talk all you want, and you won't miss anything. Me and my mom were on the edge of our seats towards the end, which rarely happens with us; I had hide my eyes when it got too grim to contemplate. Shame they don't make movies like this anymore.",1226275200,,726,4.584615384615384
943766,4,6304904126,"Silent screen legend Rudolph Valentino reached enormous heights of popularity in the 1920s before his untimely death not long after starring in ""The Eagle"", which is a terrible shame because judging by his performance in this film in particular, it is evident that Valentino was more than just a pretty face and had a lot of talent to offer.  First cast in some dubious character roles (such as in ""The Married Virgin"") Valentino was soon established in the typical Hollywood heroic and irresistably charming leading man role for whom all women swooned.  ""The Eagle"" is a good example of this role in which Valentino demonstrates not only his usual magnetism and appeal, but also humour and an overall fine feeling for details and subtle comedy.  Very much in the style of Zorro and Robin Hood made popular a few years earlier by Douglas Fairbanks Sr, ""The Eagle"" is Russia's version of this masked avenger fighting for the poor against injustices, and all in glorious Hollywood style.  Although the sets and costumes give the film a distinct Russian flavour, the story is definitely classic Hollywood entertainment all the way with tongue-in-cheek comedy, indispensable romance, standard action and adventure, and the triumph over bad in an unexpected happy ending.  The story is quite interesting and entertaining from the very onset which shows how Valentino as a Cossack guard first gets into trouble by resisting the Czarina's romantic advances, resulting in her condemnation of him as a deserter, wanted dead or alive.  At home, his dying father has been cheated by a wealthy landlord out of his entire estate, and as the peasants rally around him crying for justice, Valentino dons the Zorro-like mask and becomes known as `The Black Eagle' vowing to take revenge on the greedy landlord, but wouldn't you know it:  Valentino's love interest turns out to be the daughter of the man he is after!  This enjoyable and satisfying story is enhanced by good acting, especially by Valentino, and the picture quality is very good throughout.  The musical accompaniment is a theatre organ and is well-suited to the scenes, although I can imagine that an orchestral score playing Russian-style music would further enhance this film.  In any case, ""The Eagle"" is thoroughly entertaining in true Hollywood style and should satisfy even those who are not great Valentino fans.",1178236800,4,2369,5.066838046272494
943767,4,6304904126,"The movie is worth 5 stars and more; it's only the quality of the DVD transfer that is meriting a 4-star review.  This DVD is my only experience with this movie, since I never had a laser disc player, but hearing about how beautiful the laser disc version this very same company used to offer was, it's shameful that they put out the lackluster rendition in lieu of their far superior print.  On the one hand, we're lucky to have this on DVD when only about half of Rudy's major movies are currently available on that format (the rest are on videos that aren't sold in most major retail chains, and those videos too deserve restoration work and DVD treatment), and that most of his major movies, and even a fair amount of the movies he made before becoming famous, are still with us when so many other silent movies are lost, but considering all of that, more care should have been demanded.  It's one thing to say it's expected in a film of this age, but obviously there was a much better print available previously, a print which didn't have dust, specks, and lines speckled over it.  However, in spite of that, it's in very good condition; from having read about the condition of the print, I was expecting much worse.  This isn't a film like his earlier movie 'Moran of the Lady Letty'; a solid underrated movie which is practically unwatchable in many spots because oftentimes faces and objects are little more than blurs.  This movie has none of that; you can see everything and everyone clearly, and since it's such a good story, the background disturbances can be overlooked.  The background music of the organ is also a problem in this transfer; it's not as bad as the background music in 'Moran,' but still just doesn't seem to fit with the mood of the movie.  I  would have expected authentic Russian pieces to be played in the background, giving the movie an even more Russian feel (I'm also a longtime Russophile in addition to liking classic cinema).

In spite of the lacking transfer job, the story is still wonderful, combining drama (my favourite genre) with a lot of comic moments, like when Vladimir, while posing as Marcel, is so distracted by the presence of Masha at the supper table that he puts way too much pepper in his soup, or when the ring on his finger gets stuck and he has to pull on it for awhile before he can give it to Masha.  If there were another DVD edition put out, this time with proper music and the old laser disc print, it would be even better and more highly-recommended.",1106438400,4,2516,4.5198237885462555
943768,2,6304904126,"If you don't have a copy of Valentino's most engaging silent, ""The Eagle"", in your collection, you should certainly have this, but you should know that it is far - very far - from the best version that has been available.  This edition is sourced from the Killiam Collection, and is evidently from a 16mm reduction print that saw long use and little care.  Contrast and detail are poor, to say the least.  There is a sad, tired musical accompaniment that is best turned off, frankly.
What's awful about all this is that this same company, Image Entertainment, once offered a far superior version.  Its 1989 laserdisc edition was based on a clean 35mm print from the Rohauer Collection that had excellent contrast and detail.  The score was a magnificently well-suited one by Carl Davis; it went so well with the film that once you've had a viewing with Davis's compositions, seeing ""The Eagle"" with any other score is unthinkable.
""The Eagle"" is indispensable to a collection of silents, but this edition is not a patch on what Image itself has offered in the past. It is to be hoped that the company can clear whatever obstacles are keeping it from offering a DVD release of what was one of the best silent-film offerings on laserdisc.
Two stars out of five- I'm docking two for the ghastly print, two for the wretched score that takes the place of Davis's work, and adding one back to be charitable, because this movie is one of Valentino's best, and you should have it, even in a version as shabby as this.",1040774400,34,1509,4.615671641791045

They put new.music in and it feels more appropriate. Love Valentino, love The Eagle.",1490227200,,252,4.622222222222222

7880044,5,6304904126,The video quality isn't great but the NEW music score on this version is one of the best I have ever heard on a silent film. The music flows almost seamlessly with the film to tell the story that is so well acted without hearing spoken words. There are two streaming videos of this movie on Amazon and they have different music scores. The other has the original organ music score.,1459987200,,381,4.380281690140845
7880045,4,6304904126,"The was one of the last Valentino films and it is one of his best. The Amazon Streaming version is good in quality and I did not encounter any problems. The musical soundtrack features great music. However, there are a total of about 3 songs and they are played over and over again. Some of them do not quite match the mood of the scene. This became irritating about halfway through. Vilma Banky provides good chemistry and Louise Dresser is memorable as the Czarina.",1433462400,,467,4.571428571428571

7880047,3,6304904126,"The movie itself, and Rudy's acting, were good.  The print, however, lacked detail, like it had been dubbed too many times, maybe it was the best available. The background music was good, orchestrated, but spoiled by being played by a synthesizer. When I watch a vintage movie, I would like to hear authentic background music, piano, organ, or small orchestra, and not something that obviously comes through an electronic instrument that wasn't invented until decades later. With a film of this historic import, don't you think they could have spared a few dollars more and hired real musicians?",1390089600,3,595,5.071428571428571
