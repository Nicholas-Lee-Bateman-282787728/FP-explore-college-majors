8257446,2,B00153ZQQY,"Had no idea the story was mainly a musical.  Considering the timeframe of when it was distributed, I guess it makes sense.  The story was drab and didn't keep anyone's attention very well.",1358467200,,188,4.666666666666667

8257451,3,B00153ZQQY,"I have not yet viewed this movie, however, I felt it needed a product description so you would know what the movie is about. I gave it three stars because I had to rate it in order to submit this review. I remind you that I have not yet seen it. It looks good though and I probably will get it. I just hope the product info helps.

Plot Summary for
Monster Mash (2000) (V) More at IMDbPro 

As the story unfolds, we meet the three main monsters: Frank, the monster from Frankenstein; Drac, the vampire, and Wolf, the werewolf. They were once the scariest of monsters, but now they have become associated with ""fun."" That's why they have been called before the Court of Horrors. They must prove that they can still be scary, and if they fail they will be sentenced to an eternity of entertaining at children's parties. They are given 24 hours to terrify the Tinklemeister family, but what should be a no-brainer turns out to be a nightmare. Mom and Dad Tinklemeister are easy to scare, but Stella and Spike, the Tinklemeister children, are another story altogether. The monster trio becomes frustrated and finally lets the family in on their dilemma. The Tinklemeisters understand and help them try to gain back their scary status. Just when it looks like the threesome will win their case, three new modern monsters show up to foil their plan. It's Stella and Spike to the rescue. Written by Alex Schultz <NedSDeclassified2967>

Not a fan of the Frankenstein monster in this one (check out the front cover with him wearing that UGLY half shirt...YUCK!) I thought it was very interesting that they kind of combined Jason from the Friday the 13th movies and Freddy Krueger from the Nightmare franchise into one ""bad guy"" monster! And CHICKY well i think you know who she is a spoof of! Dont know what im talking about? Check out this dvd, perfect for the child who isn't quite ready for the R rated horror movies and cant sit through the classic Universal Monster ones!!",1264291200,3,705,4.739837398373984
