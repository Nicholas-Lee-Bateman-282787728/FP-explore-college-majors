3961459,5,B002OHYR9C,"I loved this show when I found it late one night years ago. The interplay between the two leads brought a quirky show alive and so dynamic I kept looking for the next episode. The sexual tension and story line flow was like real life, going where events happened and not in an apparent pre-packaged 'themed' direction. A quality TV product packaged at a poor time slot, it made me appreciate a good recorder. IN AUstralia, it was another fill in show for the network that did not understand its appeal.",1328745600,,502,4.527472527472527
3961460,5,B002OHYR9C,"Firstly, it is NOT worth it to buy the UK version if you don't have a region-free player. Neither my laptop nor my DVD player would read the disks, so I resorted to a MUCH more expensive solution. I'm hanged if I can find out who can distribute this in region 1 format. For those who have not seen the series, it is an energetic - car chase/fight scene/shoot 'em up/explosion fest with a little romance kept simmering by the heat Michael Brandon (Dempsey) brings. It became apparent very shortly into the series, that Brandon was contributing fresh dialogue to the scripts. AND there was even more to it than that. In a nutshell, the producers/writers really didn't have too tight of a grip on character development... or even mild production concerns like not almost killing your principal cast in a car crusher. ""Surely they didn't put ACTORS in a car crusher with the machine in operation?"", you snort. YOU were foolishly thinking the producers had the sense that God gave a sheepdog.
Aside from the bad-taste-even-for-the-80s costuming choices for the Makepeace character, (which gets fixed in S3) everything holds up brilliantly. Glynis looks like a million bucks in all the special features. Hey! The soda cans all have pull-tabs in this show! This 3-series box set includes all of the episodes, plus the 2-hour pilot (Armed and Extremely Dangerous). Each season has some kind of special feature on the first disk of the set. Charmingly, the DVD uses the re-join that you would have seen on TV going out to and coming back in from breaks(theme music over title card). Not the cleanest print in the world used to make these DVDs. As far as ""where are they now"" I could easily see Mr. and Mrs. Brandon doing recurring characters over at Fox TV U.S. where they seem to only cast Brits and Canadians. I hope someone snaps out of it (Wharmby, you reading this?)and capitalizes on their great, and under-utilized talent.",1281225600,9,1920,4.768768768768769
3961461,5,B002OHYR9C,"I would love to see this in a US format as well, which is why I checked it out -- to see if there was a US version yet. It did show in the US for all 3 seasons, didn't it? I loved the chemistry between the two, and I would have bought it right now if it was available!",1268092800,15,268,3.4833333333333334
3961462,5,B002OHYR9C,"I remember this show with great affection; it was, as the other reviewer said, quirky and fast-paced. The sexual tension between Dempsey and Makepeace was palpable as well, and is still ongoing, as evidenced by the fact that Michael Brandon and Glynis Barber got married soon after the run of the show and are still together.

It's got everything anyone could want in a cop show, plus a large splash of humor based on the culture clash between the NYC cop and the oh-so-proper Brit.

I'd love to be able to see it again, which means someone has to release it in a format that plays in the U.S. So... who do I write/call to ask for this on compatible DVD? I know at least two other people who would buy it immediately if it were available!",1263945600,21,738,4.37956204379562
3961463,5,B002OHYR9C,"I discovered this quirky British cop show back in the early 80s while channel surfig and loved it. Good action, good looking people, irreverant attitudes, sort of like Starsky and Hutch.

I'd LOVE to see this show released in a format for the USA.",1258502400,3,247,4.613636363636363
8376014,5,B002OHYR9C,"One of my favorite cop shows of all time. I never missed an episode but it never ran in reruns so I had not seen it since original airing. I had
to add to my collection and since it's not released in the US I had to get the UK dvds! I have the 3 single seasons not this complete series!
But the shows seem to be uncut and the picture quality is very good. This is a great TV cop show from UK with plenty of action and violence
and humor like many american cop shows from 70's and 80's! The stories are well written and acted great! The plot of an american cop who
gets stuck in the middle of corruption and scandal is sent packing to UK to work with cops and ends up with a female partner! of course there
are sparks right from the start and they don't like each other but of course later on they develop a chemistry and make a great team. The
show is a fast paced exciting TV series filmed in UK and is one of the better UK cops shows ever made. A must have for cop show fans!",1489968000,,977,3.89
8376015,5,B002OHYR9C,"Great series vended by a caring supplier. This is a region 2 set and the vendor was careful to be sure that I could play them before shipping. This is probably the best video quality available... not blu-ray, but eminently watchable.",1439424000,,233,4.7073170731707314

8376017,5,B002OHYR9C,"I had been waiting for this series to come out in DVD for many years.  I got the Region 2 version and appreciate the series even more now than I had the first time.  The chemistry between Brandon and Barber is obvious from the first scenes (even though the second episode was shot before the pilot), and Ray Smith is great as Chief Supt. Spikings, Dempsey's gruff boss and nemesis.  The ending to the series is very fitting and satisfying, not like the awful endings of some other series.  It also has some interesting special features.  Thanks for finally releasing this great series, and it would be great if it could be released to Region 1.",1421280000,,644,4.517241379310345

8376019,5,B002OHYR9C,"Loved this series when it was on in Canada many years ago.  I've always wanted it but it's never been available in a format that would play in North America.  As I was going to have some down time because of health issues I decided that I'd get a DVD player that could play any format and happily ordered Dempsey & Makepeace.  The seller was very good, he contacted me before shipping to be sure that I knew the set was PAL not my region. I assured him I was setup for it and it was a go.  The set arrived very quickly and all the DVDs play well.  There is some 'noise' but not much, that could be my player not the DVDs.  The 'noise' didn't distract me from enjoying every minute of the shows.  If you're a fan, and even if you're not, it's definitely worth buying, and if you have to, pick up an inexpensive All Region DVD player.  I got mine through Amazon.",1393113600,,860,4.107784431137724
8376020,5,B002OHYR9C,I watched this when it was put on the air waves. it was great to find it again so I could enjoy it again and again.,1371772800,,115,3.4615384615384617
8376021,5,B002OHYR9C,"Release Dempsey and Makepeace in the U.S. With all the reality show garbage on TV, I would prefer to watch this show from the 1980s. It was much more exciting than most of the nonsense on TV today.",1343174400,4,197,4.2105263157894735
8376022,4,B002OHYR9C,"Fonzies girlfriend's sister leather tuscedero is here.

Suzi Quatro the first lady of Rock n Roll who has sold millions of records worldwide, who also did a stint in happy days as leather tuscedero, now plays a murderous obsessed woman after the love of James Dempsey.

The episode love you to death shows Suzi in a new light, instead of pumping out hits on the world stage she is shown here as a murderous villian who wants James Dempsey's love anyway she can get it. Even if it means by killing.

Great acting here and a good night in. Well spent.",1338508800,,549,4.415841584158416
8376023,5,B002OHYR9C,"It is a real pleasure to have this serie. A lot of action , a lut of humor , a lot of sentiments and love , an of course , all in the old good fashion way of the BBC style. I recomad this tv series to all the people that love to see a real british quality , in the most pure way. The DVD""s themselfs are in good condition , regarding a ""80 movie , but do not try to use 16:9 screen , only 4:3. It will be a real pleaure",1334016000,,419,3.4680851063829787
