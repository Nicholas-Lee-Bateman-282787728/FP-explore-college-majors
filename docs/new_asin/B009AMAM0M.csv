5300830,1,B009AMAM0M,Awful. Nickelodeon really is getting to the point of making only garbage. If you want a movie to watch with the family I suggest looking elsewhere.,1361664000,4,147,4.6923076923076925
5300831,1,B009AMAM0M,"The movie do not accomplish the goal to be a whole entertainment film. It trays, but is not enough. Only a little of really fun size.",1361664000,,133,4.153846153846154
5300832,3,B009AMAM0M,"Going into this movie it's pretty clear the writers stole the scripts to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Adventures-In-Babysitting/dp/B004IF8TLU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Adventures In Babysitting</a>&nbsp;and the second half of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Role-Models/dp/B0027C7JIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Role Models</a>&nbsp;(maybe a few more) in hopes of coming up with just enough new, witty tidbits to freshen the smell.  Surprisingly, the efforts didn't completely fail.

Wren (Victoria Justice) is a pretty, popular senior in High School, and she's about to attend the party of the year where the BMOC will profess his love to her through horrible, faux-sensitive Indy music.  Her trampy mother Joy (Chelsea Handler - casted perfectly), who has her own party to attend, screws everything up when she forgoes the responsibilities of adulthood and forces Wren to act as a mother-figure to her own chubby, trouble-making, potentially mute, probable future serial-killer brother, Albert.  Stuck babysitting her brother, Wren loses track of the pint-sized criminal and then links up with her best friend, a guy playing the quintessential nerdy crush, and a fourth wheel to find the little hell-raiser.  Somewhere in there is Johnny Knoxville as the bad guy, some fowl-automobile love, and the eventual end of script realizations.

Most of the contents are recycled and disposable, but it's still somewhat entertaining.  It's far better than many other movies I've seen.  The connection to Nickelodeon hurt, but it's far edgier - crude jokes, current slang, pop culture references - than expected.  That unfortunate dichotomy is what ties this movie's hands.  It doesn't placate either the young, impressionable minds or the old, perverted minds.  It stays in a purgatory between Hannah Montana and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jonah-Hill/dp/B0010R08PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jonah Hill</a>, and never really connects with either audience.

The feeling I get from this movie reminds me of trick-or-treating as a kid, going to a door, seeing someone graciously drop candy into my bag, and then realizing it's that nasty candy corn.  It's nice to get candy, but I could live without it.  As an easily distracted grown man with a juvenile sense of humor, I admit to being close to the target audience.  And even I can't give this movie more than 3 stars.",1352937600,8,2497,6.155619596541786
5300833,4,B009AMAM0M,"I thought this movie was pretty good, and had the Halloween spirit. It seemed very risque and sexy for a Nickelodeon movie. Victoria Justice stars as Wren, a teenage girl hoping to get into a popular boy's Halloween party, but instead she must take her annoying little brother, Albert, trick or treating. While going through a haunted house, Wren loses Albert and spends the rest of the night looking for him. She requires the help of her sexy redhead friend, April, and two nerds named Roosevelt and Peng. Throughout the night, they get into wild and crazy shenanigans looking for Albert. If you want a fun light-hearted feel good Halloween movie, you'll love FUN SIZE!!!",1351641600,7,672,4.852173913043479
5300834,4,B009AMAM0M,"""Fun Size"" (2012 release; 90 min.) is a PG-13 rated Nickelodeon movie which brings the story of Wren (played by Nickelodeon TV star Victoria Justice) who lives in suburban Cleveland and is getting ready for what she hopes will be a great party at the house of Aaron, on whom she has a secret crush. A problem arises when Wren's mom (played by stand-up comedian Chelsea Handler) informs her that she is going out herself, and as a result Wren is tasked with watching over her 8 yr. brother Albert. Wren and her best friend April go out for a walk on Halloween, along with little Albert. Soon enough, though, they lose track of Albert and they now need to do whatever they can do to find Albert before Wren's mom comes back home. Wren and April sweet-talk two guys, Roosevelt and Peng, to give them a ride to look for Albert. I will leave it at that, as to give more away from the plot would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: fist and foremost, this is a sweet little movie that strikes a great balance between pranks and teenage romance. Second, even though Victoria Justice is well known for her roles on Nickelodeon TV, this is her first headlining role in a major movie, and she is utterly charming. Third, the movie is set in Cleveland, and the producers really make it look very nice, with panoramic shots of downtown but also the Lakewood and Cleveland Heights neighborhoods. Fourth, I thought that Chelsea Handler was badly miscast as Wren's mom, for one thing she looks more like she could be Wren's sister, not her mom. Fifth, there is also a decent enough soundtrack, featuring songs from Passion Pitt, the Magic Wand and others.

Last but not least, the movie is rated PG-13 for a reason. At the movie showing I attended today, incredibly there were several parents who came to see this with kids who had to be 5-6 yrs. old AT MOST. To no-one's surpise, these little kids were utterly bored by this movie and became restless not even 10 min. into it. Wow, just wow. All that aside, ""Fun Size"" is a nice little Halloween teen comedy, nothing more, nothing less.",1351296000,3,2144,4.537467700258398
5300835,5,B009AMAM0M,"I think Fun Size was one of the most highly original and super-smart movies that I have ever seen not just this year, but in the past 20 years...easily! While you will be forgiven for misjudging Fun Size as being just another derivative teen comedy--it has a cast of young people, Victoria Justice (did I mention she turned 18 nearly two years ago???!) and the guy from The O.C. and Gossip Girls directing--it is so much more profound than that. It is so profound that it handily makes the previous standard bearer for the most highly sophisticated teen comedy, Porky's, look like an absolute piece of s--- by comparison!

The undoubted strength of Fun Size comes from its exceptionally innovative and revolutionary plot that, at least to my mind, has never, ever been tried before in a movie in this genre--or any genre!! It stars Victoria Justice (she turned 18 about two years ago, by the way) of that unchallenging Victorious TV show as Wren, a girl who is delighted to find out that she's been invited to a Halloween sex party by her wannabe eff buddy, Aaron. Throwing a massive monkey wrench into this otherwise innocent and family friendly plotline is the insistence of her mom (played by that very funny comedienne called Chelsea Handler who, by comparison, makes Paula Poundstone look like the funniest woman on Earth) that she take along her little brother named Albert. The running gag in this highly tasteful movie is that Albert is a r/e/t/a/r/d who ""suffers"" from autism, which was such a hilarious hook that I was hardly able to contain my laughter at the punch line of the r/e/t/a/r/d/e/d kid!! Of course, a part of me shuddered at this small hint of insensitivity toward the larger r/e/t/a/r/d community in the world, because I have decent morals, after all, yet I soon discovered that the director of this movie wanted r/e/t/a/r/d/s to be the b/u/t/t of his unambitious movie so I laughed along merrily.

As the movie goes on, Albert the autistic kid eventually gets lost on Halloween...while wearing a Barack Obama mask...in South Central LA! I know! Even more hilarious hilarity ensues, pardner! The rest of the movie somewhat cruelly continues to make fun of Albert's r/e/t/a/r/d/e/d autism tendencies, which includes awkward scenes involving his inability to talk to other people smoothly, his penchant for wetting his pants, and his being possessed by several demons at a time. Wren and her crush, Aaron, eventually steal a car and engage in misadventures that are not at all clichd or directly stolen from 80s teen movies.

On the whole, I think Fun Size is definitely worth your precious time and money, but you will require a lot of patience in order to sit through its excessive helpings of originality, awesomeness and sophisticated intelligence. At first, I thought that making fun of Victoria Justice's r/e/t/a/r/d/e/d kid brother was a little bit close to not that nice, yet I quickly decided that making fun of mentally deficient folks was a surefire and very classy way to get laughs! Lastly, did I mention yet that Victoria Justice turned 18 almost two years ago already?!?!? Yummay.",1351209600,7,3117,4.888468809073724

5301604,5,B009AMAM0M,"Sometimes, I get the urge to watch a movie that I'm pretty sure isn't going to be good...something that I'd normally have no interest in. To get more into the Halloween spirit last month, I tried watching some Halloween-related movies, old and new. Fun Size is one that I heard about during a movie review show, where both critics were on completely different sides, with one saying that it was pretty good, and the other saying it's downright terrible. Well, you can see what I thought of it already just based on the 5 star rating, but Fun Size is surprisingly fun, and got a couple of small laughs out of me. At the same time, it's a very weird movie- this is the kind of thing you'd expect to see from the 80s with a bunch of college-age kids running around on a crazy adventure...but it's using younger actors in the same setting and situations. I only knew a little bit about Fun Size being ""controversial"" going into it, and as soon as a little kid uttered a certain `b word', I got it. It may be a Nickelodeon movie, it may have Victoria Justice, but Fun Size is still a movie for teens, and they didn't pull any punches.

Wren is your average teen girl getting ready for a big Halloween party with her friends. The party just happens to be at the home of a guy she has a big crush on. Things don't go as planned when her mom, Joy, leaves Wren in charge of watching her little brother, Albert, while Joy goes off to her much younger boyfriend's own Halloween party. Albert hasn't spoke in a long time, and tends to do whatever he wants, though it's usually relatively harmless things like using the toilet while Wren's in the shower, cutting up clothes to make toys, and more. Things get much worse when Albert ditches Wren and her friends while trick-or-treating, going off on his own adventure while they scramble all over the city to find him. At the same time, Joy is finding out that dating a much younger man may not be so great when she sees just how out of place she is at a party full of people in their mid-20s. Meanwhile, Albert encounters some pretty zany people, managing to get by without saying a word.

Yes, it sounds pretty stupid. Yes, it's essentially a new take on Adventures in Babysitting. But you know what? Fun Size is a lot better than it has any right to be. It's not going to make my top 100 favorite movies list by any means, although I sure wouldn't mind watching it a few more times over the next year, especially for next Halloween. Crazy situations aside, Wren manages to be a likable character, is genuinely concerned about her little brother, and does what she can to go find him. The poor girl is always just one step behind the little guy, kind of like the events in An American Tail. The one who steals the show is Albert, who was also featured in another movie I saw recently, Bad Grandpa. As soon as he picked out his costume (one-armed Spider-Man), I knew this kid was going to have some great moments. He befriends a mini-mart worker named Fuzzy, who is down on his luck after being dumped by his girlfriend, and takes Albert along to go on a little revenge mission. Fuzzy makes note of how weird it is that he's going out with such a young kid, and announces several times that he's not doing anything weird. It may not big that big of a storyline, but I really liked how Joy goes from cool single mom with a young boyfriend to ""what the heck am I doing here?"" as soon as she enters the party. Anyone who's been in a relationship with someone a bit older than them might know how weird it is to see someone of a certain age trying to dress or act a certain way when it's more uncomfortable than anything else, whether they're aware of it or not.

As for the movie supposedly being controversial, it's exactly like what I said earlier. This is the kind of thing you'd see in the 80s, just with younger actors. There's some mild language, a few sexual references (nothing big at all, aside from a big chicken) and that's about it. Very little violence, no gore and what language there is, isn't anything that kids who will be watching this movie haven't heard before. It's pretty sad that a lot of the negative reviews for Fun Size are from parents who were shocked by a couple of words. I wonder how these parents would react to any random episode of Ren & Stimpy. If there's anything I didn't like about the movie, it's Wren's best friend who is obsessed with being seen as cool by other people, and even ditches a big responsibility at one point in order to do what she wants. Why is Wren, a smart and responsible girl, friends with her?

Fun Size lives up to its name. It's a fun, short Halloween movie that's more for teens, but I sure enjoyed it a lot. It does feel a bit made-for-tv at times, but this one came out of nowhere and put me in a good mood. It's certainly a big step up from a lot of other Halloween movies I saw over the last month. Give it a shot.",1415404800,2,4916,4.317099567099567

The film has many cute scenes. There is also potty humor. Innuendos and big chickens that explains where car hybrids come from. They threw in an asthmatic cat is a good addition to the mix.

5302512,2,B009AMAM0M,I thought the over all movie was descent for a Older Teenager BUT Should have more of a higher rating than PG13.. My daughter loved the show Victorious so I thought this movie would be kid friendly like the show....WRONG.. It is definitely not..I put it on for her and then when I walked back into her room to check on her I walked in on some very foul language!! So I turned it off..,1389225600,5,384,4.133333333333334

5302518,5,B009AMAM0M,I was looking for something funny and new on Netflix and I found fun size. As soon as it started I loved it I watched it about 8 more times after that I knew I had to buy it on dvd. I've seen a lot of bad reviews on Netflix and amazon and I think so parents thought just because it was nickelodeon they thought there younger kids could watch it. Honestly I think this is more for older kids. I thought the characters were real teenagers nothing like the fake well behaved high school musical ones and the humor was more teenage appropriate. I recommend this to all of my friends  and any other teenagers if they want a good laugher but I honestly don't think its for most younger kids.,1388793600,5,685,4.1893939393939394

5302742,2,B009AMAM0M,Pay attention to the rating.  I bought this movie to show to my 6th grade students as a Halloween treat.  Bad move on my part that I didn't watch the movie first. There are a couple of scenes that I didn't feel were appropriate for my students.  I stopped the movie before it was completed.  The movie is entertaining and OK to show at home to your family.  I am a bit dissappointed with Nickelodeon.,1387670400,,400,4.28
5302743,4,B009AMAM0M,This was a cute movie. My daughter and I watched it together and enjoyed it. This will be one we watch again.,1387238400,,109,4.0

5302791,2,B009AMAM0M,As an adult I watched it because it sounded cute and with the girl from the show on Nick being in such a crude humored movie I was disappointed by far. I know it was 13 and over but it was crude with sex comments and gestures through the whole movie and this little boy is running with strangers like it is okay. Don't get me started on the political pushing of Obama and other left wing things. There was no need for the political indoctrination added into the movie. So if you are a parent concerned with those issues I would suggest watching it first. I really cannot believe this passes as okay in the teen world. No wonder kids are turning out so crazy anymore. I gave it two stars as at least it was not a total loss but a waste of time.,1385164800,2,743,4.095890410958904

5302793,2,B009AMAM0M,This movie was much more crude than what I would have expected for a PG rating and considering it's a Nickelodeon-produced movie.

5302797,1,B009AMAM0M,"My 10 yr old wanted this movie since it had Victoria Justice in it. Just terrible- full of sexual situations (plenty of crotch scenes and a chicken that ""violates"" a car), disrespecting parents and stealing, drinking scenes, jokes about peeing and pooping and references to drug use. I think the point was that the family was disfunctional after the death of the dad, but it takes it too far with a cougar mom played by Chelsea Handler, a little boy that is neglected and withdrawn from the world and a nerdy teen that tries to hold it all together. You don't even like the main character (Justice) because she's downright mean to her brother, describing him as ""fat"" and not really caring much about him until she loses him. Maybe a 14 yr would enjoy this movie (if they liked crude humor) but Nickelodeon's casting of Justice makes much younger girls want to see it and I'm sure Nickelodeon knew that.",1379635200,4,903,4.614906832298137

Take my word for it, if you are looking for an any-time-of-year Halloween laugh fest, don't miss Fun Size. The cast is totally cute and funny (I ADORE Chelsea Handler), the costumes made me want to throw a party RIGHT NOW, and every single scene has lots to laugh at.

5302832,3,B009AMAM0M,Maybe it was my fault thinking since Victorious was in a funny teen tv show that this would be a funny teen movie and it wasn't.  It was instead one of the weirdest movies I've watched and can say glad I didn't spend my money at the theaters for this one.  Was disappointed in the story which is too bad since I like Victoria.,1376006400,,326,4.078125

There were definitely some parts were we all laughed quite a bit....especially the beginning with the little brother. Other parts were kind of slow, but for the most part I enjoyed it and so did the 12 year olds. Definitely a family night rental, but it does have some more adult themed content, so wouldn't suggest for much younger than the rating.",1373241600,,626,4.405172413793103

She meets up with a nerdy boy who loves her. The hot guy at school knows who she is even though they only have homeroom. It does seem like they have spoke much. Yeah, it is Sixteen Candles with a Halloween theme. Something different is Roosevelt the nerdy boy has two mothers. Their scenes are funny. The little brother does some funny thing.

5302923,3,B009AMAM0M,Even though I gave this movie 3 stars I did however find it funny. the reason I gave it 3 stars is because it has a lot of foul language and a lot of drinking. and even a sexual scene. I think nickoloden went over the line with the sexual scene. if you are not sure what part i'm talking about is that the part where the chicken is humping the car that was not funny at all and when one of the boys touched one of the girls breasts. I thought nickelodeon was supposed to be a kids network. I have seen other nick movies and they were ok. I don't know what made them say ok to that. and on the cover box it says a family film. since when did I see a family film that envolves that kind of crap. if it was made by any other company outside Disney I wouldn't be shocked. i'm not going to lie I did like the film but I just want nick to know that they went a little to far. one foul word would of been ok but leave out the sexual and drinking stuff out you are sending the wrong message to teenage girls that that is ok to do. which is not. kids today reflect on tv to much. this is not a movie for kids under the age of sixteen. even 13 is still to young. well all in all I personally thought that it was good. just don't let your youngsters watch it espicialy if they are under 16. if you have not seen this movie I recommend adults and kids the age of sixteen to see this movie,1369699200,3,1376,3.831578947368421

5303163,5,B009AMAM0M,Funny funny movie I loved it ! We ordered it thru our Roku and it was instantly on our tv to watch. My children and I watched it and loved it.,1362873600,,142,3.6129032258064515
5303164,1,B009AMAM0M,"Rented this movie to watch with my children thinking that nickelodeon would make something decent, and that was my first big mistake since we don't even watch nickelodeon ever!

This movie theaches children everything opposite regarding personal safety to children that any parent with 1/2 brain would teach them.

This movie teaches no moral values in any way:  Single, mature moms dating college kids, girls allowing strangers touch them inappropiately, wild parties...

This movie is disgusting and whoever put money to make it should feel embarrased, I hope, because I feel embarrased to have watched it.

DO NOT RENT IT.  DO NOT BUY IT!! I wish I would've read reviews before I got it from Redbox, which by the way seems to have the worst movie selection anyone could ever imagine.",1362787200,7,786,4.961832061068702

5303167,3,B009AMAM0M,"When Nickelodeon Studios joined in they gutted most of the humor in an attempt to appeal to a younger crowd.  The result is a motion picture that cannot decide to whom it should be targeted.  Had it gone all in on the kiddy stuff or the teen sex comedy stuff it would have been a better flick.  Instead, it wavers on the fence and the whole film suffers for it.
Victoria Justice and Jane Levy are remarkably attractive, so they will be fine.  Rikki Lindhome shines in a few scenes as a Galaxy Scout.",1362700800,,499,4.276595744680851
5303168,2,B009AMAM0M,"Fun size looks like a cool movie on the trailor. But really, when you watch it, it's just about a sister looking for her brother. Not that great but it's funny in some parts",1362614400,,173,4.117647058823529

5303261,3,B009AMAM0M,Some parts were kind of funny but I expected more humour.  It's good to watch one time but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at theaters,1362441600,,134,3.7857142857142856

5303263,4,B009AMAM0M,"I have paid to view this movie 2 separate times now so I might as well buy it. It's nothing spectacular imo however, my 5 yo daughter loves it and has watched it 6x during the 2 paid for viewing days. She normally doesnt set through an entire movie (not even Disney ones) but she is mesmerized by this one.",1362096000,,306,4.116666666666666

5303265,2,B009AMAM0M,I was shocked that a nick movie was so crass. movies like this are why you must monitor what your kids watch. it has suggestive language and scenes. there was foul language where it really wasn't necessary. my mom would not let me watch something like this when I was kid. I won't be watching it again.,1361836800,7,302,4.315789473684211

but if you think that these are funny, then perhaps it is a movie for you.
giant chicken statue falls off roof & onto the back of a car where it's bobbing motion mimics humping.
teen girl promises teen boy he can put his hand on her breast for 20 seconds if he does what she wants.
lost 8 year old hangs out with random 20 something guy & they do mean things to people .
lost 8 year old parties in an adult club with woman dressed as sexy anime character

Should have known better seeing that beat-up looking and unfunny old Chelsea Handler was in it.  As gauche as it gets.  Nickelodeon has never been synonymous with quality programming, but this is just crude low-brow garbage.  Keep your kids away.",1485561600,,389,5.4
