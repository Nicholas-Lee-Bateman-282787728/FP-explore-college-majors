8324044,1,B000BPL2J2,"With enough silicon on view to refurbish a fair size beach, this video reminds me of some of the old Bert Rhine videos from 20 years ago which promised a lot and delivered little (except for the MC who liked to run his mouth!).  There is literally no full frontal nudity, and the girls are about average with a few porkers thrown in for good measure.

The action keeps jumping from place to place (discos, street scenes, stages in strip clubs, etc.) such that the viewer gets no sense of continuity and does not have any time to focus on any one girl.  Even the Girls Gone Wild videos from some years ago, as bad as they were, at least gave the viewer a little more time to enjoy the better looking girls.

I first ran across this POS in an After Hours Cinema catalog of Grindhouse Vintage Erotica videos and was intrigued by the description.  To say the least, I was totally misled - this video has nothing to do with ""Grindhouse"", it is definitely not ""vintage"", and calling it ""erotica"" is really stretching a point.

So go find yourself an alligator to pet rather than wasting money on this video.  Trying to pet the gator will not cost you anything (unless your are careless) and I guarantee you will derive much more excitement.",1300320000,,1234,4.457777777777777
