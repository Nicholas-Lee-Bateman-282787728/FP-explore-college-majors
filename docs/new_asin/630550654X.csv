7893021,3,630550654X,"Peter Mcallister(Lee Gavin) who is an aging yet powerful ninja who lived in Japan for nearly 30 years and conquered the art of ninjitsu, he finds out that he has a daughter and goes back to the USA as he is marked for death including his daughter. A drifter named Max Keller (Timothy Van Patton) finds himself teaming up with Peter as they help up with a beautiful girl (Demi Moore) and her father (Claude Atkins) to save the private airport from a greedy businessman (Clu Gulager) as another Ninja is trying to assassinate Peter.

Basically 2 episodes combined in one movie, this show was short lived as it had only 13 episodes and aired on NBC back in 1984. This was notable for one of Demi Moore's first appearences and this was a cash-in on the success of ""The A-Team"" and ""Kung Fu"" only using Karate instead of Kung Fu, the action sequences are quite good and the acting is kind of lame but i should say this does have a nice cast of actors. MST3K did this collection with part 2 shown, funny to see the guys riffing on this one but it's not too bad actually and rather enjoyable.",1312761600,,1085,4.371287128712871

7893023,3,630550654X,"This movie is about a white older guy that has been trained in the secret arts of the ninja.  He came to america after thirty years in Japan to find the daughter he never knew he had.  He teams up with a young boy who tries  to do right and always ends up in trouble everywhere he travels.  This  story is about the young boy meeting up with Demi Moore in a town where the  sheriff is bad and is trying to make Demi and her father sell their land so  the sheriff and some other rich guys can build a shopping mall.  Well the  boy and his friend the ""master ninja"" end up getting envolved and  all kinds of caos happens including the master using his ninja skills to  stop the criminals from hurting the young Demi Moore.  This is a very  exciting movie!!  Lots of fun and has some comedy in it with the ninja  techniques.  I rented it to see Sho Kosugi, but he is only in it as a bad  guy who is stalking the master ninja and trying to kill him for leaving  Japan.  If your watching this to see Sho Kosugi the ninja he is not in it  very much at all.  But if you like ninja movie check it out it is really  good, and the master takes on a new student the trouble maker boy!!!",931392000,13,1175,3.9527896995708156
