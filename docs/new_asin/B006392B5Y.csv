If your partner REFUSES to read up on parenting books and articles, this 30-minute video is WORTH the low price to succinctly brief him/her on modern parenting techniques withOUT harsh punishment or time-outs.  Lets face it-- Most of us would rather sit thru a short video rather than read a long book.

Yes, its only 30 minutes  the other 30 minutes is more of a Q&A/troubleshooting section thats optional youll glean the basics from the first half.

The techniques (speaking toddler-ese, fast food rule, etc) are made to be memorable so youll easily recall how to react to tantrums in a calm way that psychologically validates the toddlers needs while keeping you in control.

So does it work? It definitely is an effective TOOL that works to REDUCE the onset and severity of tantrums; its not a cure. Of course you have to use it and soon it will become second nature; my husband used it on a toddler tantrum and he was surprised that it worked he was a reluctant skeptic at first, but upon seeing the effects he uses the tricks all the time.

My goal was to divert my husband from using strict no parenting and time outs; he didn't know any other methods and refused to read books. Thus, this video was so effective in introducing him to other methods without making me look like the know-it-all.

The only negative is that the video is terribly outdated (seems early 90s) and basic production quality; its in badly need of an update. However this does not detract from the valuable information that Dr. Karp provides.",1533340800,,1546,4.637362637362638
