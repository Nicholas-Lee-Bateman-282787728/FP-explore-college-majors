8125034,1,B000FOPPYW,"Indican has released a rather low quality transfer on this DVD which is inexcusable for a 2004 movie. Unfortunately they have also released it as a 1.85 letterboxed ratio so you either have to watch a poor transfer with black bars on all sides or use the zoom and watch a horrible picture on the bigscreen. There is more grain on your screen than the desert!

Also the actual run time is about 88 minutes, not the 92 minutes advertised by Amazon and on the casing.

Asking $24 and even selling it at $12 special is over priced.

I give it 1 star.",1428019200,,546,4.281553398058253

This movie is a must-see! It has such an important message ... Something that every one should know and try to stop it!
In the name of Allah and prophet Muhammad they are committing a crime!
There is no where in Islam(Muslim's religion) or Quran (Islam's Holy book) where this is written. Prophet never ever said you need to purify a woman!  It is only a brutal Bedouin ritual! Stop this crime now! 130,000,000 women in the world is not something you can ignore!!! 8000 per day!!! How can they! Stop these villains!",1199232000,5,548,4.591836734693878
8125036,1,B000FOPPYW,"You know a film is going to be iffy at best when one of the quotes on the cover of the dvd exclaims ""...A fairly well-made film, reasonably directed by Eran and it is a plea for women's rights..."" Not exactly a rave review-  and yet that is one of the best quotes that they could find?  The acting is terrible and the story is loosely strung together. This plays like a b movie from the 70's.  It's too bad because films from this region can be truly fascinating and give us a safe window into a volatile region. Is female castration horrible?  Of course it is.  But this is more like a bad latin soap opera with affected actors than a serious vehicle for womens rights.  No offense to the latin soaps- at least they're fun to watch.  Watching women being castrated and screaming in the middle of a weak storyline is not provocative filmmaking.",1183507200,4,844,4.371794871794871
