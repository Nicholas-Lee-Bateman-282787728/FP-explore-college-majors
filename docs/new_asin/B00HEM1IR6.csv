8631947,5,B00HEM1IR6,"I gave this 5 stars in order to counter-balance the ridiculously unfair and close-minded 1 star ratings. My actual rating is closer to 4 stars. Tin Can Man is a well-acted, character-driven horror film that follows a man on his journey into a personal night of hell. Filmed in black and white, the film has a nightmarish, claustrophobic atmosphere, bordering on dream-like; yet takes place somewhere like the real world. The choices made in the dialogue, art design, and lighting are all deliberate and indicate a high level of attention to detail and knowledge of craft. If you're the type of person open to horror films that break the tired conventions then give this one a try.",1486252800,,680,4.82051282051282
8631948,1,B00HEM1IR6,"Pete (Patrick O'Donnell) is having a bad day. He is not only dumped by his girlfriend but she tells me her other boyfriend is a better lover. His boss says he needs to put in more hours- unpaid. Pete desires to be an actor. Then a man comes to his apartment and strong arms Pete into...being an unusual captive.

The film was made in black and white and has a really good use of shadows and that concave/convex lens thing. Why? I don't know. I failed to grasp what the filmmaker was trying to say.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1468713600,,531,4.247524752475248
8631949,5,B00HEM1IR6,"A very strange, haunting movie that stays with you.  Creepy and unforgettable.  One of the eeriest films I have ever seen.  Worth watching over to absorb all the nuances.  Would not recommend it to anyone who gets upset easily.",1454198400,3,227,4.743589743589744
