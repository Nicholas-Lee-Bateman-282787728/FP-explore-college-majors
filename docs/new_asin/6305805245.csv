1074128,5,6305805245,"Some have quibbles with the quality of the visuals on this DVD, but every version has some problems, because the film this was made from was almost lost ... I'm jut happy to be able to see it in any form - it's a really important moment of ballet & ballet film history.

4 ballets here, all very different, with different strengths.
The Diamond Muncher  - an unusual ""modern"" fable with marvelous melodies, especially the pas de duex.  With Zizi Jeanmaire
Cyranno - A lyric production that uses techniqes developed by the Archers, some slow-mo layering in the night time sequence... so very fitting to have Moira Shearer play Roxanne in this.  This one has really memororable visuals.
24 hour mourning - Is a truly funny story of a gold-digger played with fantastic articulation and fun by gorgeous Cyd Charisse ... It is a selfish and playful role with really witty choreograpy - esp. in the duel sequence.  The almost di-rigeur ballet strip sequence for her.  But done with great humor and still G rated.
Carmen - The most traditional of the bunch, this is just a really solid and interesting version of the ballet based on the opera... it stretches boundaries, because some of the flamenco is really hard to translate to ballet, but Zizi is the right woman for it.... and some of these sequences are almost NOT G... the pas de deux is about as suggestive as ballet has ever gotten.

It's a tour de force for the Paris Ballet, and it is joy that it has not been lost entirely.  It is also a time capsule of a very specific time in choreography, and in the filming of ballet.  Not to be missed for balletomaines!",1216684800,12,1613,4.553633217993079
1074129,3,6305805245,"i loved these ballet numbers and cyd charisse was so gorgeous and delightful.  and zizi was perfect as carmen and i loved cyrano.  but the quality of the disc was absolutely horrible!  blurry and skippy.  i felt that i had purchased a rip-off video.  so i give the movie 5 stars, and the quality of the disc one star, evening it out to about 3 stars i guess.",1215561600,2,358,4.205882352941177
1074130,3,6305805245,"i can't believe how poor in quality this disc was.  sometimes you can hardly make out any of the details.  but the dancing is magnificent.  and to see cyd charisse so young and glowing and absolutely gorgeous is a real treat.  and cyrano was wonderful, as was carmen.  i wasn't crazy about the first piece, but the rest are all worth it.  i want to give this disc a five star rating for what it contains, but it is just such a miserable printing.",1215216000,2,446,4.25
1074131,2,6305805245,"This DVD would not be very high on my list were it not for the final 10 minute bonus at the end of the program. After the unbearably kitschy Black Tights and Bolshoi '67, we discover an unexpected little gem titled Spring Night, an early experimental dance film.

Spring Night is a lushly erotic miniature ballet in the stylistic lineage of the Ballets Russes. It was made in 1935, only a half dozen years after the death of Serge Diaghilev. It was choreographed by the beautiful and sinuous Russian dancer David Lichine, who danced with and choreographed for Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo, one of the splinter companies that formed after the death of Diaghilev.

Spring Night is a Symbolist fusion of stunningly innovative dance, drama, spiritual subtext, cinematographer's art and music, produced by the very long-lived Adolph Zukor, who was one of the pioneers of the film industry. The elegant and hypnotic camera work was done by George Clemens, who went on to do the cinematography for Twilght Zone and other popular television shows.

The dancing is exquisite. Lichine's partner, Texan Nana Gollner is a lovely and inspired match for his exotic beauty, grace and elasticity. Their dancing has a mystical sensuality that is rarely seen. Lichine was a dancer/choreographer for the Ballets Russes, the same company that bore the crown jewel Nijinsky, one of the 20th century's most ingenius, mysterious and innovative dancers. Watching Lichine in the role of the Faun in Spring Night evokes images of Nijinsky as the same character, but in different works. Incredulously, there are no films of Nijinsky dancing, although photographs of him elude to something so beautiful, strange and uniquely groundbreaking that one weeps for more, and for his lost genius, stolen by schizophrenia extreme to such a degree that he had to leave the stage at a quite early age.

If you are at all interested in the Ballets Russes and its contributions to modern art, Spring Night is a gift. Especially if you have seen the outstanding, recently released documentary, Ballets Russes, you may find Spring Night to be especially important and informative. David Lichine's wife was one of the Baby Ballerinas featured in the documentary Ballets Russes, and is interviewed extensively there. There are film clips in BR of the beloved dance team David Lichine and his wife Tania Riabuchinska. She and her husband provided the dance of the Hippos in Disney's Fantasia. Ballets Russes

This short appears on a DVD with Black Tights and Boshoi '67, two lesser offerings that nonetheless have valuable moments, including a surrealistic Bolero danced by dazzling Bolshoi artists on the latter DVD.  You'll also have opportunities in Bolshoi '67 to see some of the greats of the Bolshoi during this era, including Maximova, Bessmertnova, Timofeyeva and Mikhail Lavrovsky.  Some of the choreography might be unbearable, like ""Paganini"", where the dancers are running around with violins (or pretend violins) but it's still a treat to view some of these greats in their prime.

Black Tights does have abundant beautiful women with long, gorgeous legs. But the choreography, music and content do not appeal to me, although it may to many others because of their attachment to some of the beauteous stars of the film, like Cyd Charise, Zizi Jean-Maire and Moira Shearer of The Red Shoes and Tales of Hoffmann.

The price of this DVD is worth paying just to experience Spring Night, a sacred artifact from the passing age of the Ballets Russes.

My only fear is that this short is not mentioned on Amazon's description of the program (although it never was, and was consequently quite a delicious surprise). If you are interested in seeing Spring Night, I recommend you contact the seller to see if it's listed on the box.",1208044800,5,3811,5.015822784810126
1074132,4,6305805245,This is a WONDERFUL MOVIE. I am curious as to the visual and sound quality of this newly published DVD. The other issue was really not to the par and showed that it was copied from an imperfect VHS. I hope this DVD comes around better.,1198281600,4,235,4.130434782608695
1074133,5,6305805245,Best combination of fetching legs since Eleanor Powell danced alone. The Carmen sequence was enchanting.,1184198400,3,104,6.0
1074134,4,6305805245,"I am a lifelong fan of Cyd Charisse and consider her the very best female dancer hollywood has ever produced - she never disappoints and her feature is the best of the DVD.  Moira Shearer, whom I also like but know less of, is also wonderful in her way, vulnerable and graceful.  I found Roland Petit's Cyrano (ballet, not his performance) a bit convoluted - a lot of material to get into a feauterette.  Zizi Jeanmarie is the epitome of the French dancer and the ballet itself the epitome of what we foreigners think Paris was back in the early 20th centura.",1172361600,10,559,4.46078431372549
1074135,4,6305805245,"BLACK TIGHTS is a delightful film which showcases 4 ballets choreographed by Roland Petit and featuring his well-known ballet troupe.  His wife Zizi Jeanmaire is the central figure in both ""La Croqueuse de Diamants"" and ""Carmen"".  Moira Shearer stars in ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" and Cyd Charisse cavorts in ""Deuil en 24 Heures"".  Maurice Chevalier appears to introduce each segment.

For fans of Zizi Jeanmaire, the movie is a must just for ""Carmen"" alone.  This was the ballet created especially for her by Roland Petit.  It launched her international career and she danced the role from London to Broadway.  This film perfectly recreates the original production, highlighted by her beguiling footwork in ""Seguidille"".  Petit recreates the role of Don Jose.  ""La Croqueuse de Diamants"" is the story of a young woman who lives in a den of thieves and loves to eat diamonds (as Chevalier says, ""charming, but expensive"").  Jeanmaire's special charms radiate off the screen.

In ""Cyrano de Bergerac"", Moira Shearer of THE RED SHOES fame plays Roxanne with Roland Petit in the title role.  The story of unrequited love plays out it's tragic course and Shearer emotes beautifully as the conflicted Roxanne.  Petit gives arguably one of his greatest performances as Cyrano.

""Deuil en 24 Heures"" features Cyd Charisse as a young coquette who flirts with younger men, enraging her more-mature husband who gets killed in a duel.  The young woman then decides to kick up her heels at Maxim's.

Each of the 30-minute segments is a complete joy.  You have no less than 3 of the most beautiful ballet dancers to appear onscreen, coupled with Roland Petit's innovative and economic choreography.  A film that balletomanes won't be able to resist!",1119139200,32,1730,5.074468085106383
1074395,5,6305805245,"Great dance film! Roland Petit and Zizi Jeanmarie are amazing! Very creative choreography and strong, strong dancing. A piece of dance history definitely worth your time.",1457568000,,170,5.576923076923077
1074396,3,6305805245,"This film is an interesting collection of French dance vignettes. It's excellent for what it is; but I was hoping for an undiscovered movie musical, which it is not. The dances are interesting to watch, but there's no story to link them together.",1453507200,,246,4.744186046511628
1074397,3,6305805245,"I saw this film in 1961 when it was given a 70mm release with a six track stereophonic soundtrack - it was a great introduction to modern ballet in a distinctively French style with choreography by Roland Petit. The quality of the dancing in the four sequences was of a very high standard and the production values of the film as a whole was superb. However this release is very disappointing with very poor quality sound and picture. This film should be remastered and presented in it's original format on Blue Ray. I am sure that there would be a sufficiently large market to justify such a release given the many estimable releases of ballet on DVD and Blue Ray designed for home consumption. Twilight Time and Screen Archives specialize in re releasing many classic movies and musicals of this era in an exceptionally high standard of presentation..
Also a release of Raintree County and Porgy and Bess should also be re released.",1451347200,,934,4.736196319018405

Cyd Charisse in particular, in one decent vignette, made this dvd desirable for me.

1074508,1,6305805245,"The problem is that the aspect ration of the DVD is wrong. This film was made in Technirama 70mm, so the aspect ratio should be roughly 2.35.1. So you're missing at least half of the image. Having said that, it was pretty dreadful when it first came out. But the transfer from that process should be stunning. This is something somebody should be held responsible for. The print is THAT bad. Don't even think about buying this.

1074509,5,6305805245,"The passion and imagination of the choreography and music in this stunning performance (Cyrano de Bergerac) is life-changing. Petit and his dancers, along with Marius Constant's inspired musical score will make its mark on you!",1393286400,,227,5.514285714285714

1074511,4,6305805245,"As some said, as a rabid lover of dance, this was my first pick to watch after signing up for Amazon Prime. First I had to delete then re-download the player to get a moving picture and sound--and that's something for a tech-challenged person. But then it went well. I totally agree with the comments about the poor picture and sound quality--really too bad. That being said, I adore dance and all of these particular dancers. Got to see more of Jeanmaire and Pettit and his choreography than I had ever seen before and thought they were fantastic. Overall, I think this is still a very good production of 4 diverse short ballets whose style in every way is representative of the 1960s era. From Chevalier's amiable presentation, to the coloration of the artwork of intros and credits, nothing avante garde or risqu&eacute; or overtly sensual--although all stories and emotions were thoroughly presented. If the print and sound was excellent, it would be outstanding. I will watch it again and again, until the film dries up and blows away.",1390521600,,1040,4.815642458100559

1074514,1,6305805245,"Titles of ballets on this DVD looked very promising. Also, I wanted to see the art of Zizi which I never saw.
However, the record is not interesting and even boring. Old choreography is not impressive in comparison with modern versions of all these ballets that we saw many times last 20 years, old record technique is not good, no dynamic, even the performance looks primitive sometimes. I'm pretty disappointed with this disk, despite Roland Petit dances himself in his 30th.",1299974400,2,477,4.901234567901234
1074515,4,6305805245,"I love this film from my late teens as my family were involved in ballet and classical music - I used to sneak out of school on sports day to go to the matinee ballet presentations when they were on! This release is satisfactory and am grateful that I can retire at last my ancient and worn VHS release.

Fortunately as I transfer all my DVD's etc onto my NAS server I was able to make some slight apparent quality improvements. The image is widescreen and in the original aspect ratio but not anamorphic so it is letterboxed within a 4:3 frame. I was able to make a 16:9 version using virtualdub with a few avisynth filters. Much improved on my widescreen Samsung TV. Playing back the DVD as supplied I had a postage stamp presentation . ie black bars all around and this can be the price of non anamorphic releases. Why the studio didn't do an anamorphic release is beyond me especially as they had access to the original film. Easy enough to do and doesn't cost any more to do it - it's just a technical step. The technical proces I used was to remove the black bars and enlarge the image to fit a 16:9 frame together with a few noise reduction filters. Fortunately the video signal was strong and the colour balance Ok so enlarging didn't add any artifacts

The other disappointment is the audio is only a mono presentation. My next step is to replace the audio with the audio from the early Pye vinyl stereo release of the entire soundtrack including dialog. This will take me sometime as there will be sync problems to solve. If I'm successful I will make another post.... maybe!",1296172800,2,1585,4.443298969072165
1074516,1,6305805245,"Great choreography by Roland Petit, but the poor quality of this Synergy Archive DVD ruined it for me -- everything is out of focus, like an old used VHS tape purchased at some thrift store. -- The Black Tights (1960)DVD is much,much better.",1277683200,3,241,4.627906976744186
1074517,2,6305805245,"I read all the reviews about what a horrible transfer to dvd this movie was and I more than agree - infact I've got a couple of my own comments to make. Not only is the image fuzzy but there is something wrong with the actual motion picture aspect that the transfer completely messed up. The picture does not flow at the required pace to depict real motion. Its as if they removed every other frame from the original film causing the motion to constantly jump rather than flow as it should do. Now you can defend this all you want by saying it is the last existing copy of a nearly lost work of art. But to take something as graceful as ballet and have the motion completely screwed up is like the audio equivalent of having Jerry Lewis provide Elvis Presley's voice in Jailhouse Rock (Ok I admit that's a strange comparison). I bought the Reel Classic Film version and I know of two other distributers who released this film and I'm wondering if the other versions are just as motion deprived? I saw a VHS version once and don't recall it having any motion problems. I really think the dvd release does not just suffer from bad original material but instead from a low budgit release. Also, I question the identity of some of the people who sanction these flaws and wonder if they are some how involved with their production.",1235865600,9,1326,4.438524590163935

Even so, the movie is well worth watching if you have any interest in seeing ballets and dancers from an era when ballet had a much greater importance in popular culture than it does now.

For me, it was great to see, rather than just read about, the choreography of Roland Petit and the dancing of Zizi Jeanmaire, Moira Shearer, and Petit. Yes, the camerawork often is geared more to filmheads than bunheads (however, I will always give the director, Terence Young, the benefit of the doubt because he also directed the three best James Bond pictures!) and Shearer was more spectacular in The Red Shoes and The Tales of Hoffman, but there really aren't many other ways for present day ballet fans to get a feel for the work of these legends. And even though Cyd Charisse is better known for her non-ballet work in Hollywood, she did train with Nijinska and dance with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo so its both novel and interesting to see Charisse dancing in a classical style and doing pointe work.

Maybe Black Tights will be given a proper restoration somedayCriterions Blu-ray version of The Red Shoes shows how to do everything right, for examplebut until then, Im going with three stars.",1500336000,,1298,4.68859649122807
