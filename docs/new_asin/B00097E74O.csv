8058417,3,B00097E74O,"This is not a great movie, however it has an interesting cast.  According to IMDB the original title is El refugio del miedo and it's directed by Jose Ulolla.  The main attraction for me were the actresses Teresa Gimpera and Patty Shepard, who show up in a lot of Spanish titles from the era. Craig Hill is billed as lead actor, and his highlight in B-movies was probably the rather good ""The Bloodstained Shadow"" (Solamente nero) directed by Antonio Bido, which was a sort of late giallo (1978).  The DVD itself is by ""JEF Films"" and is a somewhat murky, almost dupey looking print that occassionally emerges in clarity.  Hopefully we will have a better print in the future, but since not all movies from this time period were well-preserved, it may be this is the best available.  In brief the story revolves around two families, one married couple with a grown son, and one without a child.  Apparently the men both served in the military together before the ""bomb"" struck and they are living together in a shelter, which is underground.  That's the skeleton on this otherwise tangled drama in which Patty Shepard's character longs to break free of their routine, and gets sick of her husband, who has retreated into drug dependency.  The son (who looks a lot older than his supposed age) goes through a crisis precipitated by the lustful Shepard character, and Teresa Gimpera tries to keep everyone together but has her own breakdown.  Craig Hill's character seems to have his own agenda ... but that's reason enough to watch this film to find out.  It looks made on a K-Mart budget, the video and sound are rather dodgy, yet somehow this manages to be entertaining.  Recommended for those who love Spanish films of the period, and definitely to fans of Teresa Gimpera and Patty Shepard (who, by the way, has a brief flash of nudity in the film).  Personally I would give the movie four stars for good, but the print on this DVD brings the rating down, as some may find it too poor to enjoy.",1339804800,2,1995,4.636363636363637
