5092871,5,B007K7ICFQ,One of the best independent films of the last ten years. Josh Folan is terrifying!,1474934400,,82,4.533333333333333
5092872,5,B007K7ICFQ,"Ten minutes into the film I thought I wouldn't like it. But it was a good movie. A serial killer falls in love with a troubled prostitute. It's the acting that kept me interested, I really liked both actors. The story was pretty good also. This movie was excellent for the amount of money it took to make it. If I had any issues with it, I'd say the sound needed some work, but it wasn't bad enough for me to decrease my rating.",1399766400,3,428,4.107142857142857
5092873,2,B007K7ICFQ,"Jon (Josh Folan) is introduced as a prostitute serial killer from his upper floor NYC apartment. We don't know why he does this, other than being psychotic or how he disposes of the bodies other than the hands which he collects in jars.  As a bistro worker he befriends Delia (Jessica Kaye) who happens to be a prostitute with issues which we understand slightly better than Jon.

The film starts out with a bang and falls into a rut. It is slow getting out of the rut as we watch Jon and Delia go through their routines. About 15 minutes from the end is where I had hoped this film had been 20 minutes into the film, although that film has already been done. This is the type of film that is best as a dark comedy. This one wasn't. Not a horror film. It is billed as a drama/romance/thriller although this is far from expectations of a romance film. Jon gives us a look into his personality with some first person narration by telling us his favorite movies. I really didn't get much from it or this film.

Clearly not for everyone.

5092874,4,B007K7ICFQ,"Fate brings a struggling prostitute into the arms of a lonely serial killer, giving each of them the chance at love that neither of them thought they deserved. More of a dark character drama than a true Horror film, ALL GOD'S CREATURES brings together two talented young actors in a twisted love story that challenges the meaning of the word. Straying from cheap flights down bad roads they've relied on so heavily in the past, they may have found a new path together. There is no hero when both characters are attempting to hide a secret life filled with regrets, but their efforts to overcome their troubled pasts truly humanizes them. Writer Josh Folan is ideal as Jon, delivering a cold and soulless performance that often recalls Michael C. Hall's Dexter. He could only be topped by Jessica Kaye in the role of Delia, the dark-haired beauty whose wild spontaneity and crass behavior instantly draw the audience in to her performance. Folan's script explores the psychology of a serial killer in love, and his struggle to separate the psychosexual urge to kill from his growing infatuation. It also touches on darker themes of desperation, sexual violence, and suicide that place a somber mood over the couple's budding romance. ALL GOD'S CREATURES is a strong entry into this year's Indie Horror scene that will rank highly among fans of Bret Easton Ellis and Jeff Lindsay.

5092875,5,B007K7ICFQ,"Solid flick, great music, hilarious filmmaker commentary track. There's a lot (i.e. too many) of options out there for little micro-budget indie films, and this one is easily one of the better ones.",1339286400,4,198,5.03030303030303
8518944,5,B007K7ICFQ,"At first, I thought this was going to be rather derivative of American Psycho, but it quickly went a whole different direction. The delevoping love story is quite a twist.

The back story stories are not well developed, leaving us with no clue as to why Jon does what he does. We also are never given much information on the problems Delia is running from and why she refuses to take her sister out of that situation.

The music was great. It seemed to set the mood perfectly.",1529884800,,476,4.3977272727272725
8518945,4,B007K7ICFQ,"This thing kept me engaged wondering how it could possibly get me to feel any sort of sympathy for a serial killer. The lead actress was too good looking and refined for her role, but I thought the lead actor did a good job. The ending worked for me.",1504483200,,250,4.122448979591836
8518946,2,B007K7ICFQ,This film could've & should've been much better. It was alright but I'm glad it was free with Prime. Some of the dialog was written by down syndrome chimpanzees. It's one of those movies that is good for when there's nothing else that catches your interest or for background noise while getting some or falling asleep lol.,1501027200,,322,4.666666666666667
8518947,4,B007K7ICFQ,"RELEASED IN 2011 and directed by Ryan Charles & Frank Licata, ""All Gods Creatures"" stars Josh Folan as an amiable New Yorker who murders young women in his spare time. His hero is Ted Bundy, which pretty much tells you everything you need to know. Upon meeting a woman at the java joint where he works (Jessica Kaye) he finds himself inspired to change. Tiffany Lee plays the latters younger sis and Adam Barnett her abusive beau.

This is a serial killer movie thatll probably turn you off in the first ten minutes due to the murderers misogyny and nasty hobby, but it perks up with the introduction of the woman and the killers subsequent inspiration. While this is a micro-budgeted movie, costing only $30,000, it doesnt seem like it, except for the lousy sound in a few scenes. The movie shows professional style with a capable cast and a stellar modern rock soundtrack, not to mention the big city locations. Folan comes across as a more serious Jim Carrey and, amazingly, he & the script goad you to start caring for the psychotic slayer. Kaye shows charisma as the girl forced to make ends meet anyway she can while, incredibly, remaining pretty chipper about life.

Unfortunately, for me, the movie chooses to wallow in the mud. The filmmakers coulda gone for something radically different; and the second act dares to point in this direction (for which the flick should be commended). Yet the final act opts for the silly slasher/horror movie ending with a theme no deeper than birds of a feather. Nonetheless, All Gods Creatures is worth checking out if you can stomach serial killer pictures. In tone (and even plot, to a degree), its akin to a low-budget Eye of the Beholder (1999).

THE FILM RUNS 83 minutes and was shot in New York City & Oyster Bay. The screenplay was written by Josh Folan with additional material by Billy Fox.

8518950,2,B007K7ICFQ,"I guess I'm just tired of seeing girls tortured in the most horrible way, mouths duct taped shut and then wrapped in plastic. That was in the first 5 minutes. I'm ready for some situations where women turn the tables and deal with the men.",1479513600,3,239,4.333333333333333
8518951,4,B007K7ICFQ,"Won't give anything away but one of the BETTER horror movies I've seen in a while. Maybe more insane than scary, maybe both!! The plot is actually good and the four lead roles are acted excellently and they are not plastic characters filling in some time between the serial killer's murders.
That's all I'll say.
I am BRUTAL on ratings, RARELY giving three stars.  Trust me on this one.",1479168000,5,386,4.594202898550725
