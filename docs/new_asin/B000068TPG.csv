1726689,5,B000068TPG,"Shelly Winters is great at playing unhinged characters. In WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN?, she teams up with Debbie Reynolds in a tale about two mothers of convicted killers who move to california in order to escape the publicity and threats against them. Helen (Winters) begins to slowly unravel, revealing the true psychotic within. Haunted by the death of her husband, she becomes increasingly dangerous to herself and others, especially Adelle (Reynolds), who may or may not survive. There are some snappy dance routines (highlighting Debbie Reynolds' talent and cuteness) scattered throughout. Watch for Dennis Weaver (Duel) as Adelle's love interest.-WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?- has Shelly Winters as Roo, the rich widow of a famous magician. She lost her daughter Katherine in an accident and has trusted in a phony medium (Ralph Richardson) for years, paying him a small fortune so he can ""contact"" Katherine. Well, it's all a big scam of course, helping to push Roo over the edge. Some children from a local orphanage visit ""Auntie Roo"" every christmas. This year, one of the little girls resembles Roo's daughter, causing the bats in her belfry to really start a flappin'! She kidnaps the girl and her brother Christopher (Mark ""Oliver"" Lester), keeping them locked in her secret attic (did I mention that she keeps her mummified daughter up there too?). The rest is cat and mouse as the children try to escape Roo's insanity. In the kids' minds, they are living out ""Hansel and Gretel"", with Roo as the perfectly wicked witch. If you enjoy movies where Shelly Winters goes crazy, then this double feature can't be beat! Highly recommended...",1094860800,56,1649,5.0661764705882355
1726690,5,B000068TPG,"Aaah, you just gotta love these MGM double feature discs. Regarding their DVD releases, MGM always leaves out a whole lot in terms of special features. All you usually get is a trailer and maybe a widescreen transfer, but these amazing double dipper discs resurrect films you never thought would see the light of day. ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" are excellent examples of two films that taken on their own would probably never show up on DVD. Or if they did, some seedy outfit looking to make a quick buck on a grainy, cropped release would peddle them. Yet here they are with gloriously clean transfers in all their wacky, over the top splendor. I can't say I've ever been a Shelley Winters fan, excepting her outrageously campy performance in ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" but I must say I have a newfound respect for the aging thespian after watching these two knee slappers. What can I say? I love schlocky cinema, and ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" are prime examples of films so slathered in cheese that your cholesterol level will skyrocket within minutes of popping the disc into your player.
Of the two films, ""What's the Matter with Helen"" is by far the best. Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds play Helen Hill and Adelle Bruckner, two women who flee to California during the Depression to escape the media frenzy after their sons go to prison for murder. Fortunately, Helen knows how to play the piano and Adelle knows how to dance, so the two women open up a dance studio for the precocious offspring of Hollywood parents. Things start to go downhill when Helen begins breaking down psychologically because of her son's crimes. She worries that the threatening phone call the two women received back home, which served as one impetus to head west, is coming back to haunt the two. As Hill plumbs the depths of insanity, Adelle's fortunes are looking up. Her dance studio puts on a recital that is the talk of the town, and she's finally met a nice guy by the name of Lincoln Palmer (Dennis Weaver) who seems interested in a long-term relationship. Bruckner's success severely strains the already fragile bond between the two gals, leading to a truly memorable series of events culminating in a quite shocking-and endlessly humorous-conclusion. ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" gives you Shelley sticking her hand in a fan, lots of rabbits, Agnes Moorehead slumming as an Aimee Simple McPherson type preacher, and Reynolds hoofing it up in a series of tacky platinum blonde wigs.
""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" finds Shelley Winters hamming it up in a schlocky take on ""Hansel and Gretel."" The story unfolds in England during the 1920s, where an eccentric, wealthy old woman named Rosie Forrest (Winters) plays host to a select bunch of tots from the local orphanage during the Christmas holidays. A brother and sister, Christopher and Katy, who aren't invited to the shindig, trick their way into the house anyway at which point Forrest takes a real shine to Katy. Why? Turns out that Rosie's own daughter passed away in a tragic banister sliding accident years before. The old woman never recovered from the disaster, and spends most of her time attempting to contact her deceased child with the help of flaky spiritualist Mr. Benson (Ralph Richardson taking one on the chin for a paycheck) and her sinister butler. With the arrival of Katy, however, Rosie thinks she can return to the halcyon days of yesteryear by adopting the adorable tike. Christopher, sensing something horribly wrong with Forrest's disposition, throws a bunch of wrenches in the old woman's well-laid plans. Lot's of surprises in this story, as Winters eventually goes completely off her rocker when Katy and Christopher refuse to play ball.
Perhaps the biggest surprise in ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" is the wonderful Debbie Reynolds. Not only does she tear up the dance floor in several memorable scenes (ahem), her platinum blonde look suits her well in a sort of sleazy yet incredibly attractive way. I'm not sure what the film was trying to say exactly, but Reynolds and Winters have good chemistry together onscreen. Another surprise is the somewhat authentic looking 1930's attire and scenery, surprising because low budget sludge like this usually doesn't pay much attention to props. As for ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo,"" Winters takes center stage and holds onto it with both meaty hands. Even as a laughed at the ridiculous scenarios unfolding on the television, I couldn't help but notice that I actually felt sorry for Shelley's character even as she engaged in odious activities. I've seen so many low budget films that can't achieve any sort of dimension to their characters that to actually see one that does is shocking. Further reflection after the viewing experience led me to conclude that all the credit should go to the acting chops of Shelley Winters. Sure, she hams it up, but that she can ham it up and still convey other emotions is quite an accomplishment.
If you're worried about watching two films starring Shelley Winters, don't. To watch Shelley Winters here is to love Shelley Winters. Of course, if you don't like schlock you won't like anything about these two films no matter what I say. Again, kudos goes to MGM for releasing these two classics on one DVD with a great picture transfer. While neither film is particularly scary or graphically gory, they are entertaining in terms of hilarity and general kookiness. I am eternally grateful I stumbled over these two classics, and you might be too if you give them a chance. Enjoy!",1089331200,31,5610,4.900105152471083
1726691,5,B000068TPG,"As a fan of Debbie Reynolds as a child (via her t.v. show in 1969), my mother's interest was jarred when ""What's The Matter With Helen?"" was released in 1971. I knew of Shelley Winters, but only from her older films played on t.v.
So, me, at age 9, went with mom to see a double-feature. ""Wait Until Dark"", and ""What's The Matter With Helen?"". Seems ""Helen"" didn't play well in my area so the theater double billed it. ""Wait Until Dark"" was in my eyes a well-acted thriller that after watching the finale HAD to be seen in a theater to get the most impact.
""Helen"" on the other hand started out as a black and white newsreel, that suddenly came to life in color. I asked mom if we were seeing the right film. As the film progressed, i came to realize why Shelley and Debbie were acting legends. Why the critics hated the film at the time puzzled me, but the climax of the film was first rate (scared me half to death for a 9 year old), and the subdued violence kept the film from being too exploitative, as the story was more important.
Like Harrington's comment on the publicity of the film, the poster killed the film's success, as the so-called surprise ending was revealed.
To the film buffs, ""Helen"" was nominated for an Academy Award for best Costume Design. As a time period film, the re-creation of the 1930's was dead-on. Tho I agree this film includes Shelley's best performance, who can deny that there were no stiff actors, as each character was fully explained, rare for a horror film.
""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo"" was a film i didn't get to see in the theaters. It came and went to quickly at the local drive-in. I did finally see it on video, and tho Shelley's performance was over the top, the story had too many loose ends. Considering the publicity of the film, you would think Shelley was a child killer, when in fact, she is not. Troubled yes, killer, no. It's a well-acted film, and again, another time-piece setting, but you HAVE to like Shelley to enjoy this one.
I rate the dvd package 5 out of 5, only for the fact that the quality of the films are gorgeous, and hoping new fans will appreciate these films as much as i have.",1057017600,,2147,4.37
1726692,5,B000068TPG,"I haven't seen this SHOCKER since I was a kid. A truely terrifying character study about a dowdy religious woman who goes psycho. I remember seeing this when I was 11 years old with my cousin. We'd go to the Saturday Afternoon Double Feature and if the first film was good we'd sit through it twice. Needless to say we sat through this ONE twice and then went to see it again then the following week. Shelley Winters scared the BEEJEEZUS out of us. Ahhh, the good ol' days. Good Horror Movies should give little kids nightmares and I can tell you I had them for weeks after seeing this GREAT MOVIE. I agree with a previous reviewer. This one stands alone. I haven't seen WHO SLEW so I can't comment on it.
I also remember staying up late as a kid to watch this by myself. Alone. So Midnite Movie is a great title. Does anyone still show old movies late at night? I don't have cable. God, I miss the LATE SHOW. Where did they find this? MGM IS THE BEST!! They put out great old catalog stuff that probably doesn't make them much money. That's refreshing. At least someone is preserving some great old cult favorites.
I haven't seen this in probably 25 years. Can anyone tell me if the scene with the plow that graphically runs over Shelley Winter's father's face is still in this flick? That scene was horrifying!! I GOTTA GET THIS!!",1038268800,4,1332,4.375

1726694,5,B000068TPG,"MGM Midnite Movies delivers the goods again with this fantastic Shelley Winters double feature!
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN? was directed by Curtis Harrington and released in 1971.  The story concerns Adelle Bruckner (Debbie Reynolds) and Helen Hill (Shelley Winters), the mothers of two convicted murderers who soon become the targets of hate-crimes and prank phonecalls.  Adelle decides to re-locate her kiddy's dance school to Hollywood, and invites Helen to come along as her pianist.  Just when it seems that the past is just a painful memory, Helen's sanity slowly slips away.
Debbie looks gorgeous in the 1930's period setting, and Shelley makes the most out of her role; there is a certain campy charm about this little number, a horror film which has elements of musical-comedy and romance.  The film was nominated for a Best Art Directed Academy Award.
WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO? was also directed by Curtis Harrington and was released in 1972.  The story concerns Roo Forrest (Shelley Winters), a rich woman still grieving the death of her young daughter Katharine.  Every Christmas, she hosts a party for 10 chosen children from the city's orphanage.  This year, two unruly children have tagged along - Christopher (Mark Lester - OLIVER!) and his little sister Katy (Chloe Franks - A LITTLE NIGHT MUSIC).  Roo takes a shying to Katy, who bears a haunting resemblance to the dead Katharine.  When Katy fails to appear when the children are due to go back to the orphanage, Christopher fears the worst.
Originally conceived as a horror-movie version of ""Hansel and Gretel"", ROO? is a charming film, shot entirely on location in England, and Shelley looks fabulous as the twisted ""Auntie Mame""-esque character.  The film also features Ralph Richardson as a medium and Judy Cornwell (TV's ""Keeping Up Appearances"") as Roo's sneaky maid.
The trailers for both films are also included.  (Double-sided, single-layer disc).",1031788800,4,1926,5.160771704180064
1726695,5,B000068TPG,"I saw ""Helen"" on it's release in 1971 and it's been one of my favorite films ever since. On the surface, it's a delicious send up of 30's Hollywood---colorful and expertly crafted. Underneath, it's a bizarre case study of obsessive pyschosis---one woman over another. The two women are polar opposites who are bound together by tragedy and circumstances. One is dowdy and Bible-spouting(Winters) while the other is smart and sexy(i.e ""sinful"") played by Reynolds. Reynolds' character is the strong one-although she gives that credit(wrongly) to Winters' character. But they, together, forge ahead with their lives as two equally strong survivors despite their obvious differences. While all the while fate begins rearing it's ugly head. Winter's character-Helen-is obsessive and jealous in her relationship with Adele(Reynolds) and begins to crack up -threatening Adele's security and success. Note the scene where Helen sniffs Adele's lingerie! Fate finally arrives one dark and stormy night and the two are bound anew by yet another grisly circumstance-giving Helen another uncomfortable edge over Adele. Adele is finally reduced begrudgingly to Helen's caretaker as Helen has gone nuts (as only Winters can) and things get even uglier as twists and turns lead this tale to it's inevitable conclusion. Played with gusto by everyone involved, ""Helen"",to me, is a one-of-kind film with a once-in-a-lifetime cast. Reynolds gets to show off quite a bit---she's thin and beautiful---and Winters matches her with her frumpy,frustrated neurosis turning deadly. The costumes are gorgeous and the whole thing has a wonderful nostalgic feel to it. Curtis Harrington does wonders with this piece and it shows in every frame. I recommend this for buffs everywhere. However, I have one quibble--I wish this had been released solo instead of on a double bill with ""Auntie Roo"" (more Winters) which I had no desire to see then AND STILL DON'T. But that's show business! Nonetheless, for the price, ""Helen"" alone is well worth it and I would have paid more. It's a keeper!",1031529600,6,2058,5.315950920245399
1726696,5,B000068TPG,"I just got this DVD, having never seen ""Helen"". Well, aside from having Shelley Winters in common, both were directed by Curtis Harrington. It's a good lesson in what studio and budget can do for a film. ""What's the Matter with Helen"" is pure studio (United Artists) with high production values (Oscar nominated Costumes), true 30's period sets and a wonderful narrative written by Henry Farrell (""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?""). Shelley has never been better and Debbie Reynolds is absolutely marvelous, as the two play mothers of teen-age sons sent to jail and escape together to Hollywood. Debbie dances and Shelley plays piano; Debbie wants to be a Jean Harlow type, while Shelley slowly descends into her Bible study. I won't blab away any plot points, but there is a great cameo by Agnes Moorehead, and Dennis Weaver is quite fine as a rich ""McCloud""-type. There is real suspense that kept me guessing, a few twists, which all add up to a great period piece that's loads of fun and craziness. There's also a wonderful performance by Michael MacLiammoir whose sinister presence adds to the suspense. ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" (released in America as ""Who Slew Auntie Roo?""), on the other hand, was a quickie by Harrington, with lower production values and filmed in England. They were also capitalizing on young Mark Lester (from ""Oliver!""). Shelley, in this one, overacts shamelessly, though with this type of film, it's appropriate. It's basically a re-telling of ""Hansel and Gretel"" with obvious modern twists. It's no less entertaining than ""Helen"", but as released by American-International, no other distributor would touch it. There are wonderful performances by the likes of Sir Ralph Richardson, Lionel Jeffries and Hugh Griffith, but it's super-campy (very ""70's"") and did well at the box-office. Shelley went on to receive the last of her many Oscar nominations the following year (1972) for her over-the-top hammy performance in ""The Poseidon Adventure"". Perhaps it was the Academy's way of rewarding her for the great performance in ""Helen"". In 1961, movies centering on evil old women seemed to thrive (""Baby Jane"", ""Strait Jacket"", ""Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte"", etc.), and, though ""Helen"" could stand on its own as classy entertainment, ""Auntie Roo"" kinda killed that genre. With its modest price and loads of the wonderful Shelley, this would be a welcome addition to your DVD library.",1030579200,10,2412,5.155612244897959
1726697,5,B000068TPG,"Curtis Harrington has been one of my favorite Directors since I first saw the 1967 movie GAMES with Katherine Ross at the theater. (I was 9 years old and it scared me to death.)  I also greatly admired NIGHT TIDE with Dennis Hopper while watching it on late night television in the late 60's.  Then along came WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN? and WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO? in 1971.  That same year I had seen a Made-for-T.V. movie titled REVENGE with Shelley Winters.  Her over-the-top, intense performance in that film had such an impact on me that I couldn't wait to see WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN?  When I realized that Curtis Harrington had directed the film I knew I was in for a treat.  Little did I know that HELEN would become one of my favorite horror movies.  Once again, Shelley did not disappoint this 13 year old who was sitting there not embarrased to be clutching his mother's arm.  Harrington's deft direction and ability to create a moody atmosphere in the tradition of Grand Guignol combined with Shelley Winters' brilliant performance makes this film a 5 star effort.  Then, to add icing on the cake, Harrington paired with Winters once again that year with WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO?  A very clever update of the Hanzel and Gretel fairy tale.  Not as scary as HELEN but just as atmospheric.  This time around, Shelley secured her clawhold as Hollywood's ""grande-dame"" ghoul. (With orange hair to boot!) I love both of these movies and recommend them to those of you who like your ""horror"" mixed with a little gothic and nostalgia.  Also check out THE DEVIL'S DAUGHTER made-for-T.V. 1972 with Shelley Winters and THE KILLING KIND 1973 directed by Curtis Harrington. (His most disturbing work.)",1024790400,34,1708,4.7687074829931975

1726773,3,B000068TPG,"For Shelley Winters fans this double edition gives you two movies of madness in the inimitable Winters style. Sadly neither of the films is that great.
""Helen"" sees Shelley Winters team up with Debbie Reynolds as two mothers united by the shame of having offspring convicted of murder, and together they try and start a new life of anonymity. That's really the extent of the plot, so it's hardly horror in content. The pair start to bicker and fall out, and Winters' character start to display more of an unhinged nature, which leads to a tragic climax , but there really isn't a lot happening to chill the viewer. At least the performances are good.

""Auntie Roo"" is more confusing in it's intentions. Here we have Winters playing a batty old dame with a large mansion, who likes to invite children across for parties to ease her loneliness. Unfortunately two of the children get a bit nosey and Auntie Roo's dark secrets come tumbling out. What's wrong here is that the plot doesn't really give the viewer any clearly defined direction. Auntie Roo is not the witch that the children think she is, in fact the children terrorise her more than she does them. I don't know if the story is supposed to paint Roo as the villain, or the children. It's all over the place. Who are you supposed to like? Nobody? Shelley Winters does a good job here, but the two children (Mark Lester and Chloe Franks) sadly do not. I can't imagine anyone coming away at the end of the film feeling satisfied.

These Midnite Movie double packs are good value though, even if the films are not great, they do pick some of the more obscure things to release, for which we should be grateful. Shame they give away the ending of ""Helen"" on the cover illustration, though!",1426032000,,1744,4.586538461538462

The interactions between the two female friends, how they react to strangers, and how they both deal with their own situations and past were all very interesting. That was where the 4 stars come from. The second film, ""Whoever slew Auntie Roo"", was ok. I found it had too many plot holes which I won't go into because it would spoil the plot. At the price it is definitely worth it for the first film. I would also like to point out that the audio in ""What's the matter with Helen?"" at around 38:00 mins to 38:10 drops out, when Helen is talking. Not a biggie but just wanted to alert anyone interested.",1307318400,,738,4.316546762589928
1726836,4,B000068TPG,"I ran across this title when I was surfing the horror genre for bargains (it was under $6.)  So, I bought it for price, the first movie, and laughing at the title of the second movie.

As I had seen it long ago in a galaxy far away, I had forgotten all of ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" except the very last scene with her at the piano which was a shocker.  Actually, it was very well done and acted.  Shelley Winters is wonderful in this movie as a woman driven insane by the past events of her life.  Very believeable acting and the story moves at a decent pace.

Shelley reprises her crazy woman type character in ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"".  This is a pretty forgetable movie: the only thing shocking is that she keeps the skeleton corpse of her daughter in the house with her.  This movie was done in a way that reminds me of the ""Movie of the Week"" you used to see on TV.

You have to remember that ""Helen"" was made in 1971.  If you can be patient, I would recommend the movie as it is character and story driven and takes time to develop.  There was no such thing as special effects at the time, so they made movies a lot different then.  Actually, the story is so good, I am really surprised no one has tried to remake this film.  Definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it before.",1301702400,,1296,4.198380566801619
1726837,3,B000068TPG,"I had not seen the movie ""What's the matter with Helen"" until I bought this DVD. It was quite unique from any other movie plot and entertaining with a surprise ending. Both Shelly Winters and Debbie Reynolds were terrific in their roles on this film.

""Whoever slew Auntie Roo""... I have never cared for this movie and didn't like it any better this time around. Roo was not monstrous enough to deserve the fate of being burned alive by these nasty brats. Granted, Roo was a bit off her rocker in her obsession over her dead daughter... between the seances and fixation on treating her daughter's body as if it were alive. However, despite the fact that Roo had snatched one of the orphans which reminded her of her deceased daughter... Roo really did not pose any harm to the children. She was adoring of the girl and wanted to adopt her... understandably without her nasty brother.

Thus, the behavior of the orphan girl's brother was completely out of line. The film had him obsessed in comparing Roo to the Gingerbread house witch and setting her on fire while stealing her jewels... The children were just nasty brat murderers and the story did not provide reason enough to justify the vile act of the children burning Roo alive.

The movie backfired on the screenwriter and director because they did not make Roo enough of a villain. Therefore, the story conversely created bad children and made Roo the victim. Roo was more of a tragic figure who had lost her reasoning with the death of her daughter. The orphan girl reminded her of her daughter. The story did not correspond with the gingerbread house theme the director intended. Instead, it created two bad children who heinously killed a woman in a most vicious manner without justification. A woman who had lost her mind in her extreme grief over the loss of her child. The boy needed to be institutionalized for his cold-blooded, deadly deeds and complete lack of morals, reasoning, compassion, or decency. Instead, they have the two children gloating and laughing over their dastardly, unthinkable deed as they left with the jewels they had stolen from her.

I certainly don't recommend either movie for children... As for adults, it might be ok as a cult movie or a movie for Shelly Winter's fans... as long as you keep in mind that the morals in this movie are completely upside down. The victim was not the villain... the children were.",1298764800,5,2404,4.730310262529833
1726838,3,B000068TPG,"I won't get into the movies themselves - both are delightful campy fun and both showcase Shelley Winters' talents for playing kooky over-the-top crazy women. I'll simply get right to the point of this DVD package.

I really won't bemoan the lack of bonus features here, as we're lucky to get these films on DVD at all, let alone with a trailer. Maybe some period featurettes or something would have been nice, but the important thing here is the value of getting two movies on one disc for a fantastic price.

First off, instead of creating a flipper disc, MGM could have placed both films and trailers very nicely onto a single-sided DVD9 disc. I don't necessarily mind flippers, but I prefer single-sided discs.

Both transfers are decent enough, but each one has its own problems. Helen's transfer suffers from major fluctuations in color palette, which is often most visible on the skin tones - the actors often go from having orange skin as if they just stepped out of Jersey Shore or overly pale skin as if they've been drained of all blood. Digital noise reduction seems to have been applied very heavily, and I almost believe that this transfer was taken from an interlaced source and then deinterlaced, because I occasionally saw some noticeable ghosting. However, at least MGM encoded Helen and its trailer with anamorphic enhancement - something one can't say about Auntie Roo, which is letterboxed inside a 4:3 frame. Quite inexcusable if you ask me. However, other than the lack of 16:9 enhancement, the transfer is pleasing - flaws pop up here and there, but it definitely looks like a new progressive transfer rather than Helen's interlaced-converted-to-progressive transfer, digital noise reduction doesn't seem to have been applied so much, and the color palette definitely looks more natural and even.

My final complaint is the cover - one of the main problems with Helen's release is that pretty much every piece of promotional artwork gave away the ""shock"" ending. Why make that same mistake on the DVD cover? While I don't imagine many people who buy this will be those who haven't already seen it, it's still not a very good idea to give away the ending on a DVD cover, film poster, etc.

I feel kind of rotten for complaining since we're lucky MGM was willing to put these films onto DVD at all - they weren't major critical or commercial successes upon release and haven't exactly developed the massive cult followings of films like Mommie Dearest, but you'd still think MGM would have attempted a better presentation, as well as a less spoiler-heavy DVD cover. However, even with knowing the ending, Helen is still a fun and campy ride, and Auntie Roo is also a delight. And you can't beat getting two movies for such a low price - many places are selling this for five or seven dollars. Both perfect for Halloween or any night you're in the mood for some good camp.",1287273600,16,2892,4.776

1726871,4,B000068TPG,"These films are latter entries in the Henry Farrell/Robert Aldrich initiated series of Grande-Dame Guignol films that began with ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane"". These films employed mature aged actresses in great psychological horror tales replete with black-humour and camp flourishes.
As a successor to Bette Davis, Winters has a strong grasp of the melodramatic style of both films and imbues her characters with an honest psychological core while cutting loose with the emotionally heightened acting. She is by turns empathetic, hysterical and horrible.
The most comedic and satirical of the two outings is ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" - which anyone who has ever dealt with stage mothers will chortle at. Here, Debbie Reynolds also gets to shine as Winters's charming but doomed obsession. The way the gothic feel and mounting tension is underscored by showbiz-satire makes this film an extraordinary and riveting concoction.
The gothic is ramped up, with less comedy, in the second feature - ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo"" - a modern day grim fairytale in which Wnters stars as a tragic and pathetic figure whose delusions lead to madness. Having lost her own daughter - she kidnaps another - along with her troublesome brother who believes that he and his sibling have stumbled into Hansel and Gretel - and casts Roo as the witch.
Both films are great fun - not on par with ""Baby Jane"" - but great entries in a thrilling midnight movie program.",1250899200,,1451,5.05

It is delightfully gruesome in some places, and full of intreging twists and turns.  Shelly Winters is excellent as usual, and Debbie Renalds gives a performance that might susprise those who remember her from the sugary roles she had performed eariler.  All in all a well crafted effort.",1224201600,,540,4.8478260869565215
1726875,5,B000068TPG,"In 1972, I became an instant fan of Shelly Winters who starred in the blockbuster disaster movie ""The Poseidon Adventure.""  I adored her as ""the fat Mrs. Rosen"" who saves Reverend Scott from drowning even though she suffers a deadly heart attack in the process.  Around the same time period as ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" Winters also starred in two psychological horror movies, ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?,"" in which she portrays two talented women who experience mental breakdowns that lead to psychotic, murderous behavior.  Both were set in the Depression era and both were directed by Curtis Harrington; he also directed ""How Awful About Allan,"" starring Anthony Hopkins of ""Psycho"" fame.

  ""What's the Matter With Helen"" is the masterpiece of this double feature.  Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters are two friends who operate a dance studio; they are bound together by a trial in which their sons are convicted of brutally murdering a young woman and are imprisoned for life.  A disgruntled relationship of the victim slices Winters' hand and makes threatening phone calls.  The two women open up a dance studio in Hollywood but the stalker finds them and the nightmare begins afresh.  Furthermore, Reynolds begins accusing Winters of trying to sabotage her relationship with a rich man (Dennis Weaver of ""McCloud."")  Meanwhile, Winter's sordid past begins slowly catching up with her until her mind snaps.  This film is an enjoyable psychological horror slasher that has elements of ""Psycho.""

  Winters is the title character in ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo.""  Consider it to be a bonus film.  It moves much slower than ""What's the Mater With Helen?"" and has a very low body count.  Every Christmas, the children from an orphanage visit Auntie Roo for dinner, games, presents and a sleepover.  Winters decides to kidnap a young girl, Katy, who resembles her dead daughter.  I never understood why Auntie Roo didn't offer to adopt her.  Katy's brother, Christopher (famous child actor Mark Lester of ""Oliver"" and ""What the Peeper Saw""), believes Winters is a witch and comes looking for his sister.  With its large house, s&eacute;ances, a mummified corpse, and a secret room, ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo"" would be appreciated by fans of gothic horror.

  This double feature has given me a new respect for Shelley Winters.  She was very convincing at portraying the psychologically disturbed.  MGM has done a great job, as always, on restoring these rare films; the audio and video are superb.  They would delight all fans of gothic horror and fans of the late Shelley Winters.  I will always miss her.",1218240000,4,2639,5.072093023255814

At times, Shelly Winters chews the scenery (and we love her for it) -- but it's Debbie Reynolds who truly shines in What's the Matter With Helen, definitely the better of the two movies.

What's the Matter With Helen features great costumes, sets, music and dance. So, if you are a fan of the Busby Berkley movies of the 1930's or big Hollywood musicals of any era, this DVD belongs in your collection!

1726878,5,B000068TPG,"Going along the lines of question titles like ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"", ""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" is campy, macabre delight at its very, very best.  ""Helen"" was written by Henry Farrell who less than 10 years earlier penned the script for ""Baby Jane"" and ""Hush, Hush Sweet Charlotte"" (Bette Davis movies) and ""Helen"" is along that vein......set in the 1930's with two female stars at odds with one another.  Debbie Reynolds is great in the film, but Winters is simply amazing.  I remember seeing the trailer for this film on TV in 1971 when the film was released and seeing Shelley WInters playing that piano with that ""crazy look"" on her face gave me the willies.  It is a picture that is first-class in every sense of the word.  ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo"" was made in England and it shows.  But it is still great fun nonetheless, as a take-off on Hansel and Gretl with Winters playing the evil witch who holds two children captive.  It is indeed suspenseful and fun to watch at the same time.  Winters again gives a tour-de-force performance.  The DVDs are perfectly remastered, especially ""Helen"" whose colors leap out from the screen at you.  A great midnight double feature that is not to be missed!  This one is well worth the money.

""Whoever Slew ...?""  Movie: ****  DVD Quality: *****  DVD Extras: ***

Here's a supremely entertaining double feature sure to please mystery, horror, and suspense fans.  Both movies include top-notch casts; lavish art direction and set decorations; great costumes; are effectively edited; and are expertly directed by Curtis Harrington.  In ""What's the Matter ...?"", Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters star as the mothers of two convicted murderers who move to Hollywood circa 1934 to start their lives over.  However, it soon becomes apparent that someone connected with their pasts has pursued them and is out for revenge ... or could it be that one of them is cracking up?  Guessing at the solution is great fun, and in addition to masterful performances by Reynolds and Winters, the film also includes solid work by Dennis Weaver as Reynolds' wealthy beau, the wonderfully acidic Agnes Moorehead as a religious charlatan, and a character actor named Micheal MacLiammour in a wickedly funny turn that calls to mind a deranged version of Sydney Greenstreet in ""The Maltese Falcon"".  In ""Whoever Slew ...?"", Shelley Winters returns in the role of a grieving American mother who opens her English home to a group of orphaned and destitute children for the Christmas holiday.  Already a bit unbalanced, she becomes obsessed with one little girl who reminds her of her dead daughter; the girl's older brother (Mark Lester) becomes convinced that Winters is the real life incarnation of the witch from ""Hansel and Gretel"" and intends them harm.  Soon enough the crazed Winters and the crafty Lester are engaged in a deadly game of cat and mouse ... but which is the cat and which is the mouse?  The cast also features Sir Ralph Richardson, Oscar-winner Hugh Griffith (""Ben-Hur""), and the delightfully droll Rosalie Crutchley (housekeeper Mrs. Dudley from the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"") as the sour head of the local orphanage.

The MGM ""Midnite Movies"" DVD features excellent video and audio transfers of each film, both of which are presented in their original widescreen aspect ratios.  The only extras included are the Original Theatrical Trailers for each film, not such a disappointment when you stop to consider that you're getting two great little ""B"" films for the price of one.  Highly recommended to fans of the genre and to all those who admirer the various highly talented cast members.",1105056000,7,2477,5.089108910891089
