1353581,5,B00004U1FB,"""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"" is a film that explores and tries to explain some very profound things. Who are we? What makes us do the things we do? Is human behavior really predictable?

 These questions in the hands of another filmmaker, say Ingmar Bergman or Andrei Tarkovsky, could have been turned into a somber chamber piece that most audiences members would describe as ""bleak"". But, in the hands of French filmmaker Alain Resnais we have a film that is at times joyous and carefree. The movie blends elements of drama and comedy so effortlessly we sit and wonder why can't more films be like this.

 Gerard Depardieu, Nicole Garcia and Roger Pierre star as the three leads characters whose lives will intertwine. As we see of the story of their lives, the soundtrack plays Prof. Henri Laborit (who also appears in the film as himself) as he explains human behavior. We then immediately get the connection. These characters are really pawns that we be used to take on greater dimension. It isn't so much their story we are watching, but instead our story.

 Rene Ragueneau (Deparddieu) grew up on a farm, and pretty much had his life planned out for himself. His father wouldn't to give him and his brother the farm after he dies. One day Rene stands firm and tells his father he is not going to follow in his footsteps. Rene has other plans for his future.

 Jean Le Gall (Pierre) is running for Prime Minister. He comes from a wealthy family, they even have their own island. Which is where Jean was born and spent most of his childhood. Jean is married with two children, but is having an affair. And he even leaves his family for the other women.

 That other woman is Janine Garnier (Garcia) a young actress who grew up as a member of the young Communist club. Her parents never wanted her to become an actress but Janine was determined to follow her dreams.

 ""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"" is not just about human behavior. I also felt the film explored elements of the effect art plays on our lives. Rene loves to watch movies with Jean Gabin. Janine is an actress. Through-out the film Resnais inserts clips from various movies that correspond to the characters emotion. Does life imitate art or art imitate life?

 And as for the title, all three characters speak of an uncle from America. But the uncle is never shown. Perhaps there never really was an uncle. America is suppose to represent an idea. A place of freedom. An escape.

 The film was written by Laborit and Jean Gruault, who worked several times with other great French directors. Namely Francois Truffaut on such titles as ""Jules and Jim"", ""The Wild Child"", and ""Two English Girls"". He also worked with Godard on one of his best films, ""Les Carabiniers"".

 For those unfamiliar with Alain Resnais, he was at one time a highly experiemental filmmaker and part of the French New Wave with titles ""Hiroshima, mon amour"" and ""Last Year at Marienbed"". ""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"" would find Resnais playing around with story structure again. And many feel it was the best work he did since 1967's ""The War Is Over"".

 In the end ""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"" is a movie that makes us laugh and think. It never takes the subject matter too serious. The film never becomes a lecture, yet it is thought provoking.

 Bottom-line: One of Alain Resnais best films. An ambitious films that doesn't over reach. A thought-provoking, highly entertaining piece of work from a great director.",1155254400,6,3430,4.710217755443886
1353582,5,B00004U1FB,"Fascinating, off-beat piece of filmmaking, brimming with intelligence rarely found in movies. Three storylines are traced and eventually come together, and involve a harried businessman (Gerard Depardieu), a politician/writer (Roger Pierre), and a single-play actress (Nicole Garcia); while these three stories unfold, director Alain Resnais intersplices an on-going lecture by a psychologist expounding on his theories of behavior. These theories have to do with the way people behave toward each other, mainly through learned societal traits, and how those behaviors must be counter-balanced by the more instinctive patterns inside of us, especially when it comes to the dominance of others. Resnais is brilliant in the way he combines the lecture with the unfolding lives of the three protagonists. The only mis-step I felt was the last minute of the movie, which shows burned-out buildings and makes a social statement not congruent with the rest of the picture. But other than that, it's a terrific movie.",1139270400,3,1010,5.52258064516129
1353583,4,B00004U1FB,"Resnais' penchant for film as cognitive experience first and foremost here comes to the fore, although emotion is certainly on display as well. The three main characters of the film--an actress turned fashion industry stylist (Nicole Garcia), a media executive (Roger Pierre), and a textile middle manager (Gerard Depardieu)--all undergo changes in their lives that intertwine with the theories of human behavior put forth by Professor Henri Laborit, a famed French psychologist and scientist, who plays himself in the film.

Bearing in mind that the film was made in 1980 and that psychological theory has advanced significantly since then--largely founded on one after another breakthroughs in neurobiology/neurophysiology--this is nevertheless an entertaining piece of cinema whose theme is really how we respond to external circumstances--specifically, those that could potentially be very stressful.

For some people, a specific circumstance will be manageable; for others, it will be tremendously stressful. In this film, all three main characters respond to various experiences as very stressful ones, and consequently exhibit behaviors reflecting that: attempted suicide, psychosomatic illness, emotional outbursts. Laborit comments on the reason for this stress, which is primarily the inability to dominate (i.e., control) a situation. Regardless of new discoveries in neurophysiology, his statement is absolutely true, and Resnais fuses Laborit's voiceover discussion with interrelated events in the lives of the three main characters that illustrate the scientist's words.

Once in a while, Resnais gives human characters the heads of white lab rats to wittily capture Laborit's points (not for long; just a few seconds or so). Yet in spite of this visual cleverness, the dexterity of the lead actors embodying the emotional intensity they experience given certain changes in circumstance is truly skillful.

What's also interesting is that, early on, two of the three characters profess their love of past French film stars--in particular, Jean Marais and Jean Gabin. When each of these two (the Nicole Garcia character and the Gerard Depardieu character) are confronted with these changes in circumstance, Resnais cuts to a snippet of a scene from a film starring Marais (for Garcia) or Gabin (for Depardieu) in which the viewer can easily tell the emotion experienced by the older actor. This is, again, a clever cinematic device that adds to the film's richness.

Rated one of the best films of the 1980s by numerous film critics, Mon Oncle D'Amerique is a substantial piece of work that bears a number of viewings. It's easy to see why the critics voted this way.

Highly recommended.",1125014400,12,2701,5.51207729468599
1353584,5,B00004U1FB,"I haven't seen 'Smoking and Non-Smoking' and not that singing film he did recently, but otherwise I'm pretty well informed about Resnais and amongst his other work I rank this film as being his best.
It lacks many of the 'arty' touches, that Resnais otherwise and most regrettfully endulges in. This one tells it to you straight - most people live lives that resembles what rats do in captivity or otherwise. The comparison is most amusing but there is a very serious side to it as well. In the end Resnais states: ""As long as we do not realize that we use the cortex of our brains chiefly in order to dominant others, then nothing can change."" Power'full' (powerless really, since directed against power) words indeed.
People break their necks in order to fit in or make a career, which in truth is as rediculous as when Stan Laurel speaks of it in that wonderful short ""Their First Mistake"". When will this madness of competition between people cease in order to leave room for a competition directed towards your own ability to enhance your consciousness instead? When will competition for competitions sake alone cease, a competition which does not even care about what it is competing about, as, for instance, present competition of market economy, which is just a competition about the 'skills' of cheating one another? That is the question and Resnais doesn't have the answer but at least he poses the question.",980553600,9,1418,4.815573770491803
1353585,3,B00004U1FB,"*Mon Oncle d'Amerique* is a smoothly crafted, occasionally funny, but ultimately rather thin  exploration of the theories of behavioral psychologist Henri Laborit. Juxtaposing interviews with Laborit that feel like lectures with fictional scenes illustrating his theories, it all feels more than a touch diagrammatic. Laborit's ideas allow Resnais to explore his familiar interests in time and memory, but the film never escapes an air of cute pointlessness. The idea of mixing didactic material with fictional constructions is certainly intriguing, but this example of it isn't much more than a promising sketch.
Though certainly not ""sketchy"" or ""unfinished."" With the possible exception of the rather tepid *Je t'aime, Je t'aime,* Resnais seems incapable of making a film that isn't polished to the nines. Once again we're treated to the smooth camera moves of *Marienbad,* the artful editing of *Stavisky* and *Hiroshima, mon amour,* the lovely, delicate shots of the seaside first seen in *Muriel.* Although New Yorker's transfer is never much better than adequate (and would be improved considerably by being presented in a widescreen aspect ratio), it's good enough to prove to any doubters Resnais's consummate technical finesse.
Unfortunately, the film also supports the criticism frequently leveled against the director, that in the pursuit of exquisite form, he abandons all interest in character. I don't agree with this criticism. (Even if I did, I don't know why anyone feels comfortable dismissing ""mere"" formal perfection as if it were an everyday occurrence.) Nonetheless, with Laborit quietly intoning every few minutes, it's far too obvious that the characters are being pushed this way and that to fit his theories, walking through a demonstration rather than living convincing lives.
Maybe the film needs a bit more skepticism. There are sardonic touches at the edges. For example, when one character high on the bureaucratic ladder arrives at work, everyone in the hall he passes makes a point of shaking his hand. We realize he's fallen when he arrives and everyone looks away from him. There's nothing that undercuts Laborit's basic thesis, however. If Resnais felt as playful with the ideas as he does with the characters (he occasionally has them acting out their aggressions dressed in rat costume, for example), if he weren't so impressed and convinced by them, the film would have more spark. Instead, *Mon Oncle d'Amerique* is a neatly turned experiment, defined and limited by the validity of Laborit's theories.",978998400,7,2543,5.3734335839598995
1353586,4,B00004U1FB,"Finally!  An affordable New Yorker home release!  One of Alain Resnais' more accessible - and funny - films, ""Mon Oncle d'Amerique"" is also one of his last to find an American distributor.  The transfer is less than scintillating, with a picture earning maybe a 2 or a 3 (5 being the highest rating), and the sound getting a 2 or lower.  But New Yorker has ""enhanced"" the subtitles, making them yellow and enormous.  Since this is a talkative movie, the subtitles often threaten to subsume the entire picture.  But until Criterion deigns to remaster it (with optional subtitles), this is the best we could ask for.",975974400,7,614,4.745283018867925

7923391,5,B00004U1FB,"I couldn't help but feel, as a subtext this film explores White people's obsessions with Blacks. Perhaps they should be afraid of them. They will certainly never win a struggle for dominance with them.

This is a great film, even without being, perhaps, at least at times, subtly creepy, and being quite so at the end. The late Roger Ebert noted that it is a fine film in itself, outside of a psychology professor who speaks directly to the audience, and the scenes from old films that occasionally mirror the action of the modern actors onscreen. These cut-ins certainly make the film more interesting, and more educational, perhaps even more poignant. Were those scenes taken from old movies, or were modern actors being filmed in an old black and white and perhaps silent film style? I would guess these were real films from another age, although, in at least one cut-in, it looks like an actor in the film appears in the old reel?

There was an odd point towards the end of the film, where the politician's mistress, or the mistress he rejects, appears in a position of power, seeming to be the boss of the textile managers, manager. It came quite suddenly and this wasn't explained. It did provide (her being passed over in favor of the original wife) an explanation for her sympathy towards the textile manager. It may have been some kind of female-guilt, placed into the movie. That's something I'm not sure I've ever noticed before, living in the USA, a fictional program promoting female-guilt.

I think this film subtly delves into politics. The filmmakers seem to suggest that 'free trade' and the compromises of 'the high-tech global economy' are harmful to people. It is at least within the realm of possibility there is also criticism being cast upon the larger reality of industrialization.

Personally, I feel this is a great film, even if it does become somewhat exploitative towards the end. Even the subtitles work. They almost make the film seem interactive.",1487376000,,1978,4.84319526627219
7923392,5,B00004U1FB,"Brilliant. Not only entertaining, but entertaining for the brain. I finished this movie knowing more than I did before. Why can't we have movies like this in the U.S. instead of paeans to ignorance, or philosophical discussions that are resolved by a punch in the mouth, or a loaded gun? This was a grand-prize winning movie, but isn't on Netflix. I had to buy the DVD. It was worth it.",1408406400,,386,4.5285714285714285

7923394,5,B00004U1FB,"Winner of the 1980 foreign film award, this didactic film, by Alain, Renais, is based on case studies of the French physician, psychologist, behavioral scientist, writer and philosopher, Henri Laborit, who plays himself in the movie. It uses the stories of three conventional French social climbers to illustrate his theories on evolutionary psychology and the relationship between the self, the workplace and society. The movie appealed to me because it takes the form of a series of dramatic essays about three highly motivated, social striving, but extremely mixed-up persons - sort of a prototype of the typical American Yuppy.

The movie has the feel of a CIA behavioral specialist explaining to his staff how the world of people in the workplace actually, work. In particular it shows how people defer to the pressures of higher and unseen office powers and forces. They do so primarily by inhibiting their primal urges -- redirecting them inward in order to avoid disapproval, save their pride, garner respect and popularity, honor and most of all to protect their livelihood and means of making a living.

Ren Ragueneau (Grard Depardieu), plays the role of a hapless, unimpressive fellow who leaves the farm to seek his fortune in the city. He makes steady progress until he begins to lose the unfamiliar game of office politics; and then unaccountably he loses favor with his boss and mentor who unceremoniously ships him off to the office's equivalent of Siberia. His status declines even further from there on. Being a farm boy, he is completely unprepared for this demotion in status, but being a civilized man, does not fight back. Instead, he develops an ulcer and his health steadily declines.

Similar challenges and negative consequences expressed as physical illnesses befall the other characters in the movie. They too occur in ways befitting their respective personalities and stations in life.

Laboit's point seems to be that societal adjustments in behavior in the work place amount to subtle but insidious forms of social control; that, while operating mostly in the background (in the subconscious and at the emotional and nerve level), eventually become tightly connected to, woven into, and physically wired to the human emotional structure. When they do, the two then continue to evolve in tandem, so much so that the individual personality and even physical well-being is redefined around the dependency on the powers and forces at work: That is, on how one is viewed within the work place; i.e., obedience to work rules, performances reviews, societal and organizational approval, friendships, winning in office politics, etc. Without realizing it this all amounts to a reorganization of ones complete emotional structure and make up, including his personality. And they are continually modified with each turn of the wheel in the process.

I believe this is a thought-provoking and valuable movie because it gets at the psychological under brush that we all know exist in the workplace, but it is under brush that rarely rises to the level of open discussion. I know of no American movies that even remotely get at these kinds of issues, even though, arguably Laboit's theories, apply more appropriately to the American workplace than they do to the European. Five stars.",1327363200,,3302,5.164485981308411
7923395,1,B00004U1FB,"Advances in neuroscience have made this film's weird mix of behaviorism, Freudianism and Foucault laughably obsolete. The parts where the director actually places giant rat heads on the actors to make his points are unbearably over the top.

More importantly, the film is unwatchable due to its intense animal cruelty. The film shows - live and in real-time - rats and animals being killed. In several scenes, you actually see live rats being electroshocked, writhing in pain. One disgusting experiment shows a rat being helplessly shocked repeatedly as if fruitlessly scampers around its cage to escape, attempting to climb the walls. Its contorted face and twisting body reveal the pain it feels. Finally unable to escape constant pain it helplessly lays on the floor, closes its eyes and stops moving. It truly appears to die.

I wasn't told of the level of animal pain and torture this movie holds. It's repulsive. I could care less about the cinematographic or supposed intellectual value of this film. It is flat-out evil to inflict such pain and to ask people to watch it. Quite a few times, we had to pause the film and turn away. It is truly that disturbing.

I cannot recommend this film, and would give it zero stars if possible.",1308182400,4,1240,4.867298578199052
7923396,1,B00004U1FB,"well....I am certainly in the minority here, but I did NOT like this movie--I do like movies that experiment with narrative structure and I like French movies in general, especially those of Louis Malle....I even admired Last Year at Marienbad....but Mon Oncle was so flat, so uninspiring, so OBVIOUS that I had to turn it off...ok, rats in cage..wow! Now that is original!! Wish I thought of that..actually the scenes sickened me, being an animal lover...the 3 stories were not terribly original, the acting was so-so, and I really found it hard to care for anyone in the film....I had the same feeling after watching My Night at Maud's....just a shrug of indifference, even anger at being so blatantly manipulated into ""appreciating"" the film...anyway,  go watch Le Trou  or  Wages of Fear! See a TRUE classic!!!..Scottyb",1294012800,5,823,5.036764705882353
7923397,5,B00004U1FB,"This movie has something of everything: witty humor, depth, and craft. The characters are developed well enough to elicit sympathy even while serving as similes for rats in cages. The conceit of the deepest level of the film is clearly articulated by the narrative of Henri Laborit, the non-fictional psychological theorist on whose ideas the movie expounds.

But it is the craft that fascinated me the most. Like the great filmmaker Antonioni, every frame counts; every detail is emblematic for something either already stated or portending, from beginning to end. It's like having a built-in Criterion Edition: by the end everything has been replayed just enough to ""get it"" entirely, yet the details are either complex, interesting or just fun enough to make it worth watching many times.",1268438400,,791,5.1796875

7923399,3,B00004U1FB,"I'm not usually that big a fan of Resnais' films, but this dissection of middle class France circa 1980 is quite engaging. The movie intertwines three stories, loosely connected: the story of a civil servant, that of a middle manager in a textile firm (Gerard Depardieu, in the most interesting segment) and that of an actress (Nicole Garcia, the least interesting one). The stories are commented by biologist Henri Laborit, who elaborates on how we respond to external circumstances in modern society and at one point compares the reactions of the characters to the pressures of society to those of rats in a laboratory. (The constant references to actors in French classical cinema is less interesting, as cinephilia seems to be a particular French obsession). Laborit's theories might be outdated or naive, but they make a funny counterpoint to the action. I came out of the movie with the idea of modern capitalist society as a pressure cooker to those who want to play high in the game - nothing new, but it's well illustrated in the film. And to those of us old enough to remember the late seventies and early eighties, is fun to see back the clothes, the cars, etc., that people use back then on the screen.",1198540800,2,1214,4.758293838862559
