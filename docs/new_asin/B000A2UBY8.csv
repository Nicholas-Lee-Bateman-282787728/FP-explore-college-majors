2351726,3,B000A2UBY8,"This had the making of a great anime, the storyline was great, the action was great, the characters were great, but for some very un-great reason the story is shot from an upskirt angle... No not just a little bit, a lot.. like as if the camera is stuck to multiple chicks knees just looking up. It didn't ruin this for me, but it's hard to sit down and watch what could have been a great anime, but is not because of some odd hentia upskirting director fetish. The producers must not have had much faith in their work. 5starts - 2 for the pantie shots. and they weren't even sexy, kinda just funny, then really annoying",1235433600,4,620,4.3076923076923075

2351729,3,B000A2UBY8,"This anime is a female James Bond-ish kind of affair.

I actually thought the story was good enough that all the fan service didn't bother me at all.

The panty shots are great... and are placed strategically to seem as though it is the best camera angle to demonstrate the situation... Like a panty shot facing up while the character is looking or reaching for something high... It is reaching on the part of the artists but it wasn't insulting, and certainly didn't hurt the story.

Some of the panty shots could make great posters to advertise this.

In the end the characters and story are defined well enough that you don't mind owning this one.

Not the best anime but certainly not the most horrible.

It is interesting and I would buy it again, after having seen it.",1207180800,2,774,4.532374100719425
2351730,5,B000A2UBY8,"Najica Blitz Tatics is a spy anime with a lot of action and girls with very short skirts, Action + Short skirts= a lot of panty shots. Well aside from that it has a good story and is worth checking out.",1186185600,2,202,3.951219512195122
2351731,5,B000A2UBY8,The anime in this series is really good. It is like watching a feminine James Bond series. No bloodshed here because she uses plastic bullets and knocks out her opponents. The ending leaves you guessing a little is it real or a dream?,1176508800,,234,4.465116279069767
2351732,3,B000A2UBY8,"I'm not sure why he loves white panty so much, but he loves indeed, he may have a certain reason =P

This anime is 'hommage' of AIKa, and this was JPN TV series. In Japan, erotic anime cannot be broadcasted, therefore I was surprised to watch this. (AIKa was sold-anime.) I heard, creators in Studio Fantasia thought so too, its very interesting (@_@)

If also you love white panty, please watch this and wait new 3 episodes of 'AIKa R-16FVIRGIN MISSION' =D",1168300800,3,457,4.560975609756097
2351733,5,B000A2UBY8,"First let me just say I'm glad they made a box set collection with episode 1 all the way to the final. I'm tired of anime box sets that have only one disc in it, this one has 3.

On to the show, if your an individual who likes a strong female lead, & lots and lots of brief nudity, then by all means you'll really like Najica Blitz. By day Najica works for a cosmetic firm, CRI. By night, she's a top notch spy that can hold her own (BUT NOT AS GOOD AS A MAN).

The first four episodes Disc 1 pretty much lays the foundation for the series & later episodes. In the first episode (Mission 001), Najica rescues a young girl, only to find out she is a ""Hummarite"" & becomes Najica's partner at the behest of her superiors. Together, Najica & ""Lila"" (ZZZ) go after various villions, recover other Hummarites & Najica schools Lila about life, & it's do's and don'ts.

I'm telling you this series has nothing but no-stopping action I mean WOW!",1149638400,5,937,4.223463687150838
2351734,4,B000A2UBY8,"Upon first picking up Najica: Blitz Tatics, I was very skeptic to pick it up. I had heard of all the panty shots, excessive lesbian situations, and repetition of the episodes. Still though, I bought it solely on the expectation of it being a one time show and it forever gathering dust among my anime collection. I was actually very surprised by the anime.

Focusing on Najica Hiragi, a majorly successful representative of a perfume manufacturing company, she has the undercover job working for a secretive firm. How she recieves her missions: a single red rose.

The series begins with a recovery mission as you get you first look into what the anime series is like and how the characters are protrayed. You cannot help but like Najica. Her goodwill nature and cheeky way of dealing with sexual references to her being a female spy either gets your grinning or laughing your head off. During the anime, she is portrayed as a genuinly strong willed and independant woman.

Soon, you get introduced to Leila. As the true nature of her being is exposed, Najica is forced to come to terms with what love and independance really is. Throughout the anime, every episode takes on the message of independant thinking and if machines can honestly make a life for themselves without a master.

Much like Steven Speilberg's ""A.I."", Najica Blitz Tatics confronts it in a much more fun and spy way. While the series could of been taken much more seriously, it is a fun addition to your anime collection. Just be sure you do not have any teens under the age of 16 watch it if they are squirmy with sexual situations and lesbian encounters.",1135036800,26,1627,4.698245614035088
8072551,3,B000A2UBY8,Plenty of fan service for me but this remind me of aika,1515888000,,55,3.6666666666666665
8072552,4,B000A2UBY8,"""Najica Blitz Tactics"" is a really good story.  There's lots of action, there's character development, and there's fan service.  Lots and lots of fan service.  This is the only time I can think of when I've deducted a star for excess panty shots.  They actually distract from that really good story.  The characters can evoke your sympathy, and Lila overcomes Najica's initial skepticism, eventually becoming a real partner and friend.

Most of the 12 episodes are quite good.  Two, or maybe three, are a bit weaker than the rest, but that's probably inevitable in any series.  At the end, you're left wondering how life will be for Lila, but hopefully it will be happy.  A longer series or a sequel would well received, I think.",1467676800,,729,4.768

8072556,4,B000A2UBY8,"The show follows the line of a perfume representative who is also a secret agent.  She gets teamed up with an android that she rescues and the majority of the rest of the series is spent hunting down other androids.  There's one episode where there target is human, but otherwise it's mostly the same thing with just a different backdrop and different target.  It's not bad, but there aren't that many truly memorable moments.

There are panties; there are a lot of panties.  Apparently every woman in this universe likes to wear the same white cotton panties.  It was kind of strange after a while that there was no color or variety.  It's not like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Colorful/dp/B0007SL2MK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Colorful</a>&nbsp;which had a similar proclivity for showing female undergarments (that series was based almost entirely on that concept) where things were different color or design.  I personally found it got kind of boring in the missions to keep having it put in quite so obviously and then always the as the same thing; if they're going to do that at least toss in a little variety from time to time.  If you're looking for any nudity, Najica is never naked, though kind of disturbingly the childlike android is topless at one point.

That's more or less the show in a nutshell.  It's a fairly entertaining spy drama with an overall story that is done pretty well over the span of the episodes, with a bit of repeating action, and extremely obvious fan service.  I purchased the set because it was on sale and I didn't have any place I could rent it first.  I've watched it a couple of times over the years and don't regret the purchase.",1354060800,3,1716,4.978947368421053
8072557,3,B000A2UBY8,"This may be a review where the title says it all.  Najica Blitz tactics is by no means a terrible, awful, horrible, or painful anime to sit through but it certainly may not be something you want to pick up and take home to put on the shelf.  I will gladly state that this is an amusing anime that can be watched once without any grief and you won't feel as if you have wasted your time.  It is first and foremost the epitome of a fan service anime which isn't necessarily bad if you're not bothered by that.  In fact if you are looking for a fan service heavy anime that has some plot and decent character design this may end up being a four star series in your opinion.

There is action in Najica, quite a bit of it.  Every episode has at least ten (and often more) individuals who end up getting their ""just desserts"" which leads to the viewer getting just the right view of their panties.  This ends up becoming incredibly comedic, I found myself paying more attention to the inventive ways that the artists managed to find positions for characters to fall over so that we can see up their skirt.  This adds to the entertainment factor greatly.

That out of the way, Najica Blitz tactics isn't without plot and could have been a fabulous anime if there had been more time put into that end of the series.  It starts out very promisingly but it is very clear later in the series with the constant repitition of storyline that someone, somewhere, forgot where this was all going.  That doesn't make it horrid, it can just be annoying.

The start of the series, with the fact that Najica is not just a fantastic perfume creator but a secret agent is intriguing.  The storyline between Lila and Najica is at times very touching and while it isn't distinct (see series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Burst-Angel-The-Complete-Collection-includes-OVA-Blu-ray/dp/B002FOQXX2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Burst Angel: The Complete Collection (includes OVA) [Blu-ray</a>] for women/girls in close, caring situations) it is refreshing.  As the storyline progresses - as stated - this begins to fall away into the fan service action that you can expect in this series.  That is the real shame of this show, because it could have incorporated both and been a comedic, touching, and intriguing anime.  The characters are rather well developed for the sort of series that Najica Blitz Tactics is, the soundtrack is pretty good though it can become repititious as well, and the artwork isn't bad at all.

I do believe you won't be wasting your time watching this show if you approach it from the angle of Saturday morning Cartoons. It's amusing, hilarious at times, has some emotional value, some thought provoking moments, and if nothing else can provide boredom replay value.  It certainly isn't something I would suggest you invest in if it isn't on sale, but it isn't a series to toss in the bin.",1279065600,9,2933,4.867203219315895
8072558,5,B000A2UBY8,"If you can get over the very obvious ""fanservice"" (after all, the show is produced by the same studio that did ""Agent Aika,"" a show with even MORE fanservice than Najica Blitz Tactics), you immediately notice how surprisingly _good_ the storytelling is, especially how Najica warmed to using Lila as a partner over the series.

In sum total, it's actually got better storytelling than the vast majority of anime series I've seen in the recent past. And it helps that there's really great jazz score to heighten the sense of action in this series, given it the feel more appropriate to a good spy movie. How come most modern anime producers can't come up with such smartly-written shows?",1277164800,2,686,4.813559322033898
8072559,5,B000A2UBY8,"I personally believe this collection deserves at least four stars.  To make a great story mediocre because of panty shots fails to grant credit to the creators who deserve it.  The sexual undertones are not degrading and are meant to target a more mature audience.  The story line focuses on two sexy secret agents employed to handle high level secret missions.  The girls can handle themselves quite well.  One of them, Leila, being cybernetic gives a few brief insights into her incredible strength and precision while maintaining a delicate and lady/child like persona.  It is fun to watch Najica, as she gets more familiar with her new apprentice partners potential, instructing her to take on more seemingly impossible tasks that she manages gracefully.  Though Leila's ability to manage simple daily tasks renders her clumsy and useless at first, she is a fast learner and grows to be a good secret agent, one that Najica after a rocky start grows quite fond of.  Najica quickly learns that a few of the right words will get Leila to do exactly what she needs her to do.  I personally love this anime.  The story line is great and, being a male, the panty shots are a bonus.",1258156800,,1180,4.740196078431373
