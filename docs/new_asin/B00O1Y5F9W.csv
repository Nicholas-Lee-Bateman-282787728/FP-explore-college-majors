I am very impressed with the beauty of the production, the highest quality of dancing, and a few very special ballet dancers. First, the production. The undertaking necessary to create the special effects on stage (not on film - this was filmed live) is incredible. The story closely follows the famous book, with a prelude that introduces the characters in Alice's life before she fell down the rabbit hole. Each of the real characters then morphs into a ""Wonderland"" character in Alice's dream.

Alice is beautifully played by Lauren Cuthbertson, a true actress-dancer. Her looks of delight are from within. I was especially impressed with Steven McRae, who plays the Mad Hatter, or in this version, the Mad Tapper. He is a brilliant tap artist, and this talent was put to use by the equally brilliant choreographer, Christopher Wheeldon. Wheeldon is inventive, imaginative, he manages large groups on stage with the same ease he brings to Alice's solos. Luckily, he has given McRae a solo in the final scene to display his diabolical tapping. As Wheeldon explains in the ""extra"", the Mad Hatter has a diabolical aspect, he is truly mad. Another standout is Zenaida Yanovsky, a British dancer who is quite tall, and she puts her height to full use in a hilarious spoof of the Rose Adagio, where she dances with four short dancers who are terrified of losing their heads, a cutting motion she employs in abundance.

I  have a few cavils. There are episodes that linger too long and episodes that seem to have been truncated. The version of the Mad Hatter's Tea Party on the DVD Special Edition I bought is quite different in details from the YouTube version. Important moments have been skipped, and other moments played up. But the scene is still highly effective and a highlight of the ballet.

I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD, especially the Special Edition, with a documentary on Being Alice, describing how the ballet was conceived and formed. It is a tour de force!",1430006400,3,2048,4.8262108262108265
