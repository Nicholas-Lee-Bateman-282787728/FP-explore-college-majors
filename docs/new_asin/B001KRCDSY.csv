3669264,5,B001KRCDSY,"After reading reviews on here, I was going to just buy the original which was what I wanted. However, the combo pack is only a few bucks more so I got it. It was worth it. New version isn't going to be a favorite but was an ok and entertaining watch, and I still got the Haley Mills version I wanted. I'm glad to add these to my live action collection!",1344729600,,352,3.971830985915493
3669265,3,B001KRCDSY,"Three stars - that's all the DVD is getting and all three are for the original version starring Hayley Mills, Dean Jones and Dorothy Provine. The 1997 remake is not worth the celluloid it was originally printed on and Disney should be embarassed for even releasing it. I broke down and bought it as it was a good price and had both on the same disc - great idea I thought! I had never seen the remake and thought it would be great to own - was I mistaken - but that's enough of that film, that really belongs with DC in his little box.

It also surprises me (and it goes for a lof of Disney films) that they couldn't release the original in a proper widscreen format, like the remake. I was once told that it's for 'the kids' as they don't 'understand' widescreen.

Now, taking the original movie into consideration, as I mentioned above, it get a full 3 out of 3 stars from me. I grew up on Disney films (especially the live action ones) and this one holds a special memory for me : it was the first movie I was alowed to go to, on my own, with a couple of friends - no parents along. I immediately fell in love with Hayley Mills! The cast is great and a good fast moving script by Bill Walsh and The Gordons(who wrote the original book).

This came at the height of the Disney comedies and should be in everyone collection, but if you can find it on it's own - buy it that way.",1334534400,5,1379,4.118959107806692
3669266,5,B001KRCDSY,"I love this movie, both the original and the remake. I grew up with the Haley Mill's version and now, at the end of each school year, I show it to my students and they LOVE it!! The remake is also special to me because I was able to watch it filmed in Edgefield, SC, and was able to meet some of the actors/actresses. Too cool. It's great to have them both on one DVD.",1302652800,2,368,3.92
3669267,5,B001KRCDSY,"I ordered this movie set for my two-year-old daughter for Christmas.  She is absolutely obsessed with kitties, so we bought her a whole bunch of kitty themed items.  I have to say that I actually bought this one with my own enjoyment in mind!  I have always loved the old Dean Jones movies, so I was glad to finally buy a movie that I thought she would like to watch because it has a really cute cat in it and yet it has a storyline that's a little more exciting for the adult in me :)  The original TDC looks and sounds great.  Haven't watched the newer one because I'm so attached to the original but I  bet it's great, too.",1265241600,2,626,4.132231404958677
3669268,3,B001KRCDSY,"This 3 star review is misleading. I haven't seen this new collection,yet. I'm hoping that Disney fixed the 1965 version which they previously released fullscreen. I hope it's now letterboxed. It probably isn't, but I can hope, can't I? At least each movie is on a seperate disc. And the collection is at a resonable price.",1233187200,2,322,4.767857142857143

3669280,5,B001KRCDSY,"Both versions of that darn cat are great. In the original version, the cat steals the show. The antics of that cat are enough without a story or other actors. The story is good  and the actors are good but the cat is great. In the second version Christina Ricci is incredible as always and the supporting actors are great. This cat is good but not spectacular. In both movies there has been a kidnapping and the victim tries to get help by putting their watch around the cat's neck. Great comedy and cat antics ensue as they try to find where the kidnappers have put the victim. Great fun.",1444953600,,589,4.3545454545454545

3669282,5,B001KRCDSY,This film offers a fun mix. The original movie is a perfect blend of comedy along with mystery. The remake involves a younger group on the case bringing an updated  twist offering more interest to kids of various ages. In grand Disney style this double feature is a family film staple in my collection.,1439424000,,302,4.592592592592593
