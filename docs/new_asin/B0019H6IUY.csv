8274020,5,B0019H6IUY,"It is a shame this series has yet to see a BluRay release as I no longer collect DVD's, because I would love to repurchase and own it once again, especially if it had a dub. I recall checking out the 1980 film first and it was quite good, but this 2008 tv iterations blows that out of the water. If you are looking for an anime that delivers on Sci-Fi, it's got that. If you are looking for something that delivers on Space Opera, it's got that. If you are looking for engaging characters and top notch character development, it's got that. And if you are looking for memorable music and animation, it's also got that. I personally believe many anime cannot actually be deemed perfect as they do not have enough to warrant remembering/recollecting, as well as 90% of the time don't have characters you not only can empathize with but get to see them actually age and change over time. But even 5 years later I still vividly recall everything about Toward The Terra, and it is great to see the journey that Jomy goes through from young naive boy to mature leader, even support characters are not left in the dark as they too develop. And just like with Gundam 0079's Char I love how Keith Anyan while seemingly a villain on the outside is really not that bad a person and you don't want to see the heroes triumph over him. Toward The Terra is an amazing piece of fiction you need to experience before you die, and there still are not enough series as deep as this (and if it were to be dubbed then please cast Crispin Freeman as Keith Anyan and have Mary Elizabeth Mcglynn direct/script the dub).",1437091200,,1595,4.391891891891892

8274022,5,B0019H6IUY,"I started watching this series after seeing sarja20's AMV ""A Falling Star * [Terra E]"" at a convention a year or so ago (it's beautiful but it has spoilers so be warned!). I love the art and the story, while sometimes awkward and oddly subbed, is compelling.

This is based on a manga that was published from 1977-80 and was later made into a 1980 animated film. The anime is a bit updated from the appearance of either of the story's previous incarnations and is not a continuation of either. Rather, it starts from the beginning of the story with some alterations. At it's heart, this is honestly ""X-Men"" in space with a bit of ""Ender's Game"" thrown in the mix if every X-Man was Jean Grey and the main character was the Phoenix, incredibly post-apocalyptic Earth but taking place instead in a 'utopia' after the fact. The title comes from the fact that the Mu (or mutant psychics) have a dream of reaching the long-lost Earth.

I cannot honestly say why I like this series as much as I do. It gets pretty corny at times and somewhat grating (although that might be the fault of whoever was picked to sub this, since it really is not written all that well - there aren't any typos or anything, but the speech is a bit awkward at times). The script is at least partially to blame. So much of the series revolves around shots of different characters as they say or think either of the primary protagonists' names while not actually doing anything to advance the plot or deal with the situation at hand and a lot of characters do some pretty stupid things in this series that don't really come to anything. There's also some weird time skips that are a bit jarring at first. But if you give them time, it's easy to understand why they made them. I'm also unsure about some of the plot, especially near the end. It's kind of weird. The character design is also pretty good and I like a lot of the art that's used, but this series also suffers from the skirts in enclosed spaceship phenomenon for women, which got irritating.

This series has many sad moments (be prepared to be sniffly), but there are also many heart-warming and sweet moments. This was also made in 2007, so there's a lot of neat animation to look at. The stuff some of the characters do in space is pretty cool, especially when the main character, Jomy, is there. If you like ""Wolf's Rain"", ""X-Men"", ""Galaxy Railways"", ""Starship Operators"" or ""Code Geass"", this might be the right anime for you and you should try checking out the manga AFTER. It's old but okay. Also watch that AMV if you really cannot decide.

Part 1 contains episodes 1-8. Part 2 contains 9-16 and Part 3 contains 17-24. Each 'Part' is really two regular sized black DVD cases held together in a thin box cover, and each DVD case has one disc, so there are 6 discs total. I have not checked out the extras yet, but the DVDs work fine. The animation and sound quality are good and the subs, for what they are, are pretty good.",1393200000,,2962,4.449355432780847
8274023,5,B0019H6IUY,"This is an excellent series if you like space opera, Orwellian scifi, and old school anime (before fan service dumbed most of it into kiddie fair). The original manga was based loosely on Slan, a really old scifi novel.  Actually, it's quite dark (in that pessimistic Orwellian way). The quality, pacing, and consistency of the series is strong; it's not an action anime, but a scifi drama.

The character development is good and there are no pointless filler episodes; Terra hits the ground running and doesn't let up. There is none of the typical girl-boy romance in this anime; it's pure social commentary and character development. In fact, you'll probably wish they made it a little longer.

There's also *no dubbing*, only subtitles, which might turn some off. Personally, I can't stand dubs, so this is no loss.",1243036800,2,818,4.913043478260869
8274024,4,B0019H6IUY,"""Toward the Terra"" is an animated science fiction TV series from Japan, expertly directed by Osamu Yamazaki (""Yotoden,"" ""Tokyo Revelation""), that explores the common anime theme of outsiders trying to escape a strictly controlled society and thrive on their own. In this case it's a future setting involving Earth's far-flung space colonies, all operated by the principles of the SD System (Superior Domination), and the outsiders are young people identified as ""Mu"" (presumably short for mutant) who display extraordinary psychic abilities. The first volume (episodes 1-4) focuses on a young man, Jomy Marcus Shin, who is plucked from his designated ""adult examination"" by a Mu leader, Soldier Blue, and installed, somewhat reluctantly, aboard the spaceship home of a renegade Mu community. Over the course of these episodes, he has to reckon with his identity and his fate and it's not easy for him, especially when the military forces of his home nation-state, Ataraxia, locate the Mu ship, a 300-year-old spacecraft that's been refitted, and attack it.

The second volume introduces a set of new characters, including young Seki Ray Shiroe, a boy who displays Mu powers but refuses to leave his home, and Keith Anyan, an elite student, but one with no memory of his past. Shiroe and Keith wind up as rivals aboard Educational Station E-1077, a space station designed as an academy for the brightest students who've passed their adult examination. Through it all, the Mu are watching and monitoring, eager to find and recruit kindred souls to join their cause, just as the colony rulers keep on the lookout for the Mu ship.

This is what filmed science fiction should look and feel like. There is some suspense and action, but not enough to distract from a storyline concerned with ideas about the nature of humanity and what transformations humanity will go through when separated by great distances from its home planet. How will society develop? How will society treat children with special abilities? These are intriguing concepts and have informed some of the best Japanese animated science fiction over the years. (Jomy himself recalls Amuro Ray, the ""New Type"" hero of the first ""Mobile Suit Gundam"" series.) The characters are consistently interesting and we look forward to learning what will happen to them in future episodes.

As far as the animation goes, I'd most like to single out the character design which updates the retro style employed in the original manga and pays only a subtle tribute to it. The characters are all given detailed design features and are clearly differentiated from each other. The backgrounds are all meticulously done and we get a strong feel of what this future society looks and feels like. The interiors of the Mu ship include some highly imaginative, almost mystical design touches to set the atmosphere of the ship apart from the regimented society which has driven them away.

I enjoyed this volume a great deal and think it compares well with many of Japan's best anime sci-fi TV series of the past, even if it makes no significant stylistic inroads of its own. The manga it's based on, published from 1977-80, boasts a lot more visual experimentation and should be read and appreciated on its own. The TV series expands on the manga, including, for instance, a section on young Shiroe's backstory in episode 5, an addition I found particularly helpful.

Keiko Takemiya, creator of the manga, is identified as the first female writer-artist to tackle the science fiction genre in Japanese manga and she's interviewed in two segments included as extras in this DVD set. It's an eye-opening interview and she cites Robert A. Heinlein (""Starship Troopers"") and Shotaro Ishinomori (""Cyborg 009"") as prominent influences. I saw parallels with Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation"" series as well.

An earlier anime movie, TOWARD THE TERRA (1980), was based on the manga and is a masterwork in its own right, both visually and dramatically, even if it performs a lot of compression to fit the whole story into 112 minutes. The anime series, which allows the story to unfold at its own pace, is a perfect complement to the movie. Fans of this story should seek out and enjoy all three versions: manga, movie, and TV anime.",1232150400,3,4257,5.022662889518414
8274025,5,B0019H6IUY,"What started as an interesting science fiction drama about a big brother society with annoying telepaths will very quickly develop into a deep and moving mind trip. The overall feel to this series, brought on largely by the characters, made this series very hard to walk away from. Every episode had left me just enough information to have to see more and the cliffhanger at the end of this set has the second set already poised to move to the top of my review pile when it arrives. Very highly recommended.",1221091200,,507,4.582417582417582
8274026,5,B0019H6IUY,"Everyone who knows and loves the manga will find this series just as appealing as the books because the anime is not just a boring retelling, but also has tiny changes to the plot which keep you interested, even if you know the story already. The animation is good and with a nice, up-to-day character design that stays true to the books in the same time. I especially loved the Soundtrack of this series. It is very beautiful, often quite dramatic, but that's how I like it.

Sadly, the DVDs are the absolut minimal release you can give to an anime series. There is no English Dub, there is no booklet and, except for a textless opening and a nice interview with creator Takemiya Keiko, there's nothing else on it. There even is a typo at the back of the DVDs if you want to be nitpicky.

But still, despite the let downs about this set, I have to say I'm very greatful this series gets released here at all and I'm looking foreward to the next set! It's one of the better anime out there. Even if you don't know the manga, give it a try!",1219881600,3,1039,4.269035532994923
