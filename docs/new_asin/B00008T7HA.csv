Check out one of the sexier BratPacker movies, and tell me you don't play ""spot-the-earlier-work-of-bigger-stars..."" Cute boy-meets-girl/fish-outta-water/redemptive-loner/look-how-much-we-learned,-aren't-we-noble? mash-ups. A better-than-most example of cheesetastic 80's mindcandy. Which is a GOOD thing! Watch as part of a Sixteen Candles/Ferris Bueller...Breakfast Club/Oxford Blues Double Feature Weekend and tell me you don't sink back to a lighter, easier place. 80's Rule, lol!",1175817600,3,552,6.680555555555555
1861944,4,B00008T7HA,"Isn't hard to be the new guy in town?  Or in another country?  That is how it was for Nick DeAngelo as he tried to fit in at Oxford.  He worked at a casino in Las Vegas and he saw a beautiful woman that he noticed was famous.  He grew hopelessly in love with this woman and vowed to follow her to Oxford.  However, he soon learned that at Oxford, he was not part of the ""in"" crowd any longer.  People were some of the worst snobs that Nick had ever known.  But, he worked hard to make some friends including an American woman named Rona.  And he was part of the rowing team.

I think someone should see this movie if they ever felt like they were snobbed in high school.  Also, Rob Lowe's last scene during the credits where he puts on different clothes is really silly and great.",1099267200,7,780,4.105960264900662

1861987,5,B00008T7HA,"This is one of those blast from the past movies. I loved the setting, Oxford University. The buildings and scenes in the town and along the river were wonderful. The acting by Rob Lowe and Ali Sheedy isn't award winning, but it gets you through the plot. The focus is on rowing and that really makes the film worth seeing. Rowing at the British universities is huge and especially at Oxford and Cambridge. Very few films have really addressed it but this movie does a fairly good job of it, surprisingly.

The film quality is old compared to the newer films, but this was made over 30 years ago, so that's to be expected. I was glad to find it on Amazon and at this price. Usually these old films aren't for rent anymore, only for sale, so it was a nice surprise to find it here for 2.99. If you're a fan of rowing and especially of rowing at Oxford, you'll like this film. I highly recommend it.",1434326400,,896,4.3017751479289945

1862010,5,B00008T7HA,I have always enjoyed this movie since it first came out on TV.  I just had to wait until it was available on DVD.  I was glad to sind it while searching on Amazon.

1862031,2,B00008T7HA,OMG quick review! I must have drunken too much orange julius' the movie sucked! I think because I was a star struck boy crazy young girl in the 80s the movie was amazing! Rob lowe  chad lowe briefly and set in England where the love of my life was from! a hot british singer. sorry side track.....I swear I fell asleep 3 times and I had just awoken from a long nights sleep. Now just looking at how staged faked stiff a whole host of adjectives he is on that stupid poster! I should have ran! no nostalgia said go for it! well I could have said no. john Hughes pictures still hold up today. oh what a waste of money. I am still a bit star struck\man crazy but im a woman now. WHO should Have Known Better! oh sorry England its not your fault!,1370131200,,742,4.082191780821918

1862045,4,B00008T7HA,"A very young Rob Lowe, plying his trade as a lothario, heads to England to meet a Royal who has caught his wandering eye.  His method is to hack his school grades in order to secure a spot in the prestigious school where his target attends.  The usual ""ugly American"" stuff...learning to fit in and become a gentleman instead of a self-centered boor is played to the hilt by a surprisingly good cast.  As one who loves rowing, that was the main attraction to the movie in my case, and rowing was interwoven throughout.  This was sort of a ""Tom Brown's School Days"" set in modern day.",1346889600,,583,4.420560747663552
1862046,3,B00008T7HA,"seeing the formal 'cafeteria' requirements for the robes, long tables close together and food scenes reminded me of the first Harry Potter film, wth?, all the professors full of themselves in grandeur of the ancient campus etc., and the race between Harvard and Oxford was highlighted in the Social Network but the Harvard guys wore the Oxford jackets, go fig...  Rob Lowe, a Dego, hmmmm, blue eyes, aqualine nose, thin lips, don't think so...and who thought that baby blue/pink striped scarf was hot looking???  impressed with his welding abilities and the blowtorch he packed from Vegas to repair the sportscar lol, and was surprised to know that some of the scenes were actually filmed at Oxford... really kewl perspective of campus life, dorms, countryside, etc., love 80s films and want to see this one again, and glean other gems of higher learning from this quirky script.",1332028800,,879,5.013698630136986
1862047,5,B00008T7HA,"Made me want to go to Oxford, be on the rowing team and meet Lady Chatterly, alas I was too lazy so I just rented Lady Chatterly's Lovers over and over instead and got an education from the School of Life. Indirectly this movie lead me to other interests like english humor, Benny Hill, Dr. Who and a fascination with England in general. There was also a Mini Cooper in the first scenes that Rob drives his T-bird? thru the narrow streets of Oxford and I'm on my 3rd Mini Cooper.
Hard to believe that the chick (cougar) Rob's character fools around with in Vegas, is later a star trek Captin Janeway, with the same scratchy throat voice.",1299888000,,637,4.406779661016949

The quality doesn't compare with high definition movies that are made today, but it was still good quality. Age has caught up with me though. I thought this was such a great movie in my mid-twenties. Not as entertaining now. Not bad - I would just rate it average.
SO ... I am very pleased with the company and their service. The movie itself is ok.",1296777600,,453,4.341176470588235
1862049,5,B00008T7HA,"WOW!? Literally everything about this is awful. Ghetto bootleg-style 'archive' DVD transfer and packaging. Crap acting. Ludicrous story. The entire thing is so bad...

...that it's good. HOWEVER: it's only good if you, like me, are an aficianado of stupid 80s movies. I'm willing to look past the bad-everything to have the satisfaction of being able to play something on the DVD that reminds me fondly of high school sleepovers and my bygone sports days on the rowing team. That last part sounds made up, but it's true. Give in, people. Give in to Rob Lowe's cowboy boots and gelled hair.",1273276800,,589,4.8316831683168315

1862053,5,B00008T7HA,"For years I waited for this 1984 movie to be released on DVD and when it finally was made available ""on demand"" at Amazon.com I hesitated purchasing it. I heard some of those do not play well. Not my copy of Oxford Blues.

Growing up in a small British Commonwealth country I yearned for college education in England and Cambridge was my dream college. (Some thirty years later I entered graduate school in Chicago).

I rented Oxford Blues shortly after it played in theatres in the early 1980s. I loved it, and kept a VHS copy. Grad school went smoothly but there were days when I simply tired of evening studies after work and felt like throwing in the towel. Each time I felt that way I interrupted my studies and popped the VHS into the player to see glorious Oxford University, the rowing team, the debating society, the revered latin-speaking professor and, oh yes, the adventurous Nick De Angelo. And after each viewing I was motivated all over to pursue my heart's desire.

Oxford Blues is 5 stars all the way. It's great to be young!",1265068800,4,1042,4.561497326203209
1862054,4,B00008T7HA,"My wife was curious why ""Oxford Blues"" was included with Warners Archive collection.  She thought these films were reserved for old black-and-whites and not for something she had such a vivid recall for.  I hate to break it to her but this flick is 25 years old and Rob Lowe is no longer gracing the cover of ""Tiger Beat"".  When this film came out I was in college and naturally I didn't see it because I was dismissive of this narcissistic pretty boy.  Most of the so-called Brat Pack drew the ire of elitists notably Lowe and Judd Nelson, but that's another story.  Lowe got my grudging respect after an inspired guest hosting gig on ""Saturday Night Live"".  Two sketches stood out, a wicked impersonation of Arsenio Hall (in white face no less) and another called ""Helmet Head"".  Lowe also did a memorable turn in ""Wayne's World"" a few years later.  As for the film it's a breezy entertainment about a self-absorbed Vegas stud(Lowe) who enrolls at Oxford to show up the upper crust and land the most desirable woman in the U.K., Lady Victoria(Amanda Pays) in the process learns about himself and the importance of teamwork.  Lowe has a certain smarmy charm and Pays and Ally Sheedy represent the polar opposites of cuteness.  There's a certain cool factor here with the presence of Michael Gough, Alfred the Butler in ""Batman"", and Aubrey Morris, Mr. Deltoid from ""A Clockwork Orange"" in the cast.  This is a lightweight affair but not bad.",1249344000,13,1442,4.705179282868526

Rob Lowe did come across as a very convincing brash American whose behavior does not sit well with the natives. He was very pushy, even interfering with a couple's relationship. You knew right from the start that he and Lady Victoria would never end up as a couple. Amanda Pays was lovely in the role, she was from an upper class family but she was very down to earth and I enjoyed watching Lowe's attempts to win her over. But the performance I enjoyed the most was Ally Sheedy's, Rona. She was quite wonderful. I also knew right from the start that she would end up winning Lowe.",1499644800,,688,4.259541984732825
