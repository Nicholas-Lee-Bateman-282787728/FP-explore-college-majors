7961411,4,B000065U29,"I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I can appreciate and respect Barbara Hammer's approach in telling this very unique story. In ""History Lessons"" (from 2000), Barbara Hammer gives us a riveting and even humorous account of the secret lives/history of ""gay women"" during the tumultuous decades of the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's, 60's, and 70's, of the 20th Century. Anyone who grew up in the US during the Cold War era, remembers the state-induced propaganda via news-reels/films that all school children were subjected to. These so-called ""instructional films"", basically demonized everyone/anything that did not subscribe to the puritanical and sanitized ""American way of life"". So it's not surprising for Barbara Hammer to take the very same images/message and turn it on its head. She playfully juxtaposes them, to convey the opposite of the original meaning. And as a filmmaker, she does an excellent and eloquent job in providing a wide array of erotic images of women, via a collage/montage effect that, is free of the sexual-symbolization/exploitation that frankly, most men would have given them. Evidently, Barbara Hammer is a feminist/lesbian artist and, that's precisely my point. Her perspective and point of view is vital in this context and analysis and, the reason to why this film-documentary is important. Not to be missed! Open-minded people will best appreciate the argument and thesis, this dedicated artist is making. The DVD picture and sound quality, by First Run Features is very good. NTSC, English (no subtitles), extras, NR 66 mins. (BTW: I'm looking forward to discovering more of Barbara Hammer's films.)

Final Analysis:

The divisions/separations in our world (be it: racial, national, religious, sexual, etc.), are by design: to limit and control the better part of humankind. I believe our differences have more common ground than we think and, what unites us all as human-beings is even deeper still. My perspective on life is mainly from a spiritual one and, for that reason I can never take a plainly socio-political/material view of humanity and the world, without accounting for the other.

Love and Peace,

7961412,2,B000065U29,"""History Lessons"" is primarily a montage of archival footage that has little or no discernible connection to gay women, optically reprocessed and edited to vaguely imply lesbianism.  The endless repetitions of the same lab-aged and otherwise altered footage make this downright tedious at spots.  Lots of spots.

I first saw ""History Lessons"" at a film festival, accompanied by a talk by director Barbara Hammer.  She is a very good speaker and obviously a creative, witty, intelligent person.  I like some of her other films, but this one is too rambling and far too long for what it is.

Recently, I rewatched bits of the film on DVD.  Although the director's ironic, wink-and-nudge approach to some of the footage is clearer on second viewing, I just don't see the point behind this film which is clearly the result of  a very time-consuming editing process.",1077148800,,861,4.972027972027972
