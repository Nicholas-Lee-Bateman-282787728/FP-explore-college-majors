8318027,5,B001LGFFJ8,A cinematic tour de force! Like Ben Hur meets The God of Cookery meets Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. The Oscar-worthy costumes are amazing and Billy Dee Williams even makes a cameo.,1503964800,,182,4.71875
8318028,5,B001LGFFJ8,This is the very best vegetable based animated retelling of the Oedipus story I've ever seen. You'll believe that a potato cannot fly.,1503964800,,134,4.869565217391305
8318029,5,B001LGFFJ8,"i got this as a promo when it was first released. I didn't know what to think of it when I heard about it, but it's really great. It's animated with fruits & vegetables, but that description doesn't do it justice. The voice actors and dialogue are hilarious and the casting is incredible, lost of unsaid jokes there. I wish there was more available from this filmmaker, but if there is, it's hard to find. Try it, you'll love it!",1503964800,,429,4.375
