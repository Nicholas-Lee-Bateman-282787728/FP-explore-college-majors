I'd watch it over and over and over. Then I found it here and at such affordable price there was no way I wasn't getting it! Well, as fate would have it, it arrived on my birthday!! I watched it for the first time in 18 years and couldn't stop smiling the entire time. Thank you for allowing me to revisit a very dear part of my childhood!",1489968000,,504,3.950980392156863
