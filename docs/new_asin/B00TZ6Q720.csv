7026196,5,B00TZ6Q720,"William H. Macy turns in another stellar performance as the head honcho of the Dial-A-Prayer service. Brittany Snow does an admirable job of playing the ""lost"" young lady in need of a reason to live a better life, who finds her calling at the Dial-A-Prayer service.

The movie takes several unexpected turns, which add to the substance of the film.

They really should have left out the tobacco-drug use, as would be the case for any movie.

Still, an excellent film for 16 and over (because of a few bits of language).",1430179200,7,519,4.619565217391305

7026223,5,B00TZ6Q720,"This is one of those small movies that is a character study and shows real growth of character.  Brittany Snow does a great job of showing how a lost character can find strength from others even when they are not pre disposed to finding this help.  She exhibits guilt for what was driving her and a recognition of what had lead her down the wrong path.  Her regret is mixed with depression and so she seems unable to cope with her past and her present, but other people help show her a mechanism for coping.  Because the character is too old It is not strictly  a coming of age movie,  but because of the immaturity of her actions, the movie shares many similarities with the coming-of- age genre.  Bill Macy (as the main character's boss)  and Glenn Headley  (as the main character's mother) are notable in their constrained performances.  This movie should have a wider distribution and I highly recommend it.",1448323200,,911,4.60248447204969

I would recommend watching this movie.",1445817600,,159,4.517241379310345
7026227,2,B00TZ6Q720,"The trailer suggested the story was going somewhere else. I'm not even sure that the film resolves all the loose ends. There is not a huge transformation of the main character and what we know about her is very very vague. So vague beginning, vague development and vague ending. Ultimately the film is well executed in terms of craft but the story lacks a strong backbone to keep the audience hooked.",1441065600,,400,4.647887323943662

7026229,1,B00TZ6Q720,"Written by her husband: The movie is pessimistic. The name of Jesus is used in vain. Very vulgar words are used. Sexual act is depicted on several occasions. The young lady, her young man, her parents, and others are totally without hope. No one is told the way to hope through Jesus. The dad is a horrible example not giving attention to wife or daughter.  The young man says that ""she"" saved him, and that is the most salvation in the movie.  She told her dad that she wanted to feel something through and through so she helped vandalize the church; she never found ""I am the Way, the Truth and the Life"" and he didn't help her with that.  The dial a prayer people do a good job but are made to look somewhat silly. The cover looked like a ""Christian"" movie in which a person might start out with problems and find some true solutions by giving their heart and life to Jesus, but she never did in this movie.  The high point was the end when she and the fellow ended up at a town named ""Somewhere"", and that is the most somewhere they found after their search to be somewhere.",1439596800,5,1078,4.269607843137255

7026231,2,B00TZ6Q720,"If you thought you were renting/buying a Christian movie, you have made an egregious error.
The philosophical/worldview ""bent"" of this movie is existential, at best, and secular humanistic, at worst.  Essentially, the only ""God"" in this movie is represented in the purely comical and satirical supporting cast that comprises the ""Dial-A-Prayer"" office crew and the ""God"" of the delusional/idealistic mother of the protagonist, Cora.  They are portrayed as either shallow, pretentious, or pollyanna in their respective faiths.  The protagonist, Cora, is exalted as the one who finds the proper perspective on life in the end.  The message that I received from the movie is that ""you have no real need for any god, except you,"" which diametrically opposes the worldview that I hold.  You be the judge.",1437955200,11,799,5.25984251968504

I would not take a church group to watch it, or let children watch it, because there is pretty bad words in it! In all I would buy this movie again!

8703432,1,B00TZ6Q720,"Unlike the title implies, this is not a Christian movie. It's riddled with profanity and promotes fornication. Definitely NOT a family movie. Also the writer neglected to mention that prayer often falls flat if you don't have a functioning relationship with God. Also answered prayers come from God, not by the will or power of the person saying the prayer.

Side Note: Who God is is not connected to how badly people in your life treat you (Christian or non-Christian) or on how off the wall or inapt some people are. God is God and people are people.",1519430400,,552,4.63265306122449
