The film follows a stray cat as he wanders south from NYC to North Carolina as he sees three different incidents happen. Great fun! But  one note to a reviewer, why would u expect good effects from a film from  1985? Look for that awsome Police song during Quitters Inc.",958262400,3,356,4.298507462686567

179965,5,0790747693,"Cat's Eye is an awesome 1985 movie based on three Stephen King short stories, two are taken from his ever published (in 1978) collection in book form of some of his short stories called Night Shift.  Those stories Quitters Inc, and The Ledge and are linked with a third story involving a young Drew Barrymore who has appeared as a vision to a stray cat as it was around while events in the first two stories play out.  In the third we learn why it has been summoned.  There's some cool cameo appearances and Stephen King book references throughout this movie as well, such as Cujo, and Christine who early on nearly lethally end the journey for the stray kitty.

The stories are a bit dated as you would expect, surveillance and hidden cameras would probably make Quitters Inc even more believable therefore something to fear today. The film brilliantly uses The Police song Every Breathe You Take, not as a love song like it is often misused as.  All three are simple tales, it's a low budget movie at times the technology at the time stands out such as a horn that doesn't look like it's falling, but overall the film still works. Interestingly in the last story, the background music sounds very similar to the Back to the Future theme. Of course they were both composed by Alan Silvestri so that's understandable.  The feline actor/s certainly can act, as that character more than just carries the film, it makes it brilliant.",1510790400,,1430,4.632411067193676

179971,5,0790747693,"Child actress Drew Barrymore (E.T.) once again stars in this thriller of stories by Stephen King. I like it, although it is a little dated. Still good and always good to see Drew. The last story is the best one in the bunch and low and behold, Ms. Candy Clark (American Graffiti, Blue Thunder, Amityville 3D, The Blob 1988) stars as ""Drew's"" mother. A host of actors of the era also star such as James Woods. You'll recognize the faces.
You will also see a few ""gems"" of Stephen's movies in the beginning, so watch for those. Nice cameos!
The movie looks good on the 4K UHD 55""! If you play it back on an upscaling Bluray player, it will be 2160p and look great even for the year it was released!

179981,5,0790747693,"Easily without question my all time favorite Stephen King film. It centers around a cat who's involved in each of Stephen king's tales for the film. The beginning sets the tone where the cat is walking along minding his business. Then all of a sudden, a St. Bernard rabid dog (Cujo) chases the cat. After almost getting hit running across the street by a Red Plymouth (Christine), the cat eventually eludes the dog ending up in New York City after boarding the back of a truck. The 1st tale is about a man (James Woods) who loves cigarettes but is willing to do whatever it takes to stop. He joins a place recommended by a friend simply known as Quitters Inc. Or more like consequences and repercussions if you don't do what we say. Very sick and twisted plot guaranteed to make any smoker quit immediately. Then after escaping yet again, our cat finds himself in Atlantic City, New Jersey where a man who loves to gamble becomes obsessed with torturing a gentleman he finds out has been sleeping with his wife. The gambler has had the guy kidnapped and framed for having drugs in his car ready to do serious prison time unless he can walk all the way around the hotel building ledge without falling off. Once again, the cat finds a way to escape but not without being a hero aiding the gentleman at harm and the tables turn from there. Finally, the cat makes his very last arrival which is well overdue in Wilmington, North Carolina where he aides Drew Barrymore throughout the night. Throughout each city the cat goes to before arriving at Drew's, he keeps seeing images of her telling him that something is coming for her and he's her only hope for survival. Well, we eventually see why his arrival was so important. A monsterous troll finds its way into the house and vows to take her breath away throughout the night while she's attempting to sleep. That is until General (the name the cat is now given by Barrymore) steps in and changes things for the better. My favorite King film because of the simplicity and originality. A must see for any Stephen King fan that will not disappoint.",1500336000,5,2092,4.551724137931035

It was my favorite as a kid in the 80's, and after not having seen it in AGES it's somehow even better than I remember it being, probably since the first 2 resonate with me more now as an adult as I can see how they might have went over my head a bit as a kid. They are DARK!! The third story is of course the star of the film, and the effects are super impressive for the time! No plot description is needed, if you are here reading this, just get it already, you won't be disappointed!!",1498780800,2,563,3.9473684210526314

180019,4,0790747693,"CAT'S EYE is a highly fun anthology of Stephen King horrors.  I saw this movie as a kid and enjoyed it very much and particularly loved the final story about the troll.  As an adult, I have more of an appreciation for the dark humor of ""Quitters Incorporated"" and ""The Ledge"".  All 3 tales are excellent anthology tales.  And some of the FX in the troll story is still excellent to this day!
Now, about the BLU RAY: The picture quality is VERY GOOD.  This is a nice clean transfer.  It looks very natural and for a film made 30 years ago, this transfer is beyond satisfying.  The Audio quality is good, clear, and consistent.  The only bonus features on this disc are an older commentary with the director and the film's theatrical trailer.  It would have been nice to see a new retrospective featurette on the disc featuring Drew Barrymore, James Woods, and Robert Hays.  But I suppose we can be happy that this great flick is now available on BLU RAY and looks GREAT!",1474934400,,969,4.454545454545454

180022,5,0790747693,"The late, great Roger Ebert's comment on the back of the case for Cat's Eye reads ""A superior Twilight Zone style anthology"" and that is completely true. It ranks with the incredible Trick r Treat, the underrated Tales from the hood and Creepshow. All 3 stories are very solid and well made with excellent special effects with a terrific cast that includes the ever iconic James Woods. Lewis Teague directs the cat superbly just as he did with the St. Bernard in Cujo (who makes a surprise appearance along with Christine). The movie could've done without the silly visions the cat has of Drew Barrymore's character in the first 2 stories and just met her in the last story and I also wish they could've used the actual Police song ""Every breath you take"" instead of a cover version but those are very minor nitpicks. I also think it would've made a better ending if the screen just went black at the end when the cat goes up to sleeping Drew Barrymore's face making the ending ambiguous and eerie instead of the cutesy kid friendly happy ending that's in the film. 1985 was an excellent year for horror films (Fright Night, Stephen King's Silver Bullet, A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, Day of the dead and Return of the living dead). For some strange reason Cat's Eye never gets mentioned with the best of the anthology films but it definitively earns a spot on that list. There's a magic to Cat's Eye that reminds us how special the 70s and 80s were for film, especially horror films. I just wish there were atleast 1 or 2 more stories. Warner has gone above and beyond with the new blu ray transfer because it is excellent. It's a shame horror anthologies are so rare but Cat's Eye is a terrific treat for fans of anthology films. Now only if Paramount would get in gear and release the rest of their Stephen King films to blu ray as well with the fantastic Silver Bullet, The Dead Zone and the entertaining Graveyard Shift.",1474243200,5,1924,4.515759312320917

180063,3,0790747693,"Cats Eye is a pretty good Stephen King anthology film that incorporates several visual nods to his other films/book. There are three stories that make up the film all being tied together with the cat.
The 1st story is Quitters Inc. it deals with a guy that goes to a company that specializes in helping you kick the habit of smoking. To say they have extreme measures of getting you to quit is a understatement. Very good story here.
The 2nd story is the weakest of the bunch and really not that interesting compared to the other two. It's called The Ledge and deals with a mobster who gets revenge on a guy who is sleeping with his wife. However, the tables end up turning on the mobster. It's interesting to note that the 1st two stories come from Kings book, Night Shift while the third was written for the film.
Which is called General and it's the best of the three. It involves the cat, a killer troll and a little girl. Very similar to the Trilogy Of Terror episode Amelia with the Zulu Warrior doll that comes to life. The troll itself is a lot of fun to watch as it fights with the cat and the little girl.
Over all the film is pretty entertaining and lends itself to repeat viewing. Look for all the Stephen Book/film references through out the movie. Some are obvious and some are hidden.",1434758400,,1299,4.371900826446281

I am and have always been a big fan of Stephen King, from the books to the screen and everything in between. So it is no secret that I am a fan of this film. In fact I believe it is one of the most underrated of all the King related films that have been made. This movie featured three different tales all interlocking through a cat, two of which were based on King's short stories from the book ""Night Shift"" while the final was made for the film. The script was written by King himself and directed by Lewis Teague who also helmed the King film ""Cujo"".

Three different stories are connected by a cat that is getting visions of a little girl who needs help. On his way to finding this girl in the final story he comes across two different situations that put him in danger. The first story involves a man who really wants to quit smoking and will go to any length to stop, or is that forced? Then he moves on to meet a few people stuck in a love triangle and the situation they end up in. Finally the cat arrives at his final destination looking for the little girl that has somehow been calling out to him. What he finds may be his biggest test yet.

I have always been a fan of the anthology films and this is one of my favorites. How could it not be with King penning it with two based on short stories that I already loved. The first story ""Quitters Inc."" stars James Woods and is an excellent start to the film. In this story he is trying to quit smoking and goes to a business that specializes in helping with those kinda problems. The thing is if he is caught smoking his wife and daughter will be tormented and punished for it. The punishments would continue to get worse like being put in a shock cage or being raped. He is told that if he continues even after all that then he will be killed. I will not say if he smokes or not but I will mention that I loved the ""Watching You"" scene with the song from The Police.

The second story is just as good with a man wanting to run off with another man's wife and the consequences of that. This story is called ""The ledge"" and I am sure you can guess why, the title refers to the punishment the man must go through. The catch is that if he completes it then he will be forgiven and aloud to live and get the girl. What happens is fun to watch and is a great addition to the film. This brings us to the final story, ""General"". It is called that because that is what the little girl [Drew Barrymore] names the cat when he finally arrives at her home.

Now I am sure most people remember this segment the most since it was the poster and such. This one involves a troll that is after the little girl at night. The problem is that her mother does not want the cat in the house at night. This of course means he cannot protect her. This is probably my favorite of the stories because the cat is the star here.

Also I should point out that since the director did ""Cujo"" it is Cujo that is chasing our feline hero at the beginning of the film. You should also watch for a certain car named Christine to appear in the film as well as other nods to other King works. Also the setting of the final story is the same town that ""Maximum Overdrive"" took place in. those are a little of the things you might notice or hear about on the commentary track that the director does. This is a fun flick that I do recommend to any King or horror fans out there. Every time I watch this it takes me back, I love it.",1382918400,,3461,4.089837997054492

180110,4,0790747693,"I like to think of anthologies as short tales similar to those told around a campfire late at night. Out in the woods, darkness everywhere, with the trees swaying, and people huddled close around a bright and sparking fire. One person will begin telling a tale, something of an urban legend, perhaps a made up story, to frighten the other listeners into scooting that much closer to each other. Some may try to laugh off the willies, yet it is these same people who are also the ones to jump at the abrupt sound of an owl hooting, or a twig snapping, or a frog croaking. Here we have a collection of short stories, one that's older but better than most, penned by King himself when he was still great and grand.
The central theme is that of a cat trying to get to a little girl to rescue her from some strange troll beast thingie. Why? Well..it's never said. How does the cat know to save the kid, or how does the kid know the cat is there to save her, or...? Well, I'm getting ahead of myself in a major way, so I'll just stop here for the time being.

The first tale is called Quitters, Inc., and is about a smoker about to go through sheer hell. Stopping nicotine addiction is hard enough, but Richard Morris seeks help through an organization called,  yep, Quitters Inc. Unfortunately the man who runs the organization is a bit too serious, using torturous tactics to ensure the smoker stays a quitter. After Richard has enrolled in the program, he is told of the 'rules.' The head of the company is affiliated with the mafia and goes completely wacko on a pack of cigarettes. It's apparent this guy needs more than nicotine in his veins to get his head set straight. He informs Mr. Morris that he will be followed every way possible, and that if he sneaks a smoke, they'll know. The consequences for lighting up are dire - wives sent to the 'electric shock room', wives getting a finger cut off, and ultimately death. James Woods stand out as the best here, he's an amazing actor and his character fits this oh so well. This short story is bar none the best of the lot. Music such as ""Every breath you take"" kicks up the deal, it's all very laughable yet incredibly dark and twisted - perfect! The cat is used as an example of something horrid to happen if the smoker starts smoking again, but escapes at the last minute to confront the next situation.

The second story, The Ledge, is about an aging tennis player who has made the mistake of having an affair with a powerful gambling addict. Knowing about the affair, the gambler gives Johnny an ultimatum. If he doesn't follow through with the 'test', he'll be sent to prison for planted drugs in his car, or else killed.  He has to walk around the outside ledge of a 30th floor apartment building. If he doesn't fall to his death, he walks away with the wife and a substantial amount of cash. Of course the sadistic gambler has no intention of letting Johnny win, as he sets up as many obstacles as possible for the poor soul. Let's just say you'll never see pigeons as friendly birds again. The acting is only subpar, and that hurts it slightly. The ending is great, wrapping up yet another entertaining installment. Here the cat has been brought home by the gambler and given the night to stay there. (Of course, prior to this he bets 2000 the cat will be hit when crossing the road)

The last story, The General, is about the cat, who has somehow witnessed all these bizarre instances on his way to save the girl. He is adopted by the small child, Amanda, and attempts to save her from the evil troll monster that comes out of her wall to eat her. The effects of the troll itself were dismal and cheap, further showing the date of the film, but that doesn't matter as it's still fun. This short story made the least sense, and it had less going for it. For one thing, the mother of Amanda, played by Candy Clark, is a complete bitch and got on my nerves. This tale was also the least interesting. Still, it's not bad and has a cute Drew Barrymore when her acting skills were at their best.

The cat deal is never fully explained in the anthology, which is a shame. Apparently a prologue was filmed to explain the reasoning to the audience, but studios deemed it too over the top so it was cut. One of the main problems I've seen expressed about the film is how ludicrous the cat is connected to all, but....well, who the hell cares??

King of course put some nods to his own work in here. The cat runs into a St. Bernard that is the spitting image of Cujo. Actually, it is the same dog that plays the rabid mutt. He also runs into a car, 'Christine'. During Quitters, Inc, the Dead Zone is on TV. In The General, the PMSing mother is reading Pet Cemetery in bed.

Overall this is an amazingly fun, cheesy, dark anthology that fits King's stories. Each one of them induces laughter and chuckles, but also are foreshadowed with a truly slick evil overtone. One of the best anthologies around, if not THE best, this is one that can't be missed.",1379635200,,5002,4.388349514563107

180112,4,0790747693,"Stephen King's Cat's Eye is entertaining... until the final 20 minutes.  Stephen King tries to combine two (or three I suppose) stories together and make an interesting concept but ultimately misses the mark and becomes really confusing.

It begins with a family man with a horrible smoking addiction so he seeks help and finds out the most effective way to give up the horrible habit is by being threatened to do so by a mafia man.  How is this man threatened you're probably wondering?  If he were to sneak a cigarette, the people watching over this smoker (and following every step he takes!) would have to drag the man back to an office room where a torture chamber is hidden behind a wall.  In this torture room is where the man's wife will be forced to jump around like crazy because the floor can produce electrocution-like effects.  Only Stephen King could come up with something so amazingly disturbing!

That's not even the worst part- if the man sneaks a second cigarette, now his wife and kids will be tortured by being raped and have other horrible things done to them.  Wow, I think with these potential situations it'd probably be totally wise to just persevere all the shaking and uncomfortable vibes associated with the addiction of nicotine, haha.

For a while we see the man going about his day the usual day but with the side effects occasionally kicking in concerning what one feels whey they haven't had a cigarette in a while.  Eventually however, the story switches into the man being forced to hang outside a building and walk across a tiny ledge without falling.  This segment is about 15 minutes and pretty good.  Not as good as the cigarette cravings earlier, however.

By the way, while all this is going on (with both mini stories) there's a mysterious cat roaming around wherever the threatened man is going.  This cat is basically serving as the main character though it's not obvious until the end.

After this action-packed segment however, suddenly we experience a BIG change- the final 25 minutes of storytelling involving Drew Barrymore's child character having to deal with a miniature monster coming out of her bedroom wall with a knife and tormenting her while she sleeps.  Strange, huh?  Yes, very strange!  It's a big ""WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED?!?!?"" moment for sure.  I believe saving this particular story for the conclusion was a big mistake because it felt too heroic in a childish kind of way.  This story change is especially unappealing for those that enjoyed the first half and wanted to see a conclusion to the man with the smoking habit.  I sure did, at least.

The biggest problem attempting to combine several of these stories together is that the smoking storyline never reached its full potential.  There was clearly more story to tell involving the possible torturing of the man's wife/children but... it never occurs thanks to the next story coming into the picture.  Pretty disappointing in my opinion.  Perhaps keeping these three tales completely separate would have been a better option.

Still, the concept is original and kept me curious what was going to happen next, so Cat's Eyes is most certainly a movie I recommend watching.  I like how the Police song ""Every Breath You Take"" (MEGA popular song in the mid 80's for those of you who weren't born yet) was a theme throughout the movie thanks to the lyrics relating perfectly to the storyline taking place.  I actually didn't realize how well the lyrics match the story until the film was over!",1364428800,2,3514,4.8019966722129785

180117,4,0790747693,"Stephen King returns to tell three more fiendish tales of terror in CAT'S EYE! A mischievous pussy cat gets wrapped up in a few evil schemes while trying to save a young girl from eminent doom. First, a life-long smoker gets more than he bargained for when he joins Quitters, a company that uses rather persuasive methods of torture to help their victi-- ""customers"" stop smoking. Next, the frisky feline is taken home by a jealous crime boss, who will only spare the life of his wife's lover if he can successfully navigate himself around the ledge of their rooftop penthouse. Finally, the cat runs off to find a new home with a loving little girl. Her mother makes her keep the cat outside, not knowing that an evil little troll is attempting to steal her daughter's soul. Luckily, our hero cat arrives just in time to save the day! Fans will remember director Lewis Teague from his earlier King outing in CUJO, and also from the outstanding 80's creature feature ALLIGATOR. Teague is in fine form once again as he attempts to recapture the success of 1982's CREEPSHOW. The three stories are fun, engaging, and well-balanced, with sharp humor and entertaining performances by James Woods, Alan King, and DUNE's Kenneth McMillan. King fans will also enjoy seeing brief cameos from several of his other novels, including the killer St. Bernard, Cujo, a copy of Pet Semetary, and the red roadster Christine.

180125,4,0790747693,"This DVD is a trilogy of three Stephen King stories.  The stories are titled Quitters Inc., The Ledge and General.
Quitters Inc

This tale is about a man who wants to quit smoking and he goes to a company named Quitters Inc.  They are a coaching company to motivate people and the motivation is very strongly applied.  As he fills out the forms another man has his wife come out in tears and with her shoes off.  The wife starts beating her husband with her shoes.  The manager shows Mr. Morrison (James Woods) a cat in a room being shocked on a metal grid floor and the penalties get worse from there....

The Ledge
The cat gets free and he moves onto a boat to get into New Jersey.  The cat is the basis of a wager where a casino owner, Mr. Cressner (Kenneth McMillian) bets the cat will make it across a busy street in front of the casino.  He wins as the cat makes it and causes a major wreck in the street he just crossed. Cressner takes the cat home as he just made $2,000 on the bet.  The cat at least deservers some milk.

Cressner's wife is having an affair and he has the man kidnapped and tells him that if he can walk around the ledge of his penthouse apartment then he will divorce his wife.  The trial leads to problems and turnabout is fair play.....

The General
The cat gets away again and he rides a train all the way to Wilmington, North Carolina.  There the cat meets a girl, Amanda (Drew Barrymore) who likes him and names him General.  There are other new guests in the home.  The two legged kind about 8 to 12 inches tall with sharp teeth.  The Troll likes the little girl and wants to do her harm and the only thing that can save her is a cat that the mother hates and wants to take to the animal shelter....

This is a good DVD if you like Stephen King's stories.  It is always entertaining to see his imagination come to life on the screen.  I enjoyed the stories but I am a Stephen King freak.

180139,3,0790747693,"As far as 1980's horror anthologies go ""Cat's Eye"" is okay, nowhere near as good as ""Creepshow"", but better than ""Tales from the Darkside: The Movie"". The film features 3 adaptations of Stephen King tales, two of which come from ""The Night Shift"" collection loosely connected by a framing story about a stray cat.

1. - Quitters Inc. This is probably my favorite story found in this collection. James Woods wants to quit smoking, turning to Quitters Inc. to help. Unfortunately Quitters Inc. uses some pretty extreme methods to help folks kick the habit. With a large dose of dark humor, and Alan King as the nefarious head of Quitters Inc. you can't help but chuckle through this first entry.

2. - The Ledge. This is another solid entry as Robert Hays is coerced by his lover's husband to walk around the outside of a casino building when caught trying to run away with the man's wife. There are a few tense moments here or there and it's another fun entry.

3. - The General. This is where the film kind of falls apart for me. Drew Barrymore plays a kid suffering from nightmares and the titular stray cat seems to be the only thing that can make the nightmares stop. This is basically King's version of a ""Goosebumps"" tale, it's strictly for the 13 and under crowd as there are no scares, and the humor found in the earlier entries disappears too.

The good thing about ""Cat's Eye"" is that it's a good way to introduce your kids to Stephen King's tales, consider it a horror film for family.",1256601600,,1495,4.525925925925926

180142,3,0790747693,"As a child, I watched ""Cat's Eye"" without blinking.  From the opening sequence with the smoker to the ending sequence with the troll, it held my attention for over an hour.  As an adult, however, it doesn't do the same.  Don't get me wrong...it's still a good flick, but that's exactly what it is -- a flick.  It's one you might watch on a rainy afternoon when there's nothing else to do or in the middle of the night when sleep just won't come.

With the opening story, I'm not sure why anyone would want to pick up smoking after watching it.  If you knew all of this was going to happen to you and to your family, you'd think twice.  The second story is probably the one that will be skipped most often.  It's not that it's not good, but you can easily anticipate what's going to happen and how it will end.  The last story, however, is the one to watch.  The acting in it isn't all that great, but the story line is amazing.  I'm not so sure why this story wasn't used to make a full-feature film.

The third (the best one of them all) stars Drew Barrymore as a girl who's terrorized by a troll living in her wall.  What holds the three pieces together is a cat (hence the title), which travels from one to the other, and is the hero in the last.  The troll animation is superb.",1209945600,,532,4.28
180144,3,0790747693,"Drew Barrymore in one of her first starring roles isn't exactly a great invitation to watch a movie, but I bought this anyway because it was apparently adapted from a Stephen King work I had never even heard of. Is it any good? Yes and No. All the best parts have nothing to do with Drew, and quite honestly, she didn't even have much to do in the movie.

To call this a `movie' would be incorrect. Its more of a `collection of vignettes'. The film is divided into three broad sections, and each has nothing to do with the other, except for the fact that one single cat plays the observer in all the segments. The cat `sees' Drew ask him for help in the first scene, and he goes through various situations all trying to find her. The final piece of the movie is when the cat finds Drew and is adopted by her. But not so quick! His destiny is finally revealed. Turns out there is an evil goblin that comes out at night in Drews' room to `take away her soul', and the climax is a hilarious fight between the cat and the goblin. No prizes for guessing who wins.

This is by no stretch of the imagination a `horror' film. With all its' early 1980's `special effects', it borders on camp, and really, its quite watchable. The middle of the film sags (it has nothing to do with the cat, instead its all about one man being tortured by another, by making him hang off the edge of a high-rise building) but I really can't hold it against the makers if this was all in the book that Stephen King wrote. Remind me never to read that book though! Ah yes, the first part of the movie has an inane segment where a mans' wife is forcibly tortured unless he quits smoking (??). This sort of bizarre theme might work if handled differently, but here it becomes satire.

And yes, Drew Barrymore acts terribly and is in the film for maybe ten minutes.

It is very well acted and the cinematography is astounding. But I can't give five stars due to an over the top smoking scene in the first segment and the cutting of the prologue at the begining. I would have liked to have seen it, for it explains the cat's motivation. Quitters Inc. was good, The Ledge was the best of the three, and The General was very enjoyable.

Although not realy a comedy and not realy a horror, it's nowhere near his quirkiest.  Sometimes the simple stories are transfered better than others from his literature and suited the theme at the time, to come up with a collection of short stories with a twist.

If nothing else, you have to appreciate the talent of the people who trained the cat(cats?) for a very significant role, especially in the last story.  Using the cat's perilous journey to save a young girl as the anchor to tie the three stories together worked well. The acting was, for the most part, excellent although the young Drew Berrymore didn't show the level of terror you'd expect in her situation.  As a child actor, though, you can forgive that.

180153,3,0790747693,"As with most anthology movies, this 1985 flick is rather uneven regarding the quality of the various stories within.  Scripted by THE modern horror-meister himself, CAT'S EYE (a.k.a. STEPHEN KING'S CAT'S EYE) features adaptations of two of King's previously published short stories and one original tale, all tied together with a feline-centric wraparound.

The first segment, ""Quitter's Inc.,"" is a dark comedy in which a chronic smoker (James Woods) engages the services of an professional firm to help him break his nasty habit, but he doubts his decision when he learns that the organization's CEO (Alan King) is a former Mob boss who utilizes the ""techniques"" of his previous profession to ""help"" current clients.  This is definitely the strongest of the three tales.

Segment two, ""The Ledge,"" again involves an underworld kingpin (Kenneth McMillan), this time one who forces his wife's lover (Robert Hays) to engage in a questionable bet.  Not as clever nor as interesting as the first story, but not too bad either.

""The General,"" the final segment of the trio, is about an abnormally intelligent cat who, despite protests from the mother (Candy Clark), ""adopts"" a family and moves into their rural home.  Unbenknownst to the humans, the feline's raison d'etre is to defend the daughter (Drew Barrymore) from the attacks of a wicked woodland troll who has also claimed squatting rights in the home.  Definitely the weakest of the three stories--and thematically out of step with the other two--though the animatronics FX for the wee creature are kinda cool.

The final segment is also meant to be the climax of the wraparound, but that might be rather unclear to some viewers.  Director Lewis Teague has claimed that the wraparound's prologue was originally longer and made its connection to ""The General"" much more obvious, but the resulting ambiguity was created by studio-enforced cuts beyond Lewis' control.  Pity.  The overall movie might have been more cohesive if studio suits had kept their scissors away from the director's and screenwriter's joint vision.

CAT'S EYE is not the best film based on the works of Stephen King, to be sure, but it is still a well-made and entertaining diversion.  Jack Cardiff's cinematography is excellent, the editing is top-notch, and the pacing of the stories is good.  And director Teague--who earlier directed CUJO (1983), another King adaptation--elicits great performances from most of the cast.  Genre buffs, especially fans of writer King, will enjoy spotting all of the self-referential--and often humorously self-deprecating--in-jokes (which include the killer car Christine and a clip from 1983's THE DEAD ZONE, among others).  Also watch for the very brief appearance of actor Charles S. Dutton in one of his first screen appearances.

The DVD from Warner seems about as low-budget as the film itself, but it still offers a nice digital transfer of the film in anamorphic widescreen.  And unlike a lot of Warner cheapies, there is also an informative feature commentary with director Teague.

The cat finds itself as a test animal at a stop-smoking clinic run by Alan King.  The success of the clinic is not based on psychology or diet, but on extortion and torture.  The cat manages to get away.

As the cat tries to cross a busy Vegas street, he becomes the subject of a bet and winds up in a penthouse suite were a deadly game is to be played out.  James Woods has been having an affair with the penthouse owner's wife.  To protect his life he must follow a ledge all the way around the building.

Finally, the cat manages to reach the home of a young Drew Barrymore where he becomes a pet.  No sooner does he arrive than we find out the girl is being menaced by a creature that lives in her bedroom wall.  Only the cat can save her from the diminutive menace.

While technically an anthology movie, this one works a little better than most.  Following the cat through the stories really is an effective way of tying the separate tales together.  The third tale is the weakest and that is probably from the lack of a strong acting presence like in the first two stories.  But all in all the film works and is entertaining right to the very end scene.  Check it out.",1120694400,,1400,4.12962962962963
180155,4,0790747693,"Stephen King's CAT'S EYE is reminiscent of the seventies anthology movies like TALES THAT WITNESS MADNESS or HOUSE THAT DRIPPED BLOOD.  King's dark humor pervades throughout.  In the opening sequence, the cat is chased by a crazed dog (Cujo) and almost run over by a car (Christine).  The cat's misadventures frame the three stories involved.  In the first, ""Quitters Inc."" the cat finds himself a guinea pig at a weird smoke cessation outfit, run by a sinister Alan King.  James Wood stars as the man who finds out that kicking the habit isn't quite so easy and the repercussions for failure painfully wrought.  The cat escapes from here and ends up the new companion for a weasly gambler who is about to extinguish his wife's tennisboy lover in a most unique fashion.  He makes him walk the five inch ledge of a high rise and offers him everything if he can make it.  Kenneth McMillan is the gleeful gambler and Robert Hays (Airplane) the unfortunate lover.  Tabby once again escapes, however, and ends up with Drew Barrymore and her parents (Candy Clark, James Naughton).  Tabby has to fight a nasty troll in this one.

The movie is well paced and entertaining with good performances especially from Wood and McMillan.  The special effects for an early 80s movie are appropriate and CAT'S EYE emerges as one of King's better film efforts.",1119312000,3,1341,4.782608695652174
180156,5,0790747693,"Three short films in one long film tied up by the perigrination of a cat looking for the girl who is going to adopt it as a pet. The cat will find the girl. The first adventure reveals the obsession of smoking in a society that considers that activity as a quasi-crime. Some people are ready to do anything to quit and the society is also ready to do anything to force the reluctant candidates to quitting to quit. The procedure is to punish the people the smoker loves to make him - in this film it is only men that are concerned, and we do have to question why - quit and stick to his decision. This reveals a society that has privatized such a mission and this mission becomes criminal in its own way, even if the ethical aim is to be considered. To torture innocent people may be effective but it is unethical in all possible ways. The second adventure has to do with betting among high life criminals : the rich who make their dough from all kinds of illegal activities, such as drugs. And what happens when the stake of the bet is the wife of one crook ? Criminal challenges, murder and vengeance. Breath taking and unbearable for people who suffer of vertigo. Funny too in the reversal of the situation from one vengeance to the next. The third story is more humane and dark at the same time. Cats are nice pets but here a mother has a fixation against such an animal and is ready to do anything to get rid of it. But cats are obstinate and children, here a girl, are also very powerfully determined to get their ways. The  Kobold  is absolutely charming in its evilness though I prefer the good  Kobolds  I have met so often in germanic traditions. But its end is definitely Dante-like. There must be a special hell for these vicious and obnoxious beings that only want to hurt and wound if not even kill poor little defenseless children. But cats are definitely not defenseless, far from it. Careful with children : to watch such a film might give them nightmares with many boogeymen in them.

180157,5,0790747693,"Another great anthology from Stephen King (Creepshow)! This time out we get 3 dark stories of the bizarre, all tied together by a cat that's trying to get from NYC to North Carolina to save a girl in distress. QUITTERS INC. is about a poor schmuck (James Woods) who is convinced by a friend to try a new cigarette smoking termination program. What he doesn't know is that the founder was a mafia-type, and that mob tactics are used in order to make people quit their nasty habit! Alan King is perfect as the guy who will utilize any / all methods of persuasion at his disposal to keep his clients honest; including abduction, torture, and bodily mutilation! Next is THE LEDGE, about a washed up tennis pro (Robert Hays) who is given a deadly ultimatum by the mob boss who's tired of him sleeping with his wife. He can either get busted for the heroin that's been planted in the trunk of his car, or walk all the way around the outside of the building on the five inch ledge that's about a hundred feet above the ground! This is an excellent story of twisty revenge. Finally, we have the third segment with a young Drew Barrymore (E.T., Firestarter) as a little girl who has an evil troll living in her bedroom wall. In this one the cat emerges as the hero. Candy Clark (American Graffiti) is exasperating as the mom who thinks the kitty is up to no good and almost keeps it from saving her daughter's life! CAT'S EYE is well done and well worth owning...",1109203200,4,1454,4.408921933085502
180158,4,0790747693,"Much like the Creepshow series, I'm sure there will be a lot of people who argue about which part of the three part Cat's Eye is better.  Though in my opinion the first and third segments of the series are the best, w/the third being my favorite; only the first two segments are realistic, but your self in that situation segments.

The first segment, called Quitters, stars a young James Wood as he tries to break the habit of smoking cigarettes.  He is just arriving at a Quitters facility that uses a bit of an abstract technique to get you to quite.  If you cheat, and smoke a cigarette, someone in your family gets hurt, real bad.  Yeah, a Sopranos type clinic that actually reminded me of an old Tales from the Crypt episode.  However, this is a very well done segment, as I stated above my second favorite.  The cat has little airtime in this segment.

The second segment (The Ledge) stars Robert Hayes as a man who slept w/the wrong guys wife.  A betting man captures Robert Hayes character and tells him he has to walk along an edge all the way around a building.  If he makes it he will be let go w/no harm and a bag full of money, if not, well he falls.  Once again, the cat plays a very small role, and though parts of the scenes are a little sadistic, the drama in this segment is not what I believe it was intended to be.

The third segment, and my favorite (maybe because it's the closest to the Creepshow series) stars Drew Barrymore as a kid who discovers the cat and wants to make it a pet.  The cat is needed because a troll has invaded the house, and lives in the wall.  Only the young Drew Barrymore and the cat know of the intruder.  However, the mother sees the cat as the intruder, and the cause for all the problems.  This is the most exciting episode in my opinion, and made the series worth owning.

In conclusion, this may be a very average movie over all, but has some very cleaver aspects, and some enjoyable scenes.  Definitely a rent before buying type movie, but worth having for all Stephen King collectors.

180159,5,0790747693,"Stephen King ( whom wrote the screenplay for this movie) brings you three terrifying tales of horror done in the ""Creepshow"" style as told from the eyes of a traveling stray cat. The first story "" Quitters Inc."" is about a family man ( James Woods) who just can't stop smoking as he signs up for a program called ""Quitters Inc."" which secretly monitors his smoking habit, the next tale is in Atlantic city called "" The Ledge"" which a tennis player makes a bet with a boss to walk a hotel ledge. Then finally our title cat in "" The General"" must protect a young girl ( Drew Barrymore)from an evil goblin who wants her soul.
Entertaining and well-made collection of comic-book stories with Hitchcock-esque and Twilight Zone-esque tones to them. Good acting and some good special effects for it's time especially the goblin make this worth watching.
Highly recommended if you enjoy the works of Stephen King, Creepshow 1 & 2 and Tales from The Darkside: The Movie.
P.S.: Look for cameo's by Stephen King's other famous characters like "" Cujo"" and ""Christine"".",1082073600,46,1056,4.713513513513513
180160,4,0790747693,"I think it is odd that people view this movie as a horror and then get upset by it. The movie cannot be completely categorized in any one genre since each story attempts to create a different mood. The only pervasive style, however, is dark comedy.
The first segment is nothing but humor, with a slight touch of morbid moments. A good example of the type of humor that's in this story is when James Woods' character has tried to quit smoking and he goes to a party. The room is completely smoke-filled and everybody offers him a cigarette every three seconds. Soon, he starts to hallucinate--and sees a giant pack of cigarettes walking around and taunting him. Obviously, this isn't horror.
The second segment is the most serious of all three. It is supposed to be a suspense story, and it is mostly successful. I've always enjoyed it, but given that it is surrounded by much campier material, it seems out of place here.
The third segment is an adventure story. It could, because of the presence of the troll, be considered a horror by some viewers, but it is incredibly silly. It's the story of a cat fighting out a duel with a little monster, replete with Howie-Mandel-esque voice-overs. It alternates quickly between humor and adventure, but it is not scary unless you are a small child.
The movie suffers only for two reasons: one is that some special effects shots have suffered greatly (although quite a few are still amazing). The other is that whenever the movie does try to be serious, it never works as well as it should. It's like watching a clown do a routine with seltzer water, and then trying to recite a soliloquy from ""Hamlet"" without changing his make-up. By the time the movie does reach its more serious moments, you'll already be in a laughing mood.",1081123200,24,1771,4.625396825396826
180161,2,0790747693,"This is NOT horror, and the effects are tacky.  But it's still an average film.  Cat's Eye tells the story of a tortoise-shell cat, who seems to be  able to save everybody from monsters and other scary things.
The first  tale is quite creepy, and is a bout a man who tries to give up smoking.  The Quit Smoking company try sinister methods to try and get the man to  quit.
The second part is the main NON HORROR film.  It's about a man who  is forced to walk around a ledge on the top of a tall hotel.  An average  thriller, but not scary.
The third is where the supernatural comes into  it, but the monster has little bells on it's head and is about ten  centimetres tall, so this is the worst story of the lot.  In places, it's  funny, but is it meant to be?
There are better films out there, but watch  this if you have nothing better to do.",963619200,2,844,4.060975609756097
