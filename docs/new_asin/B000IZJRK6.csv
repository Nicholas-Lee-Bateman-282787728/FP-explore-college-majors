8148054,5,B000IZJRK6,Salman Khan in this movie was so awesome. This movie made me laugh till I cried. Anil Kapoor was unbelievably funny. All the crazy behaviour kept you wondering what would happen next.,1373155200,,183,4.75
8148055,4,B000IZJRK6,"What stood out in this film, for me, was the music. The story was simple and a little tired, but still well acted and delivered. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who might be a fan of the genre.",1356998400,,196,4.051282051282051
8148056,2,B000IZJRK6,"This movie became boring with its one-line series of jokes about men trying to cheat behind their wives backs and get away with it. While they mildly change their ways on the surface at the end, they really ha vent changed within.
I didn't find the 'humour' funny. From a female view the guys are cute but jerks with a one-dimensional attitude to women.
I found myself fast-forwarding through it hoping it may change but it never seemed to.
Any marks I give it are for cinematography, nice scenery and the actors who are solid enough themselves.
The buffed shirt-off displays of Salman Khan do nothing for me - though they appeared to please him a lot!
Guys seem to like this more than females as it is men behaving badly and largely achieving their fantasies even though it takes a bit of work and some 'comedic' misunderstandings and cover-ups. Definitely not my style of humour.
The music and small amount of dancing didn't rescue it from mediocrity either.",1235606400,4,960,4.686390532544379
8148057,4,B000IZJRK6,"NO ENTRY is a 2005 Bollywood sex farce and a very funny one. Several big name Bollywood stars work their magic as they breezily traipse thru a loopy plot rife with extra-marital affairs, suicidal misunderstandings, near wedding fiascos, and assumed and mistaken identities. The film delves into the doings of seven people, whose lives progressively become more zany and complicated as lie builds upon lie and calamity compounds calamity, often with hilarious results. To be fair, the blame for most of the wacky happenings mostly lie at the feet of the male characters.

Get a load of the plot: Kishan (Anil Kapoor) is a reserved newspaperman and a faithful husband who is burdened with a persistently suspicious wife, Kaajal (Lara Dutta). Kishen's opposite is Prem (Salman Khan), who is fun loving and likes to get some on the side, if you know what I mean. He has an adoring wife, Pooja (Esha Deol), who remains oblivious to his rampant womanizing. Prem, you see, is blessed with a talent for inspired prevarications and, so far, hasn't been caught out by Pooja. Kishan tries to set Prem on the straight and narrow path, but Prem won't have any of that. Instead, he aims to teach Kishan a lesson. Prem hires Bobby (Bipasha Basu), a sultry and enterprising bar dancer, to trap Kishan in a compromising position. Soon enough, Kishan finds himself caught in an ever escalating web of deceit as he even embroils his faithful photographer Sunny (Fardeen Khan) in his shenanigans. This particularly sucks for Sunny as he himself is about to be married to Sanjana (Celina Jaitley), a cute girl who detests lying.

This is a consistently funny movie. The scrapes that Kishan, Sunny, and, later on, Prem get themselves into had me rolling in my chair. Besides the main arc of infidelity, there's a grin-worthy subplot about Sanjana erroneously believing Sunny to be suicidal. At one point, she even inadvertently causes Sunny's neighbors to hold an impromptu intervention for his sake. The comic mayhem reaches its crescendo at the Mauritius resort, as the wacky escapades of the various mix-and-matched couples had my gut busting with choking laughter. Another reason I liked NO ENTRY is because, as it turns out, there really isn't a bad person in the film. Bobby, the notorious other woman, has a compelling reason for her actions. Even Prem kind of redeems himself.

The acting is very good. Those who are used to Anil Kapoor in his more serious roles will be pleasantly surprised at how well he comports himself in a farcical comedy. I caught myself chortling time and again at the unfamiliar sight of Kapoor beset by panic attacks. His cohort in panic, Fardeen Khan, is equally as funny. Bipasha Basu, as the catalyst of all the madness, takes full advantage of her vixen part by delivering a sexy yet amusing performance. Unlike Bipasha, however, Lara, Esha, and Celeina all play more of a straight (wo)man role, so their effect comedically is felt on a second hand level. But their presence is integral to the story and to the humor. For a bonafide hottie, Lara is convincing as the perennially jealous wife. Esha isn't on screen much, but she has an effective, poignant scene near the end. Even Salman Khan, who, sorry to say, I normally find annoying and smug, proves to be, well, less annoying here. He's still smug as hell, though.

What else is left? The music? Mostly forgettable, although I enjoyed ""Dil Churake,"" the seduction song in Kashin's guest house. What I own is a 2-disc version of NO ENTRY. Disc one has an 11-minute-long ""Making of"" segment, an inconsequential NO ENTRY promo music launch, an interview with sexy Bipasha Basu, 12 minutes worth of deleted scenes (but with no sub-titles) which includes a confrontation between Bobby and the wives. Disc 2 has nothing to do with this movie but is something titled ""Dhamaal Zone"" and seems to be a compilation of selected song numbers from various Bollywood films.

So that's about it. This film was one of the biggest Bollywood hits of 2005 and rightfully so. If you've ever seen and enjoyed one of those classic screwball comedies from the '30s - you know, where there's a zany misunderstanding every ten minutes - then NO ENTRY's right up your preferences. In addition to the giggles, guys would have the bonus of ogling four very hot babes on screen. Girls, on the other hand, can drool over that buffed up Salman Khan guy. Or not.",1179619200,5,4402,4.83289124668435
8148058,4,B000IZJRK6,"Well, let me tell you all about the movie. No Entry is about Kishan (Anil Kapoor), a loyal and faithful husband. His wife Kajal (Lara Dutta) always suspects his loyalty and daydreams that he is cheating on her. When Kishan finally gets fed up with her suspicions, he goes to a club to drown in his miseries. He tells his friend Prem (Salman Khan) of his miseries and Prem sets him up with the Bobby (Bipasha Basu), a bar club dancer cum prostitute. Yet, Kishen is still the loyal husband and cannot cheat on his wife that easily. Follow the hilarious adventures Kishen has trying to hide his affair from his wife.",1135382400,,613,4.482142857142857
