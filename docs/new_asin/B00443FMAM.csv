8415629,1,B00443FMAM,"By the grand title of ""The Physics of Warfare"" one would expect some comprehensiveness, given the enormous range and sophistication of modern warmachines and equipment.  But the the half-length single DVD talks basically of high-speed photography, explosives, and fiber-optics.  Highly disappointing!!  And charge $40/- for it?",1507680000,,327,6.065217391304348
8415630,1,B00443FMAM,"While this was supposed to be military high speed photography, after five minutes, that theme of high speed photography ends after they show how the first pictures of shooting playing cards were made. Then we have ten minutes of police sniper school with almost no examples of high speed photography, mainly just a hollow point entering a gel block. Then we are off to space and debris impacts. There is a 'gun' that replicates debris impacts using ball bearings and we see a couple of already damaged targets. Ten minutes later and it is terrorist car bombs and a few explosions, nothing very explicit. I believe I have seen better explosion photography elsewhere. And then we are off to fibre optics and banking, with high speed photography of juggling 3-4 pins. Aside from the first five minutes, it was a complete waste of time.",1383523200,,832,4.784722222222222
