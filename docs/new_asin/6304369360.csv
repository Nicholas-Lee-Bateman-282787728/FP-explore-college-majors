7868879,3,6304369360,"The lead walks in on the murder scene as it is being investigated. He says how he doesn't get the modern art upon the wall; whence he is informed that that is the victim's blood. The commander then says something like, ""Harry, get this evidence to the lab."" Whence, an actor, wearing a big dog costume comes into the room and takes the evidence away in his mouth. Later on in the movie, Harry has announced that he is going to the ""running of the bulls."" Whence we find him out in front of several stout jogging ladies sporting closely shorn hair and comfortable running shoes. I didn't get it. So along with the requisite and barely gratuitous nudity, this movie is all about the laughs. Unfortunately, the plot is a mess. And some of the laughs go beyond acceptable suspension of disbelief. In the name of humor, Harry: shoots a woman, mows down a few pedestrians with his car, performs an accidental lobotomy on a waitress;  you know, funny things like that. But if I were to rate this review with some award, it would be the never coveted ""Honorable Mention"". This movie deserves an honorable mention in that its makers really did try to get a laugh out of me every few seconds; plot be damned.",1431561600,,1198,4.495412844036697

7868882,4,6304369360,"A beautiful blonde, whose face we don't see, is sitting atop a man, his hands tied to the bed.  Sound familiar?  Well, instead of an ice pick, she uses a chainsaw, and guess what?  From the moment the message ""This motion picture has been altered from its original format.  It has been dubbed in Swahili"", appears on screen, we know how serious this movie is.
The Concord Police Department investigates, with officers Dick Smoker and Harry Bates, the latter who find a clue through a wedding invitation.  The blonde getting married is Montana Beaver, though via her marriage to [] architect Lyle Shotz, becomes Montana Beaver-Shotz.  The exchange over this bit of info goes like this:
Smoker:  It was a lovely ceremony Mrs. Beaver-Shotz.
Montana: Montana, please.
Smoker:  It was a lovely Montana, Mrs. Beaver-Shotz.
Montana: The hyphen is silent.
Bates:  You shouldn't try to hide it.  You should be very proud to still have it on your wedding day.
Hyphen, hymen, get it?  This is typical of the dialogue throughout the movie, snappy, play-on-words, but delivered deadpan a la The Naked Gun.  Much of the film's strengths rest on that delivery, as well as sight gags.
Bates is very much lacking in the brain department.  His former partner Henry took the death of his dog hard and is dressed up in a dog costume, but Harry takes it all in stride.  ""He was a good cop.  Now he's a good pet.""
To complicate matters, there's Dakota, Montana's ""twin half-sister, once removed"", who falls for Harry.  She looks really nice when she has her hair like Bonnie Tyler in one scene.  Meanwhile, there are a few more killings.
This is mostly a parody of Basic Instinct, down to the ""no smoking in the interrogation scene"", but there are pokes at
Indecent Proposal, Silence Of The Lambs (the autopsy scene involving the cadavre ""Wait!  There's something in his mouth!""), The Three Faces Of Eve, and The Crying Game, as well as plays on verbal references to Rear Window, Dirty Harry and 9-1/2 Weeks.  Some of them are caught easily, such as the list of doctors paged over the hospital intercom--""Dr. Quinn, your show has been cancelled.""  Others are subtle, such as the opening scene at a restaurant, I heard a black man saying off-screen, ""Nicole, tell the waiter to get me one of them big a-- steak knives.""  I about bust a gut laughing.
The sex scene between Harry and Dakota involving pizza is sheer hilarity, with cartoon and animal sound effects, and Dakota has a really nice pair to boot.
Michael McGaharn is simply funny as Harry Bates, aided by the two luscious blondes, Elizabeth Key (Montana) and Gloria Lusak (Dakota).  A very silly movie lacking PC-ness of any kind.  It'll leave you with anything but a ""7-11 state of mind.""  Whoever thought Troma could make something so funny?",1047427200,,2779,4.753653444676409
7868883,4,6304369360,"Greetings from Tromaville!
A parody of cop films involves a cop who tries to solve a murder with his traumatized friend who is a policeman that think's he's a dog (""It's a shame, he was a good cop."" ""Yea, but he's a great dog!""), a woman who has an identical twin step-sister, and many other zany charectors!
If you are a fan of ""The Naked Gun"", ""Hot Shots"", or ""UHF"", you should definetly check out ""Blonds Have More Guns""",993600000,,423,4.367088607594937
