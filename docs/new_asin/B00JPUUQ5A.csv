6388808,5,B00JPUUQ5A,"Criterion has once again shown that they are the best in the business when it comes to packaging films. THE ESSENTIAL JACQUES DEMY is a wonderful addition to the fold.
The six films in the set overall are very good. The restorations are uniformly superb. The only film where the original negative no longer exists (LOLA) is serviceably restored. As I made my way through all the films and the extensive extras, there were two things that stood out.
* The heroic effort of Demy's family to successfully raise his stature in the annals of cinema.  When I was finished combing through the gift set, I wanted to give the family (wife Agns Varda, son Mathieu and legally-adopted daughter Rosalie) a standing ovation for their peerless efforts.
* The interlocking characters and unifying elements of Demy's body of work really surface when his films are viewed back-to-back. Just a few of the myriad interesting connections: The settings are, with the exception of BAY OF ANGELS, working-class portside towns; all of the films feature strong leading-lady roles; the women are all unmarried, often with children; music is a strong element in all of them and all but UNE CHAMBRE EN VILLE are scored by the incomparable Michel Legrand.
Overall the films selected are a strong representation of Demy's oeuvre. A few notes on the individual titles:

LOLA (1961) Demy's first film has the then-novel idea of crisscrossing story lines, and provides a great role for Anouk Aime as a cabaret chanteuse raising a family while awaiting the return of her long-lost lover. The tale involves a young wanderer entering her world. Camerawork by Raoul Coutard.
BAY OF ANGELS (1963) Great showcase for Jeanne Moreau as a woman addicted to the glamorous world of gambling. Claude Mann is perfect as a young guy who meets Moreau by chance and ends up addicted to her.
THE UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG (1964) This timeless classic put both Demy and Michel Legrand on the international map. The exquisite film transfer makes the film more radiant than ever. Five Oscar nominations (Foreign Language Film, Story and Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, Song ""I Will Wait for You,"" Original Score and Adaptation or Music Treatment .)
THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT (1967) Exuberant musical from the pen of Legrand. The most joyful and upbeat of the series. Features wonderful sun-dappled and splashy cinematography by Ghislain Cloquet. Final film for Franoise Dorlac, Catherine Deneuve's sister. Oscar nominee for Best Musical.
DONKEY SKIN (1970) Adaptation of Charles Perrault's fairy tale has ravishing photography by Cloquet and a great central performance by Catherine Deuneuve, compensating for Jacques Perrin's wrongheaded prince. Unusual subject matter, not only for a musical but for a fairy tale, of incest.
UNE CHAMBRE EN VILLE (1982) Darkest of the films and operatic in format and song score, this film features strong acting by the principals: Dominique Sanda, Michel Piccoli, Richard Berry and Danielle Darrieux. A late-career gem in Demy's canon.
A series of Demy's SHORT FILMS lends the set a good sense of range and perspective.

The extras, as mentioned, are without exception top-notch. Best of the lot is the visual essay ""Jacques Demy, A to Z"" by film critic James Quandt. Also deserving of high merit are Agns Varda's 1995 documentary THE WORLD OF JACQUES DEMY and her 1993 documentary THE YOUNG GIRLS TURN 25.
Retailing for a hefty $125, look for flash sales on Amazon, the Criterion website (usually in February and October) and other places.  Overall an outstanding addition to a serious film-collector's library and the director's endearing fan base. This set leaves the viewer with a very warm glow and a taste for more.",1412985600,13,3716,5.066993464052287
6388809,4,B00JPUUQ5A,"Going in, I had limited exposure to Demy, and wasn't a huge fan of what I saw. Even though this set only includes the `Essential' titles, it's the best representation of his work, and with the shorts included, I felt that I had seen the development and evolution of style.

Even though I wouldn't call any of his films masterpieces, I closed this set having a lot more respect for his craft. He went to places that other filmmakers wouldn't go, and did some things that were truly original. I really like that his film universe had some connectivity, with reoccurring characters, motifs, and references to other films in the mise-en-scene. This would not be as easy to pick up if you watched the films individually over a longer span of time.

There are a couple of titles omitted that I wanted to see, especially Model Shop. My expectations are not high, but it seems to fit into the Demy universe since it is a sequel to Lola. Since the Demy family was so involved in this project, I am hopeful that Criterion will work on some of these other titles as standalone releases. On that note, I'm praying for an upgrade of Varda's 4-films. The fact that this set was so comprehensive and she was heavily involved, I'd say it is a strong possibility.

Aside from Lola, the restorations were all impressive. Many of the discs had a short restoration supplement, and it was neat to see them remove blemishes as they found them. Lola's restoration was poor, but I know that they had problems getting a workable master print. Since it was his debut feature film and it set the stage for so much of his later work, it had to be included regardless of the quality.

As for my impression of Demy, as mentioned, it improved. Musicals are my blind spot, but I found myself enjoying The Umbrellas of Cherbourg far more on this new visit, and I enjoyed The Young Girls of Rochefort. As I progressed further into the set, I found myself appreciating Lola and Bay of Angels a little more, and will enjoy revisiting them at a later date. Donkey Skin was disappointing. While Une chambre en ville didn't measure up to it's stylistic sister, it was surprisingly effective, and it was refreshing to see Demy push beyond the boundaries he set for himself.

There were no commentaries on any discs. While that was disappointing, the vast number of supplements almost made up for it. I appreciated the two Varda documentaries a great deal. In fact, her The World of Jacques Demy is my favorite film of the entire set. I would have liked more critical examinations on the earlier discs, but was pleased to view James Quandt's A-Z evaluation. His essay and Varda's documentary were on the final disc, and that punctuated the set extremely well.

I'd say this is a must buy for anyone with even a slight interest in Demy, even if he was up and down as a filmmaker.",1410393600,9,2837,4.56385068762279

6388812,5,B00JPUUQ5A,This collection is every bit as good as you'd expect. The restorations of each film are fantastic.

8653126,5,B00JPUUQ5A,"Okay, finally getting around to writing a review for this set.  I love Jacques Demy and have since I saw The Umbrellas of Cherbourg on its opening day and stayed and saw it two more times (one could do that in those days).  I find there's something to enjoy in almost all of his films, even the later wacky ones.  This Blu-ray set is a bit of a mixed bag and the reason for that I'll make clear in a bit.

Most importantly, Umbrellas looks pretty excellent here - the upgrade from the DVD is pretty very large.  Unfortunately, The Young Girls of Rochefort isn't quite as good - same people restored it, but it's a bit yellower than it should be, which is a shame and it shouldn't be and would have been easy to correct.  But I suspect that in the end Mr. Demy's widow, Ms. Varda approved this - she was responsible for all the DVD transfers, which were horrible on all these films, as well as a theatrical reissue of Young Girls which was one of the most appalling things I've ever had the misfortune of seeing.  I had a 16mm dye transfer Technicolor print of Young Girls and it had the most glorious eye-popping color with NO yellow cast to it.  The other pity here is not to include the English dub for Young Girls - it's very interesting and worthwhile.

The Bay of Angels transfer really isn't too great, but everything else is fine.  But even with those caveats, the set is a must-have if you love the films of Mr. Demy, who, unlike the filmmakers of La La Land, was a true original.",1529712000,,1488,4.2821428571428575

8653129,5,B00JPUUQ5A,"This is a FANTASTIC set of some VERY good films.  I love Jacques Demy's films, ever since I saw The Umbrellas of Cherbourg in the theater in 1997.

The transfers are fantastic!  I do have a complaint though with Amazon.  I received this the first time and the boxed set that it came in was a little smashed in and not in perfect condition.

I then did an even exchange.  The next box was also not in perfect condition.  I decided to keep it as this seems to be an issue with Amazon.

I am not speaking about the shipping box. I am talking about box set ""box"" with the blu ray/dvds.",1457308800,5,581,4.125

8653132,4,B00JPUUQ5A,"This is not only just an essential collection to movie buffs as the name implied but also the body work of a renowned nouvelle vague film maker. Prior to this release none of the DVD reissues did justice to the restoration effort. That could very well the case but the restoration decisions are somewhat outdated. For example, the transfer was made to 2K digital intermediate, whereas it could have been done to at least 4K, for a future-proof re-release whenever it is needed (and, judging from experience, it will).

One of the assets of this collection is to have ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"" transferred with the 70 mm version multichannel soundtrack, as compared to mono DVD prior release.

At any rate, the picture quality is overall miles away from the DVDs, and for that reason it is worth getting it.

For your reference: I watched the disks in an 4K TV set, upscaled signal from the Oppo BDP-103.",1438300800,,908,4.734177215189874

8653134,5,B00JPUUQ5A,"Jacques Demy's films fall squarely in with the French New Wave, both in date and in style, but Demy is such a relaxed, populist filmmaker that he feels worlds apart from most of the movement. From the low-stakes romance of LOLA on through the achingly lovely THE YOUNG GIRLS OF ROCHEFORT, the first four films in this set are among the best ever made, beautiful and emotional and fantastically crowd-pleasing. While DONKEY SKIN and UNE CHAMBRE EN VILLE are perhaps a little bit less essential than the first four films of the set and it leaves out at least one Demy film that fans of Lola absolutely need to see, this is nevertheless a worthy, beautiful blu-ray set, and one that needs to be seen by anyone with a fondness for classic Hollywood style.",1423440000,5,751,4.611940298507463
