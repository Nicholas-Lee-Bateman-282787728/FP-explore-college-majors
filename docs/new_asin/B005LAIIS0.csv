4774334,4,B005LAIIS0,"I saw this hoping that I would like it as much as I anticipated, but the ending kind of disappointed me. I did enjoy the movie and I felt the movie did a great job at making us(the audience) seem to want to seek vengeance upon those vicious wolves, but I guess we have to use our own imagination by the time the credits roll at the end. Kind of an open ending. Don't get me wrong. I like it when films do that, but I don't think it worked for me here. I wanted more but didn't get it. However, I did really enjoy the movie overall. Great acting, good directing, and interesting characters. I give it 4 stars! I wanted to give it 5 but watch the ending and you'll see my reason for removing a star from a potential 5 star movie.

Updated: Okay, the fact that you have to sit through the entire credits to see the conclusion in theaters is still unfair!",1327795200,,851,4.095808383233533
4774335,5,B005LAIIS0,"""The Grey"" is great! This is how the story goes: A group of oil-rig roughnecks are left stranded on the sub-arctic tundra after their plane experiences a complete mechanical failure and crashes into the remote Alaskan wilderness. The survivors, battling mortal injuries, biting cold and ravenous hunger, are relentlessly hunted and pursued by a vicious pack of rogue wolves.

The cast led by Liam Neeson (as Ottway) is great. The directing by Joe Carnahan (who also produced) is great. The screenplay (based on the short story ""Ghost Walker"" by Ian Mackenzie Jeffers) by Carnahan & Jeffers is great.

The music by Marc Streitenfeld is great. The cinematography by Masanobu Takayanagi is great. The film editing by Roger Barton, Jason Hellmann & Joseph Jett Sally is great. The casting by John Papsidera is great. The production design by John Willett is great. The art direction by Ross Dempster is great. The set decoration by Peter Lando is great. The costume design by Courtney Daniel is great. The special make-up, creature and animatronic effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is great.

This is a great action-thriller that keeps your mind thinking while your heart is racing and you are on the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson is great as Ottway and this is another great movie for him. This is also another great movie for director Joe Carnahan. This is also a great movie to start the year off with.",1327795200,4,1412,4.875
4774336,4,B005LAIIS0,"Let's get one thing out of the way.  This is not a story about psychotic rogue wolves seeking to eat humans.  This is not a story about werewolves.  It is about survival in a part of the world unwelcome to man.  A group of oil workers on the Alaska pipeline are heading to Anchorage for a little R and R when the plane goes down in the frozen wilderness.  Miraculously 7 survive the crash.  Liam Neeson is fortunately one of the survivors.  He is a marksman employed by the company and is charged with keeping the workers safe from wolves.  He is suicidal because of the recent death of his wife.  These early scenes must have been difficult for Neeson given his own personal circumstances.  In any case, those memories of his wife sustain him as he attempts to lead the survivors to safety.  Attempt is the operative word here.  In addition to below freezing temperatures, blizzards and a lack of food and water, the group must also deal with a pack of wolves looking for dinner.

Ottway (Neeson) knows wolves are cunning hunters and will pick off the men one by one if they let their guard down.  The movie is terribly moving at times as each of the men has their own skeletons in the closet or loved ones waiting to see them.  They are full of grit but a lack of weapons and adaptability to the elements puts them at great risk.  Yes there are confrontations both with the wolves and each other.  And yes, the wolves are vicious but in a realistic way.  Escapist material?  You bet, but don't look for a happy ending.  If you sit through the entire credit list at the end of the film, there is a very brief scene that may make you feel better.  See it!",1327708800,3,1655,4.3431372549019605
4774337,5,B005LAIIS0,this movie is awesome. liam neeson is an outstanding actor. thats the main reason i went and saw this movie. i thought that it was made very well. the only thing i can complain about the film is the ending it is not what you think. but all in all it was awesome and it kept you at the edge of your seat. i also like how realistic the film was. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.,1327708800,2,400,3.8313253012048194
4774338,4,B005LAIIS0,"Survival movies seem to be pretty rare these days, which makes each new one a treat to see, especially when they feature grade A stars (Liam Neeson in this instance) taking on the title theme monster or element (in this case, vicious wolves).  And while the film may veer into some cliches we've seen many times before, it manages to be an effective thriller that grips you until the very end.

""The Grey"" follows Ottway, a hunter tasked with keeping Alaskan pipeline workers safe from hostile wildlife.  It's a lonely, hard job, and things only get worse, for while flying out to another job, Ottway is caught up in a plane crash that leaves him and a few other survivors deep in the frozen heart of Alaska.  Now he must rally the others, and fight to survive not only the elements, but a pack of wolves hell-bent on taking them out as well.

What struck me most about ""The Grey"" is how grim it is.  This isn't an uplifting story of people banding together to overcome adversity; this is a film about desperate men out of their element, where death can strike at any time, and they're the ones at the bottom of the food chain.  And while it seems to make for a very despair-filled film, it works.  You're sucked into a situation that feels completely real, from the bare minimum use of CGI (when Neeson is freezing out in the snow-filled plains, it's real, and not a studio), to the danger of the ever-present wolves, and the way the survivors react.  In fact, a nice surprise of the film is the little character moments that pop up throughout the film, such as a hate-filled rant against God, to a moving scene at the side of a river that I won't ruin here.  Neeson himself turns in a fantastic performance of a world-weary man who is forced to take charge of a bad situation, with only his knowledge of the wild to help him.  He's not an action hero, or a macho-body builder, but an ordinary, middle-aged man who's tired of life, and it works wonderfully.

But while ""The Grey"" works very well on all fronts, it does fall into the standard cliche of ""picking off the survivors one by one,"" which leads the viewer to wonder if the film will defy the stereotype of having one lone survivor by the end of the film.  In addition, it's disappointing that, for having such a strong and gripping story, the film has a very weak ending that made me feel cheated.

Still, despite it's two flaws, ""The Grey"" is a gripping survival film that feels completely realistic in every way: not once are you asked to suspend your disbelief, because the need never arises.  The characters are strong and believable, and the film has a visceral punch that grabs hold, and doesn't let go.  For fans of survival films, ""The Grey"" comes highly recommended.

Oh, and one last thing: be sure to stay through the credits, as there's a scene afterwards.",1327622400,2,2828,4.50293542074364
4774339,5,B005LAIIS0,"This movie takes place in Alaska, and was actually filmed in British Columbia. The main character is played by Liam Neeson, a hunter who is hired by an oil company he works for to protect the company's workers that are working on the pipeline from wild animals, specifically wolves. This movie revolves around a plane crash and the few survivors' attempt to reach safety under very treacherous conditions and under constant threat from the wilds.

A word of caution - this movie is very violent!  I started out not liking this movie, but it gripped me and held my attention throughout the movie. Just a tip - if you decide to watch this movie, make sure you stay until the very end of the credits because otherwise you'll miss something.",1327622400,10,737,4.661538461538462
4774340,3,B005LAIIS0,"First, let me ask you a question: How would you prefer to die? Plane crash? Suicide? Starvation? Diabetes? Freezing? Drowning? Bleeding to death? Falling? Attacked by a wolf? In this grim endurance test, you get to evaluate them all and pick a favorite. My companion can't vote, her eyes were covered too much of the time. When it's available on Amazon.com, I'll make her watch it!

We start with a North Slope oil-drilling team getting ready to go home for a much-needed break. They are rude, crude and lewd. It's clear from the get-go that the plane is going to have icing problems, so it's no surprise when they crash in the trackless wilderness where a relentless wolf pack sees the handful of survivors as intruders.

Let's talk about some of those survivors:

  *Liam Neeson (""Taken"") is a grieving widower with no will to live ...until he's about to die...THEN he kicks into gear and starts a titanic struggle to survive.
  *Dermot Mulroney (""The Family Tree""), almost unrecognizable here, is a near-sighted engineer who is a steady influence when the going gets rough...but he IS afraid of heights.
  *Frank Grillo (""Warrior"") never hears a plan he likes. He argues about everything and challenges everyone. We suspect all that bombast conceals a cowardly yellow streak down his spine.
  *James Badge Dale (""Rubicon"") seems to be a sweetheart, always fair, always even-handed and certainly a trooper. He has a scene here that reminded me of ""Sometimes a Great Notion,"" please tell me if you, too, recognize it.

We have various personalities: the big-talking coward, the trash-talking wit, the taciturn Alpha male, the arguing contrarian, you know, all the stereotypes.... The script provides an interlude of humor as they relax around a campfire, but we mostly see dogged attempts to survive. The only outdoors training I ever had was with an Arizona Scout troop, but the city slickers who wrote this script made such laughable choices for their characters I wanted to shout at the screen, ""Oh, come ON!""

A friend of mine said he really liked it, but after two hours of arduous struggle, I found myself leaning toward suicide...",1327536000,2,2138,4.93854748603352
4774341,4,B005LAIIS0,"There were a lot of things that felt like they were kept secret on purpose before sitting down and viewing The Grey for the first time. The trailer hints at the movie being nothing more than a survival thriller starring Liam Neeson as he struggles to survive not only the unrelenting cold elements, but also the ferocious wolves that inhabit his surroundings. The Grey is written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the man who brought us Smokin' Aces and The A-Team. The movie is also produced by Tony and Ridley Scott, which you think the marketing campaign would jump all over but doesn't even mention. Not only that, but there is quite a bit more to the movie than the trailer and TV spots let on.

As the movie begins, Ottway (Liam Neeson) narrates a letter he's writing to his wife. This segment just made me realize what my life is lacking most right now and that's a Liam Neeson voiceover for every thought that crosses my mind. Think about that. It'd be the most amazing thing ever. The trailer reveals a few major things: that Ottway is stranded in the middle of nowhere in the blistering cold thanks to a plane crash and that wolves stand in the way of him actually surviving this ordeal. The plane crash itself is one of the best executed in recent memory. The way it's filmed and edited is downright ruthless. It's as if you're on the plane as it goes down. The Grey doesn't just place you in this blizzard-ridden hell infested with wolves, it kicks your teeth down your throat, laughs in your face, and throws you into it with everything it has.

The movie gives new meaning to some of the simplest things. Seeing your breath in cold weather takes on an entirely new definition and the way The Grey deals with death just feels incredibly powerful. Ottway questions faith right from the start and takes matters into his own hands throughout the movie. The events that transpire take a toll on even the most religious plane crash survivors. Death is more of a relief than something worth distancing yourself from. Ottway describes it as being a warm sensation and thinking about the thing you love most in life before completely giving yourself into it. Many of the campfire conversations are entirely more impactful than they have any right to be. The conversation about faith in general hits you like a potato sack full of cinder blocks.

The Grey manages to shout its message even when there's nothing being said on-screen. One of the images that stuck with me long after the movie ended was the shot of blood flowing into the paw print of a wolf in the snow. There's a scene by the river that strictly relies on sound and the way you succumb to it is nothing more than brilliant. There's another shot at the end of the film where (and I'm trying to avoid spoilers the best I can) Ottway is arranging some objects in the snow. The way Liam Neeson's fat, sausage-like fingers delicately wrap themselves around these objects and the way his hands tremble as he does this illustrates not only what this man has been through, but also that he's at the end of his rope. Plus the movie will make you want to look over your shoulder the next time you consider relieving yourself out in nature somewhere.

That level of greatness The Grey eventually achieves isn't around at all times. Some lame dialogue does squeak through and characters manage to do really stupid things at times (John Diaz, played by Frank Grillo, especially), but that seems to help the movie more than anything. People, real people, occasionally do stupid things especially when they're scared. So this kind of made the characters feel more genuine and made it very clear that certain characters were caving under pressure.

There was a movie that came out back in 2000 that was called Vertical Limit. It was one of my most trying times at the movie theater. I fought vehemently to leave about halfway through because I hated it so much, but I was with people at the time who wanted to stay until the end. It was probably one of the worst experiences I've ever had to pay for. The Grey is basically everything I wanted that movie to be. The cast is fantastic, their actions are mostly believable, and there's this meaning to everything that really speaks to you.

The Grey is a grainy thriller that knocks the wind out of you on more than one occasion. In fact, it's rare that the movie actually allows you to catch your breath. Everything is such a raw, vicious, and brutal test of faith. It's fantastically violent and Liam Neeson is superb. If The Grey is anything to fall back on, then 2012 is going to be one hell of a year for movies.",1327536000,215,4614,4.559710494571773

Most of the supporting actors' performances looked just that, like they were acting. To have the plot move them away from the crash site where they could have built a shelter from the wreckage to protect themselves from the wolves made no sense at all.  The idea was that no one would find them there. So they would be more easily found wandering around in a desolate, remote territory with a pack of wolves ready to attack them in broad daylight?  I won't say more because it's all critical and this is just the way the film struck me.

2. After the plane crash, hero tells the other survivors they should leave the plane crash site and head for the distant trees. This is stupid because:
  a) Part of the fuselage is intact and gives them shelter from the wind and snow;
  b) The crash site is easily visible from the air and rescuers could find them if they stay there;
  c) Debris from the crash is all around, including luggage with extra clothing in it, things they could use to defend themselves against the wolves, fuel for fires. They quickly find the alcohol, presumably there were also food and medical supplies on the plane.
3. The threat from the wolves is ridiculously exaggerated.
4. A man jumps off a cliff into tall trees growing below for no good reason. Why not walk along the edge of the cliff until they find away to climb down, or see if the cliff ends?
5. A guy hurts his knee but staggers on for miles. Nobody thinks of getting him a walking stick or improvising crutches.
6. The same guy gives up and sits down to die. The other two survivors make token protests, but leave him there.
7. A guy falls in the river and drowns. The hero tries to rescue him and gets soaked from head to foot. Maybe the temperature's above freezing, but there's snow on the riverbanks. He's going to die of hypothermia unless he can get out of the wet clothes, build a fire and dry them and raise his body temperature. But what does he do? He sits on the riverbank and curses God. Then he walks on, apparently fine.
8. The hero prepares for a battle with the head wolf, who is coincidentally black, I suppose to symbolize death. And he realizes he's blundered into the wolves' den, many miles from the crash site, when he told the other guys (now all dead) they had to leave the crash site because they were too near the wolves' den. He's an expert on wolves, see? The other wolves, for some reason, now don't want to attack him, only the head wolf. The fight begins:
9. And the movie ends. We never find out who won.",1507680000,,2106,4.346055979643766

Very shallow plot (wolves start hunting men and seem to have human intelligence, feelings and motives).  No character development in whole move and the plot was thin..  The worst part is the technical aspect of the film.  If anyone spent on weekend camping in the winter they could have picked out dozens of technical flaws.  From sticks that burned like torches, just found in the woods to men sleeping in below zero temperatures without putting on their hats. They had hats, but were sleeping without them.  There were so many flakey technical flaws that it was obnoxious.  By the end of the movie I was angry that I has wasted my time watching it.

4774965,1,B005LAIIS0,"Did Liam Neeson lose a bet with someone, so he had to star in this dog of a horror movie?  Boring, repetitive, long shots of him day dreaming about his ex-wife or girlfriend start the story. The plane taking Liam & the crew back home crashes. Stuck in the wilds of Alaska in a raging blizzard you'd think they'd be smart & shelter in the plane wreckage & wait for rescue to come. Nope. Liam just says ""they'll never find us here"" so they all set out on foot to run around in the raging blizzard. Stalking these dopes are the wolves, who act like werewolves (but aren't) & they attack pretty much anyone who moves. And since the men left the plane behind, they have no shelter, so they move a lot.
We shut it off after the series of events 3/4 of the way thru, that really stretched any plausibility this dog of a wolf movie had left.

I've waited for YEARS to find a movie that was written by someone CREATIVE enough to NOT bring in the cavalry to make rescues at the last moment!  LOVE it!!  That said, though --- and this isn't a spoiler because it didn't happen in this movie --- I'm STILL waiting to see that which I MOST want to see i8n a movie.  That being a situation where the day can be saved only by a last-minute save... and THEN the disaster happens irreversibly just BEFORE the rescuer arrives!  There must be some INANE rule, written or unwritten, that writers and directors invariably follow, which calls for NEVER allowing that to happen!  And... has anyone EVER yet seen a movie in which a toddler is playing out in a dusty street in a Western... and DOES get run over by a stagecoach and finished off just seconds before the would-be rescuer could reach him to scoop him up out of harm's way?

4775000,5,B005LAIIS0,"I like this movie! It is an allegory about pack mentality and the power of nature. Liam Neeson plays a hired gun for the oil company. His job is to kill the giant wolves that pose a threat to the oil workers. After a flight home goes horribly wrong (One of the most tense scenes in recent movie making). Several survivors must group together to protect themselves from the elements, but mostly from the wolves that are hunting them. The correlation between the men in the group and the activities of the wolves is really a great way of pointing out how humanity and civilized behavior breaks down in these situations. The fact that we are all animals trying to survive and protect ourselves plays out in this film. Liam's character has great knowledge of the animals he hunts, and as he explains their behavior to his group, we see the same types of interactions begin to take place inside the camp of survivors. Great movie, and the tension is palpable. You will recognize lots of famous faces that will surprise you as they reveal who they are. good stuff.",1499990400,3,1058,4.573684210526316

4775169,4,B005LAIIS0,"Liam Neeson plays a man hired by a firm to kill wolves who were attacking its workers. The film starts when he kills one, feels bad about it, and is about to commit suicide because he has no meaning in life, and is saved from doing so only because something happens.
He is later on a plane flying north when the plane crashes. All but seven men are killed in the crash. Neeson takes the lead in trying to save the seven men from the wolves that are stalking them.
I think that in order to understand this film, one needs to remember the experience of Victor Frankl. He was only able to survive the concentration camp terrible experience because he had meaning in his life. throughout his awful ordeal, he thought of his wife who was in a different camp. He thought of being with her. Thinking of her gave him meaning. Even though she died in the camp, thinking of her saved his life.

4775451,4,B005LAIIS0,"What's to Love: The modern-day boom town feel of men dedicated to outdistancing their pasts through hard work in a desolate place; the elemental nature of life: helping a man die, pushing back against fear with humor; the human spirit of being able to ""lean-into"" tall odds; the unrelenting nature of inhospitable wilderness; the loss of food-chain dominance and a return to life on the defensive; the touching way an utterly spent and exhausted man will just give up. All very atmospheric, minimalist, and thought-provoking for those of us seated in a warm, well-lit room with plenty in our stomachs and no injuries.

What's to Hate: Missing the little things that help the viewer suspend disbelief: The pilot never says anything to the passengers, men in life-threatening situation change gears... they/we are not extensions of our normal belligerent selves after surviving a crash in the wilderness; neither to cold, stiff men take many risks like leaping 10 - 15 feet through the air; neither do they walk very far in deep snow with to-the-bone knee lacerations... these kinds of injuries stiffen up pretty quick.

What's to Ponder: Getting so many important things right in this film, how could the writer, director, producer, et al. get so many small but important things wrong? Why the ending? Why the rail against a God that won't show mercy on a species that has forsaken Him/Her/It by coming to our rescue? Why leaving the viewer with no ending, either damning or redemptive? It's as if the writer, director, etc. just wanted to trot out their anger (and likely their atheism) hoping we would forget that they controlled the narrative every step of the way. I'm guessing they weren't imaginative enough to come up with something better that the three options that come readily to mind. Pity to have done so much right and to have had such decent actors... and to have produced that! A three-star film give a fourth star for aiming higher than similar films.",1481414400,,1967,4.903903903903904

4775887,4,B005LAIIS0,"A couple of things rubbed me wrong about it like the fearlessness of the wolves and the complete helplessness of the survivors against them.

 I would think you would only need a knife or sharp stick to take care of business against a wolf but aside from that focusing on the scenery and the generally harrowing situation (even if there were no wolves) it was a compelling movie. Liam Neeson as usual was excellent and I thought the others played their roles well. The plane crash in the movie was probably the most gripping I've seen from an inside POV too.

 The Grey very much reminded me of the brilliant Australian film Van Diemen's Land.",1463702400,,643,4.565217391304348

It is truly, as Mr. Neeson puts it, about ""Men, unfit for mankind"" against mother nature in all of her absolute fury, but most of all it is a pulse pounding and riveting exploration of loss and real courage, and faith, and how real men face almost insurmountable odds, and how men, in the worst of circumstances treat and regard their fellow man.

4776143,5,B005LAIIS0,"Great characters, great writing, beautiful cinematography, numerous memorable scenes, it's really hard to find credible faults in the film. It's not the most upbeat movie out there and it was clearly was marketed incorrectly, but it is absolutely my favorite film. On top of it just being so well made from top to bottom, it has commentary on themes such as destiny, God's will, depression, religion, survival, suicide, and will power. More so than any other film that I've seen, it breaks down what people will live and die for and how life is a fight that we all must participate in. Some might be turned off by the film's incredibly open ending (some see the ending as a humanistic rejection of society while others see it as a Christian redemption story, and both theories are well supported), but personally that's what kept me coming back. As long as you go into the film knowing that it is a bitter-sweat drama about survival (in the literal and figurative sense) instead of ""Taken with wolves"" as the trailers pitched it, I'm confident in saying that you will love this film.",1454112000,11,1083,4.735449735449736

4776214,4,B005LAIIS0,"It's about a group of guys who crash land in the middle of arctic nowhere while flying home from their jobs at an oil refinery.  The story focuses on the Liam Neeson character, a taciturn and largely mysterious guy going through a depression.  Aside from the fact that they just crash landed in the middle of a freezing wilderness, they are also harassed by a pack of wolves who seem to be less than welcoming right from the start.  The movie follows their attempts to survive.

What makes this movie unique and worthwhile is the substance that underwrites it.  It really has a heart about each of these guys who would, at first glance, appear less than completely sympathetic.  Throughout the entire movie, I was really surprised at the twists and turns:  it's a really fresh take on the old survival genre and the acting, most especially by Neeson, is fantastic.  Neeson does a great job of telling a story about who he is and what he's going through in just about every scene.  Really a fantastic job.

Don't watch this movie if you are traumatized by animals attacks (the wolves are not friendly) or if you dislike ambiguous endings, because things are not wrapped up in a perfect little bow in the end of this story.  Overall a good movie, though.",1449705600,9,1252,4.594594594594595

They didn't seem realistic as they continually assault the survivors. Still I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it highly to any survival style movie fan.

The Grey is a film about a group of oil workers whose plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness. The survivors are hunted down, one by one, by a pack of mysterious wolves. By mistake, the little group moves closer and closer to the main den of the predators.

While the wolves are said to be real flesh and blood timber wolves, they come across as ghostly and monstrous creatures. Cryptids? Demons? The wolves kill for the sake of it, not for food. They also have certain human traits, lusting for revenge after one of their kind is killed and eaten by the oil-men.

The film has an underlying philosophical message, which comes close to atheism. The main character, John Ottway, is a man who has lost his faith. When he cries out to God one last time, the heavens remain silent. Ottway realizes that, somehow, the fight for survival is the only meaning there is, but this is not interpreted as a nihilistic war of all against all scenario, but rather as a good fight for kith, kin and some kind of meaning.

Overall, The Grey is a film about people, not wolves. Perhaps that's why the canines are so ghostly and demonic. They are symbols of pitiless Nature and Existence, which couldn't care less about us and our little agendas. In a post-credit scene, it's implied that Ottway survived the final confrontation with the alpha male of the wolf pack. However, the film also implies that he is terminally ill, making us wonder how long his redemption will last.

In a sense, The Grey shows how far a consistent atheist can go. It turns out to be about as far as the closest den of evil wolves...

I'm not sure whether there really is meaning in such a quest.",1437350400,,1689,4.5394736842105265

The weather is severe with blizard after blizard, also they are trespassing on a wolfpacks territory, just by being there.
it will become a fight for survival as the survivors attempt to walk to safety, however the wolves have a very different agenda.
Survival against the odds is a well troden theme in movies down the years, must admit this film is far more intense in content than most i've seen down the years.( I don't understand why many critic's under-rate the movie)

4776565,3,B005LAIIS0,"The Grey
 As humans our fear of wolves goes back a long ways, maybe all the way to our days around a campfire with nothing but pointy sticks to protect us.  The fable is Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, not the Kangaroo.  The Grey keys into this atavistic fear in the most compelling way put on film in many years.  The Grey scares the Dickens out of us.
 Liam Neeson carries this film on his own broad shoulders.  It is Liam, the wolves and some other guys.  He has been called the thinking mans action star and I will not quibble about that characterization.  He has a powerful screen presence and commands our attention whenever he appears, which is often and long-lucky for us.  The wolves are big, fierce and numerous.  Kudos must go to the wolf wranglers.  (Wouldnt wolf wrangling for the movies be a great job?)
 Writer, Director, Producer Joe Carnahan must take the credit (and the blame, as we will see) for this movie which is much more than a simple action flick.  Even the title, The Grey, is opaque.  The title might refer to the wolves, the most obvious reference.  Or, given the misty atmosphere over the landscape (supposedly wild Alaska) it might be the impenetrable terrain of the Last Frontier.  Or it may be that realm that exists, however briefly, between life and death.  Writer Carnahan very successfully collaborates with Director Carnahan to delivers not one but two very moving, careful and spiritual death scenes.  He also causes the character played by Neeson, a widowed wolf hunter in the employ of the oil companies, to explore the question most notably asked by Kilgore Trout in Venus on the Half Shell-i.e. Why is man born only to suffer and die?  You don't often get this kind of theological interest in an action flick.  This peek into human spirituality, I think, adds to the depth of the character and to our enjoyment or at least appreciation of the film.  We give a solid two and a half saw blades for The Grey.
 Why not more saw blades for this scary and thought provoking film?  As producer, Carnahan has allowed a number of real howlers to spoil his film. The Neeson character is given a job that does not exist.  Animal security is handled by the regular private security firms that are sub contractors to the oil companies.  They are uniformed guards who carry shotguns to guard against. Bears!  Wolves are just not a problem.  Also there is a bar scene early in the film in a place, an oil camp in the far Arctic, where none are allowed by local law and the preference of the oil companies.  No one in his right mind would encourage roughnecks to get drunk in camp.  They are hard enough to control when they are sober.  Maybe I wouldnt care about this stuff if I hadnt spent so many years in the Arctic oil camps myself. But in a realistic movie care is usually taken to be realistic.
 This film is rated R for violence and people being devoured by wild animals.  It runs three minutes short of two hours.  With a budget estimated at a scant $25 million it has taken in $20 million over the opening three day weekend.  As Producer, Carnahan must be smiling.  The film will surely do well and, my quibbles aside, it should do well.  We need films that examine the totality of the human condition, it does us good.",1434844800,2,3254,4.493174061433447

The wolves look like poor renditions of werewolves from outer space. I am a Liam Neeson fan, but seriously? We eventually played a game. We would fast forward and play random scenes. Every time we hit play the show took a ridiculously stupid turn within seconds.

I am an easy target for surprises in a film, however, I predicted each time a person who happened to survive this inexplicable plane crash, would die. I love good movies. I love to be surprised. Not in this silly movie. Yes, I did not predict the ending; because there wasn't one. SPOILER ALERT! The movie just stopped. Stupid, stupid, stupid. Liam Neeson's character for some reason, behaves as if he is the one who understands death, life and character of each survivor. He explains to one dying survivor of the crash, that death is a warm feeling which somehow invites you in. I believe he knows this because an ex lover, wife, sister???...not sure, dies. However, that is not explained. I guessed. Liam is not believable in this role. He is a fantastic actor, but I sensed he did his very best with what he had. I do believe, this was a low budget film. The scariest wolf is obviously a fake. We see the fake wolf at the end when Neeson is the last survivor.  I did connect with two or three survivors. I was pleased my favorite survivor, (actor in The Good Wife)waited to be the last to die an implausible death, right before the demise of Liam Neeson. After surviving the plane crash without a scratch, and harshest of the elements, shimmying across mountain tops via tied together measly pieces of cloth, The Good Wife actor, gets his foot caught between two rocks in a freezing river and drowns. Why he did not untie his boot is irrelevant in this movie. There seems to be no need to explain anything. I did watch the entire movie, mostly because I like that I predicted each demise of the survivors. I knew if my  ""Good Wife"" character  died, I would have gone to bed.

Right away, I will say I hated the ending. Why? Because it took the cheesy way out of not letting the viewer know what happened. We can assume he died, but died fighting. But we don't know.
I thought the acting was pretty good in this movie; it was the writing that was bad.
This film is intense, keeps you on the edge of your seat. BUT you will scream at the screen over the sheer dumbness of these supposedly tough men. Their airplane crashes in the frigid wilderness and not once do they think of building any kind of shelter. They make a run for the trees, pursued by wolves, and light fires for protection. When daylight comes, they are surrounded by trees and snow. But they don't lift a finger to build any kind of lean-to shack from dead branches (this is pretty easy; my brothers and I did it as kids). The coming blizzard would have plugged up any gaps and they could have stayed relatively warm and safe inside.

4776948,5,B005LAIIS0,"Not sure why so many people are giving this movie a bad rap. Most negative reviews on here are about poor CGI for the wolves, a random forest they enter, and the wolves were acting strange compared to wolves in real life. The movie wasn't supposed to be about the natural behavior of the wolves or where the crew ended up. The movie was about jon ottway coming to terms with his own reality, in fact, that goes for the majority of the crew. For Jon Ottway (liam neeson) there was no purpose in life. Once a tragic incident happened in his life, he had lost all hope. Pessimism crept into his thoughts and personality and it all began to decline from there. He then went through the attempt of suicide, the plane crash, and the killings of his crew to finally reach his concluding moments between the wolves (death) and himself (life). When he stares at the pic of his wife in an almost pensive state, and remembers the poem his father wrote, John then realized he didn't want to die yet. He wanted to conquer his fear and regain the hope he had lost. He wanted to give all he had, this final fight, for his crew and for his wife even if it meant that he may lose his life. One more battle. Into the last good fight he'll ever know. Live and die on this day.

As for another way to look at the movie would be that it's about man's struggle through life. The wolves can be depicted as ""death"" or the bad moments in life that take things away that you cherish. For example the death of a family member, losing a good friend, losing your career, divorce, etc. When these terrible moments begin to unfurl, what do you do? where do you go? When the world has practically destroyed you, what's left? You end up feeling alone and that nothing matters anymore because life ends up being **** after all.  After everyone had disappeared in front of Jon's eyes and it came down to just himself vs. the wolves (life weighing him down), he broke down and cried out to the sky because he had lost all hope at that moment, but then he finds the inner courage to carry on and push through, just like we do when we fall down: We get back up. When some of Jon's crew were sitting around towards the end of the film, realization began to dawn on them that nothing else really matters in the world except the relationships that they built with one another which essentially meant that all we have is each other in this world and there's no need to fight, hate, scorn, one another; we are all in this fight together.

The movie is moving, dismal, and has a raw look at life itself. This is not for the faint of heart because it is a sad movie overall, but still an awesome picture at the same time.",1421625600,2,2676,4.274161735700197

Neeson is great as usual, but his co-stars serves principally as meat for the terrifying ramifications of nature.

What really lets this film down are some very daft & contrived plot devices, the improbable wolf behaviour (David Attenborough would be cringing all the way through) and the shockingly bad wolf CGI and 1980's animatronics. I don't suppose they had a fraction of the budget, but the Twilight saga shows just how good CGI wolves can look.

To give you too much would be a huge spoiler for the movie especially the ending that left me gasping. The wolves are absolutely terrifying in this movie and will definitely give me nightmares.

4777291,4,B005LAIIS0,"Released in January 2012, ""The Grey"" is a somber survival flick filled with primal reflections on death and faith. Liam Neeson stars as the quasi-leader of seven misfit Alaskan oil workers who survive a plane crash in the wilderness. As if this isn't bad enough, a pack of territorial wolves want to take them out. Will they survive?

The trailer is misleading in that it advertises ""The Grey"" as an action film, but that's not the case at all. Although there is some action, this is a grave, dreary adventure with raw meditations about the will to live or die and more -- God.

It's not as good as 1997's ""The Edge,"" ""Flight of the Phoenix"" or ""Sands of the Kalahari,"" the latter two from 1965, mainly because it's so funereal and seemingly empty, but it's unique and worthwhile.

Some complain that the story's unbelievable, like the wolves and the jump from the cliff, but movies (or certain things in them) aren't always meant to be taken literally and aren't supposed to be realistic as filmmakers are more concerned with aesthetics, psychology, metaphors and conveying ideas; and that's the case with ""The Grey."" The survival story is merely a stage.

Which brings us to another common complaint, that the film's ultimately pointless, which simply isn't the case. Now you may not like the story or the points that it conveys, but it's not pointless. See my interpretation below, if interested.

The film was shot in Smithers, British Columbia, and runs 117 minutes.

GRADE: B

MY INTERPRETATION (Read only if you've seen the film):

Ottway (Neeson) is in a horrible state of grief after the passing of his beloved wife as he protects oil workers by shooting wolves that get too close to the camp. Depressed, he decides to commit suicide but before he can pull the trigger a wolf howling in the distance strangely prevents him. I believe the howling wolf was the Creator's way of speaking to Ottway and giving him a chance to go out fighting; and not just that, go out believing as well, even if it's belief in its rawest form.

The next day Ottway finds himself surviving a plane crash in the wilderness with six other men. In contrast to his near-suicide attempt, his survival instincts kick-in and he finds himself doing everything he can to survive, for himself and the others. Do you see the irony? The night before he desperately wanted to die and a mere day later he's doing everything in his power to live and save others.

The topic of God and faith comes up at a campfire. A couple of the guys believe, but Diaz naturally mocks such things. Ottway says he doesn't believe either, but wishes he could.

Later in the story, Ottway finds himself the sole survivor and at the end of his rope. Cursing, he passionately cries out to the Almighty for succor, but the heavens remain mysteriously silent. Regardless, he musters the strength to (try to) carry on. Shortly later, while reflecting on the men and their loved ones who died, he seems to clasp his hands in prayer and the Alpha wolf appears and challenges him. Unlike a few days ago when he was going to kill himself, he goes out fighting and, even more important, believing.

For those who argue that Ottway didn't believe, remember that he was praying when he was crying out to God. Yes, it was a prayer of desperation and rage, but prayer nevertheless. Job did the same thing in the bible. The utterly humbling situation drove Ottway to his Creator and compelled him to go out fighting. It was God's gift. The Almighty knew Ottway better than Ottway knew himself.",1413849600,,3533,4.671497584541063

4777294,3,B005LAIIS0,"I basically got this movie because Liam Neeson was in it. I first rented it at Red Box, and thought it was awful. This has got to be the worst Neeson film ever; and that's rare. The reason why I disliked this is because it seemed like every other word at first was F**K. I do care about foul language in a movie but when it gets repetitive it gets old. The plot was hardly there; and a pack of wolves picking off plane survivors just didn't make sense to me. It was kind of dumb, because wolves are coy; and will not bother us unless provoked. I just found the movie boring, and I agree with the critics on this one. This movie maybe good for a rental, but unless you really like it skip the purchase.

4777620,5,B005LAIIS0,"I saw this unique movie (The Grey with Liam Neeson) when it first came out and I recently bought the DVD at a bargain price.  Even though this film received mixed reviews I personally really loved it.  Liam Neesons acting is riveting in this movie as he battles the elements, the wolfs and his own psychological and emotional issues.

 This movie has a lot of tension and suspense in a tale about survival in the wilderness. Ottway (Liam Neeson) and a group of oil drillers are flying home when the plane crashes deep in the Alaska wilderness.  He realizes no one is going to find them before they all die and through the deep snow and ice he attempts to lead the injured survivors to civilization.  To make matters even more stressful, a pack of mean and vicious wolves are also hunting them.

There are also emotional and psychological factors Ottway must deal with it.  He does not believe in a supreme but at one point when he is the only one left alive he looks up and asks the mythical God for some help, which of course becomes an educated lesson in the facts of reality .  This line to me reveals everything. Ottway says at this point, NEVER MIND ILL DO IT MYSELF.

I personally liked this movie enough to also purchase it on DVD.  If you like Liam Neeson movies you will enjoy this one.  Do not turn the movie off when you think it is over, but watch it all the way through or you will miss an important last scene.

After you watch this film you'll be left questioning yourself. Liam's acting is amazing and up to par as usual. He is the reason why this film works so well, drawing from the real life tragedy of his wife passing. This film will change the way you look at thrillers.

4777649,2,B005LAIIS0,"I bought three Liam Neeson movies the other day at Walmart. The Unknown was the best of the three movies, then I guess, MAYBE, The Grey and finally Taken. This movie suffers badly first from the computer generated wolves and then from the fact that these guys should have frozen to death quite quickly. Liam's flashbacks of his wife are pretty horrible too. They are very corny and elicit more embarrassment from the viewer than empathy. The setting of oil workers in the arctic is cliched. These workers are the dregs of life that fit in nowhere. They are ex-cons, losers, outcasts, misfits. We see  all of these losers fighting in a bar or something. It looked very staged and it was quite unbelievable that these people would trash what little they had in the middle of nowhere. As a character I can't even remember what the Liam's character's problem was. Did his wife die? Is that why the character was sad? The Liam character almost shot himself in the head. He went so far as to put the rifle barrel in his mouth. Anyway, no meat at all to the plot of this movie. It is instantly forgettable and all three of the Liam Neeson movies in this review are weak but at least The Unknown has a plot and you don't know what is going on until late in the film.",1405728000,3,1258,4.399141630901288

4777655,4,B005LAIIS0,I knew this wouldn't end well. But it was watchable  and cold to view. Best to watch on a hot summer night I'm thinking.,1404864000,,120,4.0
4777656,4,B005LAIIS0,"Released in January, at first glance you think this is going to end up being a bad movie. Because previous experience tells you, that January is the dumping month for movies, the month only bad films are released in. But, that is not always the case. And I should have known better being as 'Liam Nelson' stars, and his films are usually always decent. Except for his very forgettable 'Taken 2'. So, due to the very unusual bad weather, I had nothing more to do, then to Netflix the day away. And one of the films I happened to watch was this, 'The Grey'. A film that keeps you glued to the screen until that very heart-clenching final image. Now, onto my review of 'The Grey'.

'The Grey' follows a group of oil men, who become stranded in the middle of Alaska, after their plane crashes, who are forced to adapt and survive the cruel weather, as well as a pack of viscous, gray wolves who stalk the group, helping to pick them off one by one, in a joint effort with the environment.

Together, 'The Grey' is a simple survival movie; it's just the way it is told that keeps you interested. Instead of lingering at one place for a long period of time, 'The Grey' moves at a swift pace, stopping for a breathe every once and a while. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The pacing slows when it has to, and runs the whole rest of the way with more and more obstacles popping up to try to block the path. And with that, the viewers become intertwined with the characters. You become more and more involved in the story. You sense the urgency, which is presented with the pacing.

Along the way during those times when the film feels it needs to take a breath, you learn more about the characters who are thrusted onto the game board. While it fleshes out the characters, in the end, you really have lackluster feelings about them. While you do become emotionally connected to a few of them, the others, you could care less about, they're just there to build up the body bags, and add up the sense of necessarity for the important, more emotionally connect characters to survive. In the end, as the characters start being pulled out of the game, you feel little to nothing for them, as they end up just being pieces in a puzzle.

However, while the characters are lackluster, the actors try their best to better themselves. 'Liam Nelson' leads the film with veteran ease, quickly becoming necessary for survival, as well as, emotionally connected to him. He played out as the kind of guy you want to lead you, the kind of hard guy with a sad past. The rock. Nelson again proves he has a great ability to lead a film, as well as to make chemistry with his co-stars out of thin air. Of his co-stars 'Frank Grillo' comes to mind, as the scared, aggressive, mean, and sarcastic survivor of the plane crash, who questions Nelson's leadership qualities several times. He has a way of coming off as unlikable, and then turning slowly into a more insecure, sad guy. He plays off well enough and holds his own up until his end. And as for the rest of the cast, well they did decent performances, just not ones I'm willing to take the time to note in particular.

The direction from, 'Joe Caranhan' works well. Coming off of 'The A-Team' he tackles his follow-up, 'The Grey'. And succeeds in creating a fairly good film. He knew exactly what he was doing and how to do it, and the film ended up coming out completely how it might as it would in reality. He knew what angles he wanted to take, and where he wanted his cast and crew to be.

A problem the film has is the editing. Some of it comes out as glitchy, and when you watch the men fight the wolves in a few of the scenes, the shots kind of go too quickly or to slowly, and don't roll out perfectly smooth. Some of the shots come off rough, and not smooth and flowing.

The film does feature of the note music, composed by 'Marc Streitenfeld'. The music fits the scenes, and raises the thrill level. It adds emotional depth when necessary but doesn't go overboard, or get too deep and loud, as most survival movie music tends to go. It underplays the film, coming in slowly, and never getting very loud, but just high enough to help make your heart jump.

Some may agree but others may disagree about the subject of the film's abrupt ending. Our lead ends up face to face with the leader of the pack of wolves, he takes out his knife and they stare down each other, and when he's just about to charge the beast, the film cuts to black. I have to say I was left bewildered by the ending, as I expected the usual, of which he gets saved and bla-bla-bla unoriginal ending. But instead we get this, and the viewer is left to guess the fate of its lead. It's a bit disappointing for someone interested in seeing the lead finally reach some sort of peaceful resolution after so much hardship and suffering, but no. We never know what became of him. If he survived or if he died. Now I have to say it works and doesn't. It seems to conclude the film, but not. The film ducks out of the fight at the last moment, when it could have had a more drawn out conclusion. It is original, and keeps you in, but seems disappointing and lazy as well.

All and all, 'The Grey' works as a solidly built survival movie lead by an impressive performance from 'Liam Nelson, and good pacing and character development, but we all wish the characters were alittle less unlikable and the editing more smooth and clean.

4777867,4,B005LAIIS0,"Before you view this film, be aware that this film is not for the faint hearted. Take these words as they are given, and do not even rent the film if you are squeamish. If you are prepared, this is a film that might bring you to your knees. It will leave you with a sense of foreboding.

Liam Neeson is one of those actors that can take this kind of material and make it his own. He plays Ottaway, a man who has not much to live for, has gone to the wilds of Alaska to work for an oil drilling company. In the company of misfits and men who may be criminals or worse. Ottaway was hired as a marksman to shoot the wildlife that preyed upon the men as they worked. He is good at his job. The title of the film refers to wolves, 'The Grey' ones. This is a group of animals who travel in packs, are always hungry and will do whatever it takes to feed their hunger. In a sense that's exactly what this group of men have become. Ottaway seems suicidal, we see him put his gun in his mouth, but at the last minute he removes the barrel.

Ottaway and a group of men are on their way to Fairbanks, the plane is being de-iced as we see the men board. This is a bumpy ride, none like I have seen before, and at the end of the bump, the plane gives down. Most of the men die, 7 live with various sorts of wounds. They find a bit of the plane and climb in for shelter. In the morning they find one of them killed by the wolves. They decide to move on, to try to find their way out of this wilderness. This is the story, this is their story, foraging through the wilderness, fighting off packs of wolves who are following them day and night. Building fires and fighting for their lives. Pretty tough stuff I kept looking for a silver lining.

Whatever you do, sit and watch this film through the credits to the very last scene which arrives in the very last minute.

4778260,3,B005LAIIS0,"The main reason to watch this movie is because Liam Neeson is in it. He really commits to every row and is so good in all his action flicks. Story line of this movie is a bit sparse: John Mogway (Liam Neeson) works in Alaska or some icy land and his job is to shoot wolves that are vicious and prey on the workers there. He gets on a  plane that crashes and only he and six other guys survive. They end up in the snowy environs and are being hunted by a pack of wolves who dominate this territory. They are picked off one at a time and he ends up last man standing as each die in some gruesome way.

This movie is MUCH deeper than a plane crashing and men stuck in the bitter cold wilderness while fighting wolves. So close to death, how will one respond?

Towards the end, Neeson, after all his fellow workers have died, asks god to do something, show him something, prove he actually exists and he'll believe for the rest of his life..............

God never answers. I know, shocker. If any one of us are in that same situation, the same result will happen: death. This movie really makes you think, I mean really deep. Five stars!",1392336000,,719,4.558139534883721

There are a lot of wildly varied reviews on this movie and I have no interest in being drawn into an argument over this one, as in over an ok movie. Be honest, it was ok but nothing more. Liam Neeson is great as always but for the life of me I can't remember anyone else who was in it so I think that makes a statement right there. Plane crash, wolves, snow, wolves, darkness, wolves, death, wolves, then a little twist at the end.

4778329,5,B005LAIIS0,"A lot of bad reviews for this movie, and I honestly can't understand why.  Yeah it's a little rough around the edges, and some of the dialogue seems unnecessarily vulgar.  It is a movie about the dregs of society, the lowest of the low.  Liam Neeson's character says so at the beginning.  If they talked like members of a family sitcom, then it just wouldn't fit.  It's a true ""Man Vs. Nature"" type movie, and is Liam Neeson's best movie to date in my opinion.  It may seem a little slow paced for a typical thriller, and that's because it is not a typical thriller.  It's depth is far beyond the everyday thriller, and people need to understand that before buying this movie.  It's not a simple thriller, and not for someone looking for a simple thriller.",1390521600,,756,4.467153284671533

However, this cannot compensate for the movies extremely depressing view of life in general, and it's correspondingly depressing ending. Some of the points made in this movie go beyond the reasonable. A character for example points out that his working class life is not a life worth living and concludes he therefore may as well die in the wilderness. The movie almost transcends into a parody of extremely bad outcomes. I really can't see any good reasons what-so-ever for spending any time watching this move.

4778583,4,B005LAIIS0,"A group of men are trudging through knee deep snow. Night is soon falling and it's only going to get colder. To make matters worse, a pack of wolfs are on the hunt, their habitat has been interrupted by these intruders. As the group of men trudge through the blinding snow,  the wolves barrel down on the person trailing behind the others. He's to far behind for the other men to reach in time. This scene exemplifies the tone of the grey, a movie about a group of oil workers who crash land in the frozen wasteland of Alaska. We know that these men are on borrowed time. In a lesser film, the struggle would seem pointless or far too grim. However,  the Grey manages to give the dire situation a sense of beauty through camera work, editing, music and cinematography. For example, there is one scene where the men must cross a chasm.  They make a rope to span it, however, the last man has acrophobia. He becomes so keen on his surroundings that time seems to slow down, the snow flurry becomes a collection of visible snow flakes. He drops his glasses and the sound is amplified.  The rope eventually breaks and he crashes to the ground. He sees a ghostly vision of his daughter before the wolves take him away. In a film about the fight for survival, death often seems to be the only peaceful part of their reality. Perhaps the bleakest part of the film is not the cold or the wolves, but how it shows the audience how indifferent nature, the world, the universe is to our suffering. There is no deity coming to rescue. As the friend of Liam Neeson's character drowns in a river, he looks up and screams at god for help but sees only a vast indifferent void.",1388361600,,1661,4.383116883116883

The characters were well developed to the point that you start caring about them and what happens to them in the story. The director place you there with the men in the freezing Alaskan wilderness with the amazing cinematography. I believe most of the hate behind The Grey comes from people not being prepared for what they got from the movie. Meaning, people weren't ready for the dark gritty depressing tone of The Grey. The Grey is a really intense personal movie about a man finding a purpose in his life after his problems in life as he struggles to lead the people he is with to survival.",1388016000,,676,4.373015873015873

4778663,4,B005LAIIS0,"I bought The Grey knowing exactly how it was going to go and how it ended. I bought it anyway. Liam Neeson gives a powerful performance as John Ottway. Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo, Dallas Roberts and Nonso Anozie are superb. The winter location sites in the movie are amazing and downright frightening. Even the howling wind sounds alive and menacing, and I think that's one of the things that bothers people about this film. Mother Nature is bigger than we are. She doesn't give a care about us. The Grey is not some Disney flick, the calvary does not show up in the last five minutes, but the ending was totally in line with the rest of the movie: keeping (or losing) your faith while facing the end of your life. When Ottway is finally alone and he calls out to the Almighty I felt his pain. I also understand his rage when he doesn't get a response. It's like the Big Guy upstairs just can't be bothered to listen. I've felt that way sometimes too.

I had no problem with the violence, and I have to laugh at people who bitterly complained about that. So what were you expecting, folks? This movie is bloody. Get over it. I like wolves and I can understand all the outrage about the demonic way they were portrayed in this one. but that's just it: this is a movie. Something had to be the heavy in this thing, and aside from the hostile mountain terrain the wolves were the obvious choice to be the bad guys. Let's face it, would people pay good money to watch nearly two hours of these actors falling off a mountainside or freezing to death? I don't think so. People who watched The Grey came for the carnage, not Masterpiece Theater. Check your sense of self-righteous outrage at the door.

Or go watch another movie with an upbeat ending. I'd recommend ""Pacific Rim"" or ""Man of Steel.""

The sound effects and the mountain visuals sent chills down my spine, but my only problem is that sometimes the wolf effects looked fake to me. Do wolves act like this in real life? Probably not. Humans always demonize other groups (human and non-human). Makes it easier to justify atrocities and species extermination. I will say though that I wouldn't blame animals (coyotes, whales, wolves, etc) if they were sick and tired of humans and decided to give back to us what we've been doing to them for hundreds of years.

That said, this is a depressing movie if you're looking for a straight-on action flick. But if you're in the mood for brilliant acting, fast paced action and thought-provoking dialogue, then The Grey is definitely for you.",1386979200,,2540,4.5514223194748356

The reason I gave this film five stars is because i liked the premise, a man trying to find solace and/or redemption, thrust into a very bad situation and what then proceeds to happen, i thought the direction was great, the acting was excellent and the overall atmosphere of the movie was engaging.

4778670,5,B005LAIIS0,"This is a visceral film that hits you, like a sledgehammer, in the guts from the beginning. Like an earlier, yet lesser film, made in the same genre with Val Kilmer and Mike Douglas, ""The Ghost and the Darkness"", it has an incredible problem out of the gate, in that you respect the Wolves and also their valiant attempt to protect their rightful habitat, but you don't want these characters to be killed by them. Nevertheless, This film is a real grabber: There is a plane crash, at the beginning, of the most terrific and horrible magnitude, (please stand back, ""Flight of the Phoenix""). Then, there is only the dreadful cold, unrelenting, with the chase of the Wolves intent to kill every survivor of the crash. Liam Neeson, as he says early in the film is ""cursed by the Damned"". He is being pursued by the very animal that he has been paid, by a huge oil company, to kill as protector of the oil drillers, so irony abounds. He, really, is at his best here, and I believe given the flash-backs of his ""film-wife"", this must have been a very poignant and moving experience for him, personally, and I think that is reflected in his intense acting skills, so exhibited. This is a gritty, semi-epic, that deserves respect for it's terrific sense of Tragedy in a Wilderness, where mankind is totally abstracted from it's element. Very like a London or Hemingway novel, it spares no mercy for the plight of Man in the Wilderness, with only fire, and their fists to fight off the inevitable prey. Excellent, all the way through.",1385510400,,1525,4.610294117647059

The second time I watched it I was more impressed with the movie in it's entirety because of the theme of human survival against all odds.

If any animal is hungry yes they will attack even me. but this movie was so unlike wolves. first wolves will avoid people. alfa's are more bold but still alaska has enough food for them. i hate the witch hunts they have on wolves. wolves keep our coyote populations down. most ranchers lookat wolves being at fault for what coyotes damage does. if an animal is weak or sick it needs to die.,1383523200,,716,4.158273381294964

It could've been good if the plane crash survivors had come up with some smart, successful ways to fend off the pack and maybe find a way for at least some of them to escape their predicament/get rescued. But no, the battle is almost completely one-sided, and absolutely everybody dies, including Neeson.

Might be halfway cool if you're fascinated with downer films and death, as this is kind of a 'nature gets even with man' snuff film. But boring, preposterous, pretentious, and downright silly to everyone else. Also misrepresents wolves and actual wolf behavior in a pretty major way.

4778813,5,B005LAIIS0,"The Grey is an outstanding movie.  It takes the deepest fears of humanity and lays them bare for all to see like the wreckage of an airplane on a glacier.

The story revolves around an Irish hunter hired by an oil company to protect drillers in the Arctic spaces of the North American continent.  He gets on a plane with his co-workers all manly, blue collar men who make up the Armed Forces, keep the streets in good repair, etc.  These are the un-tamed, un-PC (mostly) white men of America who themselves can tame nature and laugh at death-if only for a while.

The plane crashes.  The crash scene is portrayed with a stark realism.  The survivors must now face death and nature.  The survivors head away from the aircraft to find help.  One-by-one wolves start to chase them and pick them off.

They plead for help from the almighty but do not get it.  The existentialism of this movie is a theme alongside primal fear.  Indeed existentialist philosophy is itself a study of fear.

The ending of this movie matches what one expects and encourages all to meet their fate bravely.

As some seen from the trailer, wolves will be playing somewhat the main role in the movie. They will be done with very good special effects, and they will be far from the wolves you see in real life. They will be very cruel. While I don't like this part because it promotes hatred towards animals and these species in general I liked the fact that humans in general will get their soft places kicked real hard. It's a good addition to today's movies. Finally it goes the other way around than what we used to see on Tv. The characters are likable. The movie falls perfectly between a good and a bad movie. It's a fine movie (3-4 stars). Since the movie is quite dark and depressing it's not surprise that in general it's rated 3 stars. The movie is really good, but I don't like depressing movies. Anyway it's a movie that I recommend but not to everyone. You might get something useful out of it, that is if you like thinking of course. Needless to say, acting was quite good!

Judging from many of the other reviews, I guess you're only going to enjoy The Grey as much as your 'let-precise/accurate-physics-rest-for-a-while-and-just-enjoy-the-show' meter will allow (like an 80's movie where people just let a little imagination fill in the gaps and moved on). Expect nothing going in and just observe where it goes. It definitely gets there.

To me, The Grey feels like a philosophical kick in the balls that didn't, doesn't, and most likely won't apologize. If you're of a religious nature, you may find it somewhat offensive (Neeson pretty much bypasses all bs and puts God on the spot), but it realistically/indifferently approaches a subject that many people would LIKE to think positively about.

Neeson comes off to me as an 'optimistic cynic' who choses to advance onward in spite of his less than kind surrounding and situation (this actually makes for fascinating chemistry between him and the group's human antagonist who shares some of his views). While a few in the group try to place some special significance on their survival (which mother nature and misfortune work hand in hand to counter) Neeson weathers it all and keeps them going. Things don't improve (at all) but the 'if ya want something done right, do it yourself' mentality Neeson displays made me wanna cheer him on til the end.

Like I said, don't expect anything and just see where it goes. *spoilers- if you can really appreciate the significance of the poem Lian speaks of, then it really doesn't matter WHAT happens to him in the end (though the last scene after the credits may make you smile an evil smile.) ^_~",1367798400,,1646,4.970909090909091

If you are looking for adrenaline rushes and blood spilling, you will be disappointed in The Grey. OTOH, if you bring your brain along for the ride and can put yourself in Liam's character's shoes from the moment you push play, this movie is refreshingly different and original.  He is already hollow from loss and numbed out before choosing to work in a place that is freezing cold, desolate, dark and dreary. His job is to protect not-so-lovable people. A horrible accident throws them into survival mode. But they are not alone. And it is a long way to civilization. If it came to that, how would people really react?

Nesson gives a commendable performance as professional wolf killer Ottway. Even though we don't know either of them well enough for it to be really meaningful, the way his estranged wife acts as a guardian angel to him is an interesting conceit. Realistic oil roughneck acting and dialogue despite the fact that most of the supporting characters tend to run together and, plane crash notwithstanding, seldom complete a sentence without two or three f-bombs.

This film is undeniably realistic in many ways; in many others, it's very unconvincing. It's tense and compelling thanks mostly to fine camera work and stage directions, but there are a number of annoying short-cuts and cop-outs. The best aspect of THE GREY is its forbiddingly beautiful Alaskan scenery--the cinematography really outshines the plot. Though I didn't care much for the ending, I have to say that it is both surprising and fitting for this film's whole Hemingwayesque tone and atmosphere (humankind against the dispassionate wild and all that sort of stuff). For all its mediocrity, I have to say that I'm glad I saw THE GREY.

4779411,2,B005LAIIS0,"I don't mind the odd break from realistic films with a cheesy animal slasher flick where the animals are determined to kill off every human in the film. But you need the non animal parts of the film to be at least slightly plausible to work, and you also need them to be fun to watch, such as was done with Snakes on a Plane or Bait (sharks in a supermarket). Even Jaws where Bruce went on a killing spree, at least the human and town parts came across as somewhat realistic. But this one just doesn't make sense at all, every intelligent things a survivor of a plane crash should do starting off with never leave the crash site so rescuers will find you is ignored, everything that should kill you doesn't such as a couple of minutes in a freezing river and no way to get warm immediately after, jumping off a cliff into a tree. That's not even mentioning how a bit of paper survives the whole film intact. Yet the whole film has a serious tone to it. The writers needed to make a decision, are we making a fun cartoon style film or a serious one. For large parts of the film to be accepted by the viewer we needed straight away to believe we were watching a cartoon type unrealistic world with humans and real life non cartoon scenery.

Deleted scenes we should have seen in the film which may have let the viewer buy the events of the rest of the film for example - we should have seen where a wolf after seeing the other wolf that was shot for no apparent reason at the start of the film, getting on a phone and calling the alpha wolf telling him his daughter, sister or whoever has just been murdered and his killer is about to get on a plane flying over their den, or maybe they could have done this through a relay of howls or something. The wolves coming up with a way to bring down the plane and scenes of them doing it, maybe highpawing each other when they do it. Some plausible reason why the humans can't stay with the wreckage and leave the most easily defendable against killer wolves and the elements shelter. A plausible destination that the group was actually trying to reach, rather than just venturing into more and more remote wilderness, such as known bankrupt still intact winter holiday camp or something.

The Grey as a dark psychological film if that's what is was supposed to be probably would have worked better as a simple survival film without the ridiculous non realistic wolves at all and simply focused on the men trying to survive against the elements, hunger, cliffs, rivers and even each other.",1363737600,,2530,4.392324093816631

The wolves are not wolves. they are your end. they are merciless nature. they are the fact of your mortality, and as the masks fall awayand the characters die one by one, we come closer and closer to a fundamental truth about mortality: we die alone. so who are we when we die? the truth of us all lies in that moment. this is a rare picture, friends -- an exciting adventure story of survival that is entertaining and deeply philisophical, if you have eyes to see and ears to hear. not to mention the entire cast is superb, as is the writing. sometimes it's fun to turn on a movie and escape. sometimes it's good to be poked in the heart and think, and feel things on a spiritual plane. this movie will take you there.",1361232000,2,1017,4.414893617021277

4779708,1,B005LAIIS0,"This movie could have benefitted from several consultants.  I fly medevac planes over all of Alaska, and I will give you my top ten reasons why this movie isn't worth the plastic box it comes in...

1.  The north slope has no mountains, or trees... and wolves only when the Caribou are migrating through, which doesn't happen in winter.  No one hires wolf snipers to protect oil workers.
2.  The first trees they come to (after leaving the slope) are huge conifers.  You have to fly over about 200 miles of tiny black spruce to get to any large trees.  Then to a canyon?  with a river with running water in winter??  Spring in the Bob Marshal wilderness in Montana maybe... but not up here.  Sorry.
3.  Liam just walks out of the river, and keeps on keeping on.  His clothes are dry in a few minutes.  Liam, Liam, Liam.  You need a fire.
4.  When the impossible 85 foot long jump has occurred, everyone decides to go across the contrivance feet first.  When you survive YOUR wolf saga, go head first.  It works better.
5.  Spend some time around oil roughnecks.  They are not soft voiced touchy feeling sorts.  The river scene when the biggest jerk of them all gets sort of tired and gives up is overdone.  Reality?  I would have stabbed him in the brainstem a couple of days earlier when he started to ruin morale.  There is also a scene whereupon these ""toughened brawlers"" are getting grossed out by (the biggest jerk) by him decapitating a wolf that they have killed and cooked as a statement.
6.  You don't outrun wolves.  Neither do you hear them crashing about in the woods.
7.  The Alpha wolf looks just about like the Wolf from ""Fantastic Mr. Fox""; and sounds like a mother elephant urging her young toward the next watering hole.  What... real wolves aren't scary enough?  If you can afford Liam, you can afford some better special effects.
8.  Liam pets the first wolf dispatched, with his hunting rifle, while sort of weepy, until it is dead.  If a wolf is breathing after you have shot it with a deer rifle, you shouldn't pet it.  I think it is just taking a nap.
9.  Why beat the black guy in the chest sorrowfully after he is dead?  They weren't close when they were alive... and a luckily placed precordial thump only works if you do it once... and not when you have died from Hypoxia... only when you are in active V-tach.
10.  I could care less about any of the characters.  Apparently Liam has a beautiful wife/SO somewhere, who left him.  If you get to have a chance with a beautiful woman who wants to hold you and stroke your face on clean white linens, you don't say to her ""my Irish blood can't stand it here... I have to go be a wolf sniper on the north slope-""  You say ""baby, should I make you an omelette""?  and then you let her decide what to watch on TV.  Forever.

4779751,5,B005LAIIS0,"Let's be honest.  The Grey wasn't ever going to be a movie that was marketed towards Christian audiences.  The use of raw, guttural language is only slightly less pervasive than that found in your average Tarantino film.  And as for the violence?  Well, how many Christians typically revel in a film in which the main characters are brutally eliminated in often grotesque fashion by a pack of ravenous wolves?  No.  This is most certainly not Fireproof and it is definitely not Courageous.  This is not filmmaking that is methodically geared to sentimentally reinforce everything a Christian already believes to be true.  This is filmmaking on the level of Roland Joffe's The Mission or Terrence Malick's The Tree of Life.  And for Christians that love the medium of film and for Christians that long for a film to seriously explore the theological problem of pain, The Grey is exactly the kind of movie that you are looking to see.  It's a film that refuses to offer overly-simplistic answers; and it's a film that gives equal voice to both the faithful and the atheist alike.  Consider the words of writer/director Joe Carnahan:

""If an atheist sees this film, they say, `There's no way [Liam Neeson's character] believes in God.'  [But when] the most hardcore Christian sees this film, they say, `Absolutely he believes in God!' ...  This is the way of the universe and certainly it's the way of nature.  Nothing is given.  Nothing is certain.  And I think that as you get older you start to think about things ... There are things that start to occur to you where you go, `What's out there? What's waiting for me? What's the afterlife look like? Is there an afterlife?'""

If that kind of mentality doesn't excite you as a Christian fan of film, than this is not likely the movie for you to see.  But if you appreciate harrowing survivalist tales in which man must not only face the demons of nature, but his fragile belief in the existence and goodness of the divine, The Grey is is a must-see.  Raw, uncompromising, and built with a fine-tuned precision towards a beautifully executed smash-cut ending, The Grey should rightfully take its place alongside the very best films of 2012.

4779755,1,B005LAIIS0,What a gripping film about man's desire to survive and his acceptance of death.  I've watched this dvd 3 times and still  find more to think about each time.  Scenery is beautiful and the wolf robots are amazingly real.,1358726400,,219,4.564102564102564
4779756,5,B005LAIIS0,"John Ottway (Liam Neeson) is a washed up and depressed roughneck working in Arctic Alaska where he provides security to oil workers. The morose loner gets on a flight to head back home, presumably to his wife (Anne Openshaw), who we consistently see in the flashbacks and dreams of Ottway. Fate intervenes as the plane crashes in an icy tundra, and Ottway is one of several survivors. They team up to trek towards safety but Ottway's experience and survival instincts will be put to the test as they may be encroaching on the nest of a vicious pack of wolves.

Disaster and survival movies are often some of the laziest potboilers in the film industry, but The Grey features an intelligently brooding script with fleshed out characters, superb performances, great stunts and sets, stark cinematography and a good measure of philosophy and poetry. There is a palpable quality to the film's setting. There is a really chilling realism to the film's atmosphere and I was really drawn in this adventure as this group of men flee the elements and the ravenous wolves. Speaking of, the one slight flaw in the film is the exaggerated and fictional characteristics of wolves. The otherwise outstanding script at one point claims that wolves are the only non-human species to seek revenge. Come on! Although to be fair, Joe Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers created a wonderful script.

Early in the film, one of the heaviest and authentic death scenes in a film is shown as Neeson's Ottway consoles a man in the ruins of the plane crash who is close to death. This is an intense film; more so from the fears, dread, pain and inner struggles of the characters than the fight between man and nature. There are intelligent exchanges between the men as they sit fearfully around a campfire either confessing their fears and mortality or boasting a false bravado of fearlessness. The acting is solid across the board, but Neeson and Frank Grillo stand out in their performances. Grillo plays the token jerk of the survivors' group, at least at first, but his character has depth behind the sarcastic cynicism. In fact, all the characters are treated as their own person, not thrown together cliches or sacrificial lambs. Other films, particularly disaster or ensemble films, ought to take notice. Overall, The Grey is a forceful journey of existentialism, wonder and terror in a cold and unforgiving place where men find their own existences and meanings to be as transient as the snow under their feet.",1358640000,5,2491,4.872641509433962

4779849,5,B005LAIIS0,"Intellectual, visceral, intriguing and emotional. You will be in this film as you experience the turbulent events. Fascinating for myself having recently watched and reviewed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hunter-HD/dp/B008Q0D2QU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hunter [HD</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Headhunters-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B00932AA5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Headhunters (With English Subtitles)</a>.

Discount 'Headhunters' as a comparison since that film is straight forward man against man action caper. The link with 'The Hunter' is worthwhile for they both are journeys of the mind along rugged and unspoilt terrain. I knew nothing of The Grey save for it being supermarket cheap, has Liam Neeson and something about wolves. I shan't spoil it for you with further elucidation. Suffice it to say that it is much, much more than that.

Really excellent soundtrack will test your speaker system. What I got from it most of all was the real emotional pull that comes from understanding how beautiful we are as individual human beings. So many beautiful lives have ended. Will always end. Real life is so far, far away from our media frenzy. Money means nothing. Nothing.

When I read about this movie I wasn't sure it was something I really wanted to watch, but once I did I was totally taken in by the story. I would highly recommend it for adventure lovers or anyone just wanting to watch something with an unusual twist. The wolves, which I'm sure were digitally made, seemed a little large to me, but that only added to the suspense and fright of the story.

4779983,4,B005LAIIS0,"I will preface this review by saying that Liam Neeson is probably one of my favorite movie tough guys working today.  When I hear that there was a movie out there that had him against a bunch of wolves, I was excited for the wold beatdown that I was about to witness.  I imagined Mr. Neeson going Rambo on these wolves, yelling, ""they drew first blood, not me!!!""  I imagined him as some type of wilderness MacGuyver, whittling sticks and creating weapons of natural desctruction to take on his enemies.  Hey, I'm an animal lover, but I'm all for some movie magic involving some man versus wolf action.  I was pretty surprised (okay, maybe not THAT surprised) when the film did not turn out exactly like I had thought it would.

This movie is actually pretty emotional.  And not in an, ""awww, poor guy/wolves,"" kind of way, more like a kick to the gut every now and then kind of way.  This was less action, more drama, and I loved every minute of it.  There is a little bit of gore in here, just in case you are squeamish, but it is not too bad.  The part of the movie leading up to the group being stranded in the wilderness is also pretty intense.  I enjoyed watching these people try to survive in this wilderness, and I genuinely felt for some of the characters when they were inevitably gobbled up by the wolves.  I can think of one death in particular in which I wanted to go full Darth Vader and scream, ""Nooooooooo,"" but luckily for those around me, I was able to contain it.

I would recommend this movie if you're into tales of survival.  It is a pretty long movie, at just under 2 hours, but It did not feel like it was that long.  Those are my favorite kind of movies.  The acting is pretty good, even if there are some cheesy tough guy archetype moments.  The tough guy former inmate kind of irked me for a few minutes, but I even started to like him after a while.

Go ahead and check this out on a cold and snowy night, and you will feel happy that you are indoors watching a movie and not stranded in some beautiful wilderness somewhere, with trees and mountaing, and wolves, oh my!!!  Actually, if you take away the stalking wolves, it sounds like a pretty decent vacation.  Do yourself a favor and bundle up and watch this flick!!!",1357603200,2,2249,4.3349282296650715
4779984,2,B005LAIIS0,"In The Grey, Liam Neeson plays the lead character based in the harsh, cold area of Alaska. It depicts men against beasts, men against the elements, and I guess men against themselves. The story begins slowly showing the lead character torn and hurting, but I have yet to understand why the lead character felt this way or was trying to kill himself. The story moves on to where the lead characters and the other men he works with are in a plane crash. They all eventually succumb to death by the wolves that is tracking them, the severe cold, or the environment. The lead character that Mr. Neeson plays eventually outlasts everyone, and he faces the alpha male of the wolf pack at the end. Then the movie cut to the scene with his wife again, a saline drip, and I don't know what that all meant. I guess she was died?

For me, the story was disconnected. If the filmmakers were trying to make a point, I totally missed it. I will say that Mr. Neeson is an excellent actor, and he is the only reason why I watched the entire thing. I thought his character was very intelligent and no nonsense. He tells it like it is throughout the film, and I liked that about his character.

But overall, I didn't like the movie. I felt like it wasn't finished. It didn't put everything together for me, and that's what I expected. Well, maybe it was, and I missed it. Anyway, enjoy if you watch.

4779986,5,B005LAIIS0,"I almost didn't watch the DVD. I was alone in my house, at night -- did I really want to watch a desperate struggle between man and wolf, on my big TV with full surround sound? Maybe it would be too intense -- too painful.

It was indeed intense, and at times painful. But it was also beautiful, and compelling.

The men -- hardened oil workers at an isolated outpost whose plane crashes on the way back to Anchorage -- are dropped into a terrible situation. In the end, they maintain their humanity. They admit how much they want to survive, to see their child again, or to have sex one more time. They admit how scared they are. They ... well, you should see it for yourself.

At one point, I found myself thinking that the title was poorly chosen. I thought ""The Grey"" referred to one giant alpha wolf, with whom Liam Neeson's character would go one on one. And when that didn't seem to be happening, I felt misled.

But then I thought, maybe the title actually refers to Neeson's character. He is, in a way, caught between life and death, between blackness and color. Maybe he's The Grey.

The film is also, in part, anti-religious, while being deeply humanistic. Neeson's character finds value in the immediate physical truths of life, and the human connections, rather than thoughts of the hereafter.",1357430400,,1306,4.564102564102564

This is a brave, honest, beyond moving meditative piece about male spirituality. This is existential psychotherapy at its absolute finest. This movie is everything Rollo May, Irvin D. Yalom, and Viktor Frankl were talking about. This is us facing our mortality ( and overcoming our fear of it) and finding meaning and purpose in our life, even in the direst of circumstances. We all walk into the den at some point. We have to find bravery and purpose in our marrow.

Maybe I didn't like this movie because I've read so many non-fiction books on this subject, and this is more like a unrealistic horror movie.  Honestly, if you were trapped in the Alaskan wilderness the last thing you'd be worried about is wolves.  The movie makes it seem like it would basically be a walk in the park if not for the super smart wolves that always seems to be in the right place.  Little to no talk of freezing to death, starving, physical exhaustion, frostbite, etc.  Some of the guys are wearing baseball caps or no hats at all, and seem to be doing just fine except for the wolves.  At least they talked about elevation sickness for a moment, and then the guy died.  I understand that using the wolf as the villain helps sell tickets, and I don't have a problem with a movie exaggerating certain things for entertainment value, but I felt like they missed an opportunity to highlight the challenges people would actually face.  Keep some wolves for drama, but explore the idea that climbing down the side of a mountain in Alaska in the dead of winter would be challenging without the wolves.  Maybe I'm being too critical, but I felt like the story would have been richer if it were a little more realistic.",1356739200,,1325,4.529411764705882

4780380,2,B005LAIIS0,"Here's the issue with ""The Grey""--either you buy into the idea that this movie is in fact more than just a poorly executed tale of wilderness survival, that it is actually an existential consideration of the human condition and the significance we must extract from our struggle to defeat the absurd obstacles life throws in our way.

I don't buy it.

Perhaps it's the choice of the villain in this film. Wolves already get a bad enough rap in our culture. Here they are cast as bloodthirsty predators who hunt humans for sport (but wait--maybe they're metaphors for humans...the only species that hunts for sport...nah, that doesn't work either). To confuse matters even more, some attacks that are filmed to look brutally deadly turn out to be anything but. And then there's the confusing matter of Liam Neeson's lost love. I don't begrudge a film its effective use of ambiguity, but when that ambiguity turns to obscurity and seems to unnecessarily complicate the plot and the protagonist's character development...well, then I take issue.

""The Grey"" has actually turned up on a few critics' end-of-year ""Best of"" lists, so I took a chance and watched it in spite of the panning it had received from so many other critics.

The film is completely unrealistic and beyond boring.

The special effects are like from the dollar store. In one scene, the eyes of the wolf pack lighting up is laughable as they look exactly like a bunch of lights. They are all exactly spaced apart perfectly with the same amount of light ""reflected"" in their eyes. Just eyes, no wolves.

So many stupid moments, like let's all sleep inside the plane wreckage but leave one guy outside in the arctic weather as a ""lookout"". A lookout for what?

Then of course there is the classic ""Let's move to the trees because the wolves don't want us here"" line, which should haunt Mr. Neeson for the rest of his career.

The film plausibly sets up a brutal crisis situation, but soon drifts off into fantasy, as escaping the wolves becomes the paramount concern.

With a strong cast headed by Liam Neeson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Taken/dp/B001GCUNYO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Taken</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-A-Team/dp/B004856SQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The A-Team</a>), this gritty adventure is engaging, features some scenic cinematography, and definitely delivers some thrills.  Unfortunately, the unrealistic behavior of the wolves, and other discordant elements, along with some less than convincing special effects, soon distract from what could have been a more solid story.

A group of oil company workers at a remote Alaskan camp, are on a night flight bound for civilization, when the plane unexpectedly develops problems, and crashes in the snow covered woods.  Only a handful survive, and John Ottway (Neeson), whose job is to hunt and kill wolves around the camp, emerges as the leader of the group.  Huddled in the wreckage of the plane, keeping warm is the initial priority, but after the survivors are challenged by a pack of wolves, and the animals kill  one of the group during the night, Ottway decides that retreat is their only hope.

Supposedly acting to protect their territory, the wolves follow, and aggressively strike when the opportunity presents itself, further reducing the group's numbers.  The survivors eventually are forced to take desperate measures, but no matter what they do, they can't escape the pursuing wolves.

The Grey has some great natural settings, and with a solid supporting cast that includes Frank Grillo, Dermont Mulroney, and Dallas Roberts, the acting is pretty good.  With the action largely driven by the ""unlikely"" behavior of the wolves, which in turn results in some strange actions by the survivors, the film's credibility is severely undermined.  Early on, Ottway is attacked by a wolf, and incredibly suffers absolutely no harm, as the group mostly fails to arm themselves.  The cold hardly seems to have an effect on the men, even after taking a dip in a chilly river.  Then when the story attempts to weave in spiritual and religious elements, it's difficult to take seriously, as things have already strayed away too far.  The mostly unconvincing CG wolves, are another major distraction.

Competently made, and with some exciting moments, The Grey is entertaining, although it's more of a wilderness fantasy, who's ""message"" may largely be lost in the swirling Alaskan winds.  Rating: 3.5 stars.",1355011200,,2847,5.661176470588235

Liam Neeson is awesome in this. His character is plausibly thoughtful, more because of his interpretation than the writing itself. I always liked Neeson, but his ""tough guys"" always seemed to be slightly undermined by some undercurrent of bookishness in his personality. In The Grey he found a credible balance that he usually misses, and that was fun to watch.

It's absolutely true that some of the plot turns were nonsensical. The wolves didn't exactly act like wolves (more like the velociraptors in Jurassic Park). The people didn't exactly act like people (sure, I'll jump 50 feet across a canyon into a tree for no apparent reason). In the end though, they were both close enough.

4780891,4,B005LAIIS0,"Initial trailers misled the public into thinking this would be Liam Neeson reenacting Taken with Wolves replacing the Albanians.  It's set up as if he gets put in a wolf-punching contest, and spends the next hour and a half making pelts with nothing more than his bare hands and a gravely voice.  Unfortunately for many (pleasant surprise for me), The Grey is a much more complex movie than initially believed.  The film is less about survival, and more about the psychological struggle man must ponder when confronted with inevitable death.

What isn't really changed, however, is how awesome Neeson is.  He's every bit as tough as in Taken, but maybe a bit more morose.  Definitely more philosophical.  He proves once more that he is indeed a headliner capable of dominating the screen.  A few others round out the cast well as ""Men, unfit for mankind;"" although, it definitely doesn't fit the normal character for Dermot Mulroney.

As for the plot holes, bizarre decisions made by plane crash survivors, and all the other nitpicking of this film, it's called suspension of disbelief.  Many movies require both an open mouth and an open mind, both for input, neither for output.  Sure, the remaining seven men could have stayed with the plane wreckage for a better chance at rescue, but they've likely seen the results of Alive, and those Uruguayan dudes didn't have to deal with a seemingly endless barrage of brilliant wolves with a taste for the other white meat.

Ultimately, The Grey boils down to mortality.  How the environment, the animals, the general requirements for survival all plot against men at the end of their lives.  Wolves do not reflect; the wind does not cease; the cold does no change temperature.  None of that exists - it's just man's introspection and awareness of no control.  How we react in moments like this allow us to reach that primitive state of survival, and the lengths to which we will go in order to persevere.",1354147200,2,1950,4.828313253012048
4780892,4,B005LAIIS0,"I enjoyed this movie mainly because of the theme, man against nature. I especially enjoyed the last clip (after the credits).
I will not tell you about any of the scenes of the movie & spoil the whole thing by telling every little detail.

I thought the cast were well scripted and performed well with each other.
There was good character development, along with a little backstory which played well in general.

For being a survivalist story, I consider The Grey to be above grade for the par.
The circumstances under which the characters come together & the consequential outcome of those events made for a gripping experience.

The only thing I did not like about The Grey, was the unbelievable, and unrealistic aspect of timberwolves hunting for sport in an extremely hostile and barren wilderness. I just couldn't make myself believe that a hungry pack of wolves wouldn't eat what they kill. It would have gotten a 5-star rating from me if not for that one detail.

From the beginning moments to the closing scene, the entire movie is about death. And while there's nothing wrong with movies that deal with this important topic, this film was devoid of all deeper meaning or greater perspective. It fell from gray to a depressing shade of black. Then, as if it hadn't already overdosed on it's loathing of life, it felt the need to inject lethal doses of human depravity, over-the-top violence, unrealistic fight-against-nature sequences, and a script that could have been written by troubled middle schoolers (trying to outdo each other with how many f-bombs they can squeeze into each phrase).

Philosophical depth? No. Just a look at fatalism from a cold, shallow perspective.

4780978,1,B005LAIIS0,The movie was ruined by the constant and I mean constant use of the F word.  It was in just about every sentence!,1353888000,,113,3.9130434782608696
4780979,2,B005LAIIS0,"I like Liam Neeson as an actor, Les Misrables (1998) is a favorite of mine, and so this winter I checked out The Grey at the local library. I thought the acting and cinematography was excellent. Unfortunately, the language was so bad that I had to practically mute the sound and opted for the closed captions instead (I have young children). Unlike The Chronicles of Narnia, this is not what I would call ""family friendly"" entertainment. It was suspenseful enough to keep my interest (despite the various inconsistencies and inaccuracies that other reviewers have noted), so I stayed on, right up to the dismal ending. It is a rather haunting movie, the kind that stays in your head for a while, so I thought a lot about the underlying philosophy. In the end, the film is more about man's existential predicament and the hiddeness of God, than it is about survival.

***SPOILER ALERT*** After the long painstaking fight for survival, watching each one of his comrades die, one by one, from the wreck, related injuries, wolf attacks, the weather, falling out of a tree, exhaustion, despair, suicide, drowning, being without food, water, shelter, survival gear, rest and subject to the elements of nature, ""the unlikely hero Ottway"" lays on the ground, looking into the sky in desperation and cries out to God, ""Do something. Do something!"" After no response, he trails off in the bitter reality of being utterly alone to contend with the forces of nature, stating, ""I'll do it myself."" We then see him kneeling in the snow going through the pictures in the wallets of the men who are dead. He looks at their families and then considers his own wife. With his wife being deceased, he only has her memory to give him any semblance of meaning, everything else is gone, including his hope of survival. At this point the wolf pack is upon him and the future is already played out. He remembers his father's poem and knows he must make his own choice and that with courage. Allowing fear to paralyze him is not an option. Meanwhile, he has no real reason to live, except for the sake of survival itself, no matter, he will make his choice and stand his ground, however futile it may be. He will not allow his circumstances to dictate his actions, he will not lay down and give up. This is our hero! At least according to the back of the box. ***END OF SPOILER***

I think it is the meaninglessness and futility of it all that the one star reviewers found so disturbing about the film. It is more than having wasted two hours, it is becoming emotionally interested in the characters only to have all possible hope of survival dashed to pieces, but then the film goes on to take it another step further, in which it attempts to capture the finality of death and thus the essential meaninglessness of life. Francis Shaeffer has talked a lot about this despair. In The God Who is There, he explains how many atheists have tried to live as if there is no meaning in life, but their attempts have been utterly futile. Meanwhile, some antagonists accuse Christians of using a crutch, but it is just a simple fact that none of us can live under the psychological stress that atheism places man under, that is to say, it is impossible to live as though there is no meaning.

There is an interesting existential wilderness story that Alvin Plantinga relates in his Spiritual Autobiography that relates to our hero's search for God. ""There has been only one other occasion on which I felt the presence of God with as much immediacy and strength. That was when I once foolishly went hiking alone off-trail in really rugged country south of Mt. Shuksan in the North Cascades, getting lost when rain, snow and fog obscured all the peaks and landmarks. That night, while shivering under a stunted tree in a cold mixture of snow and rain, I felt as close to God as I ever have, before or since. I wasn't clear as to his intentions for me, and I wasn't sure I approved of what I thought his intentions might be (the statistics on people lost alone in that area were not at all encouraging), but I felt very close to him; his presence was enormously palpable. On many other occasions I have felt the presence of God, sometimes very powerfully: in the mountains (the overwhelming grandeur of the night sky from a slope at 13,000 feet), at prayer, in church, when reading the Bible, listening to music, seeing the beauty of the sunshine on the leaves of a tree or on a blade of grass, being in the woods on a snowy night, and on other kinds of occasions.""

I find this to be a most interesting contrast of characters. You have renown Christian philosopher, Alvin Plantinga, who takes great comfort in knowing God's presence, especially when forced to face nature's fury, and then there is the angry existentialist who chooses to completely isolate himself as he contends with his certain dismal fate.",1353888000,,4873,4.636574074074074

4781053,2,B005LAIIS0,"I have to give this film 2 stars because the characters don't act in a realistic manner.  Simply put, this movie follows a group of complete idiots through the woods while they are chased down by wolves.

A question - if you were stranded in the wilderness and being hunted by wolves, what would you do?  Think about this for a few seconds... If you and a handful of other people were stranded as a group and threatened by wolves, what is one of the first things you would do?

MAKE SOME WEAPONS!

That's what you would do.... Well, at least it is what I would do.  And somehow, the characters in this film fail completely in doing that.

I'll give them credit for trying it once.  They stick some shotgun shells on the ends of pointed sticks and then jab a wolf with them.  That works once.  Then... I suppose... they just give up on making any weapons whatsoever.

Dude!  You have at least one knife!  Sharpen some sticks and make some spears!  You are in the woods surrounded by trees.  Can no one find a stick?  You can come up with a way to ignite a shotgun shell with a stick, but you can't figure out a way to actually sharpen a stick?

Heck, just be lazy about it, grab a big stick, and use it like a club.  I don't care what you do, but do something.

So when the group leaves the site of the plan crash, what do they bring along for weapons?  Nothing.  When they are wandering the woods, what do they do for weapons?  Nothing.  As the group's numbers dwindle and there are even less to defend themselves, what do they do for weapons?  Nothing.

Rather than making any attempt to defend themselves, the solution is always ""Ahhhhh!!!  Wolves!!!!  Run!!!""  Then they run around until someone gets eaten.  Brilliant.  Oh yeah, and there always just happens to be one person lagging behind the group.  Gee... I wonder what is going to happen to him???  Hmmmm...

Back to the weapons issue.  For Christ's sake - they came out of a plane crash site.  There is bound to be sharp scraps of metal all over the place.  Grab some of it and tie it to a stick.  Nope... too complicated I guess.  Instead, they run around gathering dead people's wallets.  What?  No time to grab a lead pipe or something?  The Neanderthals figured out how to tie a sharp stone to the end of a stick, but modern man can't find a single thing to make a weapon out of at a plan crash site?

Speaking of the crash site... one of the main reasons they leave the crash site is to escape the wolves.  Where do they go?  Into the woods.  Yes, into the woods.  Is anyone actually shocked that (surprise!) they find that there are actually wolves in the woods?  It's like trying to avoid sharks by jumping into the water.  Ahhhh!!! Sharks what shall we do?  Hurry everyone, grab some supplies and get into the water!

That is so stupid I wanted to cry, but I was too busy vomiting between the couch cushions.

Oh - and on the way from the crash site to the woods, one guy falls behind and is attacked.  The wind is raging, snow is blowing, and everyone is panicked.  The wolves mangle him and leave him for dead.  Then, when the rest of the group approaches the body, suddenly there is no wind... no snow... nothing.  Wow... the crazy blizzard just stopped by some miracle!  Go back and watch and tell me that is not stupid.  That is some bad film editing.",1353024000,5,3324,4.305194805194805

4781191,1,B005LAIIS0,"Unless you want to create a world where genetically altered wolves are attacking and killing humans, then this film might get two stars from me. I'd give it zero stars for the absurd premise and insane idea that wolves hunt and kill humans.

Note to director dude: You should at least research basic animal behavior before creating such a travesty about wolves. Inaccurate, untruthful fantasy. DIf you want to create fantasy then give the wolves some kind of super power, some genetically altered disease. It would then be somewhat believable.

For suspension of disbelief, needed for any film, this one doesn't have it. There is only one good scene in this movie and that is when the first character dies with the guidance of Liam Neeson.

This hungry pack of wolves in the Arctic are fat and plump and kill humans at their whim. In fact for some strange reason, this pack has the leisure time in the depth of winter to forgo their own survival need of searching for food, carrying for their young to marshal hundreds of wolves, it seems, to track, terrorize and kill the humans.

As improbably as that is, there is more. These wolves are the fattest, plumpest wolves on earth, meaty as if they dinned at Claim Jumper take out for lunch and dinner each day.

As fat as these improbably wolves are, there's more. They are bent on killing human, going out of their way to do it.

But, the fact is, there isn't a single confirmed death by a wolf or wolf pack ever. By rabis, yes, but never by a pack of wolves, and never in the manner depicted in this move. At most wolves might get assertive when cornered or when defending a kill. But hunting down and killing 7 humans. Uhhhh. NOOO.

Wikipedia: A wolf attack is an attack on a human by a wolf or wolves. Wild wolves are generally timid around humans. Wolves usually try to avoid contact with people, to the point of even abandoning their kills when an approaching human is detected, but there are several reported circumstances in which wolves have been recorded to act aggressively toward humans.

Compared to other carnivorous mammals known to attack humans in general, the frequency with which wolves have been recorded to kill or prey on people is much lower, indicating that though potentially dangerous, wolves are among the least threatening for their size and predatory potential.[1]

Anyhow, this is just an okay movie. Entertaining enough, but full of kind of dumb things that keep one from truly enjoying the movie.
For instance the fake look of the wolves was REALLY distracting.
Also, the behavior of the wolves wasn't really true to life. And a pack of wolves is generally about 10 wolves - 15 is a pretty big pack. There is a scene where it is dark and you can only hear the wolves, it sounded like there were 50 wolves out there. That just doesn't happen.

Character development was also just so-so. The Liam Neeson character is the only one that is at all developed. Isn't it kind of film making 101 to make sure that the viewers care about the central characters? Who cares if anyone dies if you don't feel anything for them?

4781301,5,B005LAIIS0,"""The Grey"" follows a group of oil company workers at a pumping station in North Alaska, described by Ottway (Liam Neeson) as hell, occupied by ""men unfit for mankind.""  These men seem to be looking for a job with good pay, no matter what the risks.  In the beginning of the film you see the men sleeping and drinking in their free time, oblivious to the outside world.

A small group of men including Ottway, board a small airplane on leave from work.  During their turbulent flight, the plane manages to crash and leave the small ragtag group of individuals in who knows where.  Most of the men are killed quickly during the crash or die soon afterwards, but seven members of the group stay alive.  They have hope that they will be discovered, however, with the snow rapidly covering their crash sight, their hope quickly turns into desperation.  When one of the seven men decides to take a leak, ravenous wolves quickly pounce on him.  This becomes the setup for the rest of the film.  The thought that they not only have to deal with the elements, but also feral wolves, has to be demoralizing.

The frantic journey these men endure is brought to life by terrific acting, mostly because of Liam Neeson, but the rest of the actors due well with bringing their roles to life.  What I enjoyed the most out of the whole film was the director's (Joe Carnahan) dedication to focusing on the individual, not just the overall group.  Each man felt like he had something to live for.  Although none of the characters are as developed as Ottway, you get a sense that these men had lives outside of Alaska.

The ending may be seen as underdeveloped in many eyes, but I honestly liked the open ending.  It left you with room to wonder.

  This movie is a perfect example of why I never leave until the last credit has rolled.  I always hope for an extra tidbit at the very end.  This movie's ""tidbit"" was very important to the final feeling that I came away with.
  The film as a whole was good.  It pissed me off a few times because of misrepresentations of the behavior of wolves, but, hey, it's a fictional movie...so...
  Liam was brilliant, as always, and the acting of most of the others was also very well done.  Character development was shallow, but I don't think that was the point of the movie.  We knew enough as the movie went along with some extra revelations when Liam was ""dealing"" with the wallets towards the end.
  While reading some of the other reviews, I got the impression that most people either left the room or turned off the movie before the end of the credits.  Big mistake.",1351468800,,908,4.49079754601227

A very good movie, I thought, polemic ending or not.

The movie is really depressing, you really feel the weight and unoforgiveness of that environment (wolves present or not).

Acting is very good, and character development is good. What people want? That in series of highly dangerous events that occurs in the period ot two days maximum every character would be perfectly defined?

I got sad with the death of each single character, something very unusual in recent movies.

As for the supposed environmental flaws in the movie, can't talk about them (except for the scene where Ottawy falls into the freezing water and does not tries do dry himself. That was absurd. But, maybe, the final fight with the wolf came shortly after. Would that be time enough for him to freeze to death? I don't know).

Maybe people who are rating this so low are confusing things. Maybe they are giving it one or two stars not because it's bad, but because it is indeed depressing.",1351296000,3,981,4.741176470588235
4781406,5,B005LAIIS0,"The Grey is a gripping tale that on the surface level is about doing whatever it takes to survive. On a deeper level, it asks the question, ""What does it mean to choose to survive vs. deciding to throw in the towel?"" What motivates that decision, and is choosing one way better than the other? The answer that unfolds during the course of the movie seems to be that for every person the answer is different. The movie rises way above the simple, cliched message that our purpose is to persevere and survive no matter what the odds. It makes the case that while in any given situation one person may continue to fight with resources they didn't even know they had, another person may decide that they've had enough, and their reasons for deciding that may be very good ones that they need not feel ashamed about. In any given moment, every person has to make his or her own decision about whether it's worth it to carry on. The Grey explores the issue of survival for mere survival's sake, and prompts us to ask ourselves if that's really what life is all about.
 When I watched this movie on Netflix, I was surprised to see that it had been rated at only three out of five stars. The film definitely deserves at least a four out of five--I personally rated it a five. I think I understand what turned some people off about the movie. Towards the movie's end, it has the opportunity to take a  very cliched, harmless and simple way out, but it does not do this, which I was very happy to see. I have no doubt that many people who saw this film (many with religious leanings) wanted to see the cliche fulfilled, and I'm glad that they were disappointed. It's not right to rate a movie low simply because your personal biases and beliefs were not validated by the film.
 This film can be highly recommended based on the cast performances alone. And no, it's not a movie about some kind of Super Wolf. I highly recommend it, and leave you with this: make sure you sit through the credits.",1351123200,3,1984,4.400544959128065

4781408,5,B005LAIIS0,"It seems that many reviewers seem to need a happy ending, clear answer or their faith in God reinforced by what's presented to them by various producers and directors.
  I view many films, have read thousands of books and still find the approach of a clean wrap up or happy ending to often minimize an entire story.
  For many of us, life is a generic merry-go-round with few hazards to keep us up to speed with the idea that life, for all people, was once very brute-ish and, in fact, still is in some parts of the world.  One reviewer even discounts the film due to characters attempts to invoke God to assist them somehow but no miracles are on hand to provide for their rescue.
  This film took us on a bitter journey in which Liam Neeson's character travels a Homerian path where, in the end, though we do not see it and it's almost certain he didn't survive, he embraces the life he wanted to end so tragically uselessly in the beginning of the film and enters into a final, great battle that, to me, celebrates life and the refusal to go quietly into that dark night - to paraphrase a poem.
  The dramatic set ups - the wolves invading the crash site, Neeson's leadership taking his group in an unfortunate direction - are all part of  what film makers do to create their visions. If wrong choices weren't made or plot moments with holes in them were all left on cutting room floors, we'd all be sitting around playing poker all night instead of watching good, bad and ugly films. I don't make enough to play poker every night and I like getting my nose out of books once in awhile.
  Maybe it's not a 5 star film, but it entertained the crap out of me and, therefore, I gave it as much.

The story builds to a sort of lone wolf metaphor at the end, but it takes place in a world dominated by real wolves; blood-thirty beasts who hunt and kill mercilessly a small group of testosterone-filled oil drillers stranded in the middle of a cold and snowy nowhere after a plane crash. It's a tale of survival, albeit a familiar one, held together not by precious dialogue or clever plotting; the men just trod along; but by a mesmerizing sense of impending doom created by the technical know-how of director Joe Carnahan. He fails in his characterization of the wolves; they seem unrealistically menacing with their sudden horror-movie-like attacks; and directors need to learn that movies like this don't need family flashbacks; we can assume that people who are stranded in the woods and probably going to die soon miss their former lives; but he does well with the people, namely Liam Neeson as leader John Ottway.

4781467,4,B005LAIIS0,"Liam Neeson has quickly become an even bigger star than he already was thanks to the first Taken movie. Since then, he's appeared in more action movies, with the big one after Taken being The Grey. I was excited to see it, as the trailers showed just enough to get you interested, and it looked like he was going to be fighting wolves instead of European traffickers.

However, the trailer is probably the reason this movie's getting so many mixed reviews.

Neeson plays Ottoway, a marksman who was hired to kill wolves in Alaska. He's haunted by flashbacks of his wife, and sets out to kill himself after taking out a wolf. He's unable to do so, and heads back for his plane to go home with the oil workers. It's a stormy night though and the plane has a lot of turbulence, making for a bumpy flight. The bumpy flight soon turns into a nightmare- the plane is ripped apart in mid-flight and crashes. Ottoway wakes up and sees complete destruction (to say the least), finding only a small handful of survivors. The men set up camp at the crash site for the night, only to be disturbed by wolves. These wolves aren't just passing by though...they want the men dead. Even a little provoking by one of the men proves to be a big mistake as the wolves respond, showing just how outnumbered the men are. In the middle of nowhere, without any real supplies and weapons, and with a bad egg or two in the group, how are they going to make it out of this alive?

There's so much that could've been standard with The Grey, but I was amazed at how quickly things moved along and how it kept my interest from beginning to end. Ottoway is a great character, not being the perfect leader. How often do we get stories like this, where the group is led by someone with no flaws? Ottoway admits that he's scared right off the bat, and that there's no shame in it. Why bother trying to show how manly you are in a situation like this? He might come off as cool and relaxed, but the guy shares a couple of laughs with the others at appropriate times. It's good to see that. The other survivors are all given a good amount of time for the most part, and whenever one of them was threatened, no matter how they may have been acting just seconds before, I cared. One man tells a story about his daughter and her long hair, how she'll swing it around in his face to get him up. We find out that another had a sister that passed away when he was a kid, and he still hurts from it. There's a lot I want to say about these characters but doing so would ruin a bit of the movie.

The cast is good, and The Grey has a lot more than just that going for it. The Alaskan scenery is absolutely beautiful. A lot of the locations reminded me of the snowy winters of Oregon I saw when I was younger. There's a scene that takes place by a stream, and you can tell that the director let it play out long enough for you to enjoy the beauty. And how about the plane crash at the beginning? Good lord, I haven't seen anything that intense in a long time. The last big plane crash scene I saw was probably in the first Final Destination, and the one here easily beats it. Before it was even halfway over, I didn't ever want to step foot on a plane again, blizzard or not. One more thing I'll mention is the 'philosophical' nature of the movie. A lot of people have complained about this, and I don't understand why. It's not overdone, not preachy, and it was cool getting something like that in an action-thriller movie. The only thing slightly overdone is the poem that Ottoway reads a couple of times. It's a great poem the first and last time we hear it, and I wish it was only these two times that we heard it.

What keeps The Grey from getting a full 5 stars in my book is the wolf attack scenes...and I can't really fault them for how they did it. Wolf attack sequences are usually done at night with a lot of camera movement to add suspense. The first time the wolves attacked, I was on the edge of my seat, and also unsure of what exactly was going on because it seemed like I was staring at a black screen for a few seconds at one point. In fact, I'm pretty sure I was. I feel things could've been a little cleaner with this part. I'm just glad they didn't take the cheap way out and give us CG wolves. How embarrassing would it be to see men facing the elements, and then a CG wolf pops out? The other small complaint I have is just a pattern I noticed about the movie. It made me laugh when I realized that the movie's pattern is: walk, set up camp, get attacked, walk, set up camp, get attacked. Of course they do a little more here and there. It's just something I noticed.

Those little nitpicks aside, I didn't have any problems with the ending. With how much the poem is drilled into your head, I thought it was pretty obvious what happened, especially when you see the quick scene after the credits. I guess if people are complaining about a movie being 'too philosophical', then it shouldn't surprise me that the ending needs to be spoon-fed to them. If you haven't seen The Grey yet, you're missing out.",1350172800,2,5081,4.243801652892562
4781468,2,B005LAIIS0,"If you are a fan of Liam Neeson, then you will probably watch this movie.  However, I suspect that most will find this movie uninteresting from a plot perspective.  The plot is unrelentingly depressing.  Men working in a remote frozen wasteland only do two things - work and drink.  Flying home, their plane crashes in an area where there are lots and lots of large, aggressive wolves, who one-by-one, pick off the survivors from the plane crash.  Part of the issue with the plot is that the survivors of the plane crash always seem to have the worst luck.  Another unrealistic aspect is that the wolves are very big and fearless but what exactly where the wolves getting fat eating before the plane crash?  Also, the wolves seem to follow them everywhere - the men at one point make it down a shear cliff and low and behold the wolves are there as well.

This movie could have been so much better if they had just toned down the huge amount of bad luck the men encounter, and the wolves were more realistic (check out the movie Never Cry Wolf for a more realistic perspective on wolves).",1350086400,,1088,4.4873096446700504

4781470,1,B005LAIIS0,"The philosophical/psychological themes of this movie, if fleshed out more, could have made it very interesting to me... had not it been so painfully stupid in so many ways. First and foremost, I'm sure I will not be alone in pointing out that real wolves do not look like gigantic evil drooling versions of toy stuffed animals moved jerkily by the hands of a 3-year-old kid. Good gosh, I read it cost $25,000,000 to make this movie... where did the money go? The behavior of the humans was inexplicably dumb as well: Surrounded and chased by a probing pack of satanic wolf puppets, nobody even bothers to carry a club or sharpened stick with them. Injured men are left to lag behind without aid, concern, or watchfulness. Holy cow, even the laws of physics were broken left and right, as campfires composed of tiny sticks burn endlessly without refueling, a man dashing off a snow-covered cliff travels 50 yards horizontally while only dropping 10 feet vertically, and a guy who must be exhausted and starving to begin with shows no apparent signs of hypothermia after emerging into frigid air from a lengthy plunge into ice water. Oh, then there was the thundersnowstorm, something I have never ever witnessed in my entire life of living in the snow country of Upper Michigan. Too many people here are making excuses for this rubbish.

4781471,4,B005LAIIS0,"I almost didn't watch `The Grey'.  It didn't get the warmest of critical receptions, and honestly, it didn't look all that intriguing to me.  A bunch of men being hunted by wolves in the wilderness; I mean, it had promise but it also had potential to be really dumb.  I remember when it was released this past January and my friends went and saw it and pretty much destroyed it.  They loathed this.  One of my friends told me the only reason to see this movie was to see Liam Neeson punch a wolf.  So, I passed.  I didn't see the need to waste my time.  Yesterday, I was bored and saw that this was on Instant Watch with Netflix, so I decided to give it a whirl.  I had been prepped for disappointment, so I was utterly prepared to regret this decision.

You'd think that I'd have learnt by now to never trust my friends when it comes to movies.

`The Grey' is a tightly woven adventure film that pits a group of oil workers against harsh weather and even harsher animals as they survive a tragic plane crash.  Upon doing so, they are immediately at odds with one another, but one man steps forward to lead this group to safety.  Ottway, an emotionally conflicted hunter dealing with darkness in his soul and suicidal thoughts, takes the reigns when it becomes apparent that the group is being hunted by a pack of ravenous wolves.  Despite the blistering cold and the countless obstacles in their path, the group grows stronger (as their numbers dwindle) and Ottway's determination to survive overtakes him.

As a film, `The Grey' is very good.  It is sharply edited to keep us glued, and it is beautifully shot.  But, above all else, there is one really big reason to watch this film; Liam Neeson.

I'm labeling Neeson an Oscar snub months before the nominees are announced because even I know that there is no way he's being nominated this year.  `The Grey' was a January release and is all but forgotten by now.  With the countless films being released in the next few months with strong actors in baity roles, Neeson has about a 2% chance of even getting a mention by a critic as an Oscar hopeful.  He has an even less percent chance at an actual nomination.  Still, I moved to highlight this performance because it is everything that an Oscar nomination deserves to be.  Neeson is an actor who has truly come into a new era of celebrity as he's stepped into the role of action hero.  With `Taken' he proved that age is nothing when you have a voice of steel and the presence of a soldier.  With `The Grey', Neeson shows us that he can balance out the strength of a leader with the vulnerability of a man.

I'm going to just go ahead and say it; this performance reminds me quite a bit of Russell Crowe's Oscar winning performance in `Gladiator'.  That is the sad fact for Neeson, for if `The Grey' had been perceived as a better film (why in the world was this dismissed?) and if it had been released later in the year then I could easily see Neeson, a respected and talented previous Oscar nominee, very much in the conversation of Oscar.  Instead, he's going to be shafted.

Neeson's very first scene, which consists of mere voice over and a suicide attempt, sets the stage for his character's complete full circle, and that is one of those things that really moves me towards loving this performance.  We watch him go from this man who has practically lost everything to this man who is determined to live for something.  Watching him stir up the men under his wing so-to-speak, or watching him stare down the beast with a lustful sense of survival, stirs in us such emotional connection to this `every man'.  Neeson perfects that vision of a relatable man we can all rally behind, we can all invest in because he reminds us of ourselves.  Peering into his eyes we see his very soul staring back at us.  You never once see the actor but you always see the man.  The weight of his past and his sadness crushing down on him, Neeson builds a complete portrait of this man with searing realism.

And that moment, where he talks a man through his own death is phenomenally played.

At the end of the day, Neeson turns in one of his finest acting moments yet in a film that is exciting, compelling and emotionally resonant.  It is a strong film that deserves a wider audience.",1349827200,,4278,4.451156812339332

Just wasted 2 hours of my life. What was advertised as ""suspenseful"" was actually boring - with a triple O. A lot of problems with this movie. Characters were not flashed out or in any way sympathetic, so it was hard to feel for them, their predicament and/or death. The ""wolves"" looked really phony in the few real views the movie allowed, mostly just growling noises and a lot of yelling and shaky camera movements - ending up with a mauled person. Horrible language - every 2nd word is a 4 letter word of every variety possible. The end was one of these ""no ends"", however, it is not a long shot to imagine that the wolves won.
PLEASE don't waste your time, this is pure trash. Won't even go into the inaccuracies or improbabilities - the other viewer already covered them in detail.
Liam - PLEASE think twice before accepting such a ridiculous script!!!",1348704000,3,1014,4.427807486631016

4781770,2,B005LAIIS0,"It's been said before in a lot of one-star reviews but the characters did literally almost everything wrong from the moment the plane crashes. I'm no outdoor survivalist by any means but I think even my 80 year old aunt would have the sense not to leave the plane, a source of warmth, shelter, and not to mention a beacon to any rescuers.

Imagine if you were on a cruise ship that had a power outage. Would you leap into the ocean and start swimming in shark infested water, hoping to find an island somewhere? That's sort of what these characters did.

The reasons for leaving the crashed plane and heading out into a wide open area for a swath of trees off in the distance are even more dumbfounding. Liam Neeson's character keeps insisting ""We've got to get food."" despite the fact, that, if they would just hunker down and not expel a lot of energy dashing across the tundra, starvation wouldn't even be a concern for another couple weeks.

It was bad, really, really bad, and takes itself far too seriously. It's getting two stars instead of one just because I was still talking about how dumb it was even a week later, so at least it wasn't forgetably dumb, it was epically dumb.

I know there are those who gave it 5 stars and raved about it. Hey, I'm glad you were able to take away something from it I wasn't.",1348272000,,1319,4.39344262295082

4781773,4,B005LAIIS0,"If there is such a thing as a 'death-affirming' film, The Grey is just that, a film which faces death head on in grizzled, human fashion and invites the viewer to gaze unblinking as well. This isn't a sugar-coated survival story where men built giant implements from jungle grass and spears or end up staring up at a heavenly deus ex machina helicopter that happens to be surging over the Alaskan tundra. No, The Grey is a dour, sometimes even depressing, film, where survival is questionable, but the battle must still be fought.
Liam Neeson--in a far less super-human role than he plays in, say, Taken--leads a few ragged oil men through a remote part of Alaska following a plane crash. The men are starving, freezing, and very, very afraid. The characters are a bit familiar, there is the hot-head renegade, for example, who spars with Neeson over leadership roles and attempts to purloin dead mens' wallets. The archetypes like this man lend a striking humanity to the survivors--these are flawed people in an unfamiliar and hostile world. We are trapped with them whether we like it or not. But they are not alone in all that ice and whipping wind. Haunting predators are loose in the snow, showing up without warning like horror movie creatures. Blood flows and bodies are mauled. The men try to continue to live in spite of this. They must work together to face the seemingly impossible probability that they will perish. Neeson, at times, is a Shepard of sorts, offering a dying man comforting words early on as he bleeds out. The man looks around, wild-eyed, terrified, repeating, ""Something's wrong. Something's wrong. I'm too warm. I don't know what's happening."" ""You're dying,"" Neeson calmly assures him, ""and it is going to be over soon. Tell me who you love. And let that person guide you there."" Sound heavy? It sure as hell is. This is not a popcorn thrill-ride like the trailers made it out to be--though there are indeed breathtaking action sequences (the plane crash is one of the best on record, for example). This is a tough, sometimes hard-to-watch, though ultimately beautiful and poignant human endurance tale. There is a sanctity in death explored here that lesser films of this genre (The Edge, for example) were quite a bit too timid (or worried over box office potential) to explore. The Grey explores the power of death and the will to face it knowingly.",1348185600,,2384,4.802919708029197

Along the way, the elements and terrain, along with a nasty band of attacking wolves, complicate things in a predictable way. For instance, when one of the men started to cough constantly, all I thought in my head was, he's dead. You'll find yourself saying the same thing throughout. You basically start to watch it just to find out who dies next. The suspense was just lacking and the story didn't really end. I guess we're supposed to fill our minds with how that fight goes?

Should have had four stars for not quite the character development (another survival story--but no William Bendix anywhere) everybody thinks it had, and somewhat plotless action (but what could you do?)--very tough, a first for a godless Ben-Hur where it ends with the race and callous revelation. Tough-minded, and with several interesting twists (the jerk who doesn't stay a jerk OR become a hero, the role of a Bergman-like Death around everyone--his woman who dies (predictable) but tells him not to be afraid, killing the wolf at the beginning, wolves get him in the end, almost killing himself, guiding the fallen passenger to his death, etc.). In short, not one of the great ones, but a genuine adult film that doesn't pander to American cavalry-or-God endings, well worth watching. By the way, it doesn't say there isn't a God, just that He doesn't work the way we expect Him/Her/It to, i.e. it is not an atheist film per se.

4781863,4,B005LAIIS0,"The Grey follows an oil drilling team as they try to survive after their plane crashes during a blizzard; not only do they have to survive the harsh weather conditions, they must also survive attacks from a pack of gray wolves. The Grey has a simple story but also goes deeper into the characters; for example, John Ottway (Liam Neeson) often questions life and has lost faith, and some of the audience may be appreciate the attempt to create deep characters. The movie has plenty of thrills, including many chase scenes with packs of wolves. Some of the thrills also come from the environment and the survival. Also, I thought the music was amazing and the film was shot beautifully; the acting was also great. It does get a bit repetitive, though, which may be because of the 1hr 50min runtime; it doesn't have as much variety as it could've had and does feel like it drags on.

Overall, I highly recommend The Grey. As of 9/15/12, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, if you'd like to save some money.

4782062,4,B005LAIIS0,"`The Grey' isn't usually my kind of movie, but after hearing nothing but good things about it, I gave it a watch and I wasn't disappointed. It's actually quite a suspenseful survival-thriller and I loved it from the first minute to when the credits started rolling.

Liam Neeson is John Ottway, a hunter working on an Alaskan drilling station who keeps the wolves away with his trusty rifle. On his flight home, his plane crashes in the middle of nowhere with just him and a handful of survivors, as they try and make their way to people, they find themselves under siege by wolves while battling it out with the cold weather and injuries.

Director Joe Carnahan knows how to keep things edgy, he uses the thick darkness of night and the low visibility of the blizzard to great effect; in one scene, the wolves let out a terrifying howl in response to Ottway's challenge and all we can see are their cold breaths and we never know when one, or several, are going to jump out and maul one of the survivor's to death. And it helps that they also give the wolves an almost eerily human quality; they take revenge for the fallen, they send pack outcasts to test the group, they use tactics...you get the feeling that Ottway and co. aren't just facing a pack of wild, mongrel wolves, they're facing an organized and formidable enemy. The dangers don't just come from the wolves, the weather, the injuries and the dangerous terrain the group traverse only serve to make their situation that much more dire.

But it's not all action and I'm thankful that Carnahan also had the mind to take time out to build the characters, give us insight into their pasts and their relationships with each other and to get you emotionally connected to them, especially John Ottway. It really made their deaths that much more painful to watch in the end, especially further into the movie, where the remaining guys had already been through so much, a few of the deaths might even make you a little misty. Along the way you get a little exploration of death, faith, God and courage to give you a little food for thought, necessary or not, it does give the film some appreciated depth. `The Grey' is worth the watch.",1346716800,2,2191,4.569974554707379

This film represents the arrogant point of view of the U.S. secular film industry as art. The idea that meaningful dialogue always has to include the 'F' word is demeaning itself as a filler for an abject poverty of dialogue.  Only in the 21st century has cursing considered part of literature.  Corse language demeans literature.  Any actor that considers it art is not an artist.  This film also represents the secular Hollywood philosophy.  Life sucks and then you die while cursing God.  I would rather call this movie a ""Wolf's Free Lunch in Alaska"".  Oh by the way if Hollywood wants to take artist license with the difference between day and night in wilderness of Alaska that's okay by me.  In the winter most of the day its dark, in summer most of the day is light. Do not watch this movie if you are seeking the meaning of life.

4782135,1,B005LAIIS0,"Troubled guy at remote Alaskan outpost backs off on suicide attempt to catch a plane out with other workers. The plane crashes, leaving a handful of survivors who conveniently represent and contrast unique personality types (see Seven Dwarfs) to play off the protagonist. Logic would seem to dictate that they fashion the wreckage into some kind of shelter and await a search team tracing the plane's route. But, logic missed the casting call for this flick.

They work on the premise that there's little interest or resources lined up to locate them. Really? I'm guessing a couple hundred stakeholders and their rabid attorneys might provide some motivation for a rescue attempt.

Enter the threat, in the form of a wolf pack. Try to overlook that wolves do not reside in this region and that the breed avoids man (global wolf attack fatalities annually can be counted on one hand, or less). And, get used to overlooking, because you'll need to do a lot of this before this derelict finally slides beneath the waves. And spare me the pseudo-intellectual allegorical dodge. Moby Dick was symbolization, but at least he acted like a whale. And he looked a heck of a lot more like a whale in the 1956 movie than these cartoon wolves resemble canines with 21st century technology.

The first attack is repelled by clubbing the beasts. Why use sharp pieces of metal or the protagonist's rifle when you can flail? By the way, the rifle is discarded because of a broken stock. Apparently, in the wilderness, no weapon is deemed better than one that's superficially damaged in this reality. Theorizing that the wolves are bent upon destroying them (attributing human thought processes to the beasts), the survivors nonetheless set off without fashioning weapons from the wreckage.

Predictably, the wolves commence picking off the cast, one by one. When there are two left, one falls into a frigid stream and is swept downstream by the current. The protagonist does the only thing the cognitive standard of this movie will permit. He leaps into the frigid waters, too.

Miraculously, neither suffers cold shock. But, the first man gets his foot entrapped, holding his head underwater upstream. Come again? That's the equivalent of holding the string of a balloon and it strains upwind. With this contradiction to the laws of physics in effect, it comes as no surprise that the rescuer cannot elevate the victim's head above water. Failing to do so, he remains in the freezing water to contemplate this and allow hypothermia to get a better death grip on him.

But, of course it doesn't. Fifteen minutes of being immersed in this freezing water and/or subsequently exposed to the cold wind would render you incapable of doing anything to fend off your impending doom. But, you're not in this movie.

Having shrugged off the mere discomfort of hypothermia, the protagonist trudges on to the obvious next scene, a confrontation with the wolf pack. Who didn't see this one marching down Main Street? In a tableau reminiscent of ""West Side Story,"" the lesser players back off to set the stage for a mano a Fido throwdown between the respective alpha role players. Cue the dancers. ""When you're a wolf you're a wolf all the way...""

4782138,2,B005LAIIS0,"Man, I knew that this movie was going to be a dour survival actioner but...really?  ""The Grey"" played out somewhat like Ten Little Indians where the characters keep getting knocked off one by one.  There was really very little suspense in this; certain situations were just ripe for the loss of the next would-be survivor, like when the group passes over a gorge on a makeshift rope.  You just knew that the last guy was gonna drop.  The wolves, a major action point for this movie, are always present yet somehow strangely muted.  They're not believable.  They're more like something out of a bad horror movie.  The survivors aren't given any immediate significant backstory and so we aren't asked to care about these guys, and Neeson's John Ottway character is a man who is walking through the shadows of this life; he's already more dead than alive and he knows it.  But the movie still tries to make him the moral center and savior of the desperate crash victims, and so there's supposed to be more weight and gravitas to the things he says like when he recites his father's poem, or when he tells his fellow followers that they are right to care about their loved ones, or when he asserts himself as the alpha wolf of his pack but then tells his litter mate, ""It's okay to be afraid.  You're stupid if you're not afraid""  It all comes across as platitudinal and by movie's end we all feel like we're the stupid ones for being tricked into watching this turkey.  But perhaps the greatest downfall of this movie about existential survival is that it doesn't give us anything really meaty or impressive to chew on, it just gives those big, fake wolves some actors to sink their teeth into.  There could have been something more there if it honestly explored the themes of faith and doubt, as one would expect would be generated by the events that befall these poor people, but the passing points it puts in these character's mouths are really trivial at best.  The ending is a fill-it-in-yourself affair, something which the masses really hate I think.  That didn't bother me so much but it will a lot of people and it will shut the lid for them on this flick.

In closing I'll offer that if you want to see a good movie about existential survival and animals eating humans then check out the underappreciated ""The Ghost and the Darkness"".  It may cause you to think a little, you may jump a little, and by movie's end you won't feel like you've been ripped off.",1346198400,2,2464,4.553287981859411

4782274,3,B005LAIIS0,"I rented ""The Grey"" and was really looking forward to it.  I had heard a lot about it, and only one or two of the people I spoke to said they didn't really like it.  The movie had me intrigued from the opening scenes: a tired, conflicted man somewhere in the arctic hunting wolves and drinking.  My intrigue began to wane however, and eventually deflated to disappointment in a movie that had a lot of potential.  Here's the good and the not so good.

Good:
Interesting story.  Liam Neeson did well portraying a man conflicted and maybe a little broken trying to make up for past mistakes but not quite sure how to do so.  As I said earlier, the opening scenes of the movie draw the viewer in and you begin to wonder where the story will take you.  The stories and different personalities of the other characters on the plane added to the story and character development, and the plane crash had some good tension building aspects.

Bad:
After the plane crash, the movie takes a sharp left turn and goes downhill.  As anyone who's seen the previews knows, this movie is based on survival against nature and wolves.  While one doesn't expect today's action movies to be extremely realistic, the wolves portrayed in this movie were the size of bears.  Again, I know it's a movie and maybe the size of the wolves could be said to be symbolic, but much of the tension and suspense of a movie like this is generated through the audience identifying something in the movie that could be real, something that could actually happen.  Being chased down by wolves the size of grizzlies is not very likely to happen unless you've decided to partake of certain street pharmaceuticals.  My other large complaint and dissatisfaction with the film was that it felt like it couldn't decide what kind of movie it was going to be.  At times the movie felt more like a mindless action movie.  Awesome!  I love action movies.  But then only a scene later the movie becomes poetic and deeply epic.  Which is fine too, but these two elements were never melded together so the movie becomes choppy, going from slaughtering things with no remorse to reciting rhymes and poems the main character's father taught him.  The most frustrating part about the movie was that it had so much potential to be so much more.  If the director had had a more clear vision of what he wanted the movie to be, and stayed with it, it could have been a great movie.  Instead we're left with an attempt at capturing a great classic of conflict: man vs. nature, but with distractions and no clear path the whole way.  The circumstances leading up to the ending of the movie seemed to be haphazardly thrown together, but the actual ending of the movie was well done.  It was a huge reason why I was frustrated with the unrealized potential of the film.  If the director had used the ending, which was just open ended enough to leave you thinking after the movie has been returned, and built everything around that, it would have been great.  Alas I think the days of story being more important than explosions and giant wolves are gone.  Gone are the Hitchcocks.  I was just hoping for more.",1345593600,,3145,4.548042704626335
4782275,5,B005LAIIS0,"First off, this movie was advertised very poorly, borderline falsely. This is not an action movie. Liam Neeson does not fight a pack of wolves barehanded.

What this film is, though, is a compelling, exciting character study. Liam Neeson deserves an Oscar for this film. It's the best performance of his long carreer, and very emotional. His character is seperated from his lover, and knowing his real life wife passed away before he shot this film, it makes it even harder to watch, but incredibly believable.

All of the actors put in excellent performances, and the characters all behave realistically. You can feel the isolation, fear, and horrifying conditions they are all going through as they survive a plane crash only to have to endure the dangerous Alaskan wilds.

Joe Carnahan's direction is alternately beautiful and unsettling. It recalls his early film Narc, and challenges that film as the best of his works so far.

Again, not much happens plot-wise. There is not tons of action. This is a character drama, a survival movie, and the best movie of the year.",1345593600,2,1073,4.911602209944752

4782280,2,B005LAIIS0,"Filmmakers of ""The Grey"" should thank ever-reliable Liam Neeson for joining their project. Without his strong performance ""The Grey"" would have been an unwatchable mess.

Liam Neeson plays John Ottway, a man hired by an oil company in Alaska to ""protect"" the workers from wolves by shooting them. Ottway take a flight with the crew of oil workers, but his plane crashes in the Alaskan wilderness. The premise may reminds us of ""Alive"" (1993), a film based on true events, but ""The Grey,"" directed by Joe Carnahan (""Narc"" ""The A-Team""), it seems, aims for something different - something more mystical.

Thus grey wolves are depicted as very violent creatures with uncanny abilities to spot the humans. I do not disagree with the idea of turning wolves into symbolic presence, but I still don't know whether I should take the film's story seriously or not. While Joe Carnahan's approach to the subject matter of survival tends to emphasize the realism (with the spectacular visual of the freezing snow and wilderness), the story that unfolds here often looks like an action-movie template, with a group of blood-thirsty wolves (special effects included) and cliff jumping.

Some viewers would find the film's abrupt ending (including one post-credit scene) unsatisfactory (is there an alternate ending?) Some may find the film's tone too depressing. But what I didn't like about the film is its lack of credible motives on the humans' side. Why do they have to leave the plane, for instance? Neeson's character explains, but never convinces, as his character, if not his performance, lacks the credible voice of Jack London, who would have given some advice to filmmakers.

4782282,4,B005LAIIS0,"This is a good movie and one of the few dramas I actually like. Yes, it has action to keep the pace up, but the action is secondary. To me this movie is a philosophical outlook on death and how people face it. Each character is forced to face the reality that we all die sometime and they have to decide whether they want to accept it, or try to live. The poem that Neeson's character recites is the main theme of this movie and I like it.

The plane crashes killing most of the people and the survivors are hunted by a pack of wolves until they too die; though it is open to interpretation as to whether Liam Neeson's character dies. And for those of you complaining about the reality of the movie, maybe you forgot the fact that this is a movie. By the way, animals hunting humans isn't too far from the truth. It has happened before, though it is normally a single animal that does it and not a pack. But again, this is a movie.

If you stay through the credits, you learn that the wolf he fights at the end is killed, but it's a real close up shot so you don't know if the character lived; or even makes it off the mountain. As for me, I feel that he character does ultimately die even after fighting the wolf because he lays all the wallets down and the letter. Sort of an acceptance of his end. But at least he went out with a bang.

I recommend at least watching it once. Just be aware that the ending is open to interpretation.",1344816000,,1435,4.117857142857143

What the film chooses to do, it does very well - the suspense is so thick that my neck muscles remained in a stiff vice grip for hours, and the constant landscape shots are awe-inspiring - but those wildly successful qualities come at the expense of others. It's not a story with a firm resolution, which is sure to polarize a lot of viewers, and most of its intentions are left ambiguous. Liam Neeson is his typical commanding, badass self, but despite a few action hero moments he makes some boneheaded mistakes and his leadership qualities leave a lot to be desired. I've read that the plot is a metaphor for existentialism, which makes plenty of sense in reflection, but in the heat of the moment it feels desolate and hopeless. That innate duality makes it a complicated picture to rate; I wasn't oblivious to its faults, but still found it a dense, intriguing and enveloping experience.

4782349,1,B005LAIIS0,"I would rate this movie among the three worst movies I have ever seen - along with ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" and ""The Cook, the Thief, His Wife, Her Lover.""  Although each movie is of a quite different genre, they all have one thing in common: they all see life as a god-forsaken pit of meaningless despair.  If that is a theme that rings your bell, then these movies are for you.  If not, you may want to save your time and money and avoid them.

The story begins with Liam Neeson's character (John Ottway) who is a contract killer of any wolf that happens to wander onto the company property around an oil rig which sits at the end of the world somewhere in arctic Alaska.  We get the impression that wolves may be predators but John Ottway is higher on the food-chain - supposedly.  Nonetheless, Ottway is a severely depressed personality mourning his wife (girlfriend?) who left him.

The night-life at this company town - this hole of depression amidst a sea of isolation - leaves much to be desired.  There is drunkenness and brawling; it is a coarse and vulgar existence.  And things only go downhill from there.

Next, crew members from the oil rig board a plane to escape for some R & R.  The flight, however, seems cursed from the outset as it takes off in a blizzard.  Taking off in a blizzard seems rather unlikely, but it is only one of several implausible twists we shall consider shortly.  Right after taking off, they then encounter severe turbulence which elicits a long stream of profanity laden curses and dialogue.

Nevertheless, the flight does temporarily level off and it seems for a while to go well.  But that escape into momentary slumber is rudely lost as the plane inexplicably freezes up and then pitches uncontrollably towards the earth.  It crashes in a frozen tundra.  That, however, is but the beginning of a struggle for survival by men, most of whom have serious character flaws.  This struggle pits them not only against the elements, but also against a relentless foe of mythical proportions - a pack of wolves led by an alpha-male of almost human cunning and monstrous ferocity.

The movie has many implausible twists in it.  But, be not deceived; this movie is not intended to be taken literally.  It is seemingly intended by the writers and director (and actors ?) to be a parable, a commentary about life and its meaning, or lack thereof.  And it is a grizzly parable at that.

In this parable, the wolves are undoubtedly meant to represent life (or is it death?) in a most cynical way.  Life on the oil rig is itself a cold, dreary ordeal - endless drilling (""boring"") into a dark meaningless abyss, punctuated only by escapes into vulgarity, brawling, drunkenness, and fornication.

The movie, however, makes clear that trying to escape this dreary existence called life is itself an exercise in futility as we are then dropped into the cold realization that life/death, like a ravenous wolf, chases us through a world that is devoid of meaning and of God... or at least if there is a god, he torments us with a sick and cynical sense of humor, abandoning us in the end to the wolves' lair.  Be assured, the wolves do not in the least represent Francis Thompson's ""Hound of Heaven"", maybe His opposite, but not the Hound.

And here is the unmistakable message: life/death in this worldview relentlessly hunts us down, voraciously consumes us, and in the end leaves us as some crapped-out pile of canine excrement.  You see, in the end, even an alpha-predator eventually gets consumed and dumped by the ultimate predator - life/death itself.

I was surprised to see Liam Neeson in such a role and such a movie.  In the past, I have appreciated much of his work which has often contained a testament to the nobility of the human struggle.  This movie offers no such nobility.  Perhaps it reflects his despair at the loss of his wife not that long ago in a skiing accident.  Whatever the case, one hopes for more from him and the roles he plays in the future.

It will be a long time before I watch another movie written or directed by Joe Carnahan.  I will leave him to wallow in his nihilism - which, of course, requires some incredibly implausible twists in logic and in worldview in order to be maintained.

Sounds like a no-brainer with plenty of rewarding suspense and bloody, gory action, right? Well the no-brainer part is accurate. This movie falls way way short of what I suspect all of us who sat through this film were expecting. We all saw the preview they kept showing where Neeson's character, in a strategic and yet desperate attempt to gird himself for war with vicious canines, creates his own special version of a ""knuckle sandwich,"" and we practically turned blue while holding our breath in anticipation of the spectacular and visceral showdown that we knew was to take place. It would be more brutal than Ali vs. Frazier; it would be wilder than King Kong vs. Godzilla. After all, with today's special effects being what they are, what else were we to expect, right?

Well I will not reveal the ending, but I feel it is only fair to let people know that THERE IS NO CLIMACTIC BATTLE.  Not only does this film shamelessly skimp on the goods, but the few attack sequences we do see come off as very jerky with annoying quick edits, the kind that make it impossible to clearly decipher exactly what's going on. Most of the all-male cast are not that interesting. There are a couple of semi-interesting moments of conflict among the men--most notably Liam Neeson and a loudmouth who keeps needling him--but for the most part, I never found myself caring very much about whether these guys lived or died. In fact, I waited for most of them to die as meaningful build-up to the big battle... that we sadly never see.

This film was a big disappointment, especially coming on the heels of Liam Neeson's UNKNOWN. This was an engaging setup that never comes close to expl;oring its full potential. The editor (or editors) in charge of putting together the promo previews for this film need to have their foreheads perforated by staple guns. Sure, they put something together that no doubt drew crowds into the theaters, but I'd bet all five of my left toes that everyone walked out of that screening feeling cheated, demoralized, deflated.

The disjointed beginning of the movie wasn't helped with Neeson's voice over.  I find that movies that do not do a terrific job up front with flashbacks, lose me before the movie is ten minutes in.  The flashback to Neeson's family isn't a binding force.  It is too soon to care for the character's, so it is wasted on the viewer.  Shooting the wolf in the opening scenes also lacks cohesion.

Eventually, the scene shifts to a plane, inane conversation and a crash that is as disjointed as the start of the movie.  And then survival and wolves.

I can't begin to explain how utterly unending and boring the rest of the movie is.  Punctuated with moments of thrill/fear as the wolves threaten the survival of each man in turn..... the monotony rendered this movie forgettable.

The movie doesn't show how exactly the characters feel in that situation, it's just that the wolves keep coming and kill one by one and the characters keep running away from them.

Oh also, they could have just collected the metal derbies of the flight and could have covered up the opening so that the wolves won't have chance to attack them and also they would have been a lot warmer.

This movie is for those who wants to die, where this movie explains you shouldn't die by yourself but you're gonna die eventually anyway.

And use of the F word is countless.

This would have been a much better movie if:

1. They had set this in the 60s or 70s (even the 80s!) to make leaving the site of the plane wreck a semi-viable option. Saying they (the airline/authorities I assume) don't care about them so won't search for the wreck is just the first piece of the big pile of BS in this movie. They left shelter from the wind, a fuel source, and a supply of food (gross, I know, but all too true). Wolves would not have been a concern in the real world.

2. Get rid of the unrealistic wolves. (In this day and age, the fake looking wolves are completely inexcusable!) A brief encounter with a wolf pack might have been believable, but no wolves are going to follow you like that. Or attack like that.(btw, a pack generally consists of a mated pair and offspring.) Read a real scientific book on wolf behavior before spouting nonsense in a movie, Hollywood. Heck, you can wiki more reliable info than they used here. I am also unsure of how the wolves cross the ravine later in the movie. Perhaps they briefly sprouted wings.

3. No one gets in that kind of water at that time of year and makes it out. They would have been dead from the cold. It took all of ten seconds to look up that info. (two minutes in freezing water and you begin to lose the ability to even move)

This could have been an awesome movie about facing death, etc. Instead it was drivel. Even Liam couldn't save this one. One star for the wonderful Liam Neeson, one star for the surprisingly good poem.",1343347200,,1526,4.359154929577465

4782590,3,B005LAIIS0,"Call me a sucker for survival stories but when I first watched the Grey I expected Liam Neeson going out into the woods to punch wolves or something, so the story seemed dumb at first, but after watching it the first time I was blown away, it was entertaining throughout and each of the characters had more depth than I was expecting for this type of movie, it was tense, horrifying, exhilirating, and exciting.

Then I watched it the second time with my girlfriend and she basically ruined it for me, somehow she knew that his wife was dead the whole time, asked how Liam Neeson fell out of the plane when he was buckled to three seats and there was no evidence that the seats themselves fell out, pointed out how the wolves politely waited for the men to have their moments talking with each other before attacking, and how Liam Neeson wasn't shivering violently after coming out of the freezing water. Damn.

So maybe a bunch of dudes out in the wild fighting for survival is just a guy thing, so yeah it was a bit stupid at parts but I still found it very entertaining, and not something I'd expect from the director of Smokin' Aces and Narc. Also considering how many times Liam Neeson recited that poem they'd call this film The Fray?",1343001600,,1240,4.458149779735683
4782591,2,B005LAIIS0,"I really wanted to like this movie. The opening chapters of Jack London's ""White Fang"" are one of my favorite piece of literature, and the ""man versus Wolf"" set up, with the wolves representing wilderness, seemed really promising. However, this movie has just too many holes in it.
The basic premise makes no sense. Here we have a sizable aircraft with dozens of passengers crashing on a known route of flight out on an open plain. There is absolutely no reason for the assumption that they will not be found very soon.
Second, even if they were far off the planned route, leaving the relative protection and resources of the aircraft wreckage in order to be floundering through the snow doesn't seem a very smart choice.
Next, Liam Neeson's character makes a big deal of standing firm and facing down the wolves, but then several times changes the strategy to: ""RUN!!!""
Those are just a few samples. I'll move on to the general weaknesses of the movie.
First, while the acting itself is good, Liam Neeson plays, well, basically Liam Neeson, and none of the other characters give us any particular reason to care about them.
Second, the utter predictability of the storyline. The characters die one by one, and did anybody seriously expect the finale to be anything but a confrontation between Neeson and the alpha wolf? And to add insult to injury, the audience is even cheated out of that.
Finally, the wolves. The production uses some footage of real wolves, but mostly they're a combination of really bad special effects and pretty amateurish CGI. For example, when we first see the whole pack through the reflection of their eyes outside the fire circle, they basically look like a bunch of production assistants holding pairs of LED lights (which is probably what they were) The alpha wolf in the final scene looks more like the black smoke from LOST than a wolf. I mean, the producers of ""The Ghost and the Darkness"" were able to manage fully grown lions in a credible way, and here they can't get the wolves right?
So overall, a movie with a lot of promise was botched.",1343001600,2,2077,4.708791208791209

4782594,1,B005LAIIS0,"This is one of the best acted BAD movies I have ever seen. The problem is with its stupid script and inept direction.

For those who know anything at all about airplanes or wolves or survival skills, YOU are way ahead of the ignorant twit who came up with this film's script.

Time and again there are huge plot holes regarding these three facets of the story of a small group of men attempting to survive in the arctic after their plane has crashed and they are being attacked by a pack of wolves.

Virtually no attempt is made to keep bare hands covered and warm ... and oddly none of the men seems to suffer from the cold to any major extent. Probably the stupidest scene is where two people went into a stream, and when Liam Neeson's character got out in soaking clothes, he wasn't cold at all - he just wore his wet clothes till they dried out from his body heat ... or whatever, never even shivering as he strolled along.

There are only two short ""good"" scenes in the whole film. In one of them, Neeson's character helps a dying man get through his ordeal. In another, a depleted man sits down and makes it clear that he will go no farther, because back in civilization his life is just crap. A few scenes try to be ""philosophical"" about religion and God and faith, but they fall flat, chiefly because they are too one-sided towards atheism.

The ending leaves one rooting for the wolves, who seem to have the mindset of the worse apes in PLANET OF THE APES. Why? Because the men are basically a disease in their territory, and perhaps in every territory, and are best eradicated.",1342828800,7,1587,4.384353741496598

These type of movies where something like this could happen and may have happen to some unfortunate souls somewhere had always intriqued me, but now I find them so gruesome and depressing that I will probably not see this movie again.

As one reviewer has written it's more of a psychological thriller than a survival story because..well,...you will just have to see the movie.  Liam's face on the cover should give you a clue.

The gift for me is probably the complaint of others.  That is, the Greys seem mechanical and fake, which is what I kept telling myself during cringe worthy moments.  The storyline is more about the human condition and our relationship with the darkness that is life as well as the ability to make choices that persist against obstacles and all odds or total surrender to the destiny that knocks.  Only the strong survives comes to mind, but strength can be measured in many ways.

For me at this point in time in my own survival journey where the conditions aren't so bleak, however, various types of wolves in everyday living is always preying in someway on ones vulnerabilities or waiting for a weak moment in an individual or perhaps even the one trying to keep up with the rest.

The film maker obviously detests the oil industry and those who work in the industry.  As a result, the oilmen are all a bunch of losers.  When the plane crashes, do the survivor's stay with the plane where people will be searching for them?  No, of course not.  The EVIL oil company won't spend money looking for them, so let's walk across Alaska in mid-winter instead.  Yeah, right.......

4782739,4,B005LAIIS0,"A man with nothing left to live for, all that he loves, including his faith, gone. This is what our central character faces as our movie begins. This is about what makes life worth living, and what you would fight for if death was on your doorstep and had you all but ready to surrender to it.

An oil drilling company is the location where a bunch of forgotten men, the dregs of society, take a job no one wants in an unforgiving environment. On the way to Anchorage, the plane crashes and a handful of survivors are stranded far from civilization facing the elements, starvation and a pack of relentless wolves. The story centers around Liam Neeson, who we learn was a man hired to kill wolves threatening the drillers. As the survivors collect their bearings, it is he who takes control of this group and lends his knowledge of wolves. From here, it is a fight for survival as the group struggles to get to safety and are stalked by the wolves.

This movie had great acting, and while it has action, it is not really an action film. It has similarities to other films such as The Edge, and Alive. If you enjoyed those movies you will enjoy this. I chalk up the bad reviews this movie got to people not liking the ending, and/or the lack of action. I personally recommend it highly.",1342569600,2,1284,4.413502109704641

So what if the wolves aren't ""realistic"" enough. That isn't the point. The film succeeds far beyond the ""realness"" of the wolves or their behavior. It isn't about wolves. Sorry to break it to you but you missed the point of the film entirely.

The film doesn't spoon feed you. You need to have some patience with the story. If you want everything laid out for you then go watch ""What to Expect When Expecting"" or other watered down tripe.

A lot of people complain that this movie is ""too depressing."" Well, is life always a Disney movie? Go watch Bambi and I guarantee you'll feel more uplifted and more intellectually stimulated. This film is not only a film but a piece of art.  Its meaning survives beyond the survival of the characters. We care for them and their plight and if we look deep enough we will see our own humanity in them.

And to those who complain about the language. Did you not read the rating? Rated R. You can even see a description to why it is rated that way. The only person to blame is you. Go watch a movie with less language and you'll be content but remember what the rating is.

As to the scene where Neeson's character ""blasphemes"" God. Well, I'm a Christian and even though I felt strong emotions as I saw the scene, I felt it was powerful. I have to ask you this: Were all the prophets of the Bible 100% faithful at all times. No, the were human as well. And some even complained against God. Even Jesus questioned why God had abandoned Him.

Would you, in those circumstances, question God? Well, you don't know do you. That's the point of the film, to get you to see how you would act in those positions. It would at least get you to question mortality and the role God plays in it. Don't you think its time to finally get off your moral high horse?",1342569600,3,2009,4.298941798941799

The ending is very appropriate and a twist and surprise, but still, a moving, powerful ending and performance by all the actors.  As to the wolves, alot of CGI yes, but well done, and of course there is exaggeration.  But to those that say how they are put into too negative a light, it's a story for god's sake, and the cute, cuddly version of packs that get shown on National Geographic to me are just as disturbing for being utter BS.  These animals are capable, and proven, to be supreme killers, that will kill more than they can eat given the chance and the good folks that live in the bush in AK can attest to it.

4782801,3,B005LAIIS0,"Director Joe Carnahan made such a promising and exciting start in the feature film business with the 70's crime drama throwback NARC. It was strong, exciting and a shot in the arm to a tiring genre. He followed that up with the bizarre yet oddly entertaining ensemble actioner SMOKING ACES, but once locked into the Hollywood machine, he did the unnecessary but not-too-terrible film version of the 80's TV show THE A-TEAM, which teamed him for the first time with strong dramatic actor who became rebranded as action star Liam Neeson. This somehow led to THE GREY, a film that is not the survival adventure promised in the previews. THE GREY is an occasionally thoughtful, extremely existental, and ultimately predictible Man Versus Nature drama.

We have John Ottway (Neeson, finally being allowed to speak in his natural accent), a gruff and suicidally depressed ""exterminator"" of sorts who works on an oil-drilling site in Alaska. His job essentially consists of picking off nasty man-eating wolves that look to use the workers as kibble with his rifle. He ponders poetically about his wife and how he misses her and how he knows he'll never be with her again. The other workers are, for the most part, societal outcasts; they're ex-cons, drifters, quick to anger and violence, meaning that Ottway is right at home with them. But it's time for them to go home, so they catch a plane back to Anchorage. There are warnings of a storm, or as co-writers Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers (who wrote the short story this film is based on) call it, foreshadowing. The plane naturally crashes (in an uncomfortably effective set piece) and Ottway finds himself taking charge of a ragged and motley crew of survivors and look to stay alive amongst the harsh weather of the Alaska's snowy wastelands. Before too long, it seems that Ottway's work has followed him to the crash site as they soon find themselves surrounded by a pack of vicious ravening wolves. So instead of this being a story about men coming together and fighting the elements, it becomes something of a horror film as the men begin getting picked off one by one as Ottway tries to lead them to safety.

Despite the film's massive leaps of logic and sense in order to manufacture forward momentum, it's an interesting film to watch. Carnahan does a commendable job of showing the brutal and unforgiving climate and also shows some beautiful vistas of the Alaskan wilderness. He's also pretty good at creating suspense, but it's really just enough to keep you watching despite knowing just about everything that's going to happen. You know that the film will become allegorical at one point for the behavior of the animals and the behavior of the men. You know there will be someone that will eventually challenge Ottway's ""alpha"" status, and that comes in the form of Diaz (the most interesting character of the film as played by a very volatile Frank Grillo, a great character actor). The whole cast of survivors, including Dallas Roberts and a very unrecognizable Dermot Mulroney, essentially seem to be analogues of the cast of John Carpenter's arctic existential horror masterpiece THE THING, but even that's not a terribly new idea. Survival thrillers often have the same archetypal characters. The film also delves into the nature of humanity's faith and the existence of a higher power, and this is where the film succeeds at being surprising yet unnecessarily ham-fisted as it becomes the love-child of Jack London and Samuel Beckett by way of Carnahan's profanity-and-gore-laden narrative. Neeson does nice work here and it further cements his current bad-ass status, but this is not even as interesting or as memorable of a role as Bryan Mills in TAKEN.

Where I think the biggest disconnect is between audiences and this film is, exists in the realm of its marketing. This film promises certain things in the trailers and the commercials but doesn't live up to them, and the most glaring example of that is in the film's climax which is the very end of the film. While the moment promised to us is hardly the point of the film, it's something that everyone wanted to see, and when that was taken away from us, we felt cheated. There's truth to that. Most of the negative reviews specifically have to do with the film's ending and how it didn't live up to some very specific expectations, and that's more to do with the marketing than the film, because this is a film where the narrative isn't dependent on a climactic showdown between Ottway and the wolves; it's a more contemplative film than that. So I just don't think that we can blame Carnahan for the ending not meeting those expectations; Universal wanted to get butts in seats and what better way to do that with a film like this than the promise of Liam Neeson taping broken glass to his fists to do battle with a wolf?

One way or the other, the biggest problem with THE GREY is that it attempts to be a thought-provoking piece of the existental crisis of Man Versus Nature, but because it's more structured like a survival horror film, it ends up not being terribly successful in either way.

Something along those lines. Man vs. his elements.  In that regard, it was along the same lines as ""Cast Away"", though the elements were much more dangerous, and the movie, not nearly as good.

A man is hired by an oil company to work in an isolated location in the arctic. [The changing scenes are a distraction; this is a movie not a puzzle.] His job is to kill wolves near the settlement to protect the workers. [What attracts them?] Men board an airplane to leave for vacation (or rotation). Alwin wants quiet; he remembers his past. There is turbulence from a storm. There is noise before the crash. Alwin awakes in the snow and finds the crashed plane. There are survivors, some are wounded and die. [What is the point to this scene?] Another man laughs. Seven are left. They must start a fire, then walk south. They won't be easily found. [The language may be realistic but is overdone.] A wolf shows up to scavenge the dead. [Should they leave the crash site?] One man bleeds from a wolf bite. Is that wolf part of a pack? They might attack if they have a den nearby.

There is conflict among the men. [The darkness detracts from story.] The men joke over their situation. More wolves show up. They keep a fire going. A wolf attacks but is driven off. Daylight reveals dead bodies. They decide to head for the trees. They collect wallets for the families. The talk tells about their characters. Alwin searches the wreckage. ""God bless these men."" Wolves attack a straggler; he bleeds out. Dusk brings the wolves. ""They're all around us!"" A fire is lit just in time. ""It worked."" Alwin has a way to use a shotgun shell against a wolf. ""I'm not scared."" They hear the growl of a wolf. Then a wolf attacks! The men kill it, then hear the howls from the pack. They will cook and eat it. The wolves howl again.

They continue to move out and find a refuge. The high altitude has an effect on a man. Alwin remembers his past as a child. There is a storm with high winds. One man doesn't wake up. They are near a river and devise a way to escape down a cliff with an improvised rope. One man has a problem. They continue to walk by the river. [No compass to guide them?] One man wants to rest. Is he tired of life? The two continue to walk. Two wolves approach and the men run. One falls into the fast-flowing river and is caught. Alwin expresses his frustration then continues to walk through the trees. He pauses, then hears a growl from wolves. ""Once more into the fray."" Will you be surprised by the ending? [Was this movie a too subtle story of the effect of the economic depression of workers?]

You can blame the producer, director, screenwriter, and the author of the original short story for this movie. It is not so much bad as not good. You may be sorry you spent two hours watching this movie. I understand that if you survive a plane crash you should remain near the wreck as it is more visible from any search plane. A smoky fire is a signal for help. This could have been titled ""Jaws in the Woods"". It is another horror story. This production company could have used somebody to critique their plot before they implemented it. Or whatever they use to plan a production. I heard the name ""Alwin"" but the credits say ""Ottway"". They needed to carry a pistol whenever you travel in a wild country. You never know.",1341705600,2,3153,4.375426621160409

4782808,4,B005LAIIS0,"When watching this movie I was not at all surprised by how much I enjoyed this movie as it offers so much to the audience, to name a few aspects of this movie that I enjoyed very much would have to be action,suspense,a very well written story,drama, character development, and much more. This movie is set in Alaska and this certainly adds to the challenge of staying alive, we even get a really good look at how this environment affects each character. (No I don't just mean the shivering or a red nose) What I mean is that the weather slowly but surely wears each and every character down, even to the point where one character dies due to the weather. You (the audience) begin to get a feel for just how scared and desperate each character  becomes as their hope for survival begins to dwindle down to nothing.

This story follows 6 oil pipeline workers and a skilled hunter who was hired by the pipeline to protect the workers from the wolves that attempt to attack the workers. While the workers are returning home their plane crashes and they are forced to cooperate in order to survive. However the challenge of survival becomes even more difficult when they quickly realize that a local pack of wolves begins to hunt them one by one and they are forced to fight for their lives. Can the survivors band together,put aside any past differences and make it out alive? Or will they all just perish in the snow?

I have to limit exactly what I tell you in this review without spoiling the movie for you, however, I will say that ending  may seem a TINY bit unsatisfying but due to the direction the film was taken, you can see its necessity.",1341619200,,1644,4.47
4782869,1,B005LAIIS0,"The only reason to watch this movie is to enjoy Mr. Neeson. The movie itself is absolutely absurd. ""Mr. Outdoors"", played by Neeson made every wrong decision starting with his employment at the oil camp.
So many dreadful errors in judgements made me want to turn the movie off, as did the stereotyping of the differing characters, especially the former prison inmate.
I won't get into why there were shotgun shells found but no shotgun or how Mr. Neesons rifle was broken while it's case remained intact.
I won't go into detail as to why on earth they ever left the relative safe haven they could have made the remnants of the crashed aircraft into while awaiting rescue (there are two black boxes on such aircraft, all of them, that transmit signalling information for a very long time).
I won't go into detail about why Mr Neeson didn't die of hypothermia after his little river excursion late in the movie.
And I won't express my disgust with the ending of the movie.

The first being is how they portray wolves. Absolute rubbish and not anywhere near how these magnificent creatures behave. But, as I mentioned, had it been classified as a horror film I would perhaps have forgiven this absurdity. The ""wolves"" in this film all had glowing eyes and looked ridiculously fake as to be laughable.  King Kong in the original film looked more believable. Christ, couldn't the director have at least used some stock film footage of REAL wolves.

Let's forget about the ""wolves"" and move on to these seven men who miraculously survived a plane crash at 400MPH! Throughout the film they are subjected to extreme bitter cold temperatures, numerous accidents and a few vicious attacks by the ""wolves'. Yet, miraculously, their wounds seemed to simply disappear, and not ONE ever shows signs of experiencing any signs of frost bite. Well....maybe a few sniffles here and there, but nothing that wiping their nose could not handle so that they could move on in this film.

In one scene Liam Neeson spends a good amount of time in freezing water (which would obviously kill a man), but yet again, when he gets out he shows no signs of being the least bit cold, and miraculously his clothes dry out in a matter of minutes. One man actually leaped about 30 feet across a ravine into a tree and ended up with nothing more than simply letting out a grunt (Rocky the Flying Squirrel?)

4783370,5,B005LAIIS0,"This is a mystical metaphysical journey through the purification of a soul.  At the beginning the main character holds a gun in his mouth because the pain from his lost love is unbearable.  Isn't that the worst pain for most of us, lost love? Some try to drown it out with substance abuse, anger, hatred and other forms of avoidance. Who suffers such loss head on? Only the strongest parts of our soul can endure this, our love, and our charity turned outwards.  John manifests this attribute when he listens to the call from the wilderness, the howl representing the void in his soul that needs to be filled with meaning.  His existential journey begins as he merges both his masculine and feminine parts of his soul.  He both protects and nurtures. Although his job is one of a sniper who protects others by shooting wolves he begins the collections of wallets, representing the collection of souls by this human Michael the Arc angel. Obviously, these demons pursuing this man have met their match.  Throughout the movie John who leaves his alter suicidal personality at the log, turns his back on the head demon, (see his claw mark on his back of the guy left at the log).  John is on the Journey Saint John of the Cross describes in his book Dark Night of the Soul.  He asked each dyeing person to hold on to images of Love (which is God's presence in the world).  The guy at the log, (also John) does not have a memory of love (Knowledge/dogma) and makes his at his last mindful moment when he shakes John's and the other man's hand.  The main character the human Michael the Arc Angel takes us on his journey, one of faith, hope and charity not dogmatic bible thumping lunacy. Knowledge is abandoned in exchange for faith and hope. He is the symbol of humility before God; he is the prince who stands up for his people, the great protector and the leader of the army of God against the forces of evil.

4783372,4,B005LAIIS0,"Review may contain spoilers.

I absolutely love Liam Neeson, he's probably one of my favorite actors. Now, while this movie was advertised as an intense action film, it's not. If you're expecting action and love action flicks, then don't even bother watching this. It's more of a psychological drama with a few witty lines/moments thrown in. This isn't a movie for everybody. It's depressing and doesn't necessarily have a ""Hollywood ending"".

This movie is about hope and losing it. It's about seeing a glimpse of that hope and then accidentally going in the wrong direction. It's about having the will to fight and giving up. It's frustration and fear. These are things that people don't want to see or feel. But then keep in mind it's a movie, not a documentary.

Honestly, I originally didn't wanna see the movie because I thought it was going to be a cheesy action movie. I love action flicks as much as the next person, but action movies eventually lose it's substance. Drawn out and boring. This movie was nowhere near that. It lacked action sequences (which everybody loves apparently), but had what I look for in a movie. Something dark. Definitely best ending I've seen in a long time.

For everyone saying, they shoulda done this or shoulda done that...you wouldn't know what to do because you'd be too shocked to think straight and you've probably never been in that kind of situation. Too much foul language and gore? Ummm, clearly it's marked rated R, what are you expecting? Unrealistic animal behavior? Yeah, because you know every single wolf out there and they clearly all act the same. We're animals and we've heard of the most unbelievable stories of humans behaving odd, so I'm sure there are odd animals out there that behave strangely and out of the norm.

4783507,4,B005LAIIS0,"A chilling tale about savagery, death and the belief in the afterlife. Tale focuses on a bunch of oil riggers stranded in snowy Alaska after a plane crash. Only a handful of them survived and they are lacking in the bare necessities while a wolf pack tracks them down, picking them off one by one. The survivors desperately try to get away and seek a safer venue. Liam Neeson is the main star of this film with a somewhat good to good supporting cast. Neeson plays the expert on wolves attempting to give advice to the survivors who are in over their heads and half the time bickering with one another or failing to take the wolf situation seriously enough.

Part of the ""fun"" is seeing how the ""oh so clever"" wolves pick people off. The actions and strategies of the wolves are controversial. Uninformed people act like wolves never attack people out in remote areas but if you do some research you will see the movie isn't always wrong in how it depicts wolf activities. Now, are they are smart as shown in the film? Probably not. Some are arguing the wolves are symbolisms for the Grip Reaper coming to get us but that is another discussion.

In the end if you accept the possibility that wolves could attack a group of wounded humans then this is a fun survival tale with a gruesome ending. BTW, it was marketed as an action film in some circles and that is totally dead wrong. They filmed this picture in 40 days and it was based on a short story by Ian MacKenzie.

Wolf lovers have boycotted this film arguing wolves never attack people but that's inaccurate and up to major discussions on the forums.

I've read some reviews that indicate that viewers are unhappy by what is apparently an ambigious ending,and judging by the final scene before the end credits roll, it does look that way. However,if you scroll through the ending credits you'll see a final very short scend of what appears to be the black alpha wolf laying on it's side,perhaps breathing its' last. The camera pans along the length of the still breathing body and stops on a shock of black hair raising up from the wolfs' body. If you look closely you can see that it appears to be attached to a human scalp as pink skin can be seen underneath the shock of hair. This final scene would seem to indicate that the battle is just ended and John Ottway and the wolf have killed each other. I may be wrong,but I think that this is a reasonable conclusion judging by that final short scene,which at least for me ,brings the movie to a final conclusion.

4783695,5,B005LAIIS0,"To start with the viewer will note that the wolf behavior is highly dramatized, even has a supernatural feel. However, the movie does a good job of offering reasons a wolf pack 'might' behave with such aggression. Forget all that, this isn't really too much about the wolves behavior, other than on the surface. I felt the thrill of a Jack London adventure tale (which I adore). Not only is it Man vs. Nature, but it is Man vs. Man and Man vs. Himself all rolled into one and in the most extreme. The biggest obstacle the main character truly has to overcome is his past and the ability to choose life over death in the first place. If you were left out in nature what would keep you going forward? Why do some people become leaders and others just give up? What in your past has shaped who you are in your future? There were so many layers of questions about human nature and a deeper thread wound through this story that I can hardly see it as just a life and death adventure tale. One particular scene really spooked me (and I had to watch a couple times). When they are pursued by the wolves and standing by the fire look closely at the tree line...very eerie effect. It has a very symbolic 'shadow of death' quality I couldn't help but admire. I recall a time up in Leadville, Colorado when I heard wolves in the far distance. It was both beautiful and haunting at the same time. I swore I saw this in the tree line as I looked at the snow on the ground that night under the moonlight. I quickly retreated to my car and slept there rather than my tent! I got the same chill up my spine while I watched this movie. Very well done. Just keep in mind that as with Jaws and other movies like it that this is 'over the top' Hollywood drama, not necessarily true animal behavior.",1339977600,2,1778,4.263313609467455
4783696,2,B005LAIIS0,"Oh Liam... What are you doing with your career?

Come on man!  You were Qui-Gon Jin for god's sake!  You were in Batman!  I'll admit that Battleship was a bit of a disappointment, but this... Holy crap!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

Okay so Liam is playing a guy who kills wolves for a living and keeps oil workers safe in Alaska while they work on pipes for a nameless oil company.  So why are they all drinking, fighting, and gambling?  People in the freezing wasteland of Alaska really have nothing better to do with their time?  Okay sure, why not?

Then the plane they're on crashes, and get this.  Liam's character lays down across 3 seats and belts himself in with all 3 seatbelts, yet he's thrown a few hundred feet away from the plane and the seats he belted himself to are nowhere to be seen.  Okay, I'll roll with it.

Plane crash survival 101, STAY WITH THE WRECKAGE!!!  Unless you crash in the ocean and the plane sinks, STAY WITH THE WRECKAGE!!!  It's MUCH easier to find the wreckage of a plane than it is a single person wandering around in the woods.  Plus planes have transmitters on them that are linked with satellites, the second you hit the ground it alerts FAA and Search and Rescue teams will be dispatched.  If you're in Alaska it may be a little while until they get there, but trust me, they WILL come.  Plus there is food, water and emergency survival supplies that will last until the SAR teams arrive.

Also you're telling me that this guy who is a professional sharp-shooter and knows everything there is about his rifle, picks up his rifle, sees that the stock is broken and comes to the conclusion that the rifle is destroyed and throws it away?  Seriously?  The gun itself still works fine, it's just going to be a lot harder to aim, it'll still fire and you can still use it to defend yourself.

On top of that, please do NOT do what they did in this movie and try to make ""boomsticks"" with shotgun shells and think they'll fire normally.  Outside of a shotgun if they detonate they'll just explode.

The entire time Liam is wandering around the Alaskan wasteland, this letter to his, wife/girlfriend is something he pulls out and looks at once in a while is always fine.  The ink that is written on the paper never runs, even AFTER he plunges into a river, it's still perfectly legible.  Plus when they guy gets his foot stuck in the rocks under the water and he's drowning, why doesn't he just yank his foot out of his boot?  On top of that, if Liam really fell into a freezing river in Alaska, he would die from hypothermia in like 15 minutes, yet according to Hollywood he's just fine.

Oh and F.Y.I. wolves do NOT attack people!  They are scared of people and they are scared of fire, even in packs they will run from people.  Bears on the other hand... well let's just say that they're a little more aggressive.  But the wolves are the main thing about this movie that I did like, they looked really cool.

The ending was kinda lame where they cut to black before we can see who wins the fight.  Oh if you wait until the end you see that Liam is laying on the corpse of the alpha male wolf, but neither of them are moving so I assume that means they killed each other.

4783777,2,B005LAIIS0,"Wolves should sue this production for defamation of character. They look unreal and ridiculous here for no good reason. Even if you take the wolves and their attacks to be mythic, serving as metaphors for the approach of death that we all face - their presence in this film still doesn't work. More compelling, genuine metaphors could have been found for mortality.

Although I was somewhat prepared for this film to fail in concept, I thought it might at least give me a chance to see some real wolves close-up, to look into their intense, intelligent eyes. But this movie affords no such opportunity for nature study. Don't think you'll see much of any actual wolves here. In most instances, the film substitutes improbable, Claymation-like mock-ups for real wolves in what few murky close-ups you do get. Godzilla looked like a more realistic, less laughable lizard than these animals look like representatives of their species.

Then I thought well, at least I might get a few survival tips from this film. Wrong again. Neeson's character makes the absurd decision to lead the other plane crash survivors away from the relative safety of the plane wreckage - across a vast expanse of snow - into the woods. All right, once having negotiated past this exposure, I thought the men could survive any subsequent wolf attacks by simply climbing a tree. However metaphoric these wolves, they surely couldn't be shown climbing trees in pursuit of their prey. But no one here thinks to climb a tree. Instead, Neeson leads his remaining men on to swing over a chasm. Why?

Finally I thought, well, this film might still be salvageable if developed as a revenge-on-humanity tale along the lines of ""The Birds."" This film starts with that potential when we early see Neeson's character, hired to kill any predators that might threaten the drilling operation in Alaska, shooting a wolf and presiding over its somewhat lingering death. I thought any subsequent wolf attacks might be framed as payback for the callous caging and killing we inflict on other species. But no, the movie doesn't take advantage of that potential springboard into a plotline.

There are a few almost touching moments in the last quarter of the film, as the men drop their continuous, pointless cursing at each other and become more sympathetic in their reflections on death. However, these moments aren't nearly enough to rescue any of these antagonists, or this film, from becoming simply a nonsensical, gory mess.",1339891200,2,2483,4.961538461538462

Unfortunately Liam had to know after reading the script that this was a film being created that would only be a win for him.  So often this happens with actors who have achieved great success that they begin to lower their standards for the right film, the right script.  This was one of the poorest films I have ever seen.  The 'F' word used in every sentence and sometimes multiple times, only because the writer could not do a better job.  The realism of their plight was lacking, some of the wolves looked fake, all in all I would like my money back.  I'll watch 'Taken' again and remind myself that Liam Neeson is still a great actor, however in the future will not buy one of his films without seeing some of the reviews.",1339891200,5,805,4.333333333333333
4783779,3,B005LAIIS0,". . . slightly provocative flick.  And this comes from someone who has been pretty down on Liam Neeson's stuff lately.  Neeson plays a tired by life game hunter employed by Alaskan oil companies to protect remote workers from attack by Grey Wolves.  His flight back to Anchorage from a remote work site goes down in a snow storm and he and 7 other survivors must battle nature and face their own mortality to survive . . .  and then . . . of course . . . there are the wolves . . .

A visually beautiful film.  Shot well.  The characters are somehow- though I am not sure how- decently enough developed to care about and the story is solid and not cookie cutter.  I kept thinking I knew where this movie was going- but it fooled me a bit.  A few surprises.  And some interesting dialogue.  Some good acting in this movie from some barely knowns.

The big ""huh?"" thing on this movie you just have to accept is that there is no rescue coming for this downed plane- and that isn't really explained or even questioned enough by the survivors- at least not to my plausible satisfaction.  But - if you can get past that- it is pretty good film overall.

A fair comparison might be a WW2 movie expecting ""Saving Private Ryan"" and getting ""Schindler's List.""  Just because you expect one thing and get another, doesn't change the value of the movie's worth, just the reliability of movie trailers.  Don't be so negative.

This movie is good.  Primordially good.  If you listen to it and watch it, it grants you a glimpse of how to face Oblivion.  Liam Neeson's performance is masterful; and the character written for him to portray is complex and full of life.  The entire movie is him ""not going gentle into that good night.""  The ending is stellar and resonates hope.

Possible SPOILDER ALERT
There is a lot of controversy about the abruptness of the ending.  At first, I was like wtf much like everyone else.  There IS a sequence after the credits roll.  And then I understood the reasoning behind the filmmakers.  This movie in my opinion is about two aspects of facing death, that is, quitting and going home early versus standing your ground, not giving up.  One day, guaranteed, it may look like the credits of YOUR life are going to start to roll...and you may just give up and think that it HAS to be the end.  Yet, if you stand your ground and simply wait, there will be more.  It's not over until someone turns on the lights. I've never seen a director use the ending credits as a metaphor.

4783831,1,B005LAIIS0,"Ok, I rented the movie and watched it online.  I was very disappointed that this movie was so poorly directed.  I couldn't help but note the following discrepancies on the Director's part; 1. Doesn't know anything about guns, whatsoever 2. Don't have any idea what the North Slope of Alaska looks like 3. Don't have a clue about wolf behavior 4. Don't have a clue about what Alaska looks like (the part of Alaska that they were supposedly in)5. Sadly, like most people think all Alaskan's live in igloo's and it is cold all the time. 6. Have no concept of how long a flight from the North Slope to Anchorage would take 7. The depiction of how much daylight there would be with the weather was not accurate.  I will explain all of these further

First of all the ignorance about guns. I howled with laughter when I saw Liam Neeson shoot a wolf that was running at full speed with a scoped rifle.  It is hard to hit a wolf running with a rifle in the first place, or any other animal for that matter that is moving at high speeds.  Hitting it on the run with a scoped rifle is near impossible, but not impossible-you can always get lucky I guess.  The director also needs to pay attention to what kind of ammunition a rifle takes, and what kind of ammunition a shotgun takes. Obviously, you can't fire a shotgun shell in a rifle or rifle ammunition in a shotgun.  Imagine my surprise and disappointment when I saw Liam dig out 12 gauge shells and make like they were for his rifle. One more thing.  Do not, I repeat, do not try to do what they were doing with shotgun shells, ie making thunder sticks, lol.  You will get hurt extremely bad, I can almost guarantee it.

The director has absolutely no clue what the North Slope of Alaska looks like, where the Oil fields are.  The North Slope is for the most part flat as a pancake and the tundra turns into gigantic pools of mosquito infested swampy habitat in the summer.  Summer? In Alaska?  I will get to that later for the people who are reading this and are that ignorant. If you have seen the arctic national wildlife refuge films which show caribou running through pristine mountain ranges....well, you guessed it, not accurate.  Anwar is also flat as a pancake.  It is always disputed whether to allow the big evil oil companies to drill for oil there or not.  The area was basically stolen by Jimmy Carter from the Alaskan people in one weekend during his presidency, and made a Federal preserve.  There is only about 70 people who live in ANWR on the coast, and all of them want to drill baby drill.  I agree, it is absolutely mentally challenged to not develope the resources there because of the potential environmental impact.  Of course the Natives are so greedy, I don't know if it would be cost effective to drill there anyway.  They are the big reason why it is so expensive up on the slope.  Anyway, the slope is flat as a pancake.

As for wolf behavior.....There has only been one case of a wolf attacking a human in North America.  It was a little boy who was bit on the butt by a young wolf.  The wolf was thought to have rabies, and was destroyed.  Turns out the wolf did not have rabies, and it was unclear why the boy was bitten.  This occurred in Alaska a few years back.  Anyway, they don't attack humans the way the movie depicted.  Back in the dark ages in Europe, there were many wolf attacks resulting in thousands of human deaths.  This was a learned behavior, and once they realized humans were easy picking, it was on.  Their normal food sources were seriously dwindled down to almost nothing also, which resulted in them attacking humans in Europe.  In Alaska there are way to many wolves. Every attempt to thin the numbers by the state of Alaska is met with severe resistance by tree huggers from the lower 48, who most don't know their butt from a hole in the ground, let alone managing wildlife. I am for shooting them from airplanes or even poisoning them.  You would have to realize how the moose and caribou herds have dwindled down because of wolf over population.  Anyway, the director who directed this movie has no clue about wolf behavior.

Alaska has seven mountain ranges, and the mountain ranges that they would have crashed into in the movie, looks absolutely nothing like it did in the movie, lol. The biggest discrepancy was how big the trees were. It could have been filmed in the Kenai Peninsula, but looked like Washington or Oregon maybe.  The fella dying of altitude sickness, totally made me laugh out loud. Anywhere there is a lack of oxygen is going to be above the tree line.  In the lower 48, which is what Alaskans affectionately call the part of the United States below Canada, the tree line is about 11,000 feet give or take some. In Alaska, the tree line is only about 3000 feet.  The man would never have died from altitude sickness at the altitude they were in the movie. lol  Man, this director was either a total idiot, or just thinks most people are.

On the plane before the crash, everybody is asleep at one point.  Although Alaska is two and a half times the size of Texas, the flight from the slope to Anchorage takes roughly one hour and forty minutes, so the likelihood of everybody sleeping is slim to none.  Heck, they wouldn't even have time to serve drinks hardly!

As for all the people who are so ignorant that they think all Alaskans live in snow bound conditions year round and in igloos.  It gets hotter than hades in parts of Alaska in the summer.  Mainly on the slope and interior, not on the South coastal areas though.  Temperatures in Fairbanks get over a hundred degrees in the Summer.  It has something to do with the 24 hours of daylight this time of year.  That brings me to my next topic, I don't think the amount of daylight depicted in the movie matches the weather in the movie.  I mean, it would not be that cold up there with that much snow, if they had that much daylight.  If it is that cold and snowing, there would almost be total darkness.  Once again poor directing without enough research.

The above where just some of the obvious discrepancies with the movie.  It wasn't a bad movie, but it really pains me to see how ignorant some people are about the 49th state. When I watch a movie I always look for accuracy, I just can't help myself.  Liam Neeson is a great actor, and I always like movies with him.  I can't really remember a bad one with him in it.

One final note, how did I miss this?  The North Slope oil producing areas are all dry, meaning absolutely no alcohol.  If you are caught bringing it into the work or sleep areas, you will be fired, no questions asked.  Believe it or not people can't go two weeks without a drink.  That is what they work two weeks on two weeks off-12 hour shifts. NO ALCOHOL! Poor research on the director/writers part.",1339545600,13,6816,4.422953451043338

They can't even have a normal conversation without throwing a ""F this S"" and ""MF don't TELL me what to do"". It's ridiculous how often they swear...it's just as annoying as if they were saying ""giraffe"" every five seconds.

The wolves are digital...enough said. I hate digital crap it looks beyond fake. Jurassic Park is 19 years old and the dinosaurs today still look way more realistic than any digital stuff in today's movies. Also, the wolves are way too big and sometimes aren't even making wolf sounds...Hollywood created their own sounds to try and make them scarier. I give props to the 2006 horror flick ""The Breed"" for using real dogs.

The actors aren't convincing and I could care less if any of them die in the flick, but they try to make it sad every time one of them gets killed.

Not sure why others didn't like it - maybe expecting too much or more of a hollywood spin - but this movie doesn't take the high or low road. It just is.

Liam Neeson plays a great role. The other actors are excellent too. You see men who have to wake up and deal with their feelings about the reality of their life and the prospects of dying or living.

First of all, Liam Neeson was absolutely brilliant. All of the acting in this movie was superb. The score was perfect. The cinematography was gorgeous as well.

This is not an action movie about wolves. This is a story about choosing how you die and how that reflects the way you chose to live. This is a story about love and brotherhood and fear and survival. Perhaps, it's even about violating nature and the karmic consequences of our abuses. If you're expecting something cliche then you might be disappointed, but if you're open minded you just might love it. We're all going to die one day. How will you live now? How will you face death when it comes for you?

4783903,1,B005LAIIS0,"Movie is based on a short story which doomed it from the start because we know how much research and effort goes into a short story. A good story takes years to write and rewrite and involves a lot of research. Not in this case. Too many holes not well thought out for a reality based story. I, like many others, bought the movie because of Liam and his face is prominent on the cover. Should have been a wolf - at least you would get to see one.
Problems:
(1.) The initial scenes of a a bunch of guys drinking and brawling seemed too much like Hollywood script writers copying an old western saloon.
(2.) Liam's suicide thoughts were just a distraction and out of place.
(3.) The plane crash sequence, which was imaginatively created from the passengers pov turned out to be just cheap filming as all we're shown is a subsequent scene of a partial plane and stuff strewn on snow. And the usual couple of burning fires.
(4.) The drunken cowboy stereotypes as survivors continue which under the circumstances didn't seem to fit workers accustomed to working in those difficult conditions.
(5.) Usual dumb decisions like not fashioning snow shoes (easy to do from plastic suitcases and webbing; not making weapons from aluminum as defense against predators; not making torches; not gathering more than one lighter; not punching more holes in fuel tanks for kerosene; not using powder from bullets for small explosives; not making aluminum trekking poles. Basically not good planning while not searching for survival materials.
(6.) The shotgun shells on sticks seemed to have gotten lost - not that it was explained that well in the first place.
(7.) Final scenes of not fashioning a crutch or carrier for the leg injured survivor; being submerged in freezing water and when Liam gets out he's not shivering or hypothermic. Should have been dead, if not while in the water, then soon afterwards.
(8.) Not trying to find a path down a small cliff - the wolves seemed to have had no problems.
(9.) The behavior and pursuit by the wolves was way over the top - thought I was watching ""Twilight"". Their brief momentary cameos in scenes and even the artificially reflective eyes was just cheap cinematography.

4784020,2,B005LAIIS0,"Beware: This movie is not what you think it is.  The movie studio spent tons of money advertising a kick-butt action movie with the latest, greatest action star: Liam Neeson.  What you'll get instead is a deeply psychological, slow story with a few bursts of action.

The movie starts by showing that Liam Neeson's job is to project the oil workers from wolves and other predators.  It starts a little slow but luckily you don't have to wait long for the plane to crash.  Somehow, several of the men survive but immediately realize they are being preyed upon by a pack of wolves.  Instead of staying by the plane, they decide to huff it out through the wilderness to get back to civilization.  The plot goes downhill from there.  As the men are picked off one by one, you (the viewer) will get more frustrated with the insane abilities of the wolves to traverse ravines and teleport miles ahead of the survivors.  The wolves are also a combination of CG and puppets, which lack realism at almost all times.  I won't spoil the ending, but I will say that the audience in the theater booed when the movie ended.

The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that Liam Neeson is a master.  I will love him in pretty much anything he does, and he takes his art seriously.  Unfortunately, he is severely limited by the plot in the movie.

I so wanted to like this movie, but it wasn't to be.  This movie was not worth the $10 at the theater and I don't really recommend spending your hard-earned dough to buy it.  Rent with care.",1338940800,2,1537,4.397163120567376

While this movie could have provided insights in how people face death, it fell flat on its face.  The wolves were portrayed with an uncanny ability to leap tall buildings in a single bound or a very large canyon while the humans were portrayed as stupid and having absolutely no common sense at all. The scenes showing Neeson's character with his wife were unconvincing in that she was supposedly dying and yet her makeup was perfect and she looked like she could walk the runway at any minute.  With movie technology being what it is, the wolves were more cartoonish than scary and we were never really able to see them anyway.  I will not spoil for the ending for those who wish to view this movie.

I love Liam Neeson (usually) but really felt his acting was wooden and one-dimensional in ""The Grey.""

Another problem - I rented this on Amazon as a 24-hour rental and as such, I don't get Closed Captioning. And with Neeson's heavy accent and my poor hearing, I had to keep backing the film up so I could catch what was being said.  That took a lot of the spontaneity out of watching the film.

This was a crazy story.  Neeson is the hunter, keeping the wolves away from the oil workers - and kind of ""wolf whispering"" them into the next life as they die.  He does the same for the airplane crash survivors as they die during the film (kind of odd for a self-proclaimed atheist).

The scenery was beautiful, the wolves were spooky, and the acting was so-so. So unless you just have to see every Neeson movie made, I would skip this one.

4784024,4,B005LAIIS0,"I'm rather surprised by all the negative reviews this little film has gotten. Between the frighteningly loony animal rights activists and those turned off by the dark nature of the story, The Grey can't seem to catch a break, which is a real shame. For something that, by all means, should have been okay at best, The Grey manages to be a flawed, yet pretty compelling film. Joe Carnahan hasn't made a good film since NARC, and it's awesome to see something watchable coming from him. Liam Neeson plays himself for the most part, and yet he fits the movie quite nicely with Frank Grillo doing a surprisingly good job infusing some life into a character that could've very well been awfully bland. Again, it's not a perfect movie, but it's certainly doesn't deserve the hate it's been getting from critics and audiences alike.

One thing I would like to point out is that the negative reviews often highlight the gore and themes as the reason they are rating the film poorly. It was obvious from the start that this wasn't going to be the feel good movie of the year, and it's ridiculous to hate a movie because it made you sad. Often times, that's the point. Stick to Disney movies if a movie depressing you is enough for you to condemn it. For those of you looking for an interesting film with a good cast, great cinematography, and one of the better endings to come out of Hollywood in the last couple of years, I wholeheartedly suggest you find and watch The Grey as soon as you can.

The Grey is an action/drama about a pack of roughnecks versus a pack of wolves in the frozen tundra.

Well, it was amazing!  Extremely intense and emotional. All three of us sat for seconds after the ending just staring at the credits and then jumped into animated conversation about how it affected each of us.
The movie wasn't about the CG wolves, it was about the men who went through the experience and how each handled the slim chance of surviving their situation.  It was CHARACTER driven and Liam Neeson is at his best.
I would have given 5 stars but the movie does drag a bit.  It could have been about 15 minutes shorter all told without harming it's impact.

As a friend of mine often says, ""It is what it is"".  Meaning take it for what it is because we can't always have what we want and we must use what we have.  Even survivalist will find some of it daunting.  Perhaps the cold and hunger affects their judgement because there are some mistakes made.  But then even in the best of conditions people prove they are only human every day.  Some perhaps expect perfect heroes that have all the answers, and they aren't in this movie.

You will learn from it and Liam Neeson gives a magnificent performance.  He has perfected his craft and does a wonderful job of pulling us into this cruel wilderness that he must try to survive after a plane crash leaves him and a handful of passenegers alive and surrounded by giant gray wolves.  If you find yourself skeptical of their decisions or the wolves, I'd say you haven't done that much camping in the wild or you aren't familiar with this variety that kills for sport.  Not a day goes by when even smart people make the dumbest decisions that should make them candidates for the Darwin Awards.

Keep in mind this group of survivors has no weapons, only fire to keep the wolves off them.  Add to that most of them are bleeding, and predators like wolves can certainly sense fear as well.  If you're still skeptical of the wolves size and behavior let me tell you I was until I found out it's not unrealistic at all.  I found articles about the large wolf packs in Canada that came from the introduction of 35 large Canadian gray wolves into Idaho and Yellowstone in Wyoming.  So those that tell you wolves aren't like this are basing their opinion on the smaller wolf varieties that were indigenous previously and now thought to be extinct in the United States.  Large packs of gray wolves are now roaming Northern US and they are aggressive enough to have not only attacked livestock, but humans in ever increasing numbers.

4784159,1,B005LAIIS0,the filming was done well...but it was a total waste of time. The movie was almost as bad as castaway.,1338595200,2,102,4.15
4784160,1,B005LAIIS0,"The Grey opens with Liam Neeson shooting a wolf. End of movie for me, but my husband challenged me to watch this nonsense to the bitter end. Apparently the Alaska oil rigs hire sharpshooters to kill wolves, which must unleash some truly bad karma on the blue collar men in this movie. Not to worry, these men deserve to die. Hollywood shows us these dregs of society in their last happy night on earth--after drilling for oil in the wilderness, they go carousing, drinking, fighting, cursing like sailors, I mean, er, oil-rig workers. Then these rowdies board the plane home and for some turbulent reason it crashes. No need to cry for them; they're oil rig workers, and their vocabulary is limited to 4-letter words. Well, except for Liam, of course, who can even recite a poem his dad wrote, something Hemingway-esque, nihilistic and macho. He can also play Mr. Sensitive and hold the hand of a dying man. Funny how this movie tries to give each scumbag a redeeming virtue or a tender moment before a wolf eats him.

So Liam shot a wolf, then the plane crashed in the wilderness and most of the oil workers died. Some survived, even though hungry wolves kept trying to eat them, which is not normal wolf behavior. End of story? No such luck.

The survivors feel lucky, maybe even chosen by God for a higher purpose, but then they keep dying one by one, and frankly it would have been better to die instantly in the crash. No explanation is given for all the wolves of Alaska to come snarling to the plane wreck, driving the survivors into the...forest?? Gosh, men are such idiots! And wolves are such crazed, wild, hungry predators! Nothing noble or beautiful about them, and no reason for Hollywood to make any attempt at portraying them naturally. Hey, National Geographic does that, right? So let's pretend wolves act like this, to make the movie really scary, and let's let some of the men show some humanity, so that viewers don't totally rejoice each time one dies. We haven't sunk to the level of The Hunger Games *yet* -- but this movie might help ease us into the idea that it's fun to watch people die in the wilderness. Especially when they're only guys.

I detest male-bashing, especially in Disney cartoons aimed at kids--fathers are idiots, except Simba's dad, so he has to die in the most traumatizing way Disney can think of. Then again, if guys spend their hard earned money on movies like this, who am I to defend the male gender? Then again...when women waste money on chick flicks such as 27 Dresses, The Notebook, and other embarrassments, I can't defend my gender, either. Better to read a book, perhaps, but the book I'm in the midst of now is Neil Bartlett's translation of Moliere's Don Juan, and the whole human race is looking pretty stupid at the moment. Bring on the fairy tales! At least Moliere's males are witty and funny. Too bad Hollywood forgot how to write dialogue and create memorable characters.

I found the acting well done and the story was decent. I've never heard or read of an actual confirmed wolf attack on humans, I'm sure it has happened but this was the only real inaccuracy I saw with the movie. I'm sure guys working in oil refineries can be crude (anybody know any construction workers because they're basically the same types).

Put your head in the sand if you can't stomach movies that question life. By the way, I didn't find that Liam's character was atheist. I think he was contemplating issues that were very traumatic that may have questioned his faith or existence. He couldn't cope with the depression from the loss of his wife. It's a real issue and just because you're ignorant of feelings and emotions, don't pass judgement on others (this especially goes for all of you hypocrite religious types). In my mind he was actually contemplating God's as well as his own existence and in the end wanted to live more than anything. As dark as it was, it was actually a very uplifting ending.

4784320,4,B005LAIIS0,"The premise of this film is fairly simple to follow. We have a grizzled and suicidal hired gun who makes his money protecting oil workers from wolves and a plan full of these hardened men go down in a plane crash. What ensues is an epic struggle for survival of man versus nature.

What you end up with past this premise is a pretty shocking, fairly brutal and seriously violent series of encounters between the survivors and the elements.......oh and a pack of hungry wolves. For what is a relatively standard nature film, the Grey strays close to the horror genre with a steady, vicious pack of killers attacking the survivors in a methodical one at a time pace. This is almost the Jaws for wolves and it brings back memories of films like the Reef and Black Water.

As if this wasn't enough, the film also contains a heavy-handed dose of metaphysical exposition. We are frequently treated to the insights and narrative of Liam Neeson's character's tortured psyche. The characters at some point begin discussing God and how cruel he is to allow these things to happen. Much of this seems natural given the constant sense of dread these characters feel as they are removed one at a time. Still I did find at a certain point that I had ""gotten it"" and wanted to focus more on the thriller portion of the film than the spiritual meandering.

As to the so-called inaccuracies, do they really matter? When I watched the oft-described shotgun shell scene, it looked to me like everybody sort of used their shells up in one go. The truth is that survivors of catastrophes such as this are often affected by PTSD, as well as being at high altitude in the freezing cold. I am not certain that their actions in any way were entirely inconsistent with a group faced with these circumstances.

All of that said, I felt this was a rock-solid thriller that had a brutal pace and some wicked killers. To me, nothing could be worse than running for my life, being chased by a pack of wolves, knowing that I am surrounded. There is something primal about what is hown here and it definitely tappen into my fears. This film is an easy recommendation for both horror and thriller fans.

4784321,3,B005LAIIS0,"This Liam Neeson vehicle has been marketed as a spirited action movie.  While there is action and suspense, the tone of the film is different than advertised.  It is a morose, nihilistic death march through the Alaskan wilderness.  There never is a ""Rocky"" moment in which the crash survivors turn the tables on the wolfpack.  They are simply there in order to suffer and die.  The pacing is off, with morbid moments that seem to drag on forever.

In all of these ""Ten Little Indians"" type of scenarios, the characters must be sympathetic and well-developed, their deaths plausible, in order for the viewer to feel that he has not been crassly manipulated.  By that standard, this film is not especially well-written.  There may be too many ""Aw, come on!"" moments for viewers.  The Alaskan plane crash premise, along with the battle against an obsessed carnivore, draws comparisons with the old Anthony Hopkins vehicle ""The Edge.""  ""The Edge,"" however, is practically sunny and optimistic compared with this film.

In a way, it is refreshing that the film avoids most attempts at saccharine sentimentality; morover, it flatly rejects spriritual or metaphysical consolations.  If there is any universality to this film, it is the theme that, given that we are all doomed, what induces us to fight our end?

4784323,4,B005LAIIS0,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

In Norse or Viking mythology the wolf took on an almost god-like persona. Despite the premise of The Grey, wolves are generally not dangerous to humans.
Having said that there have been incidents where wolves got used to seeing humans, and would single out certain folks, even able to tell if the human was armed or not. In those cases they usually go for the head or neck area, or an area close to an artery.
The Grey tells a story of survival after a handful of oil-men are stranded from a plane crash in the brutal Alaskan wilderness.
It was supposed to be John Ottway's (Liam Neeson) last day on the job. We find him writing a letter to his wife, telling her that he plans to commit suicide. He's interrupted by the howl of a wolf. He kills the creature. That's his job to keep the predators away from the oil-men.
After the crash, he and a small group of men rush to a forest line, set up camp and build a fire. It's clear the wolves have tracked the men and surrounded them. Hypothermia is setting in. The men share personal thoughts and stories around the fire to keep their minds off the danger. When John gets a turn he recites a poem that he remembers hanging over his Father's desk, ""Once more into the fray, Into the last good fight I'll ever know, Live and die on this day, Live and die on this day.""
One by one the men succumb to the harsh environment, the fierce cold and the deadly wolves.
This is one of the best survival films to come along in awhile.",1338249600,2,1526,4.298611111111111

After waiting a month to see this, and being a fan of survival movies, I finally caught it OnDemand on cable.
In my opinion, it was not worth the wait.

I was very disappointed in the way the movie was depicted. Very vulgar language. To the point where every other word was ""F---"". It definitely took something away from the film for me.

I understand the depressing nature of the film and what the director was trying to do, but when the language is way over the top like that, it stresses nothing. Everything ends up being vanilla. I get it - they're oil workers. OK, let's move on and develop the characters in the story.
When all is said and done, there was over 160 F words. Not necessary to deliver the point.
I could list dozens of other hard edged, intense movies that get the point across with out having to literally insert that much bad language into the script. Almost comical.

I found it week in character development as well. Men running from wolves.
They die one by one. That was it. Other than Liam's character, no other character was well developed. I really didn't feel sorry for any of them.

Half way through the movie I was convinced God made them crash to thin out the gene pool.
I was actually rooting for the wolves. By the time it was over, I wondered why I wasted two hours on a movie I got nothing from. Very hollow.

To Liam's credit, he did a good job acting. But he was surrounded by other poor actors, and a depressing script with little chance of any redeeming features.

The cinematogaphy is bland, the scene sequencing incoherent, the editing amateurish, the story unimaginative.

4784368,4,B005LAIIS0,"I had no idea this film held so many surprises, but rather I enjoyed it immensely moreso for the thought provoking drama, questioning the existence of god and the faith which we devote ourselves to and an appreciation for poetic realism. Liam Neeson leads a cast of  actors in a combination of WOLFEN (1981) attacks meets ALIVE (1993) the plane crash, with maybe a little frozen isolation of THE THING (1982) thrown in. A contracted game hunter named Ottway (Neeson) is hired to protect oilfield workers from predatorial wolves in Alaska, or the Artic. The film begins with Ottway battling his loss of love and unhappiness with himself as he is surrounded by low-lives and drunken misfits. His memories of love making with his woman are effectively weaved into this wasteland and an effective plane crash sequence both, but the real surprises are with the wolf packs that turn the tables on his small group of survivors as they become the prey. I remember seeing WOLFEN, with Albert Finney, when it came out about the lore of indigenous natives as ""shapes-shifters"" getting even with big business for land development and the wolves vision being thermographic, those elements made WOLFEN weak, but the horror factor is there for me as it is in THE GREY.

THE GREY successfully places you in a frozen tundra, as THE THING did, with a feeling of isolation and vulnerability. Yet, as fragile and easy a target these men are, surrounded by beast, not canine or dog like animals, but huge bear sized wolves as one of the fellow survivors, Diaz (Frank Grillo), a fool turned sacrificial lamb, screams at the howling packs after almost losing his life in an attack and yells into the dark, eerie night, ""You're not the animals, we're the animals"" and proceeds to cut a dead omega wolfs head off as the men feast on its carcass, which they intentionally roast and eat for the pack to see from the dark treeline. Ottways attempt in the beginning of the film to end his own misery may well have been the reason his fate gives him the opportunity to choose between being another sacrificial lamb, or the alpha male himself, but not without ""one last fray""? The film deals with each mans mortality and how we choose, or do not choose, to die. One interesting element expressed in the film is how people seem to see their loved ones as death approaches in the form of spirits or memories. I had always thought this to be soley a Native American thing, evidently, its in all cultures. The fight for survival is the films theme whether you be man, or beast and that sometimes, you have to be both in order to win your fight and that like wolves, men are either alpha or omega males.",1338249600,,2667,4.636363636363637

The best thing about this movie, the plane crash event. Without a doubt that was the best crash ever. It was intense. We jumped whenever that plane bumped and were nearly as disoriented, as were the survivors after the crash!

The worst thing about this  movie...everything else! Unfortunately the film should have ended after the crash. Nothing, not even the vastness of the great Alaskan wilderness ever managed to rise to the intensity level of the crash. Why? Nothing else in the entire film makes the slightest bit of sense. They decide to leave the crash site, which is the only thing they have for shelter (and I might add any hope for rescue). No effort to inform possible rescuers that anyone survived the crash (which way did they go George, which way did they go?). Who are these people? What made them such outcast? Why are they so angry? Do they even really want to survive? You never get to know any of them and that's apparently a good thing because no one survives anyway. Why can't you get her back Liam? Is she dead? Did you kill her? Why in god's name didn't you pull the trigger? We don't even get to like the wolves. Early on in the picture Liam's character shots a wolf that had to be near record size? He was better fed than the dog next door. What possible reason would an animal that well fed have to risk exposure to all that civilization? Do wolves trophy hunt?  2 stars for the plane crash.....",1338163200,,1609,4.39261744966443

4784449,2,B005LAIIS0,"I'll make my review brief. It has good cinematography. I liked the bleak, moody atmosphere of the gorgeous British Columbian wilderness (the movie was set in Alaska, shot in British Columbia). I liked the fact that it was a natural horror movie (natural horror is where animals are antagonists, like Jaws or Orca); too many supernatural horror movies. I liked the fact that it was all men. More horror movies need to show all men. The original The Thing did an excellent job of showing a horror movie with only men can be suspenseful and frightening. Too many horror movies rely on pretty blondes just to get the scares going. This movie wasn't as cliched as most horror movies. So I respected it's devotion to being original. In an age where 90% of the movies from Hollywood are remakes, we definitely need original ideas. I'm so exasperated by remakes I'd rather see a flawed original movie than a remake. I also liked the plane crash scene. It actually made me tense.

The flaw: bad characterization. I couldn't feel sorry for anyone in this movie. I couldn't put my finger on it, but the characters seemed like cardboard stock characters than real people. As a result, the movie left me neutral. All in all, I'd recommend renting it. Some people may like this movie. I know many didn't care for it. Just rent it to test the waters if you're curious about this flick. The fans of this movie have been very personal. I've read them arguing with people on imdb.com about this movie for months. I've seen them cursing at the haters and getting cursed at back. That's been the most enjoyable part of this movie. It's good when a movie starts a heated debate. It's especially telling when the debates of the flick are more interesting than the flick itself.

Plus, I had a nitpick about the cold. I don't know where the screenwriter grew up, but apparently the director spent some of his childhood in Michigan and Northern California. So why was his depiction of people in winter so unrealistic? The weather is 0 degrees. Yet most of the time you couldn't see their breath like you would at that temp. They slept without their hats or gloves on and with only one small blanket. If you're in 0 degree weather, you're going to bundle up like mad. And when you're stiff from the freezing cold and hungry, you won't have enough energy to walk to a forest that is a long distance away. Also, I could never get over the fact that the people armed themselves sporadically. They could have made a lot of weapons from the wreckage but didn't. That seems odd. Just like leaving the plan seems odd.",1338163200,2,2595,4.588362068965517

I'm just saying... not the worst movie I've ever seen, but not the best either. I was bordering on ""the Castaway"" with Tom Hanks, thinking this man is going INSANE.  And, of course, we would all like a better ending, but real life doesn't always deal that card.  All I know is that there was some great suspense and some ""ewwwwww"" moments and my heart actually sped up while I watched certain scenes - so much so I had to pause the movie and suck up some nerve to watch the rest.

4784506,2,B005LAIIS0,"A completely unrealistic movie about people jumping off mountains and fighting wild beasts (beasts that have very little resemblance to actual animals here on planet earth). Putting aside how unrealistic this film is (there's enough commentary out there about that) there still isn't even a real story here. Do the characters survive? More importantly, who cares?

I'm surprised this movie gets as many stars as it does here. The absurdity of the film is a major let down. I didn't come in to this expecting an unrealistic alien action flick or something, I was looking for a survival nature film with a plot (and some action). I could forgive a little artistic license but this strays way too far from reality to be forgivable. Wolves don't attack people for fun (they attack for food and they seldom attack humans) and they don't attack prey alone just to ""test"" them. Also people get hypothermia in the conditions these characters were in (especially when they don't create shelters and jump in running rivers) and no one in their right mind is going to leap off a mountain in these conditions (or any conditions for that matter). The crash, coldness, desolation or fear aspects of this film were never properly explored. Even basic survival stuff like creating fires and finding food is skipped over. They actually continued hiking in the dead of night at one point which seemed absurd to me personally. Basically this movie is just ""our plane crashed so um, let's go run around and fight wolves or something"".

The other major let-down in this movie is lack of plot or proper character development. We never really find out in any depth who these people are or what motivates them to survive. The two characters we do get some exploration on are apparently miserable people who have nothing to live for anyway. As the movie goes on you'll ask yourself: will these characters survive? Half way through I concluded that I don't care. I actually ended up rooting for the wolves towards the end.",1338076800,7,1996,4.816326530612245

4784510,4,B005LAIIS0,"Liam Neeson continues his string of action hits with THE GREY.  The story is fairly simple:  8 survivors of a horrifying plane crash in a hostile Alaskan wilderness must face Mother Nature--and a ferocious pack of hungry wolves.  Along the way, there are moments of male bonding and character expositions.
Director Joe Carnahan who assaulted us with the A-TEAM reboot helms the film, which boasts one of the most frightening and realistic plane crashes caught on film.  The film has a brutally beautiful canopy, and lends an air of desperation and loneliness.  Neeson is powerful as usual, a little more vulnerable than in TAKEN or UNKNOWN.  THE GATES' Frank Grillo makes good use of his first big movie role as the blustery macho man whose false bravado masks his true personality--a star-making performance.  Dermot Mulroney eschews his leading man persona in his laidback role and Dallas Roberts brings his usual ""everybody's friend"" image to fuller fruition.  The entire cast is good, but it's basically Neeson and Grillo's movie.

You hardly see more than a furtive glance of what these animals really look like, instead you will come to believe that they are dark as night in bright daylight with dew dripping from the unseen edges of their faces. Really? Their portrayal is a cliche from some weird cross between Little Red Riding Hood and one of the Jason movies. The general stupidity of most of the characters in the movie rings true in terms of my personal experience with many human interactions, so much so that you might find yourself rooting for the shadowy uber beasts. This is a movie to shout at repeatedly since the characters evidence about as much common sense and intellect as you might expect from participants at a wheelchair race on sand. And the movie pretty much slogs along according to that logic. Only in the last 15 minutes of so (not worth the wait) do the characters rise to any recognizable level of humanity and then it's pretty much a catastrophic bust accompanied by whimpers.

Some of the other reviewers seemed impressed by the underlying human struggles or the philosophical questions about life. Fair enough, but these themes are explored with greater depth and in a more rewarding manner in many, many other movies.

4784514,4,B005LAIIS0,"Liam Neeson gives a riveting performance in a dark thriller set in the Alaskan wilderness. When a plane carrying Alaskan pipeline workers crashes in the middle of nowhere, the nine survivors find themselves in a struggle for survival; their plane has crashed in an area where a pack of grey wolves hunt and the seven survivors must face off against a brutal, fierce enemy that has every advantage except one--the human will to survive.

Featuring a terrific supporting cast (Dermot Mulroney, Frank Grillo among others)and a strong script that manages to quickly sketch in the seven characters at the heart of the film.

A bit of a left turn for director Joe Carnahan after the big studio productions he has directed of late (""The A-Team""), ""The Grey"" returns the director to the smaller ensemble based thrillers/dramas he began with--""Narc"" and ""Smokin' Aces"" that help make his reputation- demonstrating that, as good as he is at big Hollywood productions, he's better with smaller, more intimate productions like ""The Grey"".

The Blu-ray is a sharp, nicely detailed transfer. Audio sounds powerful and is VERY active putting you right there in the wilderness with our main characters.

The special features are a bit limited--we get deleted scenes (some extended versions of some in the film) and a great, very frank commentary track from the director with editors Roger Barton and Jason Hellmann. It's a very informative and nicely done commentary track.

Although a bit on the lite side when it comes to the special features what matters is the film itself. Although ""The Grey"" is very much a downbeat film, it's also a powerful film and well worth watching.",1337904000,,1662,5.007246376811594

His performance is amazing and he stays true to character through the entire film. I believe the main focus on the movie is what it truly means to live. Should a human simply live their life day by day confused and unsure or should they take risks and be willing to LIVE their life to make it worth it in the end, when ever that may be. The inner struggle of Neeson's character is very prevalent and he overcomes many obstacles and grows strong mentally as a result.

4784612,3,B005LAIIS0,"For the most part, I enjoyed watching this film once. However, I have a few issues.

For one, Liam Neeson plays a skilled hunter, so why couldn't he have set traps for the wolves? In the wild, traps are a key to catching food and defending your territory from bears and other predators. The entire movie is about a bunch of people scared to death of a bunch of wolves, so they keep running from the wolves until they tire out and die. Not very interesting. They killed one damn wolf throughout the entire film, really? With 8 men, winter or summer, those men should have been having a barbeque every night with an entree of wolves.

Second, I doubt wolves would act like this. There is far easier prey to capture than trying to hunt and kill 7 humans with fire, knives and spears. Full grown humans just aren't on the preferred menu for wolves. Being alone maybe another situation, but 7 people should have survived, maybe not the cold, but certainly the wolves.

Third, I love Liam Neeson's characters in his films. However, it seems that in every movie he has lost someone, whether it be a wife or daughter. In every movie I have watched he loses something which brings about his motivation for the rest of the film (Batman Begins, Seraphim Falls, Taken and so forth). Maybe he likes playing vengeful or pitiful characters, I don't know, but it is getting a little old.

I will continue to watch Liam's films, because he is a good actor. I also love survival movies, so this was on the menu tonight. However, my arguments above leave me placing a three star review for this film.",1337817600,,1581,4.498257839721254

That said, I only watched it because I shelled out twenty bucks for the DVD (thinking, as with other Neeson films, that I would watch it more than once, loan it out to family and friends to save THEM the twenty bucks, etc.)  Wrong. About forty minutes into the film, I was so bored I actually walked away from the screen to a) do laundry, b) wash dishes, and c) balance my checkbook. In-between these tasks, I would glance back at the screen, and darned if the scene looked exactly like every other scene before it -- so I wasn't sure if perhaps the film had accidentally been on ""pause"" all that time...

Of course I MISSED the last 15 seconds of the film while putting the wet laundry into the dryer - and this is crucial - when was the last time you watched a movie (or quasi-watched it like me), and the film didn't actually END?  That is, there was no distinct resolution?  Did he die?  Did the big bad (fake-looking) wolf die?  Was it a draw?  Did they leave the ending unresolved, hoping for a sequel?

His job is to protect the workers from the wildlife that surrounds the plant. While traveling to Anchorage via plane, the almost full aircraft encounters bad weather and temperature so cold that it finally crashes. When he wakes up he finds 7 men capable of moving and the rest are dead or dying.

They believe that their injuries and subzero weather will kill them until the wolves arrive and they realize that they have even more serious problems......

This movie is a good story but it is also very gruesome so be warned. Both the plane crash and the wolf attacks are bloody. The men struggle to survive and face all of the elements that nature can throw at them. The movie is well filmed and the actors do a good job portraying their roles. Liam Neeson is especially good as the group leader take charge type of guy.

For me what detracted from the movie was that these aggressive and intelligent men could not form weapons of any major type. They leave the crashed plane and all of the supplies and potential weapons they could have made from metal to wander into the frigid artic wilderness. This movie was good but it could have been so much more if the men hadn't forgotten everything they could have done more easily.

***Spoilers***
For almost 2 hours, I watched this and at the end, I realized I would've been better off spending that time trying to figure out why water is wet. After crashing and taking refuge in the wreckage where they at least had some sort of cover, they live it behind for a destination unknown and unprotected - THE WOODS. It was kinda obvious someone was always about to die as they were picked off 1 by 1. A couple of the standoff scenes were a bit far-fetched in my eyes. On one side, there are a group of unarmed and unprepared me visibly shaken and on the other side are about 8 sets of wolf eyes and the wolves don't attack. One could only wish that would really happen.

What probably bothered me the most was the end or lack of ending. There's so much time spent showing the other crap but when there's a chance for a big finish and/or action sequence, the credit roll. Are you kidding me? Who wins? If stick around after the credit, there's a post scene that implies Nesson wins. Assuming this is true, what happened after that? Did the other wolves back off? Was Nesson ever rescued? Maybe I want too much that ending was just lackluster at best.",1337558400,2,1295,4.347107438016529

4784797,4,B005LAIIS0,"What's it about?

Liam Neeson has a fly in/ fly out job in the Alaskan wilderness, but on his return home his plane crashes and miraculously survives, along with a number of others onboard. Now they are being hunted by a pack of rabid wolves, and boy, are they relentless. Who knew surviving a plane crash would be the easy part?

Is it any good?

This is the type of movie that could have been very cheesy in less than capable hands, fortunately though this isn't the case. The film is a wonderfully crafted visual film, interspersed with memorable actions scenes, and fantastic character driven performances. Seriously, who doesn't love Liam Neeson? He could make a kids home movie feel intense. Here he lends the film credibility which could have been lost with a completely different cast. The CGI wolves are very well done (i.e. not fake looking), with one scene in particular a stand out, as the gold eyes of the wolves cast down on the survivors in the night. Joe Carnahan is director you can rely on for a quality film, and in this case, he has more than delivered.

Best bit?

Liam Neeson and his buddy try to escape a wolf through a raging river, which will be sure to take your breath away. Yes, pun intended.

While this could be an interesting mix to create a high-brow narrative of daring and clever escape, it doesn't add up to much. There are no real ideas here, the entire film could have been a brilliant 20 minutes of lovely, grim determination, but instead it keeps repeating the same tale: survive the wolves in the cold. That's it. For an hour and a half. The photography, acting, directing -- all are top notch, but the story is just... uneventful, which is a high-brow way of saying boring.",1337472000,2,676,4.786324786324786
4784803,5,B005LAIIS0,Very unique and interesting film. The character development in this is quite surprising. Never expected that for this kind of film. Great performances all around!,1337472000,6,162,5.52
4785054,3,B005LAIIS0,"The basic problem of The Grey is the difference between what the filmmakers think they had and what the marketing department wanted to sell. This is promoted as a dramatic survival action movie in the trailers and even Liam Neeson's talk-show circuit tour pushed the same line - a plane crashes and a bunch of guys have to survive things that want to eat them. Kind of 'Alive' meets Jurassic Park. With Ra's al Ghul.

Unfortunately, it's this difference that's going to disappoint most of the audience. The film starts with Liam's melancholic voice-over (which isn't a good sign) and a fairly dim setup of oil-riggers beating the ever-loving out of each other. We then see Liam shooting a wolf, lamenting the loss of his wife and then putting a rifle in his mouth and contemplating sparing us from another 2 hours of this. And it gets more depressing from there when the trip home ends abruptly in a plane crash.

It's at this point that the film's indecision about what it is becomes a real problem. As an action or survival film, Liam guides his band of survivors in the most irresponsible way possible, making mistake after mistake and fundamentally dooming them all to becoming wolf entree. There are some basic errors, such as a stack of shotgun shells packed with his rifle, and anybody who's familiar with wolf behavior is going to be really unhappy at their depiction in this film. Anyone from Alaska is going to be even more unhappy at the depiction of swimming in rapids too.

Also as an action film, the wolves have a supernatural capability to outsmart the survivors and behave more like Spielberg's raptors than any real life wolf. At one point they jump a ravine and the wolfs are waiting with GPS precision. They pick off our band of survivors one at a time, leaving us with intermittent testosterone-fueled in-fighting to pass as drama. If only Liam hadn't left the crash site, where rescue teams would already have arrived with burgers and cocoa.

But here's the problem - it's not an action film. It's not a survival film either. It's a psychological drama about facing death where the wolves act as furry metaphors for the grim reaper. From the very first scene to the last, Liam Neeson (who's very good as always) emphasizes this theme and it reverberates over and over. And that's where the film could have been quite good and a welcome break from the survival genre but unfortunately it's too late by the time it becomes clear that the wolves' uncanny supernatural sense has a very good explanation.

My guess is that the everyone expecting an action drama is going to be very unhappy, along with animal rights, PETA, Alaskans and oil-riggers. It's a real shame they didn't recut the trailer before the release.",1337472000,148,2733,4.733193277310924
4785055,4,B005LAIIS0,"What made me post is that many of the reviews seem to focus on the WOLF aspect of the movie.  For me, the movie was about something else.  Not until the end, did I decide that the movie was mostly about coping with death.  Knowing that death is imminent and exploring different reactions.
My wife is an M.D. and had to do a rotation on an oncology ward and she gave me some perspectives on this.  And actually, I'm not sure it is 100% but it could be, that in the movie, the protagonist's SO [significant other] (wife, girfriend) ""leaves him"" by dying of cancer.  I am sure that we are supposed to think she died of some medical issue.  And this was not clear until near the end.  Before that he says ""you left me"" but maybe we could think she just broke up with him.
So, ultimately we know that she struggled with death - and she probably knew that it was an impossible struggle.  She tells him not to be afraid.  Perhaps when she said the words she meant - he should not be afraid of her death - but at the end of the movie - we think she means he should not be afraid of his own death.
Throughout the movie, the protagonist is portrayed as being more comfortable with death than most of those around him.  He might have made a good oncology nurse!  He is shown perhaps comforting the wolf that he just shot - giving us the impression that he is perhaps grieving for the wolf.  He also comforts a mortally wounded survivor after the plane crash, telling him that he will die and asking him to think of someone he loves (his daughter) in his final moments.  These actions also have the side affect of calming the other survivors.
And finally at the end, we are given the impression that the protagonist knows he will met his death, but does not try to run away.
There are variously recognized stages of grief:  Denial, Anger, Barganing, Depression, Acceptance and we certainly see all of these portraied by the various humans in the movie.  But for me the primary theme is the struggle through these stages against an impossible situation in which death is certain.  The parallel between the protagonist's SO and the protagonist himself reinforces this theme.

This movie cannot be very popular, because while it contains one of the Freudian requirements (violence) it does not contain the other (Sex).  There are no short skirts or high heels in this movie!

And this movie reminds me a bit of another movie that was not popular, Thin Red Line.  In that movie the protagonist's mother dies of a medical issue and he thus becomes more familiar with death and the stages of grief.  On Guadalcanal he faces death with more acceptance than most of his compatriots.  Woody Harelson for instance dies cursing his own stupidity.  The protagonist accepts his death with perhaps a bit too much ease, but the movie makes its point - and the point is (for me at least) the same point made in THE GREY.  That some of us can move through the stages of grief to the end (acceptance), while others cannot.

Liam Neeson does an excellent job as always and even though the viewer doesn't get to really know the characters that doesn't seem to be the objective of this movie.

So I really wanted to like this move.  I should have read the reviews.  The plot was a little thin and the ending sucked.  I hate that kind of ending.  It could have been so much more.

SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT.  I really hate the ""live sucks and then you die"" movies.  They had me right up until the ending.  I know ""you can imagine any ending you want argument"".  In my opinion those are just an trick when the writer is stuck or lazy.  As with all of these this is my opinion and I am no movie critic.  I just know what I like.  FYI I am over 40 and I have seen a ton of movies.  I am a movie nut so I am a bit jaded I want a plot and good acting.  I like action but not without a plot and acting to go with it.  This had good acting considering what they had to work with.",1337212800,2,1184,3.7510204081632654
4785383,4,B005LAIIS0,"I'm truly surprised to see so many bad reviews of this here. I for one was surprised by how solid it was, specifically because of Neeson's typically excellent performance. In fact, it's one of his best roles. Add that to a great score and tight direction and this is a chilling tale in every way.

It's tough not to give spoilers for this one, so, short and sweet: it's occasionally very violent but it's always real violence, mostly wolf on man, and I'll take that any day over the numbing one hero shoots a hundred bad guys crap we usually get. This is much scarier, as it's believable. And it felt all too real at many moments, and that ever-present threat of (all-natural!) carnage adds a lot of suspense.

The Grey has two classic scenes to boot: one of the best/worst plane crashes on film, and a truly fine death scene that transcends almost all other cinematic deaths. Perhaps it's those two scenes that turned folks off: they make us face a couple of very common fears, but not in an exploitative, fake way. That makes them all the more real and edgy.

Neeson makes them work, as he does the whole film. The guy can act, and never does he feel like he's in a film. He carries it all, and this is one of the best acting jobs I've ever seen in a film like this. It starts out as man vs. man, then man vs nature, and finally it's man vs. himself. That's all of the dramatic basics wrapped up in one, and it works.

The blu-ray is a good transfer, but features only deleted scenes, all rightfully so, and a commentary. BUT...the commentary features the director and two editors drinking scotch throughout, and as they get sauced they start getting more honest, which you almost never hear on these. Carnahan even goes so far as to say that he thinks the film didn't deserve to have been a box office number one, which is a wild thing to say about your own film. But the commentary is well worth checking out for just such moments; it's one of a kind. (I sure would love to have heard Hitchcock or Kurosawa discussing their films while knocking back a few!)

All in all, if you like a good raw survival film, then this is your meat. So to speak...",1337212800,,2151,4.3541147132169575
4785444,4,B005LAIIS0,"The presence of Liam Neeson is main reason that I wanted to see The Grey. I've become an even bigger fan since I bought Taken and saw that he could even bring depth to a character in an action movie. Neeson seems authentic in just about any role, even if he's just providing the voice for an animated character.

In The Grey, Neeson is clearly the main character. We see him contemplate suicide at the start of the movie, before deciding against it. The story involves a group of oil workers stationed in Alaska. Ottway (Neeson) is a marksman who keeps the workers safe from wolves when they are at work. He carries a rifle and is always watching for possible attacks. He has a low opinion of most of the workers and doesn't enjoy having to spend time with them.

Ottway's world changes when he's involved in a plane crash. The oil workers encounter bad weather and turbulence, and the resulting crash leaves most of the group dead or dying. It's here that Ottway assumes a leadership role without being asked or voted in. Like the wolves he kills, his instincts cannot be denied. In the surviving group, it quickly becomes clear that he's the alpha. Ottway has a way of facing facts and helping others to accept the inevitable. This is perfectly illustrated when one of the crash victims dies in front of him. Ottway calms him and takes charge of the situation when the other men are incapable of deciding how to handle it.

The movie partly reminded me of The Edge, starring Anthony Hopkins. Although this group of survivors is larger, and they are hunted by wolves instead of a bear, the terrain is similar. The Grey seems realistic and doesn't idealize the situation in any way. The men are in danger and fighting for their lives, and their actions are plausible. If you are facing a pack of wolves unarmed, your chances of survival are not good. The Grey doesn't shy away from that fact.

Action scenes are infrequent, but have considerable impact. How would you try to survive if you had no food or shelter and had to make your way through freezing snow? Would it be best to try to make your own way back to civilization, or stay at the crash site and hope for rescue?

The movie explores the characters of several of the crash survivors and we come to understand their individual choices. The setting is grim, so don't expect a heartwarming story. This is real.

I didn't know what to expect from The Grey, but it left me somewhat surprised. The body count was definitely higher than expected, and I assumed that the group would generate more internal conflict than it did. That said, I did feel as though I was a part of the quest for survival and I was engaged at all times. Neeson carried the movie, but three or four supporting characters were important to the story.

If you enjoy experiencing things that you are unlikely to witness in your real life, The Grey is a compelling story which transports you to an unfamiliar setting. If you are sensitive to watching characters get picked off one at a time, it might not be for you.

The Blu-ray offers a pleasing presentation. The audio is just about perfect, and you'll feel involved in scenes such as the plane crash. The picture quality is also very good, but sometimes appears intentionally grainy to heighten the effect of being lost in a bleak, snowy wilderness.",1337212800,3,3328,4.572147651006712
4785445,3,B005LAIIS0,"Generally, I love any movie with survival against the odds as a theme and that goes double for any movie starring Liam Neeson. On the good side, this is a gripping, even wrenching story of a plane crash in the vast wilderness of Alaska and the attempts by the survivors to keep alive after the crash. Not too bad for the setting of the scene, the plane crash itself (though a whole lot more drawn out than in real life, which would be milliseconds, not the minute or so it takes on screen). The settings are excellent and you can almost feel the cold and the shock as the survivors take stock and first realize that their struggle has entered into a new phase, thanks to the entry of a lot of particularly ferocious and aggressive wolves. At this point, the Liam Neeson character takes charge and the living and remarkably uninjured crash survivors follow him on a trek into the wilderness for survival. Or not.

Not a good move. If you are unfortunate enough to be in a plane crash in a remote area but fortunate enough to survive and there is enough remaining wreckage available, stay with the wreck! That's what people will be searching for, it will shelter you somewhat from the elements and if you have the particularly bad luck to land in the middle of carnivores as these people did, the wreckage makes a dandy fortress with a little adjustment. You would need food and fuel for fires and certainly any efforts to enhance visibilty for searchers would be useful but moving further into the wilderness would be, well, fatally stupid. Cannot fathom why the writers had Liam rejecting the rifle because it had a broken stock - it could still have been fired, a nice thing if wolves are an issue (was he worried about its resale value?) or why they never thought of the usefulness of the metal in the wreckage for spearpoints or to fabricate bows/arrows for close-in defense. They never seemed notice that they would be traveling over deep snow, so nobody tried to make snowshoes or skiis or even a sledge for dragging gear. Despite the characters' rough-and-ready image, they never seemed to figure out what conditions they would have to deal with and overcome them. In the end, all they did was give the wolves a bit more fun while wearing all of the humans out.

I would guess that the point of the movie really was the futility of fate and maybe to be more selective of which leader to follow when you find yourself in extremis.. Even Liam Neeson can be completely wrong.

Besides Liam Neeson's awesome voice (think back to Taken), there's nothing worth seeing/hearing here.",1337212800,7,291,4.8
4785448,3,B005LAIIS0,"This movie comes within a hair's breadth of a two star rating; only Liam Neeson's work as Ottway pulls it out.  There's so much wrong here it's hard to not to make a laundry list.

As a reviewer elsewhere noted, this movie is a sort of meditation on death and God.  As these big wolves kill again and again (and get killed themselves in a couple of instances), the despair of the men grows as does anger against God for allowing this carnage.  Ottway collects the wallets of the dead, and it becomes clear to the movie viewer that these rough, profane men at the edge of the world are nonetheless linked to civilization through their families.  Their wives' and childrens' pictures are in those wallets, save for troublemaker Diaz's.  In its own way this movie is almost religious about serious matters of life, God, family, death, things we hang on to or think about ultimately.

But oy veh.  A troubled Ottway, wolf-killer hired by the oil company to protect its workers, early on sets out to kill himself.  He sticks his rifle's barrel into his mouth but is distracted at the last moment.  But this is northern Alaska in bitterly cold weather: why didn't his mouth freeze to the gun barrel like a kid's tongue to a flag pole?  Stranger yet, his ammo is shown to be shotgun shells, which feature before the ill-fated airplane flight and during the desperate fight against the wolves after the crash.  But he has a rifle, not a shotgun!  (In passing, his rifle was aboard the aircraft but destroyed in the crash.)  Speaking of shotgun shells, Ottway rigs them up to spears made of saplings to go off when rammed against a wolf.  Truth is, without a barrel to channel the explosive gases, the worst the shell would do is sting the wolf, not kill it.  (Such testing of shells and cartridges shows that they barely penetrate nearby cardboard when ignited in the open.)

Still, the device is successfully used once, and then all those sharp spears and shells the other men had mysteriously vanish.  Absolutely senseless movie-making.

Now, an airliner crash would have dozens of families alerted, aircraft everywhere searching for the wreck and survivors, and oil company searchers on the loose.  Yet somehow the crash survivors convince themselves that no one will come looking, or care, or if one does he'd never find them, despite the massive wreckage being right out in the open in a huge clearing.  I know that without this conceit there wouldn't be a movie at all, but there must be another way to strand them without comical assumptions that the world wouldn't even bother looking for them.

Other Amazon reviewers note this, so let me just add my agreement: How dumb can you be to leave the plane wreckage behind, which is shelter, clothing, fuel, and at least some food and drink not to mention a huge landmark for searchers to see, to set out across a shelterless plain toward a shelterless tree line with proven killer wolves around?  In this instance a pretty good movie could have been made about these men improvising a defense in the plane's remains against these wolves, it seems to me.

For as cold as it was supposed to be, there was a frequent lack of vapor from breathing, much like in the better movie ""The Edge.""  From personal experience I can assure the reader that temperatures that cold would not have you lounging around a small campfire with your gloves off or sleeping comfortably under one blanket.

For those who care, the F bomb is used a couple of hundred times in the movie as noun, verb, present participle, intensifier, adjective, adverb, interjection, and all-purpose space filler.  Even these days most people don't talk like that.  It's time for moviemakers to be a little more creative in their oaths.  How about, say, ""cursed Satan spawn"" or ""damnable colon-formed wolves""?

Well.  You'll have to decide for yourself if the ending was satisfactory.  The ""neat resolutionist"" in me didn't care much for it, but it does fit in well with the general ambiguity of the movie, nothing being certain but death and taxes.  Or is there something else beyond those?  Are those figures who come for or comfort their dying men just hallucinations, or something more divine?",1337212800,37,4199,4.738292011019284

4785451,1,B005LAIIS0,"After surviving a plane crash in a remote area of Alaska, a group of oil drillers face a pack of wolves that kill for the fun of it.

CONS... Too many scenes were filmed in the pitch dark, with only a campfire to light the actor's faces. The camera jerked and panned this way and that, making it even more difficult to see what was happening. The wolves, which are less frightful than Cabbage Patch dolls, stayed away long enough for the group of men to have long and excruciating conversations that did little more than extend the length of this film. Even Liam Neeson couldn't save it. In an attempt to make the wolves look scarier, lots of night scenes were shot to capture their eyes glowing in the background. There's lots of soundtracks of many, many wolves howling in the background too. Oh, big scary moments there!

Oddly, this movie has some entertainment value. It's loaded with hysterically stupid stuff. I laughed in many places I shouldn't have. One such scene involved the killing of a wolf. The starving group roasted the carcass, head and all, over a campfire for several hours, until it was cooked enough to eat. One member of the group decided to upset the remaining pack that howled in the darkness. He stabbed and chopped off the roasted wolf's head with his knife, while its blood dripped all over his head. Nice grisly effect, I suppose, except that the wolf was thoroughly cooked. There shouldn't have been a drop of blood left in it.

Another scene found Neeson swept away in the rapidly flowing, brutally cold glacial waters. He managed to pull himself to shore, drenched to the skin. He sat down in a snowbank to rest a while. After cursing God, he gets up and continues his hike. In reality, he would have frozen to death seconds after getting out of the ice water.

While out-running the wolves, the group suddenly stops short at the edge of a cliff. It's hundreds of feet straight down to the ground, and hundreds of feet across to the other side. They make a rope, tie one end to a tree and the other end to one of the oil drillers, who, after getting a running start, jumps across the expanse of the deep ravine. He lands in the trees and secures his end of the rope to a strong tree. The rope provided a ""bridge"" from the edge of the cliff to the other side of the mountain. And if that wasn't outrageous enough, the same pack of wolves immediately attacks them after they shimmy across the bridge to the other side. WTH? How did the wolves get over there?

One oil driller, knowing the campfire was the only thing keeping the pack of wolves at bay, left the fire and wandered into the darkness to take a whiz. He never made it back to camp.

There are tons of outrageous moments in The Grey. I couldn't even begin to list them all.

The ending infuriated me. The wolves waited patiently on the sidelines while Neeson paid a finale tribute to the photographs, but I guess I should have seen that nonsense coming.

PROS... None, unless you count my relief that I didn't spend ten bucks to see this movie in the theater.

4785452,5,B005LAIIS0,"I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I'm no stranger to cinema. Blue Velvet, HEAT, Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, The Big Lebowski, Once Upon A Time In The West- all classics in my book. So when I heard some generally negative reviews about The Grey, I couldn't understand why, considering how much I loved it ( I would periodically think about it days after seeing it in the theatre) I attest this to my love of 'manly man' survival movies such as The Edge, Deliverance, 127 Hours, and Alive- all of which have elements in The Grey. The horrified expressions of the men when they realize that nature has no pity, no feelings is reminiscent of  John Boorman's Deliverance, and the event depicted in Alive is referenced in the movie jokingly.
  The Grey, however, succeeds in creating it's own unique vibe. One of Life and Death, and 'the grey' area in-between, when friends can die in an instant, memento mori at it's purest. This movie is introspective, as the viewer experiences this man, who somehow finds the will to live after losing so much, truly sees what is important, can be reflected on ourselves and our lives. Although there is a certain machismo among the other men early on, this gives way to surprisingly effective personal viewpoints givin in bits as the men rest between wolf assaults. This changes The Grey from a gritty realistic survival film, to a film that functions on a mythical level to explore the meaning of life, the existence of God and the introspective nature of humanity. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the alpha-male leader of the group,standing against the viciousness of nature. He really is the pure, distilled essence of man, and still a complete badass considering he just turned 60!
  As for the ambiguous ending, those that didn't like the film's poetic conclusion missed the true, introspective intent of the film entirely. I don't want to ruin anything, but when when a movie centered on living and dying, the significance of life to us, wouldn't it be fit to leave it to the individual to decide Ottoway's fate?

That poem comes from THE GREY, the new adventure film starring Liam Neeson and reteaming him with his A-Team director Joe Carnahan, and in it's this statement of glory and sacrifice that lies the secret to why this movie works so well. Not told as a violent potboiler, as we have so often come to expect, that I dare say we accept, this is a story driven by characters with personalities and back stories, all driven in their quest to survive and helping their fellow survivors. This isn't just an action spectacle, it is an adventure and as such, it is a movie to cherish.

The film, as you probably already know, takes place in Alaska and follows the plight of 8 men who survive an airplane crash. Armed with little more than the clothes on their backs, they must rely on one another as they seek refuge. Coming at them are not just the elements that could easily kill a man, but also a pack of angry wolves, who feel that their habitat has been violated and their for, they must destroy the invaders.

Carnahan is a good director, with the exception of his underrated 2002 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Narc/dp/B00008YJDK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Narc</a>, he hasn't up to this point shown himself to be much more than a technician, however. On THE GREY, he finally delivers on the promise of his earlier film, working from a script co-written by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, based on Jeffer's story, this is riveting storytelling of the first order. Enhanced thanks to expert cinematography from Masanobu Takayanagi. Neeson is at his best in years, finally stepping away from the generic action pics that have started to define him. Also their is fine supporting work from Dallas Roberts and Dermot Mulrooney, among others.

If you come at this expecting the story about wolves to be ""real"" wolves, you'd probably hate it.  But the wolves are obvious symbols of death.

It was a very emotional movie, starting with a near suicide - prevented by the howl of a wolf... and then the accident.  To me it was a story of the wolves saving the men - ironically by ""taking them"" - similar to Jacob's LAdder's reference to ""Demon's appear as demons taking our attachments from us.""  In one killing we see how the wolf really is a man's dead daughter, who appears to him, but the others see it as a viscious wolf taking his life.

I saw the movie as the men were already dead... and the wolves were symbols of the last step to cross over.  It's scary. It's terrifying.  But that's only the fear of loss.  There is really rest, and it's the loved ones who are coming to take the individuals through the process... which is why the main character of Liam is taken by the Alpha wolf... and none of the others.  Possibly his wife, or father, come to help him move over.

He just couldn't see it... so he saw the wolves as icons of the end, of enemies.

The wolves wanted him to learn to live life, and face death fighting (not giving up) - just like the poem he often quoted throughout the movie... which is why they stopped the suicide... and yet, they brought him to the end.",1337126400,6,1347,4.25984251968504
4785566,4,B005LAIIS0,"Liam Neeson's determined performance - one of his best - anchors THE GREY, one of this year's more memorable cinematic excursions to date. Viewers who might've missed director Joe Carnahan's film in theaters ought to check out the picture on video.

Carnahan, who adapted a book by Ian McKenzie Jeffers with the author, has fashioned a gripping account of a disparate group of Alaskan oil drillers who crash in the frozen wilderness and are subsequently attacked by a pack of hungry wolves. It's essentially a frigid ""Deliverance"" but with some poetic passages as Neeson and his fellow survivors dig themselves out and try to stay alive, occasionally stopping to deliberate on the meaning of life, the existence of God and why in the world these starving hunters won't give them a break.

Atmospherically shot in British Columbia and filled with memorable set-pieces, ""The Grey"" is exciting and well-executed on nearly every front, save for some occasionally spotty uses of CGI. Still, Neeson's gritty performance says it all: his John Ottway might have been dealt a few bad hands, but the character opts to go down fighting, and the film's spirituality adds depth to a picture that, even on just a pure surface level, ranks as one of the more compelling outdoor-adventure yarns in recent memory.

Universal's Blu-Ray looks terrific with its 1080p transfer and sounds even better with a marvelously mixed DTS MA soundtrack layered with surround activity.

The movie was pretty formulaic from start to finish and the actions of the wolves seemed a bit exaggerated to me, not realistic, which took away from the film.  The way each person gets picked off one by one and all of them had or acquired injuries that made them easy kills, it was just too cliche in my opinion.  The movie should've been called ""Bad luck strikes repeatedly, then wolves attack.""  It's basically a horror movie in the snow.  You can't even get away from the cheap scare cliche with this movie.

Other items that just made it worse...  When you spend 5-10 minutes in freezing water, you're dead.  Instead of immediately building a fire when he got out of the water, Ottway just sat down.  In the next scene he's dry.  The watch with the beacon only seemed to beep when it was given attention by a character (I can't stand the momentary beeping timer/countdown/beacon cliche, it drives me insane).

The man can do anything: travel halfway across the world to rescue his daughter; train a Jedi master, a Sith lord, AND Batman; even lead a Scottish revolution.  What, you may be thinking, could a plane crash possibly do to Mr. Neeson?  Ruffle his hair?

Indeed, Neeson and his fellow actors walk away from the plane crash...into the jaws of some very hungry, very demonic wolves.  Sound improbable?  It is.  And that's part of the fun.  Because THE GREY isn't an action film.  It was marketed as such, and as you can judge from many of the reviews, this was the viewpoint a lot of people took when watching it.  But THE GREY is more of an existential survivalist film.  These wolves aren't really wolves--they don't look like wolves, they don't behave like wolves.  The plane crash, beautiful though it is on film, isn't very realistic.  The fact that Neeson's character just happens to be a man paid to kill wolves?  Yeah.

But Joe Carnahan does what most filmmakers wouldn't dare: he uses the absurdity to tell a bigger, more meaningful story.  Years from now, when people are debating whether or not Carnahan is a good filmmaker, the ""pro"" side will put forth THE GREY as their proof.  It is beautifully shot--the wolves are achingly rendered, shadowy creatures whose minimal appearance reflects the overall ambiguity of the film.  (Their attacks are effectively brutal while presenting a minimum level of gore.)  The afore-mentioned crash is stunning, and the various small action sequences are tightly drawn.  This is truly a film to be watched--the special effects, combined with the cinematography, and the actors' rugged appearances, makes it hard for one's eyes to wander.

THE GREY isn't without its flaws.  It's slow in spots, and has a few weaker moments--hence the 4 stars.  But when it hits, it hits true, making it that rare film that defies expectations, bends genre conventions, and becomes something truly different.  An accidental hit, you might like to call it--or possibly the proof that there is a great filmmaker lurking within Joe Carnahan's imagination.",1337040000,2,2182,4.9150684931506845

4785637,5,B005LAIIS0,"This movie is one of the best action thrillers I have ever seen. In fact, I could hardly stand the suspense in parts and I am a big-time action movie enthusiast.  FIVE STARS and then some.

I love wolves, especially in the frozen north.  They have a primitive nobility that we have lost and yearn to regain.  Theirs is an eerie beauty, an uncompromising savagery... yet they adhere to a social order that we would do well to emulate.  Wolves mate for life, take good care of their young, kill only for food and wolves never lie.

In this movie, their being portrayed as these larger-than-life, blood-thirsty, jaw-snapping,  menacing shadows,  operating on a strange tribal code understood only by Neeson, made it all the more delicious.

The scenes where they appear at the edge of the darkness, one by one,  surrounding the men, one set of glowing  eyes emerging, then another and another, was the stuff of nightmares.

Other times, it was the very sight of a grey, ghostly sillhouette, silently loping thru the trees. Or it was  simply that single branch, breaking off camera, that signaled armegeddon about to rain down.

I have read criticisms indicating that the wolves looked too annimatronic and fake, but I totally disagree.  If they would have used shots of, say,  a regular wolf from Yellowstone, for example,that wolf would have lacked the hellish monster vibe that these wolves gave you.  And the way they filmed them, flickering in and out of the snow, trees, campfires, with only the occasional full-on show-down, gave  them a satanic poetry that they would not have had otherwise.

Liam Neeson is the only man who could have done this role, if I only had the current crop of stars to pick from.  And he did an Oscar-winning job, although these kinds of movies, sadly, hardly ever make it to the red carpet.  I think, that in history, the only other star I could see doing this would be Tommy Lee Jones, who would have been, I think, equally as good.

Other movies promise to have you on the edge of your seat--this one actually accomplishes that !

The only weird glitch and I hope that they correct this if they publish any more DVD's of this, is that the REAL ending doesn't play until after all the credits have played ( who hangs around for end-credits???? ) Initially, you are left with a cryptic, albeit profoundly stunning ending that leaves you puzzled.

THEN, today, after reading some critical reviews, I realized that I had to FAST FOWARD to the END of the CREDITS to get that last 20 second shot, that tells you what actually happens. I have no idea why they did it this way, and I feel that it was an epic mis-step...after going back and seeing the REAL ending today, I am left with more of a sense of resolution on the movie.",1337040000,5,2754,4.596311475409836

The writers could have and should have explored the father and son connection just a bit more and earlier in my humble opinion. This would have made that bond deeper creating more meaning and developed that premise ""Once more into the fray, into the last good fight I'll ever know."" It works in the end though just a thought.
  Character building was minimal but it worked. The wolves were somewhat predictable but still scary. They had an air of CG (or lack of reality) that was touching the envelop of believability. I know it's a movie but it is supposed to draw you in and take you there, not kick you out every so often. This movie does hold you there. The weather does seem unbelievably cold and real. The thought of surviving that wreck, hiking through the snow, chased by wolves, whoa. The scene after the wreck and the man dying from a cut artery was profound, one of the best in the movie. I liked the banter back and fourth between the men. Shows reality and the hierarchy of that Pack. Yes these men were their own wolf pack Neeson being the Alpha male.

*Semi-spoiler Alert!*
It doesn't turn out that way. Rather, the human survivors of the plane crash (led by Neeson's character), in a cruel twist of fate, are slowly picked off by the wolves as they try to make their way back to civilization. In fact, there is really only one scene where the humans are able to retaliate and kick some wolf butt. Otherwise, the humans slowly succumb to both the wolves and harsh winter climate. So the movie is rather depressing if you watch it thinking you are going to see an awesome display of the human will to survive against all odds. Instead of giving you the idea that ""surviving against all odds is really likely"", there are other points the movie tries to make...one in particular seems to be that if you're in a lot of trouble don't expect a miracle from God to get you out of it, because it isn't happening in this flick...you're on your own.

A job at the end of the world. Stuck in the bleak arctic, Ottway (Liam Neeson) is a sniper hired by an oil crew to protect them against the worst nature has. With his dark past very present in his mind, he boards a company airplane home with an oil crew as uncivilized as the landscape. After a random storm, the plane crashes in a frozen hell of ravenous wolves and unforgiving conditions. With only wits and ebbing resources, Ottway realizes they are being stalked by a pack of wolves. And it becomes a race between species to out-fight the other as the cold blizzard brings most certain death.

And it is not just man against nature. It is man versus death.

As the opening voice over narrates the futility of a life devoid of meaning, Ottway is preparing to commit suicide. With his heart broken and his spirit in pieces, The Grey begins where most stories about redemption end. Neeson, with his gravelly voice and sunken eyes, is the last candidate I expected to find in this story, touted as ""Taken"" with wolves. As advertised, The Grey was touted as Liam Neeson kicking ass and making slippers out of the remains of wolf.

Instead, we get a soulful and complex figure haunted by the demons of the past, as well as the specter of death, and Neeson transcends his own acting action film persona to give us a character who is both fragile and strong. A man who bleeds and begs of the Divine to save him. The scene that involves Neeson literally screaming and cursing the Divine is both chilling in it's realism and horrifying when we realize that he might actually be right. The scene is so profound when one thinks about the personal background of Neeson, who lost his wife several years before.

When taken in that way, the scene that has now become inescapably haunting in my mind is all the more visceral and real. I wasn't certain it was Ottway who was screaming at the Divine, but Neeson. Though, I've heard that Neeson is a Roman Catholic, even the best of us find it crushing to even consider the hand of the Divine in the midst of unspeakable tragedy.

Indeed, death gets quite a bit of screen time, both in conversation and action, with the wolves manipulating the group, and the fights are sparse but vicious and brutal. But that is not the point of the story, and director Joe Carnahan (The A-Team) doesn't dwell on the gore, only using it to point to the wider philosophical spectrum. The musical score is sparse, and allows the film to set it's own pace, which allows for the silences to speak louder about the characters. There are scenes of graphic violence involving people's in a state of shock being ripped apart, but the images are often beautiful in their transcendent power. The violence is not the point.

Death, and how we deal with it, is the point. It is cold, calculating, and inescapable. Like God's judgment, there is nothing we can do to be free of it's curse. At least, for now.

I sat on my couch for three hours last night, pondering the philosophical concepts of The Grey. I didn't remember the blood, the jump scenes, the scenery, the music or the acting; though all of that is outstanding. But, The Grey is not about the wolves, or even about Liam Neeson. It is first and foremost a story about God, and where He is when suffering bares it's fangs. The film is not necessarily interested in answering the provocative questions it presents, nor should it, but it presents them in the midst of transcendent emotion and complex spirituality.

The ending is akin to The Sopranos, and it will divide audiences. I personally felt it ended on a pitch-perfect note, both ambiguous and gripping. It allows it's themes to fully remain intact without succumbing to cliche, and frankly, it is refreshing to see a film end a film on it's own terms, rather than on the expectations of it's audience.

The twist that is revealed will not rock your world, but the climactic build up to it had tears in my eyes. It forces us to look beyond the present state of chaos and focus on what gives life meaning. And does that meaning involving more than an instinct for survival?

Once more into the fray
Into the last good fight I'll ever know
Live and die on this day
Live and die on this day

Come for the wolves, stay for the rest. It will give you far more meaning for your dollar.

I knew The Grey was going to be bad when (SPOILER ALERT) Liam Neeson, in the first fifteen seconds says, ""a summary killer,"" in describing what he does. I barely could pick up what he said, but there it was, yup, ""summary killer."" IMHO, one does not begin ones' movie with a difficult word like ""summary killer,"" within the first fifteen seconds. It's like WTF? WTF is a summary killer? Having a lit degree, yah, I know what it means. But mr. average movieguy? He turns to his girlfriend and says- ""what did he just say?"" She doesn't want to answer him, cuz she's busy trying to figure out WTF he just said and it goes on from there.
Next, there's a delicious shot of ol' brother Liam lining up on a grey wolf that (SPOILER ALERT DELUXE) that just happens to beeline out of the forest, yup, I mean that sincerely, runs, straight out of concealing woods toward three men standing around an oil or gas pipeline. GOOD THING ol' Liam was there, READY, to dust that evil toad, his mean, lean killing machine hefted at his shoulder. And he does what must be done. Cuz, he knew, that Grey was gonna BEELINE out of the woods, spring over one hundred and fifty feet of open field and attack three grown MALE OIL PIPELINE WORKERS because, well, because he was houngry... But lucky ol' Liam was there, to save the pipeline workers.
I guess the film deserves one star, because, as I watched it, I realized I had chores to do and, because of the depressing tone of this movie, I realized I had better get them done before some wolf did me in.

4785753,5,B005LAIIS0,"Countless philosophers and religions have tried to answer that by actually giving us a set of commandments, rules or viewpoints to actually give meaning to something we simply do not have a straight answer for. In the end, the meaning of life is the meaning we ourselves give to it.
The Grey is all about this, had the writer director for this move have been a fan of normal Hollywood movies with a lollipops for everybody and a happy endings this probably would never have made, and that would have been such a shame.
The basic premise of the movie is pretty simple; a plane crashes in the middle of Alaska and a group of survivors try to make their way into civilization while being hunted by the local wolves.  I could talk about the magnificent photography, the brilliant casting of Liam Neason or the stark beauty of the Alaskan landscape, but instead I will focus on what becomes the central point of this movie; when everything seems to be against you, what is it that truly matters to us, what makes us tick and in the end when everything seems to be done, what comfort do we get out of it?
The answer is as varied as the characters of the movie itself, and in a sense some have that quite moment of reflection take away from them by the circumstances, and some others simply have the moment come upon then after everything else seems to be exhausted.
Rarely have I watched a movie and felt this weight upon me, because we might dodge the issue and try to justify the way we have lived and the things we have done, but it is with movies like these that we feel a creeping feeling that we might have take our time for granted or numbed ourselves in our petty little lives surrounded by our petty little machines and toys...but in the end we face the reality of the meaning of our lives...and we might find it lacking, or surprisingly fulfilling ...

Liam Neeson as usual was intense and is a pleasure to watch generally.  Unfortunately, as many reviewers have noted, there are some glaring inconsistencies and not quite believeable situations that kept me distracted from the story line. These seemly minor incongruities do make a difference.  The movie had promise and I felt could have been a lot better without them. First of all, I was amazed, as has been mentioned in a prior review, that after double belting himself across his seat, Neeson wakes up laying in the snow quite a distance from the wreckage? And apparently uninjured!  He hasn't a scrath on him, but when he finds his rifle, still in its case, it is apparently broken and unsuable?  It is mentioned in the movie that they hit the ground going 400 mph. Now this may have been a guess on the speaker's part, but for only several of them to survive suggests quite a crash, and then these survivors were walking without so much as a limp or broken limb (except one other who dies shortly after the crash due to bleeding)? Then there is the letter, which he apparently put in his pocket before the crash, and then finds it near the seat he occupied previously, after the crash? And where were the cell phones?  I assumed the movie was contemporary. Maybe that far out in Alaska there would be no signal.  But these men didn't really know how far they flew before the crash.  Not a single one pulls out a phone to see if there was signal? Did I miss something? And the wind chill factor. Would they really be able to walk several miles thru deep snow with no face mask or gloves in winds that would easily produce subzero temperatures?  Were they really safer walking out in the open from the wolves, with no serious weapons save a couple knives, rather than barricading themselves in the wreckage, where with plenty of water from snow they could survive a week easily?  And then after successfully killing a wolf using a stick with a bullet on the end, you see them in the woods, each carrying a torch, but not a single one carry one of those sticks? You can bet I would be carrying a stick fashioned into a spear or with a bullet on the end!  Obviously, to have a survival type plot, you can't have cell phones work, or have a rifle intact with ammunition ready to go, but there surely would be a way to make their situation more believeable so it doesn't distract from the point of the movie.",1336089600,,2607,4.467368421052631

As one who has studied, photographed and lived with wolves I can tell you unequivocally that wolves are non violent toward people. They are basically timid and avoid human beings at all costs.

Western European peoples have created violent and fearful stories about wolves for centuries. Little Red Riding Hood lied and so has this film. Films like this fuel the brutal arial hunting of wolves in the early spring when the wolves are trapped by deep snows and are helpless to flee, their new born cubs left to die of starvation for the loss of their parents to trophy hunters flying in small planes above them. This happens frequently.

For a more balanced movie about wolves try watching a film based on a true substantiated story about a Canadian Biologist who was the first to study and live with wolves in the 1950s.

I am upset that I invested $15 and 2 hours in the movie to see a good story develop and then slip away right before your eyes.  This movie is worth seeing when it is on a non-paid cable network in 9 months or so.",1335916800,8,445,3.966292134831461
4785967,1,B005LAIIS0,"This movie was awful. Completely unbelievable and lame. Here are some of the MAIN reasons why this was stupid!

1.)  Liam write a letter to his EX with an old school fountain pen.  Really? He is in the middle of Alaska and hes using a fountain pen?
He saves this letter in his pocket.....THIS IS IMPORTANT.
2.) Plane crashes and Liam furiously double belts himself in during its descent, yet after the crash he finds himself thrown from the wreckage, unscathed and not in the seat somehow even though he double belted himself in?
3.)  Liam finds the seat that was in front of him (where he put that letter before the plane went to Hell)he was in somehow in the multitude of crazy burned bodies, debris, etc.  and recovers that letter written in ink....yet this letter is completely legible, he puts it in his pocket for safe keeping..
4.) Wolves actually are MAD at these people, so they are in the middle of Alaska, killing them out of anger and not eating them? really?  give me a break.
5.)  A wolf was actually eating someone (before they realized they were mad) next to a fire, yet now fire scares these wolves away?
6.)  Liam pulls out that letter in the snow, yet still the ink hasn't run and the letter is in perfect codition.
7.) So they run from the wolves, come to a 200 FT high cliff...manage to jump to a tree...descend the tree......yet these same wolves somehow made it 200FT down and across a freezing cold river in 3 minutes so they could attack one of the survivors? Really? So wolves can now fly?
8.)  Liam and his last buddy fall into a freezing river, his buddy somehow gets his foot trapped in a way just not possible given the current...
9.) After being soaked in the river, Liam pulls out that letter again..somehow its dry and legible STILL.....WTF?
10.) Plane crahses, guy still has glasses on, perfectly intact somehow. BUT BUT he loses them while crawling on a rope with a slight breeze....reallllllllllly??????
11.)  So Liam makes a point to retrieve all the wallets of the killed to honor them and for their families. Its hilarious that EVERYONE has a wallet packed with family photos that are truly sentimental.  This is important so Liam can look at them before he stacks them into a neat pile while the Alpha Wolf patiently watches him (while growling ferociously with yellow eyes) from 30 feeet away.  ""Grrrr Grrrr.....I will let this man reflect on his and other's lives before I kill him....grrr....grrrrr""
Save yourself time and watch a werewolf movie.
12) I can go on and on here,,this is one of the worst movies of the year....easily...

The director obviously thought that having Liam was enough.....and assumed that the viewers are stupid.  Wolves don't act like this towards humans and they surely don't kill and NOT eat when there is basically NO food around them.  If you liked this movie, I suggest you view it again and add to my list.  :)",1335744000,73,2885,4.594541910331384
4785968,5,B005LAIIS0,"As a rule, I do not like survival movies at all - 127 Hours sucked big time. Bugger all happened and it put me (and everyone else) to sleep. No offense to the guy who's life it is based on. Watching a guy trapped for several hours hallucinating is not my idea of a good film.

This movie however is an exception to that rule. I went to the cinema to see something else and got my times wrong. It was wet outside so I couldn't be bothered catching my bus home. This was the only thing playing so I went in. I am so glad I did because it was totally worth it.

Liam Neeson just keeps getting better over the years. Some older actors really loose the plot after a while but not this guy. He is brilliant in this movie. I have watched lots of his movies lately and he cant seem to do anything wrong. He is very believable as a grizzled take charge kind of guy, he has a very gripping presence that makes it hard to watch anyone else. He is very commanding on screen & clearly a great leader for this group of lost travellers that crash their plane in a remote wilderness only to be hunted down by a group of large ravenous wolves.

Good characters and plenty of action. You will not be disappointed with this film",1335398400,7,1209,4.114406779661017
4785969,1,B005LAIIS0,"I have less trouble suspending disbelief for things like Star Wars, Underworld, even the tv show ""Grimm"" than I did watching this.

It was hard for someone who spends time outdoors, in the cold , to believe that those guys made it more than 10 minutes walking across the wilderness in a blowing snowstorm, in deep snow, in sub-zero temperatures.  If you've ever WALKED across snow like that, you know how hard it is even if you HAVE snowshoes, much less in work boots.  It's commonly known , if you've been outdoors in the cold, that exposed skin will get frostbite pretty quick in those kinds of conditions.  And they might have walked a 100 yards or more, and said ""to heck with this nonsense.  I'd rather die"".

And wolves... just to be sure, I checked with other people I know who know something about wolves.  This kind of hunting down and killing humans?  Well, it might have happened a couple of hundred years ago, in Europe, where people didn't venture into the woods.  But today?  That was just ridiculous.

They don't do that.

Liam Neeson should be ashamed.  I'm a fan of his... have seen very few movies that he didn't knock it out of the park.
This is like ""Jaws in the Arctic, on land"".

Perpetuating myths.

I saw this in the theater.  Very disappointed.",1335225600,18,1269,4.524229074889868
4785970,4,B005LAIIS0,"I hope this doesn't come as too big of a shock to you: but you're dying. Oh, it probably will take years and I certainly hope for most of us we're talking a multitude of decades. But I can only think of two people who avoided death (they're in the Bible and their names start with `E', you can look it up) and the odds are against us joining that exclusive club.

The Grey is a film about a group of men that are facing death, likely to be sooner rather than later. A group of roughneck oil men survive a plane crash in the Alaskan wilderness but death in the form of starvation, exposure, wolf attack (you read that right) or a number of other unexpected and unpleasant possibilities seems imminent. (There's a reason the phrase ""Feel Good Movie of the Year"" doesn't appear on the film's lobby posters.)

When we first meet the character played by Liam Neeson, Ottway, he is contemplating suicide for reasons that are not initially revealed. But instead he boards the doomed flight and soon finds himself fighting for his life.

In these dire circumstances, the men must deal with the essential choices of fear and faith. One character in the film, Diaz (Frank Grillo), claims to have neither faith nor fear. Ottman calls him a fool for not being afraid in such a time, arguing it is idiocy to be fearless. Another character, Talget (Dermot Mulroney) calls him a fool for not having faith in God and a life to come.

So is fear or fearlessness foolish? (Sorry about the excessive alliteration.) Ottman makes a very persuasive argument that fear is the most rational response to certain situations. But toward the end of the film, Ottman receives powerful arguments against fear from a couple of unexpected sources. The film seems to argue that fear is understandable, perhaps even unavoidable, (director Joe Carnahan certainly give the audience some scares), but something that must be overcome.

For Christians, Scripture also seems to provide a schizophrenic view of fear. Proverbs 9:10 says that ""Fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom."" Jesus argues (in Luke 12:5) for the good sense in fearing God. But note that it's just the beginning. The most common command in Scripture, spoken by angels and Jesus Himself is, ""Don't be afraid."" I John 4:18 says that ""Love drives out fear.""

The Bible seems to say that fear can be a good start for assessing our situation without God's love and forgiveness. But it has no place in our lives once we have placed our faith in God's goodness. But many of the characters in ""The Grey"" don't believe in God, let alone a God of Mercy. They've lived brutal lives and are facing the possibility of a brutal death. Where is God in that?

In fact, one of the characters calls out to God to show Himself (in a scene reminiscent of the cries of Job in Scripture, just much more profanity filled) and God seems to be silent.

But is God ever fully silent?

In Romans 1:20, the apostle Paul argues, ""For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature--have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that people are without excuse.""

The film doesn't scrimp on showing the brutality of our fallen world. But we also see much of the beauty of God's creation, not just in the majestic landscapes of the Alaskan wilderness, but also in acts of kindness and bravery from the most unlikely of human sources. Faith in God is essential to live. But it is even, perhaps, more essential for death.

(2012's ""The Grey"" is quite justifiably rated R for brutal violence and language, but not for the occasionally awkward computer generated wolf images. Don't miss the film's final image which appears after the end credits.)",1335225600,2,3718,4.6871165644171775

4786017,5,B005LAIIS0,"I liked this film a lot, mostly because it is SO DIFFERENT from most of the Hollywood recent offerings in adventure/survival category. This difference must however remain a surprise, therefore I simply can not elaborate, to avoid the spoilers.

The one thing probably everybody already knows is that this is a film about a group of people stranded in northern Alaska in the middle of nowhere, during a winter harsh even by local standards. The way they arrive to the place of departure of their ordeal is VERY well described! The group counts initially eight members - but without providing any real spoilers, I can say that of course not all will make it until the final credits. Another thing I can reveal is that guessing the exact identity of all those who will survive is not an easy task - I for one completely failed...

Another thing probably known to anybody interested in this film, is that some wolves are involved. Here, the only thing that I can say, is that this film avoids both typical ""wolf movie"" wolf traps. First, there is absolutely NO fantastic elements - the wolves are simply a bunch of very pragmatic and down to earth (or rather snow) hungry fellows, who just happen to be well skilled in their trade... Second, there is no New Age/ecologist wolf worshipping - wolves are animals with all the wonderful and nasty things that it implies. And wolves will be wolves. Period.

Alaskan winter wilderness is shown in an incredible way, in its full majestic, cruel and merciless beauty. Visually, this film is breathtaking and for that reason I advise to buy it in Blu-Ray rather than in classical DVD, as here every pixel counts.

Liam Neeson is GREAT! There is simply no other way to describe his performance. His character is very believable and I found it really likeable. Without revealing too much I can also say that I felt for him a lot, as he is a man in lots of pain, from the beginning of film, as it is shown in the two first minutes - and nothing more will be said...

Other characters are also rather well developped and actors play them well. Most of actors were completely unknown to me, with the exception of Dermot Mulroney, who clearly went a long way since his beginnings in romantic comedies in the 90s...

You should not expect any ""Rambo"" or other ""Great White Hunter"" moments. The film is very realistic and all the ""heroes"" are just ordinary people, who found themselves in a very extraordinary situation. They begin their trek for survival already under big shock and are most of the time very tired, very cold and very very scared - and that means that they make mistakes, which people comfortably sitting in a warm cinema and having all the time of reflexion they want, would probably avoid... I found this vulnerability of all the characters, including the one who is in principle the most skilled in survival, a very realistic touch.

But the thing that is the most impressive is the study of the approach of those people to their very possible future death. In the immediate proximity of death people start to see the world differently and understand things which remained for them a mystery previously. Now, there is no preaching in this film - here, there is no better or worse way to deal with the sound of approaching steps of the Grim (or here rather Grey) Reaper. But there are many different ways. And as far as I am concerned, that was for me the main point of ""The Grey"" - how scared, exhausted and suffering people face the high probability of a horrible death, when in the same time struggling with all their forces to live another day.

Bottom line, I found this film a very excellent thing, I spend a very good cinema moment and I am going to buy the Blu-Ray as soon as it is available.",1333324800,,3749,4.585074626865672
4786018,2,B005LAIIS0,"I'm a fan of Liam Neeson, and he and the other actors did a fine job here, no qualms there. The problem I had was with the story. It was mostly a character development showcase, and featured very little adventure or action.

The characters were being picked off one by one, and surrounded by a huge pack of wolves. They set up a camp fire and for what seemed like the majority of the film, spent time telling crude campfire stories to keep their sanity. With that fire, they could've lit up the forest to keep the wolves at bay, but they were too busy quarreling with each other to consider such options. I found it tough to relate to anyone here but Liam's character.

Well acted? Yes. Dramatic film? Yes. Exciting adventure? Hardly until the end, when things picked up pace slightly. It wouldn't be fair to compare this to the other well known forest adventure ""The Edge"" with Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin trying to escape a killer Grizzly, but don't go in expecting something similar, and you may very well enjoy this film. Otherwise, heed the warning. This is NOT an adventure movie and wasn't designed as one, as the trailers seemed to have suggested... Very disappointed.

I knew within the first few minutes what kind of movie this was going to be.  Completely unlikable characters who are scripted to use the f bomb for every line they say makes one so depressed about the state our screen writers are in these days.  Not only that but they were terribly clich'ed as well, led by a big nosed phone his lines in Liam Neeson.  Their is no way Mr. Neeson read this script and these characters and thought it would make a convincing or entertaining story.  My opinion of Liam Neeson has dropped considerably after seeing this movie,  thats how bad it was.  So everyone is firmiliar with the story by now so I won't go into great detail about it.  All I can say is that I despised the characters so much that I found myself rooting for the computer animated wolves.  The worst offence this film commits is its attempt to be profound.  Really! you are really going to try and be deep and philisophical about life and the existence of god with a movie Steven Segal would problaly have passed on.  Thats right we get a whole embarrassing scene of Neeson swearing out god and deciding to go after the computer animated wolves by himself.  Q one of The most unexciting finales in a movie ever.  The movie was beautiful to look at, however, the sheer amount of expetives severly detracted from the films visual beauty.  I can liken it to taking a road trip during fall or spring with that friend who has a barrel of full swear jars at home.

4786109,4,B005LAIIS0,"""The Grey"" is a suspenseful film that I recommend thoroughly.  It' very intense; by no means is it a date movie.  Indeed, it was unexpectedly good.

The movie involves a very dramatic plane crash somewhere in Alaska or northern Canada in the depth of winter.  I might add that the crash itself is brilliantly crafted.  Top film making!  There are a handful of survivors and if the crash wasn't bad enough, they now have to contend with ravenous wolves.

It would be wrong of me to reveal any further details as to the ultimate outcome.  However, I can say that the terror of this Arctic wasteland really is frightening.  Liam Neeson plays the de facto leader of the group.  He has clear experience with the landscape and wolves; he was employed by the oil company for which they all worked as a wolf hunter.

This is a good one.",1330473600,,604,4.5504587155963305
4786111,3,B005LAIIS0,"I was disappointed. Why? The Grey had been touted as an action thriller. One reviewer extolled its amazing crash scene. These are pure lies.

First, the crash scene. You don't really see much, just flashes of what's happening. I wouldn't get all excited about its supposed realism.

Next, the action. Here's where it is a serious disappointment if you went into this (as I did) expecting something along the lines of The Edge. The ""action"" is nothing much. Characters get killed randomnly, one by one, whether by wolves, falls, etc. There's no logic to it, no smart, resourceful comebacks (except maybe one, making a boom-stick). It's just ""we have to keep moving"". Those who can't or don't, die. Some deaths are more creative than others, but not by much. This is not ""action"". It's more like another sequel of Final Destination.

So, why all the rave reviews?

Well, you have to watch it from another vantage point - Liam as The Grey, too. We see this mirrored in the movie. As the alpha wolf puts down a challenger, Ottway, too, must defend his alpha status. Starting off as suicidal, The Grey Outdoors makes Ottway struggle to live. Others - well, just one, really - die from losing that will to survive. (Actually, the others die, as I said, randomly. Not much in the way of intelligent plot there.)

Does this really save the movie? Not a whole lot.

The other thing that may have critics swooning is Ottway's challenge to God to save him, in the face of all the random and senseless death. Of course, there is no heavenly answer - just The Grey Sky. ""I'll do it myself,"" he concludes. All kinds of chatter about how philosophical this is. But is it really? Seriously? He makes a deal with God - if you save me, I'll serve you the rest of my life! Now, it would take a pretty poor philosopher to think that makes any kind of serious point. The same question has been asked in worse times, e.g. the Holocaust, and Gethsemane. The answer is only for serious questioners.

There is some decent characterization here. We learn why Ottway's wife left him, and why he's suicidal. His ""scum of the earth"" companions seem like real people. That makes the randomness of their demises more jarring. And I kept wondering why they didn't just burn the trees around them that harbored their predators, but I'm probably just ignorant of tree-burning lore.",1330041600,2,3110,5.268686868686869

The Grey was a decent although not a great movie right up until the ending. At which point everyone in the theater groaned and complained about the ending. Us included. In fact a few of the theater patrons did more than groan, they were quite upset with the ending.

If you want to see a movie with good or satisfying or complete ending, then you might as well skip this movie. I read the reviews but missed the fact that this movie leaves the ending up to you, ie. it has no ending. I'm really upset that we wasted the time and money to see this movie. You go to the movies expecting entertainment, a good story and a good or at least complete ending. This movie does not have an ending, what it has is that you are supposed to decide what happens. I really dislike movies like that. I write and would never leave my readers hanging there with no real ending.

4786154,4,B005LAIIS0,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed Liam Neeson's new film ""The Grey"". Not because of Liam Neeson; he has developed into quite an action star over the last few years, bringing an undeniable, believable intensity to silly, over-the-top genre films. I was surprised because the film was co-written and directed by Joe Carnahan, the writer and director of ""Smokin' Aces"" and ""The A-Team"", two of my least favorite films ever.

Neeson has transformed himself from respected independent film actor and dramatic leading man to a viable action star, appearing in the improbably silly Luc Besson film ""Taken"", made more palatable and interesting by his completely serious and believable performance. It was also a hit, so he followed that with ""Unknown"", another film made so much better by his commanding persona. Another hit. Now, we have ""The Grey"", proving he can ""open"" an action film, making him more bankable in Hollywood power circles.

Ottway (Neeson) is a guard at an oil drilling facility in the farthest reaches of the Alaskan tundra. The men who work here do dangerous work for high pay and seem to spend their off-time drinking to help them forget where they are. Ottway accompanies the men when they leave the base and uses his high power rifle to keep them safe from hunting wolves. The men seem to live for their R & R back in civilization and rowdily crowd onto the plane eager for the trip to Anchorage. Shortly after the plane takes off, it runs into turbulence and crashes. Ottway and a handful of survivors band together and attempt to get back to civilization. But they soon realize they have to deal with more than just the elements; the plane crash landed in the middle of a pack of wolves. And they're hungry.

The survivors include Talget (Dermot Mulroney), Hendrick (Dallas Roberts, TV's ""The Good Wife"", and ""3:10 to Yuma""), Diaz (Frank Grillo, ""Warrior"", TV's ""The Gates""), Burke (Nonso Anozie, ""Conan the Barbarian""), Flannery (Joe Anderson, TV's ""The River""), Hernandez (Ben Bray) and Lewenden (James Badge Dale, ""Shame"", ""The Departed""). Each of these men has different backgrounds, strengths and problems all of which will lead to complications for the group and provide challenges to one and all.

Carnahan spends a significant amount of time establishing Ottway's character, allowing us to watch him in the strange environment of this oil drilling station. We watch as he does his job, scanning the horizon for wolves near the workers, protecting the humans from the wild beasts. Later we watch as he deals with the loneliness, the isolation of this outpost. We spend some time listening to his thoughts. We watch some brief snippets of dreams and remembrances back to time he spent with his wife. This helps to establish why it is so important for him to make it back to civilization, why it is so important for him to survive. These moments are very effective and help us get into Ottway's mind and become a part of his journey.

But as great as these are, the other characters are not established as well. Throughout the journey, as the men make their way across the snow and ice, they share remembrances, stories and dreams, giving us a brief insight into their lives. We learn a little about them, enough I guess, given the significance of these characters, but the level of detail pales in comparison to Neeson. I can't help but wonder what someone like Michael Mann might have done. Every character in ""Heat"" has some back-story.

As the rowdy men crowd onto the plane, anxious for some R & R, we watch the technicians trying to deice the wings and get the aircraft moving. During the flight, we get our first individual glimpses of most of the characters and start to learn about them. But because there are so many of them, it is difficult to set them apart.

As soon as the plane begins to experience trouble, you know you are in for something different. It just looks and feels different, more authentic, and more intense. And the moment of the plane crash is particularly harrowing. You really feel as though you are in the plane with the men. I doubt this is a selling point for most, but it helps to make the film feel authentic. It also happens fast. In most films, plane crashes seem to happen in slow motion, allowing us to revel in every special effect and filmmaking trick the director has in his arsenal.

Because of this early moment, the intensity of it, Carnahan has a lot to live up to and thankfully, there are other moments which will in all likelihood bring you to the edge of your seat.

The journey is punctuated by harrowing moments when the men have to overcome an obstacle; traversing a gorge on a single rope, fighting off wolves, dealing with the elements. Naturally, as soon as someone comes up with the idea of traversing a gorge on a single rope, someone will have a fear of heights. This fear leads to problems. The real journey comes in how these disparate men overcome these obstacles. And because each of the men is different, they will react differently to these tests.

Carnahan doesn't shy away from depicting the harshness of the conditions or the environment. It's a bleak place and I can't imagine I would survive for 10 minutes. It looks uncomfortable and I can't imagine the actors were in the lap of luxury during the shoot.

""The Grey"" is a surprisingly effective action film. Neeson's intensity adds a lot to the film, but Carnahan's attention to detail also help to paint a picture of survival you really feel you are a part of until the bitter end.

I'm not sure if I am helping generate any business for the film or not.",1329177600,4,5605,4.713993871297242
4786155,3,B005LAIIS0,"""The Grey"" is the latest film from writer/director Joe Carnahan, who's previous outings all had a dark and moody feel to them, although this movie is a definitely a different turn for him. Most of his movies are set in urban environments, like ""Narc"", ""Smokin' Aces"" and ""Blood, Guts, Bullets & Octane"" and ""The Grey"" is far far far from anything urban.

The movie is about an Alaskan oil drilling team that is on their way to a big job when their plane drops out of the sky and in the middle of a snowy tundra and there are only seven survivors. They are held prisoner by the elements and are forced to adapt to the very assurance that they will most likely die. They are led by a team sniper named Ottway, played by Liam Neeson, who is along for the trip because of his ability to shoot wolves and protect the workers. This is a skill that certainly comes in handy as they are greeted by a pack of wolves on night one.

On top of dealing with bitter cold, wounds from the plane crash and knowing that they won't be found anytime soon, the wolves that don't eat but kill become an overwhelming obstacle. ""The Grey"" has a very dark overtone, as probably goes without saying. It is definitely a testosterone movie, filled with men being men and men figuring out ways to survive as long as they can.

I would be amiss if I stated that the movie didn't hold my attention throughout, but there is much about ""The Grey"" that left me with a disappointing taste in my mouth. First of all, the movie plays out like a horror movie with its predictable one at a time story layout. There have been many movies similar to this in the past, like ""Alive"" and ""The Edge"" where a man had to survive a grizzly bear, and ""The Edge"" managed to hold you on the edge of your seat throughout. It was unpredictable and frightening. ""The Grey"" is very predictable and once you see the pattern, you know it doesn't get any better.

The movie leaves you with a empty feeling as it explores life, religion, hope and death throughout. You get to know the men who are facing impossible odds and you root for them till the end. Yet, ""The Grey"" is what it is, a dark, moody, dreary story about living and dieing.",1329177600,,2181,4.338235294117647
4786156,5,B005LAIIS0,"I enjoyed the movie. Nonstop action. One survival decision after another. Liam Neeson at his quick-thinking tough guy best. The wolves were big, mean and bad just like in Red R.

4786157,5,B005LAIIS0,"What is an epic? An epic is a story that defines an entire genre as it should be, giving way to non-stop character development and a conflict that is either unresolved or is just resolved for the main character(s). An epic is a story with such a deep meaning and deliverance that it can go down in the history books for being life-changing or truly open minded. Examples of these are Gladiator, The Iliad, Saving Private Ryan, and Blade Runner; historical and science fiction epics. Now, there is the survival epic; The Grey. Starring Liam Neeson, this story about human courage and endurance is a simple, yet complex tale; the performances by every actor in the film are just stunning, believable every second of the time. The direction and pacing of the action scenes and in-depth storytelling was some of the best work i've ever seen; it's what you'd expect if Ridley AND Tony Scott were both producers of this film. Their presence just tells you that this will be epic in some way, shape or form, and it is. In a solid 117 minutes, this film dives head-first into a pool of our worst fears and comes out an emotional masterpiece with a deep meaning and an epic conclusion that makes you see how valuable life really is. Some people say the ending was stupid, pointless or unnecessary, but when you watch it, pay attention to Ottway's father's poem and recognize the events that happened on the way to where he ended up; this film truly is a survival epic.

Their transport crashes in a frozen wilderness. They are beset by the predators which bear a superficial physical resemblance to wolves. The men even call them ""wolves"". These aren't very creative people.

The story of how the survivors of the crash persevere is well made and includes some very good scenes. Overall though, it's a pretty stupid movie. The animated/animatronic creatures aren't especially credible. And it's pretty obvious the reason these predators are attacking is that the humans have wiped out their natural prey - after all they are the only non-human creatures we see in an entire two hour movie that takes place entirely out doors.

This is the worst Liam Neeson movie I have ever watched. Plot? No plot. No character development. Horrible screenplay.  We see John Ottway (Liam Neeson) in Alaska protecting oil workers from the indigenous animals that would want to do them harm while working in the field. He shoots a wolf that charges some workers working on a pipe in a field. We get flashbacks of a woman whom I'm assuming is his wife? Maybe. We don't find out...ever. You can tell in these opening scenes he is a little depressed and we are assuming it is the women in his flashbacks. One night he is goes into the bar for a few shots of alcohol and leaves to end up behind a building ready to shoot himself with his rifle. He hears wolves howling and decides not to kill himself. Change scenes to next day and he is going to be getting on a plane to the lower 48. It just so happens the camera catches the crew on the tarmac attempting to de-ice the plane. The plane is full of oil workers and one sits next to Neeson and begins to talk his ear off. Neeson is annoyed and asks him to be quiet and he is going to shut his eyes. The guy moves and Neeson dreams of the woman again. Action scene ensues and the plane goes down with Neeson waking up in the snow. He walks over a ridge and sees the plane destroyed and goes to look for survivors. We've seen all these scenes so far in the previews. No big deal right? Wrong. Neeson finds only he and 6 other people survive and they attempt to stay warm and not die. Neeson explains they will not be found since the oil company doesn't care. Now the wolves come and start to eat the dead. They post lookouts and during the night the lookout is killed by wolves. They find him in the morning and Neeson tells the survivors they need to get to the tree line to better defend themselves. He explains if they are within a certain amount of miles to the wolves den they will keep coming to defend it and more than likely kill them all. They go for the tree line and end up getting picked off one by one until the last scene is of Neeson who ends up in the den. During the entire movie Neeson has flashbacks of the woman and his father. The last flashback of the woman is her in a hospital with an IV drip so we're assuming she is now dead and that is why he is depressed. Again we have no idea because we don't learn anything about his character or any of the other survivors. Nothing. The last scene is of Neeson and conveniently he is only going to fight the alpha wolf in the den. He gets ready, he has a knife, tapes broken liquor bottles to one hand and recites a poem his father wrote. He and the wolf are ready to fight and BAM, black screen, roll credits. What?!? The entire theater burst out crying ""NO"" and cursed the screen. I walked out of the theater feeling I just got mugged in the alley. Not even rental worthy",1328140800,14,2853,4.176043557168784
4786288,4,B005LAIIS0,"Though directed by Joe Carnahan and written by Carnahan and Ian Mackenzie Jeffers, the driving force behind the story and themes in The Grey is a man who died almost a hundred years ago:  the great American writer, Jack London.  His name appears nowhere in the credits and the film is not adapted from  any of his stories, yet it's a sure bet that both Carnahan and Mackenzie are intimately familiar with him because his literary fingerprints are all over this film.  If you've read London, then you know exactly what you're in for.  If you haven't read London, then you probably don't.

The basic plot in The Grey is remarkably simple:  a plane transporting a group of workers from a remote Alaskan oil drilling station during a blizzard crashes in the wilderness, leaving only a handful of survivors.  The survivors quickly discover that they not only have to contend with being stranded in the freezing wilderness with little in the way of food or shelter and even less in hope of rescue, they are also being beset by a pack of highly aggressive and territorial wolves who view them as intruders to be eliminated.  It's man against nature and the elements.  It's Jack London's world, with all that that implies, updated into the 21st century.

The center of the story is in its main point-of-view character, John Ottway (Liam Neeson), a man who specializes in protecting oil field workers in the field from wilderness predators, most particularly wolves, watching for them and picking them off with his rifle if they make any moves to attack the workers.  Ottway is a man beset by memories and an overwhelming sense of loss centered around a woman we see only in snippets of flashback.  But for all of his depression and loss, there is still something primal in Ottway, something that can still pull him out of himself.  In an early scene, when Ottway is on the verge of giving in to his despair, he unexpectedly hears a wolf howl at the critical moment.  The searching look on Neeson's face when he looks up at the howl says more than any spoken words possible could.

Neeson brings, as always, a centering gravitas to the role and in terms of the action he's the one who makes things happen as Ottway quickly - and quietly - takes control of the situation after the plane has crashed.  But it's a mark of the work Carnahan and Jeffers did with the script and the directing that The Grey is much more than just Neeson and is a far cut above the usual cliched work that Hollywood films of this theme usually fall into.  The Grey engages you in ways far beyond the who's-gonna-die-next-and-how-are-they-doing-to-die? formula most films of this genre never rise above. Armed with a well-done script and dialogue, the supporting cast do an excellent job, both of fleshing out their characters as individuals and of convincing you of the kind of bonding that can come - however awkwardly and uneasily - when groups of strangers suddenly find themselves confronted by the ultimate in desperate situations.  One of the things I really liked were the scenes where nervous laughter would sometimes break out in the group as they seize upon the damnedest things to laugh about, drawing them towards each other and away from their fears.  Frank Grillo in particular as the hard-case ex-con Diaz gives an outstanding performance, taking what could easily have been a throwaway clich of a character and making him sympathetic in surprising and subtle turns.  When these characters die, it _matters_ to you.  Which makes the film matter and keeps you thoroughly engaged all the way to the end.

The script also makes a lot of subtle and clever contrasts, one of them being showing men as a pack dealing with wolves as a pack.  A good example is a scene in which the characters suddenly hear some fierce growling followed by a painful yelp coming from the woods around them.  When one of the men asks ""What was _that_?"", Ottway explains that it was the alpha wolf of the pack putting down a challenge from one of the other wolves.  A few minutes later, Ottway ends up doing exactly the same thing when one of the other men in the group challenges his authority.  No narration or exposition is needed - the film smoothly and efficiently gives exactly enough to make its point and no more.

I will mention in advance that not everyone will like the way The Grey ends.  It caught me somewhat by surprise, but in looking back on it, I feel that it could not have ended any other way.  To give it the kind of clean, neat Hollywood ending that people tend to expect would have violated the spirit of the film and everything that it had subtly built up to.  The poem that Ottway recites earlier in the film, one he remembers that his father had written, comes back again in the final scene:

""Once more into the fray,
Into the last fight I'll ever know.
Live and die on this day.
Live and die on this day.""

When you reflect on that, and on everything that goes on throughout the film, you realize that the film ends the way it had to in order to stay true to itself, and it's to Carnahan's credit that he didn't take the easy way out.

And speaking of credits, there is apparently a very brief post-credits scene (which I did not know about) that you may wish to wait for.  Whether or not it clarifies or muddles things appears to be a matter of interpretation and argument as different people come away with different reactions and interpretations of it, and with differing opinions as to whether it added to or detracted from the main ending.  Not having seen it myself, I find that I don't feel I need to as I felt the main ending was exactly the way it should be. But I did feel I should mention its existence so that you can choose to catch it if you want to.

The only reason I don't give this film a full five stars rating is because of the way the wolves are depicted.  I know that it's largely a literary license taken by the writers to give the film its core conflict, but it does perpetuate the traditional stereotype of wolves as predatory threats towards humans when in reality they are quite wary and shy of humans and would not behave in the way the wolves in the film do.

But that aside, I recommend The Grey as a well-written and directed London-esque film dealing with men in a life or death struggle against nature and the elements.",1327968000,5,6335,4.548017621145375

Into the last good fight I'll ever know.
Live and die on this day.
Live and die on this day.

And with these words, the Grey becomes in my mind, the greatest film of its generation in this genre, although I am not quite sure what exact genre that is.

I saw the Grey 4 days ago, on the big screen, and it has not left my mind since.  It is, by far, the best film I have seen in a very long time.  It is truly, as Mr. Neeson puts it, about ""Men, unfit for mankind"" against mother nature in all of her absolute fury, but most of all it is a pulse pounding and riveting exploration of loss and real courage, and faith, and how real men face almost insurmountable odds, and how men, in the worst of circumstances treat and regard their fellow man.  I was devastated by ""the Grey"" in all of its ferocious and poetic power.

First, the acting was astounding.  From Mr. Liam Neeson (who is in my mind a bona fide action star with incredible acting ability) to Frank Grillo, and Dermot Mulrooney, and the rest of the cast, the acting was the best I have seen in ages.  The acting seemed so natural, and truly imitated the way real people, especially men, actually relate to each other. it is probably the first time I have ever actually seen it captured so well and naturally on film.

  The cinematography, and the story were excellent.  The movie is grim, ultra violent, dark, but it is also an incredibly deft and soul wrenching journey into what it means to be a man and have real courage in the face of almost certain death?  It asks, how would I treat my fellow man in the worst hell the cosmos can conjure up? The Grey is also a film about and of faith, and of loss, and not just the loss that is depicted on film, but the silent loss and pain that so many men (maybe all men) have and go through in their lives and carry with them (whether it be self destructive in origin, or bad luck, or loss of loved ones, or what ever form it takes). The Grey is brilliant on both a physical and metaphorical level.

  Truthfully, I was devastated by this film, and any time a character died, I felt each death so intensely (I looked around and there were grown men in the theater sobbing silently).  Anytime a character revealed himself, in terms of his life and his view/faith, his own loss, I was transfixed.  Some of these characters were seemingly rotten scoundrels, but ultimately I grew to give a damn about them, and their plight, and that. in my opinion, is the brilliance of ""the Grey"".  These men were revealed ultimately to be not scoundrels who were at their core bad men, but men, who had made too many mistakes, like so many of us, and just couldn't get their lives kick started out of the hurricane that consumes so many lost souls.  As a man viewing this, it struck me as an incredibly deep study of the true heart of man.  I felt that any one of these fellows could have been me or one of my friends out there.  I did not want in any moment, for any one of these characters to die.  I said to myself, I am watching a movie, a work of fiction, but am reacting like what was on screen was something real.  It felt that way to me.  And I can give ""the Grey"" no greater praise.  For example, when I learned towards the end, why Liam Neeson was so pained in his soul, it had a huge emotional impact on me.  A real and quiet impact.  I said to myself, this is the way that I would be if I experienced this, I think, although who can know until you go through something like that.

  Other reviewers here have briefly summarized the plot far better than I could, and I would say that on its surface it is an extremely well told survival tale... extremely intense and violent, with 7 men trying to escape a ravenous pack of wolves hell bent on punishing them physically and metaphorically, but what is interesting is that the rest of mother nature nature was just as, if not more, brutal towards these souls as the wolves were.  It is almost as if the wolves could have been an afterthought to mother nature's fury and rage.

For me, the Grey was not just a film, but an experience. If you are a deep thinking man or person, I believe that The Grey will be an experience for you to savor.  It is also a hell of an exciting movie, but I was so plugged in, that the excitement was just an after thought for me against the emotional intensity of this cinematic masterpiece.  Joe Carnahan, Liam Neeson, and all of you who made this happen, I say bravo to you, and tip my cup and hat to the masterpiece you have put on the screen.  Thank you.  Thank you.

I have read some reviewers complaining about the ending, and I have to say to them, ""Are you kidding me?""  It is the right ending.  Make sure you stay till the end of the credits and you will learn what happened.  Anyone who doesn't like the ending, I truly believe misses the point... of what the Grey is saying.  thank you for reading.

P.S. I am absolutely interested in hearing other people's thoughts.  Feel free to send me some comments.",1327968000,52,5017,4.2357894736842105
4786290,3,B005LAIIS0,"THE GREY is an okay movie.  If I tell you the basic story, you'll think it's just a typical pulp action film...but the quality of cinematography, sound, script and acting elevates it to something a bit loftier.  As I watched it, I appreciated the effort the filmmakers were putting into this.  An element of existentialism that you can actually feel on an emotional level.

Yet at the same time, the film has people doing some incredibly stupid things, akin to what teenagers in slasher flicks might do.  Couching unexplainable behavior within an ""artsy"" framework doesn't make it any easier to swallow.

Liam Neeson is introduced working at a far northern Alaska installation.  His job is as a sniper of wolves, keeping the compound safe from these dangerous predators.  He's also contemplating suicide, but holds off at the last moment.  Thus, he ends up on an ill-fated flight from the installation.  The plane goes down in the middle of nowhere, leaving about seven survivors amidst the wreckage.  It is during these post-crash scenes that we truly get to see what a natural, physical leader Neeson's character is.  He barks orders that quickly organize the survivors and he sternly but gently attends the dying moments of a passenger as he bleeds out.  The death is looked upon in a series of powerful close-ups...and the stage is set that this isn't merely a movie in which a death is simple and unemotional.  The scene has power, and it also serves as the moment when the other survivors (for the most part) embrace the notion that Neeson is going to be their leader.

Soon, they discover that their wrecked fuselage is being stalked by man-eating wolves.  So Neeson decides that instead of waiting for possible but unlikely rescue in the plane and facing the wolves there, he suggests they grab what supplies they can and head for a tree line off in the distance, because he thinks the wolves MIGHT leave them alone if they think the men are leaving their territory.  This is a central decision, because most of the film follows thereafter...and yet it is not for ONE SECOND convincing.  It is stupid on the face of it.  Yes, wolves are stalking them...but they are in a location which provides some shelter from the HARSH wintry conditions, they have food and luggage to rummage through (which they never thoroughly do...who's to say someone wasn't carrying a satellite phone in their bag?) and it seems unlikely the wolves would swarm en masse into a giant steel structure.  And wouldn't large, ragged pieces of steel make excellent weapons against the wolves?  Instead, the men set out on foot in the hopes the wolves will leave them alone.  To say they made the wrong choice is understating matters (this is hardly a spoiler...it's what the film is ABOUT).  In my mind, Neeson is instantly established as a charismatic, tough-talking, tough-minded, physically adept FOOL.

Once they have made this choice, what follows are a series of man vs. man & man vs. nature encounters.  The characters are all nicely sketched, and some, such as the ex-con presented by Frank Grillo, are actually very well-rounded.  The men bond.  They fight.  They endure.  They make ever more desperate choices.  And the movie actually asks some big questions about death and facing death.  The manner in which we chose to go out...when given a choice.  As I said, it's more existential than you might expect.  There is less action and more contemplation that some viewers probably expect.  It's refreshing that the film would take the time to explore some of the moral quandaries it does.  And it ends more logically than I would have expected, given some of the dumb choices from earlier in the film.

I got past the terrible decision making early in the film, because I appreciated the excellent technical filmmaking throughout.  Director Joe Carnahan has given us a mean, unforgiving film...not a soft adventure where you can predict 10 minutes into it who will live and who will die.

But even with all the good things I just said, THE GREY is lacking.  Just little things.  The weather is incredibly cold, yet frostbite and exposed faces is a non-issue.  A wolf viciously attacks one man, yet when the wolf is fought off, the man has virtually no injuries...yet in an earlier, similar scene, the victim is torn apart.  There are just enough annoying inconsistencies, coupled with the one really bad initial decision to have pulled me out of really committing to this film.  It's ultimately a three-star, just barely recommend for me.",1327881600,2,4526,4.846153846153846
4786291,3,B005LAIIS0,"I love movies like this.

Unfortunately, this new movie had major issues even my city wife noticed right off.

First off, let me say this is a solid movie, but came up short of being one of the greatest of its genre, due to the shortcomings of its storyline and survival techniques.

First off, the crash of the plane: I had to suspend disbelief that so many could crash in a plane and come away almost, if not totally, unscathed. Liam Neeson's character wakes up all by himself in the snow, like a car had thrown him out on pillowy snow, not an airplane in brutal conditions. Yeah, right!

Secondly: I had to again suspend disbelief that a group of timber wolves all the sudden hunt humans. At least the director/writer tried to explain this, but it was weak. (BTW, the CGI wolves were the best part of this movie!)So, again, as a moviegoer I have to say, OK, I'll let that go for the sake of entertainment.

Thirdly: Why would manly men leave the plane crash? They had everything there! Food, shelter, warmth, and the very place that rescuers would be looking. And not one man created or fashioned weapons out of all the debris, even though a pack of huge wolves almost instantly attacked them! Stupid.

Fourth: Now Liam Neeson's character plays the hunter that protects the oil men, killing and shootings wild wolves, right? And since he is supposed to know about hunting, animals behavior, etc, then why does he take the survivors right to the very den of the wolves he told the men he was helping was the very bloody reason these wolves were acting the way they were?!

Fifth: Now, why on earth did no character bother to fashion spears and walking sticks from the numerous trees that always surrounded them? Here they are, trudging wearily through snow drifts and snow storms, and not a one of them thinks primal! Not one of them thinks to trim some branches and make some makeshift weapons/walking sticks to help them defend themselves and just to walk. Been doing that since caveman days, but modern man in this movie never even thought of it. Stupid!!!!!!

Sure, in one scene Liam's character shows the others how to make a sort of shock stick out of branches and shells. OK, on the right track here. Problem is, they use them once and you never even see any of the characters use makeshift spears ever again, despite leg wounds and exhaustion. C'mon, do these directors and screen writers think the audience is that stupid? I guess so, their marketing sucked me in.

And lastly is the ending. Total rip-off! Fade to black my ass! Just like the ending of The Sopranos. Rip-off.

The movie had so much going for it, too. Haunting. Good idea. Interesting characters and plight. Almost totally wasted to to piss poor directing and writing in minute details that even my NY city wife could see that was so stupid and wrong with this film.

I'm just glad the wolves won.",1327881600,5,2874,4.571984435797665

 Review

A man named John Otway works in the Alaskan Wilderness as a protector of an oil drilling team from Wolves. He pens a letter to his wife, then gets on a plane, which crashes and he ends up in the wilderness with other men fighting for his life and the lives around him.

Liam Nesson is one of the older generation's overlooked actors. He is an actor that can take on any role and nail it. He is so method and so intense in his acting ability, he can carry any film that he is in with it. He is remarkable to watch and makes me actually want to go to see the film that he potentially is in.  But in this film, he could've turned in a one-note performance and just chewed scenery, but he turns in a haunting, moving performance that made me weep for his character towards the end.  You get that feeling in your gut after watching the men walk through the wilderness and you just know. Also you feel for the character after getting to know him through out the movie.  Not a lot of actors have that hold on the audience like he does.

Joe Carnahan is a pretty prolific director that has his hits (Smoking Aces), huge misses (A Team) and critically overlooked (Narc). I was worried that he would underwhelm yet again on this one because A Team didn't come out that great and I was disappointed, but I was glad I saw this movie because this movie takes the talent he has shown in Narc and brings it to a another level of solid film-making. The look, pace of the film are really good and made me enjoy the movie even more because with certain directors the material in this film would've or could've been mishandled, but he did it fine. In fact, this could be his masterpiece because it moved me to the point because at the point before I saw it, I had low expectations. I am glad it didn't turn out to be the ACTION FEST TO END ALL ACTION FEST movie the trailer made it out to be.  Everything is just well rounded here, but it does have its flaws.

First flaw is that the side characters that worked with Nesson's character barely had time to get their story. I know there is a 2-hour time limit and there could've been more expanded from the story on those characters because in the last scene, I really didn't feel for them as much as I did Nesson's character because that is basically the main character development that we had in the movie, but the rest not so much.

Yes, I did read there was a lack of an ending, but how do you end a movie like this? It's hard to sit at your computer and go, ""Ok, let's end it this way or that way."" That's not how it works. Some open endings are perfect for some movies, and this movie had a good open ending to make you think on what was going to happen to the character after the film ended.  Plus, I feel some other reviewers missed the theme and the message of the movie to the point where they are making blind criticisms without digesting the film, but you don't have to like everything.

Overall, it was a enjoyable movie and a great thrill ride like the reviews said it was, it had the right amounts of all the stuff that movies are made up of, but there was a lack of some parts that didn't make the movie less enjoyable, but still were there to see.",1327795200,20,3211,4.186385737439222
