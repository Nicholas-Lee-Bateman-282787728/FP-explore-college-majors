8160420,2,B000HXDWVO,"When I bought this program I was hoping for content on more recent Medium tanks but I was disappointed
to find out that most of the tanks and footage is from the second world war. I think this is a good
documentary for tank enthusiasts, WWII enthusiasts and military buffs. The chapters included in this
program are:

1. Panzer Divisions - mostly footage and information about Panzer IIIs and IVs on the Eastern Front
  of Russia (Leningrad and Kursk battles are covered)
2. Development of Cruiser Tanks - Italian tanks and the Mark IIIs and IVs are covered
3. Churchill Tank - coverage includes the M3 and M4 Sherman from the North Africa campaigns
4. Preparing to Invade Sicily - coverage of the M4 Sherman during the Italian campaign
5. Lessons Learned - coverage includes Battle of the Bulge M4 Shermans and the campaigns inside Germany
6. The Iron Curtain - coverage of tanks in the Korean War, Vietnam War footage of helicopter operations
  and of the Patton Medium tank in Vietnam. Then there is a lot of footage on Sweden's
  S-Tank. It's features and technology, as well as exercise footage.

There is no footage or any content from the first Gulf War and later. It is all from WWII and the Cold War
eras. I gave this a three star rating because it did not have any content on later medium tanks and for the
dated content.",1373068800,,1331,4.563025210084033
