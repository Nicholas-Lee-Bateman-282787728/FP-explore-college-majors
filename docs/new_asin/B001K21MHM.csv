4401835,5,B001K21MHM,"Directed by Sun Chung, this 1979 film was the first to utilize the steadycam technique for Shaw Brothers. The plot is so intriguing showcasing a territorial feud. Ti Lung is cast as Master Wang Yang from Dama Bay. He is an expert in Shaolin rod. Meanwhile, a blood feud is going on in a neighboring town between the vicious Meng and benevolelnt Zhou clans.
Having been unsuccessful in recruiting Master Wang as an instructor for his minions, Meng (Ku Feng) & nephew (Tien Chen) carry out a scheme that ultimately meets their goal. Master Wang settled in with the Meng clan, discovers the men are all bullies,so he proclaims in the public square he is impartial to these rules of only teaching for the Meng clan. Eventually, he is forced to leave their employ, but gains a new promising student, Zhou Ping (Wang Yu). Zhou family is murdered while Zhou Ping and Master Wang are hiding out and training.  An inevitable showdown occurs, and the good guys prevail.

This dvd is a region 3 video, and most U.S. dvd and bluray players are not compatible. However, some pcs with cd/dvd drives will play them.  It is restored digitally, the picture aspect is widescreen. The menu is in English & Mandarin, easy to navigate. The best feature is actor's biography in the specials section. Previews of other titles in Shaw's library are included, production notes, posters, etc.

I recommend this title to anyone who has never seen it. Even my spouse liked it!",1326499200,,1448,4.734126984126984
