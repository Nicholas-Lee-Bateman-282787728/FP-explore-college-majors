8047211,1,B0007GBBVY,I thought I was ordering the book.,1448668800,,34,4.0
8047212,5,B0007GBBVY,"If your into Funk then you need these books & DVD. If you already have Rick Latham's 2 books: Advanced Funk Studies & Contemporary Drumset Techniques, then this DVD is a must have. If you don't have them, then you should think serious about getting the 2 books & DVD. Rick has a grounding in Rudimental Drumming and the ease in which he executes the grooves is testament to that.",1283126400,,379,4.428571428571429
8047213,3,B0007GBBVY,The 25th anniversary of the method books has some great examples but there is just too much time spent on the 'anniversary portion' for my taste.  I am a bassist looking to employ some funk drum techniques ans this was not the answer.  No question of Latham's playing - it is supurb but it was not a great 'learning' DVD.,1206835200,,321,4.333333333333333
8047214,1,B0007GBBVY,"I purchased this DVD, after reading the good reviews. however it is a very disappointing, the contense is not organized,ther are no notes of the exercises, and I think that it is irrelevant without the book.",1194998400,,207,4.777777777777778
8047215,3,B0007GBBVY,"I purchased Advanced Studies, full well knowing that it would be a repackage of the previous excellent eponymous video.
However, I was hopeful that the ""Extras"" would include more instruction, or at least updated musical interludes with new interpretations of funk, R&B, African or Latino style drumming.
Unfortunately, this is not the case.  The video extras add very little to the overall original Advanced Studies.
On the plus side, the chapter markings in the original video make it easier to navigate.
This is still a great video, but I highly recommend that you purchase the Advanced Funk book and CD's as well.  They contain a tremendous amount of rudiment work and major variations on the patterns shown on the video.",1190764800,2,725,5.033333333333333
8047216,5,B0007GBBVY,"This video is great because it incorporates both Advanced Funk Studies and Contemporary Drumest Techniques on the same DVD, along with some new material.  Rick Latham is an amazing instructor with a style of playing that will blow you away.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1128470400,3,270,4.977777777777778
8047217,5,B0007GBBVY,"I am a student of Rick's and let me tell you, it was these 2 videos and his book that made it my goal to study with Rick Latham privately. This DVD is actually a combination of Advanced Funk Studies and Contemporary Drumset Techniques, plus some new footage. Rick teaches you some KILLER development exercises that will not only polish your technique, but will make you a smarter and stronger player. If you work through the exercises on this DVD diligently and with a metronome, making sure that you strive for accuracy and with a good feel and groove, you will be well on your way to becoming a very solid and versatile drummer. Rick is easily one of the greatest instructors/clinicians in the world. I highly recommend any of his books and videos. I feel very fortunate to be studying with such a master.",1123372800,6,807,4.572413793103448
8047218,5,B0007GBBVY,"Rick latham is a pioneer for funk and jazz drumming. his ideas are original and great. if you use the dvd as he says you will not only learn some great licks, groves, and solos, but it will make you a much better drummer.",1121731200,3,221,4.045454545454546
8047219,5,B0007GBBVY,"Advanced Funk Studies has been a staple for drummers for over 20 years. The new DVD with both Advanced Funk Studies and Contemporary Drumset Techniques is a must for drummers who wish to understand todays linear style of playing, rock, r & b, hip hop, funk and soul. Latham breaks down the excerises so its easy to find a groove that works with the music. Mr Latham also spends time talking about the importance of proper technique and shows the importance of a strong rudimental foundation. I found it very helpful, easy to follow, with excellent examples of some of the exercises. And more importantly how to incorperate them into to todays music.",1120262400,8,649,4.752212389380531
