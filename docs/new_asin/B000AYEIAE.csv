This is the most horrible acting I have ever seen.

This movie does not even do a good job of sucking.",1137801600,3,133,3.888888888888889
8080453,4,B000AYEIAE,"Four stars for being the funniest film I have seen in ages.  Oops!  This is a bollywood thriller -- .  Four teens sing and dance their way into a beauty contest.  One of the losers (an old school chum of the heroine) has a demented brother who looks like he just spent the last 10 years in a 19th century opium den.  He decides to make sure the heroine never competes with his sister again and comes after her to kill her.  She and her best buddy are staying at a country house.  He breaks in and they manage to kill him.  The rest of the film morphs into a I Know What You Did Last Summer, with the kids trying to hide the body (Let's take him home and put him in the backyard pool!  No one will notice since it needs cleaning!) that keeps showing up as a walking corpse trying to take revenge.  This is just hysterically funny.  As the police go to the summer house (the guy has been reported missing), the kids race ahead because they forgot to clean his blood out of the bathtub (oopsy!) -- what nitwits! Then, they decide to go to Uncle Tom's cabin -- I mean Uncle Tom's beachhouse (really!  I'm not kidding) to get away.  There they are confronted with the most absurd deus ex machina I have seen in ages.  Just sooo funny.  I should comment also on the music in the background.  Who thought of using little bits of the theme from ""The Good, the bad, and the ugly,"" along with the opening music to the old ""Dr. Who"" shows?  Was this supposed to be witty?  We couldn't tell.  But, honestly, we enjoyed this film very much and hope to see another one like it.  Ha!",1136246400,2,1568,4.1806020066889635
8080454,3,B000AYEIAE,"Or so said the poster when I was in the video store in Little India.

The Fog was not one of my favorite Indian films. But it was markedly different from others I have seen. And it makes me wonder if perhaps I am unaware of the context in which it was made. If this is one of the few movies of its sort in India, then it deserves different consideration than to compare it to American horror movies.

This movie had a very fractured feel to it, from the opening sequences to the more typical middle and an ending which was perhaps a synthesis of the two. It's been some time since I saw it, so here is what I remember:

Four Teens: two guys, two girls.

Guy likes girl.

Girl doesn't like guy.

Girl likes guy.

Some sort of comic subplot, also her father is wealthy or something

The four of them go traveling in the country.

Main guy wants sex with main girl.

Resulting extended musical number about love.

Drama Tension Drama.

Ending.

Disappointment.

I like the idea of a ""Musical Thriller"". I think that could be pretty cool. Unfortunately, this isn't the one, at least, not as an American with limited (but patient and forgiving!) understanding. The aforementioned fractured feel of the movie was unfortunate. With better writing, the movie would have broken some good ground.

This to me just seemed like a typical Bollywood clich&eacute;, except with murders and a better poster.",1135209600,,1391,4.574898785425101
