8308994,5,B001HLRVQ2,"Michael Casswell is an accomplished electric guitarist & most excellent teacher.
he has created an inspiring as well as interesting instruction video on the various styles 'n' uses of tremelo used on guitars w/ this DVD
& gives the intermediate to accomplished electric guitar player viewing this video a solid foundation of techniques 'n' tricks to learn from...
definitely from the Jeff Beck school of playing, Casswell demonstrates playing scales w/the bar off of picking one note
as well as giving an interesting 'n' modern variety of trem techniques to inspire greater guitar expression 'n' dramatic effect...
i sure wish that this video was around when i was starting out in ""electric church"" !!!
anyway, i think you'll enjoy Casswell's playing as well as his ""British rock star guitar player"" persona -
as he presents this very valuable video of the most over-looked part of electric guitar playing = proper use of the whammy / tremelo system.
one can imagine Jeff Beck or a very young Eric Clapton giving you the instruction from Casswell's persona 'n' demeanor
as well as his use of a Fender JB Strat for much of the performance & his style of playing = very Beck !
which makes me want to buy Casswell's Jeff Beck ""Slow Blues"" instructional DVD next as
Michael Casswell is most definitely an entertaining & sincere teacher as well as a truly ""good to great"" guitar player !
if you use a Floyd Rose or Kahler or Fender trem in your playing, you should learn lots from this exceptional instructional video = Buy It !",1269648000,4,1523,4.7727272727272725
