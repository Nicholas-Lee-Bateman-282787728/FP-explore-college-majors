8101737,3,B000CSAMH6,"I give this DVD a three because of the ring of terror the best of the two pictures. Terror is fair the best actor is Boris Karloff not Jack Nickolson. The Ring of Terror is like a lot of good B movies. A very good plot, but to short. Why the movie makers did not play out a good plot even if it was a B movie is beyond me. It was not because they were paying the actors to much. Terror is to long because of a fair plot that goes to long and not that good of acting by Nickolson. They say the movies were digitally remastered. I find that hard to believe. The picture on both movies is dark and it takes away from the picture. The sound on Ring of Terror is good. The sound of Terror starts out OK, but goes away. Had these movies been remastered the pictures would not have been so dark and the sound on Terror would have been better. Having said all this the DVD is worth watching if for no other the reason the Ring of Terror.",1412726400,,929,3.9468085106382977
