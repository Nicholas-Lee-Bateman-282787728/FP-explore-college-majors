1. Night Life
2. Head Games
3. Cold As Ice
4. Waiting For a Girl Like You
5. Too Late
6. Say You Will
7. Long Long Way From Home (on DVD only)
8. Double Vision
9. Blue Morning, Blue Day (on DVD only)
10. Dirty White Boy
11. Starrider (on DVD only)
12. Feels Like The First Time
13. Urgent
14. Juke Box Hero (on DVD only!!!!)
15. I Want To Know What Love Is
16. Hot Blooded

As I understand it, Blu-ray was touted as a superior format to DVD, not only because of the improvement in picture quality and sound BUT BECAUSE YOU CAN ALSO FIT A TON MORE DATA ON THE DISC!!!  Why in the world would they leave off some of the BEST performances from this otherwise outstanding concert???  The performance of Juke Box Hero is a Foreigner live staple and it includes a segue into Led Zep's Whole Lotta Love that just KILLS!  This song performance was on the PBS broadcast and it appears on the DVD so why leave it off of the Blu-ray edition?  There are three other terrific performances of some early songs that the band dusted off for their new tours that mysteriously vanished from the Blu-ray edition as well.  I'm just scratching my head over the decision some corporate pencil pushing idiot made to cut this great show down to the current form it was finally released.  What a lame joke on those who want the better sound and picture that Blu-ray offers.  I'm telling you right now, BUY THE DVD INSTEAD AND PUT UP WITH IT - you'll be much happier in the long run.

Performance wise, while I miss Lou Gramm singing, Kelly Hansen just shreds on vocals.  If anything he sounds as good or better than Lou ever did and that's saying a lot.  This band has always been Mick Jones' band and he's made no bones about it in interviews.  I was very impressed that Mick's still got all his chops and he's put together a stellar version of Foreigner this go round.  While they're not the original, they sound as good or better than I've ever heard them live.

This is currently Soundstage's best selling title and there is little wonder why.  If you're a fan, buy it - just don't waste your money on upgrading to the Blu-ray edition.",1251936000,30,2289,4.286046511627907
3739796,5,B001P6OC66,"Ok so this is obviously a concert without Lou Gramm who is one of the best singers (IMHO) of all time but DUDE, Kelly Hanson (formerly of Hurricane) is absolutely mesmorizing and flawless as Lou's replacement. At times, you can feel the hair raise up on your arms when he sings those old hits. The picture in Blu Ray and sound in 5.1 Surround is just amazing. Apparently this is out of print due to prices being asked, I was lucky enought to find this new for $20 but would easily have paid twice or three times that for this DVD. So if your a Foriegner fan and on the fence as to whether to buy this, do yourself a favor and just do it, you won't regret it.",1236729600,7,658,4.108527131782946

8332231,5,B001P6OC66,I get mad to see any foreigner fan rate this anything but excellent. This is a great concert and Kelly does an excellent job.  Please buy this dvd and I hope you have a great surround sound system to crank it up on.  Do me a favor and don't buy Lou Gramm's new cd it is awfull.,1265760000,,277,3.8421052631578947
8332232,1,B001P6OC66,"Yeah, I agree. What is this B.S.?  Lou Gramm IS the voice of Foreigner. Without him singing, like, what's the point? Don't waste your time with this.",1261699200,,149,4.518518518518518
8332233,4,B001P6OC66,"Good concert. They play a good variety of their hit playlist. The only disappointment is that the lead singer is not Lou Graham although he did a fairly decent job of sounding like him. The guitarist, Mick Jones however, is one of the original members and still plays well.",1259712000,,273,4.591836734693878
8332234,5,B001P6OC66,"I was amazed last night when I skimmed through the songs on this blu-ray. I watched it in its entirety this evening.
Now, I've been to a LOT of concerts over the years and have also watched many, many concert DVD's and blu-rays and
this concert is the best concert I've ever seen. I've been a fan of Foreigner for years but not really a hardcore fan.
Regardless, these six guys are tight with every song. I am amazed by Kelly Hanson's voice; great range and very, very
similar to Lou Gramm's voice. Even though I think Lou Gramm had a great voice, Kelly Hanson definitely sounds as good,
if not better, than in the original songs. If you like Foreigner at all you'll love this concert. If you love Foreigner
this is a must buy. Trust me, this concert is fantastic!!!",1256342400,,766,4.401408450704225
