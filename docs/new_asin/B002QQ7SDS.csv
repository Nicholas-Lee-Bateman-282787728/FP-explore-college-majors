8377878,3,B002QQ7SDS,"I've seen many of the James Lipton interviews in the old ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" television broadcasts. Those interviews represent the standard by which I judge all actor interviews. In that context, I only gave the William Shatner interview three stars. While Shatner is interesting, his interviewer, Budd Mishkin failed to elicit the type of responses that James Lipton did with his interviewees.",1447891200,,402,5.396825396825397
