3477388,4,B001AZW73M,I ordered the double feature because the price was good. MISSING is a good good movie. Three burials is a little strange and out there for TLJ but worth watching.,1382400000,,162,4.433333333333334
3477389,4,B001AZW73M,"Love Cate Blanchett and Tommy Lee Jones in this movie. Ron Howard has outdone himself again in directing this movie, one you can watch again and again. I loved it so much I wore out the first disc, if there is such a thing, had to order another, highly recommended.",1369267200,,265,4.32
3477390,5,B001AZW73M,"Great Movie! I never heard of it, but my husband had seen it and it wasn't on Netflix, so I bought it and now I make all of my friends watch it!",1366416000,2,144,3.53125
3477391,5,B001AZW73M,"Tommy Lee Jones delivers a remarkable performance. And Cate Blanchett appears in one of her most memorable roles in The Missing. These are two good westerns full of drama and action.  With all the perils of the Mexican/American border, these two movies put you at the edge of your seat. I love the Wild West landscapes portrayed here. Great landscapes! Very impressive. The Missing is in English/French and has optional English/French subtitles (full screen). The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is in English with optional English/Spanish/French subtitles (full screen/widescreen format). This is a  2 disc set. I highly recommend for those who enjoy westerns.",1365984000,4,665,5.384615384615385

3477393,5,B001AZW73M,"The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada is awe-inspiring thanks to the almost unbelievable acting genius of Tommy Lee Jones. Also, the story line is highly engrossing from the start and only continues to get better and better until its credible and satisfying conclusion. An authentic gem of a movie for the most discriminating viewers. The added bonus of The Missing make this a DVD offer that can't be refused!",1272758400,,412,4.9855072463768115

3477398,5,B001AZW73M,"Great if you love this kind of thing.great west Texas filmology if you like Tommy Lee Jones films,Dwight Yoakum is realistic Sheriff in that area of the world,plus obviously he was a Texan,anyone who has lived,been or rural area south or west of the area will know that rancher character although his area where he grew up and went to school in Texas,the East Texas ranches also are great as are the west from Amarillo to El Paso..down to Brownsville....to Victoria,
.Melquidiades Estrada is a typical guy who goes to US to make some money to send to his family home in Mexico and sad he had to but the knows it is not so bad to do as he has but  he fears every day he sees police when they will send him back. Many of those would be thhe people who really run the ranches Tommy is great as this as Dwight Yoakum is and singer too. He does know the talk and dress and even the boots either for the character of sheriff,as does Tommy Lee Jones. Many try but character is not authentic.",1443052800,,984,4.262032085561497
