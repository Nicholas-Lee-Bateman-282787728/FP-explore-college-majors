8657936,5,B00KDSBTT0,"This is an emotional story of a daughter (Amy) searching for her long-lost father and trying to re-establish their relationship.

With well-timed multifaceted plots of twists and turns: assumed dead father (Bill) is still alive; daughters much older boyfriend is married; fathers pal solder died from friendly fire; her father has dementia... etc.; the story kept me interested until the very end.

It also deals with some serious social issues, such as veterans treatment, mental health issues, homelessness, loyalty... etc. All the characters are multi-dimensional, well-portrayed, well-developed and well-acted. The interaction between Amy and Bill is not only heartfelt and funny, but also sorrowful and heartbreaking. Her wacky tarot card psychic mother (Norma) seemed odd on the surface, but she had complicated legit thoughtful reasons to behave like that covering the truth  to protect her daughter. I came to love her character at the end as well. Ive actually met someone like her in terms of appearance and traits in real life in Los Angeles.

Im glad that Amys determination, perseverance and resilience eventually paid off (somewhat). She finally had some sort of closure and reconciliation of relationship with her father as well as her mother. BTW, the best acting & most realistic character is the V.A. doctor to me. He is incredibly real! This is a truly mesmerizing and moving story indeed. I highly recommend it.",1430179200,,1431,5.290748898678414
