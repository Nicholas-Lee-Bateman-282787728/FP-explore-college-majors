2725710,5,B000M5KA0I,The DVD set was delivered quickly and in excellent condition. I would be willing to buy from this seller again.,1178409600,,111,4.6
2725711,5,B000M5KA0I,"I originally approached this series with a great deal of trepidation, in spite of previous positive reviews.  Fantasy titles in anime tend to end up in two different categories.  There's the 'Plot? What Plot?' that meander endlessly and switch focus repeatedly, and then there's the 'Epic quest to save the world against the evil overlord/god' that gets so caught up in its storyline that the characters remain two dimensional stereotypes.

Characterization is where this series really shines.  The story centers around fifteen year old Pacifica Cassul and her siblings as they travel.  Pacifica herself usually comes across as incredibly spoiled and bratty, yet at the same time is tempered by her being very sweet and considerate.  These traits often hide the guilt she has buried deep within her for being the Scrapped Princess - the 'Poison that will destroy the world'- and for the pain and upheaval to people's lives she thinks she leaves in her wake.  Less time is given to her siblings - the oftentimes whimsical sister Raquel, and her taciturn brother Shannon, but they get plenty of screentime to explore their own motives.  The biggest surprise to me came in the form of Chris.  I had thought he would be a relatively minor and shallow antagonist, but his own path is explored well and I honestly think he had the best development of any character in the series.  The only problem with characters is that there are really too many side characters.  This leaves very little time to establish them and their motives.  The series probably would have been a little better of by limiting the supporting cast in favor of focusing on the main cast and plot.

The story starts well and proceeds at an even pace through the first two thirds of the series.  It never lets itself get mired too much in the seriousness of the plot that it bogs itself down by intermixing some comedy and the lighter sides of life.  It doesn't take this too far, however, never resorting to slapstick or cheap gags which would have almost definitely taken attention or effect from the action drama the story is meant to be.  The beginning caught my interest in that it is almost the complete inverse of the 'save the world' plot.  This kept me hooked long enough to become truly involved in the series.  About two thirds of the way through a plot twist puts a new spin on the story, but doesn't actually change the direction.  It gets a little bumpy here, as the story has to pause momentarily to setup the new aspects on the situation, but then picks up pace to the end.  This is where I was most worried about where the story was going.  Far too many anime series become rushed and chaotic at the end, and the terrible endings can spoil an entirely well done anime.  Scrapped Princess speeds up at the end, but never becomes too jumbled.  It wraps up most loose ends very well and then finishes up well, even managing to add in a short epilogue.

In between great characters, an interesting plot, and an excellent ending, Scrapped Princess has become one of my favorite series to date.",1174608000,28,3068,4.6809701492537314
2725712,5,B000M5KA0I,"I was hesitant about this series at first, but found it to be quite the opposite of what I expected.  The story is interesting with a mix of fantasy and sci-fi influences.  The voice acting is superb and alot better than with most animes out there.  The animation is clean and fluid, which is to be be expected from BONES (the studio that animated Wolf's Rain and Fullmetal Alchemist.)  I liked the sense of humor in this series; it was not all slapstick comedy that is rampant in anime.  My only gripe with this series is that it could have fleshed out some of the more important side charcters better.  Overall, I would recommend this series to anyone who likes a good story and a great ending.",1170806400,24,696,4.440944881889764

2725714,5,B000M5KA0I,"This anime started off kinda wierd to me, i didn't know if it was going  to be a modern day or old day anime, but it turned out to be both and that is a good thing. I got really into this anime on the second dvd. I saw the whole thing and i had no complaints, i liked it alot. If you have some extra cash and you want to spend it on some anime and don't know which one check this one out it has a great stoy theme.",1221868800,,414,3.5494505494505493
2725715,5,B000M5KA0I,"Let me just say this first, like a few other reviews out there I think that this is one of my favorite anime's of all time, and definently worth the buy. I bought it just looking for an anime to pass the time with, not really expecting anything, just maybe hoping to waste time I suppose. It blew me away. For one thing I could really relate to Pacific's character. Not that I am doomed to end the world or anything, but by the fact that I feel guilty about things that I have no control over, and I always feel like people are trying to protect me...or somthing. but the point is, is that it is filled with characters with real human emotion that you can relate to.
  At one point, kinda towards the end, I was begining to think ""huh, whats gonna happen now? were almost to the our destination, and there are still a good number of episodes left, whats gonna happen??"" ( I think of things in terms of video games somtimes in anime's like this) and then it happend!! I guess I shouldnt spoil it, but it took me by total surprise!! I was so worried that the characters would never see each other again, and then to bring in such a fantastic character towards the end and- Oh!!! I'll just tell you, I cried.....but then again, Im a sissy towards that kind of thing, I actually cried a few times...at varies places, but at that one particular instent, and then at the end...I cried good...if that makes any sense...I do wish, however, that it was just a smidgen longer, for Pacifica and Leo's sake....somthing could have developed there.",1216684800,,1534,4.397887323943662
2725716,5,B000M5KA0I,"Scrapped Princess has a great cast of characters and an interesting blend of magic and scifi. The dubbing is actually quite good and the voices aren't too childish, some of the phrasing will give you a chuckle though. The first couple disks of the series are amazing and action pack. On the  last couple disks though the action stalls a bit in favor of pulling the  heart strings a bit. The ending is good but feels rather abrupt and leaves you with a lot of questions.
Overall it's an awesome and enjoyable series and I highly recommend it to any Anime fans!",1212537600,,559,4.470588235294118
2725717,4,B000M5KA0I,"I was expecting something along the lines of Himiko-Den. The spoiler on the ads only cover the first disk or two. It gets much better. It turns Sci-fi as it goes and even has some interesting points to make. Not a real thinker's anime, but not kiddie anime either. It has a good story and the English translation is easy to follow and seems well done. A good and entertaining series if a little generic (other than the sci-fi). Some comedy and rommance, fan service. Overall a well rounded story and worth the price.",1207094400,,516,4.5
2725718,4,B000M5KA0I,"I cannot give away any spoilers!

This begins as a Rune Soldier-esque middle ages story but halfway through the viewer is fed a giant spoonfull of sci-fi, and the spoons keep getting bigger until the ending.

What I liked about this is that I watched it soon after NOEIN, and loved the similarities in various plot elements.  Plus, Crispin Freeman has become one of my favorite American voice actors, and I prefer the English dubs when he is one of the cast.

If you want any plot reviews look up others' reviews, but basically the story revolves around the 'scrapped princess' who is destined to cause the destruction of the world on her 16th birthday.  Her adopted siblings vow to protect her from virtually every person in the world since they all want her dead.  This is an amazing, underrated series that is a STEAL in the legends collection packaging.  Buy it and you will not be disappointed.

Pros: Animation, voice acting, plot, action, mystery, characterization
Cons: Really nothing except the goofy intro song =)

Viewing Preference: Both ways, though watch first in English for a few episodes before deciding.  Though some characters are great in English, others are great in Japanese.

Oh, and doesn't that Chris guy look a lot like Dominic from Eureka Seven...Oh, a lot of character also look like Saiyuki characters as well...but I don't think the same artists worked on any of these projects.",1206230400,,1408,4.849372384937238
2725719,3,B000M5KA0I,"I really liked this series a lot until the story suddenly changed from Fantasy to full-blown Sci-Fi. (This happens a little further than halfway through the series, if I remember correctly.) Because I loved the characters so much I decided to keep going, but after a couple eps I was about ready to give up on it. Luckily the story soon returns to more of a fantasy emphasis and I was able to finish it up with a fair amount of enjoyment. But unfortunately, it did not recover enough for me to keep the series in my collection.",1205539200,5,527,4.387755102040816
2725720,5,B000M5KA0I,"I just wanted to add my two cents to this.
Me and my wife are pretty die hard anime fans. But we are wicked picky too. This anime immediately made it into both of our top 5 animes to watch. A solid story line. Interesting, deep, cool characters. And they change the format of your typical anime too. they don't have a monster thing to fight every eppisode its believeable so you don't even think about it being fiction. lol but the point is its worth watching. Definately!",1202688000,,472,4.375
2725721,5,B000M5KA0I,"Scrapped Princess is an intriguing anime with many twists and turns. It held my interest all the way through, and I was more than satisfied with how things turned out by the end. Overall a great fantasy / adventure anime, and I highly recommend it!",1202428800,,248,4.533333333333333
2725722,5,B000M5KA0I,"It's hard to be intrigued by the title (Scrapped Princess), cover art, anime style, or believe the other reviews praising it merits.

However, these are times you should cast aside your doubts (if you have any), and dive into the world of Pacifica, Shannon, and Raquel.  Once you become ""hooked"" at whichever point in the story, it dawns on you how short this series feels; despite it being 24-episodes long.

One word that can describe the quality of the cast of characters is 'calm'.  Shannon, Raquel, and the various ""villains"" they eventually meet are always cool, collected, and convey their points of view in either direct or subtle ways without confusion.  If by chance something just flies by your head.  Don't worry.  All lingering questions are answered by the end.

Of course, the 'calm' is consistently afflicted by the torrent of emotions that is Pacifica.  Love her or hate her (you will swing like a pendulum on this one); her extroverted characteristics not only make you understand the 'calmer' cast better, but you will also sympathize with Pacifica throughout her ordeal.

I highly recommend this series for any Anime fan to add to their collection.  Or perhaps if this is an introduction to Japanimation, it will shake your believes that all Anime involves: one-dimensional characters, fan-service, mechas, or somebody who wields a katana.

Probably as an interesting tidbit, I would add one interesting fact:  Whenever I see a Chrysler Pacifica on the road, I can't help but be reminded of this series.  Even to the point where I would actually think of purchasing one, just to paint a smiling silhouette of the Scrapped Princess on the car as a tribute.",1202342400,,1675,4.935714285714286
2725723,4,B000M5KA0I,"This has been one on my list for a while. I ran out of items that I considered higher priority and bought this not expecting too much.

Was I wrong!

The story is told very well... and though it is medieval in its appearance it is filled with creative technology.

In addition the classic argument that can be seen in Shirow Masamune's ""Appleseed"" (and many others) is delivered in a new package, but not really seen in new light.

Is it better to live in ignorance inside the safety of a gilded cage or be free even at the cost of your own destruction?

This take on this age old question is delightful.

The characters have meaningful relationships with each other. The relationships are contrasted with the backstories of the subordinate characters who want this kind of special relationship but can only enjoy/experience it by being associated with the Scrapped-Princess and her guardians.

A story of love, but not a story of lovers. More of a story about someone very special and that person's protectors.

You could compare the relationships to that of Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in the cult classic by Luc Besson ""The Professional"". The relationships are not sexual but they ARE Powerful and leave you aching when the story is over... like saying good bye to friends.

(Yes, yes... the directors cut of ""The Professional"" was a little more suggestive... but it still wasn't a sexual relationship.)

All and all this collection is a keeper.

I gave it 4 stars in stead of 5 because the episodes seemed a bit short and the artwork seemed clean but flat (we need more Haruhiko Mikimoto types out there). We burned through the entire set in a few evenings over dinner.

This is short and sweet but very satisfying.",1201564800,3,1721,4.7
2725724,2,B000M5KA0I,"I rented the first disc(ep. 1-4)and after watching it I then bought this collection at a great price. I thought the first 6 episodes of Scrapped Princess was really fun. It had a little bit of action, interesting characters and moved pretty quickly. I mean the story rarely fooled around. Then something happened. The characters stopped growing, the fun left and the story took on some kind of matrix feel. The cool side characters left and in came in my opinion dull and boring characters. It was like someone started the story and then gave it to someone else after episode 6. It got to a point where I really didn't care what happened to the characters (and the story) after episode 12. Anyway it looks like I'm in the minority here but I felt I needed to put up my opposing view so as too keep the rating honest. Just my opinion like everyone else.",1201392000,10,852,4.467948717948718
2725725,5,B000M5KA0I,"Scrapped Princess is one of my favorite anime series. Yes, as people have complained, it is fairly short- 24 episodes- but that means they have to keep it moving. Something's always HAPPENING. There's no long pointless timekiller episodes, and hardly any long talky angsty monologues that some animes so enjoy (hallelujah). Pacifica seems to be the only one with any real angst, and she's more the type to yell than whine.
 The voice actors on SP are fantastic- Crispin Freeman and Kari Walhgren (who became Hagi and Saya/Diva in the english dub of Blood+) are two of the main characters, and they are incredible.
 This is a wonderful series. I can't recommend it highly enough.",1195776000,,678,4.886956521739131
2725726,4,B000M5KA0I,"At first glance this might appear somewhat of a silly anime...I watched Erementar Gerad before this one..so I was bit reluctant to try something else out thinking I would be disappointed like I was with EG...fortunately I'm a bit more open minded so I gave it shot. I must say I was glad I did. The story line and the characters are very likable and you'll get hooked by episode 5 at least. There isn't any great fighting scenes, so if you're expecting that, forget it. It's meant to be a somewhat drama/comedic type anime and it achieves that well. The voice acting in English and Japanese are well done as is the animation quality. Music lacks a bit, with the same ending (which is pretty good) and opening(which I couldn't stand) songs. A solid 4 anime. Recommended. Has some blood and violence, but nothing to say ""ehhh..looks painful"" a bit of fan service. Ok for 12 and up.",1195171200,,879,4.534591194968553
2725727,4,B000M5KA0I,"Scrapped Princess is one of those series that's simply enjoyable to watch from start to finish. The main characters are all likeable (a huge plus for an anime very focused on the central characters), the plot is great and the music is good... There's not much more you can ask for out of an anime, is there?

The problem? The R1 Scrapped Princess DVD's. For whatever reason, nearly all the episodes suffer from serious dot crawl and shimmering/rainbowing issues that would really ruin the visuals for anyone watching on a HDTV/LCD monitor. The episodes suffering from dot crawl are easy to spot since the title shows at its worst right at the start and you can't really miss the shimmering/rainbowing. I hoped these issues would only exist on the first 2 episodes after they vanished on episodes 3 and 4, but the issues are there in the vast majority of the episodes.

The R4 (Aussie) DVD's don't show the dotcrawl and shimmering/rainbowing issues anywhere near as much, so it's rather shocking the R1 releases were allowed to be sold without these issues being worked out as much as possible.

I'm giving this a 4/5 because the series itself is excellent and this set is VERY cheap for what's included. My rating would be 2-3/5 if it was for the individual volumes due to how bad the video quality is.",1194480000,,1302,4.676855895196507
2725728,5,B000M5KA0I,"I have been pleasantly surprised by this series. Superficially, it is drawn and animated well, a colorful pleasure to look at. The music is fitting for the fantasy-medieval genre, and the Japanese voice acting is great (I prefer  Japanese over English dubs so I can't vouch for the quality of the English). Overall, it is quality one would expect from BONES, the studio that brought us ""Wolf's Rain"" and ""Fullmetal Alchemist"".

The plot begins firmly  in fantasy with magical elements, elements that we slowly come to realize are rooted in advanced technology that was lost in a past ""apocalyptic"" war. This introduction of a sci-fi element is gradual and not jarring, adding an entire level to the series that most do not expect.

The story itself is never too heavy or serious - lighter than ""Fullmetal Alchemist"", with plenty of sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek humour that is never slapstick or over-the-top. A fine balance not often found in anime. This crosses over to the characters, too, who are immediately three-dimensional, never what one would initially expect. Characters I thought I'd hate when I first saw them later became my favorites. There are few stereotypes within the main character group.

The adventure is good and never repetitious, the episodes never drag, and the series takes advantage of its 24 episodes where other series feel they could of been cut shorter or feel crammed in that number of eps. ""Scrapped Princess"" doesn't try to be anything fantastic, and indeed, no particular element really leaps out of this anime, but its all-around solid, good quality makes it a wonderful series that I'm glad to own. I think it is this quality that FINALLY got my ""anime-hating"" sister to sit down and try some good anime for once - and she likes it. ;)

As for the product itself, this boxed set is solidly produced in a hard-plastic multi-disc box that nicely protects the discs. It is indeed the entire series, 24 episodes, in both Japanese and English languages with optional English subtitles. Definetly a good deal for the money.",1192665600,2,2055,4.942028985507246
2725729,5,B000M5KA0I,"OMG! I loved this series! At first I was skeptical because the first few episodes are a tad weird and make you hate the main character, Pacifica, because she starts out rather obnoxious.  However, once you get into the story, you get sucked right in. I ended up watching the entire series in one day!
I give this anime two enthusiastic thumbs up! (Because two is all I have... *sigh* Why can't I be like Lucy in Elfen Lied??? Then I'd get four more hands AND I'd have awesome horns!)

You get an incredible sense of human emotion from the characters, and they are all very interesting.

The Scrapped Princess is said to be born under a cursed star and bring destruction to the entire world. Nearly the entire world is out to kill her. There is nowhere they can hide, so they stay on the move. Shannon is a talented swordsman, and Raquel is a strong sorceress. Pacifica has very good protectors. At first glance, Pacifica tends to seem like a spoiled brat. Sometimes she makes a complete turnaround and shows a sweet and caring attitude. It's kind of wierd how she changes like that. The 3 siblings will meet many people on their journey. Some will become friends and others will betray them. One thing is for sure; there will be lots of action and plot twists.

This series is pretty good. It has a good mix of action, comedy and drama. There are some really good characters that are developed well. This series stays focused on the main plot and doesn't diverge like a lot of the fantasy animes out there. It has good animation, voice acting, and a decent soundtrack. I really enjoyed it, but there are tons of better shows out there. I'll give it 4 stars, because even though I enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.",1356480000,,1279,4.560869565217391

But as for Princess Pacifica...I'm afraid there were too many times when I wanted nothing more than to see someone smack her and put her in her place.  (*SPOILER*) That actually does happen one time when her brother Shannon smacks her for being mean to a little girl, and I practically cheered out loud when he did that!  LOL  Believe me, after hearing her whine and seeing how selfish she is with food, you will, too.  What also annoyed me about her was that later, there is an aspiring red headed knight who likes her and the entire time, she can only act like she's better than him, even at the end.  I was disgusted with her, really.  Good thing the other characters made up for it, though it annoyed me how they all acted like she was the most important person alive.  As for the acting, it was pretty good.  The storyline was interesting, as well, and contrary to another review on here, I actually liked the mix of fantasy and sci-fi together.  It only made the story more interesting.  I guess, when I watch an anime, I don't see it on a fantasy or sci-fi or romance level as it's all the same to me.

8166675,5,B000M5KA0I,"I ended up buying this at an anime convention a few years ago because it had gone on ""Sunday Sale"" for $25 and I had seen artwork for the series and liked it. I think it's probably the best $25 I have ever spent.

I was so enthralled by the story and the gorgeous animation that I had the entire series finished in two days and re-watched it again the next week.

The plot follows Pacifica Cassul, the titular scrapped princess whose birth foretold the end of the world, and her two adoptive siblings and they travel the countryside trying to avoid assassins and religious crazies trying to kill her before her 16th birthday.

The series starts off as high fantasy, but takes a twist that totally changes the genre to sci-fi about a third of the way through. Each episode seemed to bring about some sort of twist to the story that added to the plot and really gave this title great substance.

I enjoyed that the first three-quarters of the series had nice dramatic elements laced with bits of comedy to help keep the plot from getting too heavy. The last quarter dropped quite a bit of the humor (but not all) and mostly concentrated on the drama and action. I was close to tears quite a few times during those last few episodes.

The English dubbing was quite good and I managed to get all the way through it without switching to the Japanese tracks with subtitles.

Definitely a great buy whether you're into mecha, magical girl or heroic adventure anime genres =)",1268179200,,1467,4.496240601503759
8166676,5,B000M5KA0I,"Well, if a stranger had told me that an excellent anime series could be made that combines the renaissance time period with a sci-fi theme...I would have vaporized him with my phaser.

Fortunately for the stranger on the street, he would be right in this case. Scrapped Princess offers a middle-age time period anime (with excellent music to match) yet it has a sci-fi spin that grows as the series progresses. The emphasis on this case is on character development and a well-thought out plot that keeps you guessing the whole way through.

Several animes, which I will refrain from mentioning, have a tendency to go all out on the main characters special abilities in order to immediately ""wow"" the viewer. Unfortunately this tactic will eventually fail as everyone will grow weary of the hype. In order for true character development to work you have to have build-up and meaning - Scrapped Princess had this fine tuned to near perfection.

If I were to give this series one flaw it would be that the ending is a tad too short. But this is a minor criticism as I found the epilogue adequate...but not perfect.

Most viewers will find themselves hooked by episode 4. If you're not..then odds are you probably will not like the series.

No filler episodes...which is always a plus

I thought this would be any other fantasy anime that's out there, but I'm glad to say that I was surprised by this anime--more animes should be like this.
  Pacifica Casstul's life is a rough one and for good reason--she's fated to destroy the world according to St. Grendel when she's 16 years old.  Her father, the king, threw her out and ordered her murdered to prevent her from destroying the world.  However, she survives and has an adopted brother and sister to look after her.

Overall it is not a very new concept, but the anime is well drawn and it was easy for me to get into the characters.  It is a fairly good mix of fantasy, drama, sci-fi, and comedy so it can attract a wider group of people than some of the more single minded animes.  Also it is not to violent for children and I think the writers did keep that in mind.  I gave this anime four stars and I really enjoyed watching it.",1242691200,,588,4.0
