4048163,5,B003156IHU,"I just have to add a comment about this thoroughly enjoyable film:  Yes, everyone was great and well chosen for their parts, but the one that really got to me was Margaret Wycherly playing the mother of the man William Powell was being led to believe he was....I think that's how it went.  Ha! Ha!  I only caught the last part of the film and while I like twists and turns, sometimes they can be a little hard to follow, as in the Maltese Falcon.  Whew!
Back to Wycherly, from the moment she opens her door to Powell she has me captivated.  I can't figure out what she is up to if anything, but I can't take my eyes off her face.  (This is the same face we see in White Heat and the Yearling) She nearly convinces me that she is very old and frail, probably in her nineties.  She appears fearful of Powell and just wants him to leave because she's a helpless old lady.  Then, later, we find out she's actually part of the plot as she reveals a much younger, fairly energetic woman!  She's a hoot!",1407715200,5,996,4.2
4048164,4,B003156IHU,"Crossroads is playing with identity. Diplomat Powell can't remember (amnesia) who he was in the past.
There is evidence he could be a crook. Powell and Lamarr (his wife) try to solve this mystery. Not always

4048165,4,B003156IHU,"William Powell rarely had opportunity to play fretful, used as we are to seeing him onscreen in full mastery of the situation. In CROSSROADS, MGM's 1942 above-average whodunit, he plays French diplomat David Talbot with his trademark unflappable charm. Except that Talbot's poise crumbles some when he's accused of once being the murderer Jean Pelletier. And the gist of the premise posits that, yes, he very well could be.

David Talbot is an amnesiac who thirteen years ago suffered a debilitating blow to the head. He has no recall of his life before the injury, had no choice but to forge a new life for himself. Today, in 1935, Paris, ""David Talbot"" sits on top of the world, celebrating three blissful months of marriage to his stunning wife Lucienne (Hedy Lamarr) and soon to be , perhaps, France's new ambassador to Brazil. What better time then for them blackmailers to make their move?

Is it a band of mercenary hooligans taking advantage of an amnesiac? Or is the amnesiac pulling a fast one? CROSSROADS deals in trickeration. It establishes an unsettling atmosphere. The narrative discombobulates the viewer as much as it does its protagonist. It propels the concept of mistaken identity with such relentlessness that our guy David Talbot starts second guessing his blank slate of a past. Powell invests his role with an urgency that eventually transitions into this sense of horrified acceptance. In a smart move Powell also rapidly forsakes his vague attempt at a French accent.

Hedy Lamarr is so beautiful except that her acting has often been maligned. I think she sparkles as Powell's wife, adoring and lively and resourceful. Maybe Powell's innate poise and grace allowed her to be more at ease and, therefore, more natural. She certainly wasn't averse to another pairing up in the following year's comedy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/THE-HEAVENLY-BODY/dp/B003156IJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">THE HEAVENLY BODY</a>. I love her romantic and comic interludes with Powell.

""So you're going to bluff your way out of this,"" sneers the sinister extortionist Henri Sarrou (Basil Rathbone) after David Talbot dismisses his demand of one million francs. Predictably, Rathbone makes for a menacing yet elegant big bad. Claire Trevor steps in as Sarrou's accomplice (and Talbot's alleged mistress) and gets to sing the nightclub torch song ""`Til You Return."" You identify Sarrou and his chanteuse for the bad eggs that they are. It doesn't mean they're lying. The body of proof piles up against David Talbot's denials: an incriminating locket photo, a scar on Talbot's hand, a worn-down old lady (an excellent Margaret Wycherly) who may be his forgotten mother. CROSSROADS keeps you guessing. Its final fifteen minutes alone offer up several plot reverses. Can David Talbot keep his head above water? Or is he in on the hoax? Why don't you find out?",1359244800,2,2906,5.269978401727862
4048166,4,B003156IHU,"This is a Very Good Movie, that I had never seen before. William Powell as always is Excellent. There is a very good supporting cast, including, Hedy Lamarr, Basil Rathbone, Claire Trevor, and Felix Bressard. A good mystery, akin too Film Noir. It is Not in my humble opinion, a great movie, it is a good movie. Maybe, aptly described, as a, Good Old Good One. This is a WB Archive Collection Disc, made on demand. It is NOT Remastered. The Quality is good.",1350518400,7,457,4.4523809523809526

Directed by Jack Conway

Diplomat David Talbot (William Powell) and his bride Lucienne (Hedy Lamarr) are enjoying a honeymoon in Paris when David is confronted by extortionists who demand money in exchange for not turning him in to the police. David has no idea what the men are talking about and ignores their threats, but the men prove good to their word, and David finds himself on trial for a series of thefts. At the trial, David's name is cleared when Henri Sarrow (Basil Rathbone) testifies that he knew the man who committed the crimes, a friend of his who recently died.

However, after the trial, David meets Sarrow, who informs David that he lied under oath; according to Sarrow, David did indeed commit the robberies while suffering from amnesia after a severe blow to the head, and if he wants to keep the facts quiet, he'll do whatever Sarrow says.

This is some Classic stuff with a fabulous cast!  Doesn't get any better than this for ""whodunits""

4048168,3,B003156IHU,"While I really like both Hedy Lamarr and William Powell, this film is not a great use of their talents.  Powell is a much better comedic actor and you find yourself looking for more of his charm and wit, but not much is there in this movie.  Lamarr is most famous for looking great but also was a pretty good actress.  Here she has little to do with her part and aside from a couple scenes, they have her with some goofy hairstyles that don't do her justice.  Rathbone and Trevor are both very good as villians here and keep the film from being any worse.  Also Felix Breshart is always good to see, but his comedic skills like Powell are muted with the screenplay.  See The Heavenly Body for a better pairing of Powell & Lamarr.",1310688000,7,729,4.2846715328467155
4048169,5,B003156IHU,"Of the all the Lamarr/Powell pairings, this is the best one I've seen. This film was very good, establishing the security of the relationship and life shared by the couple, and then the complete turmoil that is created when he is accused of crimes he cannot remember. All the actors were perfectly cast, each with a flawless understanding of their role. Hedy is of course the same treat she always is, and the reason I watched it. Its one of her good dramas, and great performances. Watch it.",1290556800,21,492,4.6022727272727275

Twist in the plot carried flawlessly by Powell. Worth the black and white photography. Excellent story. Just when you think you have unscrambled the dilemma, William Powell turns the tables. Highly recommend for old movie buffs who like to have a plot that doesn't involve CGI, space aliens or destructive car chases. This movie has all the drama and emotion that satisfied the imagination with a mystery, in a well designed plot.",1410912000,7,599,4.882352941176471
