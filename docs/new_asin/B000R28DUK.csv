8304669,5,B000R28DUK,"Seeking for further titles within the sections of East Asian art cinema (and these categories have always been, as I see it, way more receptive to sexual depictions - in their beauty, not in their explicitiness! - than the 'Western sphere' (again a notion which would require clarification...), I stumbled over reviews of 'Colour Blossoms'. It turned out they were at best well-meaning, it seemed as no one (or hardly anyone) was excited about the film, but many admitted that the film was powerful in its design, its colorful takes and scenes. Well, in many East Asian works of art cinema, the picture is more important than a consistent story line, and do I decided to give the film a chance.

And I have not regretted one single minute of my time I devoted to this work. Admittedly: the storyline is full of cuts and gaps, starts without any explanations, and it is the spectator's hard work to figure out how the scenes are related. Ony in the end the character played by the immensely enchanting Harisu (who, it turns out, is more a femme fatale, even a Venus Flytrap, than anyhing else, but exactly this makes her so brilliant) explain how the filmic takes together form a plot. This film is about the changing, altering, manipulated and manipulating, all in all: the trans-gendered and hence transitioning body. It gives the transgender a voice, introducing him or her to the potential of desiring. Between colorful impressios of blue, yellow, and red, these raptures are just logical, and they eventually contribute to the filmic pleasure for the spectator.

Take you time for this film, allow yourself to think, and to desire, and then you may love it (it still remains a question of taste).",1253404800,,1700,4.798634812286689
