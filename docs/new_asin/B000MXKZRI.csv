8362046,1,B000MXKZRI,Turns out the type of DVD player used in the USA is different from the UK version and cannot be played on an American DVD player.  My Dad was very sad to learn this when this DVD was delivered to him as he loves trains and wanted to see some of the sights I had seen when visiting Norway.,1402444800,,288,3.8813559322033897
