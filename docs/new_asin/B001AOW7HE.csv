8278434,3,B001AOW7HE,"Like the first reviewer said, the quality of these DVDs is mediocre. In the Paris episode, she passed by many interesting sites, but she didn't actually go in. She passed by the Notre Dame, Louvre, Picasso Museum, Arc De Triomphe, and Eiffel Tower. She also went to an artificial beach along the River Seine and Montmarte, which is a bohemian part of town. She went to a Ferris wheel at the Tuileries (I had to look up the correct spelling on Wikipedia). She briefly went to Moulin Rouge, which was tamer than I expected, but this felt like a rushed episode. She wasted 3 minutes trying to get the automatic flush on a public toilet to work. That's something I would've expected from Samantha Brown. SMH...

In London, she stopped by Trafalgar Square, the Tower of London, the Tower Bridge (not to be confused with London Bridge), and the Changing of the Guard ceremony. Although she encouraged viewers to get a Museum Pass, she did not mention the Tube (though she briefly mentioned the double decker buses).

In Amsterdam, she rode a boat on a canal. Amsterdam also had trams, ""coffee shops"", and a red light district. I noticed that Laura talks too fast. Laura mentioned that people would discard old bikes in canals. Really? Why not give them to poor kids in Africa? She took a side trip to Volendam, where residents wear traditional Dutch clothing and Edam, which is a farm where they make cheese.

In Rome, she visited the Spanish steps, piazza, Vatican, Pantheon, and Colosseum. Rome isn't really my favorite city.

In Athens, she visited Syntagma Square, which is the center of town and where they have a changing of the guards ceremony. She briefly rode the Athens Metro before visiting the Acropolis, which was encased in scaffolding. She brought her daughter along for this trip (and for the trip to Paris).

In Prague, she visited the 600 year old Charles Bridge, the Prague Castle, and the Changing of the Guards ceremony, where Laura annoyed a guard. Afterwards, she rode a tram through town.

She covers a few places that Rick Steves and Rudy Maxa don't cover, but overall, this is inferior in comparison to Rick and Rudy, though I'd rank her above Samantha Brown.",1408579200,4,2179,4.736147757255937
8278435,3,B001AOW7HE,"First, the good news about this 6 hour set of European videos on 3 DVDs. The videography is pretty good, the videos were made recently (2006 to 2007) so it's up to date, and this set is obviously very cheap. But in my opinion, the cons outweigh the pros.

This video set has a number of flaws. The first problem is the host Laura McKenzie herself. While she has been making travel videos for many years, she still comes across as someone who doesn't know much about the cities she is covering. The videos are very superficial, covering only a few basics of each city. She also gets easily distracted on irrelevant topics. For example, in the Paris episode, which is only 20 minutes long, she spent 3 minutes trying to figure out how one of Paris's automatic public toilets work. Yet she completely ignores many of the more interesting tourist attractions in Paris.

If you already own a complete set of European videos by Rick Steves, Rudy Maxa, or Samantha Brown, don't buy this set by Laura McKenzie. It doesn't add anything to the videos you already have.

If you don't own any European videos, and you want to buy a set of videos that give you an overview of Europe at a low price, then you might consider buying this set. However, since this set only has about 15 videos, I think that a better value for your money is to buy a set by Rick Steves called ""Rick Steves Europe All 43 Shows 2000 - 2005"" which not only has almost triple the number of videos as the Laura McKenzie set, but is also much better made. The good news is that since the Rick Steves set is a few years old, it sells on Amazon at a discount. It's usually only a few dollars more than this set. I suggest buying the Rick Steves set instead.

If you are willing to spend the money to get the most complete set of European videos you can buy, pick up Rick Steves newest set ""Rick Steves Europe All 90 Shows"" which has all his shows from 2000 - 2012. (Yes, I realize I'm writing this review in 2011, but his box set claims to be from 2000 - 2012.)

In case you are wondering exactly what is covered in this Laura McKenzie set, here is the list:

1st DVD - London, English Countryside, Dublin, Ireland, Edinburgh, Scottish Countryside

2nd DVD - Rome, Naples, Venice, Amalfi Coast, Italian Countryside

3rd DVD - Paris, Amsterdam, Prague, Athens, Greek Islands",1314403200,9,2330,4.414918414918415
