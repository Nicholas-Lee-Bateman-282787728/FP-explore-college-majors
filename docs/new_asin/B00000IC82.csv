7910469,3,B00000IC82,"this as you all know is their last film they ever did, in 1951. It is worth buying - if you're a huge fan of Laurel and Hardy (like me) then do buy this on dvd to complete your collection..also it's memorable considering it is their final movie. However, I do feel that it would have been a better farewell if this movie had never been made, especially during such a terrible time for our heroes. Neither of them were in any condition to make a film the way the were and it shows significantly in this. Stan was almost skin and bone and Ollie was obese. It's really not a good way to remember these 2 comedy legends.. The actual story itself is quite decent and you are quite drawn to it once it gets going, plus the fact that (even when they were unwell) still managed to make us laugh a few times during the film which shows what committed actors they are. But still, it was terrible timing for the. Another thing that was almost intolerable was that they couldn't even be bothered to get English speaking actors, and so we have to be forced to watch badly dubbed English voiceovers...along with terrible picture and sound quality. It just wasn't a well organized film, - (yes it was filmed in France) but they should have at least let the 'moving/speaking mouths' go with the correct voices.

Overall for me, knowing that Stan in particular was in quite a bit of pain whilst filming, just puts me off liking it. You can even hear it in his voice. I was glad to see that he still managed to live 14 years after the movie was made, but still it was probably the worst possible time to have filmed it really. Either 'The Bullfighters' should've been their last movie, or simply filmed 'atoll k/Utopia' in around 1946-1948 time...before the boys got in the state they were here.

As for the other one, the Flying Deuces, I found this to be an average laurel and Hardy film. It was quite funny in some parts but not their greatest either. Still, it's not as bad as 'Twice Two', 'The Chimp' or their last one they did here..it's about Hardy falling in love with a French girl...(won't go into the full story of it). This one was made in 1939 and isn't included in the large Hal roach collection. There are 12/13 sound movies which are on single DVDs..
'The flying Deuces' isn't too bad, just not an ultimate classic.

But anyway, Do buy if you're a fan! I'm not saying it's terrible, just that it was gutting to see them like this in their final film. It does still contain the odd laugh and shows that they can be funny no matter what condition they're in. But although it is worth watching and not a bad film per say, it is the worst one they've ever done for the reasons I have explained. RIP l&H

Hope this helped!",1436659200,,2715,4.349112426035503
7910470,4,B00000IC82,"After being re-packaged to death on the video market, the films ""Flying Deuces"" (1939) and ""Utopia"" (1950) are presented once again by Madacy Records. Here, Madacy does a competent--if unremarkable job--of presenting the films. The bare-boned caricatures of Laurel & Hardy on the DVD menu are cute, but they could've at least added some production notes on the making of the 2 films.
First up: ""Flying Deuces"", a movie the boys made away from Hal Roach for RKO Radio. A near-classic, the film is very hit-and-miss in story & execution. Ollie, jilted by his objection of affection & deeply heartbroken, decides to commit suicide by throwing himself into a watery grave. Enlisting the help of his pal Stan (this is help??), they are spared at the last minute by a Foreign Legion officer who suggests that they ""forget their troubles"" by joining. The boys mindlessly take him up on his offer. Once there, the boys get their eyes opened--it's certainly not a life of fun & relaxation they imagined, and of course, their bumbling immediately raises the ire of the commanding officer. Highlights include: Laurel playing a prison bed spring as a harp; a frenzied jail break (with a Keystone Kop-like look to it); the boys punished by doing a mountain of laundry (and accidentally burning the clothes); and the climactic getaway in the form of a wild plane ride. The film closes with one of the strangest L&H gags: Laurel survives the plane crash, but Hardy returns re-incarnated as a horse! James Finlayson, that mustachioed master of the double-take & slow burn (""doh!"") from L&H films past, is borrowed for RKO. His presence is very welcome to the film, but he's done better work in other L&H movies.
""Utopia"" is the infamous L&H film that everyone would love to forget. The production of the movie was a nightmare for its 2 stars. The European crew was multi-lingual, resulting in countless communication problems. Worse yet, was the appalling physical appearance of Stan & Ollie: Ollie had dangerously ballooned to almost twice his weight, while Stan had lost a great deal of it, looking haggard & far older than the years before his death. They had become mockish fun-house mirror reflections of themselves.
The story centers solely on the boys as they come into an inheritance. But taxation laws whittle their inheritance down to a small island, which they plan to live out their remaining years in joyous relaxation. Naturally, enroute, things go wrong: the boat's engine conks out, they discover they have stowaways, and a huge storm blows them off course to a newly-formed island. With their new friends, they almost immediately set up a small, independent republic. But strangers discover uranium deposits on the new ""Atoll K"", and soon, the island is over-run by people from all corners of the globe. The boys escape a mutiny by hanging just in time as another storm sinks the Atoll back to its watery depths.
As much a mess as this production was, it really doesn't deserve the oblivion it was hurled into. Compared to the 1940's features they did, this film was a worthier effort to do something different, especially in its political overtones. Like the best L&H features, there are no banal romantic subplots or musical numbers getting in the way (with the exception of the plot taking time to introduce each supporting character). The gags are often bizarre & offbeat, seemingly more akin to Buster Keaton's work. Highlights include: Stan & Ollie's bumbling attempts to set sail (and later, fix the engine); a funny breakfast bit as a stowaway keeps stealing Stan's food; Stan chasing a bat out the porthole--only to have several of the bat's friends enter; Stan burbing his pet lobster; and a charming dialogue exchange as Ollie chooses his cabinet post members, but leaves out Stan:
  Stan (whimpering): But what about me, Ollie?
  Ollie: Why Stan, you're THE PEOPLE!
In spite of fans & critics cringing at this film, the boys handled themselves quite well here in both comedy & character, and proved that though they were both quite ill, they could still shine.
This double feature, in my opinion, is a mixed bag, but worth looking at.",1188000000,,4147,4.903133903133903
7910471,3,B00000IC82,"This is a mixed bag from L&H. Being that it's probably in the Public Domain, ""Flying Deuces"" is all over the place on DVD and when I was a kid in the 70s, it showed up a lot on TV.
This was a pretty good film. The other reviewers have discussed the plot, so I won't go there. Not up to the (sadly) seldom seen ""Pardon Us"" or ""Pack Up Your Troubles,"" but a good time-killer. There is an oddly moving scene where Ollie tries to talk Stan into joining him in a foiled suicide effort by saying, ""What will you do? Without me, people will stare at you and wonder what you are."" Stan cries without going into his usual whiny shtick. This leaves a bizzare, but touching aftertaste. Then there's the famous ""Shine On Harvest Moon Sequence."" This scene, like much of the movie, doesn't exactly cause you to bust a gut and slap your knees, but it does make you smile.
Utopia is another matter. This is a really strange story about L&H inheriting an island and trying to start their own society with a group of castaways. The only reason anyone needs to see it is so that they could say they saw the last L&H film. I tried to watch this one 4 times before I could get all the way through without falling asleep. Peee-ooey. What a sad way to go.",1074643200,,1233,4.206751054852321
7910472,2,B00000IC82,i have been a fan of laurel and hardy for well over 50 years...it was and is sad to see the most beloved comics go out the way they did in their last movie...stan looked really bad since he was just recovering from illness...but nevertheless...i think all true laurel and hardy fans should own this dvd as a tribute to two of the greatest comdians that ever lived...thank youpatrick,1042588800,,382,4.550724637681159
7910473,2,B00000IC82,"This DVD produced by (shudder) Madacy offers a very good Laurel and Hardy film (""Flying Deuces"") with a very, very poor one (""Utopia"", AKA ""Atoll K""). Bad picture quality (with compression) is evident on both films, along with wafer thin sound.
The extras are typical of Madacy. There's a trivia game, filmography, and some biographies.
All in all, you should stay away from this to find a better transfer of 'Flying Deuces.'",1031961600,,425,4.916666666666667
7910474,4,B00000IC82,I bought this movie for my mom who loves Laural and Hardy.  She just loved it.  I recommended it to anyone who loves a good wholesome funny movie.,1030579200,,146,4.178571428571429
7910475,3,B00000IC82,"Although I am a big Laurel and Hardy fan I will be totally honest about this dvd. In a way I am glad to have these two films on dvd. The quality on the two films do differ. However I feel that the version of Utopia is far superior than the version that was available on video tape. The version of The Flying Deuces is not bad, but it is out of sync. Both versions are complete american versions(the european version of Utopia is longer than the american version) but until that version is available this will sufice. Granted Utopia all around is generally a bad film, but compared to their 1940-1945 films at MGM and 20th Century Fox where they had no say or control on the films they were making, it in a way shows some of thier old style and gags from their Hal Roach films. Stan Laurel was very ill during production and it definitely shows in his appearance and he later regretted completing this film. Today I am glad, as I am sure many people are ,that he at least was able to finish the film. In closing until better versions become available this dvd even though far from perfect is still ok.",987897600,7,1100,4.293269230769231
7910476,4,B00000IC82,"The dvd is fairly good.  The picture still looks like a film but the sound for the Flying Dueces is fantastic.  But, the sound for Utopia is bad.  I have surround sound and it is really to loud, I can't seem to adjust it to  a good point.  The trivia games are fun and there are two short biographies  that go along with each film.  It is pretty good and isn't that expensive.",961459200,6,376,4.068493150684931
