1273258,5,B00003CXRO,"Of all the great movies I've seen this year, Cast Away is easily the best. There are so many little touches that it will take multiple viewings to catch them all, and maybe a lifetime to understand them. The casual mood of the film, with hardly any dialog or music, bring alive the sense of aloneness and loss of being a lone castaway on a deserted island. There is a good chance that Tom Hanks will win yet another Oscar for Best Actor, because this is his best work ever. He literally has to carry the entire film by himself, and he does it perfectly.",977529600,,553,4.276190476190476
1273259,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away was a pretty good movie. Tom Hanks is a great star and did well in his role. Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a time obessesed FedEx executive who travels all around the world delviering mail. Helen Hunt plays his girlfriend, Kelly. But as you probably know, Noland's plane crashes in the middle of the pacific and he is the loan survivor. This is what you get from the trailer but although its a good movie, what I didn't like about it dragged it down. What Cast Away needed was a more focused beginning, and a less focused and drawn out ending. What we needed more of in the pre-island scenes was more time to show Noland's character a little more in depth and what his life is like so we could see him transform from that to what he becomes on the island. Then the island part of the movie. This of course was the best part. But in this part we don't get enough time to see Noland completly transform. We see him there for maybe a month and then cut to 4 years later where he is transformed. We needed more time on the island to show all the stages of what happened to him. And finally the ending scenes. This is where Noland must re-enter his life after being gone. We didn't need such a long and drawn out end. Some of the scenes were ok but some we didn't need. The film just randomly ends. Please don't get me wrong though, the flaws of the film are made up on the island scenes. The film features a different kind of acting task, since the island scenes lack a lot of dialogue. If you are a Hanks fan or fan of these types of movies you should see it. But I can't say I was amazed with it, but I can't say I hated it either. With a little work in the flawed areas this could have been 5 star quality. Oh and by the way I didn't like that fact that the previews gave away how long Noland was missing for. Rated PG-13 for violent and startling sequences.",977529600,,1863,4.134986225895317
1273260,4,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks is simply amazing.  Director Robert Zemeckis(Forrest Gump) and Hanks have combined again and succeeded again.
The film opens with Hanks, a Federal Express employee, in Russia drilling the Fed Ex employees there about better time management.  His job for Fed Ex apparently takes him all over the place and leaves little time for his girlfriend played by Helen Hunt.  Another assignment takes him off and while trying to avoid a storm the plane crashes.  This is where the movie really gets going.  Hanks lands on an island and finds himself completely alone.  This turns out to be quite a compelling character study as he tackles the most basic of needs while trying to keep hope.  Four years pass and Hanks is still there and he finally decides to leave.  Unfortunatly as the previews showed us he makes it and then...
Since Zemeckis decided to let the audience know ahead of time that Hanks is saved the only real suspense is whether or not he will get Hunt back.  This does not really matter because the film is good one way or another.  Hanks is brilliant.  Very few actors could tackle a project like this and still keep it interesting and engaging, especially for as long as he does in this film.  The island is definatly the best part of this movie and the rest is not as compelling.  However it is a fantastic character study and one of the best films of the year.",977443200,7,1381,4.565040650406504
1273261,5,B00003CXRO,"After seeing this film my first thought at the end of the movie was, ""thats it"". I thought it could have been a little longer to tell a better story. I'm not sure if it was the lack of dialog in the movie, or if my expectations were to high, but I was a little disappointed. I thought it could of been much better. Now, I'm not saying the movie is bad, its far from it, I'm just saying I was hoping for more. Tom Hanks gives an oscar worthy presentation once again, and its basically just him throughout the whole movie. I think that if film makers weren't constricted to how long they could make a movie, I think this would have been twice as long, that way they could of told a much better, in depth story. It felt like they cut corners in certain parts of the film, particularly with the ending.",977443200,2,798,4.15483870967742
1273262,5,B00003CXRO,"It's been a disappointing year so far for Academy Award-caliber movies and performances, but you can always depend on Mr. Reliable--Tom Hanks, who else?--to start whispers of an Oscar just before the close of 2000. I was lucky enough to see an advance screening of ""Cast Away"" and I'm determined to start the positive buzz about this film as quickly as possible.
If you've seen the trailer or watched the commercial, you know the plot: after a terrifying, white-knuckle scene of a plane crash (more harrowing than ""The Perfect Storm""), Federal Express time management expert Chuck Noland gets marooned on a desert island. In less capable hands than this simple plot would have devolved quickly into gung-ho adventure or broad comedy, but Hanks has the subtlety and range to elicit groans of sympathetic horror at his plight as well as laughter over the ridiculous nature of his predicament. The film brilliantly becomes virtually a silent movie for an hour, largely free of spoken dialogue and without music, as Chuck's struggles to survive become exercises in failure, discovery, success, and physical pain. As years slip by and pudgy Chuck turns slim, bronzed, and an expert hunter, he slips into an apparent madness, obsessed with a blood-faced volleyball (named ""Wilson"") that is his only companion on the island. It's Hank's off-handed but sincere talent that makes this concept sympathetic instead of silly, and he has the acting gifts to convince us he's not only not gone crazy, he's remaining desperately sane in the only way he knows how.
It's not a perfect movie: the beginning drags (I found myself thinking, ""Oh, get cast away, already!) and the inevitable bittersweet ending is much less interesting than the two centerpieces of the film, Chuck's first and last months on the island. A plot point involving an unopened FedEx package seemed unbelievable to me but inspires a nice Frank Capra-esque moment at the conclusion. But if only for the scenes on the island, Hanks deserves an Oscar nod for his acting--uncluttered by swelling music and clever dialogue--and for showing us again that he is indeed one of the most versatile and sympathetic character actors of our generation.",976838400,30,2194,5.06353591160221

Wilson was great, he as the movie shows was all he had and when he was gone after the ocean just sucked him in, it took the cast away to his breaking point. He triumphs over his life saving moments and so it has its feel good moments. Great Classic",1521417600,,320,4.015625

It was about discovering (too late) what his priorities should have been (his wife,not his job) ,letting go and in the end searching for.......something , maybe his soul or why he's still alive. He was still on that island and in a sense still a castaway at the end ,driving around Texas with a new soccer ball in the passenger seat.

1273643,5,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks can make any movie great. As a surviving crash member of a Fed Express flight Team he is the sole survivor. He makes it to an island but he has little to live on and he searches for any and all ways to eat, live and survive.

Tom Hanks plays this role to perfection and he literally makes you believe that he is the character in the film. His best friend is a WILSON Sports Volleyball that he becomes so attached to it is a major part of the story.

This is a good film and it is worth owning and watching. The BluRay version of the film is well engineered with good video and audio. I also got a VUDU digital HDX movie that I can stream to my Apple and Android devices and to my TV and to my digital projector onto a 12 foot diagonal screen.

I like this film and I rated it 5 stars.",1516924800,3,794,3.919254658385093

1273725,5,B00003CXRO,"A good film though, of course, a little bit humdrum since we are dealing with a rewriting of the famous Robinson Crusoe story financed by FedEx. Of course, our Robinson Crusoe has to have a Friday, and it is a volleyball with a bloody handprint on it.

It shows how resilient a man can be in any situation, even when he speaks of or caresses the idea of suicide. Life will call him back to resilience please and he will get some satisfaction. Here he twins his fate with his favorite hand-imprinted volleyball named Wilson, its brand name. The relation is close and he speaks to it all the time, to the point we could call it him as if it were a real boy.

He manages to conquer some fire, then to cook some food after breaking many coconuts. He survives like that for four years till the tide brings in some plastic contraption he is going to use as a sail for the raft he decides to build. He will stay lost on the vast Pacific Ocean for days, meet one curious whale and finally be picked by a container monster ship and reinstated in life by FedEx. His girlfriend has married in the meantime. He sure rediscovers her one night but that does not go beyond some preliminaries, at least we think so, though maybe . . .

The good ending will come from one FedEx package he had recuperated on his desert island and brought back with him but the film remains open on the suggestion that there is always a good ending to all stories around the corner if you are receptive to any extra-sensorial messages.

Enjoy the adventure and dream of what you could have done in such a situation.

It took almost 4 hours to watch because it kept shutting off, then I'd resume play, sometimes it would shut off without the resume play button, so I had to fast forward from the beginning. No less than 10 times. I finally gave up and shut it off, never got to see the whole movie. We have fiber connection, fast speed. The problem is definitely NOT on my end and we don't have this problem with Netflix.

It arrived on Wednesday and we watched it (with our kids who had not seen it yet) a couple of times throughout the rest of the week. We thought it was ironic and funny to have this particular movie delivered to us ON AN ISLAND. Lol.",1476144000,2,485,4.21505376344086

Seriously, why are you reading reviews for such a well-known, iconic movie? You don't need to read about Tom Hanks's (Hanks is not a plural noun, so yes, the apostrophe-S is grammatically correct in this case) stunning performance, you just need to pay the few bucks and watch the movie.",1475625600,,420,4.767123287671233

1275347,5,B00003CXRO,I'm a fan of Tom Hanks. For his acting ability and because people say that I look like him. I only wish my bank accounts look like his. It is a good movie and intense. Tom is able to flow into different emotions throughout. It also becomes a love story between Tom and his long lost fiancee Kelly(Helen Hunt). Well worth the cost. Enjoy.,1475193600,,337,4.28125

1275608,3,B00003CXRO,"As a kid, I remember this film being good. People seemed to like it.

Watching it as an adult? It's alright. The best stuff is when Tom Hanks is on the island. But the rest of the movie just fails to do anything for me.

The script is weak. And the dialogue is poor. And the acting OF that dialogue might be worse. Strange lines are delivered with questionable confidence, and if someone told me that every shot was the first take, I'd be inclined to believe them.

I personally hate remakes, but I actually would love a remake of this movie (or at least something like it). The concept is there, and Tom Hanks performs admirably.

Just prepare yourself to be disappointed.",1472083200,,673,4.4471544715447155
1275609,5,B00003CXRO,"Every time I watch this movie, I'm moved. It's one of my all time favorite movies and when I see it on TV, I stop to watch it, commercials and all. I owned a VHS, a DVD and will probably buy the blu-ray version as well. Hanks is a great actor, but it's the screenplay that makes this film work. The long scenes with no dialogue are purposely done to give a feeling of being alone. The bleakness of the island backs this up. Hanks transformation from a typical overweight urban Bluto to a lean, island dwelling fisherman is nothing short of amazing. So many ironies stacked on top of each other. So darn much symbolism packed into one film... it's truly sublime. If you aren't a fan of this movie, then see a doctor because part of you is dead inside.",1471996800,,750,4.288732394366197

It is a great look into the desire to live, the hope you can find in small everyday object and how to cope with absolute loss and not lose your mind (Wilson).  Hanks does a great job...the transformation physically was scary and in the end it seemed like he had been through something...maybe difficult filming locations.  The relationship in the movie (no spoilers here) moved the story along and provided the carrot to a lost man.

1277363,5,B00003CXRO,"I had never seen this film all the way through.  I finally decided that now was the time to watch it.  I have to say that Tom Hanks did a marvelous job as the UPS manager that gets stranded on an island after a plane crash in the ocean.  The special effects of the plane crash were awesome.

With regards to the island that Hanks makes his way to, it seemed as though there was a limited amount of space for the cameras, but Robert Zemeckis as the Director somehow managed to film everything naturally as if no one was there but Hanks.  Of course, a lot of that credit goes to the Director of Photography, who determined where to place the cameras and the type of lighting that would be done for the background.  As I watched the island sequence unfolding, it found it to be utterly believable in what am individual would have to go through in order to survive for as long as he did.  I know after three years I would've hated coconuts and fish.

Helen Hunt as the fiance of Tom Hank's character had rather a short and thankless role.  She was made out as the bad person for finally marrying someone else after being told that Hanks was dead.  I think she handled the role magnificently and helped it to blend into the final sequence perfectly.  All she could do was give him the strength to continue on.

Some might call the ending of the film a little cheesy, but I loved it because after what the main character had gone through, you wanted there to be some hope in his life.  The final scene gives him hope for a better future. I, for one, would like to find out what happened between him and the lady rancher.

There's a lot of extras on the making of the film, which I certainly enjoyed.  More so was the showing of the Charlie Rose interview with Tom Hanks.  Some very poignant questions were asked about the character, the making of the film, Mr. Wilson the volley ball, and also about Saving Private Ryan. It was a very good interview.

So, I would rate this as a pretty good movie that deserved all of its Oscar nominations.  I'm certainly glad I finally got to see the whole thing.  Better late than never.  The two-disc DVD set is definitely worth buying, especially at such a fantastic price.",1449878400,2,2205,4.3447432762836184

1278064,4,B00003CXRO,"I missed out on Cast Away when it came out in 2000, but I always heard people screaming WILSON! on a regular basis. Back then, I wasn't a big fan of Tom Hanks for some reason. In going through a bunch of movies on my queue, Cast Away popped up and I figured I should finally get around to it. I was pleasantly surprised, and its easily one of the best movies Ive seen this year so far.

Chuck Noland is a FedEx executive, who really does love his job. Hes trying to motivate people to work more efficiently in Russia, and to help with his presentation, he ships himself a timer from Memphis, telling them that 87 hours for delivery is big no-no. He heads back home for Christmas, and proposes to his girlfriend Kelly. But Chuck is needed in Malaysia, and has to head out immediately. It isn't long before the flight goes through a severe storm, and all hell breaks loose. The plane is torn apart and crashes, killing everyone except Chuck, who just barely makes it out. He swims and makes it to a small island. Once there, and after trying to settle down from the near-death experience, Chuck collects various FedEx packages that wash ashore. Businessman to the end. The body of one of the pilots washes ashore as well, and Chuck gives him a proper burial. With nearly nothing to work with, he tries to escape in one of the rafts that was on the plane, but is unsuccessful, and heads back. Maybe its time to break the rules and open some of those packages.

Ill admit that I don't know much about survival, and I don't watch a lot of those fake survival shows, but some of the ways Chuck comes up with tools and clothing is pretty neat. Every time hed be stumped on figuring out how to do x or y, Id be sitting there thinking the same thing, putting myself in his situation. Chuck is a very likable character, and you want to see him succeed in surviving and getting off the island, no matter how hopeless it seems. I was also happy to see that Wilson, the much-talked-about volleyball with a face, wasn't a goofy comedic device. I think just about anyone in the same situation would do something similar. Without ever saying a word back to Chuck, Wilson becomes just asm much a character as any of the humans in the movie. Its weird to say and you have to see it to understand better. The movie runs at almost two and a half hours long, but it never dragged on once for me. The beginning, the middle and the great conclusion that got me a little teary eyedeverythings great, and Im already planning on watching some of Tom Hanks other big movies to see what hes capable of.

Honestly, the only thing I didn't like was that they cut from early in Chucks time on the island to much later a bit abruptly. I was hoping to see how he got better at living on the island and how he managed to live on what little food there was. Its not a big complaint, and I didn't want them to spend a long time on seemingly little things, but watching Chuck fail over and over until he succeeds at something a lot of us take for granted like getting fresh water or fire, is always awesome. I think even just two more things like building tools wouldve been great to include. Thats just me though.

Cast Away is definitely a good movie, and Im glad to see that it holds up 15 years later. No poorly done CG, good acting all around, an intense plot, and a kind hero that you can get behind. This is one of those movies I wish I had seen when it first came out now.",1434240000,,3443,4.259938837920489

1278143,5,B00003CXRO,"Academy Award winning Actor - Tom Hanks, is superb in this 2-disc, DVD, deeply moving Special Edition of Director Zemecki's: CAST AWAY. It vividly depicts the stark contrast between the hustle and bustle of a professional on the go, who is very happily engaged to a woman that he adores and who... loves him, and is surrounded by loving relatives, a good home, loyal friends and amicable co-workers. What more could a man want, right? Then suddenly..., by way of a tragic plane malfunction and subsequent accident, is thought to be dead. But is he? No! He survives the horrific ordeal only to be CAST AWAY on an uninhabited island that was without immediate food, shelter and a means to communicate with civilization. It all amounts to a powerful and riveting film that shows a man who had everything to live for, then..., in one catastrophic and unimaginable moment having survived the plummeting of a plane into a body of water, finds himself stranded in the middle of nowhere and after a long search period, was incorrectly presumed dead. Talk about a reversal of fortune in every way, shape and form including, life and death. So, what does he do? How does he go about surviving? How does he go about re-establishing communication to get himself, up and off of that island? What about his immediate needs such as food and shelter? What happened to his beloved fianc&eacute;e? What about his friends and family? What do they do? This extraordinarily powerful and compelling film, graphically depicts that even a ""normal"" human being, who is suddenly... through no fault of their own subjected to inhumane circumstances beyond their control, what they are driven and will resort too, for the sake of food, shelter and some type of companionship. Especially, when faced with the absence of all three. And having tried everything that he could think of to get off of that desolate island, what does he finally try, as a last ditch attempt to get back to the known and civilized world? Does he make it? And who, is his 'new' soul-tie friend? The one, that he cannot bear to be without even while attempting to leave the island and save his own life? Co-dependency to the maximum and dangerous extreme, can be life threatening. An emotionally and psychologically, gripping movie. A story content and outcome that is both mesmerizing and shocking to the point of tears. An excellent motion picture that will cause you to have an emotional response and do some serious thinking, one way or another. Especially if, you're the type to say or know of someone with the mindset, of: ""I'm set for life!"" or ""This will never happen to me!"" ""I'm wealthy and I'll pay and make it go away!"" ""I'm a prosperous businessman (or woman), and I've got sound investments, so I'm secure."" ""I'm so-n-so's... son or daughter, they won't dare mess with me."" ""I've got plenty of money in the bank."" ""I'm as healthy as a horse."" ""I've got a good attorney."" ""The house and car are paid for."" ""I've had this job for 15 years and I'm vested with the company. So, I'm set."" And so forth...!! Death, calamity of any kind, accidents (auto or otherwise), unforeseen hardship and sudden health issues - strike an individual or friends, family and loved ones, often without warning. This is a 'must see' movie that will leave you thinking and perhaps, adjusting your level of gratitude for the things that you do have, for the time that you have them. An entertaining, yet subtle and very powerful drama that's a definite keeper for your home DVD collection. Nina Kish",1432684800,,3532,4.763458401305057

1278708,4,B00003CXRO,This is an excellent movie. It is suspenseful and shows the resiliency of one man who survives a plane crash and being stranded on a small Pacific island.  Tom Hanks is excellent as a driven FEDEX manager who must survive under brutal conditions such as lack of food and water.  The film makes it clear just how difficult it is for Hanks to find or produce fresh water to meet his basic needs to survive. Hanks has an extremely expressive face which certainly helps in a film like this where the lead character must go through so many emotional experiences. I found the film to be highly entertaining and enjoyable.,1420675200,,615,4.581818181818182

1278781,5,B00003CXRO,One of the best movies about hope every written. I had heard this wasn't a big blockbuster because it took so long to tell the story on the big screen. But some people are missing the point. This wasn't a brain-candy type movie that moves quickly with guns and car chases. This was an interesting movie that did a fantastic job of telling a great story about what would really happen if you were on an abandoned island for a few years. Have patience and look closely at the details my fellow movie renters.,1420416000,3,506,4.3936170212765955

1278785,5,B00003CXRO,"I am a huge Tom Hanks fan so this is just one more to my list of his movies that I absolutely love!  I think it is very well made in the aspect that even though a good part of the movie only contains one character, Tom Hanks, you are never bored watching or or feel there is a loss of content.  This movie does a good job of exploring the need we have for interaction with others and how when alone for an extended time we strive to find ways to create the closest thing we can to a relationship to have something to help identify with and share  the triumphs and struggles of living.",1420156800,,584,4.017241379310345

1279399,3,B00003CXRO,This movie has become a classic in my household and in many others as well. One of Tom Hanks best performances.

1279405,5,B00003CXRO,"There's really a whole lot more to this than just Tom Hanks alone on an island. It works on a visceral level as a straightforward tale of survival amidst the harshest conditions imaginable, but underneath the surface there's all manner of allegorical goodness also at play. It's intense and powerful no matter how you choose to take it, though, and that's the sign of a real masterwork. That whole stack of cards teeters on Hanks's work in the central role, of course, and he flat-out crushes it. In a way, his whole career up to this point has been preparing him for this kind of an effort; I can see shreds of many of his earlier roles, alive in his gamut of expressions, as he slowly, grimly comes to terms with the fact that there's no form of rescue on the horizon. He's familiar but lost, a modern-day everyman denied his tool belt, stripped bare to the very core of his being. It's an all-world performance, easily among the best of his career, though it didn't quite draw the accolades that his turns in Philadelphia or Forrest Gump enjoyed. Behind the lens, Robert Zemeckis also hands in some of his best work. Experimenting with before-their-time camera angles and quick, effective snapshots of daily life on the island, he's able to evolve his craft without losing touch with his typically warm, lush brand of storytelling. And, needless to say, Cast Away's famous crash scene remains one of film's most historically intense, white-knuckle rides. I didn't realize I'd been holding my breath until it was all over. A fantastic picture that only stumbles in the payoff, lingering in the moment for longer than it really should, then momentarily giving in to its indulgent, romantic side.",1411948800,,1696,4.791808873720137

1279655,5,B00003CXRO,Tom Hanks took a subject most people draw cartoons for and made a believable movie about being shipwrecked on an island for years. It covers every ugly and beautiful experience.  I felt the horror of having to bust out a rotten tooth!  It has humor at times.  I think this movie appealed to me because of solitude and the effort to stay sane through such an ordeal!

1279987,5,B00003CXRO,"A man stranded alone on a deserted island.  If anyone can make that work on the big screen, it's Tom Hanks.  And, predictably, he succeeds.  Hanks plays time-obsessed FedEx executive Chuck Noland who is involved in one of the company's plane crashes and becomes the sole survivor when he makes it to a small deserted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.  Again, this is a difficult role for anyone to pull off, but Tom Hanks managed the task, even if it wasn't easy for him.  With just him and a volleyball on the screen for most of the time, there was still a sense of wonder, suspense, and involvement for the audience.  Of course, companies like FedEx and Wilson Sporting Goods surely benefited greatly.  This was a great movie and, even though I'm blind, I have no complaints.  Go out and get it for yourselves!

I don't like how it ended.  I feel like it just does not fit the movie.  The ending is very out of place, like the director just didn't know how to end the movie.  Weird.

In researching this, the writer actually went on a survival training course with three experts in stone-age technology.

1280242,5,B00003CXRO,"There are already a great many reviews here providing a summary of the plot, opinions on historical accuracy and acting. Therefore, this review will only focus upon the actual quality of the transfer of 'Cast Away' to Blue Ray. Keep in mind that the quality of what you see and hear also depends upon the quality of TV monitor you are using and its accompanying home theater processor and speakers. I have a pretty high end, esoteric system and am judging the Blu Ray off of that.

VIDEO QUALITY....
  Shot on film, Cast Away presents a very nice appearance on Blu Ray and, compared to my Standard Definition copy, an overall improvement.  However, this improvement is not night and day.  Color resolution is fairly realistic and skin tones are accurate and not overly saturated.  Focus can be soft in some place but contrast is quite good.  The soft focus can be seen early in the film when there is a aerial pan of the fields...here the grass and plains are justly green but without much detail to the blades, it appears to be a green blur.  However, I am nitpicking on this as the whole of the movie on Blu Ray is quite nice.  At no point did I see any artifacting or other video issues.  The Mbps appeared to average nicely in the high 30's and low 40's.  Four stars for the video.

AUDIO QUALITY....
  The DTS HD MA 5.1 lossless audio is the real star of the Blu Ray's quality.  The entire first 30 minutes of film's audio is definitely demo worthy.  It is full of pans across the front and rear channels and many appropriately placed discreet foley fx steered to the individual surrounds.  The music score immerses you as it is steered throughout the entire home theater's audio system. The rest of the film, starting with Tom Hank's character on the island, also has plenty of discreet channeling to the surrounds.  They are just not quite as congested as the first half hour called for.  Still, rain fall and storms throughout the film, as well as ocean waves, whale calls and more make great use of all your surround speakers and LFE sub channel.  I must admit that I was surprised by the outstanding audio editing and sound reproduction.  5  stars easily on the audio.

EXTRAS.....
  Other than the director's commentary, there are no extras.  What the menu calls 'search content' is just another form of scene selection.  There is a trivia track that, if selected, pops up various tidbits during the course of the film but I did not utilize it.  The theatrical trailer is also included.  There are no deleted or alternate scenes but, thankfully, there are also no previews of other films which just take up disc space and call for more compression to the film. I never liked paying for advertising on Blu Rays and, here, I don't.

This film was certainly a major hit when it was released and it still retains its movie legs.
I do hope that this review has been of some HELP to you in deciding your purchase. All my reviews focus solely upon the quality of the actual disc and not redundant summaries and acting opinions.

1280277,5,B00003CXRO,"Who the heck gives this movie one star?!  I can see 4 stars, or even maybe, 3 stars.  But one?!

They should make a TV show about a whole group of people who have a plane crash on a mysterious island!  Oh wait, they did that already -- it's called Lost.  :-)

Seriously, though -- what an amazing performance by Tom Hanks.  Definitely shows his chops as an actor.  Acting with no one else in the scene has got to be one of the hardest things to do as an actor, and he does it brilliantly.

I saw this movie when it came out in theaters back in 2000, and I loved it then.  If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to rent it.  $2.99 to rent it?  It's worth every penny!  Especially if you haven't seen it in awhile...  What an amazing movie!

What would YOU do if you were stuck on an island in the south-pacific all alone?  This movie really makes you wonder.

And the title is perfect -- ""Cast Away.'  Is he a castaway, or was his life cast away by the people who knew him when they thought he was dead? That's the question that this movie forces you to ask yourself.  Really makes you think about what's important in your life, and what truly isn't.  I don't really have the words to express how this movie makes me feel -- you just have to watch it and find out for yourself.  The $2.99 you'll spend to rent it on Amazon Instant video is well worth the money.",1396310400,3,1372,4.063670411985019

A man who said less than a dozen words in the movie.  A movie goer suggested I watch Cast Away for a better survival movie. Cast Away puts you in the skin of a decent man who is trying to stay alive.  He even talks to a volley ball.  It is difficult for the viewer not to admire his survival skills and his transformation.

Tom Hanks is a great actor, and proves it yet again with his outstanding performance in Cast Away.  In fact, all of the acting is solid and convincing, helping to flesh out characters I actually cared about.

I really enjoy movies with a survival theme where I can place myself into the shoes of the protagonist, imagining what he or she feels and is thinking.  I love being taken along on the ride as the unexpected pops up, wondering how well I would deal with the challenges.  Hanks does an outstanding job of drawing in the viewer into just this type of experience.  And of course, there's the very human an emotional side of things, from the surprisingly heart wrenching relationship with ""Wilson"" and the tragic loss of his companionship, to the homecoming where Hanks tries to sift through the life and love he left behind.

1280946,3,B00003CXRO,"I went to see ""Cast Away"" in the theater during Christmas 2000 because I have a taste for stranded-on-deserted-island movies like ""Mysterious Island"" (1961), but was somewhat disappointed. Why? Possibly because of the fact that Tom Hanks' character in the film, Chuck Noland, is stuck on an island all by his lonesome and the island is very small. As such, there's zero social interaction, except with a soccer ball that chuck names Wilson, and there's very little exploration of the island because it's so small. On top of this, the ending is odd and somewhat ambiguous. Despite this, ""Cast Away"" was a surprise hit at the box office.

Viewing it a second time, I was braced for its uniqueness and got more out of it, but there's still a lot of downtime or empty stretches as Chuck tries to survive for over four years on the island and then faces a completely new life and perspective in the closing act. So don't expect a lot of action or high adventure; this is a drama about the mundaneness of being stuck on a deserted island and how it positively or negatively affects you. There are only a couple of thrilling scenes, like the excellent plane crash.

As noted above, the film respects the intelligence of the viewer by not spelling everything out, but the answers are there for anyone who takes the time to reflect on the events and clues. Some questions the film might provoke: How exactly does a certain Fed-Ex package save Chuck's life? Where's God in all of this? The Texas ranch at the beginning belongs to ""Dick and Bettina"", but at the end to just Bettina, what does this mean? Why the angel symbol of all things? Where does Chuck decide to go at the end?

Like I said, ""Cast Away"" is a one-of-a-kind film and so you have to be in the right mode for it. But, when you are, it's very satisfying and even... enlightening.

The film runs 143 minutes.

1280950,5,B00003CXRO,"I just can't resist a good survivor movie and this is certainly one of the best.  Tom Hanks is brilliant in his role as Chuck Noland, a FedEx executive who is the sole survivor of a cargo plane crash near a remote island in the middle of the ocean way off course, and consequently not in the path of where they would be searching.  His will to survive is strengthened by his love for Kelly Frears, played by Helen Hunt, whom he was planning to marry when the plane went down.  One of the reasons the film works so well is that Hanks actually lost 50 or 60 lbs during the filming. They literally halted the production for a year or so, giving him that amount of time to lose the weight, so scenes of him on the beach with his shirt off at the beginning of the movie, and then later when he's looking like he truly hasn't eaten anything other than fish for 4 years lends an air of authenticity to the film that could never occur had he merely worn a ""fat"" suit to begin with, etc.  But it's his portrayal of a man whose spirit than will not give up that gives this movie its soul and in the end.. even though it doesn't have a fairy tale ending.. it definitely satisfies the viewer to the point where you almost don't want it to end.",1380758400,6,1231,4.138075313807532

1281147,5,B00003CXRO,"To my surprise, I liked this film much more than I expected and towards the end I was rather impressed. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

As probably everybody knows, this is the story of a guy who finds himself stranded on a small, uninhabited island, far from everything - and who has to somehow survive, pending the arrival of possible rescue. The guy's name is Chuck (Tom Hanks) and at the beginning of the film he is a kind of annoying although mostly harmless jerk. I will say no more about the plot here.

This is a long (143mn) and rather slow film but, surprise surprise - I didn't really feel all that time passing. And I felt that I had mostly good time when watching it. The story is rather believable, the ordeal lived by the hero has a kind of realistic touch in it and with time I started to care about Chuck - and even more surprisingly, about Wilson... No, I am not saying here who is Wilson - if you don't know it yet, don't look it up on the web, watch the film and find out by yourself.

The last 20 minutes are particularly strong and, well, yes - beautiful even, to a certain extent in a ""Forrest Gump""-like bittersweet way. There is some humour, but not TOO much - on another hand there is emotion, by moments even a lot of it...

Some lessons in survival can be learned from ""Cast Away"", including that you do not really need to have balls to survive for years on a desert island - but it helps to have at least one...))) Also, it is quite logical that the way out of a tight spot goes through an outhouse...))) Finally, a precious warning - even if you are oficially dead, never trust your dentist...)))

This is essentially a ""one man show"" and Tom Hanks is excellent in this film, which seems like his swan song, because to my considerable regret I do not think I liked him in ANYTHING else since 2000 - and I especially hated such his films like ""Terminal"" and ""Ladykillers"" (I didn't see ""Da Vinci code"" and I do not intend to...)

So bottom line, I found this film surprisingly good, I had good time watching it and I sincerely recommend to see it. Enjoy!",1376438400,,2103,4.311392405063291
1281148,5,B00003CXRO,"I find it hard to believe that there is somebody out there that hasn't seen Castaway. Except for the sappy love story line this is a gritty movie about survival.

1281314,5,B00003CXRO,"In 2000 I saw the movie like almost everyone else and was surprised to sit through more than two hours of it, despite warnings that it was going to be a very slow movie.  I was writing my doctoral thesis and felt for Helen Hunt's character Kelly who was in the process of finishing her Ph. D. studies.  So the ending broke my heart to know that she had pretty much ditched her academic plans down through the tragedy and confusion of it all (I got my degree, fortunately).  Years later, scenes of Tom Hank's character Chuck's frenetic career, the plane crash, and the 4-year existence as an isolated man who could speak to no one but himself, his fiance in his imagination, and his friend Wilson stuck with me.  But nothing like the heart-rending last part of the movie that was anticlimactic at best, especially when Kelly chases after Chuck outside the driveway in the rain.  Thirteen years later, I buy a secondhand DVD, and I am amazed how powerful those scenes are: the near-reunion at the FedEx terminal, the reunion of mixed and conflicting emotions at Kelly's house, now also inhabited by her new husband and young daughter, and Chuck's emotional conversation with his work colleague and friend.  These scenes are powerful evocations of the complexity of human thought and emotion: dealing with a reunion that is awkward, confusing, and undefinable.  The director and the actors Hanks and Hunt were brilliant in putting it together.  I have seen the last series of scenes about four times since I got the DVD yesterday, and man, they speak for the entire movie!  Tom Hanks might have had too high of a profile in the 80s to 2000s, but especially in the 90s, but he is such a very good actor.  So is Helen Hunt, as proven in her latest movie ""The Sessions"".  Overall, ""Cast Away"" is a keeper!",1373587200,,1799,4.6257861635220126

1281711,5,B00003CXRO,"I had to write my own, brief review of this film after seeing so many ridiculously negative ones.  This movie succeeds in every way.  Too many movies anymore are big budgets and not much else.  We have such short attention spans that unless there is a friggin' explosion every 10 minutes we can't sit through it.  This movie is for people that love good stories, that can sit through a slow-moving, methodical movie.  Do NOT rent/buy this if  you want some action-packed edge of your seat thriller.  It's not that kind of movie.  The thought of being stranded like Tom is so overwhelmingly depressing, yet there are moments where I couldn't stop laughing.  It's an emotional journey from start to finish.  The ending rips my heart out every time I see it.  To think he survived from the inspiration of his girlfriend only to get back home to find that she has moved on is so sad it brings me to tears every time.  A great movie and one that I always watch at least some of when I see it on TV.  And for those of you who don't ""get"" the ending.  His life was all about structure and schedules before he was stranded.  After he gets back and finds that the one thing he lived for is gone, he has to find a new direction-hence the standing at a crossroads at the end thinking about where to go next.  His life is now wide open with any number of choices and ways to go.",1364601600,3,1366,4.27734375

All of those are useless unless the right mentalities are present.  In Cast Away this is ever so present and brings you the non-stop emotion-driven actions taken by Tom Hanks character in order to survive and deal with loss, isolation, frustration and depression, not to mention the physical stresses and injuries which are inflicted throughout the ordeal.

From a survival point of view this movie is awesome!  Showing the importance of never giving up, having tenacity, audacity and clinging on to life values which drive us to keep going.  A difficult situation represented well, having me deep in thought about how to survive the situation presented.  A great survival movie!",1361836800,,815,5.090225563909774

1281926,4,B00003CXRO,"There's a great movie in Cast Away. The time in which a Fed Ex worker named Chuck Noland is stranded on an island, most of the movie, is a triumph in movie-making. It puts a single actor on what appears to be a single set for a long time with no real dialogue, other characters to interact with or cuts back to the normal world, and manages to stay both captivating and believable the whole time.

Okay, there's one thing that isn't very believable. That has to do with a particular Fed Ex package, one of the few man-made items Chuck has at his disposal. There's also a volleyball, ice skates and not much else. This is a tale of survival in the truest sense. What almost ruins the experience is the epilogue, which lasts for too long and seems irrelevant in comparison to everything that came before it.

1282104,5,B00003CXRO,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Cast Away"" and starred Tom Hanks. I found it on the five dollar rack at Wal-Mart and it was one of the best movies I've seen in at least the last decade. I've always liked camping. I guess it's just a little adventure in  that you're out in the open and don't really know what's going to happen. Plus, it's coping with natural conditions. Well, that's just a micro-adventure, of course. If you want to view a really stupendous adventure, give ""Cast Away"" a viewing.

Tom Hanks played a globe-trotting, overly busy FedEx employee. He joined his fiance in Memphis at Christmas and promised to be back on New Year's Eve, after a quick trip to the Far East. Well, the FedEx plane went down somewhere in the Western Pacific. Hanks managed to escape and with a small inflatable raft made it to an unknown, apparently uninhabited island. His only possessions were that which he had on him and about a half-dozen FedEx packages which beached along with him plus a dead FedEx employee who was killed in the plane wreck and floated ashore. Well, it was immediately back to The Stone Age for Hanks with no food, no tools no shelter and few clothes. Of course, there were the FedEx packages, which had such useful items as a pair of figure skates, a volleyball and a big collection of VHS tapes. The skates became his only tool and the volleyball, with a face fashioned out of a blood smear, became his only companion He called the ball Wilson, after the brand name.

The movie depicted Hanks' struggle to cope with his environment and find enough foodstuffs to survive. He ended up living on coconuts, small crustaceans and the few fish he could catch. Ultimately, he got a fire started, Boy Scout Style. This type of struggle went on for over four years and was just exceptionally well depicted. Ultimately, he built a raft out of wood scraps tied together mostly by vines and the VHS tapes. He managed to get it out beyond the surf zone with him then floating out in the open ocean where he was discovered, near death, by a freight liner almost 500 miles from his island origin, Then it was back to civilization. Everyone had given up on his survival. He had been given a funeral. They even buried a casket containing some of his belongings. His fiance was married and had about a three-year-old daughter.

This was just a stunningly good movie. Essentially, it's a one-man show with just a bit of minor support at the beginning and end. There is no question in my mind that Hanks should have had the Best Actor Academy Award no matter what the competition was, His performance was just stunning. The direction and photography and everything about this film a\was just about perfect. Essentially, there was almost no action. It was just a one-man struggle against nature. There were no wild animals, not even birds. No disasters, other than the plane crash. No musical score to accompany the movie. None of the essentials, yet it was a stunningly good movie.

1282205,5,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away (2000)
Drama, 143 minutes
Directed by Robert Zemeckis
Starring Tom Hanks

Tom Hanks was probably the biggest box office draw for around 10 years, starting with Philadelphia in 1993. Like Meryl Streep, his performances haven't always won the awards they deserved. We expect excellence from Hanks and Streep, and it's never easy to add an Oscar after you have already won twice. Cast Away sees Hanks give one of his best performances, and that's saying a lot.

The opening part of the film introduces us to the life of Chuck Noland (Hanks). He works for FedEx and is obsessed with time. Everything has to happen according to schedule or he considers himself a failure. Noland is in love with Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), but his life is too busy for him to make her his main priority. They have to exchange Christmas gifts in the car on their way to the airport because he doesn't make time for anything more significant. This is a common theme in the lives of too many people. We rush around, earning as much money as we can, barely slowing down long enough to spend time with the people we love. You don't miss it until it's gone.

Noland's plane crashes and he's the sole survivor. He manages to swim ashore and finds himself alone on an island. This isn't a new idea, but the execution is excellent. Noland is used to a comfortable life and has to learn how to survive in his new surroundings. Where will he live? What will he eat? Will he need to protect himself? What if he's ill or in pain? How will he remain sane? How will he escape and make his way back to civilization?

I enjoy Cast Away because it's such a peaceful movie. All we hear are natural sounds while Noland is trapped on the island. There isn't even any musical score during this extended sequence. It helps us realize what it is like to be completely alone. How would we adapt and survive? Would we have the mental strength to seek escape? It's an examination of how human beings think, and that always appeals to me.",1330473600,,1997,4.478021978021978

1282284,1,B00003CXRO,"Too many improbable situations:
1) I could see someone surviving a smaller plane or corporate-type jet crash but not one with a large jet like that. First, the loss of cabin pressure would most likely have asphyxiated the people inside not to mention the final impact would have been too great for there to be any survivors. The forces alone would have made it impossible for him to hang on as he did in several of those scenes.
2) To say they searched for him for weeks. (See above.)
3) To think they could have located the island after he was rescued when there are so many hundreds of minute islands dotting the oceans.
4) When he arrived at the island there were no birds or animals anywhere and then as the movie progresses he finds only fish and crab?? Is that possible or probable? I don't know.
5) To have a little girl that age, his girlfriend would have had to marry almost right away. Those pictures made her look 3 or 4 years old.
6) No one was thronging him; no reporters following him immediately after he gets back. No way! Good Morning America would have wanted him on the show the very next day.",1326153600,2,1112,4.3768115942028984

When I first saw it I could not remember the last time a movie had me glued to the tv so strong that I could not wait to see what was going to happen next.  It does remind me a little of ""The Edge"", with anthony hopkins but more interesting.  A film that should keep your attention well from the start to end and then some.  It's not a sci-fiction, war or animated type picture but a tense drama that keeps you in suspense.  For sure a Tom Hanks classic.

1282287,5,B00003CXRO,Thank you for offerring this movie at such a great price. It arrived even earlier than you had told me to expect.,1320710400,,113,4.181818181818182
1282288,3,B00003CXRO,"What I liked most is that as if the story is a replay of man's days during the dawn of civilization.
Hanks makes fire, grabs fruits, brings out coconut water, builds a shelter, makes bare minimum dress, prepares improvised tool for fishing and builds the boat  - everything that man had to do in prehistoric time without help of any modern tool or technology. All he had on his side was to strong will to overcome all problems in hand with undying spirit.

No woman is there in this action replay of human history, but it emphasizes enough on importance of a partner in human life through 'Wilson' - the soccer ball. This idea of the ball as companion to talk was innovative and effective one as there was no other person on the island.

The entire episode on the island is very fresh, rare and exciting. Usage of dialogue is very economical but thanks to Hanks, its always lively. We can feel that this is no vacation, but sort of an exile at a remote place and the resulting loneliness.

But the end is rather clumsy as the beginning is more lengthy than necessary. Fred Smith's (FedEx's real life CEO even today) inclusion adds surprise and genuineness but the story could have well ended there. It tried to deal with another matter which demands a full scale film for itself.",1317945600,2,1279,4.523809523809524

1282387,4,B00003CXRO,"It's surprising just how good `Cast Away' is. I mean, who would've thought a film about a man alone on a desert island would be so riveting? Maybe that is testament to Tom Hanks who turns out a star performance here. The location and scenery are also amazing and the direction shows it off to excellent effect. This film follows Chuck Noland (Hanks) as he survives a plane crash and has to live on a deserted island in the middle of the pacific ocean for four years. You live his loneliness and trials as he struggles to survive and learn the skill necessary to get by. In fact the scene when he finally learns to make fire, and his reaction to it, never fails to raise a smile and you truly feel his jubilation. The middle section of the film on the island is very quiet, as previously noted in other reviews, but it doesn't drag and only heightens the isolation Noland must feel. Hanks keeps you engrossed by his every nuance and movement he makes. It's only when Noland begins to unwrap FedEx parcels (from the plane crash) and finds a Wilson Volley ball, that he paints a face onto, does he start talking again. It actually become quite touching to see him interact with an inanimate object and must be one of the most unique on-screen relationships ever! The ending is a little `Hollywood' and cheesy, but not excessively so and I'll admit to a lump in my throat briefly towards the end. This is a simple premise, excellently executed and although I've seen this film many times it never gets boring or any less gripping. Well worth a watch.

1282391,5,B00003CXRO,"OK, while going to the dentist is probably not on most people's top-10 list of things to do, whenever I have a trip to the dentist on the calendar, I like to watch ""Cast Away"" the night before.  I am especially likely to do that if I have a major dental event the next day...you know, like a root canal, getting a crown, or even cavities that need to be filled.

This film is almost entirely a solo effort by Tom Hanks, and he does a fantastic job of being a time-obsessed FedEx exec who spends his time flying around the world trouble-shooting and instructing FedEx centers about how to be more efficient and time-conscious, until tragedy strikes.  The time flies by for me each time I watch this film as Hanks works to find ways to survive alone on a small south Pacific island where he washes ashore.

The acting is absolutely top-notch.  The storyline is great, and the combination of acting, story, and music rates a solid 5 stars.

1282525,5,B00003CXRO,"I started watching this movie during dinner, a time when I usually don't watch the ending of many movies. I generally turn off the TV and dash back to my beloved computer. BUT Hanks grabbed me from the first scene of this powerful movie, holding me captive until the bittersweet ending. He's a fine actor and was superb in this role.

Hanks plays the part of Chuck Noland, a FedEx systems engineer on company business when the plane crashes and he ends up alone on a deserted island. The photography and visuals are excellent when they follow Chuck's progress as he does everything humanly possible in order to survive. His physical and mental regression are heart-breaking to see, yet the film has its uplifting moments when he makes ""friends"" with a Wilson volleyball, using it as a ""human"" sounding board to keep his sanity. He names the ball ""Wilson,"" of course. The scenes when he talks to the volleyball look rather ""insane,"" but are the few touches of humor in the film.

The scene where Chuck ""loses"" Wilson touched my heart; a very moving moment. By that time in the movie, Director Robert Zemeckis's wisdom in choosing stark island scenes to emphasize Chuck's solitude were remarkably evident.

Just how does Chuck lose Wilson? How does he react? How is he finally rescued? How has his life changed when he gets back to the real world? How?...How?...How? And Is his girlfriend--played brilliantly by the fine actress Helen Hunt--still waiting for him after four years when everyone thought he was dead?

You will learn the answers to those questions as you view this film that is brought vividly to life through Hank's realistic portrayal and the director's keen insight into this character. The sound effects and rhythmic camera moves capture Chuck's emerging survival skills to perfection.

""Hope springs eternal in the human breast,"" and after one episode when Chuck almost gives up, he never loses hope again, clinging to it despite the odds he's facing. His hope never seems to fail him until he returns home and faces his new reality in a very moving confrontation with the sweetheart he left behind. (Being a hopeless romantic, at that moment in the movie, I wanted this film to end the way I wanted it to...but that wasn't meant to be...)

However, the film had a hopeful ending, one that left it up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions. I know what ending I chose, so I was not left with a feeling of wonderment, but with a strong feeling of hope and a fresh start for Chuck. Why not see this film and choose your own ending?

Even though it was rather odd for one man to carry an entire movie, that's what happened in this one--and Hanks was up to the job! I agree with the New York Post review: Tom Hanks ""...gives one of the towering screen performances of all time."" Five stars all the way to the bank...

1282527,5,B00003CXRO,"'Cast Away' first hit standard DVD back in 2001, and at the time was widely considered to be one of the best transfers around. I gave that disc a quick spin before watching this new Blu-ray, and was surprised by how well it has held up. That gave this new 1080p/AVC MPEG-4 encode a great deal to live up to, but I'm happy to report that it's more than up to the challenge. (Note that the back of the Blu-ray box incorrectly lists the film's aspect ratio as 2.35:1; it is in fact 1.85:1.)

Robert Zemeckis brings all of his considerable visual talents to 'Cast Away,' as well as the latest in CGI technology (at least circa 2000). As such, the film is visually sumptuous all the way through -- particularly the second act on the island. The level of depth and detail reaches fantastic, and the color saturation is exquisite. The shimmering waters are a gorgeous, crystal clear blue, and the expansive vistas are flush with deep jungle greens. Just as impressive are darker scenes, with shadow delineation holding up wonderfully even in scenes with minimal light sources (such as moonlight or a bonfire). Yes, there is grain in the picture, but all of the positive elements can elevate 'Cast Away' to the level of demo material.

It's not really a complaint, but the opening and closing acts of ""Cast Away' a bit more plain, at least in terms of bright colors and picturesque visuals. However, this is obviously intentional, and even here the transfer doesn't falter. The visual palette is muted but fleshtones hold firm, and there is still a great deal of depth and dimensionality throughout. The presentation is also nice and sharp, with no irritating edge enhancement or other compression issues. Now seven years old, 'Cast Away' fully qualifies as a Blu-ray catalog title, but it's one of the best I've seen yet from Fox.",1273190400,3,1823,4.7115987460815045

Sometimes you have to give credit where its due. The diversity of emotions felt during the viewing was amazing. It's an old movie, most people have probably seen this but it's still so good and honest. These types of movies are what Hollywood should be producing.",1271462400,,396,4.513888888888889
1282617,3,B00003CXRO,"In this movie, Tom Hanks plays a corrupt FedEx worker who gets his comeuppance after he opens several FedEx packages that do not belong to him while en route to an overseas FedEx delivery. He opens packages and steals the following items from trusting FedEx customers: A pair of ladies figure skates, a volleyball, a dress, and a bunch of video tapes.
He ends up delivering only one of the packages that he was supposed to deliver, and it takes more than four years to make the delivery.

I don't want to spoil the ending, so I'll let you find out for yourself how he gets his comeuppance.",1269820800,5,589,4.453703703703703
1282618,4,B00003CXRO,"When I popped this Blu-Ray Disc in to watch, I find that it's high definition remastering is really no better than my DVD version.

This is a movie that I have on DVD that I thought would probably look better on Blu-ray Hi-Definition, but it is certainly not one of the first Blu-Ray discs that I ran out to buy.  I made an expense vow that I plan to stick to.  I will only replace my absolute favorite movies (which are about 60 of my 500+ movies) at any price under $30.  But, anything else that I already have on DVD that's not incredibly fantastic, I will only buy the new Blu-ray version if it's $9.99 or less.  I have to initiate a discipline for myself so I don't go wasting my money on replacing movies that I'll just watch again, once more maybe, and then have it just sit on my DVD shelf as a part of a proud collection that may never be watched again anytime soon.

I'm definitely going to be very selective of how I buy Blu-Ray discs.  I've bought just 24 in the past year and I just bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  I just wasn't that anxious to buy a Blu-ray disc player although I know I've bought some Blu-Ray discs where I'd like to someday see a better quality picture of a film that I truly enjoy..  When I eventually bought about 24 Blu-Ray discs, I bought my first Blu-Ray disc player.  But, I must maintain spending discipline on my Blu-Ray disc expenses!  It's very important that I live this way for my movie library.  Because, before you know it, they will eventually come out with something better than Blu-ray, like 1500p resolution.  You know, that's not too far-fetched to imagine.  Blu-Ray is simply not the end to improved video quality.  I hope you all know that.

UPDATE: I've just recently bought a new 47"" LCD TV.  Maybe this was a mistake because it is NOW that I see a great improvement of my Blu-Ray DVD's over my regular DVD's.  So, I guess the only way that I can continue enjoying my regular DVD's is to keep watching my DVD's only on my 32"" LCD TV with the HDMI hook-up because at 32 inches, DVD's look very much like High Definition.  On the 47"" TV, regular DVD's just don't look that good.",1269648000,,2138,4.3
1282619,4,B00003CXRO,"This is one I was goaded into seeing by someone shortly after it was released on DVD and I watched strictly for humoring them. I was pleasantly surprised and occasionally get the urge to watch it again about once a year or so. I make no comments whatsoever on which release is what or HD, different versions and tech specs. I speak strictly of the movie itself.

It was well done and very haunting with the psychology of loneliness and isolation. The silence and lack of soundtrack through most of the movie drives it home, though when you watch it for the first time, you usually can't put your finger on it. We're so trained to hear music scores and laugh tracks and they are effecting the feel of the story without us ever knowing it. Its almost subliminal. When you remove it, you can't help but know something is off and have a guttural reaction to the intense silence - something most of us rarely hear these days.

Considering how many times this movie has been spoofed with the line ""Wilson!"" You almost have to watch just for popularity purposes, but the reason it's popular is its so damn good. Hanks' character is so palpable and real, you feel his frustration, fear and sadness. To imagine being so close, yet so far and knowing for so long that everyone you ever loved is moving on without you. And how such a intelligent, grounded person is driven to making an imaginary friend out of a volleyball to keep his sanity.

Bottom line, its well done, well acted and a great story about resilience and loneliness and moving on. Definite must see, even if you only watch it once.",1268956800,2,1587,4.503472222222222
1282620,5,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks is brilliant in this movie about him who works for FedEx and while he is flying on a FedEx plane the plane has problem with its cargo and the plane crashes into the Pacific. Hanks lives and survives for four years on a island and after the four years makes his escape with Wilson who is a volleyball that he talks to. I remember seeing this in the theater and when he finally makes fire the audience clapped for him.  You will actually cheer for him while he learns to survive on some remote island in the Pacific, I believe it was.  The ending will have wondering which way he turns either North, South, East, or West, I believe that is how life is.  This movie is a must see.",1268179200,2,687,4.1893939393939394

Why the manufacturers/studio chose to cheat the public with a blu-ray movie price is senseless. Great movie but a terrible product.",1268006400,11,240,4.355555555555555
1282622,5,B00003CXRO,"Castaway presents an interesting series of premises. The first, and most obvious, is a survival story: Chuck Noland is the sole survivor of the crash of a cargo plane, and finds himself stranded on a very small island in the South Pacific. He must learn to survive there, and we are treated a a painful series of scenes as he does so, salvaging what he can from the wreckage and from the body of a comrade. Tom Hanks does a fine job with the role, and despite the beauty of the island, it never is allowed to feel welcoming to us.

But what makes Castaway a step above is that is isn't about the island, or about Noland's survival. Rather, it is about what the experience does to him, how he deals with the loss of pretty much everything in his life. For his is a sort of death, a sort of purgatory, a liminal state. And then we see him leave his island and achieve rescue.

Here the movie could have ended, and many stories would have, giving in to the all too common desire to have a happy ending (see films like either version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Flight-of-the-Phoenix/dp/B00008MTVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Flight of the Phoenix</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flight-of-the-Phoenix/dp/B0007KIFI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flight of the Phoenix</a>). But what pushes Castaway into a class of its own is that we get to witness Noland's rebirth, his resurrection of sorts. Helen Hunt does a nice job as his old girlfriend, who was forced to grieve for him and move on, and Nick Searcy is excellent as his friend and colleague. And so the film poses the question of identity in the end: who are we, and how much of who we are depends on those around us? Castaway brings us closer to an answer without preaching by first stripping so much away from Noland, and then giving it back.",1267747200,,1892,5.080385852090032
1282623,4,B00003CXRO,"Everyone that I know either loves this movie or hates it.  They either find it completely engrossing or mind-numbingly boring.  I'm kind of in the middle.  I find it a tad long, but I find Hanks to be surprisingly riveting (I'm not always sold on his talent) and his strong performance carries the film for me.  It has to, since he is the only person on screen for nearly the entire running length.

The film tells the story of Chuck Noland, a FED-EX systems engineer who finds himself stranded on an island for four years after the plain he is on crashes into the ocean during a terrible storm.  He survives, obviously, but the experience has a lasting effect on Chuck.

For me, it is hard to really build a film based solely on a man's solitary survival.  There is not a whole lot you can do, and while the film's execution of Chuck's adventures are startlingly engaging, when the film ended I felt as if it was just beginning.  For me, the most intriguing aspect of this story is how Chuck survives AFTER he comes home to find the life he left behind a mere memory.  Yes, his escapades on the island are necessary to establish growth and that survival instinct (and the way that Zemeckis films the island itself perfectly establishes to `gravity' of the whole experience) but when all is said and done, this is about how this experience CHANGES a person, and I feel like we only witnessed to very beginning of that change.

Alas, I still really like this movie.

Like I mentioned, Tom Hanks is not an actor I am usually drawn to.  I find a lot of his work highly overrated and even gimmicky and amateurish (his two Oscar wins themselves are disgusting) but here he transcends gimmick (I mean, this is a gimmicky character) and develops a REAL man.  He commands the screen 100% of the time, and never resorts to taking advantage of the situation, but sells himself the entire time.  This is a powerhouse performance, one that rises in the ranks with me the more I see it.  I think that Hanks' performance is also a reason why I hate the ending of the film.  He was doing such a riveting job that I really wanted him to sink his teeth into Chuck's `afterlife' SOOOOO much (no, he doesn't die...by afterlife I meant `life after his rescue').

If I could reshoot or reedit this film I would be so happy.

Anyways, in the end `Cast Away' is a very good film.  It has been mentioned (and I agree) that this film lacks a tad of the emotional punch (emotional `human' punch) that it tries to convey, but I feel that that punch would have been achieved had Chuck's story continued.",1267488000,,2575,4.438297872340425
1282624,5,B00003CXRO,"After FedEx systems engineer Chuck Noland is ripped out of his hasty life by the clock in a plane crash, he finds himself alone on the shores of a tropical island. First, frustration gets to him and then he realizes how little his chances are to ever get back to civilization. Four years later, Chuck has learned very well how to survive on his own: mending his dental health, catching fish with a spear, predicting the weather with a self-made calendar. A photograph of his girlfriend Kelly has kept his hopes alive all these years. Finally, Chuck takes the opportunity to take off for home: He sets off on a wooden raft with a sail that has washed ashore. From director Robert Zemeckis comes this powerful character study of a man and his quest for survival. A fascinating, believable, and thought-provoking portrait of a man and his fight to live, with a remarkably ideal performance from Hanks, and steady, effectively leisure direction that allows you in this movie to accompany this resilient survivor on his emotionally wrenching journey. A fantastic movie.",1266537600,,1064,4.883977900552487
1282726,1,B00003CXRO,"The transfer of this wonderful movie is pitiful, Fox should be ashamed of ripping off their loyal customers with these poor quality Blu Ray Movies. This movie is not even that old. It looks grainy, the blacks are off and the lines are blurry at times. DO NOT BUY, THE DVD LOOKS BETTER. I do not think I will buy a Fox movie until they start remastering  and get their act together, perhaps if enough people stop buying, they will start releasing these masterpieces in a quality format.",1263686400,9,485,4.511363636363637
1282727,5,B00003CXRO,"We are taught to believe that our future is determined by the choices we take and miss and although that is true in a way, I have come to realize that many important paths in my life had been chosen in a more coincidental way.

From the minute he gets to the island every single decision he takes has to comply to the laws of nature. This is something is not apparent when you live in a society but the truth is that you are as confined as he was in the island. There is a beautiful shot of him at the top of the hill overlooking everywhere and only seeing the ocean, it makes you feel so insignificant and powerless.
You want to believe you are the owner of your destiny but you aren't. Life can and will take you to places  you never expected to be.

I might be in a minority here, but I really like this movie. Without saying much it speaks a thousand words to me.
I am extremely grateful to everyone who participated in creating this movie and I am glad they did it as real as possible, no music on the background to dramatize scenes in the island. Tom Hanks never overplayed the part and I know I would go through the same feelings if I was in the same situation.

In fact no wildlife at all other than some kind of silly lizard and a porpoise.  Did they not want to pay off the animal rights loonies or what?

It is a nice, a good, nice, film as few can make better than the talented Tom Hanks, Now, I am not saying that Tom Hanks is personally a nice guy, I don't know him. I am saying that as John Wayne, with a big assist from John Ford, created John Wayne who played John Wayne roles superbly, so Tom Hanks has created Tom Hanks, the character who can play a variety of nice guys in diverse situations. The film has been described in detail so I am left with, happily, simply the task of voicing my opinion that one comes away from the film knowing that a star has, with the help of Helen Hunt with not much to do but doing that very well, wrought his spell once more and left me, at any rate, with a good feeling as I got up out of my chair to take the DVD out of the machine and put it into its case to contribute to our resident's library with the assurance that other old timers will get the same pleasure out of it as I did.",1254355200,,971,3.934010152284264

1282735,1,B00003CXRO,"The first disconnect involves the physics of the jet hitting the water and the resulting vectors of anything with mass, which certainly includes our hero. OK, the film's director/advisers never took physics in school. The second is the raw fact that this situation would have taxed the skills of an experienced survivalist. This nerd wouldn't have had a chance.
However, the circuit-breaker is the volleyball, Wilson, and all of the invested emotions surrounding it. It's a tragedy when it is lost at sea? Seriously?
Why not have the protagonist adopt an orphaned (deformed/crippled) baby bird, for instance. Imagine a fragile and utterly dependent entity filled with energy, song, and the joy of each new sunrise. Now imagine this crippled little life that you'd carefully nursed and nurtured for years; your entire reason for surviving, blown out to sea and lost in a maelstrom because of a moment of exhausted inattention.

This solitude could have sown a deep spirituality and profound respect for all life. Did our boy grow to honor the lives that gave him life? Obviously not, as he callously throws down the crab's leg and takes no notice of the other wasted lives at the company's banquet.
Solitude can be a path to enlightenment, as it has for many of history's sages. Our hero? He moons around his old, now married, girlfriend? He mopes around hotel rooms speaking of loss? He had no substance to lose, except adipose...

No Paradise Lost or found here. No Milton. No counterfeit Rousseau.

Robert Zemeckis is on top of his game here and deserves as much credit for what isn't in the film as for what is.  And the music...oh God, the music.  It's notable for not existing till almost the end, but by then you're ready for it.  It says it all, carries it right over the top, speaks to a place inside beyond the movie.  You will know what it means to be 'cast away', if you dare.

So what about Cast Away.  I think it's a pretty good movie, a little long but then a lot happens.

Watching Tom Hanks learn how to survive on the island was educational.  I found myself asking, ""Do I know how to make fire?""  ""Do I know how to find water?""  Crazy questions I guess every should ask.

The setting of the island was beautiful yet with an ironic twist.  By that I mean scenicly it is beautiful, but absent are all things that make life worth living, namely companionship(no offense Wilson)

The love story at the end was painful and when the two were looking at each other in the rain it was like they wanted to kiss more than breathe.

I'm seeing this in other movies, too. Some films, like the Pirates of the Carribean series are so sharp they makes your eyes hurt. Cast Away looked so much like the regular DVD version I though I'd bought the old format version.

I'm convinced there must be a cheap fast way and an expensive right way to issue a blu-ray film, and I'm convinced the studio took the easy way out on this one. Since I've got both version it's easy to compare, and sad to say, the blu-ray isn't worth the money. It's an awesome story, but I expected more from the blu-ray experience. Other movies do.",1213920000,11,832,4.253164556962025
1282919,5,B00003CXRO,"Aristotle once wrote that man is a social animal.  That this passage has been translated as man is a ""political"" animal is beside the point.  The main point is the same, which is that our lives are defined by the people whom we spend them with.

Tom Hanks portrays a FED EX executive.  In his line of work, time is everything.  Time is what defines the parameters of his organization's business model.  After an airplane crash, he ends up stranded on a tropical island where time has no meaning at all.  It doesn't matter whether today is Tuesday or Saturday as there is no difference between the one and the other.

What is worse is that heis also totally alone, cut-off from civilization.  His only ""companion"" is a soccer ball that FED EX was trying to ship across the world.  For those who think this silly, I would challenge you to put yourself in his shoes and see how long YOU would last in isolation w/out going nuts!  There is some very nice symbolism in the film when it is finally time for him to let go of the soccer ball.

This is both a depressing and an uplifting film, both at the same time.  The movie doesn't drag on, which is one worry that I had when I picked it up.  The pacing is good and there always seems to be something that draws your interest in the story.  In short, another fine Tom Hanks flick!",1212796800,,1325,4.3076923076923075

Hanks is the best thing in this film, his acting is remarkable, only he could pull off this quiet but intense performance. Helen Hunt is miscast and so is Chris Noth. Cast Away is worth a viewing, so check it sometime.",1210636800,2,497,4.081632653061225
1282921,5,B00003CXRO,"I can think of only a handful of movies that have their audiences cheering the indefatigable resiliency of the human spirit.  ""Papillon"" certainly comes to mind, as does ""Bridge Over the River Kwai.""  CAST AWAY definitely can be added to such an elite list; director Robert Zemeckis and headliner Tom Hanks deliver an absorbing, intense story about one man's refusal to be involuntarily exiled for the remainder of his days.

Oh, the things we take for granted.  Running water.  Hot food.  A roof over our heads.  Imagine your predicament should you suddenly find yourself with none of these things--imagine your predicament if you had virtually no survival skills.  Such is the fate of Tom Hanks' character (a retentive, nondescript FedEx midmanager); one minute he's on a flight over the Pacific; the next he's on a secluded beach.  And thus both the character and the audience embark on a journey of discovery, as neither the cast away nor those viewing this film know how the survivor will be able to. . .survive.

Accordingly, the conflict of the plot stubbornly yields to a series of victories--the audience and the character are simultaneously elated:  elated when that first coconut is opened; when that first fire is started; when--after four long, solitary years--a durable raft is built that will transport its lone passenger beyond the unforgiving barrier reef.  And finally, following rescue, following the aftermath of a disheartening, yet poignant, reunion with a former lover (Helen Hunt makes the most out of this small, yet powerful, role), the audience celebrates when Hanks' character stands at the crossroads of a desolate Texas intersection--literally in the middle of nowhere.  For the viewers realize, as does the character, that following four years of rugged survival under harsh conditions, any subsequent obstacles or decisions are gravy.  Pure gravy.

Tom Hanks singlehandedly and wonderfully carries this movie.  He's believable, compelling, empathetic--funny.  This is easily one of his signature roles; and CAST AWAY is a signature celebration of the indomitable human spirit.

1283030,5,B00003CXRO,"""Castaway"" (with Tom Hanks) was a good movie until the end, when it grabs the brass ring of greatness (in my humble opinion).

It wasn't enough that he survived the island.  (And remember, he didn't get out by just hanging on;  he found a way to get beyond the reef.)  He must now decide if he is going to survive the loss of the love of his life.

If you have ever realized you let go of a great love, then you understood what was great about it.  You have the chance to take that realization, growth, and self-awareness to your next relationship, making it worlds better that the first.  But its not that easy.

It takes courage to move on and trust that the future contains unknown miracles. Ironically, that courage may be the thing your next love finds most attractive about you.

I absolutely adore the last scene.  He is literally at a crossroads in the middle of nowhere.  He must chose between a misery to which he is completely entitled, or once again, scraping together whatever courage he can find.

I imagine that he turns his car around, and drives back toward the woman with the wings (another great metaphor).  We don't know if they start a relationship.  But it doesn't really matter because we know he will continue to find the courage to move on.

Of course, I imagine that they do.  I imagine that she initially sees him as an odd, mildly attractive man of her own age.  They discuss the package he left at her door, which leads to an offer of iced tea and a  discussion of his experience on the island which takes all afternoon and into the evening.

Hanks is on a fedex job on Christmas Eve that he really doesnt want to do, but he does it as he is a workaholic. The plane crashes, and Hanks survives with the many packages in transit.

It was a good movie, worth seeing, but I wouldnt own it as I know seeing it once I wouldnt be in the mood to see it again.",1205107200,,571,3.9565217391304346
1283036,4,B00003CXRO,"One can make a case that Cast Away was Robert Zemeckis' last great film. After the underrated Contact, he focused attention on making a story in which for a good chunk of the movie, there's no dialogue or score. Whereas nowadays he seems more concerned with testing his new expensive toys (CG technology) than combining it with a story which he always did so well. It's not exactly one of the best of his career and if it wasn't for the main performance, it probably wouldn't mean much but that being said, it's good for what they managed to pull off.

Chuck Noland is a FedEx employee obsessed with time and making sure packages are delivered in a speedy manner. With a girlfriend, Kelly, he's planning on marrying, life seems alright until a late Christmas delivery has to be made and while en route, his plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean. Entirely alone on an empty island, the once time-obsessed Chuck now has too much of it and has to learn how to survive.

Cast Away on my first viewing when it first came out was one of those movies that I liked but didn't necessarily love outright. But now and then, there's that desire to re-watch a movie again to refresh your memory or just to see how well it holds up. The film does hold up pretty well and you got to give it to the filmmakers for actually holding our attention for the whole film with no cinema conventions. And credit has to go to Tom Hanks who manages to hold our attention all on his own and even make the scenes where he pretends to talk to a volleyball not feel silly. Plus there's his dramatic weight loss he did to further add to the realism and his Oscar nom was well deserved.

If there's some scenes that bring the film down slightly are the non-island scenes where he's about to leave and when he returns home. It's necessary to show his life and daily activities before he gets stranded but you still feel slight cutting down was in order. The post-island scenes are also polarizing since they do feel different and almost alien-feeling to the island but with the film at a relatively healthy 2 h 15 minutes sans credit, it feels like it does take awhile before we get to the ending though I like how it leaves on a slightly ambiguous note.

With a terrifying plane crash sequence, a compelling middle section though slightly inferior bookends, the film is good though because the film is better that doesn't make it amazing but considering what it could've been, I'm glad it's this way.",1204329600,,2466,4.485523385300668
1283037,5,B00003CXRO,"What we have here is over 2 hours of film, the bulk of which involves a single actor at a single location with very little in the way of dialog. Heck, one of the most important characters in the film is a volleyball. This is also a great demonstration as to how a good creative team can take something like that and make it work so amazingly well.

I'm not sure this could have worked with any actor other than Tom Hanks. Many actors would love to boast that they alone could carry a film, but here Tom Hanks actually does just that by effectively playing the sole character in the film for roughly 3/4ths the films total length.

The sense of realism represented in the film in pretty much every respect is amazing. I've never been in a plane crash, but I imagine the depiction we see here has more basis in reality than the flashy effects sequences usually see in film. I also loved that they didn't try to make the island out to be some tropical paradise with postcard shots and filtering. It's obviously a nice location, but they appropriately didn't emphasize that as that would negatively effect the films atmosphere. The trials he faces are a tad basic, but yet the two hours flies by before you know it due to a great script and an amazing performance from Hanks. The score is also minimalistic, likely because filling the scenes with music might effect the sense of isolation you are supposed to have. All in all I loved the art direction they took with the film.

The metal case this version of the film arrives in is great. The insert is nothing amazing but they did well with the special features. Sure, they're nothing that will leave you in awe, but it's enough to give you some insight on the films production and regarding the subject matter itself. I was a huge skeptic when I first heard about this one, but through an amazing creative team and a great performance by Hanks I can hardly imagine them pulling it off any better.",1203120000,,1944,4.455056179775281

1283148,4,B00003CXRO,"I purchased this on Blu-ray rather quickly after its release; especially because of the quite positive review written on highdefdigest.com.  When I put the movie in to watch, I was quite surprised that I disagreed often with that review.  They gave the picture five out of five stars.  I would give it maybe 3 1/2 out of five.

Cast Away is a great film, and it's hard not to like Hanks' performance.  His entertaining interaction with his environment despite its desolation of other humans is reason enough to watch the film, and he truly pulls us in to feeling the same as he does: lonely and nearly hopeless.  Most of the film involves Hanks and no one else, but the lack of socialization does not mean lack of engrossing material.  A+ for story and acting.

Since most people are probably interested in this Blu-ray edition for picture and audio reasons, I will give my honest feelings.  I think that the picture is quite inconsistent, with plenty grain, blurred backgrounds, and sometimes dull colors.  This surprised me because of the film's location.  We would expect everything on a tropical island to blow us away on film (Into the Blue is a great example of high definition oceanic beauty), but plenty of times it fails to wow.  As for inconsistencies, the Cast Away can look stunning at times, only to immediately follow up with blur or grain.  If you are interested in stunning photography, don't expect to see it often.  For this reason, I'm quite disappointed (it should have been restored better).

There's no complaining on the audio.  This film was nominated for an Oscar for sound, and the Blu-ray displays the audiophile prestige in its full glory.  If you have surround sound and want to truly test its ability, get this film.

Overall, I am glad that I purchased this Blu-ray.  The film is great, and for whatever reason, this is the first copy of the film I've owned.  If you are in the same situation, and you like this film, get the Blu-ray.",1200182400,2,1965,4.673469387755102

1283150,3,B00003CXRO,"I own movies in both HD DVD and Blu-Ray formats so I've seen very many HD movies and am well familiar with the formats capabilities.

Being one of my favorite movies, Cast Away's release in Hi-Def got me very excited. I'm a big fan of the movie and give the movie itself 5 stars but am only reviewing the quality of this release here. The opening sequence where the FedEx truck drives up and picks up the package for delivery to Russia looks only slightly better than the standard DVD. When the truck opens up and the Russia scene starts it looks a lot better, but still more like 720p quality. Through the rest of the movie the HD quality stays about the same, decent but not great. It's certainly a step up from DVD but there are a few scenes that seem to be no better than my 2 disc DVD edition. The best looking scenes are the closeup scenes where the HD quality becomes more apparent but it still doesn't look anywhere near as good as other HD titles I own. Some of the best looking HD titles I own are: The Matrix collection, 2001, The Fifth Element, Apollo 13, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Pirates of the Caribbean, and number of others.

While watching the movie and examining the quality I came to the thought that it might not be the transfer that's the issue but possibly it was the director of photography's filming. It looks like the DP tried hard to keep a balance of focus between the actor and the background thereby not getting a truly sharp focus. I could be wrong but this is what it looked like. The 5.1 surround sound was fantastic. I didn't notice any difference between my DVD and Blu-ray versions, though I do admit I really didn't examine the audio.

Overall the movie was nice but I was let down as I was expecting better, especially from a movie with such a great environment. If you own the 2 disc DVD keep in mind the 2 disc set has all those extras and this hi-def release does not. So you may want to hold onto your set. Don't go getting Cast Away expecting the same HD quality you see in all those top notch movies that people use to showcase the format. It still looks great and certainly better than DVD just not leaps and bounds better for most of the scenes. Again, I can't say for sure but it may simply have been the way it was filmed.

1283153,5,B00003CXRO,"Many have written great reviews of this awesome movie.  I just watched it twice again the last couple of days and have found things I missed in earlier viewings.  This film definitely makes my list of films that I can watch again and again.

Its fairly easy to perfunctorily view this film as a simple plot line: that is, man crashes in airplane, survives on island, loses lots of weight, grows beard, builds raft, gets back home, but, alas, not the ending he thought it could be. To view and absorb this movie on this superficial level is a waste of the art and symbolism that it contains.

That's where the spiritual aspect of this film comes in that so many viewers have missed.  There is a great deal of spiritual symbolism on a deeper level.

One reviewer thought it was weird that Tom Hanks made an imaginary friend in a Wilson Volleyball.  This is not strange at all.  I surmise that viewers that think along these lines have never spent great stretches of time alone without human contact.  To them I say, go camping alone for a month somewhere where you will not see people and you might begin to understand how ""Wilson"" helped keep Hanks alive.

SYMBOLISM

OK OK what is this symbolism I am speaking of???  The very last scene of the movie breaks us over the head with symbolism.  Hanks is standing in the flattest of the flat parts of Texas at a crossroads. Literally, he does not know what road to take.  Figuratively, metaphorically, his entire life is at a crossroads.  Chuck Logan has learned something new though.  He has been transformed by his experience and has learned how to listen to some voice deep inside instead of rushing around like a Fed Ex mad man.  He waits, contemplates until he feels his guide, the inner man, help him on his way.  This IN ESSENCE, is what this film is all about.

THE WHALE:

Whats with the whale and the spraying of the water.  Some people have missed that the spraying of the water is actually THE WHALE that has followed along with Hanks on the raft and has sprayed him, that is, woken him up out of his coma, at very key moments.  Some may think:  WOW, that is really far fetched.  Well then, I challenge you to go on a whale watch yourself if you have never done so.  When a whale comes as close to you as was accurately portrayed in this movie, raises its head out of the water, and its eye looks in yours and your eyes look into its eye, you can only come to one conclusion:  you are looking into the eye of an intelligent and sentient being that is quite capable of staying with Hanks.  Sailors have reported these experiences with whales time and again.

No one has written about the GOLD WINGS symbol that Chuck Logan says saved his life.  Yes, that symbol saved his life but also Wilson saved his life, Kelly saved his life, the watch saved his life, and Chuck Logan saved his life by recognizing his powerlessness and transforming his life.",1194134400,12,2903,4.434782608695652
1283154,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast away is weird. Weird when Tom Hanks befriends a volleyball, weird when he yells at the volleyball, weird when he constantly gets splashed by water on his makeshift raft ( as though a stagehand was simply throwing water off camera.) Mostly, weird when you realize that the movie manages to make a strong statement amongst the hours of survival ""what not to-do's"". that is, that life in unpredictable.

Tom Hanks' character has all the priorities down. His job, time, working, and lastly his girlfriend/hope for fiance (Helen Hunt). When his Fed Ex plan goes down in the Pacific Tom's character has to find a way to live, for a long time on an island by himself with no supplies. This technical part of the movie is very interesting. Loneliness, desperation, fear, and pain make up the 4+ years he's stranded on the island.

After fashioning a raft to escape on he's found adrift by a large shipping vessel. After getting home you see where his lesson lies ( although for some it may take too long to get there) that life is unpredictable, time waits for no man, and finally what really matters keeping your priorities straight.

He realizes to take the work trip instead of staying home started the hole series of events. He realizes that if he had stayed home and never took the business trip he would be probably married to the girl of his dreams. Life is like that, you cant plan it. After seeing his ex fiance married with kids he realizes he just has to go on surviving, as a well written monologue at the end points out.

I like that at the end, he is able to deliver one of the Fed Ex boxes he found after the crash. It belongs to a lady that started out the movie sending art to her husband overseas, whose cheating on her. By the end of the film you see the husband is out of the picture, she divorced him. She see's Tom at a crossroads and, after giving directions Tom realizes shes the lady who owns the ranch/art atudio and the last shot is of him looking at all the roads to take, metaphorically choosing his path, and he ends up looking down the road the lady just left on. Hinting that theres a reason for everything.

Thats where the message lies. Accept your decisions, becuase as you look back if even one thing is differe nt you wouldnt be where you are. Tom's character has to go through a lot but the ending really does hint at the fact that with the artist lady, is where he was always meant to be. Pretty cool.",1188691200,2,2437,4.394678492239468

My only gripe about the film is, I wish they would have shown a bit more of Hanks' on the island.  He was there for FOUR years and the way it was filmed, it jumps from the beginning of his new life, to shortly before he is finally saved.  I would have liked to have seen a bit more of the time in between.  I can understand however because it was a lengthy movie as is and that would have only made it longer.

Maybe because life is so hurried and harried, I just like how this movie slows you down, strips away the many layers of life, and exposes a bit of the seed within. There's no rush. No animals attacking him on the island. No pirates. No frenetic struggle. Just the quiet struggle of a man who decides to keep going, to keep breathing. The camera lingers on scenes of silence, and somehow, it just works for me. The movie's messages that resonate with me are the acceptance of life's losses, the resolution to keep going despite those losses, the perseverence to continue hoping, and the ingenuity and imagination to explore new possibilities. The movie's score nicely accompanies these themes.",1180656000,3,803,4.868613138686132
1283229,4,B00003CXRO,"A good story, however, I wasn't pulled in until the plane crash and yes, it was a very good action scene.  Hanks committment and sacrifice (The weight loss) for this role should be commended.  (I'm still waiting for the heavy-set dude from Lost to lose weight).  I doubt I would have been able to survive four days let alone four plus years.  The bonding with the volleyball was sad yet totally understandable.  His determination to get off the island gives new meaning to ""never give up"" and his time adriff at sea was equally heart wrenching and incredibly lucky.  But then when we return to civilization, Chuck is still an island unto himself.  The insensativity of catering seafood as a welcome home party was both amusing and sad.  Kelly unable to see him because it was too emotionally hard had to be one of the most selfish acts I've ever seen.  YOU had it hard?  At that point I didn't want him to reunite with her.  Sure, you've moved on and have a family now-you can explain all that but you at least show up.  I'm not complaining, these things all help you to continuely feel for our hero.  The speech Chuck gave to the theapist about keep breathing sort of reminded me of the same speech from Sleepless in Seattle.  About getting up every morning and breathing in and out.  I swear it's eerily similar.  That last bit of hope at the end of the movie, when he returns the one Fed-ex package confused me.  Because in the begining of the movie wasn't that lady married?  The package she sent to Russia was for her husband.  So was she single now?  I didn't know.  Other than that, Cast Away is an entertaining film that reminds viewers how quickly and unpredictable the tide of life can be.",1180310400,,1699,4.469055374592834
1283230,5,B00003CXRO,"This is a undoubtably a classic of our time. Now, with the new European packaging of ""steelbook"", this new DVD edition serves as a better investment and sure value-holding collection. The ""steelbook"" design has been introduced on several DVD sets in Germany and other European nations over the last several years. With movies like Ice Age 2 and The Grudge 2 just recently gone Steelbook form overseas, the new inovative packaging trend has just reach the US with the introduction of 9 previously released special edition sets--including the 2-Disc Collector's Edition of Cast Away.

Although this new packaging DVD set is not released, or at least scheduled to be, at the time I'm writing this review, I do assure you that I do have a copy of the Steelbook edition on hand (along with The Day After Tomorrow Steelbook as well). It is a nicely packaged set that really does bring more value to the collection. It's medal on the outside, with clear plastic on the inside. The bind itself is actually part of the plastic inside the two metal tin-like lids that close the book up, but it is very strong and plenty sturdy enough to balance the weight of the metal lids. This is not like a DVD case inside of a tin packaging that many of us have come to know over the years, but really both ideas placed into one packaging. The discs will surely be far better protected than the snapcases, keepcases, and digipaks that we know best.

The Steelbook edition of Cast Away is the same, but now OOP, 2-disc Special Collector's Edition released a couple of years ago by 20th Century Fox. Disc 1 is the exact same as the single released version of the movie (in Widescreen). Disc 2 contains the same bonus features as released before. For those wanting the 2-disc experience, you now have a second chance to grasp onto it (and the other movies) with a more lasting alternative.

With this newly packaged beautiful set, I do hope that other movies soon will be released after these nine come out June 5th. So far, these movies seem to be geared more toward the fellas with more action packaged/disasterous themed movies. Hopefully, we'll begin to see other movies like Ice Age 2, Dirty Dancing, and even Eragon come out in this new ""Steelbook"" format just as they have overseas.",1180224000,5,2264,4.669172932330827

With one of the best and most believable crash sequences ever put on film, were gone the love-of-his-life and his career. In no particular order. Tom Hank's characters always seem to pull the audience in, making us care about what happens to them. The sounds of being stranded on a desert island, waves hitting the sand, give that sense of realism and feeling all alone. Great effort from the sound effects crew. And after too many years in isolation, he pretty much loses it with the loss of his one companion ""Wilson"".

I guess the one complaint expressed by many, not myself, was the even bigger disappointment he suffered after returning to civilization. Extremely touching, with the falling rain a symbol of the many years of tears and separation. But there is also the positive side. An ending with the hope of a new beginning.

Other things that took away from the film are: how coincidental that one of the boxes was a ball. He uses this ball to explain key things in the plot since there is no other way to explain it. How convenient one of the boxes contained ice skates, he later used for cutting coconuts. Also the VHS tapes supplied rope for his raft.

Once there, it is his thoughts of his loved one and of home that provide him with the necessary strength to endure unprecedented difficulties.

Cast Away is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, and inner strength.

Tom Hanks is superb in his role as Chuck Noland, and although the rest of the cast do not have that many lines in the movie, nevertheless, they have outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!

The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all good!

In short, Cast Away is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1174694400,,931,4.75776397515528
1283234,5,B00003CXRO,"My only major beef I had with this movie was the way it was marketed. Thanks to the trailers and previews to the film, we knew that Chuck Noland would in fact be rescued from the island. However, even with that said, the previews didn't really spoil the movie. Though it would have made the message(s) that much more powerful if they didn't give that much of it away.
Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland; A FedEx efficiency engineer who flies around the world at a moments notice to troubleshoot whatever problems the company is having at any given place. Helen Hunt plays his loving girlfriend / fiance, Kelly, who is very understanding of Chuck Noland's plight.
One day, just before Christmas, Chuck is called away to Malaysia. This is when Chuck Noland's life takes a sudden and dramatic turn as his plane (most realistically) crashes into the ocean. As the only survivor, he washes up on shore of a small, isolated island in the south Pacific.
This is a film that really forces the viewer to relate to the main character. On the surface, Chuck is not a guy most people would relate to; He has a high paying job which he actually seems to enjoy on some level, and a girlfriend he is completely in love with. His life is as good as it can get up until the tragic plane crash. Now his life is turned upside down as he struggles to find the basic needs of survival. There are no cuts to the rescue efforts, no ""meanwhile, back in Memphis"" scenes. It's all Chuck on the island for the second act of the film.
There are four basic needs of survival. Most people know about the first three: Food, Water and Shelter. Chuck realizes that companionship is really the fourth need, which he finds in the form of a vollyball he calls ""Wilson"".
The aquisition of food, water and shelter are all epic struggles for Chuck Noland as we see him try to break open coconuts with rocks and make fire to cook crabs. We suffer with him as he does his own dental work. This goes on for four years...
Finally, one day a piece of metal (from the plane?) washes up on the island and it gives Chuck an idea of how to escape. He builds a raft out of Coconut trees and uses the piece of metal as a sail to escape from the island. He spends several days out on the ocean hoping to be rescued. Along the way, he losses his only friend of the last four years, Wilson, in a strange but very emotional scene. Shortly thereafter, on the brink of death from dehydration, he is rescued.
In any other movie, this would be the happy ending. But this is not any other movie. Chuck finds that Kelly has moved on with her life. And now he must find a way to move on with his.
When he first arrived on the island, he only needed to find ways to physically survive, but now rescued, he needed to find ways how to emotionally survive in a world that moved on without him.
The final scene, just before the credits roll, reveals the most powerful moral I have ever seen in a movie. This is a film that proves that no matter how much suffering, pain, or tragedy that someone may go through, their life will always be worth living. And it does so without invoking religion or astrology or any other kind of pseudoscience. This is a moral and spritual film that all people can relate to in some way or another.",1173571200,4,3253,4.32569558101473
1283335,4,B00003CXRO,"An excellent dramatic performance by Tom Hanks.  You can't underestimate how difficult it must have been for him to hold the audience all on his own (I don't think the volleyball counts as a character).  His display of fear, dementia, hopelessness, and loneliness is genuine and powerful.  The depths of his sorrow are unbelievably well-delivered.  By the same token, his moments of hope and happiness are both believable and imaginable.  One of Tom Hanks' best performances, easily.",1173398400,4,483,5.220779220779221

On an island by yourself having to do whatever it takes to survive can be a serious struggle, and that's what the film is about- trying to find ways to survive.  I love everything about this movie.  I would love to see it again.  I recommend this film to just about everyone.  Even if you're a fan of horror movies, take a break from that and watch this great movie.  It's not a horror flick obviously, but it's worth your time.",1172880000,,706,4.343511450381679
1283338,5,B00003CXRO,"This riveting movie further confirms Tom Hanks' greatness as an actor. Everything he does is imbued with such honesty and truth. Furthermore, he makes every reaction to his situation seem believable. You do not get the sense of a star trip here. You are made to feel being there with him on that desert isle, terrified for him, rooting for him, and feeling his forlorn sorrow and loneliness. His effortless way of reaching out - without trying to - is often deeply moving. Hanks' enactment of the character's metamorphosis is stunningly worked out, yet uncalculating, organic. The one sly factor in Hanks' persona is his subtle, yet absolutely uproarious sense of humor: he indicates certain touches, ways of registering a situation with such deft irony you're laughing along with your tears. Few actors are more spontaneously skilled than Hanks in registering a human emotion that everyone can relate to. The greatest gift an actor can have is the ability to make the audience feel, understand and react to, the character's emotions; and only an actor who is real, and genuine and borne of an inborn simplicity of truth can really hope to reach audiences on such a universal level. Tom Hanks is undoubtedly in the elect. Perhaps no other actor today has that hallmark, Jimmy Stewart-like appeal as does Hanks.

You can feel Chuck Noland's frustration level build as nothing seems to be going right, and he finally crashes emotionally when his only friend on the island (a volleyball named Wilson) floats out to sea.

When he is finally rescued, he discovers that his fiancee has moved on with her life, and he is in effect, cast away again. The movie ends with a ray of hope, but Chuck's future is still uncertain.

As a theistic individual, I kept wondering, ""Where is God in this film? Why doesn't Chuck call on the Lord? Even when he buries the pilot of the crashed plane, he simply pauses by the tomb and says ""So that's it."" No acknowledgment of a sovereign Creator.

Even at the end of the film when Chuck relates the things he has learned, there is no mention of the Divine at all. I can't imagine being in the situation that Chuck was in without ever once looking to the Lord for help.

But even so, something stirred inside me as I was watching this film. I don't know if it was the weepy strings in the movie's soundtrack, the vastness of the ocean, or the ordeal of the man. But it is a film that sticks to your mind like a good meal sticks to your ribs. I recommend it heartily and highly.

1283343,4,B00003CXRO,"About 90% of the film you only see one actor, one person on the screen: no one else expect that one man...
But even though he is the only one, it gives the movie such a powerfull feeling and emotion created by that man and the place he is on, that those 90% of the film is the thing that is keeping you watching till the very end of the credits.

Tom Hanks gives the performace of a Life time. He is the perfect choice to play the stranded man who lives on a totally deserted island for a long time. His acting is what keeps the movie alive for sure. If they had put an actor in this leading role that couldn't act, the movie wouldn't have been that maqnificent at all.

The power of the film lies in the lonelyness. Tom Hanks' character is totally alone on the island as he tries to survive. The brilliance also lies in the sounds of the island. It was a terrific move of the filmmakers to have no music at all when the main character is on the island. You will only hear the sea, the wind and the sounds the character makes. It gives a sense of pure realism and it gives the feeling that you are right there with him.
But when there is music, Alan Silvestri has composed a brilliant theme that brings the emotion up in you.
And if you have 5.1 surround sound like I have, the sounds and the music will be an even greater experience.

It looked like a impossible task: making a film that would actually work where there is only one character on the screen, where there is no music, and where the location is but one place. But believe me: they have pulled it off for sure. My congrats to the filmmakers!

So get ready for an experience of a lifetime. If you like emotional films that keep you interested till the very end, then I deeply reccomend you this motion film! Get those tissues ready, and be pulled into the world of ""Cast Away"", a film you won't forget and leaves an everlasting memory in your mind.",1157760000,7,1910,4.1961852861035425
1283344,4,B00003CXRO,"I watched this film again in anticipation of Hanks in The DaVinci Code. And I was amazed at how much I reacted this movie after 2 years. Unlike others, I don't like to give away the film. Details can sometimes make it so the film doesn't need to be seen. I prefer to express the emotion in this movie.

At the time this film was released, everyone compared it to Hanks performance in Forest Gump. And I did also. But now, after watching it again, I see the similarities and the differences.

Gump was a series of vignettes. A `slower' person haphazardly thrown into historical situations. Castaway, in a quick capsulation, is the end of a man's life due to being stranded on an uncharted island after a plane crash, the loss of the love of his life, and in the final minutes, realizing he has a whole new life to begin. A life with more possibilties than his previous one.

Chuck Noland of FedEx, unknowing leaves his life behind when he boards a a plane. The plane goes down and he survives on an island well out of the shipping lanes and travelled waters. The fact that he survives is a miracle. Hanks is superb in the transformation of personalities that surface. At first, he is the civilized clot who has no idea what to do. Then he realizes the hopelessness of his situation (punctuated by a panaramic view of his tiny island from a summit), and succumbs to this hopelessness of his situation with a suicide attempt. When the attempt fails, he accepts his doom as lost soul. Until he is able to create fire. And then, he assumes the role of a survivor. The key is a Volleyball (whom he dubs Wilson due to it's maker) marked by his own bloodly hand. This connection of blood, creates the alterego Hanks imprints upon Wilson. While it appears he is going insane, this is the key to his surviving, as well as his love for his fiance, played by Helen Hunt. His transformation from dweeb to survivor (the scenes with his impacted tooth are wrenching), are a parellel to real life, telling the viewer to never give up, no matter what the odds.

It is the ending, after his rescue, that truly affected me. The realization of both he and Hunt, that their lives had moved on, was at the least, powerfully emotional.

It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as the year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.

This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film, the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.

Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight.

Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.

The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading. Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances. He is rescued, but after four years the life he left behind has all but disappeared.

Over View

Tom Hanks (one of the best actors ever and my personal favorite) is Chuck who is a workaholic. During Xmas he decides to work and is shipwrecked. He has to survive and tries to get back home.

Why it is good.

It is a simple story. A majority of the film features Tom by himself on the island. He can hold the screen with no other actors, just by himself. Chuck's situation is a thought provoker. It makes you envision what you would do in his place  and that life is not fair but you have to ""breath everyday"" and there is a bittersweet ending. There is a sweet message in the movie.

Maybe not for everyone.

Since Hanks is by himself a large part of the movie, there is not too much action sequence which might bore people.",1145836800,4,760,4.2

As Fed-X employee Chuck, Hanks is stranded on a deserted island after a plane crash and is left to fend for himself woth no one to keep him company but a ball named Wilson for four years.  Watching him survive may not sound like watchable entertainment but it is, it truly is, and when he's finially able to make it home your cheering for him because you feel like you know him and you missed him and your so happy he made it out alive.

1283440,4,B00003CXRO,"I picked ""Cast Away"" with some hesition = previous

effort by Zemeckis and Hanks - ""Forrest Gump"" was

annoying, calculated and syrupy feel-good movie that

was constantly tugging your sleeve to nag you ""oh -

please - feel TOUCHED by this movie"". ""Forrest Gump"" was

OK and entertaining - but emotionally did nothing for me.

So I was pleasently surprized by ""Cast Away"" (which I

finally watched on DVD). Zemeckis managed to keep  the

sentimental part under control and let the story unfold

and speak for itself (kudos for last scene!).

Hanks acting and reality of the life on a small island

is done very, very well. I especially liked the distance

surrounding him after his return.

It is a solid, entertaining movie that respects your IQ

and delivers the package. You finish it and you feel that

it left you bit richer and not wasted two hours of your life.",1135987200,5,868,4.6490066225165565

Director Robert Zemeckis could have tightened the film a bit here and there, but ""Cast Away"" is still an engaging adventure story about how the will to live can help us survive.",1129248000,,485,4.426966292134831

And he did well in this role as well. A lot of the movie is very quiet when he is on the island and you just watch him trying to survive alone on the island. I always worried there would be a threatening person or creature on the island that would eventually attack him but I guess they thought that Tom Hanks being alone on the island was more dramatic, and I could see that. This film has a feeling of great lonliness and that was the point and they did it well. And then at the end when he goes back home, not everything is perfect, or a happy ending. It's just an ending, that signifies a new beginning for Hank's character. A very realistic ending, and I was glad to see that.

Overall I really did like this film. It's not the sort of film I always watch but Tom Hanks made it work to be an interesting film, and for most of the time a quiet one- and it's not easy for a film to be both interesting AND quiet so yes good job Cast Away.",1128729600,,1131,3.917391304347826

OK, I'll tell you a bit more. Tom Hanks is some work-obsessed jobsworth postal worker guy who MUST deliver all his packages in record time (clearly a work of complete fiction), and, oh-ho - in one of life's little ironies, he gets trapped on a desert island.

Now, the thought of Tom Hanks running around in little more than a loin cloth for more than an hour wasn't exactly appealing to me either, but I stuck with it. I really wish I hadn't.

The stuff on the island is decent enough, but then of course ol' Tom goes nuts. He finds a football washed up on shore and it becomes his best friend. He paints a face on it, gives it a name and has full blown conversations with it.

But then, the really annoying part?  When he gets OFF the island, all traces, every single one, of madness are gone. He becomes a fully functioning human being again. So, er, what was the POINT OF THE WHOLE MOVIE THEN?????

Four years stranded on an island can leave us with much more than sand in our skin.

Four years can change our priorities.

The everyday commodities can mean nothing compared to the safety of knowing when we will drink a glass of ice water.

The necessity to relate to other people acquires a worthy value when, drowned in the deepest solitude, we start to talk to a volleyball.

And those are some of the hard lessons Chuck Noland learns.

Cast Away is a rather optimistic vision of how an ordinary man, obsessed with the clock, is forced to let go of the notion of time, physically and emotionally.

Tom Hanks is Chuck, a Fedex systems analyst; expert in problem-solving, in connecting people; for him, every minute counts, time is worth everything. A clock is crucial to the success of every task

And while his busy agenda keeps him in places like Russia, Asia or Paris, in Memphis his girlfriend Kelly waits for him.

One Christmas eve, Chuck has to go away again, leaving Kelly with the words ""I'll be right back"" floating in the air.

Life can be full of such ironies.

So, instead of coming back, Chuck's plane crashes and leaves him stranded on a desert island for four years.

Four years where surviving is the challenge. Learn to fish, to open a coconut, find a shelter, lit a fire, fight nature.

And then after overcoming all obstacles, what matters is live. So Chuck starts a rebirthing: talks to a volleyball, which he calls Wilson, and it's a sort of conscience to confide all his fears, frustrations and desires.

Finally, all the conditions are given for the survivor to return to civilization.

To a world that moved on, where time didn't stop, a world out of sync with Chuck.

Cast Away is brilliant showing us how irreversible is the past and how marked we are with our experiences.

Director Robert Zemeckis displays Chuck's life changes with a clean and simple technique. Overwhelming and busy at first, slow and full of silences during his isolation, reflexive and enigmatic at the end.

Hanks proves his effectiveness carrying the entire movie in his shoulders. Frenetic and exhausting when we meet him, he transmits his busy way of life. And he is equally persuasive and convincing when he goes to that exceptional situation, sympathetic and also worthy of compassion.

Chucks' spiritual changes are as obvious as his physical changes. He disconnects from reality and after four years, he loses that spark that shines in our eyes, result from our everyday contact with others.

And once his hope to return to his loved ones is given to him, how difficult is to find that you don't fit anymore in that life. What can one do?

The plane crash is truly amazing and terrifying, the island scenes great and the escape from the island / rescue will simply leave you drained. My biggest problem has to do with the long scenes between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt at the return of the movie, they're just frustrating as closure for the characters couldn't ever exist. To top this we get a touching but long an unncesary monologue well over 2 hours into the movie.

 In any other contempary actors hands this film would have been distinctly lack lustre. It is solitary and as such requires great emtional content which is visceral and believable, it also in need of great humanity and Hanks has the ability to deliver on all scores. You feel his isolation, frustration and fear in a way that is palpable and intense. His sense of alienation and irony is delivered with perfect pitch in the last section of the film and the film leaves one with a mixed sense of fear and hope, undoubtedly the main characters displaced internal dilemma.

 It may not be heavy on plot and action but this film is more about the extremes of the human condition and survival instinct and it also stands as an intense study of Hanks craft at it's best.",1117497600,3,1001,4.513812154696133

Confused? If so I apologize, but the movie I'm trying to write a ""worthy"" review of here being as moving and as brilliant as it is for being a movie with very limited dialogue and ""events"". Most of the movie taking place at a distant island far from the civilized world, where Hanks' character spends four years after a plane he's on crashes into the sea.

The silence and the loneliness he feels is brilliant described the way he builds up a relationship with a soccer ball that he paints a face with his blood on. What keeps him alive is the hope of seeing the love of his life again, and finally he takes the risk of setting out to the open ocean not wanting to die alone on that island. Four years as mentioned.

The movie is no lost-island-adventure-movie, not at all. It's a ""modern"" drama (though timeless I believe) without pirates and treasures. It seems to focuse on being as realistic as possible, and this way it makes it easy to imagine this mans' desperate situation.

Not wanting to give too much away here for those of you who haven't seen the movie, ""Cast Away"" has perhaps the sadest ending ever in the ""movie-history"". Ok, I'm a guy, but the ending here made it almost hard to breathe -and I doubt I'm the only guy who've felt that way seeing it.

So where some find ""Cast Away"" disturbingly boring others will find it moving and beautiful. As I did. Because of the fantastic acting (as usual by Tom Hanks, also by Helen Hunt playing his girlfriend), the way we get involved in the lives of the lead characters here -I'd say; Highly recommended!

1283762,5,B00003CXRO,"Oddly enough, I had to get over the hump of thinking ""a guy is on an island by himself with a vollyball.  How interesting can that be?"" before I could watch ""Cast Away"".  Yes, I knew it was a silly thought - after all, it was Tom Hanks playing that guy, and being alone on an island for years is rarely a holiday.

At the beginning, Chuck (Tom Hanks) is a very motivated FedEx systems manager who is very invested in making sure the international offices are up to speed on the philosophy of the company.  He travels often, in a cargo plane,  but is very dedicated to his PhD candidate girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) back in Memphis, the FedEx hub.  Around Christmas he returns from Russia and joins Kelly's family for a close, friendly Christmas dinner, but then gets called to a location past the South Pacific.  Immediately before boarding that flight he gives Kelly a box which we assume has an engagement ring and he tells her, ""I'll be right back"".

Then they hit a storm, head off course and the plane has an explosion.  To my claustrophobic eye, the plane crash is horrific and Chuck almost doesn't make it away from the sinking plane on his lifeboat.  *shudder*  Luckily, he and his lifeboat, nothing else, wash ashore on a tiny island just shortly after, sparing us scenes of desperate survival on the open sea before he hits land.

Chuck manages to figure out how to get water, crack coconuts, make fire, spearfish and devise a buddy, Wilson.  He has next to nothing- just the raft, his clothes, the contents of the very few FedEx boxes that float ashore, and an heirloom pocketwatch given him by Kelly for Christmas, with her picture inside.  Four years- (FOUR years!) later, he is lean, with toughened feet and a longstanding relationship with Wilson, a hunk of a porta-potty wall washes ashore and he has what he needs to make his escape.  He and Wilson build a raft and set off to wherever the wind takes them.

Other reviewers have included a spoiler on his relationship with Kelly- skip this if you don't know about that yet-  Of course Craig has high hopes for seeing Kelly since she is how he kept himself alive during his isolation.  But four years is a long time when others are trying to convince you someone is dead, and she eventually caved in and married their dentist.  It's quickly apparent that she still loves him, but he believes she needs to let go of him then- he says he is ""happy she was with him on the island"" and acknowledges her picture and memory were important to his survival.  He contemplates that he doesn't know what the tide might drag in- a reference to his porta-potty sail- and he feels it's important to move on with his life.  I'm not sure I agree, but at the same time, I can understand why someone would be unwilling to cause of breaking up Kelly's family.

The commentary on the second disk is interesting- the directors and screenwriters hired experts in stone age living and one of them spent some time living alone on the Baja where he made shelter, learned to catch food, learned to make fire, etc, in order to authentically write the the script for Chuck's survival.  The idea for ""Wilson"" came from that experience and it was their belief that a figure like that would be crucial to keeping a person sane during a solitary trial.  I haven't decided if that would be true for me though.

It's fascinating to contemplate how we would do in a situation like that.  How many of us believe we would have the motivation to keep breathing, to work every day to live off the tiny environment supplied by fate?  How many of us believe we would just lay down and give up?  This film can provide lots of good food for thought on sleepless nights, but preferably not on the over the water portion of international flights.",1115078400,,3768,4.509572901325479
1283763,3,B00003CXRO,"Okay what is our obesseion with being deserted on a tropical island that makes human-beings write books, make movies, and now even television shows about it? I suppose it's that we wonder what life would be like if everything we need to survive is taking away.

This movie starts out giving us a portrait of Chuck Nolan(Tom Hanks) the Fed-Ex worker who lives and dies by the clock. Chuck appears to be arrogant, smart mouthed, and fast on his feet. The one real good thing in Chuck's life is his girlfriend Kelly(Helen Hunt) who he has been in a long relationship. Well on Christmas Eve everything changes for Chuck- work driven he decides to go on a buisness trip over the up coming Holiday him and Kelly exchanging Christmas gifts in the car. When turbulance strikes the plane, the plane goes down crashing somewhere near the Cook Island- Hanks is suddenly alone being the only survior he learns to cope and make use of FedEx packages that wash ashore from the crash. At this point of desertion on the island you hear little to no dialouge which gives you a sense of solitude that Hanks is feeling except when he talks to a ball that he calls ""Wilson"" giving you the sense that he is craving for social interaction. Hanks struggles with difficult tasks from fishing to making fire. He is helpless. Until four years later, you see a much thinner Hanks, with a long beard, who has learned how to cope with what must be done on the island. Suddenly when a small piece of the wrekage washes ashore- Chuck makes the decision to use it as a sail and go out into the waters risk his life, rather stay on the island waiting to die. When Chuck is saved, by a passing ship he is returned a world he barely remembers anything about, except for Kelly- who is now married and has a child. Nolan's one reason for living on the island was- Kelly now, with that hope smashed he has to learn to survie the heartbreak to go on.

Tom Hanks gives a good performance as Nolan but, not his absolute best. Helen Hunt also does a good job as Kelly but, her role in ""Pay It Forward"" in my opinon was her best performance ever. With little to no dialogue in most of the movie, I couldn't help but feel that desertion for Hanks and even I found myself looking upon the ball ""Wilson"" that he talks to a good friend. This movie made me think about all the things I do have in my life and am grateful for. Who wouldn't want to be stuck on a deserted island with Hanks?

I also like the message contained in the movie when Hanks said ""Tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide will drag in,"" after he loses Kelly, he goes out to Texas so he can return a package he found on the island- the only one he couldn't open (for the fact it had this gorgeous butterfly painted on it) when, a woman stops to help him as he looks lost-telling him which roads lead to where. Suddenly, as she drives off Hanks sees a butterfly painted on the back of her truck- He smiles looking off as she drives off into the distance. I couldn't help but, think that is something the tide dragged in for Nolan and  that the two in the end ended up together.

I enjoyed this movie, but it's the kind of movie that will only touch you once. This is a movie I'd rent but, not buy.",1113955200,,3234,4.277777777777778
1283764,5,B00003CXRO,"With CAST AWAY, I think Tom Hanks reached a pinnacle of perfection in his role as Chuck Noland, the FedEx exec who gets stranded on a remote Pacific island.  Although Hanks had won two Oscars previous to this film, it is this performance that articulates Mr. Hanks' remarkable talents.  The performance is a brave one; Hanks had to undergo a considerable physical transformation and took a whole year to do that.  Working again with his Gump director Robert Zemeckis, Hanks is required to work solo for about an hour of the movie, with very little dialogue.  It allows the viewer to share in the experiences that he does, and it gives new insight to our romantic images of tropical islands and such.  Wilson the Volleyball is a wonderful addition as Tom's only ""companion"" on the island and when Wilson is lost at sea, Hanks' remorse is nearly devastating to him and the viewer.  The movie's third section is a little depressing in that Hanks' life has changed so much and his loss once again of Kelly (a sturdy but underused Helen Hunt) is heartbreaking.  The movie has some stunning visual images and the soundtrack by Alan Silvestri is great.  Hanks should have won the Oscar for Cast Away, losing it to an over-rated Russell Crowe.  But he sure doesn't have anything to be ashamed about.  He joins Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie) for the Oscar robberies of recent years.",1112313600,,1367,4.729957805907173
1283765,5,B00003CXRO,"I have been a huge Tom Hanks fan for many years and I have seen many of his movies, but I rate ""Cast Away"" as one of the best films he has ever made.  Directed by Robert Zemeckis (also the director of Forrest Gump), this film provides a touching look at love and the will to survive.

Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee, and Helen Hunt stars as Kelly, Chuck's fiancee.  On Christmas Eve, Chuck is scheduled to fly to the Far East on FedEx business, but while in flight, the plane encounters a terrible storm and they are forced to deviate from their original flight plan.  This course change takes them over 400 miles off course.  Even with the coruse change, the storm is still raging, and soon, the plane, damaged greatly by the effects of the storm, plunges into the Pacific Ocean.  Chuck is the only survivor.

For the next four years, Chuck is forced to struggle to survive on a deserted island far away from any shipping lanes or air routes.  He even draws a face on a volleyball from a FedEx package that washed up from the crash.  Naming the volleyball ""Wilson"", it becomes a companion for Chuck, who uses it to converse with and vent frustration.  Tired of fighting to survive on the island, Chuck finally decides to construct a raft which will hopefully be strong enough to get past the huge waves that surround the island.  With great strength and determination, Chuck finally makes it past the waves, but now he must hope for rescue on the open water.  After drifting for over 500 miles, Chuck is finally picked up by a ship and returned to civilization.

Upon returning home, he realizes that much of his former life has changed.  He is told that his fellow FedEx employees held a funeral for him when they thought he was dead, and his former fiancee Kelly is now married to another man and has a child of her own.  Chuck and Kelly meet and they profess that they still love one another, but Chuck realizes that they could never be together after so much had happened to both of them.

The ending is very symbolic to the message of the entire film.  It shows Chuck standing in a crossroads trying to decide which direction to go.  He is also probably trying to decide which direction to take with his life as well.

This is a great movie.  Tom Hanks is excellent as Chuck, and Helen Hunt gives a good performance as Kelly.  The scenes on the island are a little unusual because there is very little dialogue, but the message contained within these scenes is very powerful.  Watching Chuck struggle to do such regular and mundane things as light a fire or catch a fish are made even that much more remarkable without dialogue.  It allows the viewer to focus completely at the task Chuck is trying to complete.  I thought this aspect was very interesting to watch.  Other symbolic things in the movie included Chuck casually lighting a lighter and remembering his struggles trying to make fire, and picking up a crab leg and then immediately putting it back down after eating them for so long.

I give this movie my absolute highest recommendation.  Tom Hanks is excellent and the story is terrific.  Watch and see how one man's courage and will to live conquer all obstacles.",1112140800,4,3198,4.524390243902439

1283767,5,B00003CXRO,"There are numerous films that portray the theme of love through various subjects. I had watched 'Cast Away' recently, which gave me a chance to think about what love is in reality, not as in a fiction. This film portrays the message of what true love is by adopting airplane crash as its subject.

This film overshows a lot of moments where Tom Hanks overcomes tough situations for survival after being isolated in an island. For instance, he learns to make fire from bare woods and leaves that eventually enabled him to sleep at night for 4 years. His adventure scenes however, are not simply designed for attracting audience only. The camera captures the photo of Tom's wife from time to time especially when he goes to bed, which indirectly implies how Tom could potentially go through fighting against a nature. I believe that such a desparate faith for a single lover would have a profound impact on young couples these days, where 'love for a single person'seems to be falling apart.

I would like to recommend this film to couples around me who are facing hard time with their lover. By realizing how important it is to be faithful at the right time when couples are together, they would successfully handle their problems for sure.

1283770,4,B00003CXRO,"While I will agree with many other reviewers:

1. This is an excellent performance by Tom Hanks
2. The story and performance transcend the need for constant dialog
3. This is a gripping tale of survival

I also think such observations miss the point of the film entirely.

While being literally stranded on an island is ostensibly the main plot of the film, the real intent is to use this as an allegory or metaphor for the immense changes that life often brings.

Told in three acts, Cast Away is the story of Chuck Noland (Hanks) a man entirely in control of his life (waiting on marriage, dating the right girl, good career, friends, etc.) when he is unexpectedly stranded. After years of waiting he is rescued by an angel's wings in the form a port-a-john wall. When he returns he finds everything he knew has changed.

How many of us have undergone similar transitions in life? Times when we seem to plateau or enter a dark tunnel and wonder if we will ever come out at the end. And when we do finally emerge we find we have entered a world unlike the one we left. This is the real story of Cast Away.

Symbolism is used frequently. His girlfriend on the island is merely a locket picture. The pocket watch he checks so carefully has stopped. Other images or devices are repeated or used for effect (angel wings, fire, Wilson, Chuck's physical changes).

Perhaps I give the story too much credit, but I think if you watch it again (or for the first time), you might see a different film than you were expecting. And perhaps you can find some parrallel to a time in your life when you have been Cast Away, only to return to a new and different world.

What more can you ask from a Tom Hanks movie?",1105574400,6,1701,4.3949044585987265
1283867,5,B00003CXRO,"I can't offer enough superlatives as to how good this film is.  This collaboration between director Robert Zemeckis and actor Tom Hanks is, in my mind, virtually flawless and a totally compelling viewing experience.  Those naysayers who would dismiss this film should recognize what a challenge this film is.  Zemeckis(and Hanks) are asking us to follow a story that asks us to follow the transformation of a man whose whole life revolves around punctuality and now finds himself with all the time in the world.  Tom Hanks gives probably his most challenging performance to date.  The scenes on the island where Hanks has few props to work with, if you count ""Wilson"" the volleyball, are just masterful.  Hanks uses his consummate skills as an actor to pull us in and never lets go.  Though this film was a box office success it received something of a lukewarm critical response.  I would hope that in years to come when the careers of Hanks(and Zemeckis) are evaluated that ""Cast Away"" is recognized for the great film that it is.",1101686400,2,1032,4.790960451977401
1283868,3,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt are very good. If this movie had eliminated some of the commercialism and either stranded both of them or just Hanks without a previous relationship with Hunt it would have been better I think. As it is FedEx was overly thrown in our face and it leaves a bad taste in our mouth when Hunt and Hanks don't get back together at the end of the movie. So along with being stranded on an island for years, poor Hanks has no assurances about his life or a relationship in the end. If you like depressing endings this may appeal to you. There is only a faint hint of a possible chance at a relationship with the sculptor that drew the wings on a package he found on the island. I regret I don't feel like viewing it again like I do towards other castaway movies. This would have been a great movie for Hanks if they had just shown a little part of him working for FedEx, then stranded him on the island after the plane crash. Then use some interesting things on the island perhaps even a native like in Robinson Crusoe, and definitely skip the bit with the volleyball. Look how well the series ""Lost"" is doing because of the great acting and the suspense of what is on the island. I have all of Tom Hanks movies except this one.

1283869,4,B00003CXRO,Cast Away is a ok movie. Its about a guy who works for Fed-Ex and the airplane he is on crashes and he survies and lives on a island for 3 years by himself. The guy gets weird and talks to a volyball that has blood on it. Unless you like movies about people who live on islands alone don't watch Cast Away.,1097884800,2,306,3.873015873015873
1283870,3,B00003CXRO,"This started out to be a good, regular movie -- and Tom Hanks was a handsome administrator of a nationally known company.  The scene in Russia was fabulous with his proving his point that it takes much too long to deliver packages long distance, or here in America.  He's an excellent actor, but as the movie progressed he regressed into a savage from a jungle.  Not just the ultimate survivor on an isolated island somewhere no one else ever comes near.

I kept wanting some of the Gilligan's Island silliness to intervene with his deterioration mentally.  ""Wilson"" was the substitute for a real companion, yet only a volleyball gone astray.

When I saw it was FedEx featured in this film, it delighted me as several weeks ago I wrote to the owner of a local radio station that maybe he'd never heard of FedEx.  It was taking too long to get a part for the transmitter for his station which aired ""Music Of Your Life"" network.  A few months previously, the same part was needed after a storm struck the antenna and it was 2 months or more before the network was back on local airwaves.  This time, the part apparently was never ordered.  So my reference to FedEx was not impressive to him as he owns a large sports equipment company in Nashville.  No FedEx for him!

The preview to becoming a castaway was entertainment par excellence.  Afterward, however, his character becomes a mental case and it was not easy to watch.  Surely no place could be that isolated so as not to even have birds or animals, only a small type of fish and a scorpion which he ate -- showing he is the ultimate survivor.

If he'd been stranded in Iceland or the North Pole, the story might have been believable, but on a beautiful island in the middle of nowhere was just too much.

Thank goodness, he switched to playing character actors after that ordeal which suits him better anyway, for he is a good actor.  The movie itself was not much and very little dialogue which made it almost like watching a silent movie from the olden days with the exceptions of his grunts and guttural 'help's.",1096156800,,2071,4.524193548387097
1283871,4,B00003CXRO,"""Cast Away"" reunites once again the awarded team Zemeckis / Hanks, and once again they made a good film. There are several remarkable aspects in ""Cast Away"": overall the cinematography is excellent, the photography is quite realistic and Tom Hank's characterization is also great.

 Robert Zemeckis and William Broyles (screenwriter) showed a lot of creativity by including the lovable character ""Wilson"", definitely a character to remember. ""Cast Away"" sometimes feels and looks so realistic that you really feel trapped in a lonely island with Tom Hanks. You will suffer along Chuck Noland (Hanks) loneliness and desperation.

 Technically ""Cast Away"" is almost flawless, like all the movies directed by Robert Zemeckis, and overall the story is very good and realistic. However the movie also has weak spots: Helen Hunt is misused in a very lackluster role to Helen's standards. The first half hour of the movie elapses with few highlights, and the last half hour is kinda disappointing.

 At the end of the day, ""Cast Away"" is a worthy movie. Specially for Tom Hanks' fans or Robert Zemeckis' fans.",1091750400,,1102,5.162921348314606

1283873,5,B00003CXRO,"This movie is very touching, and it's been hard for me to watch it again.  Why you ask, because I use to date a girl back in 1996 when she lived here in Fitzgerald, GA.  Her name is Kelly aswell.  We dated briefly, but that all ending when her dad had to move to Houston, TX because of his job being transfered from the railcart co. here in Fitzgerld, GA, to Houston, TX.  Me and her lost contact with each other until 2002, when I was able to find where she was and to finally get in touch with her again.  She came back to Fitzgerald and We hugged each other for a long while.  She stayed for a day or so here in town with another family member of her's, then they left to go back to Houston, TX.  Sadly she started dating someone there in January of 2003.  She told me that she did not think she could take having a long distance relationship, which that does make since.  She did however came back later that year, but it was different.  She saw it as a Friendly visit instead. But we still email each other everynow and then.
I know you could care less about my experience compared to this movie, but anyway Tom Hanks again brings in a great performance in ""CastAway"", just like he did in ""Saving Private Ryan"".  The only thing I dislike about this movie is that he sounds like he is apologizes for not coming back to Kelly(Helen Hunt).  It's not his fault the plane went down and he got stranded on an island, and Kelly(Helen Hunt) should have held out longer to see if he would indid be found.  Which he is found and returns to Texas, and to his job as a Fed-Ex worker.  But Kelly(Helen Hunt) is now remarried and has a daughter.  But the movie does end on a positive note.

The sustaining forces of this movie were Wilson, the infamous volleyball, and the ""undelivered package,"" which really means nothing held it together.

Tom Hanks gave a wonderful performance, as well as Helen Hunt even though she only takes up about 30 minutes of screen time.  The movie, mostly was almpost without sound.  It was really different and I though that was really bold of Zemeckis.

Well, consider this: many people have let themselves forget that movies used to be more than ""naked-people-in-car-chases""; they used to teach you something, make you realize something you already knew, or rekindle the hope we have in humanity. Sadly, it seems as though this movie was watched by those who have forgotten these things (and then wrote a review;) Yes, this is not a ""fun, feel good"" type of film,  yet these are often the most important films of all; one feels as though they are actually undergoing the ordeal with Chuck Noland (Hanks), feeling the despair, loneliness and fear right there along side him; but thanks to some seriously underrated writing, we also feel his sense of renewal at the end, when he realizes that nothing happens by accident; this element of spirituality, though never directly addressed in the film is what gives it the ability to transcend the screen and reach out to all who have ever felt profound loss and solitude.  Sometimes the lessons we learn in life don't come in prettily wrapped packages; watching this movie (and learning the lessons it has to offer) may not always be a comfortable, felicitous experience, but definitely worth every minute.",1082073600,12,1306,4.958904109589041

1284018,4,B00003CXRO,"I can't count the exact number of days that I sat here thinking, ""Why would any one mail a keyboard to William Golding, the master of all Cast Away type novels, the author of Lord of the Flies and Pincher Martin?"". Finally I decided to open the package and start it up. ""Prints out on index cards"", the box states, ""Made in China"". The grandpappy of all Cast Away scenarios was Gulliver's Travels, but the similarity ends shortly in the modern Cast Away. Kon Tiki was Thor Heyerdahl's search to find the specific Pacific origins of Polynesian culture. There are no Polynesians in Cast Away, but there is a raft. Blue Lagoon was a film similar to this but set in the 1800's, and the characters had someone to talk to. Gilligan's Island involved a group of Cast Away types and was successful for years, yet too amusing to believe, except for Thurston Howell the Third. In Golding's novel Lord of the Flies, a group of children grows up lost on an island, and become very primitive before mankind finds them. Pincher Martin is the movie and novel of Golding's that Cast Away resembles most. In fact Cast Away could have been a technicolor remake of that saga, but maybe Tom Hanks couldn't do the British accent required for Christopher Hadley Martin, lost sailor, in the north Atlantic, in World War Two. There are no fancy conscience wrenching flash backs in Cast Away, as in Pincher Martin, but the original plane crash should not be missed by those who love the sense that the movie screen is going to swallow you up and destroy you along with the movie's hero. The one saving grace of Cast Away not being a Golding remake is that the film states the problem of being stranded alone in the beautiful south Pacific with a low budget approach that lets the horror of Edgar Allen Poe lean into the front row and say, ""You, dear audience, have room now, without all the intellectual posturing of a brain bending novel in front of you, to personally join our hapless victim of modern disaster and the failure of proficiency in transit, an airplane crash."" Here you are, seeing what countless short stories and novels have used as a trite easy plot, but Cast Away isn't going to preach to you. This film is also here to say, ""Even you can afford to learn what this extreme loser is learning, survive, and like it, because what you don't see here is the hell that awaits the ultimate loser, the wicked and the damned."" Quote within a quote? Sure why not? There's no one else out here to talk to. Except some trees, a lost keyboard, a volleyball, myself, deep inside, where I had better keep me before I really go nuts and admit to telepathic powers that could signal travelling cannibals to the island, my kingdom, our kingdom, the land of myself, and Gulliver, and Gilligan, but he's not here, just some old spooks, and mister flashlight, and Wilson Volleyball. Don't mind the spooks, you might sense but don't see here either. There's an old pirate, a lost balloonist, a couple of navy deserters, a native in a grass skirt, really old and just standing there watching me trying to escape. ""You'll escape"", they're saying, ""Don't photograph us. The after life contains a message out here. There is no escape ultimately. Just try to relax."" I wonder how they communicate those thoughts without laughing out loud. They might not even be talking to me. I had better grab my volleyball and surf raft and get back to what modern life calls civilisation. Now that's what I call escape. Let's all do this again, until we get it right.",1073865600,,3521,4.59047619047619

1284020,3,B00003CXRO,"Having just watched this movie for the first time, I have to admit that it was more entertaining than I had been led to believe.  It is, of course, not a unique theme (what is nowadays?) in that it the story of a modern, successful corporate cog who is suddenly and unexpectedly forced to deal with a situation that requires him to learn anew how to survive.  During the course of which, he naturally is forced to reassess his own worldview as he no longer exists in an environment over which he has control.  I found the symbolism in this movie to be quite significant and relevant.  But overall the movie was not as profound and authentic as it could have been.  In fact, even with my limited knowledge of the subject, it is quite clear that the island could not have sustained any human life over the course of four years.  Interestingly enough, although license was taken in terms of the feasability of Chuch's survival on an isolated ecosystem, the producers had no problem in casting him as the employee of an actual courier company.  We could well have gotten the point of this movie had they devised a superficial company, which makes the movie in essence a three hour commercial.

Intelligent, well educated [not necessarily formally], honorable individuals are so much more interesting than nerds...and therefore more gratifying and rewarding to identify with. The challenges on the island would tax even a sagacious survivalist. 2]the Wilson thing was misplaced, even for a nerd...the island undoubtedly had insect life, therefore bird life. An orphaned baby bird out of the nest, for instance, would have offered the magic and mystery of a pure personality to care and provide for, which, if lost at sea, would have been truly tragic...albeit much more difficult to film.
Minor complaints...1]Hitting the water at ~250 miles an hour would have thrown Chuck forward, not back...he should have braced himself against something for impact. 2]The minutia of survival could have been educating and fascinating. 3]Trying to knock out an endodontically ravaged upper molar with the given vector would have broken the tooth off at the gumline...and left the offending roots intact. 4]Most importantly, the last time we see the Helen Hunt character should have been the scene at the airport...the subsequent scenes were manipulative, maudlin, and over played. I wish we had spent more time with the ""civilized"" Chuck...with even less dialogue...solitude IS civilizing.
Compliments...Silvestri's score is magnificent and well placed...as good as it gets...also the cinematography at sea.

It was nice and all that (slightly interesting), yet I felt that after walking away from it, there had been too many missed opportunities which might have lifted the feature above a mere ordinary level.
Tom Hanks gave a fine performance, though his character seldom appeared realistic to me (that's just me). My main concern would be the forced ending. It was, in my opinion, not worked out fully. This had nothing to do with Hanks or Hunt, to be sure.
Still, Cast Away looks good and realistic (except for the computer-made fish). I thought the crash of the plane worthy of special mention. But after Hanks got off the island, things went 'somewhat wrong'.

His fast-paced lifestyle is rudely interrupted by a plane crash, leaving him stranded on an island with only his wits, a pair of ice skates, and a marraige dissolution.  I found this middle section to be intriguing because it is a kind of ""silent movie:""  visual pictures are painted and we don't need dialogue or a cheesy, sappy score to ruin it.  I think this is the best attribute of the movie:  Silvestri wrote only a 10-minute score which is only heard as Chuck escapes the island.  As Chuck is found and he rediscovers himself, we are treated with fascinating twists.  First, he DOES NOT win the girl back, which is typical of most Hollywood nonsense.

Robert Zemekis could not have chosen a better actor than Tom Hanks for this roll he delivers a great performance and for alot of the film is acting in soliloquy which shows how good a performance he really gives on this film. Castaway is a story of hope in dispair and is not pretentious to this kind of desert island film, it's a good film that you should see at least twice.",1058745600,,760,4.212328767123288
1284219,4,B00003CXRO,"I suppose it's theoretically possible to make an unpopular movie starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt. Maybe A Chorus Line 2: Dancin' With Barney, or The Real Life Adventures of Al Gore. But it wouldn't be easy. Hanks' gift for connecting with audiences, coupled with Hunt's effortless likeability, make Cast Away virtually a sure thing from the start.
Which is not to say that it's a great movie. The basic plot has been done for centuries, in every flavor from Robinson Crusoe to The Black Stallion to Gilligan's Island. In this case, a time-obsessed FedEx Manager (Hanks) finds himself with nothing but endless empty days and solitude when a plane crash leaves him stranded on a tiny Pacific island. But Hanks elevates this tired premise to a compelling human story that ultimately justifies the big budget and upstages some spectacular effects. (That's just about as close as I want to get to a real commercial jet crash, thanks very much.) A measure of the star's discipline and dedication to the project is the fact that he lost fifty pounds between the shooting of the initial scenes and the later ones - the better to convey the effects of four years' survival on thin provender.
The most remarkable thing about this film is what's left out - especially if you compare it to something like Six Days Seven Nights. There are no ruthless pirates here, no sexual tension, no snakes finding their way into anyone's underwear. There's no restless hopping between Hanks on the island and the loved ones left behind. Banking everything on the skill and popularity of his star, director Zemeckis leaves him alone on the screen for 75 straight minutes. (Well, not entirely alone: his companion through most of his time on the island is a volleyball, washed up from the wreckage of the plane, that he decorates with a face and hair, and dubs ""Wilson."") When all is said and done, you don't miss all those action-adventure fripperies for even a minute. It's a tribute to Hanks that he can make an effective co-star out of playground equipment.
A lot of movie reviews say things like ""this film isn't for everyone, but...."" Well, Cast Away pretty much is for everyone. Except for the very young children who would be frightened by the plane crash and one or two slightly gruesome scenes, just about everybody can enjoy this film. In a way, that's a criticism - it's bland enough for every palate - but it's still well worth the seeing.",1054080000,6,2427,4.753554502369668
1284378,4,B00003CXRO,"This movie hammers home the idea, to me at least, that Tom Hanks deserves the Oscar. His acting ability amazes me.
This film harkens back to one of Tom's older films Joe Versus the Volcano, as the main character ends up on a deserted island. In this film, it's because of a plane crash in the pacific. The similarities between Cast Away and JVTV were numerous, with lots of bits of symbolism all through the film.
Chuck Noland (Hanks) is a Fed-Ex employee who is obsessed with time. Everything has to be done on time (the Fed-Ex motto). When things go wrong in the biz, they call him in. When he gets called away right before Christmas, he figures it's just a short trip. A few hours later, he's in the drink.
Trying to survive on the island only one concern. The other is keeping his sanity, which is apparently in short supply. Hanks delivers one of the best performances of his career in this film, which hardly got a second glance by critics.
While there are a few special effects in the film (the plane crash), the film is mostly centered on Hanks character and follows him while he tries to make some resemblence of a life on the island. Where's Gilligan, the Skipper and the professor when you need them?
Any Hanks fan should own this one. This is the one he got robbed of the Oscar on. You can repeat this mantra everytime you watch it. It's a slow constant flow-of-a-film, and is very dramatic and wonderful.  I would have liked more special features, so I didn't give it 5 stars.",1053561600,,1489,4.434306569343065
1284379,5,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away is just an amazing cinematic achievement.  You don't just watch this movie; you really have to devote an entire night to it; it's just that powerful and moving.  At almost two and a half hours in length, it is uncommonly long in and of itself (but it does not feel long to the enthralled viewer); figure in all of the incredible special features included in the 2-disc special edition, and you are looking at a whole night's worth of rich entertainment.  Cast Away has just about everything you could want in a movie: romance, adventure, action, heartbreak, suspense, mystery, nature at its most ugly and most beautiful, you name it; most importantly, it manages, after several cathartic moments, to leave one with a sense of hope and a strange kind of joy.  Tom Hanks takes us on an emotional roller coaster ride, and he deserves a tremendous amount of credit for making this film work as perfectly as it does.  There really isn't a lot of dialogue during the time on the island; long drawn-out moments focus on Hanks' expression, body language, and emotion.  When he finds a friend to talk to in Wilson, he makes that character really come alive and become a very real character in the film.
Don't think that this is just another Robinson Crusoe remake.  Chuck Noland (Hanks) is an obsessive, deeply committed system engineer for FedEx.  Everything for him must be planned and executed according to the limits of time, and so he is truly a duck out of water when his plane goes down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and leaves him stranded all alone on a deserted island.  Time is meaningless for him here, but he has a picture of the woman he loves with him to help him go on living when it would be so easy to just give up.  He learns to survive on his own in the tropical environment, but not without much pain and battles with hopelessness.  When the situation threatens to overwhelm him, the character of Wilson comes along.  Wilson is a volleyball, but he has a face framed with Chuck's own blood and becomes the personification of the world of people he longs to return to.  After four years on the island, Wilson is a true companion whom Chuck talks to, argues with, but dearly loves as a very real friend.  The escape attempt from the island is very powerful, containing within itself more important truths and examples of the human spirit than I can name.  It is also where the first tears begin to well up in my eyes.  You might expect this type of film to end with a long-overdue rescue and return to a happy life, but in Cast Away, the real human drama is just getting started at this point.  Chuck's return home to his friends and the woman he loves is so much more than bittersweet; having seemingly lost everyone and everything he cared for four years earlier, his miraculous return becomes another tale of great loss.  This movie is a real tear-jerker; just when you think it's time to rejoice, you are met with more poignant heartbreak.  Hope never dies, though, and the writers do a tremendous job of subtly presenting that heart-warming message.
I love Wilson; he is such a great character that, volleyball or not, I think he should have been nominated for a best supporting actor award.  Amazingly, he really slipped into the movie by accident, yet much of this movie's power is conveyed through him.  The inclusion of a featurette on the life and death of Wilson on the second DVD is a testament to his importance to this story.  This second DVD is filled with an incredible selection of bonus features: features on the making of the film, its special effects, and a look at the beautiful and bonafide island paradise location of the filming; there is an interview of Tom Hanks by Charlie Rose, a survivalist documentary, and a movie-length commentary as well.  You can't ask more from a movie than Cast Away gives you, and you can't ask for more from a DVD than this two-disc special edition delivers.",1050364800,6,3938,4.586305278174037
1284380,5,B00003CXRO,"This is one of my top ten favorite movies. Of interesting note is the fact that at first I didn't like it. I hated it for a time. When I walked out of the theater I was like ""What was in the package"" and ""That was weak"". The first statement is a silly and unecessary question, the latter is just an outright lie, now. The one thing I took away from that first viewing was the unique plot device that was Wilson. My fascination with this came a while later. On a happenstance the MTV movie awards paired a clip with a snippet of Green Day's ""Castaway"". Now mentioning Green Day won't get you instant acceptance in my book, but it will get you a second chance. So, I watched it again, and again, and again. A certain premium movie channel was very helpful in that respect. In brief, it is enough to say that I fell in love with it. The relationship with Wilson is simply brilliant. In addition, there is something real about this movie. Tom doesn't end up making a palace of reeds or getting back with Helen Hunt once he returns. No, he survives using his senses and items from the downed plane. This movie is a great lesson in overcoming functional fixedness! But another pivotal thing is the fact that he does not renew his relationship once he returns. Instead of idealizing the situation and having him have a fairy-tale reunion, he must deal with the very real fact that she has moved on. A thoroughly realistic storyline and a unique view into the human psyche under immense stress make this a truely original and moving movie.",1049241600,,1531,4.432624113475177
1284381,5,B00003CXRO,"It is a beautifully photographed story, drawing out the unforgiving beauty of the island in all its moods. The photography also draws the viewer into the story by including items in the frame that the viewer is allowed to discover. Sometimes we see them before Chuck (such as the nighttime passing ship on the horizon), sometimes we see things at the same moment as Chuck. One striking scene is when Chuck first ascends to the top of the island and through the panoramic scene we share his discovery that he is alone and there is no other land on the horizon. Now that I have seen the extra features unavailable in the theater, I have an even greater appreciation for how the cinematographer achieved this. It is clear from the extra feature that there actually was another island quite close by, but the cinematographer was able to do a very wide angle shot from the top of the mountain giving the feeling of absolute isolation and still hide the fact that in reality there was another island right behind the actor.
It is a terrific acting job by Tom Hanks. He carries a tremendous load in this movie. For nearly two hours he is the only person in the movie. His demonstration of the many stages his character experiences is convincing. He portrays manic devotion to the job, fear, frustration, depression, elation, disappointment, resignation and contented hope.
The score and audio are wonderfully understated. During the whole island inhabitation there is no music. All one hears is the quiet sounds of the desert island. We finally hear some quiet but stirring music as Hanks escapes the island, and it is so expressive of the relief and freedom he must be feeling because we are experiencing it with him.
It is a well written story of human transformation. At the beginning of the story we meet Chuck, the Fed Ex legend, devoted to his job and the clock. Over two hours (or several years) later, we leave Chuck knowing a completely different man who has had his life and priorities totally rearranged. Some of this is forced on him by his experience. But his hopefulness at the end is a response of his own choice. The viewers experienced the process with him, and we leave the story with our own opportunities for reflection and hope.
To my memory, this movie didn't win very many major awards. I know Hanks received the Golden Globe for his acting, but I think that's it. I believe the film deserved more. I suppose it is either a tribute to the competition that year, or a shame on judges who prefer more standard Hollywood fare.",1049068800,,2539,4.657015590200445
1284382,2,B00003CXRO,"Unless there's some significance to Chuck Noland being stranded for 4 years, why was it necessary to display the graphic stating the amount of time that passed?  Whether it's 2 years, 4 years or 10 years, you can tell by looking at the character that a lengthy period has elapsed.
Actually, considering how our society needs it's information simplified and spoon-fed, I should be happy it wasn't worse.  There could have been an off screen narrator.
""Now children, Mr. Noland has been on the island a LOOOOOOONG time and has grown very skinny.""

1284383,5,B00003CXRO,"When I first saw this movie in theatres I was somewhat surprised at the somewhat sobering ending, but then quickly realized this may have been the only appropriate ending to this story of one man's struggle with nature and on another level his own inner struggles which could easily be seen as a metaphor for all our lives and other psychobabble points.  (I know, blah, blah, blah.)
Without getting too deep into analyzing this film and ruining it for anyone who hasn't seen it (are they actually out there?) I found this movie interesting, entertaining and actually educational.  Whoa!  Did I just say educational?  Yep, I did.  If you ever wondered what it would be like to truly ""get away from society"" for awhile, then watch this film! I think this may have been fairly realistic and as reality usually goes, this film too has a sobering with a somewhat philosophical ending.
This film is almost more of a documentary (although I believe it is fictional) than entertainment.  If you want a typical ""feel good"" Hollywood movie, this may not fit the bill.  This may be the reason why some do not care for this atypical but interesting film.  There is a lot to be learned here from Tom's portrayal of one mans trials and tribulations in order to just survive.
""No man is an island"".  Right?  Well I doubt this famous quote had anything to do with one man getting stranded on an island, rather it has to do with the fact it takes many people to accomplish most tasks, not just one person.  This is where this dvd excels.  The discs extras nearly show the viewer how the entire film was made.  How each of the films departments and the people made their contributions.  Particular attention was paid to pre-production and scouting for the perfect island backdrop.  Lots of input from the actor, director, writer and others really gives the viewer a feel for what goes on behind and before the camera starts shooting.
Pros:
--Gives the viewer a fairly realistic feel for being stranded alone
--Not your typical, predictable Hollywood film
--Somewhat educational..(egads!)
--Lots of behind the scenes shots, comments and movie production notes on dvd
Cons:
--NOT your typical ""feel good"" movie experience

1284386,5,B00003CXRO,"Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a modern day Robinson Crusoe.  It's far from it!  Survival is only a small part of the story of Chuck Noland, who ends up on a deserted island in the Pacific after a plane crash.  There's a great deal of things that make this movie a success.  Notably, there are lots of special effects and some very clever filming and computer work.  As a result, you really feel as if you are on the spot - on the plane as it goes down, on the raft as it bobs in the waves, on the island alone.  It's the realism that's led to the PG-13 rating, and not offensive content.  Admittedly there are a few items of content that are morally questionable, such as a few incidents of blasphemy, a crude sexual joke, and the contemplation of suicide.  Initially Chuck and Kelly live together while unmarried, and though-out his stay on the island there's a real absence of religious faith as fatalism replaces providence (while burying a crash victim, Chuck concludes an ""empty"" ceremony with the words ""So.  That's it."")  But on the whole this movie is morally inoffensive, and its PG-13 rating is mainly due to frightening scenes, such as the airplane crash and later a floating dead body, and several injuries including the scraping of skin on coral, a splinter in his hand, and the removal of a tooth.  But even these scenes are more frightening because of the emotional sense of pain than graphic images.  Clever manipulation of sights and sounds are used to create a real sense of fear and suspense, and even the simple dropping of coconuts on the sand becomes frightening. Hitchcock would have been proud.
But even more than the special effects, it is especially the emotional conclusion combined with some stellar acting that made this movie. The survival story is framed by the story of Chuck's life in America.  As a result, the movie is like a play with three Acts.  Act 1 introduces us to Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx systems engineer whose professional life is ruled by the clock.  ""We live and we die by time.  Let us not commit the sin of turning our back on time.""  His personal life, including his relationship with girlfriend Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) is dominated by time, and it is exactly for this reason that Chuck ends up on the doomed plane which crashes into the Pacific in a storm.
Acts 2 shows Chuck cast away on the island.  The clock, as it were, has stopped.  His survival experiences were based on the research and actual experiences of the screenwriter, and are depicted with a great deal of realism (Hanks made his contribution by losing a lot of weight and growing a delightful beard).  The island is no utopian tropical paradise, and consequently Chuck doesn't succeed with everything right away.  As he seeks to obtain the basic elements needed for human survival - food, water, shelter, fire, and companionship - there are memorable moments of triumph and tragedy, including his frustrations in getting coconut milk, his exuberance in starting a fire, and his primitive dentistry skills.  There is little dialogue, but a few floating FedEx packages supply him with ""Wilson"" the volleyball, who becomes his companion.  It's somewhat corny, but Wilson becomes a device for Chuck to express his thoughts and hold imaginary conversations.  Time has stopped on the timepiece Kelly gave him, but it is her photo on the clock that inspires Chuck to stay alive.
Act 3 brings Chuck back to civilization after some five years of survival on the island.  His Rip Van Winkel type return from the dead in my mind is the highlight of the movie, and results in emotional and moral dilemmas of tremendous power.  As his colleague says: ""Tomorrow we're going to bring you back to life.""  But coming back to life isn't so easy when you return to a world after five years where time hasn't stopped.  If surviving as a castaway on an island was difficult, Chuck discovers that it's just as difficult to be alive in the changed world to which he has returned.  Back at home, he's still a castaway.  Just as on the island, where ""I stayed alive.  I kept breathing"", so now he must keep breathing, waiting to see what the tide will bring.  A magnificent story-line combined with some tremendous acting from both Hanks and Hunt results in a powerful sense of loss.  I was grateful that the story didn't degenerate into a feel-good type ending with an immoral tryst, but actually suggested faithfulness to the institution of marriage (a departure from Chuck and Kelly's initial live-in relationship).  The ending is tough, but realistic, emotional, and powerful, and I was left thinking about it for a long long time.  There is a note of hope in the end, but it is not shoved down your throat, with Chuck left at the cross-roads of decision: ""Where are you headed?  Well, I was just about to figure that out.""  If there is a criticism, it would perhaps be that we don't get to spend as much time with the changed Chuck in Act 3 as we would like -  he has a new perspective on life, and we would learn something if we saw this new perspective put into practice.  But for viewers whose lives are also governed by the clock, what we do see is already enough to motivate us to spend our few years on earth under the clock wisely.",1041897600,2,5261,4.622174381054898

Roger Ebert complains in his review that Zemekis and company revealed too much of the plot in the trailer for ""Cast Away."" I concur with Ebert, although I may have come by my prior knowledge by reading reviews or talking to people who saw the movie.
The ending was a good idea with our protagonist meeting the woman who sent the FedEx package at the beginning of the movie (classic envelope pattern). But it wasn't filmed well (with Hanks standing in the middle of a dusty Texas intersection, pondering which direction to take next).

1284530,3,B00003CXRO,"AMERICAN SWEETHEARTS was directed by Joe Roth (Angels In The Outfield, Streets Of Gold) and co-written by one of the stars themselves - Billy Crystal (Monster, Inc., When Harry Met Sally, Analyze This). For me it was a great treat watching Billy. Billy has this sarcastic criticism about the Entertainment Industry - and life overall - that is so close to things I have said about people, places and things that I often wonder if he is following me recording my thoughts! He is hysterical!
Now - as far as the film goes....it has a pretty big cast - John Cussack (16 Candles, Say Anything, The Grifters) and Cathrine Zeta Jones (The Mask Of Zorro, the new Chicago, The Haunting) do a great job as the `Hollywood Couple' gone wrong. Except for the public eye and the personalities on camera - off camera they are `oil and water'. Cathrine character is support by the hysterically funny and often underrated Hank Azaria (The Birdcage, Godzilla, Anastasia) as her Cuban lover. He is a scene-stealer! Here's another talent that needs o be given a chance. Through it all, Billy Crystal's character, the publicist (who also has a sidekick - cleverly and meekly played by Seth Green (all three Austin Powers films)) needs the help of Cathrines'sister played by (with an impressively timid performance) of Julia Roberts (Pretty Women, Steele Magnolias, Erin Brochovich). Quite a cast, right?
Needless to say, enter the eccentric performance of the crazy director (of Catherine's and John's newest film the general public has been dying to see); Christopher Walkin (Brainstorm, The Dead Zone, Mouse Hunt) There is comedy, slapstick, farce and more. A good story and silly premise make for a very entertaining movie for all!
Again, I mention that Billy Crystal has some of the best lines - like - `...oh look, there's the buffet..."" and many many, more! Stanley Tucci (A Mid Summer Nights Dream, The Pelican Brief, Road To Perdition) gives a fantastic performance as the typical Hollywood Producer gone panicked.
The DVD extras include the usual trailer and previews and there is also a special section with deleted scenes where there is a limited on camera commentary with director Jo Roth.

Sadly, by the time he gets back to the real world, the story sinks into a mire of sap that will threaten the loss of your ocular mobility from over rolling of the eyes.

1284532,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away is the story of Chuck (Tom Hanks), a FedEx delivery worker who finds himself stranded on a desert island after his plane goes down.  On each end of the movie is the story of his life back in the ""real world""; however, that story is somewhat undeveloped and underemphasized.  Before the crash he had just proposed to his fiance, and upon his return he finds that she is married with children (and on a side note, either time moved faster on the mainland or else his loving fiance was married and pregnant in less than a year after his disappearance).  I felt that subplot should have either been left alone or else dealt with in a more elaborate way; the ending left the movie feeling incomplete.
However, the heart of the movie involves Chuck's time on the island, and it is simply Hanks at his best.  Chuck is alone, trying to survive; every little task could mean the difference between life and death.  For Hanks, this means he must display the gamut of emotions about seemingly trivial matters with no other actors to help with the illusion.  I know of no other actor that could have me to the point of tears when a volleyball starts to float away from him.  No offense to Russel Crowe, but how he won Best Actor for playing a stoic, monosyllabic gladiator over this performance is one of life's great mysteries.

1284625,5,B00003CXRO,"I did not want to see this movie. Even though it stars Tom Hanks, quite frankly, it sounded boring as all get-out. And maybe it could have been, with any other actor.
Who else but Tom Hanks can create and sustain a deep and personal relationship with a volleyball upon which he has drawn a face? Who else but Tom Hanks can nearly drown on a crude hand-built raft in high waves, looking for that same volleyball, calling its name and sobbing uncontrollably? Who else but Tom Hanks can have you sobbing with him?
I won't review the plot here, since so many other reviewers have done so--and done it well. What I want to concentrate upon is Hanks' truly extraordinary acting ability. As we watch him change from cocky Fed-Ex manager extraordinaire to severely shaken plane crash survivor, to a marooned castaway on a desert island, we are drawn to him simply by the look on his face. Hanks moves from fear to frustration to anger to illness to vulnerability to joy to fear again...all the human emotions, conveyed seemingly effortlessly from a set that we know provided endless hardships for cast and crew.
There are innumberable scenes that are unforgettable for the sheer strength of his acting: the above-mentioned grief over Wilson the volleyball is one; the tooth-pulling scene is another; his joy over catching a fish...there are just no words to accurately convey how brilliant this film really is.

Tom Hanks plays Chuck Nolan, a 40-year-old FedEx employee who is stranded on a desert island after a plane crash. This means that Tom Hanks basically IS 2/3 of Cast Away, acting all by himself with very little dialogue. This movie captivated me, watching how ""Chuck"" went from a workaholic average American to a Pacific islander over a period of several years psychologicaly AND phyiscally. Cast Away is a feircely imaginative movie, completly gripping and beautiful.",1026864000,,567,5.042553191489362
1284627,5,B00003CXRO,"The moneymen must have been biting their fingernails over this one.  They know Tom Hanks can carry a movie, but can Tom Hanks BE the movie? I'd say the answer is ""yes,"" in a quiet sort of way.
Chuck Noland (TH) is a fast-talking, time-obsessed workaholic with just enough charm to keep him from being totally obnoxious.  He has a big job, probably as an industrial engineer in time management for FedEx, which is ironically omnipresent throughout the movie.  Chuck barely has time to court the lovely Helen Hunt (her talents totally wasted in this vapid role).  He exchanges Christmas presents with her in the car at the airport before he takes off on his fateful voyage.
The plane crashes into the sea near an atoll/island.  The crash is frighteningly horrific and terrifying.  All hands are lost except Chuck who is thrown free of the wreckage and driving propellers, and he struggles onto shore.  Up until this time, the movie is full of movement, sound, voices and has a rather brittle frenetic feel.  Now all is silence.  Chuck slowly gets his bearings and we are shown scenes of him trying to cope with his new situation.  FedEx cargo has washed ashore with him, and he opens boxes containing ice skates, a courtier gown and a volley ball that he names ""Wilson"" after its maker.  He is clumsy and has accidents, but we cannot help but admire his perseverance.  After grueling attempts, he finally gets a fire started and dances around it in pure Tarzan style congratulating himself to the heavens above.  A pause---and it is four years later.  The audience gasps ""Four years!""  The physical changes in Chuck are astounding.  From an open-faced, slightly pudgy all-American boy, he has been transformed into a gaunt, sinewy, bearded predator with wary shifting eyes.
With great bravery he opts to try and find civilization rather than either suicide or living out his days alone.  He painstakingly builds a raft and turns his back on the only safety he has known for four years.  After great suffering and privitation, he is rescued and flung back into civilization.
He reunites with his now-married girlfriend who announces he ""is the love of her life.""  Does she realize the man standing before her is an entirely different person than the one who left her?  Maybe.  She goes unwillingly back to her family.  Chuck is clearly uncomfortable in almost all social situations and drives to the desolate west, stopping at a crossroads wondering what direction to take.
Tom Hanks is marvelous in his role. (It seems I forever say the same thing, because he is always ""marvelous in his role."")  The film could have cut out maybe twenty minutes and not suffered a loss.  What is amazing is how he keeps your total attention and interest whether he is building a raft or talking to a volleyball.",1026691200,9,2793,4.782881002087683

Tom Hanks plays a character who works for Fed Ex. One night he has to go on an airplane to deliver packages...and it crashes. Luckily, Tom Hanks survives the crash and ends up on a deserted island, where he has to learn to fend for himself. Some of the Fed Ex packages arrive on the shore, and Tom uses what is inside to help him survive. With no one but himself, and Wilson, a volleyball with a hand imprint on it, Tom's character learns that in life you never take things for granted, and live each day with hope, because each new day brings new possibilities. The ending was a little sad, but it made sense and worked out. The film was a little long, but to fit all that into it, it had to be. Cast Away was certainly a fine film for everyone to enjoy.",1026604800,,909,4.112359550561798
1284629,4,B00003CXRO,"I don't know.  Definitely see the film, but this is really another character study.  Tom Hanks just happens to be stranded on a tropical island.  It's not about being stranded on a tropical island but about Tom Hanks trying to prove what a great character actor he is.  The similar stories, movies, and T.V. shows that  I saw as a child (Robinson Crusoe, Gilligan's Island, pirate stuff, Billy Budd, Typee, war movies where guys get stranded, etc.) were as fun and exciting or more so.  I think that's because those shows were about the situation more than a person's feelings or emotional adaptation the situation.  The whole idea of the genre is to escape mentally to a tropical island, not escape from one.  We want the imagined fantasy of freedom, running around in our underwear with tropical beauties and eating coconuts, not reality.
 The ending of Cast Away was cinematic poetry.  People should think (but not too deeply) for a few seconds about what was going on in the last shot.  I wished the moviemakers had stretched for a little more richness and depth in the part of the movie that occurs after Tom Hank's was rescued, including the very end.  They didn't show any change in personality, attitudes, increase in depth of personality, religious awakening, etc.  People who have been in different but far less intense situations, like the Peace Corp, for example, have come back with much more significantly changed attitudes and values about life.  The change could even have been that he came back as a basket case.  It shows a shallowness in the moviemaker's understanding of people both in the Tom Hank's character and in audiences.  I did think Meg Ryan's reactions to Tom Hank's release were well done and authentic.  But this is a movie you watch to be entertained not to analyze!
 Tom Hank's is trying too hard to be taken seriously as a great character actor.  I think he's trying to compete with Dinero and Nicholson-- ""star"" character actor.
When we watch Cast Away, we're watching Tom Hanks, and America loves Tom Hanks.  But when we watch Deniro in movies like Mean Streets and Taxi, we're watching the character.  Everything Deniro does with the character fits in perfectly.  Robert Deniro never draws attention to himself in a movie.  He draws attention to the character he is playing.  The same can be said of the younger Robert Duvall.
 And sorry, I don't think I can judge female actors.  I sense that many of the great ones were before my time.  But I would put Vivian Leigh on any list of the best.  I am not moved by Merryl Streep.  I think she is more intellectual in preparation than say a Julia Roberts who can emote anything.  Meryl Streep is one who learns accents well, learns to do Irish step dancing, etc to prepare for roles, but can you imagine her trying to play some of the characters Julia Roberts has played?

Believe me, they did NOT have to do it.  All it does is distract and disrupt to make them MORE MONEY that they DON'T NEED.  I say: DON'T SEE IT ON PRINCIPLE.  This movie isn't good enough to be worth supporting a sell-out.

1284631,4,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hank's role in Cast Away is one of his finest performances perhaps due to the difficulty with which the role presents. Playing the role of Fed Ex employee Chuck Nolan, Hank's character gets marooned on a deserted island when his plane goes down. As some reviewers have noted, the scenario for the film might not have sounded that appealing: a man gets stranded on an island and has to learn to survive with no one there, with his only true friend being (yes) a volleyball named Wilson. But, alas, Tom Hanks is able to pull this off and the movie is one of the more enjoyable films from director Robert Zemeckis.

The real struggle for Chuck Nolan is his seemingly altered state of life: he goes from being someone very much akin to time and life because of his job and his fiance (played by Helen Hunt) to an individual isolated relying on survival, both physical and mental. He relies on everything he can to get back to the life he once led. The biggest epiphany that he experiences is that he can survive; he only comes to terms with this realization after several failed attempts on the island. Not only does he comprehend the importance of surviving each day, but he has a better understanding later of the significance of pushing forward despite obstacles and changes in life.

The special effects and cinematic strategies used in the film are spectacular and vivid. For instance, the airplane crash scene seems to be so powerfully realistic. The moments of turbulence are followed by the big crash scene into the waters, and the struggle to make it to safety ensues. There are instances of no dialogue, where we see Chuck learning about the island and how to do things like attempting to hunt and find food, but Tom Hanks is able to make these moments entertaining and important. For instance, the frustration of trying to open a coconut shell at the beginning is comical, as well as the attempts to start a fire, ending with his own rendition of ""Light My Fire.""

The message that I seemed to take away from the film was the idea of second chance. That is, if we were given a second chance at life, how would this play out in our lives. Chuck's biggest obstacle is that life has changed so much since his supposed ""death"" that he has a hard time tackling exactly what he should be doing, and he has a hard time putting everything together once he gets back.

Overall, this is an excellent film and works well. If there is one drawback it is that the film length is a bit too long (two and a half hours almost). This probably could have been cut down to two hours. The DVD edition has extras that are worth checking out as well.",1026259200,,2639,4.491666666666666

1284633,4,B00003CXRO,"The job that one has makes it likely that one will develop a personality that is a function of that job.  In Robert Zemeckis' CAST AWAY, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) plays a FedEx executive whose life revolves around the clock.  If a package is late for delivery, someone under his command will catch hell.  For him, time is a precious commodity, and can be measured by the units of the clock, not by the ticks of the heart.  This is his life, and he and his fiancee, played briefly by Helen Hunt, do not seem unhappy with that.  His life changes and not just because he is cut off from the world for five years as he is marooned on a tropical island after a plane crash.  Most critics who comment on the movie point out that CAST AWAY is really an allegory of man's struggle for survival in an inhospitable environment against long odds.  Now certainly there is that subtext, but if that is the major point of the film, then why bother to have the first part where he is time driven or the last part where he seeks to re-establish emotional roots that were uprooted years before?  I see a different message: people are a function of their environment, which shapes their behavior, their food, their entertainment, their relations, or even their self-image.  This shaping imprints itself strongly with time, and a change of environment does not result in an immediate change within. The body and the soul need time to 'catch up.'  For Chuck Noland, his years on the island served to whittle away his outer shell of a clock-based life.  Slowly, he learns to eat, to swim, to care for his teeth in a rhythm dictated by the stars overhead, not by the watch that he misses more than all else.  When he miraculously reappears in his former life, he has to reset his internal clock once again.  The scene in which he plays with a match in his hotel room, lighting it effortlessly, producing a flame that he could not on his island, point out that though he is now in a hotel room, his mind has not yet made the temporal leap from the island.  It may take years for him to readjust himself, as the concluding scene with the pretty girl with the truck indicates. But he might, and this lesson in the slow acceptance of how changes in life cause changes in behavior resonate more powerfully than merely pondering the survival techniques of the latest Robinson Crusoe.",1025395200,,2354,4.495305164319249
1284634,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away
The first thought I had after seeing this film was whether or not I fully understood all of what I had seen. Posing this question will undoubtedly offer no easy answers, which for a film like Cast Away is probably a good thing. Cast Away begins with Fed Ex Executive Chuck Nolan (Tom Hanks in another stellar performance) explaining to his employee's that quote ""We live by the clock"". It's Christmas Eve and Chuck is enjoying a good meal with family and friends when his beeper rings and he finds himself forced to go out on a quick job. He tells his beautiful girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt) that he will be home in time for new years celebrations. He promises. However a tragic plane crash into the ocean (which is very thrilling and realistic) changes all that. Now Chuck will no longer be living by the clock because he's now got all the time in the world. A trailer that gives away the entire movie ruined cast Away for many people. A spokes man for 20th Century Fox Entertainment said that Cast Away is movie about a man lost at sea and how he deals with coming home to world of change. Frankly I do not see it that way. I am a firm believer that people want to be surprised when they go to the movies. The only other quibble I have about the movie is the ending from which I think we the viewers are left with too many questions. Besides those problems I walked out of the theatre feeling really satisfied with what I had seen. The acting is top flight. The cinematography is excellent and the score is also a plus. One thing to mention to people is that there isn't allot of dialogue in the movie which may turn some people off. However, those people not too fussy may find this film truly riveting. For me it was a breathtaking experience.  Review: **** out of five",1024790400,,1783,4.354354354354355

The special effects are superior and convincing, especially the crash scene. All credit to Zemeckis for not launching into the crash too early on in the film, too.
In fact, it is fitting that this movie is so well-paced, since it is a movie about time - its effects, its value and its dangers. It is a theme which is often delicately weaved into the plot, but at other times shoved in the audience's face with little subtlety.

1284757,4,B00003CXRO,"Directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), Castaway is the story of Chuck Noland, a man who lives his life by the clock, doing his job as a courier, whose life is changed when a plane trip to see his family turns into a struggle for survival. Tom Hanks reunites with director Zemeckis after Forrest Gump and gives another amazing performance, alongside his co-star, Wilson, a vollyball that gets washed up in the wreckage from the plane crash. And this is where Hanks' brilliant performance shows, with the slowly building friendship that Chuck has with his vollyball buddy.
Zemeckis' direction is strong and well-handled when events are on the island; witness Chuck's discovery of the dead pilot, his attempts to start a fire, and a truly wincing moment where he does some DIY dentistry. The fact that Hanks can hold his own as the only guy on the island for two hours (albeit with Wilson) is a true testimony of his unique talent.
The problem is, once the film gets to the end, events get tiresome, where we are greeted with far too much exposition , and after a while, you start to get somewhat weary of the over-wrought sentiment.

Cast Away is also a very fine movie. Tom Hanks is the finest of actors. His work with Robert Zemeckis will no doubt set standards for an actor/director duo that will be hard to even approach. Hanks must carry this picture all by himself for well over half of the screen time. That he does so with seeming ease is not only a credit to him as an actor, but is also the mark of a truly great director.
This DVD version of the movie is very attractive. A double disc package, it does not skimp on extras as some movies (Harry Potter comes to mind here) have. The best parts are the feature on survival techniques, a Charlie Rose interview, and the story of Wilson.
Zemeckis' commentary is also a big, big plus. There is so much more to this movie than what meets the eye. The commentary helped me catch a lot of things I would have otherwise missed.

1284759,3,B00003CXRO,"Picture a young school-kid who has made a model of Camelot using wood and styrofoam. Picture the child as he or she happily walks to school, proud to turn his/her work into their history class for the eventual top grade. Now watch as fate intervenes as the child trips on an uneven curb, sending the model crashing to the ground. The child cries and sobs...and then looks up to see the model is still VERY much intact. The only thing the child DIDN'T super-glue to death were the little action-figurines used to portray the inhabitants of Camelot...and a tip of Arthur's tower is slightly wrecked.
It's fixable...but why go to the trouble when 99 percent of the project is very much okay and ready to present and will knock the socks off of all the other kids who used a simple shoebox to present the Round Table room???
This is the case for director Robert Zemeckis. Even though he sometimes stumbles, his stuff is still fun to watch. And it's because of beautiful special effects a very real(and VERY Oscar-worthy) performance by the ever-dynamic Tom Hanks, and a(mostly) smart script.
CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland(Hanks), a systems-engineer for the FedEx company(methinks FedEx had to be paid a TON to both sponsor the film and portray one of their delivery jets crashing and losing thousands of packages). He's obssessed with time and things going the way they're supposed to. His relationship is what it is: Chuck and his girlfriend, Kelly(the overrated Helen Hunt in an understated performance) see each other in short bursts but are very happy with the agreement they have and actually SMILE at each other during their day-to-day meetings.
Then comes Christmas Eve and Chuck's leaving his girlfriend again, but not before presenting her with a small ""proposal"" to think about...(Hunt's ""I'm scared"" line is rattled off as if she's telling a waiter to add cheese to a hamburger she ordered.) He's off to personally escort a few packages(God knows WHY he has to do this but the script demands it for plot-movement) to their destinations by Christmas Day. This scene comes complete with ill-fated dialogue and the totally clichd, ""I'll be right back"", spoken to Kelly(or yelled-to to be more accurate) by the equally ill-fated Chuck. I remember actually yelling at my T.V. set that you NEVER say that in a movie(see ""Scream"" and you'll know why) but what the heck do I know???
Once aboard, the pilots decide to avert a major storm by flying AROUND it...so much for THAT idea. The plane crashes into the South Pacific faster than a Randy Johnson-fastball and Chuck is outcast via a raft from said plane to a deserted island with no technology, no islanders, no Jurassic Park dinosaurs, and NO WAY TO GET HOME.
From here on, we get to watch Noland stumble around the island trying to obtain food, water, and shelter as well as an idea for how he's going to get off the island and get back to his life...all of which takes four years.
Now, before the nay-sayers comment that ""this could have been really good"" and call it BAD, I say that this could have been really BAD and I'm calling it good. It's actor Hanks and director Zemeckis's time and patience that pulls off the impossible(in their first re-teaming since ""Forrest Gump""). Noland turns desparate as you see him go through the stages of becoming a survivor(fear, anger, acceptance, etc.), befriend a volleyball(which he paints a face on with his own blood and even goes so far as to implant ""hair"" using twigs and what-not), create fire(in a frustratingly funny scene), and spear fish and crab for edible goods.
I've read both sides of the debate on this film and I'm caught in the middle. I think this movie is successful. Robert Zemeckis makes a film that touches you not so much on an emotional level(not even the stupid volleyball evoked a sniffle when we witness its fate), but on a philosophical level. Before Hanks hits the island, he's a hurried man who rushes everything and yells at the top of his lungs. After the island, he's transformed into something humbled. You would think he would have trouble accepting his new life after he gets back home...but by now, it's so easy to him. Chuck has survived the hell of isolation and pain by himself. He makes his decisions without sadness, without angst, and with much acceptance. It's the primitive equivalent of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".
Yes, the film's point is EXTREMELY heavy-handed: ""time is important so make the most of it"" and blah, blah, blah...but Zemeckis has such a wonderful way of softening the hand that's slapping you in the face(just like he softened it for ""Gump"" and the soft-spoken ""Contact""), that it's easy to take. His use of sound and the decision to NOT use Alan Silvestri's understated and gentle music score during the island-scenes was the perfect choice. In my opinion, scoring the island-scenes would have dumbed the film down.
Not a great film, not a horrible film. ""Castaway"" is a good film that shows you one man's accelerated journey through life in which he learns the true meaning of becoming a mature human being.
(A couple of notes here: the ""winking-whale"" effect comes off as silly and why doesn't search-and-rescue follow the trail of loose-drifting packages since most seemed to end up on the isle with Chuck???)

The Featurette on Wilson is funny and surprizingly informative. And the casting of the island was interesting, but not really needed in my opinion.

 Four years prior to this, he survived a plane crash that left him stranded in the South Pacific and presumed dead by family, friends, and colleagues.
 The years spent on that primitive isle are realistically boring and lonely for him. Viewers watch as a soccer ball with his bloody imprints becomes his best friend, his hair grows long, wild, and sun-bleached, and he grows mentally ill.
 By the time he is able to build a raft and finally free himself from his island prison, we realize how much Wilson has come to mean to him, and how Wilson has come to symbolize the human contact that Chuck so desperately craves.
 We feel sad that his wife, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, didn't pay attention to her gut instincts about whether or not her husband had survived, and instead listened to friends who told her to move on with her life.
 This film reminds me a little of ""Forever Young"", except that the ending leaves us hanging regarding the ultimate fate of the hero. But we know that at least now that he is back in civilization, his destiny is back in his own hands, and we wish him all the best.",1022976000,,1244,4.414847161572053
1284845,4,B00003CXRO,"I have seen this movie on HBO, and I had multiple feelings to it. Watching this movie, I had several different reactions.  One was the horror I felt during the crash scene--very horrifying.  Another was amazement-- amazement at what a person will do to survive under the most desperate circumstances.  Yet another reaction I had was sadness--I really felt sorry for Chuck as he was sobbing after losing Wilson, his only ""friend"" on the island.  I also felt sorry for him when he comes back home, eager to see his girlfriend after four long years, only to find that she is now married to someone else and has a child. I also felt that what happened to Chuck was a matter of fate--I think this incident needed to happen so that he could be forced to see what was really important in life-- the need to slow down and cherish relationships more.  ""Cast Away"" is a movie that will evoke your emotions as it did with me.",1022889600,,914,4.449101796407185
1284846,2,B00003CXRO,"Yes, yes, yes, Tom Hanks lost forty pounds to play a man marooned on an island for four years. It is too bad the director did not put that much effort into making a better movie.
This is one of those films that you like when the end credits roll, then wake up in the middle of the night and wonder why you suddenly dislike it.
There are over 400 other reviews on this site for this film, so I will spare you another detailed summary of the plot. When it comes right down to it, the plot is very minimal at best. On to the complaining:
Why does Zemeckis insist on using special effects for the most mundane scenes? I thought the Oscar winning effects for ""Forrest Gump"" were lousy. The scene I am talking about is an obvious CGI fish swimming in the water before getting speared by Hanks, who is dramatically thin after four years. Why the effect? A fake fish on string would have been more realistic.
What I disliked most about this film was the missed opportunities. Where was the scene where Hanks gets on the boat and explains his appearance? His reaction to loud noises after being on a tropical island alone? His reaction to getting back on a plane after going down in a plane at the beginning of the film? His inability to drive a car after four years of not being able to? I also would have liked to see Hanks gradually get used to island life. Instead, he stumbles around like Gilligan, then we jump forward four years later where he looks like a caveman, and is an old pro at island life. Couldn't we see how he adjusts? We know he is going to be rescued, so we are left with muddled scenes regarding his reunification with love of his life Helen Hunt, who is better in this than ""What Women Want.""
Where is the emotional reuniting of the pair, instead of the strained meeting when he goes to their house? She still has all of his stuff from the unsuccessful search, and his car, and yet he must go to her.
I really did not like the ambiguous ending. Normally, ambiguous endings are the result of the film makers deciding to do something different than the Hollywood norm. Here, it just seems that no one knew how to end this. Having Hanks look back up the road where Lori White had driven is nice, but what was in the package he left at her door? Sure, he is at a crossroads emotionally as well as physically, but the film makers try to be mysterious by leaving him there. Do not take me through two and a half hours with this guy, then leave the both of us hanging on a dirt road in Texas. Closure, darn it!
I cannot recommend ""Cast Away,"" despite the marketing and reputations of the cast and crew.
This is rated (PG13) for physical violence, gore, some profanity, and some adult situations.",1022803200,6,2703,4.322834645669292
1284847,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away has some flaws, including having a somewhat weaker third act and over-marketing (if you saw the previews, you might already know the entire plot), however the film is lead by Tom Hanks through most of the film, and I think that if you took the entire second act of the film by itself, you have 5 star movie.
Tom Hanks plays a fed-ex man who is always obsessed with time, and over the Christmas break he has to leave his girlfriend to go to Asia.  But, on his way there on the plane, it crashes in the ocean and he winds up on a deserted island with hardly any food and inevitably no future.  All he can survive on is his primal instincts, lessons learned either from boy scouts or 2001 (the movie), or on a few fed-ex supplies.  To see Hanks like this on the island, doing things is amazing enough.  There is one scene in particular where he is creating fire that might be one of the best scenes by itself ever.  The way he shows his eyes, the way the camera shows the fire being made, the face, even the look on the face of his inanimate volleyball Wilson, is extraordinary.  Speaking of which, even though the volleyball which is named Wilson (intentionally, but possibly not) never speaks, it and Hanks give one of the best on-screen duo's in years.  The fact that he can communicate with this lifeless yet quirkily funny sport's object and make it entertaining in some ways similar to Jay and Silent Bob, is just one of the film's triumphs.
Overall, not only does Tom Hanks give the best performance of the year, he gives his second best performance of his career.  Bravo to him and every scene on the island for making such a compelling presence, even if the film isn't completely it.",1022284800,2,1699,4.405750798722044
1284848,4,B00003CXRO,"With no little thanks to a cinematic trailer that revealed far too much of the movie it was selling, the plot of Cast Away could be seen from the distance between the mainland and the remote island that Tom Hanks finds himself marooned on. With a lesser actor in the lead role, this film could have been a straight-to-video release, but Hanks gives a compelling performance. The viewer is drawn into his world and feels the enormous despair his character inevitably endures during his four year stay, alone, on a small desert island with only a volleyball for company. The island scenes, which form the majority of the film's running time, are undoubtedly the highlight of the project. When Hanks is rescued (a sequence which seems rather rushed), his return to suburbia and the fiancee he left behind are filmed to the same standard as your average tv movie. Not bad, just not very interesting. The film ends inconclusively and on an anti-climatic note with Hanks left standing, quite literally, at a crossroads in his life. There is no sense of closure and it almost feels like a different film compared to what has gone on before. Worth renting for Hanks' performance, cementing his place as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars.",1021852800,3,1234,4.8254716981132075

1284850,4,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks gives a tour de force performance in ""Castaway"" a generally excellent survival story. Combining humour, pathos and drama, Tom Hanks deeply humanistic portrayal of a helplessly marooned Fed-ex employee  and Robert Zemeckis' cogent direction keep you involved through most of the film. As a frequent flier I found the crash sequence quite harrowing-my greatest nightmare graphically brought to life. Hanks struggle for survival seems generally quite believable, except why didn't he open all the packages that washed ashore? The only criticism I have is with the long and drawn out downbeat coda between Hanks and Helen Hunt. Surely some tighter editing could have been used here, instead I found myself thinking ""get on with it already!"". Still aside from this point I found ""Castaway"" to be both gripping and poignant and worth the investment of time.

The main difference between the two is that 2001 has intrigue, meaning, poetry, and vision.

It is hard to decide which is the better movie. I guess that what decides it for me is that the theme of boy meets volleyball, boy falls in love with volleyball, boy loses volleyball is a bit overdone.  This movie certainly a worthy addition the that genre, however.

1284956,5,B00003CXRO,"When I saw ""Cast Away"" in theaters back in the winter of 2000, I thought to myself on how brilliant the film was, and how brilliant the performance was from Academy-Award winner Tom Hanks (""Philadelphia"", Best Actor, 1993). The filmmakers said that ""Cast Away"" was filmed in some parts of Memphis, TN, mostly at the FedEx complex, etc. This is pretty much the fourth film to be filmed in Memphis (the first three were John Grisham films based on his novels: ""The Firm"", ""The Client"", and ""The Rainmaker""). The film focuses on a FedEx systems engineer named Chuck Noland (Hanks), who is obsessed with his job in which he comments: ""we live and we die by time"". Chuck has a beautiful life with his girlfriend Kelly (Helen Hunt). When Chuck gets an unexpected call on his pager, he decides to take it. But after Chuck steps inside the airplane, it has engine trouble and crashes in the ocean. Chuck manages to survive the outcome of it and gets washed away to an island nearby. There he spends 4 years of his life fighting insanity by talking to a volleyball, in which he named ""Wilson"", and how he still manages to survive and figure out a way back home. Robert Zemeckis (""What Lies Beneath"") directed this movie with lots of emotion and powerful storytelling as well. I purchased ""Cast Away"" in its 2-DVD set with lots of extras including behind-the-scenes footage, trailers, TV spots, commentaries, and more. But now, Fox Home Entertainment has re-released ""Cast Away"" again, this time as a one-disc treatment. And this time, you do not get all those extra goodies that are inside the 2-disc set, except for just commentaries, scene selection, and that's it. And, to me, that is just a cheap representation of the real thing (the 2-disc set). In other words, it's not good. But, all in all, this is Tom Hanks' best film since ""Philadelphia"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""The Green Mile"". ""Cast Away"" is nothing short of being truly entertaining or emotional.",1017100800,,1957,4.758823529411765

1284959,5,B00003CXRO,"While watching CAST AWAY, a quote from another movie, THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, kept coming to mind; ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying."" That quote sums up CAST AWAY. It is a movie about surviving and making choices.
Tom Hanks plays Chuck, a Fed-Ex trouble-shooter who is so constrained by time that he plans dates with his girlfriend months in advance. Chuck get called on an emergency assignment and his plane ends up crashing into the ocean. Chuck is the only survivor, but is abandoned on a deserted island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean. The rest of the film revolves around Chuck's quest for survival and his re-education in living.
This is a Tom Hanks movie, make no doubt about it. He helped write it, produce it, and stars in it. However, if CAST AWAY was simply a Tom Hanks film and nothing more, it would have sunk faster than the drowning plane in the movie.
CAST AWAY is unlike any other film I have ever seen. Most people are sick of their existance in life and go to movies to be entertained. This movie is entertaining, but it's not just an entertainment film. This is a film that was made to make people think. The movie explores man's existance and forces one to ponder the important and not so important things of life: what truly is important in life? What do you most revere? What makes a friend? How strong is love? These are all questions that CAST AWAY forces one to examine. But the most important question of all is whether to get busy living or get busy dying.",1016150400,2,1538,4.476868327402135
1284960,2,B00003CXRO,"Many viewers were blown away by Cast Away, but I was not one of them. Much of the enjoyment of the movie depends on whether or not you are a Tom Hanks fan. I'm not all that impressed by him, and I assume that puts me in the minority. I believe the terms 'actor' and 'star' are not interchangeable. There have always been stars who are also consummate actors; however, one does not need a broad range of acting skills in order to be a star - or, for that matter, to win awards. Hanks is a star of the first magnitude. He can 'open' a picture because his legions of fans are going to flock to anything he is in. He likes to be in different kinds of movies, but, no matter what he is in, I am always aware that I am watching Tom Hanks.
This time he plays Chuck Noland, a revved-up, stressed out manager at FedEx. He flies all over the world helping to make the package delivery giant ever more efficient. He is obsessed with time. It is Christmas, and he is about to ask Kelly [Helen Hunt] to marry him. Even this important moment is interrupted when he is called away for yet another flight to solve another company emergency. This time he doesn't make it. The plane crashes in the South Pacific, and Chuck, the only survivor, manages to make it to a deserted island. He is trapped in a place where time becomes irrelevant. Even his watch doesn't work. His survival tools are limited to a motley assortment of FedEx packages that washed ashore with him. Now he must learn whether or not the survival skills he honed in civilization will have any use in a place where civilization has no meaning.
The production values are high in Cast Away. The plane crash, for example, is terrifyingly realistic and filled with first-rate special effects. Its the high point of the movie, but I don't think that's what its makers intended. The part where Noland is marooned on the island is well photographed and succeeds in capturing the character's utter aloneness and his descent into madness It is also a very long sequence, running nearly an hour and a half. After a while, there is only so much you can do with a character who has only a soccer ball to talk to. It was so long that it gave me time to think about how I was watching a very rich star doing a good impression of someone trapped on a deserted island. I began to picture Hank's big air-conditioned trailer and the mounds of gourmet food that lurked just out of camera range.
Anyone who saw Cast Away's trailer knows whether Noland makes it off the island or not. For those who did not see it, I won't give away the ending. I will say that it is one the oddest and least inspired ones I've seen in a long time.",1016150400,3,2660,4.322

Over the span of four years Chuck is on the island, until he devises a plan to get off of the island and return home.  The drama between Chuck and his lone ""companion"", a volleyball he calls Wilson, is heartbreaking when he loses him at sea.  In my opinion this is Tom Hanks' finest film, he should have gotten Best Actor instead of Russel Crowe, and the special effects when the plane crashes are great as well.  Helen Hunt is wasted in her role as Chuck's girlfriend, and I would have liked to see more in depth of how Chuck's character develops on the island, and how he coped with the changes when he got home.

On the overall scale it does make one appreciate every moment of life as we never know what tomorrow will bring.  Unlike ""The Blue Lagoon"" filmed years ago this protrays man in a truer sense of abandonment on an Island all alone with no one to talk to.

1285067,5,B00003CXRO,"This movie reminds me of ""Forrest Gump"" because of the sentimental themes, the subtle, creative symbols, and the proactive, determined struggle of the main character, which happens to be played by Tom Hanks in both movies.
The theme of this movie is about what is really important.  Chuck Noland (pun for ""no land"") works for Federal Express and oversees time management.  He thinks time is wasting and he doesn't know how right he is.  He's constantly working and flying all over the world.  He exchanges Christmas gifts with his girlfriend at the airport in the car then hands her a wrapped gift which is obviously an engagement ring.  He tells her to hold on to it until New Years Eve, and promises he'll be with her then.  She gave him a family heirloom pocket watch with her picture in it.  He says he'll always keep it set to Dallas time and then rushes to his plane, which tragically crashes into the ocean.
He is the sole survivor but luckily he managed to float on a liferaft overnight and by morning stumbled upon a small uninhabited island.  This is where he begins being what is called proactive-- he deals best he can with what life dealt him.  He is resourceful and exercises initiative.  The bulk of the movie, his stay on the island, is very unique because he is the only human being shown, there is no music, yet it never ceases to be fascinating.  He could just wither away and die or even commit suicide, which he almost does, but he decides to live.  But for what?  Namely for his girlfriend, whom he thinks about constantly and keeps the pocketwatch open to her picture.  Symbolically, while the plane was losing control, he dropped the watch and risked his life to get it before it fell out of the broken plane.  The plane crash symbolizes the harm of overcommitment to work and being too busy and focused on schedules and time.  The watch symbolizes his life back at civilization.  The plane crash made the watch stop ticking.  I also think he decides to live just for the sake of life itself even with all its discomforts.  A great turning point and memorable scene of the movie is when he bravely decides to voyage off the island on a raft he constructed.  He could easily die in the middle of the ocean but the reward is to possibly get back to civilization.
The reason it is a turning point in the movie is because when he gets back, it actually seems as if he were better off on the island.  As he's floating away from the island, he looks back at it and you can feel that he will miss it because of all his hard work, all he went through, and all he achieved.  Notice the title of the movie is ""Cast Away"" not ""Castaway"".  This is because the real point is that being cast away by his lover was worse than being a castaway for four years.  On the island, he yearned for companionship so bad he actually developed a relationship with a volleyball.  Of course everyone thought he was long dead, including his girlfriend.  So she married someone else and had kids.  His friends throw a party for him, but he seems the least happy one there, thinking of whether or not he'll get his girlfriend back.  Her husband greets him awkwardly as we would expect him to and explains that his wife is confused and doesn't want to see him right away.  However, he should have at least prepared a little better as to what to say to him and been friendlier.  Symbolically, he is a dentist and once performed a root canal on Chuck.  At this point, I really felt contempt for her new husband and I was rooting for Chuck.  I felt he deserved her after all he went through and how he never stopped loving her even after being away for four years.
She seems ambivalent and confused at first, having meetings with Chuck and showing him the news articles and scrapbook she has of him and how she kept the Jeep that they were in together last at the airport.  As he drives away in it, she chases him and kisses him and tells him he's the love of her life.  Yet, her decision soon becomes clear as she goes back to her new husband, expensive house, and children.  I felt so sad for Chuck.
Of all the packages that washed ashore, he kept the last one unopened.  He finally delivered it in person when he got back.  Saving this package for that purpose shows his determination and hope for the future.  Why else would he have saved it?  Just like in Forrest Gump, this is a subtle, curious action.  He leaves a note saying the package saved his life.  No one is home and we never learn what was in the package or their response.  The package was of no tangible use to him like the contents of the other packages but it was the hope that he would be able to deliver it that saved his life.  As he's leaving, he stands at a crossroads.  He's out west where miles of flat ground stretch all around him.  A pretty, vivacious woman drives up and tells him the names of each of the roads and where they lead.  I wondered why he just let her drive away when she seems interested in him and he's single trying to get over a lost love.  The movie ends there, with Chuck standing at the crossroads not knowing where to go next, symbolizing how his life has been turned upside down twice and the big question on his mind is, ""Now what?""  The messages of the movie are that close relationships are more important than working and that we've got to do the best we can with the cards life deals us.",1013558400,6,5384,4.358433734939759
1285068,5,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away is not only great entertainment, it's a movie that leaves the viewer feeling better able to cope with his/her own difficulties after seeing it.
It does this without showing superhuman effort by a superhuman man.
It show instead the superhuman efforts done by an ordinary man.
Chuck Nolan, an international manager for Federal Express, is a nice-looking middle-manager who is middle-aged and going soft in the middle as he moves into his middle 40s.
Nothing about him stands out except that he is a hard worker, and well-thought-of in Fed Ex circles. If he has one great talent, it is his life-long  ability to manage his time and get the job done.
His life is not all about business, however.
The love of his life is graduate student Helen Hunt. He has friends, family, and the acclaim of his colleagues, yet he is somewhat disconnected from it all. For example, he finds it easier to recommend a good cancer specialist to a friend whose wife is dying rather than express his own sympathies.
He wants to propose to his girlfriend at Christmas, but instead accepts a last-minute Fed Ex assignment that interrupts a Christmas Eve dinner and takes him away from her.
Of course, that fateful decision ultimately sends his world into a tailspin - and the Pacific Ocean. He washes up on what some might see as an idyllic island.
As he faces a number of hideous trials and plots, we become thoroughly connected to this displaced person. We root for him, for his survival against overwhelming lonliness and depression and hardship.
We realize that Chuck Nolan's struggle is one that happens to all of us, in countless ways when we somehow become disconnected from what really matters in life.",1013472000,,1694,4.7815699658703075
1285167,4,B00003CXRO,"The theme of the cast away goes back long before Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe (1660-1731) or The Swiss Family Robinson by Johann Wyss (1781-1830); indeed it probably goes back to a time when people first set out on the open sea in boats.  It is a wonderfully romantic genre, employing the classic ""man versus nature"" theme while allowing us to indulge in the fantasy of escape from the confines and restrictions of civilization.
Here we have Tom Hanks as Chuck Nolan, a Fed Ex executive whose plane ditches into the South Pacific ocean.  He washes up on a tiny, desert island as the sole survivor of the plane crash.  (Incidentally, both ""des-ert island"" and ""de-serted island"" are correct, the words ""des-ert' and ""de-serted"" in this context meaning the same thing.)  His four-year stay on the island forms the bulk of the movie, but perhaps the most engaging part for most movie-goers is what happens afterwards.
Tom Hanks was excellent throughout, as usual, and the direction by Robert Zemeckis from a script by William Broyles Jr. was compelling.  Especially good was the irony about what happens to Chuck's beloved (Helen Hunt) while he is gone.  This has been done before (but I forget where), and is the kind of heart-wrenching development that could have been pure saccharin but instead came across as thought-provoking, veracious and very affecting.
Zemeckis also directed the excellent film, Contact (1997), made from the novel by Carl Sagan.  We can see here (and there) that Zemeckis's work owes a lot to the influence of Steven Spielberg in both a positive and a negative sense.  Zemeckis, like Spielberg, can be cloying at times in his effort to secure the audience's identification.  We can see this in the beginning with Chuck cutely trying to sell efficiency to the Russians with the help of a little boy.  But splendid was the plane crash sequence, the kind of thing Spielberg would want to be intensely vivid, and it was.  And later the startling sight of the huge cargo ship, like a sea-going skyscraper, recalled to mind the first shot of the spaceship from Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977).  The Fed Ex packages flying out all over the world engendering a kind of corporate ""we're all one world"" feeling like something from a Coca-Cola commercial was pure Spielberg.
But what I like to do when I look at a movie like this is to lean forward and scrutinize it for authenticity.  Did the cast away lose weight?  Yes, as a matter of fact, Tom Hanks must have dropped about ten pounds, or perhaps he fattened up for the first part of the film (or was that body cosmetology?) and then fasted for the scenes showing him four years later.  But did he lose enough weight?  For those who have been watching TV's ""Survivor,"" we know he didn't.  And was he tan enough?  His hair was little lighter after his ordeal, but he really needed to be baked a dark brown, which he wasn't.
I also look at how he ate.  What was his source of vitamin C?  Do coconuts contain Vitamin C?  I don't know.  But showing him eating seaweed, which does contain vitamin C, would have worked.  Using the coconuts to hold water was a nice touch.  Learning to spear fish with a wooden spear is plausible, but spearing a fish with a wooden spear in the open ocean is unlikely.  Notice there were no birds or bird eggs or bird guano on the island.  An uninhabited island in the middle of the ocean is always a nesting place for birds.
This last observation reveals that the setting was not in fact a tiny island but part of a larger body of land.  Notice there was no clear, encircling shot of the island (as from the air).  In fact we never see the other side of the island.
It was interesting to see how he got the fire going (again ""Survivor"" fans--and boy scouts--know how hard that is to do), but I was thinking that maybe he could have used the glass on the watch face or from the flashlight as a way to concentrate sunlight to make a fire.
I also watched to see whether he did what I would have done.  Of course what I would have done doesn't mean that much, but I would not have left the island for the open ocean (which seemed almost suicidal), unless there was out there on that ocean a ship's corridor, so to speak, which is possible.  Of course, who can say what a man might do after being four years entirely alone on a tiny island?  I also would not have tried to cure my toothache, regardless of how bad it hurt, by breaking the tooth off with the ice skates.  After all, that might make things worse.  Trying to pull the tooth would have been my strategy--but how?
I liked the irony of finding the ice skates in a washed up Fed Ex package, and then Chuck's use of the blades as mirror and  knife.  I know why he didn't take the dead man's clothes, but I think he should have plugged his nose and peeled them off anyway.  The washed up metal ""sail"" was a nice inspiration, and there were many others: the ""discovery"" of tool-making by striking the vocanic rock at the right angle; burning the base of the trees to make wood for the raft; the petroglyphs he made in the cave; sleeping on the floor in the hotel room, etc.

1285168,5,B00003CXRO,"Well, people go back and forth with negative to positive in their opinions of Cast Away - as probably with most movies - but I will actually go out on a limb and state that I cannot fathom why anyone in their right mind would not like (or love for that matter) this movie!!  I always enjoy Tom Hanks but that is beside the point with this gem.
The key is to place yourself as best as possible with Tom's character Chuck Noland.  I feel that his execution of emotions and reactions to his situation are exactly what you would expect to go through.  He is shocked, then confused, then lonely, then desperate, then content - and so on.
I came away from this movie with a much higher appreciation for life itself.  I appreciate the people and things I have in my life.  If you take the time to immerse yourself, just once, into this movie I am positive you will come away with at least a tinge of appreciation for some aspect of your life.
Gush gush - ya maybe - but sit back for about 15 minutes (or more if needed) and imagine yourself on an island all alone - for 4 years - you might find inspiration from Chuck and gratitude for such a fine movie having been produced.

1285286,3,B00003CXRO,"Being led into a deception is annoying enough.  Leading yourself down some primrose path to confront disappointment is downright awkward.  ""Tom Hanks"" must mean this will be a film worth investment, right?  Wrong on nearly all counts.  Tom Hanks is a fine actor.  He does a memorable job in this film.  He conveys the agony of isolation with lively intensity.  The viewer shares his struggles with sympathy as he draws you into his daily acts of survival.  Hanks is a superb actor.  The pity is the material he's been given to work with.  No matter how adroitly he conveys the desire to survive in isolation, carrying the memory of his  abandoned love, Helen Hunt, the film is predictable from start to finish.  There isn't a single surprise in this latest entry in Hollywood's Robinson Crusoe sweepstakes.
The transformation of a shallow man into someone bringing hidden abilities to bear on a difficult situation is a favourite Hollywood theme.  If it's done well, we can all identify with the individual.  This is Hanks' special talent.  He's done it elsewhere, and he does it superbly here.  A mid-level executive in the FedEx courier firm, he operates under a compulsion to succeed.  He does it by driving others to match his pace.  Thrown on his own resources on a lonely Pacific island, Chuck Noland must develop new skills and strengths.  They're not readily forthcoming as Hanks expresses so well.  When he finds FedEx packages from the wrecked aircraft, his hesitation at opening them is manifest.  It must be the ultimate transgression for a FedEx employee.  Ludicrous as the discovery of ice skates seems, of course they prove valuable tools on the island.  The transformation of another find, a volleyball, into his alter ego is pure Hanks.  He carries the film in splendid isolation.
That isolation, given the cast, is this film's greatest shortcoming.  Bringing Helen Hunt into this film in ""bookend"" scenes at the beginning and end is to do an outstanding actress a great disservice.  Instead, we are given Bill Broyles' experiences in survival schools imparted through Tom Hanks.  Had Zemekis goaded Broyles into broader vision, this film might have been redeemed.  Hunt could have portrayed her grief at his loss and whatever led her to follow the path ultimately revealed.  Slipping from the level of work he achieved in earlier films, Broyles here slips into simplistic and trite formulas.  Hanks calls ""I'll be right back!"" to Hunt before entering the aircraft.  Did any viewer doubt they wouldn't see each other until the film approached its finale?  Worse, the caption ""Four Years Later"" flashes on the screen and you know what must inevitably follow.  Hunt's other ""bookend"" appearance begins with her fainting, a totally inappropriate event for someone who exudes strength.  Even relaxed, Hunt couldn't assume a ""shrinking violet"" role, yet Broyles forces that unlikely role here.
If you're a Hanks fan, this is a film to view once.  If you're a Hunt fan, you may enjoy the brevity of her appearance, which is hardly to her credit.  If you want a captivating story, well presented and rich with innovation, you'll be only partly satisfied.  Watch it once and pass it on.  Anyone wishing to own a copy may contact this reviewer for a bargain deal.  Perhaps you could also explain why the film's title is incorrect grammar.

He bonds with a volleyball, ""Wilson,"" which represents many things: the protagonist's need for a friend, conscience, and is, with its blood-stained face, even a reminder of the protagonist's mortality.
So much of the struggle on the island is so universal that people from all over the world could follow the sequences without the aid of subtitles. Primitive and biblical themes are wonderfully developed: the making of fire, the arduous learning process of trial and error, the ecstasy of tasting food as if for the first time.
During the protagonist's struggles he learns to grieve and to find a cathartic way to unleash all his pent up sorrow, as when he loses his volleyball companion ""Wilson,"" and in doing so he finds his humanity.
So much detail and mythic power informs the island sequences that it is a frustrating disappointment when we arrive at the movie's final act, the protagonist's attempt to patch things up with his girlfriend, who, having thought he had died in a plane crash, has married and borne children. This final act is sloppy, sappy, and arbitrary and seems to have been made by a lesser director.

1285374,2,B00003CXRO,"This tired retelling of the Robinson Crusoe story is not only dull, it's also distinctly ordinary.  Whilst Zemeckis touched his audience with 'Forrest Gump' and scared them all with 'What Lies Beneath', this is a film that seems to have been released purely to show us all Tom Hanks' formidable acting skills.  In the film Hanks plays Chuck, who is separated from his wife after his plane crashes and he, the only survivor, is forced to eke out an existence on a tropical island for four years, forging a friendship with a ball called Wilson.
Whilst Hanks' acting is undoubtedly good, he always seems to play Mr. Joe Regular and the scenes on the island are incredibly dull.  We see Chuck light a fire, smash a coconut and fish.  This makes up the majority of the movie, with themes such as madness being explained away with a frankly bizarre 'friendship' with a ball.  In this lies the movie's main failure - it's not particularly bad but it is particularly dull.  Devoid of any other characters - save Helen Hunt as his wife in a role so minimal it even rivals Laura Dern's in 'Jurassic Park III' - we're forced to concentrate on the same things over and over.
Still, the airplane crash is stunningly done and the ending is thankfully a little less contemporary than would be expected.  Yet compared alongside, Zemeckis' other film that year - 'What Lies Beneath' - this is nothing.

1285380,2,B00003CXRO,"Bravo to the makers of ""Castaway"" - you have really created a truly amusing film.  Amusing, but only when viewed as a comedy, and not the deep and touching drama this was meant to be.  The film starts off on archetypal note: a man (Tom Hanks) is so pathetically obsessed with his job at a mail company it is obvious things will change and he will become a good man in the end.  Yet things take an unexpected turn on this ""deep"" journey when Tom Hanks' plane crashes and he drags himself to a nearby island.  He is - predictably - the only survivor.  Things stop being serious when Tom Hanks attempts to continue controlling all job-related things.  It seems he spends the first half of the movie screaming as he speeds down a hill towards whatever mail has washed up.  The best part of this movie is the friend he creates out of a ball that came from one of many packages that wash up.  He gives it a little face and speaks to it, calling it ""Wilson"".  Their relationship has both good and bad times.  Like any normal couple, they fight with each other.  They laugh together and cry together.  The only problem is that they are not a couple; it's only a ball.  Their relationship reaches its low point during a really savage fight.  In the end Tom Hanks tosses his better half and it bounces out of the cave he calls home.  In a wave of regret he rushes outside and frantically searches for Wilson in the dark night.  The movie wraps up after Tom's return to civilization; he is driving his car (with a wilson ball inside) around in the middle of nowhere.  He stands in the road signaling that he is making life-changing decisions and the movie closes on that completely undecided note.

Whether the film succeeds or not is not what's important to me.

Robert Zemeckis is one of those few directors that succeeds in this time and time again. From the brilliance of ""Contact,"" to the fun of the ""Back To The Future"" franchise, to the warmth of ""Forrest Gump,"" Mr. Zemeckis has always had a way of telling a story that makes you think differently afterwards about your own.

1285455,2,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away (Robert Zemeckis, 2000)

Okay, I have to get this out of my system right now. ""Castaway"" is ONE WORD. Not two. ONE.

And now, on with the review.

It has been a painfully long time since Robert Zemeckis made a good film (Peter Jackson was responsible for The Frighteners, Zemeckis only lent his name); depending on your point of view, that could be Death Becomes Her, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, Back to the Future, or if you're _really_ a purist, Used Cars. Cast Away was the great white hope, the movie that would bring Robert Zemeckis' career back from the grave he'd dug with such abominable tripe as Forrest Gump and What Lies Beneath.

Sorry. No luck.

In two and a half tortuously long hours, Zemeckis leads Tom Hanks through Christmas dinner, a plane ride, three raft trips, another plane ride, a taxi, and an SUV. And while there are a few other supporting players in the movie (Helen Hunt, a woefully underused Chris Noth, an even more woefully underused Lari White in her first big-screen appearance since the Ben Cross vehicle The Unholy twelve years before), make no mistake-- this movie is about Tom Hanks and His Ability to Act. Because of that, the only relationship in the movie that actually makes any sense is that which Hanks forms with his well-known pal Wilson, the volleyball who keeps him company during his stint on the island. (In Zemeckis' favor, the volleyball never does develop a voice. I feared that for about an hour.)

Given that the movie IS about THaHATA, one wonders why we really needed that hour or so of frame time that surrounded THaHATA. What's Helen Hunt doing here? Despite her role as Hanks' wife-to-be at the beginning and the yardstick we are (presumably) supposed to use to judge how the world has gone on without him at the end, her relatinoahip with Hanks is far less convincing than Wilson's. Like Noth and White, a good actor in a bad role.

Trimming forty-five minutes of frame would have made this watchable, at least. As it stands now, rent it if you like Tom Hanks and have a coupon for a ninety-nine cent rental. **",1006732800,2,2079,4.617886178861789

It was your typical stranded on a desert island story.  Man loves girl, man gets stranded on desert island, man is found in sea by boat, man has lost girl.  The only 'cute' difference in this movie was the many tools that the castaway invented from the various things he found in unopened Fed Express packages.  The most noticable being 'Wilson' the basketball who Tom befriends from utter boredom.  I love Tom Hanks movies but this one wasn't as entertaining as his previous blockbusters.  Still, it's worth watching at least once.",1005955200,,660,4.848214285714286
1285458,3,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks is the primary reason this film works and why anyone would commit to watching a movie about a man who is stranded alone on an island for four years.  Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express exec who is driven by time and efficiency which have no meaning once he's cast onto a remote tropical island.
*** Chuck scratches the surface of insanity trying to eke out an existence.  He forages, he laps rain water puddled in leaves, and he spears fish.  It's pathetic, but each accomplishment in stone age living is poignant in its way.  His loneliness is hugely palpable throughout his ordeal.
*** For such a major studio production, it's amazing not to have the extravagant trappings of costuming, makeup, special effects, and stunts.  Dialogue virtually disappears once Hanks' character reaches the island, save for the one-sided exchanges he has with his sole companion -- a volleyball he names ""Wilson.""  Even the musical score is held back for much of the movie, and when it does re-emerge, you realize you're back on more familiar territory after extreme deprivation.
*** The film is fully realized but oddly unsatisfying.  There's an impersonal pall over the movie that the viewer can't quite shake.  However, the bonus disc interview by Charlie Rose with Tom Hanks is very winning.  Hanks is articulate, accessible, and extremely thoughtful as he talks about ""Cast Away,"" ""Private Ryan,"" and ""Band of Brothers"" (his HBO miniseries based on the Stephen Ambrose book).",1005782400,5,1483,4.995934959349594

It is definitely a ""thinking movie"" and comes close to being a romance although there isn't enough time to really develop relationships with other characters.  A very challenging premise, this movie could have easily turned out to be a boring disappointment, but the challenge was met and the film shines.
Hanks must act with himself and develops a relationship with ""Wilson"" on the island, which turns out to be an experience well worth watching and reflecting about.

All of the extra footage only seems to accentuate the paltriness of the movie - which is nothing much more than a committee-led travesty (something like your latest PTA meeting).

1285541,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away is a very powerful and emotional film.  When I first viewed this film I was taken by the struggles Tom Hanks went through as he lived on a deserted island all by himself for many many years.  The hour long silence provided an effective way to build the suspense of the movie.  It was amazing to see the transformations that Tom Hanks took both physically and mentally.  His one and only companion for so many years was a Wilson volleyball.  The most emotional impact took place when his ""friend"" was lost at sea.  It allows us to come to realize how much we take for granted and how we should appreciate everything we have.

1285544,4,B00003CXRO,"The concept ""Cast Away"" is meant to be a metaphor for stripping away or casting away all the trappings of a normal, modern existence, thereby finding out what is truly important in life.
With a breathtaking performance, Tom Hanks played Chuck Noland, FedEx systems engineer whose life is ruled by the clock as his demanding job propels him across the world with hardly a second notice. His manic life comes to an abrupt halt as he's flying to Tahiti in a FedEx plane, which crashes during a storm over the South Pacific. He got stranded on an island for four years with no one to talk with, except his dear friend, ""Wilson"", the volleyball. While his fiancee and co-workers assume he's dead, he must give up everything that he once took for granted and learn how to survive both physically and emotionally.
Cast Away is a model of restrained storytelling that's studded with a series of pure emotional peaks. Ultimately compelling and human, it teaches every viewer that surviving is not really living at all. Tom Hanks had conveyed that desperation beautifully with simple gestures and deeply expressive eyes devoid of hope. The movie is trying to impart a lesson of determination and the will to survive. Such a very good movie to recommend for viewing since it portrays a very good picture, although not really a perfect comparison of almost everyone's life affected by the current worldwide economic pitfulls and the worsening socio-political problem of terrorism. Everyone in his/her own way is challenged to survive and to hold on tight to the rope in order not to fall by believing in oneself and to have the courage to go through the difficulties and not by facing one's back.
The production design and musical of the movie are outstanding, as well as the direction of Zemeckis. The acting, especially by Hanks, is top rate. But in terms of story and pacing, the whole of ""Cast Away"" is a lot less than the sum of its parts.",1003190400,4,1932,4.752976190476191
1285545,5,B00003CXRO,"What other actor could we spend nearly 3hrs with and never once feel the need to glance at our watch or worry that we're getting to the end of our popcorn? This is not a movie that tricks us into thinking we got our money's worth. No musclebound hero wages a one man war against injustice. Music will not swell at opportune moments coaxing our tear ducts into over-drive. We don't have to take sides and nobody gets naked. Sounds dull, huh? Well, if your interests tend toward pretty/handsome, fast, loud, manipulative and titillating, don't bother seeing this movie. On the other hand, if you prefer substance over flash then this is the movie you'll want to see. In my opinion, Tom Hanks gives a performance that, over time, will come to be known as one of the single most magnificent acting accomplishments ever. It's hard to explain, but somehow Hanks allows us to re-visit and vicariously share the feeling of the first time. His physical and emotional transformation is nothing short of miraculous. You'll want to pay particular attention to his initial reactions to sounds the island makes. I laughed and cried at how he is repeatedly tricked into thinking he is getting the hang of his predicament. Also of interest is his characters' realization that he really doesn't know what he knows. But it's a good thing because it leaves him open to possibilities and ultimate triumph. The rest of the movie and the other performances are incidental. There is just enough of it to make us understand why his not being in that world matters. Don't watch this movie with any expectaions.

Second of all, I love to be entertained.  And this movie did it for me.  I don't understand how some people can give it a hard time.  They say the storyline was boring, they say the ending was lackluster.  They just don't find it a very engaging movie.
Okay, that's all well and fine.  Everyone is entitled to their opinion.  But this is where those people and I differ.
I don't go to movies looking for some meaning, spiritual or otherwise, to change my life.  I don't really care about whether the storyline makes sense.  I go to and watch movies for the entertainment value, and ""Cast Away"" entertained the heck out of me.
I will admit that the first 20 or so minutes of this movie are a bit slow.  And I will also admit that the ending leaves much to be desired.  It's always a disappointment when anything you're engaged in just stops, and this movie falls right into that category.  But everything in between, from that heart-racing plane crash sequence (without a doubt the most realistic plane crash you will see in a movie) to all the different ways that Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is put through the rigger are great.
There is very little musical score in this movie, but that only enhances the ""isolated feeling"" that one is to feel while watching the movie.  When it does come, it sweeps you away and tugs at your heart.
In short, I thought this movie was great.  I loved everything on the island, I thought Wilson was a great side-character (definitely the best acting volleyball I've ever seen), and so many other things that I won't go into here.
If you haven't seen it yet, give it a chance.  Just forget about life for a couple of hours and let it effect you the way it effected me.",1002758400,2,1929,4.334261838440112

Tom Hanks does an excellent performance in Cast Away. I think this is one of the best movies of the year.
DVD picture is labelled 2.35:1 but it is actually 1.85:1 which is the Cast Away's theathical aspect ratio. Picture quality is very good for an NTSC format. There's no notable noise and colors are superb. DVD includes both Dolby Digital EX and DTS ES soundtracks. Personally I prefer DTS, because it's a bit more aggressive than the Dolby one.

Just by looking at the trailer, you would know that it would be a long, dragging, mostly-one-charactered story.  But what really caught my attention till the end was the great portrayal by Tom Hanks.  He led us to see his day-to-day survival in a forsaken island.  He made us realize that there are so many things in this world that we take for granted & we ONLY realize their importance when we lose them.
Yes, it was an adventure in a way but not something you would consider impossible or absurd.  On the contrary, most if not all of the events, were very real & believable.  Chuck's survival was a great adventure.  It's very real that the only thing that kept Chuck going was hope to be reunited with his love one.  On the other hand, it is also very real (painful as it may be) that the 'surviving mate' would go on  with her life, no matter how much she loves her partner.
The absence of the typical ""Hollywood happy-ending"" kind of stuff really makes this film truly unique & commendable.  It takes patience, understanding & realism to bear watching this film.

Tom Hanks' incredible change in body composition in the movie really shows how dedicated he was and adds a lot to the cinematic experience.  He goes from a well fed FED-EX worker to a skin and bones cast away.  It was really brave of Tom Hanks to accept doing this movie knowing that he would be the only character on screen for a large portion of the film.  He held the audience's attention well and this movie is a success.  The reason why I gave this movie a four was because of the ending.  It was not totally satisfying.

It's an epic Hollywood blockbuster type with a name actor and director that is actually brilliant, classy, and worth all of it. Usually, those types of films are hollow and eye candy.

Chuck ends up spending four years on that island. His only companion is a volleyball named Wilson. Chuck wonders about his girlfriend back home, who's played by Helen Hunt. Hanks' performance is a one man showstopper. He proves again why he is such a loved and respected performer. He deserves all of the attention and respect. He deserved the Oscar instead of Russell Crowe. Crowe wasn't anything stand-outish. If Hanks hadn't of won twice already, he would've won this too. Helen Hunt is usually good, but she is given way less to do here to really review. Her end scenes with Hanks are pretty good tho. This movie defied all odds. It was one man on a deserted island for the majority of the film. Tons of film were without dialogue and music. Very risky and brave. Director Robert Zemeckis pulled it off brilliantly. He always does. This is a great, up-lifting, spiritual film that would make anybody feel better about themselves for seeing this. This is a Hollywood classic.

Maybe a change wouldn't be so bad...Anyways, his character was pretty intelligent and he reacted just like I would have reacted...except for the swear words...he didn't even say one F-word. And Zemeckis really convinced me that Tom Hanks' Volley ball was his friend...I even felt stupid after the movie because of that. The backgrounds made me feel like I was in paradise. And this film is an exception to his genre, and it's a very good thing; He was always alone on his island, there were no stupid cannibal tribes or anything. It's like Robinson Crusoe, but with its own advantages, and its own weak points. This is surely a good movie, and I'm sure it will get some Academy Award Nominations, because it's exactly the kind of films that will touch the heart of the judges and please to their ""Right to Censorship"" mind. Most of it was a good moment, but the other parts suffered of the pathetic syndrome.

You are thinking throughout the film 'would I propose marriage to this lady? Would I open the packages that weren't addressed to me? Would I try to kill myself?

I had a lot of questions after wacthing this movie like ""Why was Kelly screeming Jack when running down her drivway his name was Chuck!"", and ""How Chuck he her screeming he was down the street?"", also ""How could a whale save Chuck wouldn't the whale eat him?"", also ""Why did Chuck talk to a volleyball?"", another is ""What happenes to Chuck in the end?"". It is hard for a movie to be good when the supporting character is an inanimate object!",1001116800,,1941,4.189839572192513
1285713,5,B00003CXRO,"This movie can be viewed from different levels. On the outside, the film is a great survival story of a man stranded on an uninhabitated island. Chuck Noland, the main character played by Tom Hanks, finds several inventive ways to live off the land, and the viewer is brought into the film by observing Noland's actions and tactics in confronting the sobering isolation.
On a deeper level, this movie deals with some moving themes, expressed through powerfully symbolic methods. In the first part of the movie, Chuck Noland (whose name is also metaphorical)is a top ""Federal Express"" employee obsessed with racing against time. Time is a major idea that permeates throughout the entire feature, and symbols of time appear and reappear. Noland's outlook on time changes as the movie progresses. In the end, he has to deal with what fate has dictated to him. Hanks compelling performance in the concluding scenes is moving and captivating. I have heard some complain about the ending of the film, but for me this was the most essential part of the entire piece. For me, it presented a metaphorical situation that represents a point that, in different ways, everyone faces at sometime in life. I feel that only top movies should be issued into the home library, and CAST AWAY is definitely one of them.",1001030400,3,1299,4.882352941176471

1285716,3,B00003CXRO,"""Cast Away"" is, if nothing else, an example of how one great performance can almost lift a so-so film. In this case, the great performance is turned in by Tom Hanks, and it's a dandy.
Hanks plays Chuck Noland, a Federal Express employee who's obsessed with time. We inhabit Noland's go-go world for a time, starting with one terrific sequence in which he's trying to sell Russians on the virtues of being on time - no mean feat with Russians.
We meet his girlfriend (Helen Hunt), a sweet woman who has to compete with Noland's job for affection (she gives him a conductor's pocket watch for Christmas, and he says he'll always keep it on home time).
All of this changes when Noland hops a Federal Express plane for a business trip to the South Pacific. The flight gets lost, then the plane is forced to ditch in the Pacific. After fighting to escape the burning, sinking plane, and struggling to survive in typhoon-racked seas, Noland finds himself stranded on a deserted, hardscrapple island. He instinctively reaches for his pager...and it's dead.
Suddenly, the man who is ruled by the clock has nothing but time. Hanks' transformation from helpless castaway to hardened survivor (and back to a civilized man after he's rescued) is alternately funny, sad, triumphant, and downbeat. He can say more with a facial expression, or body movement, than most actors can with brilliant dialogue.
The sequences in which Hanks tries to survive on the desert island are by far the strongest pieces of ""Cast Away,"" and taken alone, they're brilliant. Unfortunately, the bookends of the castaway story - the time before Noland is stranded and after he is rescued - don't even begin to approach the power of the island sequences.
For starters, once Noland's rescued, he wants above all to see his old girlfriend; unfortunately, in the intervening years, she has written him off for dead (as she should have), and she's married with kids. Director Robert Zemeckis - no stranger to schmaltzy relationships - toys with the audience briefly by suggesting they might get back together, but the mere idea of it is beyond silly, and thankfully, it's never consummated. The two characters are not the same two people who existed before Nolan was lost, after all.
But the mere idea of these two reuniting is so silly to begin with that Zemeckis is foolish for even entertaining it. Better to have cut that one off at the root, and had Noland start his journey of rediscovery. I also wish that Hunt would have been given more of a character to work with; she's basically stuck in a ""loving housewife"" mode, but we don't know what makes her tick, and I didn't see many sparks between her and Hanks.
Like all Zemeckis' movies, ""Cast Away"" is technically brilliant, but the island sequences challenge Zemeckis' usual hyperactive visual style; after all, how do you do ""Back To The Future"" camera moves on a desert island? Zemeckis compensates by adding other sensory stimulation - namely, sound - to the largely static camera shots to give us a kinetic sense of place.
Overall, ""Cast Away"" is very much worth seeing, if for nothing else than Hanks' brilliant performance and the raw power of the desert island scenes. It's too bad that these pieces didn't make a better whole.",1000080000,3,3251,4.807142857142857

1285718,2,B00003CXRO,"The trailer of this film does more of a job spoiling the film than any review could do, so if you've seen that, there's going to be little to surprise you in the film's  2 1/2 hour running time.
The main thing missing here would be a realistic resolution of the relationship between Hunt & Hanks characters (we're told she's been through a lot of pain, but we don't really see it... there would be wounds on both sides caused by the idealizations of each other that are completely ignored). The whole film is really a setup for Hanks' return to society, but that's the part of the film that gets least developed. Instead, we get Tom Hanks as a Boy Scout becoming one with nature (culminating in a truly embarassing moment in which a whale swims up to Hanks and winks at him.)
During his stint on the island, Hanks implausibly talks to Wilson, a volleyball. This might sound refresingly quirky, but for me it was awful (at the very least the moment where Hanks snaps & talks to him the 1st time was unbelievable). The film never really explores any of the psychological issues that a man that does such things must surely have.
The first 20 minutes of the film were awful, with Tom Hanks being the prototypical idealized American (bringing Elvis to the Russians, saving them from their own inefficiency, etc..) The casting of Tom Hanks appears to be the film's major characterization. The guy's obsessed with time, and loves his fianc, but what else do we know about him? We're expected to assume he's an everyman solely by the typecasting of Hanks.
Those are all pretty major concerns in my book... I didn't HATE it, but it's hardly a success. I think that Cast Away spends roughly half its time off the island. It would be nice if the film actually created a believeable set of developed characters for Hanks to interact with when he was off the island. I don't
think there are any decent characters in the film.
What *did* work for me was the decent direction, and the basic narrative. There's something inherently compelling about the situation, even if the movie screwed up on the specifics... I guess my basic complaint is that I've seen Fearless & The Sweet Hereafter, etc... , which deal with this sort of thing in a much better, more realistic manner. A traumatic event like this has wide-ranging emotional effects. Those interest me a lot more than how someone opens a coconut with a rock.",1000080000,,2398,4.602803738317757

I had sworn I would go ahead and watch whatever Tom Hanks did after Saving Private Ryan, but I just had no interest in this one. The first time I watched it, I really didn't like it. Every since then, it kind of stuck, until I watched it again, and then I sensed what I had missed. The story is very basic, there are no real thrills, and everything unfolds as expected. This one plays on your expectations, by making you watch all the things you would really rather not have to see. It was very emotional for me to watch, I definitely did not want to see some of the things he would have to face, and the emotional rollercoaster he was going through. Any other actor and director would have over done this, and Hanks has that bland look for the whole second half of the movie, which forced me to actually think about what he was experiencing. It kills you at the end, by not coming through with the goods, and kind of leaving you stranded on your own island with all the endless possibilities ahead. This is one that I can watch a few times, and probably never plumb the depths of what it means. Or else it meant nothing, and was just a slow paced movie, that kind of trails off at the end. My suggestion is to let yourself get into the movie, and go with the emotions. It's most notable for what isn't said, and the most intense parts of the movie where there's no dialogue.

1285785,3,B00003CXRO,"I am reminded of another Tom Hanks movie, ""That Thing you Do"". In it the rock band choses to call itself the Oneders instead of the Wonders. Why is this movie called Cast Away instead of Castaway? Is this supposed to center the focus of the film where his girlfriend seems to cast him away? I thought this film was about the middle where he is a castaway on an island. Why go with such a deep title? It makes me think too much. I enjoyed Cast Away the first time out. I have friend at work who saw Cast Away the same weekend I did and he told me he walked out of the movie and got his money back after the first half hour! I thought he was an idiot because having seen the whole movie it was pretty good overall. I am no longer so sure he is so dumb, but he did miss most of the entertaining part of the film. Castaway is very engaging after the plane crashes as Chuck Noland (Hanks) must strategise for his survival and rescue. From the film's outset Hanks character is established as hard core dedicated to Federal Express and his customers. It is kind of sweet to see how he remains consistant to that trait even when he is alone on an island. He endures many painful hardships that will have you wincing and covering your eyes at times. It makes you very happy when he finally has a little victory. His relationship with Wilson the volleyball is a memorable touch. Tom Hanks performs his heart out as usual. Castaway takes a long time to get going. Before he becomes stranded the film needs to establish Hanks is dedicated to his job, has a girlfriend he hopes to marry, and has the beginnings of a toothache. Unfortunately it meanders by including an arguably unnecessary sub-story about a package from an anonymous customer and a friend who's wife has cancer. This could have all been much briefer as so much of it was mundane. I am a true believer that no good film can be too long and no bad film can be too short. Castaway falls somewhere in the middle. It is a good film bookended between a dragging mediocre film. After spending eighty plus minutes on the island, Noland is finally rescued there is another extended segment which includes the public national welcome home parties, a failed reunion and a wrap up of the story of the anonymous customer's package. Hanks reflects on his experience and comes up with a metaphysical conclusion that he must just ""be"" which is neither inpiring or particularly insightful. The film is deeply flawed by continuing the films stay well beyond its welcome point. But of course Tom Hanks plays a character who is easy to care about making the film still worthy of a lackluster recommend. Like the newest Notting Hill super collector's DVD which has six hours of bonus material, Castaway contains more than I ever want to know about the movie. No less than five featurettes, including Hank's interview with Charlie Rose, Artwork, storyboards and commercials and trailers for the film. Plus a full length commentary by Director Robert Zemekis and crew. If you love Castaway you will certainly love this disc. If my review were only about the time spent stranded on the island I would be happy to give this film a stronger grade.

1285789,5,B00003CXRO,"Do you ever dream of being trapped on a desert island with someone you love? How about escaping to one by yourself? Do you dream of walking on beaches and digging your toes in the sand. Well, don't wish for it if you are on a plane over the ocean. Do you wonder what it would take to survive? Would you go insane being all by yourself or would you enjoy the solitude?

While some say this movie was too long and tested their patience level, it is a journey all on its own into the mind of a survivor. Is there an actor out there who can compare to Tom Hanks? I would rather watch Tom Hanks drink coconut milk for hours than to have to endure some of the acting we have to watch in other movies. Tom becomes his character to such an extent I was a bit worried I would forget I was watching Tom Hanks! His transformation from the time-obsessed Fed Ex Chuck No""land"" to the primal ""land""locked survivor blew my mind.

At first the movie was slower, then the intensity of Chuck Noland almost scared me. He was obsessed with staying on time and I just wanted to say: ""Buddy, take a vacation."" Well, I guess he did. ;> This movie has all the elements of great storytelling and adventure.

First Noland gets thrown into a completely opposite situation that what he is used to. He is no longer in control and must deal with the elements and learn to be one with nature. Not only does Survivor Noland make creative use of the contents of packages that wash up on the beach, he has to decide he is going to live to see his girlfriend (Helen Hunt, who was perfect for the role). Hope, creativity, perseverance and basic survival instincts keep him alive.

Chuck is a man who can't sit still for 10 minutes and now he has to make friends with years of solitude and a volleyball (very funny look on his face when he is trying to create fire and the volleyball is hanging out watching him). Did I get bored? No way....although, I kept thinking a shark was going to appear at some point. The spear fishing was pretty cool especially when he is out fishing from his raft in the open water. Tom does some hilarious things. I was laughing out loud so many times during the ""silent"" times. Really, he does talk during the times everyone says he is so silent, it is just a monologue and not dialogue. You almost feel you are on the island yourself. I became that absorbed at some points. He makes very creative use out of ice skates (axe) and a dress (fishing net). There are subtle messages throughout the movie I was picking up on. Like when he takes off his watch right before the plane crashes. It is symbolic of him leaving his hurried world.

This was a very thoughtful movie. You get to imagine what Tom is thinking and also when you watch it at home, you can talk about various aspects, like...what would you do? The aspect of ""character"" was very prevalent. If you watched this movie in the theatres, you might have missed out on a great movie experience. I say this because half the fun of this movie is talking about it while you are watching it. Normally it is like pulling teeth to get my husband to watch a movie with me at home and I can rarely get him to take me to a movie. Most of the time it is because of a lack of selection and movie content we are not interested in. This was different.

Not only does this movie have romance (for me), it had great ""real man"" adventure for him. There are parts in this movie that will just make you laugh out loud. It is our 6th anniversary and my husband actually watched this entire movie with me. We were totally intrigued, discussed all sorts of things as the movie progressed and really had a great time watching this movie. You will not be casting away any time watching this movie. You will be giving yourself the gift of escape.

The ending encourages you to use your imagination, but everyone can guess what will happen. An exotic location, gorgeous cinematography and a must for the unrushed viewer.

This is a 2-disc set loaded with extras, but how good are they? 20th Century Fox puts out some of the best DVD releases around, and this is no exception. The running commentary is by 5 or 6 people, including director Robert Zemeckis, but it is dominated by discussion on sound effects, followed only by visual effects. I found this to be very enlightening, but it started to get repetitive toward the end of the film. I mean, there are only so many ways to say how wind and water sounds replaced music in the film. I was also disappointed that other topics weren't discussed. Fortunately, all of the featurettes included on the 2nd disc take care of the commentary's missing information. In hindsight, it actually seems like careful planning on Fox's part as there is a document for almost every aspect of the production. There is a featurette describing the island location, one describing the story of Wilson, small snippets on visual effects, Charlie Rose's interview with Tom Hanks describing his experiences, and a documentary about the research done for surviving on a deserted island.

Who else could carry that much time alone on the screen with nothing to talk to but a volleyball- put in for that very reason.  I enjoyed watching the interpretation of the challenges he would face on a deserted island and how he survived.  I was a little disappointed with how they brought him back- there was such a struggle to survive- only to be shoved in a hotel room with seafood on the table, loved that irony.  I did not like what happens with Hunt's char. Kelly and Hanks' char. upon his return.  I felt that if I had been in Kelly's position I would have fought harder to be with the man that she called 'the love of her life.'  I don't just want a 'feel good' ending but I am not sure that they made the right call with that relationship.  I know that if I had the oppurtunity to be with the love of my life after thinking he was dead I would have wanted nothing more than to be with him and everything else would have worked out around that.  But then again- she is a mom... So much for coming home- only to be alone again.  He had to face the challenge of re-entering society and after 4 years alone that is also difficult, I liked the scenes where they showed him readjusting to life with 'conviences.'

In the beginning, it's a little tough to buy Hanks as an driven, time-obsessed, Type-A personality businessman, but he comes across well as a modern Everyman surviving on a desert island. There is a good deal of humor and a number of ""Cool Idea!"" moments. The ending deals with his return to civilization. Kudos for trying to show this readjustment, but the attempt to show CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT is heavy-handed and his situation on returning strikes me as unrealistic: Where are his friends and family?
A good try, but a bit overambitious. There is a lot to be learned from a plain ""stranded on a desert island"" movie; no point is weighing it down with too much setup and conclusion.",997920000,2,807,4.611111111111111

The storyline was also strong through the early and middle parts of the movie. Some truly great moments of drama and human insight.
But the ending gave me the impression that they didn't really know how to wrap up the movie.

1285882,4,B00003CXRO,"From such established literary classics as ""Robinson Crusoe"" and ""Lord of the Flies"" to such products of pop culture idiocy as ""Gilligan's Island"" and the original ""Survivor,"" the human imagination has been fired up by tales of ordinary folk being suddenly stranded on a deserted island and forced to survive by sheer wit, ingenuity and the unquenchable human instinct for self-preservation.  Perhaps, those of us who have been softened by all the amenities we have come to rely on to get us through our daily lives wonder if we, ourselves, could rise to such a challenge.  Whatever the underlying motivation, the lure of the theme is primal and seemingly universal, as evidenced by the recent popular successes of both TV's ""Survivor"" and the latest movie opus from Robert Zemeckis, ""Cast Away.""
""Cast Away"" is a film that works on several different levels at once - but surely the most impressive is the sheer physicality of the undertaking.  This extends not only to its setting but the fact that Tom Hanks, during the course of the filming, underwent a change in physique matched only by Robert De Niro in ""Raging Bull.""  Even more impressive is that Hanks delivers a tour de force performance, portraying a character who, for vast stretches of the film's running time, speaks nary a word and, hence, must convey his thoughts and feelings almost entirely through facial expressions and bodily gestures.
The story is a simple one:  Chuck Noland is a classic type-A FedEx exec (one wonders what tidy sum the company forked over for the benefit of this product tie-in to end all product tie-ins) who is clearly too focused on the split-second requirements of his hectic job to stop and smell the roses - or to formally propose marriage to his girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt).  When his company plane crashes into the Pacific Ocean, Chuck, as the sole survivor, manages to wash up on a deserted island and is forced to make it on his own in this strange, forbidding world.  Zemeckis and Hanks do a remarkable job making Chuck's predicament and his reaction to it believable and fascinating.  We watch the step-by-step process by which Chuck attempts to bring order to his strange new existence - and the equally intriguing ways in which he attempts to cope with the mounting loneliness and solitude that will face him in the coming years if he is not rescued.
""Cast Away"" is filled with moments of surprising warmth and emotionality.  The personal relationship Chuck establishes with a volleyball he names Wilson achieves a strange meaning and depth since it speaks to the great need we all have for companionship and love - even if we have to invest human traits into an inanimate object to get them (children, of course, do this all the time with their stuffed animals or imaginary playmates).  The finale of the film rings true as well, for we know that, in our lives, fate often intervenes in ways we do not expect and that time truly does not stand still for any of us.  The world marches on and, if, for any reason, we fall off temporarily, all we can do is to jump back on and try to catch up, painful as that may be at times.
As it is, ""Cast Away"" is gripping, moving and fascinating to watch and it is a worthy entry in a genre that seems never to lose its hold on our imaginations.",997315200,2,3290,4.684575389948007
1285961,5,B00003CXRO,"I'm a fan of the whole ""cast away from society, forced to survive without technology"" theme of this movie. The acting by Tom Hanks is top-notch. It's interesting to watch his character develop throughout the movie, and the fact that he has few dialog lines through the main part is also interesting, and makes him focus the acting much more since he can't define the character through his words. The DVD extras are also awesome, and provide a good watching experience.",997228800,,468,4.790123456790123
1285962,3,B00003CXRO,"Wilson was very funny, and smart. I think, maybe, they were setting themselves up for a sequal, but what the hell could they do? I can't say how it should have ended, but I guess the message is, 'tomorrow is another day. Thanks,...",997228800,,231,4.395348837209302
1285963,4,B00003CXRO,"This film is unquestionably worth seeing for Tom Hanks' amazing performance as Chuck Noland, a time-obsessed, globe-trotting Federal Express executive whose world is shattered when a plane crash strands him alone on a desert island somewhere in the Pacific. The middle part of the movie, chronicling Noland's struggle for survival and sanity on the lonely outpost, is far and away the most effective portion, not the least because of Hanks' startling physical transformation from a doughy, somewhat overweight landlubber to a lean, tanned survivor.
It is also effective because there is very little or no dialogue in this part, and therein lies the problem with the rest of the film. Too often the rest of the script is content with banalities and cliches that sink rather than buoy up the inherent drama in the situations; Helen Hunt, as Hanks' patient fiance, has the worst time of it, particularly in the last portion, after our hero is unexpectedly rescued and must cope with the shock of re-entry into the land of the living. The action here is hurried and superficially treated as well, calling for a separate film to make a truly moving effect. Still, one can applaud ""Cast Away"" for a fairly realistic depiction of the grim realities of a man struggling against nature, and for its refusal to settle for a pat happy ending.",997142400,2,1331,4.92
1285964,5,B00003CXRO,"Simply put, this film will go down as a classic.  Tom Hanks did an excellent job as Chuck Noland in this film.  From a very real plane crash to life on the island and back again, he is able to catch the viewer from the beginning and take them on this journey.  Not only is it an exhaustive journey on a deserted island but it takes you on Chuck's journey to step back and take another look at his life.
How many of us are caught up in the rush of the day.  Most of us are controlled by the ""clock"".  It runs our day and that is the routine that we get stuck in.  This movie shows that we have to stop and take a look around us and see what really is happening.  We need to evaluate our lives from a different perspective.  That may mean getting away from your current situation.  This film does just that via Chuck Noland.
The other wonderful thing about this movie is the ending.  When Chuck returns home, his girlfriend is now married and instead of having Chuck reunite with her in a romantic way, the movie puts it the way it should be.  She needs to get on with her life without him and he will go his seperate way and find a different path in life to take.

Really I would encourage you to rent and or buy this DVD/video. But I gave this movie only two stars based on hype vs. delivery. I read Robinson Crusoe in elementary and again in middle school. Rather than giving the feeling of being on the island with Tom Hanks and suffering through his trails as was the case with the book of similar plot, I felt like I was just watching Hanks go through the motions. Too much symbolism which never reveals itself to the viewing audience. Another thing that annoyed my was how Hanks, after being on that Island for 4 years, just immediately assumes his place in modern society chatting with his friends as if nothing had happened. In real life hanks would be a completely different person who could not relate to any0one for some time as has been the case with real life similar situations.

I thought the film had a great deal of unexplored potential.  It is more than obvious this movie was greenlit on the coat-tail success of the Survivor series and with Hanks in the lead was guaranteed a wide audience.  Hanks is popular with all age groups from teens to those over 50 years of age.  I went to see this film in the Tampa area and at least half of the patrons at my particular, late night showing, were at least 50 years young or more.  Ironically, durning the showing I attended, at least half of the patrons in the theater packed their stuff and walked out of this film a little more than halfway through. Most of my friends were disappointed inthe film.  Numerous members of my family around the stated walked out of it or simply shut the movie off after renting it.  Demographics aside the film goes sour about 20 minutes into it and for about an hour and fifteen minutes throught the middle and from there it doesn't sweeten.  I did not appreciate the ending because true love will endure no matter what! End of story.  I do agree with some of the other reviews you have posted in that this film has no gratuitous sex, graphic violence or bowl churning humor.  This is rare in deed for todays Hollywood!  Unfortuneately this film in my opinion turned out to be nothing more than a boring advertisment for Federal Express and soccor equipment...WILLLLSONNNN!!!",996624000,,1565,4.475352112676056

Anyway, I quite liked ""Cast Away"", despite a slightly slow third act.  Tom Hanks plays a FedEx employee who happens to get stuck on an island, all by himself and with barely anything to survive with.  What surprises me about the film is it's usage of elements such as a musical score (virtually nonexistent for 2/3 of the film), sound effects (the ""score"" for most of the film), and even photography that have to explain a lot in a film like this.  Even though it is a good film with some good performances, it is marred by a slow third act, but is definitely a commendable effort.  The DVD boasts a few documentaries on the island itself, survival techniques, and one on Wilson, the volleyball.  It also includes a 45-minute interview with Tom Hanks on not just ""Cast Away"", but on some of his previous efforts (including the upcoming HBO miniseries ""Band of Brothers"").  Plus, there's some visual effect sequences broken down for your amusement, and the trailers, TV ads, and a nicely hidden Easter Egg that may answer one of the movie's more intruging questions.

1285970,3,B00003CXRO,"""Castaway"" simply has no repeat viewing value. Tom Hanks does very well in a difficult role, and the movie handles the ancillary aspects of a long-term disappears ably, but this is a movie that is really only good the first time you see it.
What more can I say without ruining it? The direction is very good and the movie is not burdened by uneccesary musical scores or hammy special effects. Everythign is shot in a very documentary style and the few special effects are all used only to advance the story, so the direction is good.
Tom Hanks turns in his usual materful textured performance, and Helen Hunt takes a welcome departure from the ""strong woman"" role into someone more like the rest of us. The film's ability to deal with very ordinary people is really where it is at its best. I enjoyed it, but I won't watch it again",996451200,,831,4.473684210526316

What this film represents most is the tremendous lost opportunity that was suggested in the beginning......the cinematography and dialogue in the initial scenes and even those on the island were excellent at times, but the remainder of the film was a total dud.  NOTHING got developed or enhanced or explained in the second half, as though Tom Hanks and the others who directed it simply fell asleep or got bored, OR ran out of ideas.....

1286058,4,B00003CXRO,"I resisted seeing Cast Away for months. I heard that for most of the movie, the only onscreen action was Tom Hanks. On an island. Alone. No snappy dialogue, no car chases through San Francisco. No ostensible villains. What kind of decent film is that? An excellent one! I was so wrong not to see this earlier. Tom Hanks is riveting in an Oscar-worthy performance. Hanks is Chuck Nolan, a Type-A Fed Ex manager whose life is run by the minute hand. At one point, he even shouts ""Tick Tock! Tick Tock!"" at a lethargic Fed-Ex'er. When the Fed Ex plane he's riding on crashes in the Pacific, he gets his toughest assignment ever, forced to discover his real resources. It's fascinating to see what happens to a man who was once defined by the shortness of time, suddenly forced to grapple with more idle time than anyone could want. The ensuing battle of wit and survival held my attention completely (contrary to my expectations). The only reason I didn't give this movie 5 stars is that the ending seemed a little rushed.
The promos, part of the DVD bonus disc, ask, ""What happens when everything you are is taken away?"" Another take on this movie is that almost all of us will sooner or later be in a situation where we feel that this is indeed the case ... loss of a relationship, job, health, etc. can lead to the encroaching sense of isolation and despair we see Nolan fighting. The movie is inspirational in showing how strong the human spirit can be.
There are also fine performances by Helen Hunt and Chris Noth (Sex And The City's Mr. Big!)
The bonus disc is terrific. It will answer just about every question you have about the movie's behind-the-scenes. It even includes interviews with the very interesting ""primitive technology"" experts consulted during the movie's production.",996364800,4,1787,4.6761904761904765

The movie begins with Chuck Noland (Hanks) going to Moscow to teach the FedEx way to the Russians.  He leaves his girlfriend Helen Hunt (Twister, As Good as it Gets) with a promise to return for New Year's.  It will be four years before he sees her again.
After surviving a plane crash the movie follows Hanks attempts to cope with life alone.  He befriends a volley ball, whose death is perhaps the only time I have cried over an inanimate object in a movie.  But that shows you how wrapped up you become in the film without realizing it.
Although the film is just under two and a half hours it goes by quickly.
Collateral material is excellent.  This is the kind of information I really like to see.  Director Robert Zemeckis  (Forrest Gump, Romancing the Stone) tells the story of the ""real"" Wilson, a volleyball that floated to shore as he was researching the movie.

I think that the main problem, lack of direction or closure.  The first half of the movie was great, but I agree with other reviews that a cut away from the island between ""I have made fire"" and the next section of the movie would have helped the pacing a bit, and the cut wouldn't have been as abrupt.
As for the ending.... ah, what can I say.  This will likely go down in history as being among the worst endings in the history of film, and takes the movie down to the 2 star rating.  I can understand the reasoning behind the ending, which is basically to let the audience draw their own conclusion, but we don't need to be beat on the head with a metaphor to get it.  In addition, based on Tom Hank's performance, the audience gets attached to his character, and likely wants to see some closure... and without giving away too much more of an entertaining but disappointing movie, the end of the movie left most everyone I've talked to about it with a big cartoon question-mark above their heads.

While I liked the main theme of the story I was very disappointed by the ""post rescue"" part of the plot and found it weak and undeveloped. I simply could not accept as plausible the fact that his girlfriend could turn her back on ""the love of her life"" only a year after he disappeared and married someone else. - It actually made me quite angry and the end.

1286195,5,B00003CXRO,"I really enjoyed this movie. At the beginning of the movie you're shown the type of person Tom Hanks character is. And then when he's stranded on the desert island the two people just seem totally opposite, and that's a pretty cool effect. He is a workaholic typer person living a very fast paced life one minute, and then the next he's stranded with nothing trying to survive. The performance by Tom Hanks is very very good as well. It's just him obviously, but it never gets boring. Through much of the island scenes there isn't much talking, but watching his gradual progress on the island is just captivating. Throughout his time on the island you can gradually see his sanity beginning to crack, but always he manages to hold on with his picture of the woman he loves. The caracter Wilson, appropriately named, is pretty silly in a way, but you really find watching the movie that you begin to see ""him"" as a real character and not an inanimate vollyball. The scene where Tom Hanks character loses Wilson is very good. When you look at the fact that he kicks up such a fuss over losing a vollyball it's hard to feel anything, but it's the idea that he loses his only companion, his friend for all his time on the island that is the idea there. Anyways, then he is rescued and is returned to his home. The scene with him lying on the floor in his hotel room turning the light on and off looking at the picture is absolutely beautiful. It really shows the effect that the island had on him. He's home, but yet he's still the person he was on the island. The highlight of the film however is the meeting with him and the woman he loves. The tension, confusion, anticipation, etc, is all there, and it really pulls the viewer on emotionally as well. The movie ends with Tom Hanks standing at a crossroads, and he smiles. There is still hope even though his life was stripped away.
All in all, this movie is beautiful, and very very good. It takes the viewer through so many emotions, that it's hard not to lose yourself in the film. Oh, and the scene where the plane goes down is totally intense, I almost forgot about that. Anyways, check this movie out, you definately won't be dissapointed.",995414400,3,2194,4.446650124069479

Instead of churning out another predictible car chasing, bowel movement jokes, gratuitious sex, hollywood piece of junk, Robert Zemekis has created a masterpiece.  While the idea of being stranded on an island isn't a new one, the way this one was done was simply stupendous.
The messages delivered in this movie were profound.  The sense of loss and isolation felt by Chuck Noland is apparent and well acted by Hanks.  This is a case of a director counting on a superb actor to make the story compelling.  I don't believe any other actor could have done what Hanks did here.  It takes tremendous talent to keep the audience interested when a good portion of the movie has very little dialogue and has little music.  For those that knock this movie for lacking those things, I simply say this:  If you were to be stranded on an island you will not hear music playing in the background and chances are you will have no one to talk to.  Translation: This movie deals with real life.
It's completely refreshing to see a film like this that isn't preoccupied with providing the audience what I call ""eye candy"" and instead concentrated on presenting not just a film, but an experience.",995414400,2,1251,4.706422018348624

1286198,4,B00003CXRO,"The last time Tom Hanks teamed up with director Robert Zemeckis the result was ""Forrest Gump"".  I can safely say this is no ""Forrest Gump"".  FG was a terrific story, further enhanced by outstanding acting.  This is a decent story propped up by phenomenal acting.
The initial premise was intriguing.  A Fedex employee is stranded on a deserted island and is forced to use his ingenuity to survive.  At first, it is fascinating watching Chuck (Tom Hanks) adapt to his stark environment.  However, after about an hour of screen time devoted solely to his island exploits, the film begged for a cut to somewhere else.  There were numerous themes that were running simultaneous to his island struggles.  There was the search and rescue, and Kelly's (Helen Hunt) coming to terms with his loss to mention the two most obvious themes that were completely neglected.
Instead, Zemeckis decided that we should have all Tom all the time, which despite his gargantuan talent and over the top performance, became just a bit more Tom than I could stand.  Zemeckis did a superb job with the photography and induced one of Hanks best performances.  Unfortunately, the film became one-dimensional and began to bog down.  The ending brought no relief from the drudgery, leaving viewers adrift without the emotional release necessary to bring the story to closure.
Tom Hanks was in top form.  He deservedly was nominated for yet another best actor award by the Academy (his fifth).  It seems everywhere I turn lately I see Helen Hunt.  She made four films in 2000 and I have seen them all in the last two months.  This was one of her better performances of the year, though the part was small.
The film grossed over $200 million, which shows that for most people just being able to see Tom Hanks is enough.  I rated it 7/10.  The one-dimensional story and flat ending stifled my enthusiasm despite a tour de force performance by Hanks.",995328000,2,1915,4.789634146341464

And once he returns to civilization it gets even more boring.  Finally, the ending is pathetically bad.  It's okay guys, you don't have to like every movie Tom Hanks is in.  Helen Hunt is brutal in this movie.",995328000,2,325,4.35
1286201,3,B00003CXRO,"While there is no denying that Tom Hanks is a fine, fine actor and that this movie, on some level, was moving and significant it left me with no feeling.  I walked away from the film feeling neither upset, excited, content, nor with any closure.  It failed to evoke any inner turmoil in me - and truly, isn't that what a successful piece of film should do?  Any successful piece of art?
The graphics were magnificent, and the plot could have gone somewhere, but it seemed to die somewhere on the island.  Tom Hanks returns home and... he can immediatly drive again?  Feels totally comfortable around people?  No anxiety issues about returning to work?  Realistically, I think that the writers and directors skipped what could have been the more emotionally defining portion of the film.
Almost all three stars are for Mr. Hanks' wonderful performance.",995241600,6,851,4.827586206896552
1286298,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away is the second movie Robert Zemeckis made in 2000, and it's by far his best one. The director is bringing out a lot of worthy films at the moment, and choosing to work with Tom Hanks an awful lot is the right answer to success. So, what makes Cast Away worth seeing? From the trailer, it looks like a guy gets stranded on an island, yes? Well, the movie has a deeper meaning to it - it's about not abandoning what you believe in and never giving up on hope. We've probably all heard that meaning before, but since it is only one actor playing all of it out by himself, it seems somehow more complex and detailed. Tom Hanks' performance is absolutely brilliant; his most memorable yet playing a character that has morals everyone should follow. Helen Hunt isn't in this movie much, but when Hanks and her pucker up, it's one of the most magical moments in the movie. Cast Away is adventurous, daring, sickening and beautiful, I highly recommend it.",994982400,,956,4.468571428571429
1286299,5,B00003CXRO,"Ever since 1992s ""A League of Their Own"", Tom Hanks has been on a roll.  His films have been critically acclaimed as well as hugely successful, ranging from modest (That Thing You Do! & The Green Mile) to Box Office Kings (Forrest Gump & Saving Private Ryan).  How does he do it?
Well with Cast Away, Mr. King Midas strikes Gold again, with a simple tale of a man who crash lands on an island and must survive it's hardships for four years.  Sounds simple, huh?  And you might think a movie, even with Hanks in it, about one person on an island for most of the time may seem boring.  Not a chance.  Cast Away breaks down the human being in us all and lets us discover who we truly are inside, by watching Chuck Noland (NO LAND) discover for himself what it takes to sustain his own life and well being.  The love for a woman he left behind, that he looks at with a picture in a pocket watch she gave him when last they were together.  There are layers and layers of depth to this piece that is so compelling, if you're not emotional by the end, check yourself for a pulse.
Those that love this film have already fallen in love with Wilson, a vollyball with a bloodpainted face, drawn by Chuck, to have as a companion.  Sounds nuts, you say?  Try being alone for four years and see how long it takes you to make up a friend to talk to.  Wilson represents Chuck's hopes and determination in himself.  He needs Wilson to be there.  I have never gottan more choked up over a vollyball in my entire life, but when you watch that one scene on the raft, well, your heart just breaks...and I know it's crazy because Wilson is not a real person...or is he?
Anyone who scoffs at the ending are really too busy to take the time to get the point of what Cast Away is all about.  I am so tired of these cute little endings where the guy gets the girl in the end, when in reality, we all know it doesn't always work out that way.  But you take from Cast Away what you bring to it, and that's what the ending is about.  Which direction to take now?  Not sure.  But at least ""Tomorrow the sun will rise"".
The DVD extras are FANTASTIC.  So many featurettes that don't feel like featurettes..they feel like short documentaries..and there's even one all about Wilson!  But my favorite is the Charlie Rose interview with Hanks, who is such a delight..it's truly a great interview.  I really wish he could've participated in the audio commentary, but he's so busy.  One mistake I noticed..the details on the back of the case state that Cast Away is presented in anamorphic widescreen with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which is incorrect..it's only 1.85:1.  But with tons of trailers and interviews and featurettes, it really makes little difference to me.
Grab this movie on DVD, and get ready for an experience you'll never forget.  And Mr. Hanks?  May your streak of hits never end!",994982400,7,2861,4.362948960302457

Maybe I'm just a product of the Hollywood machine and a sucker for happy endings, but I really felt let down by this movie - I had expected so much more!

1286305,1,B00003CXRO,"seems like i am in the minority on this site, or maybe all the other reviews were actually paid for or even written by studio employees...anyway, here's my ""review""...
Perect example of good idea, probably even a good treatment and I might go as far as suspecting there used to once be a good script for Cast Away.  The idea SEEMED to be:  man allows work to engulf his life, perfect employee but losing control of his personal life, man gets ""second chance"" by getting standed on a island giving him a chance to ""think about life"" and reconsider his priorities.
Like Speilberg's newest fiasco A.I., I think Zemeckis just didn't understand what he had.  I instead of making what could have been a very meaningful film, he decided to foof it up, add some tears and some smiles, make that all tears and smiles, to a point that the story doesn't really matter.
The first act is the man, Hanks, as he was.  Hard worker, busy little worker be.  But with all the Federal Express logos and pep rallies saturating the screen time, its hard to really tell what's trying to be said.  Big corporations bad?  No?  They turn you into robots though, at their becken call.  But big corporation good for us little guys who need our packages on time (since time rules our lives too, we need things FAST).  Very confusing.
The second act, man (Hanks) ""finding himself.""  I don't think this is what desolation is about.  Maybe Zemeckis should watch directors such as Antonio, Wenders, and Jarmusch who have perfected the visualization of loneliness on the big screen.  This all plays out being too goofy and rediculous.  Sure this is the ""movies"" but with a story like this SOME realism is expected!  This could have played out to be a big step for hollywood if Zemeckis did this sequence the right way.  Let the audience feel the pain of loneliness, quiet minimalism CAN be good.  Our attention spans need to be tested and the film could have drawn the viewers in so much more (therefore opening themselves up for even more Zemeckis sap).
Third act.  It's all down hill from here.  A strange love story happens.  Its all been done before.  Man loves woman.  Man dissappears, presumed dead.  Woman marries someone else (trust me, I'm not ruining anything for you).  Man comes back finds his wife with another man/family.  Man tries to get woman back.  Man denied.  Man finds new woman.  And the funniest thing about the third act is that he finds himself emerced in work as soon as he gets back to the world again.  And he seems happy doing so.  And he finds his ""new love"" how else, but by successfully delivering a federal express package to her (one of the packages that washes up on the deserted with Hanks - conveniently nothing is ever mentioned of the other packages, such as the ever so famous volleyball, that the federal express employee opened, rumaged through and used, left or ruined during his stay on the island).  Chalk up another plug for Federal Express and another strike for Zemeckis.",994550400,4,2985,4.628571428571429
1286306,5,B00003CXRO,"The theme of people and their possessions and relationships being cast away through life is woven throughout this amazing tale.  Tom Hanks transforms before your eyes as he first cast away his girl friend for another seemingly urgent business trip.  A career that cast away, or he thinks he must cast away his personal life, or forever put it on hold for another delivery.
The fate of life rips him from the seemingly urgency of everyday life and it's false priorities, and casts him away to a life where he must cast away first his worthless pager, then the things that are now worthless in his isolated deserted island life.  The seemingly worthless items that wash a shore with him prove to be of great value, like ice skates and the volleyball.  As he cast away his preconceived notions of what things are important in life, he so struggles to hang onto the hope of reconnecting with his girl friend.
Days of early survival melt into over four years as he finds his only priority in life is to just be able to breath each day, one day at a time.  Time is recorded as marks on a wall, not by the precision of watches, clocks and calendars.  The physical and emotional transformation of Tom Hanks is beyond remarkable, it is stunning.  Yet the best is saved for last.
His reunion with his old friends as he steps back into his previous life confronts him with a personal reassessment of what in life is important, not urgent, nor just wasting your life on this earth.  He first finds that his old girl friend has in one way cast him away to marry someone else, yet she has followed him as he was lost at sea and his eventual rescue in every detail.  Her heart was in some way never letting go of the hope that he might live, yet her head cast away the relationship to allow her to continue on with her life, marry and have children.  She almost wants to cast away her husband, children and her comfortable life to return to the love of her life, yet he knows in his heart that he must at last cast away his heart felt hope of someday returning and marrying her.
His hope was his life line, yet his hope now must be cast away to free himself to live the rest of his life.  He follows his heart in the closing scene to find himself faced with a decision that many of us never allow ourselves to face, that of in which new direction do I live my life.  As he stares at the four roads that each lead to four or more irreversible paths with his life, we are left wondering as he is, what life changing choice to make, and which others to cast away.  Knowing that the choice of one, casts aside all others.
Helen Hunt again proves herself as one of our great dramatic actresses.  From her look of heartfelt disappoint as he leaves for another urgent trip, to her uncomfortable feelings as she again reconnects with her lost love.  Tom Hanks rises above and beyond acting as he becomes the man who must chose to live or to die with each of life's choices.  He faces the pain of isolation by sharing himself with Wilson his imaginary friend.
Technically the movie on DVD is spectacular, with the special effects adding the visual impact that the writers envisioned in their imagination.
You do not leave the movie when it ends, you yourself begin to examine each time consuming part of your life. Things, jobs and relationships and wonder what should I keep and what should I cast away.",994550400,7,3380,4.392628205128205

Tom Hanks gives one of his most commendable performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex system engineer whose plane crashes somewhere over the South Pacific, near an isolated island that's twice the size of Texas.

A pretty in-your-face action epic adventure which will be appreciated by all age groups above teenagers (inclusive). For those who seek the new Robinson Crusoe journey on DVD will relish this exquisite work of art by Robert Zemeckis. Starring Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt, this movie has the smallest cast ever, I think, since most of the movie focuses on Tom Hanks. Apart from that, there are only about 5 other characters.

It is sad that everyone else in this movie is really weak . what does it say when the 2nd best performance in a movie is done by a volleyball,994550400,,366,3.9594594594594597

I could have written this storyline, and I'm no professional writer.  The time spent on the island was OK, but I kept on looking for more.  Once off the island, the movie really drags.  It could have been easily shortened up by at least 20 minutes with no loss whatsoever.  The film ends abruptly, as if they didn't know how to really finish it.  This movie badly needs more suspense, more action.  As it is, it will appeal only to the diehard Tom Hanks follower.",994377600,,588,4.2342342342342345

Although the film was beautifully made with some fantastic shots on the island, there are few times that I have been more bored.
If you do watch it, be prepared for an hour of minimal dialogue. There is a well acted scene by Tom Hanks where he gets very excited about the fire he builds.  The rest of the dialogue is with Wilson the volleyball.  There was a moment that held my interest briefly when he casted Wilson away after realizing his situation in talking with a volleyball but soon retrieves it.  ""Wake me when he's off the island,"" is what some of you may say.
The third act doesn't get much better.  I almost quit watching it but thought that it may redeem itself with a cool ending....",994377600,3,700,4.361538461538461
1286410,4,B00003CXRO,"I like this movie, it's OK. I don't plan on watching it often as it will most likely get tired fast. But when I want to see a sample of some very, VERY good acting, then this is where I'll go.
Tom Hanks does a great job. Those vacant looks, anger, frustration, excitment, they are all very convincing. The slimed down version of Mr. Hanks after 4 years on the island is a pretty stunning transformation. And talk about a beard or bad hair day. WOW!
I can see where this movie is not going to be very popular as there is not a lot of action, special effects, or even sound track. It's very minimal in nature. If one watches the special features on the second disk, then the point of the movie will be very clear. There are many additional features on the 2nd disk, most of which could be lived without (""Life and Death of a Hollywood Extra"" for example).
If I may, try these when you listen/watch this movie. Notice that there is no music or 20th century sound on the island. Listen hard for it, it's really relaxing in a way. You'll notice that it's very hard to listen to the nothingness of the film. Then make sure to listen hard after the return. There are some great points being made. Pay special attention to the Elvis selections that appear during the movie. Very interesting choices. Finally, watch Mr. Hanks' eyes. There lies the story, and amazingly so.
You'll enjoy this movie at home, especially with a home theater or quality stereo surround sound stereo. Don't watch it often, as the ""I'm tired of it"" syndrome will develop quickly. Bravo to Mr. Hanks and the crew in making the film. Lastly, do not watch this film if you're going somewhere on a plane a few days after seeing it.....",994291200,,1698,4.410828025477707
1286411,5,B00003CXRO,"I love a movie that challenges me as a viewer and this movie definitely did that. The non-dialog, non-soundtrack portion of the film is original and different and challenging. I have decided I loved the uniqueness because they weren't there just to stretch but as storytelling techniques. I left my initial viewing not knowing for sure how I felt about it. During the film I was intensly interested in Tom Hanks and his performance as well as what his character's next step would be. So, when watching the DVD, seeing the film for the second time, I was just as involved in the tale. In addition to the excellent film this DVD included the kinds of things we are growing to not only love but expect from DVDs. The ""how it was done"" feature was great as was the vollyball feature and I just loved the Charlie Rose/Hanks interview. Anytime Hanks or Bob Zemmekes (spelling?) has something to say about the film I was facinated. I loved both discs in the two disc set and I know that from time to time I will pull out this gem and enjoy it all over again.",994291200,,1051,4.422680412371134
1286412,4,B00003CXRO,"""Cast Away"" is the embodiment of a frequent fantasy of many people to be stranded on a deserted island.  Great concept for a movie, and Tom Hanks was perfectly cast as the cast away.  I doubt that any other actor could have carried the movie - which mostly consists of  just Hanks on the island - so well.  The movie starts with the premise that Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, is a Federal Express executive obsessed with time.  A little obvious but still a nice contrast with his life on the island where time becomes meaningless.  Also, since he's on a Federal Express plane that goes down, several parcels are washed up which provide Chuck with a variety of items he can use try to use in his effort to survive.  By the way, the scenes from the plane crash are particularly well done and seemed very realistic to me (never having been in a plane crash, I can't speak with absolute authority on that).  I can't say enough about how good Hanks' performance was .  Personally, I thought the ending didn't live up to the rest of the movie.  I would have liked to see a little more of his transition back into a world that changed drastically during his absence.  Be sure to watch the ""Making of Cast Away"" on the DVD.  The story of filming the movie is almost as interesting as the movie itself.",994204800,,1295,4.417721518987341
1286413,5,B00003CXRO,"I loved CAST AWAY. It's a facinating film about one man (Tom Hanks) leaving his home to go on a plane only to find himself stranded on a deserted island for four years. From beginning 'til the end, you are engrossed to discovering what happpens to Hanks' character. I loved every moment of this film, and Hanks definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Actor. I mean, what's so great about Russell Crowe?! I didn't even really like GLADIATOR all that much. Also, the special effects in this film are just specatular and the storyline is solid and strong. I don't know why but for some reason this film reminds me of THE PERFECT STORM (maybe it's because both have to do with disasters at sea). But this is one film I definitely recommend. I didn't catch it in the theaters, unfortunately. But I watched it on VHS and thought it was just as superb! A must-see.",994204800,,856,4.493589743589744
1286414,4,B00003CXRO,"This is one of a very few movies where physical transformation of the main actor is very visible during the course of the movie. For the first half-an-hour or so, the beer-belly Tom Hanks is difficult to go unnoticed. Yet, after he has supposedly spent few years on a deserted island, Hanks emerges thin, tanned and ""fat-free"", just like your best archetype of a survivor. One must admire the lengths to which Tom Hanks have gone in order to prepare for this role. Otherwise, the film itself is what you would expect it to be: a modern Robinson Crusoe story with the necessary effects, casting and quality of a good movie. Yes, it could have been better, but it's still worth seeing. If you are fond of Tom Hanks, you will want to have this one in your DVD library!",994204800,,765,4.4714285714285715
1286415,4,B00003CXRO,"A Fed-Ex workaholic, recently engaged, is the sole survivor of a plane crash and survives on an uninhabited island for four years. This movie, like almost all of today's films, was poorly sold. In the space of a sixty second commercial, not only did they tell you all of the above info-admittedly this is a simple story-they also took out all of the suspense of the movie by spilling the beans about the 3rd Act and the fact that he gets rescued. All that's left to discover is the last 20 minutes. We don't know much about Hanks' character beside the fact that he's a workaholic, and that his life is dictated by the Clock. And this is where the film falls short. By not knowing what kind of man this is, or even what he thinks he is, there is nothing to discover about his transformation,of which there is very little, other than the physical. Sure there is the isolation and the depression to witness and the creation of fire and the finding of food and shelter, but there is a larger protrait missing here. It's the difference between a good film and a great film. Hanks is very, very good here, but without a truely full dimensional character to play, it's Hanks we see on the island, not Chuck Noland. Noland is more of a statistic than a character. An actress of Helen Hunt's stature, and talent, is badly needed because we can plug in bits of her other characterizations into the story to keep her presence alive. Robert Zmeckis is a good director for entertainment films, and he's got taste and class, but this film needed an artist, which Zmeckis is not. And like his other big film FORREST GUMP, you're not sure what,if anything, he's trying to say. Zmeckis is a very external director, so it's no wonder many, many people didn't get the last scene of this film. It feels like a different, and more talented director helmed this scene. It's completely at odds stylistically with the rest of the film. Like the director started using a different film language, is the best way I can explain it. No wonder many people didn't get it. It's more in the style of older foreign language films. I think it's the best scene in the film, and I wish Zmeckis had started filming this movie after shooting this scene instead of the other way 'round....As for the DVD, the DTS sound is superb and the extras at times, do a better job of defining the movie's intentions, than the film itself.",994118400,,2388,4.5046082949308754
1286535,3,B00003CXRO,"That sad thing is that the only part of this movie I remember clearly and that had more to it than the scenes I saw in the TV spots was that incredible plane crash sequence.
I still have nightmares about that sequence.  But then, this movie has me seeing the FedEx logo in my sleep.  Zemeckis is brilliant with this kind of high-tech, meticulous filmmaking process where thousands of things happen at once and are clearly memorable in the process after the movie is over and down the street at the coffee shop after the credits have faded.  However, I only distinctly remember three moments in the movie after that...Tom Hanks in Short Beard.  Tom Hanks in Long Beard with Soccer Ball.  Tom Hanks at home without soccer ball, but pining for Helen Hunt...not the ball.  There were some things that I latch onto with some thought... like making fire, stealing the shoes off a corpse, asking the professor how the radio could work after three years on the island....but that might be a sleep bleed-through from TV Land.
Sorry to say, I just didn't like it.  When I say that I know there was a tremendous amount of work that went into it and a lot of money and time and talent...but you'd think through all that I'd remember something more than I do.

Tom Hanks' performance is amazing, and in a role where the lead actor must carry the movie for an hour while only talking to a volleyball, he is great. I also like this movie for the way the special effects are used. Watch the extras on the second DVD to find out. I prefer special effects that help tell the story, such as this or something like Terminator 2, where the menace of the T-1000 needs the special effects to come to fruition. It clearly shows up movies such as The Phantom Menace, where the special effects are the story. And they made for a bad story.

Helen Hunt appears, disappears for four years, then returns, and we have NO idea what happened to her in between.  3.  The acting is more humorous than serious or dramatic.

1286541,4,B00003CXRO,"A simple premise unravels itself to an extraordinary understanding of the human things surrounding us. I believe that the secret to Tom Hank's character's survival should not have been given away in the ads by Fox. Movies I really want to see, I avoid all ads for and I did for this one too. I don't want to be told what I am going to get. I want to be tugged with emotion in all its intensity and fashion. such a beautiful film in its essence, the story of a Chuck Nolan who gets stranded on an island with the hope of seeing his fiance again. SPOILER WARNING: But Alas the anti climactic ending was a heartbreaking tearjerker. The very woman that kept Chuck alive should have in some way been worth it. She still loves him but it is too late. While the idea about changes and the motto ...to keep breathing shines but it doesn't make the viewer's heart feel any better because of what happened between Tom Hanks and Helen Hunts characters. A simple story very visually told and a performance worth the nomination it got, the movie winds slowly to  unravel its sincerity. It could be mistaken as slow but the slowness is vital to its very structure. When Hanks got his nomination, I thought again, another year, something is wrong with the academy. This guy gets chosen every year..but every year this man brings incredibly fantastic performances.

I didn't have great expectations for this film.  When a movie is really good, it exceeds those expectations.  This one did not.
Basically, the movie is about one and a half hours too long.  The one and a half hours that are too long are those that take place on the island in the South Pacific.  I can't for the life of me see how a movie about a guy stranded on an island where there aren't any cannibals or wild animals craving human flesh can be exciting...and this isn't.
The movie is an absolute drag for Hanks' duration on the island.  I mean, is building a fire, taking ten minutes of film to figure out how to open a coconut, or finding a cave when there's a torrential downpour entertainment?  i didn't really think so...but I'm not a fan of the CBS show 'Surviving' either.
I knew I was in trouble when the FedEx plane crashes in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a tropical storm...rough waters...and the entire fusolage remained intact.  I like a little realism with my films.
I enjoyed the movie when he wasn't in an airplane or on an island...which is probably about thirty to forty minutes...that's good and relatively interesting.

No one would have guessed that this ""Bosom Buddies"" actor would ever turn out to be the greatest actor of our times.  Sure, Tom drifted once-and-a-while to scripts that should be better left unmentioned.  But Tom has evolved.
His movies are successful because we are comfortable with Tom in front of our eyes.  He is one of those actors that does not become type-cast or predictable.  He IS the part he plays...and we believe him and want him to be that character.  When he played Jim Lovell in Apollo 13, he was Jim Lovell.  Get my point?  We welcome Tom into our homes and into our lives because he has gives us an enormous gift every time he does another movie.
And in Cast Away, he surpasses our already high expectations with an outstanding and demanding performance.

Forrest Gump explored a complex world where he learned that making a few significant friendships and finding a true love overcome one's ostensible intelligence or the power of money or fame.
In this film Tom Hanks encounters an empty world (or island) where he learns that making a friendship with a volleyball and remember his true love can keep him alive when the loneliness is so great.
This is a fine film, with a breathtaking performance by Hanks. However, outside of Hanks rendition of his Forrest Gump character in a new world (or at least place), the film is quite empty.
Sentiments abound, and one does not feel Hanks' plight in the film.
The film excites but does not provoke. A good movie, but one that is not tolerable to view more than once or twice.  If you enjoy DVD's, then definitely get this.",993772800,,996,4.627118644067797

First is that they could of fit full screen on the second disc, secondly they could of included a little bit more interactive features. The movie is also interesting. This movie has very little talking and the beginning is a little bit boring. This is probably due to the fact that the beginning is very slow. Also because half of the movie is little or no talking, it seems as if you were watching it forever. If you only like action, don't get this movie, even though it has very excellent reviews.

The dynamic that Hanks displays throughout the movie is incredible: the definite bright spot.  But, there is not a whole lot of progression, development, or action.  For those who are looking for an exciting survival story, this is NOT your movie.  I find it odd that Hanks knew how to do everything necessary for survival.

1286664,4,B00003CXRO,"Movie Summary: Chuck Noland works for Federal Express. He kisses his fianc&eacute;e goodbye on Christmas Eve to take a flight on a Federal Express plane. He tells her he will be right back, but we all know by the title of the movie that he doesn't keep his promise. Chuck's plane goes down in bad weather and Chuck washes up on a very small island with a few Federal Express packages. He spends four years on the island with a volleyball as his only friend until the ocean washes hope up on his shore.
My Opinion:  There were three main parts to Cast Away. I liked the island part the best. It was the most intriguing and interesting. I wish there had been more to this part. I wanted to know more about how he spent those four long years. I would have liked to see him build things and deal with the solitude. The first part, although setting up the next two parts, was a little long. The last part was not as satisfying as I had hoped. Chuck remains a castaway even though there is some hope at the end. I enjoyed the movie but found it was only good, and not great.
DVD Quality:  Widescreen anamorphic 2.35:1, DD6.1 sound. A complete second disc to hold all the extras which include trailers, featurettes, and documentaries. If you want to know everything about Cast Away, now you can. This is a very good DVD release.
What You Should Do:  Buy it if you are a huge Tom Hanks fan or loved the movie in the theater. A rental should do for the rest of us.",993600000,2,1455,4.2644927536231885
1286665,4,B00003CXRO,"I was not sceptical at all when going to see this at the cinema as I have not disliked any of Tom Hank's films.
The story, while a little over the top, is quite straight forward, Hanks plays a federal express chief, who, while eating christmas dinner, has a call and has to jet off with some federal express parcels. Leaving his fiance (Helen Hunt) and telling her he'll be right back!!! Indeed!! The jet crashes in some remote area killing the few on board with the exception of Hanks! I must say that the plane crash scene is one of the finest i've every seen in a movie!!
Hanks, on a small life boat finds himself washed up on the shore of some island along with the dead remaining crew!! Hanks soon realises that there is no life on the island and not much food, he does make use of the washed up federal packages, not least making a 4 year friend with a volley ball named Wilson!! And so begins a fight for survival where he learns to catch fish make fires and even get a septic tooth out!!
Hank's performance definatley keeps the film going, and while there is hardly any musical score in the film its still entertaining stuff throughout. You can actually see in his face the will to survive, kept going by a pocket sized picture of his girl!! Another good aspect, is the impressive amount of weight that Hanks lost for the second part of the film - after being there for 4 years!!

Its this mix of drama with the action and aventure of the first part of the film that makes Cast Away a compelling watch!",993600000,,1510,4.298245614035087

1286667,4,B00003CXRO,"this is really two movies in one.  unfortunately, neither of which really comes to fruition.
the first movie is about a guy with his priorities seemingly askew (work obsessed) getting a rude awakening to what really matters.  except that this latter awakening never really happens  la *fearless*.  instead after a gripping crash scene and the learning of a lot of survival skills, the metaphysical or spiritual awakening never occurs.  which is too bad.  it's a definite and noticeable void in the film.  (the first film :)
the second film, well, that might be a spoiler if i saw too much, but needless to say it wasn't too well done either.  it could have been much more fully explored, but seems to have been cut very short and it seems like the writers (which i guess includes Hanks) were sort of searching for an ending.  and that's the way the movie plays out.
there needed to be more character development and better insights into human nature in order to really make this movie into something special.  and unfortunately it didn't happen.
that said, Hank's acting throughout is marvelous, and it is still a compelling film - as in: what would i do in such a situation? . . . it makes you think :)",993427200,2,1203,4.605633802816901

But come on, how many times did we have to see the FedEx logo???  I understand that Hanks' character works there, but they show the FedEx logo in virtually every shot for the first half hour of the movie.  Sometimes they show you 4 or 5 logos in the same shot, it's like paying to watch a commercial.  I wouldn't be surprised if they asked Hanks to wear a FedEx cap for the island scenes.",993427200,,580,4.017391304347826
1286788,4,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks delivers another exceptional and emotional performance (Don't worry I'll back that up).  The film is not perfect, but it would be silly to expect it to be.  In the first act, you are introduced to Hanks' character, Chuck Noland, a Fed Ex engineer.  We are given the idea that he is planning to ask Helen Hunt to marry him (giving her an obvious gift) but he decides to wait until he returns from his trip.  He leaves for his plane exclaiming, ""I'll be right back!"", but that doesn't happen.  His plane goes down and he (being the lone survivor) washes up on an island with nothing but his clothes, a load of Fed Ex packages that wash ashore, and an antique watch that Helen Hunt gave him just before he left.  The second act, where the only life you see for a while is Hanks (I don't even think you see a bird or anything else until that whale), is the most compelling and memorable part of the film.  His relationship with ""Wilson"" the volleyball is more believable than the one he has with Helen Hunt (there is also more chemistry between the two).  I feel more sympathy when he loses ""Wilson"" than we he finds Hunt married with children.  The ending is a little weird but what did everyone expect, after 4 years?  Hunt's character  single and waiting in front of her house for someone she attended a funeral for?  The most important part of the film concerns his determination to stay alive on that little island, not his relationship with Hunt (Which, by the way, could have been played by just about any actress).  I don't think that this is just having to endure Hunt in every other movie since ""Good as it gets"" talking either.  There just isn't much chemistry between the two. It is not uncommon for Hunt to lack chemistry with a male character or for there to be some confusion as to why the male is interested in the first place (see Dr. T, What Women Want, etc.).  I think she was cast due to her popularity in other films or maybe Hanks requested her.  Anyway, the film is worth seeing (owning actually) for Hanks' performance and for that little volley ball that took on a larger emotional significance than any other character in the film.",993340800,,2163,4.451776649746193

Some people call this movie boring, well I call them shallow. This movie is deep, moving, and touching. It is by no means exciting except for the plane crash.

This movie deals with the human aspect of being removed from everything you know and having to deal with not having the familiar around to keep you comfortable. If you are looking for exciting fights with the natives and constructing amazing devices from coconut shells and bamboo then you may want to go watch Robinson Crusoe or Gilligans Island. This was, I believe, probably a very difficult movie to make and probably even harder to sell the idea to a studio. Like I said earlier this is not Robinson Crusoe and you aren't given a lot of action to watch but what you are given is a look at just how man deals with what he's dealt. How many times have you found yourself having a conversation with ,well yourself, when no one else is around? Now take away all that you have and all your family and friends and, for that matter everything you have, how would you deal with it? A volleyball might just become a good friend. I don't think this movie would ever have seen the light of day if it hadn't been brought forward by such box office powerhouses as Hanks and Zemeckis and I don't know anyone else who could have pulled it off better than Hanks. So I recommend that you watch this movie but don't watch it for a survivalist action adventure flick watch it for what it is, a statement on the human condition and just how one man copes with what life throws his way.",993340800,107,1448,4.386617100371748

This film has some of the best special effects I've ever seen. It makes The Perfect Storm look precisely like the little boat in a box of water that it was (not to mention paper-thin characters and way too much nonsensical machismo.) The plane crash in Cast Away is so real that the viewer gets a terrifying sense of its actuality. (The only other ""wreck"" sequence I've seen that was comparable was the train wreck in The Fugitive.)
I cannot conceive of any other actor pulling off what Hanks does in this film. He is an actor with such honesty and integrity that he inhabits every character he portrays. And in this case, one cannot help but watch in awe as he invests his formidable skills in this Fedex employee who miraculously survives not only a horrifying plane crash but also a life of total isolation on an unpopulated little island.
What's also amazing is that this film was directed by Robert Zemeckis who's not famous for his sensitivity. But this film has it all: utterly believable characters, a fine script, and more action than most bash-em-up, shoot-em-ups could ever manage on their best days. To see a man we come to care about deeply beat the odds and survive makes for the most rewarding viewing. There's not a single predictable moment, nor a single stock character to be found anywhere in this film.

In the beginning of the movie, he is shown as a FedEx employee who is obsessed with time schedules and spends copious amounts of time on his cell-phone and answering his beeper.  He is a slave to his job as evidenced by a Christmas Day departure for a business trip which forces him and his fiance, played by Helen Hunt, to open their gifts in the car before he leaves.  Helen Hunt is sadly underutilized in this part, by the way.  By far the best scenes in the movie occur during the circumstances which strand him on an uninhabited island and the time in which he lives on the island.  Needless to say, his priorities change drastically and he is kept going by a fading picture of his girlfriend and by accomplishments such as discovering water and creating fire.  The scenes before and after this segment are poorly written and unconvincing and if anyone but Tom Hanks was saying some of these lines, we'd never believe them.

Without the ""product placement"" beast I would have enjoyed this movie enough to buy a copy, but in the theatre I was actually turning from the screen when next 3 minite period elapsed and it was time for another FedEx logo to appear. Truly, it severely hurt the movie and instead of adding a little realism to it, it came off like a big FedEx commercial, even the ending which would have been touchingly sweet was more a FedEx endorsement (neither rain, nor snow nor deserted island can ...) Tom Hanks was brilliant but he played second fiddle to the FedEx logo. Helen Hunt played - er, well she played Helen Hunt. Whatever movie HH plays in she always plays the same character, only the name and circumstances change. Too bad really, she can be charming, but she needs to explore a little and play something besides the sweet, semi-innocent, semi-feminist, semi-emotional, all-American girl.

The most likely reason is the masterful direction of Robert Zemeckis who continues to create quality motion pictures time after time.  Tom Hanks gives one of his stronger performances as Chuck Noland, a Fed-Ex higher-up who gets stranded on a desolate island after his plane crashes.  There is little dialogue during Hanks' time on the island, but it is not needed as Zemeckis tells his story through the camera.  It becomes quite interesting to see the de-evolution of this man as he gets back to primal survival skills.

1286886,5,B00003CXRO,"Gilligan's Island was a cute show, but CASTAWAY is the real thing and a great movie.  It is a change from the seven stranded castaways, for Robert Zemeckis simply threw the ""cast away"" and rode the waves with Tom Hanks.  The Gilligan's Island jingle could have gone something like this:
The plane set down in the ocean somewhere, Near an uncharted Pacific Isle, With Tom Hanks, and Wilson too, the millionaire, Tom Hanks, The movie star (Tom Hanks), the Professor (Hanks), and Hanks again, Here on Tom Hanks' Isle!
So much for my parodic attempt to be funny, but it is true.  If you like Tom Hanks, whom I do, you will love this movie.  Only Russell Crowe's outstanding performance in Gladiator prevented Hanks from holding the golden statue again.  He plays the part of a FedEx consultant, Chuck Noland, who often travels across the world on business, yet one day meets peril on a flight across the Pacific.  He winds up on an island, and this is where the survival story ensues, not only for Chuck, but for the movie as well.  An actor on an island must be very creative, especially with little background music, no conversation, and only natural sound effects like the wind, rain, and waves.
The real question is why Helen Hunt accepted the role of Chuck's girlfriend, Kelly, a limited one in this movie.  Excuse me, but is this ""As Good as it Gets"" for her?  They must have paid a good nickel to secure her services, but she certainly made the most of her part; nevertheless, the best supporting actor goes to Wilson. This is Chuck's wild-haired, blood brother, and confidant, the person that kept him from losing all his mental faculties.  In fact, Tom had a ball with this little fellow and you will be impressed with his performance.
The movie reveals to us the importance of the human relationship. Can a person live alone in life as on an island?  Do we need others to survive and to what extremes will mankind go to have connection with another human being?  The movie answers these questions, and even brings God into the picture.  Do we really have angels watching over us?  Thus, the movie deals with some very real and delicate human issues, issues that we cannot so easily ""cast away""!",993081600,6,2200,4.622107969151671

Hanks delivers an indelible character who runs the gamut of emotions and physical torment in over two hours.  The DVD has exceptional sound/picture.  One of the pure joys was Zemeckis' decision not to use music; only the sounds of the ocean and nature take precedent and shape the character and the story.  The DVD comes very close to capturing the theatre experience.  The extras are great and add a lot to the overall package.

I bought him as ""feeling"" the loss of his best friend beachball Wilson.  I was amazed at his physical transformation (I pray that I never read somewhere that it was a special effect).  I gave the film only four stars because the film, despite Hanks' efforts, became a bit too sappy at the end.  But you know what?  I watched it to the end.  The very end.

When we first starting watching this movie I was completely in love with everything, the characters, the actors, the story line, the effects.  Then came the scene where Chuck returns to meet his ex-girlfriend, Kelly.  From this point on the movie started to go very sour.  I felt that the ending left you with absolutely no answers.  Aside from the fact that there is no way I would be married, with a child, after my ex-soon-to-have-been fiance was thought to be dead.  Maybe, I would be in a serious relationship by then, but not married.  And what was up with the very end of this movie?  Did Chuck go make a new friend?

1287001,5,B00003CXRO,"Having just watched Cast Away for the first time, I am left numbed, speechless, and a little down. Don't get me wrong, if a movie leaves me like this it means it's a hell of a good movie. When I'm left in this disposition I am always at my most thoughtful.  Cast Away for those of you who don't know, and to be honest I didn't know much about it previously, is a powerful story which tugs hard at the emotions of even the most hardened movie goers.  It's the story of Chuck Nolan, a succesful Fed Ex System's Analyser who's job it is to travel the world in a bid to strengthen the reputation of the company. To cut a long story fairly short, his work is demanding. So demanding in fact that he at times neglects the relationship he has with his girlfriend. One Christmas Day he's called away suddenly on important business, and whilst flying over the Pacific is involved in a plane crash from which he survives.
The rest you will surely find out for yourselves. Dialogue after this point is few and far between, Hanks' particular relationship that he forms with a Volley Ball of all things is one of the most defining elements of this movie - you may laugh if you haven't yet seen it, but an actor has far, far gone beyond the call of duty when he gets the audience to care about an inanimate object. It's a tale of isolation, 4 years of isolation in fact, 4 years without human interaction - his only inspiration to perservere being a photograph of his beloved girlfriend.
There are some fantastically directed scenes in this movie which will force you to choke back tears - ironically, the most significant one being when he loses ""Wilson"" the volley ball. Interestingly, we see how, on Chuck's return, society is so willing to neglect it's new cast away. The only bad point I can possibly think of would be the BIG ADVERT for Fed Ex, but then again it adds an element of reality.

1287004,3,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away reteams director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for their first film together since the Award winning Forrest Gump.  The film tells the story of a Federal Express employee, Chuck,  who is stranded on a deserted island in the South Pacific.  He is forced to use his wits to survive.  The survival scenes are sandwiched in between Chuck's life in Memphis pre and post island.  The pre-island scenes show Chuck as a time obsessed man, whose main goal is to make certain packages arrive on time.  He shows off his tyrannical devotion to time in the movie's opening scenes where he is training people at a new depot in Moscow.  Back home for Christmas, we meet his girlfriend, Kelly, played by Helen Hunt.  On Christmas day he is called off again and he promises Kelly he'll be home for New Year's Eve and at the airport they exchange gifts.  Kelly gives Chuck a pocket watch and amongst his gifts is an engagement ring.  On this flight, the plane encounters turbulence and goes down.  The crash is a fiery spectacle that shows off Mr. Zemeckis' skill as a director.  Chuck is the lone survivor and he washes up on the island.  Armed with only a few items (ice skates, videotapes) from Fed Ex packages, he forced to adapt to live on the album.  His lone companion is a volleyball he names Wilson (the ball's maker).  Wilson is really an extension of Chuck himself as his ""face"" was created a bloody palm print of Chuck's own hand.  It is on the island where we see the acting skills that make Mr. Hanks the best in the business.  Through his struggles to make fire, eat, drink and eventually build a boat to leave the island.  He literally all by himself, with only Wilson to interact with.  Mr. Hanks' draws our sympathy and we share in his frustrations.  We feel his desperation and the scene where he kicks Wilson out of a cave and then desperately searches for him in the dark is utterly heartbreaking.  After four years Chuck leaves the island and is rescued at sea.  Upon his return to Memphis, he finds that he was of course left for dead and even buried.  Kelly has married and has a child.  In a tearful reunion, Kelly declares she still loves him, but they both know their relationship can't work.  Cast Away suffers in the scenes off the island as they filled with movie cliches and are stiff.  The scenes on the island are worth watching to see this generation's greatest actor shine.",992822400,6,2400,4.523255813953488
1287005,4,B00003CXRO,"Russell Crowe was, without a doubt, very good in ""Gladiator"", but Tom Hanks in ""Cast Away"" is superb. It is in this film, that one finds the actor whose performance was truly Oscar worthy. Those who voted Crowe over Hanks as this year's recipient of the best actor Oscar had their heads in the sand, as Hanks gives a performance that I do not think that even he can equal.
This film is like a play in three acts. What life was like before being cast away. What life was like as a castaway. What life was like after being cast away. After having seen the film,  the title of the movie is somewhat ambiguous, upon reflection. It could easily refer to the status of Hanks' character during either the middle or ending sequence of the film. I leave it to the viewer to decide this conundrum.
Hanks flawlessly plays the role of Chuck Noland (Was there a pun intended here?), a highly energized, time obsessed, systems engineer for Federal Express. On Christmas Eve, he makes a last minute decision to board a flight and escort some packages on a run to their destination. He pops the question to his girlfriend Kelly, played by Helen Hunt, and presents her with an engagement ring just seconds before he boards his ill fated flight. What then happens on that flight is no secret. Suffice to say that it is a wonderfully filmed disaster scene that is sure to strike terror in even the most blase of travelers.
The second part of the movie is the crux of the film. For nearly an hour, Hanks is the only living human being on film. He totally carries the day and sustains the film with the power of his performance. We watch as he survives the rigors of his days and copes with the solitude that comes with being marooned on a deserted island for four years, sustained by a photograph of his fiancee, Kelly. Hanks captivates the viewer with his sense of joy and wonder as he creates fire. We watch as his loneliness drives him to invent a friend, Wilson, out of a volleyball that washes ashore. Hanks' performance is such that the viewer mourns the eventual loss of Wilson and experiences the poignancy of that moment when Hanks and Wilson are irrevocably parted.
The third part with the film has to do with his being rescued. Having withstood four years as a survivalist on the island, Hanks' character decides that no life is better than the life that he was leading. Making a raft, he makes for the open seas, taking his chances. He is rescued, but after four years the life he left behind has all but disappeared. Kelly has moved on with her life, and he, in effect, has been cast away. It is here that the picture falters somewhat, as there is no happy ending and the film ends somewhat unresolved. Still, it is an excellent film, and Hanks' performance is definitely award calibre.",992822400,13,2779,4.5029702970297025

1287106,4,B00003CXRO,"First of all, this review is about the movie. All the extras on the DVD are great but bottom line the movie quality has to be there, right? Cast Away is a solid, well done movie. The special effects of the plane crash are heart stopping, and Tom Hanks is wonderful as the main (and really only) character. In fact I enjoyed the movie all the way until he got rescued. At that point the movie got downright depressing. Yes I realize that the idea was to put him into the same issues within a different enviroment, but geez, give the guy a break. The symbolism at this point became way to obvious. For instance, the final scene of Jack standing in the middle of a intersection out in the middle of nowhere looking in all four directions. As if he was at the ""crossroads"" of his life.
Again, I enjoyed this movie overall. However it's also the type of movie I'll never watch again. I would recommend this to any Tom Hanks fan (he's at his best here), any epic movie fan (It's pretty darn long) and any one who really just wants to sit back and enjoy the movie experience.",992649600,,1068,4.292079207920792

From the people I know that have seen it, they are spit like a bananna peel (or a coconut shell.) So, probably half of you will not like what I have to say, but, maybe I can tempt that half...to come to the right side. Castaway is a three part mystery about the American Experience, from an American that has both been thickly involved with daily life, and torn from it dramatically. I bought this dvd last night, so nah nah nah. I feel like the kid that is holding that last piece of candy, you kow, the one who grabs a good thing and runs with it. Castaway, was a fully envolved project that has a very good payoff. (Spoiler!)I understand film, and I understand plot. I know that this movie could have ended when the big boat drifted along side Noland's craft. But what about those people that he touched, what kind of effect did his life leave, and what things needed to change. He had to go back, so we could see the answers. And as for the ending, It is the main character saying, ""I could do anything that I want. I am as bare as when I was on that Island, and I really haven't even left yet, but this time I can do whatever I want.""  And there is the mystery.

Yes, the film wants to be about more than Robinson Crusoe, thus the emotional/relationship drama is given much more space than expected ... but that's not we went to see. Whether the symbolism of the title works on more than one level is clever, but the fact that it wasn't emphasized in the trailers seems to say that the producers knew that the moviegoing public wasn't too interested in that aspect either.
The first half of the movie works, and we identify with Hanks' character, and begin to ask ourselves how we would have fared, and all the comforts we take for granted ... but before we can witness more of his transformation from hapless modern man to wizened hunter-gatherer, he is rescued.
Then the second part of the movie begins ... but do we really care?

Sound: DD (4 Stars), DTS (5 Stars)
DVD Extras 3.5 Stars
I have read in various entertainment articles back when Cast Away first premiered in December of 2000, that Zemeckis's original ending had Hanks and Hunt ending up together at the end of the movie, but after careful thought and test screening, Zemeckis threw that ending away and reshot the ending that we know of today.  Zemeckis thought that Hanks and Hunt becoming lovers again after all that time would not seem believable by the audience, so he changed it to reflect a more realistic ending of Hanks moving on with life.
My question is, where is this ""alternative ending""?  Does it exist?  If it does, isn't that why DVD's exist?  To include those deleted shots and endings that we all crave!  Therefore, without the alternative ending, the extras get 3.5 stars from me.  Overall DVD, 4 Stars.",992563200,,871,4.735099337748345

1287113,2,B00003CXRO,"Tom Hanks saves this film.  Quite a bit of the problem I had watching the DVD (I did not see it in theaters) is that the plot is so incredibly simple that it has been completely given away in even the simplest of commercials.  I was hoping to see much 'more' in the movie, but felt like I was watching a very long rerun even though I had never seen it before.
Helen Hunt is nothing special in this film, could have been anyone in that role.  The actress in the truck at the end of the film showed more acting ability.
Luckily, the kids were sound asleep and I had the time to kill.  It was good, but I should have rented instead of bought.  Several shots on the island were spectacular, but they were sandwiched between average shots.
The themes were exactly what you expect.  Don't live by the clock, live to your real priorities, don't give up, blah blah.  Great messages, but was not executed well enough to be the foundation of a film.  They seemed trite.",992563200,4,959,4.288888888888889
1287114,4,B00003CXRO,"I enjoyed this movie. Tom Hanks did a superb job as the gratification-delaying Chuck Noland, speeding towards his first ulcer (I could hardly recognize him). I thought the plane-crash scenes were first-rate and, of course, the parallel with old Robinson Crusoe were very apparent (after four years, you wouldn't be able to tell them apart!). The overly-generous use of the Federal Express name, premises and equipment meant that the movie had to tread awfully carefully (wouldn't Chuck open ALL the packages washed ashore?), still, FedEx ought to be commended for what it did allow. I thought ""Wilson"" (his volleyball ""friend"") was a bit silly, but who knows how any of us will react with no company for four years? What impressed me, though, was that this movie always remained credible. The treatment of the end phase, where Chuck is re-united with his girlfriend, Kelly, was believeable and sensitive.

1287234,5,B00003CXRO,"""Cast Away"" entertains one of man's worst fears: being absolutely alone in a place of heat with almost no drinkable water for possibly the rest of his life. Chuck Noland(Tom Hanks), a Fed Ex employee must live this after his plane crashes in the middle of the Atlantic. The film begins on a crossroad in Texas. The title ""Cast Away"" and not Castaway appears on the screen which means that Tom Hanks does not only become a Castaway but that he is Cast Away from civilized society. A Fed Ex truck turns the corner and picks up a package from an artists barn that is home to a workshop which creates wings as a form of art(This film is full of symbolism). From here we arrive in Russia in which we discover Noland giving a speech on the importance of time. Life for him revolves around time and it is the perfect job for him because Fed Ex is ""The World On Time"". He makes it home and has Christmas dinner with his girlfriend Kelly Frears(Helen Hunt). After dinner he must leave Kelly to return to his job. In the air there is a large storm, the plane loses pressure and crashes into the Atlantic. Chuck opens the life raft and becomes the only survivor of the crash. He lands hours later on a desolate island where he will have to make his home. He eventually adapts to his surroundings by drinking coconut milk and making a fire which will allow him to have hot food. His only friend on the island is a personified soccerball named Wilson. Tom Hanks is the type of actor who's acting can make you care about something as inanimate as a soccer ball. He carries this entire film by being on screen by himself for the majority of the film. The character of Kelly Frears is only on screen for about 15 minutes but you can feel her presence throughout. Starting off, this DVD has a crystal clear picture with an aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The commentary features insight from Robert Zemekis and many members of his crew. There are barely any quiet moments. The extras are composed of special effects vignettes, multiple documentaries, a storyboard to film comparison, and two theatrical trailers and many T.V. spots. This is a film to own and everytime you watch, you will notice more interesting things about it.",992476800,3,2204,4.498753117206983
1287235,4,B00003CXRO,"This movie is to Tom Hanks what the Cable Guy was to Jim Carrey. In Cable Guy everyone expected another Ace Ventura and instead got a wonderful black comedy. Unfortunately in most people's minds Carrey wasn't supposed to do black comedy and this truly remarkable performance was ignored and the movie floundered.
In Cast Away Tom Hanks leaves his gosh-golly everyman and becomes an time obsessed FedEx manager named Chuck Noland. Through circumstances he becomes stranded on an island in the South Pacific. For almost an hour we share the island with Chuck and a ball named Wilson. While it might sound odd it is really very captivating and entertaining.
In a stock movie the Hanks character would have been found and lived happily ever after, however in Cast Away the ending is intelligent and much more interesting.
The DVD extras are on a separate disk and are complete from trailers through interviews to featurettes. The interview with Charlie Rose is curious but gives you an idea of the time and effort it takes for even Tom Hanks to develop a project and get it filmed. It is curious because throughout the interview Rose appears unprepared, careless, and inept which makes it almost painful yet peculiarly intriguing to watch.
People will say of Cast Away that it wasn't Hanks at his best or that the story was flawed. Personally, I think that Hanks was brilliant and the storyline was original and refreshing. To dismiss this film is to dismiss both a well crafted and entertaining movie and a superlative performace by Tom Hanks.",992476800,,1540,4.859315589353612
1287236,4,B00003CXRO,"Let me rant first, and then explain my 4 star rating.
I watched this on DVD, and I experienced something that is becoming more and more common on DVDs: an irritatingly slow appearance of the menu. When DVDs first came out, I thought it was just incredible that you pop them in, and almost immediately would get the menu that would allow you without delay to access the features you wanted. If you wanted to watch the film immediately with no delay, that is what you did. More and more, however, DVDs are packing pre-Menu material. With CAST AWAY, you get the Interpol warning, followed by previews (that you can close out of), and then, before the menu itself finally comes into view, a slow loading picture of Tom Hanks face that only gruadually fades away to reveal the selection menu. But even then, when you click on your option, it again only very slowly takes you to the feature you want. What I ended up doing was bookmarking the opening credits, so that if I ever wanted to watch the movie again, I could bypass all this nonsense to get right to the film.
I wonder if the DVD makers understand what a pain this all is? I wonder if they understand that one of the greatest attractions of DVDs is the fact that DVDs give the viewers what they want. I want widescreen, not full screen. I want to get right to the film. Not watch a bunch of previews and plodding menu graphics. Remember KISS: Keep it Simple Stupid. Some DVDs now even give you nonoptional advertisements and previews. They are ruining a very good thing.
Now, the movie. The makers of CAST AWAY did a great job given the fact that this is basically a movie where almost nothing happens, and, what is more, almost nothing could happen. ROBINSON CRUSOE dealt pretty much with the same story. But the difference between it and CAST AWAY is the fact that ROBINSON CRUSOE is very much a novel of ideas. Because it if very difficult to discuss many ideas in a movie without much dialog, that was not really an option for CAST AWAY. The challenge to the filmmakers, therefore, was to flesh out what was necessarily a bare bones plot. They achieved this by chopping the movie into four parts: 1) the prequel to the arrival to the island (including the very exciting plane crash sequence, easily the best part of the movie and one of the best plane crashes I have seen), 2) Tom Hanks's time on the island, the longest segment in the movie, 3) his escape from the island, and 4) his arrival home. The last part was a lot longer than what one might have expected, but because there had been very little action in the film, it was necessary to give it balance.
The one real shortcoming in the film is the difficulty of coming up with much dramatic action. The strength in the film is the fact that they did such an incredible job of overcoming so many of the limitations.
Tom Hanks was great, as usual. One of the more interesting aspects of his role was the fact that in the first part of his time on the island, he is a bit blobby. Definite gut. Near the end of his time on the island, he has really shaped up. Must have taken a few thousand crunches to get those abs! Great work (out) Tom! One mark at how very, very good he is was shown in his relation with ""Wilson"", a volley ball upon which he painted (in his own blood) a face and with whom he developed a relationship. Now, on one level, this was very, very silly. But Hanks played it to the hilt, and at the end, when Wilson and Tom are parted, you feel his intense grief at losing his only friend.
The rest of the cast really didn't matter. This was a one man movie. But, for what it is worth, the supporting cast was solid enough.
There was, however, one major star of the movie other than Tom Hanks, and that was the island itself. Just a great locale. Dramatic, beautiful, and yet, just forbidding enough, it was the perfect costar for Tom Hanks.
So, not a perfect movie, but nonetheless a very good one. And if you enjoy Tom Hanks's work, as I do, it will provide a couple of hours of great entertainment, IF you can get past the opening menu.
By the way, I have had a couple of friends ask me if I thought Hanks rather than Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar. I gave them a two part answer, which I will repeat here. First, while I thought he deserved the Oscar more than Crowe (I am a HUGE Russell Crowe fan, and I definitely thought he deserved the Oscar for THE INSIDER, but THE GLADIATOR, while good, is not one of his very best roles), I thought the Oscar for best actor should have gone to someone who was not even nominated: Jamie Bell for BILLY ELIOTT.",992476800,,4581,4.334109429569266

If you're looking for fast-paced, predictable, ""cookie-cutter"" Hollywood fluff, this movie is not for you. But...with a little imagination and an open mind, you may appreciate the movie for what it was intended:  Cast Away is hilariously funny, crushingly tragic, occasionally shocking, and above all, a celebration of the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.",992476800,,633,5.383838383838384
1287238,3,B00003CXRO,"Picture a young school-kid who has made a model of Camelot using wood and styrofoam. Picture the child as he or she happily walks to school, proud to turn his work into his history class for the eventual top grade. Now watch as fate intervenes as the child trips on an uneven curb, sending his model crashing to the ground. The child cries and sobs...and then looks up to see the model is still VERY much intact. The only thing the child DIDN'T super-glue to death were the little action-figurines used to portray the inhabitants of Camelot...and a tip of Arthur's tower is slightly smashed.
It's fixable...but why go to the trouble when 99 percent of the project is very much okay and ready to present and will knock the socks off of all the other kids who used a simple shoebox to present the Round Table room???
This is the case for director Robert Zemeckis. Even though he sometimes stumbles, his stuff is still fun to watch. And it's because of beautiful special effects a very real(and VERY Oscar-worthy) performance by the ever-dynamic Tom Hanks, and a(mostly) smart script.
CASTAWAY is the story of Chuck Noland(Hanks), a systems-engineer for the FedEx company(methinks FedEx had to be paid a TON to both sponsor the film and portray one of their delivery jets crashing and losing thousands of packages). He's obssessed with time and things going the way they're supposed to. His marriage is what it is: Chuck and his wife Kelly(the overrated Helen Hunt in an underrated performance) see each other in short bursts but are very happy with the agreement they have and actually SMILE at each other during their day-to-day meetings.
Then comes Christmas Eve and Chuck's leaving his wife again. He's off to personally escort a few packages(God knows WHY he has to do this but the script demands it for plot-movement) to their destinations by Christmas Day. This scene comes complete with ill-fated dialogue and the totally clichd, ""I'll be right back"", spoken to Kelly(or yelled-to to be more accurate) by the equally ill-fated Chuck. I remember actually yelling at my T.V. set that you NEVER say that in a movie(see ""Scream"" and you'll know why) but what the heck do I know???
Once aboard, the pilots decide to avert a major storm by flying AROUND it...so much for THAT idea. The plane crashes into the South Pacific faster than a Randy Johnson-fastball and Chuck is outcast via a raft from said plane to a deserted island with no technology, no islanders, no Jurassic Park dinosaurs, and NO WAY TO GET HOME.
From here on, we get to watch Noland stumble around the island trying to obtain food, water, and shelter as well as an idea for how he's going to get off the island and get back to his life...all of which takes four years.
Now, before the nay-sayers comment that ""this could have been really good"" and call it BAD, I say that this could have been really BAD and I'm calling it good. It's actor Hanks and director Zemeckis's time and patience that pulls off the impossible(in their first re-teaming since ""Forrest Gump""). Noland turns desparate as you see him go through the stages of becoming a survivor(fear, anger, acceptance, etc.), befriend a volleyball(which he paints a face on with his own blood and even goes so far as to implant ""hair"" using twigs and what-not), create fire(in a hilariously bittersweet scene), and spear fish and crab for edible goods.
I've read both sides of the debate on this film and I'm caught in the middle. I think this movie is successful. Robert Zemeckis makes a film that touches you not so much on an emotional level(not even the stupid volleyball evoked a sniffle when we witness its fate), but on a philosophical level. Before Hanks hits the island, he's a hurried man who rushes everything and yells at the top of his lungs. After the island, he's transformed into something humbled. You would think he would have trouble accepting his new life after he gets back home...but by now, it's so easy to him. Chuck has survived the hell of isolation and pain by himself. He makes his decisions without sadness, without angst, and with much acceptance. It's the primitive equivilant of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"".
Yes, the film's point is EXTREMELY heavy-handed: ""time is important so make the most of it"" and blah, blah, blah...but Zemeckis has such a wonderful way of softening the hand that's slapping you in the face(just like he softened it for ""Gump"" and the soft-spoken ""Contact""), that it's easy to take. His use of sound and the decision to use no music score during the island-scenes was the perfect choice. In my opinion, scoring the island-scenes would have dumbed the film down.
Not a great film, not a horrible film. ""Castaway"" is a good film that shows you one man's accelerated journey through life in which he learns the true meaning of becoming a mature human being.
(A couple of notes here: the ""winking-whale"" effect comes off as silly and why doesn't search-and-rescue follow the trail of loose-drifting packages since most seemed to end up on the isle with Chuck???)

My only irritation with the DVD is the commentary, which is quite maddening because you have some Foley putz ( and a Lighting guy) droning on and on about how they made sounds and lighting effects in post production. I'm not kidding. Robert Zemeckis' part of the commentary, I'm willing to bet, does not add up to ten minutes of conversation. Nothing of great importance as to character and plot is discussed, you just have to listen to that Foley ... go on and on about the importance of sound. I was so pissed that I actually yelled out to the recording, begging the sound schmuck to shut up. Disc two has a lot of good extras, so you still get your money's worth, but the commentary is the lamest I have ever heard; I can't imagine listening to one as bad as it on another DVD anytime in the future.",992390400,,868,4.298780487804878
1287242,4,B00003CXRO,"The most simplistic elements of life are taken for granted everyday of our lives. We turn on the lights without a second thought; we light matches without a moment's hesitation. Water coming out of the faucet is a given, something we know we can always depend on to be there. ""Cast Away"" takes all of those securities and hides them away, leaving us with an incredible and harrowing story of survival and determination.
Taking its time in getting to what the movie is all about, the story first begins with the frenzied life of Fed-Ex systems engineer Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), whose number-one rule of life is making sure that everything goes according to schedule. This leaves him little time for his understanding girlfriend, Kelly (Helen Hunt), whom he returns to see in Memphis for Christmas. Circumstances intervene, and he finds himself rearranging his schedule in order to make a trip across the Pacific for business. But not before exchanging gifts, one of which is an engagement ring, the other an ""I'll be right back.""
After a near-10-minute plane crash sequence that raises the intensity, the true Zemeckis style kicks into gear, as Chuck is left in a rubber life raft in stormy seas, the only light source coming from sudden flashes of lightning. At daylight, he finds himself on an island, not another soul in sight and only the sound of crashing waves and wind in the trees for company. Instincts drive him to signal for help at first, and as the days move on, he silently realizes his situation.
The story becomes more intriguing with the transition of time during his stay on the island: he learns the secrets of creating life's little commodities. Resorting to stick-rubbing for the creation of fire and collection condensation from leaves for nourishment, the only visible objects that tie his present life to reality are a Fed-Ex box, his battered life-raft, and a volleyball with a blood-painted face whom he calls Wilson. But as Chuck becomes more attached to life on the island, he cannot shake his desire to once again return home to his love, whose picture he repeatedly paints on the wall.
Let's be honest: this is probably the best deserted island movie to date, possibly ever made. ""Swiss Family Robinson"" was less engrossing because there was a family on the island, not a single person. Being alone on the island allows the story to explore the inner human strength and spirit, as well as new methods of companionship.
Other techniques bring the movie to a full-force magnitude that keeps us engrossed with what goes on. During the entire island sequence, from the time he arrives to the time he is plucked from the sea, there is a complete absence of music. This leaving out of the musical score gives an added focus to his situation as well as reflecting on his solitude and loneliness. The nature surrounding Chuck is beautifully captured and photographed, and under Zemeckis's helm, the setting is ominous and brooding without becoming too overpowering.
Hanks gives, without a doubt, the best performance to date of his career, topping his work in ""Forrest Gump."" His acting, along with the aforementioned techniques, puts us right there with him as he begins to learns the small things in life can be quite complicated. Even his silence is our key to understanding his realizations about the potential danger he faces, and his comprehension of what seems to him an inescapable situation. At the movie's end, I felt compelled to inquire why Russell Crowe received the Best Actor Oscar for his work in ""Gladiator,"" when the performance by Hanks is much more involving.
But, like any good movie, there are flaws. Luckily, this movie escaped fairly unscathed, until the ending, however. At movie's end, it loses the same luster it had before, and the return to reality and the emotional challenges he will face are less intriguing or involving as those presented in the midsection of the story. And the silence experienced for so long seems shaken in a bad way once everything begins to round itself out.
Nonetheless, ""Cast Away"" is a compelling tale spun from the director of ""Contact,"" who tells the story the way it needs to be told. Hanks brings his best screenwork to the movie, while the entire effect of the movie is one of sheer awe and enamoration. Did you ever wish you were on a deserted island with someone else? You may just think twice.",992390400,,4381,4.834886817576565

1287321,4,B00003CXRO,"A globetrotting Fed-Ex employee named Chuck (Tom Hanks), after kissing his sweetheart Kelly (Helen Hunt) goodbye at the airport, hops onto a Fed-Ex plane that eventually runs into major trouble during a fierce storm, and plummets into the sea. The plane's crew all perish, but Chuck is miraculously washed ashore on a deserted island, where he must fend for himself, using only the island's elements at his disposal, as well as some Fed-Ex packages that wash ashore from the plane wreckage....
Remember the great sci-fi cult classic from the early 60's, ""Robinson Crusoe On Mars,"" about a U.S. astronaut stranded all alone on the red planet? ""Cast Away"" seems to borrow somewhat from this film, with a few changes. Instead of futuristic gadgets to work with, our hero has Fed-Ex packages. Instead of an adorable wooly monkey & an alien slave for company, our stranded protagonist has a volleyball that he draws a face on, names it Wilson (get it?), and talks to it. Personally, I'll give ""Cast Away"" credit where credit is due: despite being a disjointed film, it is Tom Hanks' terrific performance as Chuck that makes ""Cast Away"" the absorbing film that it is.
For the big middle section of ""Cast Away,"" the movie is basically The Tom Hanks Show: he's all that we see for the large second act of the film (which spans four years). There's lots of quiet time in this part of the film, too---Hanks doesn't speak very much (at least, not at first) as he struggles to survive on the island. And yet, as he goes from being washed ashore, to scouting out the island, to collecting the packages that wash up on the beach, to figuring out how to make fire and get food, to talking to his volleyball chum Wilson, etc., Hanks remains very compelling in the role of Chuck throughout. With any other actor in the role, this film could've been a major snoozefest. But with Hanks at it's center, you remain absorbed in his adventure (and needless to say, Hanks has got another well-deserved Oscar nomination headed his way with this one). And kudos to director Robert Zemeckis for his skillful direction of his star, as well as his incredible photography.
If ""Cast Away"" has any faults, it's that the film is a bit disjointed in it's storytelling, and the final portion of the film goes on a little too long. Unfortunately, I can't go into any of this without heading into spoiler territory. But in the end, what it all comes down to is this: your enjoyment of ""Cast Away"" primarily depends on whether or not you care about Tom Hanks' Fed-Ex man and what happens to him. Me? I DID care about this guy and what happens to him. Therefore, despite being imperfect, ""Cast Away"" still gets a solid recommendation from me.

1287326,4,B00003CXRO,"Castaway would have been even a better movie if Tom Hanks would have just remained on the island, or maybe the final scene would have been seeing that he just gets rescued.  Hollywood got their fingers into the mix, most likely, and nearly ruined the movie.
However, the movie works brilliantly as a documentary.  It really should have been called ""How We Learn"" (but of course, then, noone would have seen it) because it shows the true iterative process that people go through to learn a new task.  Tom Hanks, and maybe even more the director, was great at showing how inept the castaway was when Hanks first landed on the island at even doing the ""simplest"" tasks.  The scene where he tries to get a fire started was great, because it took long enough, even in ""movie time"" for us to know that this is no trivial matter without matches.  (I nearly felt blisters on my fingers by the time that he got his first fire!)  How many times have we seen actors in a movie learn a new task and perform it perfectly the first time (just watch any dance flick)?  It just doesn't happen that way.  Thankfully, Castaway doesn't insult our intelligence and shows us how painful learning really can be.
Does the director's cut remove the ending?  Because if it does, this fine documentary will be soon showing on the Discovery Channel.  Otherwise, catch the movie version for ""free"" on HBO and save your $100.",992304000,,1396,4.570281124497992

This is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life.  Tom Hanks is a fantastic Actor who pushes his acting talent to the very limit and beyond.  Its too bad he didint win best actor at the academy awards.  The film itself is excelent.  At first you are treated to Tom fussing about in Russia, eating a gigantic dinner and getting a birthday gift.  All the wile you are waiting for the fantastic Island sequences.  Well trust me its worth it.  The plane crash sequence is the most realistic and frightining crash I have ever seen.  The rest of the film is excellent.  I could go on blabbering about the island, toms acting but a few things stand out above the rest.  The music (All 10 minutes of it) is very good but made me wish for more.  Wilson the vollyball is one of the finest actors hollywood has ever seen.  He has solid acting, a great expression and a great guy all around.  He should have won best supporting actor at the academy awards.  However I should point out this movies 2 flaws.  The first is that some sequences are too scary or too grusome for anyone under 14, heck Im 14 and I had trouble ingesting this stuff.  Tom getting scrapped against the coral, Tom getting a really big splinter in his hand in graphic detail, and (Shudder) the skating shoe in the mouth moment is one of the most painfull scenes I have ever had to watch.

1287413,4,B00003CXRO,"Cast Away is definitely one of the most memorable films of the year. It does remarkably well with such an old concept, the stranded-on-an-island premise. But thanks to the direction and Tom Hanks, we frequently forget it is rooted in clich.
Hanks plays a Federal Express employee who is always keeping track of time to deliver the next package. One day his plane crashes in the sea and he becomes stranded on a deserted island.
The middle bulk of the film, I'd guess about one and a half hours long, taking place on the island, is fantastic. This is quite an unconventional film, at least in this part of the movie-- it quietly, methodically, silently shows us how Hanks tries to survive the island. There is no music and no dialogue at all for 20-minute stretches at a time, and the only dialogue that does appear is when Hanks makes friends with a volleyball. It lets us simply watch the battle between Hanks and nature. (What's also appreciated is how the film doesn't use any of the standard desert-island clichs that have shown up in film recently: no hostile natives and no drug smugglers.)
When talking about the acting here, there's only one person you can mention, because no one else is on screen long enough to make an impression. Hanks' acting is great. And no, I don't mean his physical transformation. That is indeed impressive, but that's not acting- that's fitting the physical requirements for the role. No, I'm talking about his acting: the way he convinces us he's going mad on the island without turning it into a comedic parody of itself, the way he makes us feel sympathy for a beach ball, and the way he becomes so attached to the island that he cries at the thought of leaving it. He has a tough job in this film, to not only act well but support the entire film with his acting alone, and he succeeds wonderfully.
As for the bookends of the film, the beginning is fairly standard, setting up the themes we know will be touched upon, but the ending is very effective, sad and realistic. It is during this final part of the film that, as a couple of reviewers have already pointed out, we finally understand the true meaning of the title.
All in all, Cast Away is a great film, and a great DVD, too. Two discs of features should give one plenty of extra viewing time. Most notable are the always-appreciated director's commentary, supplied by Robert Zemeckis, and a featurette on Wilson, the volleyball.

1287414,4,B00003CXRO,"Perhaps half the people giving this film a bad review actually believe the title of the movie is the first one. Okay, put on your glasses and look again: That's right. There is a space between Cast and Away.
Still don't get it? Then I have to say you are unable to view a piece of art objectively. This film is full of symbolism (maybe far too subtle for you guys who think this film is disappointing and awkwardly paced) and deliberation of creating spacial and chronical gap. Those who claimed the jump of four years is too sudden to make us sympathise with the character? To be honest if more scenes were included you would start whining that it is too long and boring. When a person is utterly alone on an island, having to learn how to survive from the ground up, time and space do not make sense. The four-year gap created just that.
Tom Hanks performance? He is clearly robbed off an Oscar. Not that Russell Crowe is bad, but because Hanks is far more superior. The comments about he was overacting toward Wilson? Imagine if there is anyone else doing the exact same thing to a ball and still make you laugh, at the same time, break your heart. During the time on the island, there are no background music nor spetacular action sequence to keep our attention span running but Hanks' sole performance. Do you still think he is overrated? In the beginning he has already established his personality as this 'must-do-it-right' workaholic, and that last box he did not open is a mission that he needs to accomplish (notice that he only found it after he was settled on the island?) This unopened box is his hope. His hope back to where he was from.
Think the ending is disappointing? Of course it is. It is the predicament of life (anyone recall the last scene of the movie?). Nothing in real life is always satisfying, and Cast Away tells us exactly that. At first it mercilessly strips us apart from the civilized materialism, then gives us hope and makes us strong. It shows us the majesty of mother nature and the struggle against the odds. It eventually takes us to where we are so used to call home and shatters us with the inevitiable truth of reality, of how cruel time could be. Finally, it reminds us how tiny we seem when standing in the middle of cross road, yet the hope is still vastly endless.
We don't need to know what is in the box, just as we never need to find out what was stored in your neighbor's ice box. He achieved his mission of delivering the box back to its owner, (despite it disobeyed the over-night promise by FedEx) and that is what really matters.

It's a film that you can watch over and over, but the best part is the first viewing.  The character development, the dialouge (or lack of it) and the cinematography all leave the viewer in a thoughtful, interesting state of mind.  It's a good film and the best part of it is the script.  The last twenty minutes of the film are simply amazing and a lot of people seamed to miss the point.  It's a film that takes time (to watch) and time (to think and comprehend what you just saw).

He might as well be Amelia Earhart for all the assistance and company he has gotten over the years.
The point of this movie is made subtlely. With Zemekis, one of our most imaginative American directors at the helm, and Tom Hanks, one of our greatest actors and surely the ONLY reason Hollywood has ANY excuse WHATSOEVER to hold up its head in the ""reality genre"" of acting--the man is so human and never misses a beat-- we have here...well, what we have here is the tale of a man of determination and strong will, his love for life, as symbolized by a photo of the woman he left behind in Memphis, and his relationship with his best friend Wilson (classic Zemekis Touch, Wilson is).
I don't know about you, but I have found out that things, even if they don't turn out perfectly in life, are good if there are ""possibilities"". For the future. I think this is the mild, sweet point this movie is making, and I liked it. I liked the light touch, the sudden humor at times, even the devotion between a man and his ball.

1287417,5,B00003CXRO,"Rare is it that an actor with such talent as Tom Hanks could convincingly portray four different characters in one film with so many realistic and underlying messages. Here, he portrays man who is a workaholic who has very little time for the precious things in life, such as his relationship with his girlfriend. He is a company man who pushes aside many things to get his job done. Once shipwrecked, he becomes the learner and survivor, who now is educating himself about himself and the environment. He experiences loss of human contact, friendship, loved ones, and his own failures. As the years pass, he now plays a survivor, who has mastered each day, and creates his own world of friendship. Upon his return to civilization, his final portrayal is that of all three people, and the addition of a fourth, who now must deal with loss of love, time, and the inevitable reality of being directionless with many directions to embark upon. This is such a parallel artform to many individuals each day who suffer such trials of loss, be it in divorce, death, or employment. Each moral of this wonderful story applies to our lives.

I would offer an observation that not many have mentioned.  There are two scenes in the movie in which Hanks' character looks in each of the cardinal directions.  The first of these occurs at the top of the island: he looks north, south, east, and west... seeing nothing except water.  He is alone on the island, and there is no solace.  The second of the two occurs near the end of the film at the crossroads: he looks again in each direction and sees nothing but land.  Loneliness in all but one direction, and that is the direction he settles on.

It's called Cast Away not because Hanks' character is marooned on an island but because he is cast away by his fiancee.  When you realize that you can fully appreciate the movie.  I'm glad to see that at least one other person knows the truth (See: Extraordinary by Dr. Christopher Coleman).  Once you know this truth then the whole movie opens up to you.  The four year marooning is an interlude that trys to distract you from the real meat of the movie.  It tries to put you in Noland's shoes and get you to think about surviving.  Soon you forget about Helen Hunt's character.  Then when Noland returns you realize that he has been gone for four years.  She thought he was dead.

There have been several comments on the ""drawn out"" scenes in this movie and I have to believe that it is our societies obsession with special effects and action that have allowed this movie to slip through the cracks as one of the better movies ever made.
The most compelling parts of the movie were dealing with the character's drive to survive on the island. The fact that Zemekis spent so much of the movie on the island was ingenious! What kind of movie would this have been if 4 years on an island converted to only 30 minutes of screen time? The time spent on the island gave the movie a feeling of authenticity. The real wonder is how the movie keeps you entertained when silence is such a large portion of the movie. It's in these times that we truely connect with the everyday man that Hank's is so brilliantly portraying.
This movie is like nothing I've seen before and ranks as one of my favorites of all time!

What one expects from the intentional double meaning two-word title is that our hero experience some kind of spiritual enlightenment from the enforced ""casting away"" of civilization's ephemera.  But that is not the case here.
It's not giving anything away here to say that during his absence he has been declared dead and his fiancee Helen Hunt has married.  But since we've recently seen Hunt cavorting on screen with Mel Gibson, Jack Nicholson, Richard Gere and Kevin Spacey among others (apparently while Hanks was island-bound), it should come as no surprise.

Although I enjoy Tom Hanks' acting, I wasn't at all sure that he could carry the movie given what I'd heard about it, and his promotional appearances and interviews didn't quell my misgivings.  But I'm pleased to report that I was totally won over.  Quite simply, this is Hollywood at its best.  Although it dips rather expectedly into a bit of the sentimentality of Forest Gump in the final few minutes, all involved can be forgiven on the strength of the rest of the film.  That Hanks lost the Oscar for best actor to Russell Crowe of Gladiator is only proof that the Oscars are devoid of whatever artistic integrity they might once have had.  Hanks, in his role as Chuck Noland, is superb in this film.  I was surprised that critics and reviewers haven't made more of what I saw to be the real core of the film--the drama of Noland's return.  While watching Noland (the name can't be coincidental!) surviving through ingenuity on his island was fascinating, the story's emotional heart is played out upon his return, when he finds out he's been cast away by his fiancee.  The depiction of the deeply conflicted couple trapped in a horrible situation between love and responsibility was completely convincing.  Most highly recommended.",991785600,34,1285,4.773755656108597
1287510,5,B00003CXRO,"""Cast Away"" being Passed over by the Oscar's is one of the Biggest Travesty's in Film History. The Acting, Directing and Production are all Perfectly Pulled off and it manages the Difficult task of pleasing Critics and Audiences. Tom Hanks gives the Powerhouse Performance we All Expected him to and Robert Zemeckis uses All of his Skills to pull off this Monumental Achievement. Even with our Raised Expectations, the film Still manages to give us Everything we Expected And More.
Unless you yourself have been Cast Away on an Island for 3 years, you'll know the films story, so I'll keep my Plot Synopsis short. Tom Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a FedEx employee whose plane goes down in a storm and he is washed up on the shore of a remote Island... Which becomes his home for 4 Long Years. ""Cast Away"" chronicles his Survival, his battles with Starvation, Loneliness and Madness, and finally his Eventual Rescue.
There was never a Doubt in the Cinema-going Publics minds that Hanks could pull this role off, his On-Screen Transformation is Truly Something to Behold. The whole film Rests on his sole performance, which made him the Obvious (and Only) choice, I doubt the film would have been given the Green Light had he not been involved. He makes us Feel Every Emotion he faces, he Mesmerizes us with his Traumatised Expressions, and he makes the 143-minute running time feel like an even hour. The Supporting cast have Precious-little time to make an Impression, and not One of them Waste that time. Helen Hunt goes through quite a Transformation too as Chuck's Fianc, but hers is shown mainly through Facial expression and Body Language. Like Hanks, she Convincingly Conveys to us what She's been through as well, which is a Hell of a lot. Nick Searcy is a Standout as Stan, a Friend of Chucks. His couple of scenes with Hanks are very Heartfelt ones, Sentimental while also very Real. They are also Spectacularly Acted ones, like every other scene in the film.
The Screenplay is a Brilliant one, getting Maximum Emotion Impact out of a Situation that Is a tough one to film, but with Zemeckis behind the camera, the filming is in Wonderful Hands. Zemeckis uses Startling Camerawork and Brilliant use of Sounds and Silence to create this Landmark film, in my opinion; he is one of the Best Directors Working Today.

In fact, with a little more help from the rest of the cast, this movie could have been phenomenal.  Anyways, a quick breakdown of the plot is that Tom Hanks, a FedEx manager whose life is based around a busy schedule that takes him all over the world, is marooned on a deserted island for several years after his plane crashed (a very frightening crash at that) somewhere in the pacific ocean.  Hanks's time on the island is where he truly shines.  Not many actors can make you believe that man could actually cry at losing his volleyball.  I will not go into detail about his time there as it is so entertaining in every way, however after he escapes from the island (yes, we all knew he would) he comes home to find his old girlfriend remarried.  A little better script towards the end of the movie would have made such a difference in turning a very good movie into a great movie.  Helen Hunt is given a somewhat thankless role, but is believable enough to at least make something happen.

One other key thing that no other reviewer here has pointed out to my knowledge is Loyalty.  The part in the movie I am speaking about is at near the end of the movie when Hanks's true love (PLAYED BY HELEN HUNT) remains loyal to her new husband and children.  HOW ADMIRABLE!!!  The last thing I loved about the show is when Tom Hanks explained that sometimes all that you can do to keep going in life when all the chips are down is to simply keep breathing, and take one day at a time.  THAT IS SO TRUE!! DON'T YOU THINK?  The only thing I would have added to the show if I were the director is that I would have instead of Hanks loving a volleyball that could not love him back, I would have had him draw closer to God, who can AND WOULD HAVE give him guidance, hope, and love beyond measure!

""Cast Away"" takes on a compelling theme: one human being alone, stripped of the comforts of civilization, and forced to survive in a sometimes hostile natural environment. In much of the film, Hanks is the only human character onscreen; fortunately, the filmmakers hit on an excellent device to provide Hanks with an opportunity to speak some dialogue.
Hanks received an Oscar nomination for his performance, and he makes the film worth watching. It is fascinating to watch his character's ingenuity at coping with this situation. The tropical locale is excellently shot; the island becomes as much a ""character"" in the film as does Hanks' castaway.
The film as a whole is not entirely satisfying. This may have to do with the overall structure of the narrative, which struck me as somewhat episodic, and lacking in payoff. Nevertheless, ""Cast Away"" is well worth watching.",990576000,4,1052,5.122093023255814

Hanks is, hanktastic and didn't let me down at all, who else in holliwood could they throw onto an island and say 'go ahead to your thing', there was a 2001 esque quality about a wonderful 30 minutes in which hanks doesnt say a word, and in some ways the arrival of wilson, his only friend - a volley ball is a shame.

Highlights are plentiful if you let yourself get involved, dreamworks once again work their magic, surely the biggest power in holliwood at the moment?! The best plane crash in the history of cinema, i hope it's as good on the small screen!

1287630,5,B00003CXRO,"When I first heard about Castaway, a Tom Hanks/Robert Zemeckis collaboration, I expected something like Robinson Crusoe. Due to the Holywood nature of the project I also expected wild adventure scenes and the movie to be a generally pleasant affair. This however is a trap that I think a lot of other people fell into as well which may have left a lot of viewers feeling short changed.
The simple fact is, Castaway is a very depressing movie. Although many people wanted adventure on a tropical island, it would be foolish to write this off as anything other than a great film. The movie is divided up into three seperate parts. The first sees Hanks, a frantic fedex courier,  travelling all around the world in an attempt to keep the mail system up to speed. Part two, he crashes in the pacific ocean. This, incidentally is the most terrifying plane crash scene which you will ever see and is likely to go through your mind the next time you go on vacation.  Anyway, Hanks the sole survivor is marooned on a tropical island and over four years lives a lonely existence. His only connection to civilization is a volleyball.  Lastly, Hanks returns home only to find his wife remarried.
It is hard to nail down exactly what is good about Castaway because the movie cannot really be broken up into little scenes and scrutinized. The movie works incredibly well as a mood piece and establishes a huge sense of desolation and loneliness. Hanks puts in a subtle performance that for the most part relies on body language rather than expansive monologues. The film is also very real which definitley helps add to the pervading sense of loss. There are no Holywood touches to Hanks' survival, he lights his own fires (after three days of trying), bleeds when he steps on a reef and doesn't have batteries that last in his flashlight for four years. Unlike other stranded in nature films like ""The Edge,"" where Anthony Hopkins and Alec Baldwin are seen sporting bear coats right after killing a bear with a stick, Castaway is about as real to life as you can imagine.
There are of course some flaws. The whole third act is a dissapointment. Throughout the entire film Hanks does a great job so it is a shame to see him reverting to his usual ""I have to get home to my wife"" type of character taht he has done about three million times before. Helen Hunt is pretty poor as well, her only purpose seems to be to taunt Hanks by chasing him down in the rain to only kiss him once and then go back to her new husband. These are minor quibbles to another wise great movie. Castway is real and the sense of desperation and loneliness it creates is uncommon in movies of this scope.

I'm sorry, but the abilty to gain and then shed 30 lbs in the timespan of a movie shoot does not make a good performance.
Plus, I felt like I was watching the abridged version of a movie. He's on the island, he figures out how to do some stuff and then, BAM, it's four years later. Later on, it skips over something else that seems to me would be essential to the story if, indeed, it had one.
And the volleyball thing? PLEASE. Zemeckis tried to makes us feel emotions for an inanimate object and I, for one, felt insulted.

1287633,4,B00003CXRO,"Magnificent film, and for one chief reason: Tom Hanks. Only Hanks could mesmerize an audience for 70-plus minutes all by himself. Only Hanks could pull it off: Stranded on a deserted island with nothing but sand, coconuts and FedEx packages to see him through. Only Hanks could shed pound after pound of body fat, and grow inch after inch of beard to look the part.
The truth is, this is not a story about being on an island. Rather, it is a case study in reclamation, in finding your niche all over again. Put it this way: We've all come home from long vacations, and then dragged ourselves back to the grind of every day life. It's that sublime emotion that stirs in your gut whenever you see your friends and co-workers for the first time after not having seen them in a while. This feeling of adjustment, of 'coming home' is Cast Away. Hanks portrays it well, and the superb, simplistic direction by Robert Zemekis gives it gravity.
In short, whatever you thought you might have heard or read about 'Cast Away,' chuck it out the airplane window... See the movie; view it by yourself on one of those rainy, snuggly nights, and you'll find yourself seeking 'home,' wherever that may be.",989366400,,1188,4.582159624413146
1287634,5,B00003CXRO,"""Cast Away"" is one of those all-too rare, brilliant films that is perfectly structured, perfectly conceived, and perfectly acted. In many ways, it is like a three act play, or three short movies. The first act introduces the main character and shows his life up until his being stranded on a desert island. The second act, the major bulk of the film, is a tour de force, one man character piece about the struggles to survive all by oneself.  To craft a film in which most of the action involves one actor by himself for around an hour or more of screen time, and make it absorbing, insightful, and never boring is an amazing achievement, one which can be attributed to the great direction of Robert Zemeckis and the wonderful performance by Tom Hanks, who manages to make his character both an everyman and three-dimensional, living, breathing person. It is in this second act that we really learn about this man. By seeing every creature comfort he has grown up with instantly snatched away from him, and watching a modern man have to utilize talents of survival he didn't even know he had, we the audience are rewarded with the experience of seeing a character closer than usually happens in film. The third act is the resolution: what happens when this man who has had to live a primitive lifestyle, returns to the modern world. The amazing thing is, not much has changed in terms of technology or so forth (therefore it is not a Rip Van Winkle type tale). Instead, he has changed. Watch this movie for one of the most fascinating character portrayals in recent film history,and for the great performance by Tom Hanks. Rarely does a movie so brilliantly set up a life for a character, take it away from him in a flash, thus forcing him to create a new life for himself, and then see the results when he is returned to the old one, forever now a changed man. Notice that the title is not ""Castaway,"" the noun, but the verb ""cast away,"" giving the movie much richer, symbolic levels of meaning than what the former would have been.",989366400,,2033,4.5698630136986305
1287705,4,B00003CXRO,"I don't think that i've ever seen a film quite like this one.  And it's a real tribute to both Zemeckis and Hanks that this particular film was so effective.
First i've gotta talk about the ending since there seems to be so many different opinions about it.  In my mind the ending was very straightforward.  Hanks was at a crossroads (in his life).  To me he had definitively ended up deciding in which direction he would go despite the fact that the film ends without him embarking on his journey.  The last direction that he looked is the direction he intends to pursue.  I personally thought that it was a great ending.
Zemeckis is to be commended since visually and graphically the film was stunning.  That includes the crash, dental work, casting off, and for me the most emotional moment of the entire film is when the ship appears.  I did not think, going in, that I could be thoroughly engaged and entertained by one man's experience on a deserted island.
I could have done without all the FedEx stuff in the beginning.  Although I realize that it was all done to show how time conscious that Hanks' character was.  To me it seemed kinda like overkill.
Thoroughly enjoyable.",989193600,,1182,4.585714285714285
1287706,5,B00003CXRO,"Starting right off we see Tom Hanks rushed and chaotic life come reeling out. This opening gives us just enough time to feel somewhat sypathetic for Helen Hunt, who plays Tom Hanks' girlfriend.  The real meat of the movie is of course Tom Hanks getting stranded, which happens when his plane ends up crashing.  The plane scene really stands out as being so incredibley intense and almost reaching the point of horrific that it stands alone among any other plane disasters. I won't give away too much about the majority of the movie, but if you haven't seen it yet...see it!  This movie is so fresh and well done that by the end of the movie you'll end up feeling sypathetic for a volleyball!  The very ending is my only gripe...with a story like this it just seemed difficult to find a descent ending, and have a feeling that things have wrapped up.  Although I must praise the writer of the script for not going the easy way out with a typical ""Hollwood Movie"" ending.  Overall, this is a must for any movie fan looking for an intense, dramatic, and well acted movie about man kind's will for survival.",988588800,,1103,4.517587939698492
1287707,2,B00003CXRO,"First impressions last. The films beginning is long, not to mention cheesy. We first meet Chuck, our hapless workaholic FedEx employee, in Moscow where he's ranting and raving about time usage. Later we meet Helen Hunt, who's his equally busy girlfriend. Over Christmas [or somewhere around it], Chuck is called away for some emergency work. Before he leaves, Helen gives him a watch. In case the viewer hadn't picked up on it, the importance, or rather unimportance, of time is pounded into us from then on. This was one factor that made me angry about the film: it seems to assume the viewer is lacking the vital brain cells needed to pick up on plot elements.
After we wade our way through the drawn out opening, Chuck's plane takes a dive, and he finds himself stranded on an island. This is where the heart of the film lies. The whole point of it. So why, I ask, do the start and finish take up just as much time? Anyway, we watch as Chucky Boy moves from the stages of hope, to anger, to acceptance, and eventually to total desperation. In this desperation he creates a friend for himself, a ball named Wilson. Sounds ridiculous, and I suppose it is, but you can sympathise. You don't laugh at a grown man having a discussion with a ball. This is the mark of good story telling.
But, saddly, the ending doesn't follow through. It takes too long, and suddenly the walls seem fairly appealing. You might find yourself creating your own friend, naming him Alfredo, and discussing what it's like back out in the world.
The directing for the island parts is impressive, even poetic. Hanks gives a solid performance, but it could have been a bit more subtle. In fact, the whole film could have been.
The DVD looks to be loaded, so if you truly loved this movie, go for it. If you have yet to see it, I strongly suggest you rent it first.",987897600,5,1837,4.486567164179104

Not one word (as for example, in Gilligan's Island).  Hanks is ""cast away"" from society.  How he deals with it, and how he tries to deal with being thrust back into society, are the focal points of the film.  It was a film that I thought about over and over in the weeks after seeing it.  It is a Greek tragedy.  Perhaps critics were looking for another ""Sleepless in Seattle"".  This film is not it.  There is much criticism regarding the ending.  I confess that I fail to see what's wrong with the ending.  I believe it is realistic.  Perhaps people want a traditional Hollywood ""happy"" ending.  Life's not like that.  Some viewer's have also picked nits over silly details - like the fact that Hank's fingernails are too nicely manicured for a man stranded on an island for 5 years.  Sheesh!  Since when did a lack of realism in movies ever bother anyone?  I also give Hanks and Zemeckis kudos for not relying on swearing, nudity, sex, or any other modern gimmick which movie makers use to compensate for a lack of plot and acting.",986428800,7,1193,4.36986301369863

Castaway will no doubt become a classic template for those pressing the 3 Act structure of Hollywood narrative. Act 1 is unexpectedly clumsy, with pointless heavy-handed Russian sequences and Hunt/Hanks interplay which suggests not so much love as the camaraderie born of having to speak such lousy dialogue. But Act 1 is undoubtedly saved by the stunning crash sequence. Act 2 is no fun at all. Essentially, it is a long chain of 'oooo, that's clever!' moments, as Hanks solves various survival problems in an amusing way. While talking to himself. Or to Wilson. Act 2 goes on forever, as Syd Field says it should. Act 3 caps a lousy film with a stunningly uncomfortable conclusion, breaking all the rules of formula in precisely the wrong places. Of course, no-one will care, and Cast Away is going to be huge in the UK, as it has been in the US. But prepare not to be enchanted.",986256000,2,1017,4.884393063583815

Nothing.  You carry on and probably never learn unless your plane goes down in the middle of nowhere and you wash up alone on a small deserted island with little chance of being spotted.

That's what the whole story is about.  While the events are tragic and the character comes back to a changed and sad life (i.e., I believe he was believed dead for over 10 years so everyone else carried on with his life), it's a chance for rebirth.

Definitely worth checking out.  Good photography and pretty interesting even if Tom Hanks had few ""people"" to speak to on the island.  Look for how he ends up building his boat to try and get off the island.  Clever or lucky?

The acting is excellent, of course - especially when you've got the talent-likes of Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt in the same movie. Although I don't agree with most of the people's reviews - I thought Tom Hanks played his role very well and seemed very realistic. Sure, he's famous - but aren't a lot of actors are? And Helen Hunt was great, too. But from the time Tom Hanks was left on the island really did seem to take forever. And who knows? This film does have a point and could be pretty useful...somebody could get stranded on an island all alone out in the middle of the ocean any day, and wouldn't it be helpful to know how to survive it by seeing this film?

This is the perfect movie about someone stranded on an island. Excellent acting by everyone (Tom Hanks, Helen Hunt et al), excellent directing (Robert Zemeckis), excellent writing (William Broyles Jr.), and excellent scenery make for a perfect movie. It doesn't quite rank with Zemeckis' ""Forrest Gump,"" but it is very close.",983836800,4,472,5.142857142857143
1287797,2,B00003CXRO,"But that's no surprise -- it's a Zemeckis picture!  This is, after all, the guy who gave us  *Forrest Gump*  with all its dumbed-down philosophy -- opium for the masses.  Zemeckis does it again, but this time it's not so much a philosophical treatise  (""Don't Give Up Hope""  seems to be the astoundingly original thought at work here)  as it is a messy ladling, gravy-like, of self-importance over all the movie's particulars.  The Amazon reviewer correctly observes that  *Cast Away*  is three movies in one . . . and that's two movies too many.  We're given a 30-minute prelude  (I'm not exaggerating) establishing that Tom Hanks works for Fed-Ex and has a fiancee.  Why this takes a half-hour is beyond me -- only arrogance and an unlimited budget can explain it.  Finally we get to the plane crash over the ocean.  We know it's coming and have been waiting -- with increasing impatience -- for it.  I must say that it's shot spectacularly, and is frankly the prime justification in my mind for giving  *Cast Away*  two stars instead of one.  But here again, this sequence's very success can explained by, again, arrogance and an unlimited budget.
Okey-doke; now to the  ""stranded-on-a-deserted-island""  movie.  We watch Tom Hanks spearing fish, building fires  (I swear that FIFTEEN MINUTES of the film is spent on this alone), constructing a leafy hut, learning how to crack open a coconut, learning which crabs to eat, learning how to best use the assorted debris from the plane-crash which gradually beaches on the island, et cetera, et al.  In a word:  BORING.  Especially when you consider that the guy's gonna get off the island anyway, the  ""big secret""  having been revealed in the trailers that ran for what seemed like months before the film's release.  Zemeckis assumes we'll put up with all this, and judging from the box receipts and the positive reviews, he assumes rightly.  This is the unhappy result of arrogance and an unlimited budget.
And finally, we get to Movie #3.  Well, unlike Zemeckis, I actually don't want to spoil the resolution of the plot for you, hoping that you may have missed the all-revealing trailer.  Needless to say, arrogance and an unlimited budget stretch things out much longer than necessary.  Essentially, we have a 2 1/2-hour movie that shoud've been no longer than 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Because of the self-importance dripping off every shot  (and LENGTHENING every shot), *Cast Away*  comes across every bit as pretentious as  *Forrest Gump*, but with even less justification.  I almost regret the 2-star review I gave Zemeckis'  earlier 2000 effort, *What Lies Beneath* -- that movie was downright fast and fun compared to this one, which, if I may use a simile, is like Robinson Crusoe in cement boots walking on thick sand.",983404800,5,2780,4.858974358974359
1287798,5,B00003CXRO,"Ok, may'be the title is a little overstated, but out of almost every movie that I heard of this winter, I was looking forward to this one.  Since I was 5, Robert Zemeckis has been one of my favorite directors, and Hanks has been steadily gaining on my popularity chart.  This film will really put his acting skills to the benefit of all.
Tom Hanks plays Chuck Noland (break down that last name for the joke), a FedEx employee who demands precision and on the clock time delivery.  Anything less to Chuck, and FedEx becomes the US Postal service.  Even through all this, Chuck still tries to maintai his relationship with his Memphis, Tennessee girlfriend Kellie (Helen Hunt).  Chuck completes his latest route, and just when it seems like Christmas and New Years will be a time of peace, Chuck is called in to supervise a flight to Asia.  However, once over the Pacific, turbulance and more trouble causes a terrifying plane crash, of which Chuck soon finds himself ""cast away"" on an island.  This wouldn't sound so bad, except that the waves coming in prevent Chuck from escaping, and there is no sign of life.
Once on the island, Hanks gives us an incredible role, playing Chuck almost entirely through pantomime and body movement.  Chuck does not feel the need to talk only if it is important.  In other words, he is not the possibly gung ho survivor.  Once realizing his fate, Chuck finds several FedEx packages washed up.  Inside them he finds several items he uses to stay alive.  To keep his sanity through loneliness, he takes a Volleyball, smears itn with blood fro a wound of his, and names it ""Wilson.""  The interaction between Hanks and Wilson is great, with Hanks talking AND responding to Wilson.
Robert Zemeckis keeps the camera on Hanks form teh minute the doors blow open on the plane, all through the island.  We are the invisible man, walking next to Chuck on the island.  Alan Silvestri's score plays well, considering there is one universal theme throughout the entire film.  The theme ties everything together, and the minimal use of dialogue and music helps us beleive in chucks plight (we also hear what he hears, the waves, the wind, and such).

1287799,5,B00003CXRO,"My friend A.M. recommended this movie to me and I thought this would just be another bad movie of the year 2000. But I just finished watching this movie in theaters about an hour ago and WOW, I was completly amazed!!! (review next, storyline after the space). The screenplay is an excellent one that packs plenty of jokes to keep you laughing throughout a good portion of the movie. Beyond jokes, this movie keeps you constantly on the edge of you seats trying to guess whats gonna happen next from the airplane crashing, how he'll survive on the island, and especially what will be of him & Kelly when he comes back. Tom Hank's preformance was incredible by keeping it real and emotional with that characteristic Tom Hanks touch. The same goes for Helen Hunt whose excellent perfermance being Kelly, Chuck's girlfriend, gave this movie the romantic lighting that only a good female actress can bring. And most of all, unlike other bad movies this year, all the great things about a movie, the wonderful acting, the suspense, the humor, excitement, & complete enraping of the viewer flows from beginning to end at exactly the right times and not just a couple of scenes. The only minor problem I have with this movie is that it never answers our ? of what will happen to Chuck's life now that he's back alive from the island especially with his love life.
 Its a story about Chuck, a man that works for Fedex, who has to leave for an air flight delivery right before Christmas, but he promises his girlfriend, Kelly, that he'll be home by New Years. Little does he know that after he gets out of the car and goes to the plane with his Christmas present of a gold pocket watch with Kelly's picture in it, that he will not return home to Memphis in a long time. Instead his plane crash lands somewhere in the pacific with him as the only survivor who is fortunate enough to be pushed by the waves to be on an island. From that he finds all sorts of ingenious ways to survive for a long long long long time from island resources and a few FEDEX packages (not giving the details away). When Chuck later did get back to Memphis (how-you gotta see it to believe it) he'll find that he's got his job at FEDEX back but things are a bit different especially his girlfriend Kelly.

Tom Hanks has once more given a performance that will literally touch your soul. Even though I had not been that excited by the trailer, when the movie ended I was left speechless. It is true that on those rare occasions that Hollywood tries it can still create magic. Furthermore, what else can I say but the fact that Tom Hanks can hold a film together all by himself.

1287865,5,B00003CXRO,"As someone actively involved in a lot of theatre work, I see a lot of good drama.  Cast Away beats everything that I've seen hands down.  The acting is absolutely incredible, the setting spell bounding, and the script amazing.  The director and writer of this movie thought out almost every detail possible.  The staging that goes on on the island provides the perfect blend of humor, pain, drama, sadness, and reality.
Tom Hanks is at his peak in this movie.  The fact that any actor can carry on a monologue for more than an hour is a testament to his skill, but his interaction with himself (via ""Wilson"", the ill-fated volleyball) transforms what might have been a boring series of ramblings into a passionate, believable exchange.
To me, the best part of this movie is the ending.  Although many would disagree with me, breaking the convention was a perfect thing to do.  Although it is somewhat disappointing that we do not get to see the reception of the last package, it is more than made up for by the fact that the package gives Hanks something to live for...the safe return of the parcel...and all the attention is directed towards that, rather than the predictable ""Knight in Shining Armor"" ending.
This movie is filled with psychological themes, powerful acting, and a passionate plot.  The ending touches base with real life, and doesn't beat around the bush.  The reality is, and no one can ever deny this, is that life is not all that great.  Actually, most of the time it just plain sucks.  Cast Away leaves no doubts that this is so, and as such has a much greater impact on the viewer than almost any other movie.
Most importantly, especially in a world filled with poorly written, tasteless films, Cast Away actually makes you think.  This movie might not leave you laughing or crying for days -- but it will, on the other hand, leave you thinking...for months.  I cannot recommend this movie more -- the cast and crew deserve full applause for this movie.",980467200,7,1976,4.676300578034682
1287866,4,B00003CXRO,"I admire Tom Hanks as an actor because he doesn't always play the conventional roles, and is willing to go the extra mile to try out different things.  Here he is, playing another role, in which, for most of the picture, he has to play to the camera by himself, as he is stranded on an island by himself.  Is he up to the challenge?  I think he was and his performance is mostly what saves this picture.
 I've talked to some people who thought the movie was boring, that there wasn't enough going on, and they found the island scenes boring.  Too much quiet, there's not even any music playing or anything, I've heard them complain.  I don't really know what they expected from a movie about a man who is stranded on an island, with no sign of life except for trees all around him.  Since when did we become so dependent on music in movies telling us how we should feel, or feel the need for eye candy popping out every minute to enjoy ourselves at a movie.  The basic idea is for us to feel as Tom Hanks' character does, stranded, and alone.  To empathize with him, and even feel a sense of pity for him as he rambles around at the beginning, desperately calling for someone, anyone, who might hear him.  For myself, I could have done with more of the island scenes, and less of some of the other scenes.
 In particular, I would have liked to have seen some of the scenes in between the time he learns to make a fire without matches, and the four years later blurb.  It would have been interesting, at least I think so, to have seen him to start to become proficient at catching fish, and learning how to live on his own.  But of course, that was also the time that he begins losing weight, subsiding on a mostly fish and coconut diet.  So, I guess they really didn't want to show us too much because Tom Hanks was actually working on losing weight himself so we could see the difference in him during that four year span.
Some people also felt that he was losing his grip by painting a face on a volleyball, and talking to it.  On the contrary, I felt that by doing this, he was trying to preserve his sanity.  Here was a man who was constantly on the go, always dealing with people, and now he's by himself, without a soul to talk to.  The solitude would have driven him crazy in no time if he hadn't found an outlet, and Wilson, which he named the volleyball, was that outlet.  Watch the scene where he throws Wilson away, and then his near desperation in going out to retrieve it, scared to be by himself again, and needing that outlet to remain sane.
 The end parts of the movie are the weakest ones, especially the poorly done falsely feeling uplifting moment that seems to have been tacked onto the movie at the last moment to keep people from feeling too depressed for Tom Hanks.  Yes, he lost the woman he had been in love with before this whole thing started, but he had been gone for four years, and life does go on.  Besides, consider this:  Whom did he really seem more upset about losing, the woman he had been in love with four years ago, or Wilson, whom he cried and screamed over losing.

His Xmas 1995 dinner is interrupted when work calls him away to supervise a flight to Malaysia. He promises his girlfriend Kelly that he'll be right back. He doesn't realize he's making a promise he can't keep.

While passing over the Pacific his plane enters a storm and ditches into the ocean, very violently. Chuck is the only survivor of the flight and manages to escape into the water with a life raft, but loses the radio transmitter in the process. When morning breaks he discovers that he has washed-up on an uninhabited island. Rescue does not come, and Chuck must figure out how to survive while torturing himself with memories of Kelly.

In an annoying cop-out, the film then jumps to Four Years Later where Chuck has reverted to a cave-man appearance. He's not a happy man, but his outlook changes when a steel section of a port-a-john washes up on the beach. Using a analemma he has etched onto a cave wall, Chuck is STILL keeping track of time and plans an escape from the island using the sheet of steel as a sail for his rickety raft to freedom.

Cast Away (not Castaway) has lovely sound design and photography (why Zemeckis chose to shoot it in 1.85:1 is rather odd though, as many shots seem uncomfortably tight), and really immerses you in the threatening silence of the island. It actually reminds me a lot of the video game Myst in that respect. But the film is book-ended by boredom. The only part I ever really watch is the middle section on the island. Skipping over Chuck's 4-year transformation from mailman to caveman was bad enough, but once he eventually makes his escape from the island the movie skips over the 4-weeks of his reintroduction to society, which is yet another cop-out.

Zemeckis attempts far too much ambiguity with Cast Away. It's usually a sign of a writer/director attempting to cover-up failings with mystery, but Cast Away is a better script than that and it comes across as just being pretentious. The middle section of the film is intriguing. The non-island scenes haven't got a leg to stand on.",979430400,16,2189,4.648578811369509
1287950,3,B00003CXRO,"I won't even summarize the plot, I'm sure 90% of America has seen the movie.  When I went to see this, I was expecting a pretty typical film that would pass the time.  I didn't get a whole lot more than that, but it wasn't bogged down with cliches.  I think the movie would have benefited more from going deeper into the feelings of loneliness that, I assume, comes with being stranded on a desert island.  As far as ""night-out-with-friends-entertainment"" goes, it isn't bad.  One would think that a movie with just a man by himself would get boring, but thanks to somewhat-decent directing, the pace never becomes dull.  This movie probably won't change your life or inspire generations of knock-offs, but it won't bore any wise person with tired formulas.",979171200,3,757,4.740458015267175
1287951,4,B00003CXRO,"We live in a world in which the latest technology is taken for granted on a daily basis, and the ""Fast Food Generation"" is in charge; everything has to be done yesterday, and there's literally not enough hours in a day to do what ""must"" be done.  In ""Cast Away,"" directed by Robert Zemeckis, a man who has bought into all of the above suddenly finds himself plucked from it-- seemingly at random-- and given something new to ponder:  Life.  Life, in it's most basic and primitive form; where all he has for survival are his two hands, his wits, and whatever nature, in all her glory, can provide.  Tom Hanks is Chuck Noland, a supervisor for Fed-Ex who lives and dies by the clock; a world traveler whose time at home and with loved ones is calculated to the minute.  On Christmas, he exchanges gifts with his intended, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt), in the car before boarding yet another flight that will spirit him away to oversee the job in yet another city, another country.  But this time, somewhere over the ocean, elemental forces take charge, his plane is forced to ditch in the sea, and Noland's life-- in a few seconds-- is changed forever.  He survives, only to be washed ashore on a small, uninhabited island in the middle of nowhere, where he must confront Time-- and himself-- as never before.  Though comparisons to ""Robinson Crusoe"" may spring to mind immediately, tuck them away in some back pocket of your memory, because what Zemeckis and Hanks give you here is anything but that.  You learn enough about Noland and Kelly during the time leading up to the ill-fated flight, that by the time Noland lands on the island you know who this man is, what makes him tick, and also about the life and the love he leaves behind and what it will mean to them both.  And knowing what you do, his time on the island becomes more than just a handbook for survival; it's an intimate portrait of a man coming to terms with himself and learning the hard way-- with the core of his existence, the clock, negated-- what it is that really matters in life.  Among the invaluable lessons he learns is that, indeed, no man is an island; for he sorely lacks the one thing nature cannot provide:  Companionship.  Hanks gives a tremendously subtle, yet powerful performance as Noland; if there is any doubt, consider the fact that he carries the film for more than an hour by himself without allowing the tension or the drama to lag.  Zemeckis, of course, must be given credit for keeping it all on task, including what his star is doing, and together they make it riveting drama that keeps the viewer enthralled, not only by what is happening in the present, but by maintaining a sense of anticipation; that something is just around the corner, about to happen.  The real strength of the film is in the way it's presented, and the way Hanks so successfully connects with the audience to create the empathy that allows the viewer to know what it would feel like to be in his place; understanding that sudden regard for all the things that are taken for granted every day:  The simple creature comforts; a book of matches; water; having someone to share a laugh with.  And most importantly, knowing that alternating sense of hope and despair Noland must live with without respite.  A message so succinctly driven home and so well done that it leaves you with a real sense of awe.  The metaphor of a man at the crossroads of his life has been done many times before, but never like this; with a nod to Zemeckis and Hanks, there is a purity to their treatment of the aforementioned theme with this film that is unparalleled.  The supporting cast includes Nick Searcy (Stan), Lari White (Bettina) and Geoffrey Blake (Maynard Graham), all of whom add so much to the success of this film.  But the performance that really ties it all together is given by the gifted Helen Hunt, who with a limited amount of screen time makes Kelly a heart-felt, memorable character.  It's an exceptional performance that is worthy of an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress.  ""Cast Away"" is an engrossing film that-- make no mistake-- is about so much more than how a guy survives on a deserted island; it's about enlightenment, and taking stock of the things that matter before it's too late.  A wake-up call, one could say, for a generation mired in technology, and governed by Time.",978998400,8,4361,4.604651162790698
1287952,4,B00003CXRO,"Robert Zemeckis is an extraordinarily compelling filmmaker, and he knows when to keep things seemingly simple.  Tom Hanks again proves his acting chops in this very imaginative psychological adventure tale; from the moment he is in the plane until he is rescued, this is one magnetically charged movie, and in ways you might not expect.  The plane crash itself jolts your senses; it is that kind of big-screen sequence in which you lose all sense of time and place and are in the movie; Cast Away remains that way throughout the entire sequence on the island.  The ocean waves themselves become characters, and their incessant pounding on the surf takes on a horrific quality, even in its natural beauty. But as sure-footed as this movie is when Tom is ""cast away"", it is disheartening to report that the final half hour or so, featuring an uninteresting Helen Hunt, robs us of the very buildup we've been mesmerized by for over 90 minutes.  And the bookend plot device simply does not give us what we want after having endured so much.  Still, you will not likely see a more creatively charged big-budget movie this season, nor a performance as riveting at Hanks'.  The device of Wilson the volleyball as Hanks' only ""friend"" is brilliantly executed, with an emotional payoff as surprising as it is deftly handled.",978998400,,1315,4.822222222222222
1287953,3,B00003CXRO,"Boy, this movie was a disapointment. I guess I am so accustomed to Tom Hanks and his association with great films, that when one comes along that is just good, it sort of ruins it for me.
Make no mistake about it, this is an OK film. Hanks performance is very good and will probably bring him another Academy Award Nomination, (He will not win) but there is something that just doesn't work here. I can't put my finger on it.
The movie begins with a promising premise. Gun-Ho FedEx executive so caught up in his work that he dosen't have time for his family or his girlfriend, survives a horrendous plane crash, only to be marooed on a deserted island. He now has to abandon the only thing he has ever depended on, time, and is thrown headlong into the ordeal of trying to survive.
The scenes on the island for some reason never really gave me the feeling of complete isolation that you would expect from being marooned and alone. And even though I liked the astonishing physical and emotional transformation of Hanks over the course of the story, it is overshadowed by the unexpected events that lead up to a predictable Hollywood ending.
I recommend that you go see it, but I'll bet you will leave the theatre feeling the same way so many people I have talked to after seeing this movie...unsatisfyed.",978652800,6,1303,4.52542372881356

This is an amazing film with superior acting and directing and equally incredible special effects.  This is a must see for everyone in search of a great film.  A story of struggle and hope.

Hanks does a superb job and the physical transformation he goes through is simply stunning.  I thought only DeNiro could make his body change that much!

1287956,2,B00003CXRO,"In my opinion Cast Away is one of the biggest films of the year 2000 that failed the most. A lot of effort was put into this film done by Robert Zemeckis and his crew but it simply didn't pay off. The film most likely will not hold your attention and you will get very fidgeity during the end.
 The whole plot was pretty dumb and non-original too. ... Tom Hanks did a fair job of acting but I don't think that he should earn any award for his performance in this film. If you would like to watch Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for nearly two hours, this movie is for you.
 The only reason the movie earned 2 stars from me is because I thought that the action sequences on the Fed Ex plane were superb. So, if you know you will like to see Tom kill fish and talk to a volleyball for most of the film, this is for you.
P.S.- When I say he talks to a volleyball I mean it. It is another way that he is able to stay alive. His friend ""Wilson"" is supposedley another strength that keeps him alive.",978307200,,1000,3.970149253731343
1288017,4,B00003CXRO,"While the ending works just fine for me and is very clear and actually very satisfying, it was what was left out that bothered me - scenes either cut or never shot that would have provided for smoother transitions and understanding.  The ""explosion"" on the plane was unclear, perhaps meant to convey the confusion of Hank's character at the moment.  When Hunt's character explains the specifics of his crash towards the end of the movie, by then the viewer has taken his thoughts away from the movie more than necessary to ponder confusing actions such as the crash; also Hank's ""apologies"" at the end, when clearly it's hardly his fault; the painting of the design on the fed-ex box on the porta-potty door; the ""hanging"" that apparently happens in year ""3,"" totally unclear, a scene which would have played out effectively had it been shown, and only bogged the movie down in confusing allusions until, once again, made clear in dialogue towards the end of the movie.  Action is always preferable to dialogue, and I don't know why Zemeckis and gang chose to eliminate visuals in favor of dialogue in many scenes.  Interactions of the characters frequently ring false, as mentioned in one of the first reviews above.  A conversation or scene should have been added in the beginning where Hunt begs Hanks to not board the plane, to stay this one time, and he insists on going, etc.  Instead it's all business as usual, so that when at the end, Hanks apologizes saying ""I shouldn't have gotten on that plane,"" it doesn't follow.  Why aren't his friends showing more amazement at his survival, why aren't they more proud of him, why are they ""accepting"" his apologies???
Regardless, the movie definitely held my interest, is visually fascinating, effectively portrays the tenacity of life, and is mostly well-done.  A little more objective work on the dialogue would have helped.  I would like to see a longer version some day, to see what was cut out, if anything...

But then you can't stop thinking about the rest of the movie, the good parts (like Titanic). The beginning was slow... you're thinking, crash the plane already! The crash scene was very exciting on the big screen. Much better than any I have ever seen. I thought the island part would be boring but it's actually the highlight of the film. His ingenious ways of using fed ex packages was neat, and his failed attemps to get of the island make your heart ache. But when he finally does get off the island (which was ruined in the trailers) and sees his old girlfriend, the movie goes downhill. The ending is too realistic. It could have been happy! And the hope the finale offers you is not much. They should offer an alternate ending on DVD, but of course they won't. So my title pretty much sums up the film.",978220800,2,906,4.398809523809524
1288019,3,B00003CXRO,"One thing is for certain: Cast Away is an ambitious film. And the element of the filmmaker's ambition is profoundly striking, but sadly the requisite drama and forced romance is hopelessly bad. For about two-thirds of the movie, Tom Hanks is alone on an island. He is remarkably effective in this role, commanding a great level of interest despite no character interaction whatsoever (well, a little bit, kind of -- you'll see what I mean). This is a testimony for how brilliant Hanks is as an actor.
A man stuck on an island, and he must survive through his own survival faculties. It's a simple but good story requiring a straightforward exposition and an equally simple but suitably triumphant close. Unfortunately, obligatory romance and strained drama dilute this strong little plot with gratuitous dross, diminishing its ultimate impact.
Hanks is Chuck Noland, a Federal Express executive whose job requires him to fly all over the world and amend problems. While flying over the Pacific, a storm forces the plane off course before an onboard explosion cripples the craft and sends it careening into the ocean below. This scene is nerve-racking; one of the best plane crashes ever filmed. Hanks survives (obviously), and finds himself washed up on a deserted island. Here, the desperation of the situation causes the emergence of considerable canniness. At first he struggles with his predicament; he toils to call upon the basics of fire-building, shelter-building, and fishing. Watching him work is utterly engaging. It's not white-knuckle action-style intensity, but it's still completely captivating and I was quite taken by this aspect of the film. Chuck's only companion during four years (!) of solitude is the volleyball named Wilson. While it might sound silly, Hanks' incredible acting talent vicariously makes the ball an almost human figure. Wilson is indeed Chuck's only accompaniment, for he unerringly drives the focus of the film's middle portion without music or deviating scenes showing what's happening beyond his little world.
I don't want to be responsible for spoiling the ending (although the excessively revealing movie trailers have done as much already), but I will say that the ending is like a kick in the head. After Chuck's inspiring and gripping exploits on the island, his return home is met with a hokey romance sequence and a seemingly labored attempt at enlightenment. The final contrived scenes were cringe-inducing.
If I'd known what was going to take place after Chuck's rescue, I would have left the theater immediately following it and forever wondered about Chuck's reunion with his former fianc and how he would thereafter live his life. It's an above average film, and Hanks performance is solid, but I recommend that the viewer make a getaway after Chuck's rescue. Trust me.",978134400,9,2824,5.168122270742358

Tom Hanks plays the character brilliantly, with little dialouge which I did not mind.

I think this is a great film, shot with a low budget, you know Tom Hanks is not in it just for the money, the budget like I said is low, and just the atmosphere that Tom Hanks brings to the film is enough to see the film. It is greatly written, and directed with exellent visuals and of course the beautiful Fiji island.

I found myself from time to time, gripping the sides of my seat.  Especially during the fifteen minute plane crash.  Tom Hanks always picks the best of the best to be in and when his name appears you know that the movie is going to be good.  At first, I didn't think that Hanks could pull off a one man show.  And the trailers to me looked like a remake of Robinson Crusoe.  I find myself completely wrong on both counts. The story is about Hanks, who works for the FedEx company and is called out on Christmas.  After telling the love of his life,""I'll be right back"", he boards the plane.  Of course the plane crashes in the pacific halfway through the flight.  After that is when we get to see Hanks transform into a completely different person from the pudgy man that he once was.

Did Tom Hanks take this movie because he was the only actor in it and got the entire acting purse of 3 trillion dollars and all the cream filled donuts he could eat for life ? Surely, he would otherwise rather have died in the plane crash than appear in the credits of yet one more movie written and produced by People Who Have Had Their Brains Removed.
The only part of the movie I enjoyed were the last ten minutes, by which time I had escaped a more life threatening experience than Hanks's in the movie, which was actually watching it, and was at home pouring a whisky with trembling hands - boy, that was a close shave with Nothingness. Sadly the rest of the audience were too comatose to follow.
Hanks is a great actor but there is a limit to how long you can watch even him rub sticks together to make fire or talk to a basketball. Hanks's character apparently did this for four years ; it certainly felt a good deal longer. But matters worsened when he returned to the enthralling offices of Fedex and engaged in conversations which proved that if you dedicate your life to getting parcels there on time you cause yourself severe cerebral damage.
His best friend's wife has died of cancer. Hanks says ""I should have been there, I am sorry, I should have been there"". He doesn't go on to say I would have been there if I hadn't got held up by a plane crash in the Pacific Ocean and been cast away on a desert island for an eternity. His friend could at least have said, don't worry Tom I understand why you didn't make it.
Hanks returns and his beloved's new husband meets him and says ,Hi remember me I once gave you root canal treatment,and by implication, But that's nothing to what I'm going to do to you now.
He meets his beloved and she a) makes him a coffee, b) tells him she has a big mortgage, or her husband has a big mortgage, or a big something else which is why she fell for him (he is after all Mr Big from Sex in a Cargo Plane) and then cheers up the hopelessly depressed Hanks by telling him she hung on to his car after he died and, look , here it is. At this Hanks forgets about falling forty thousand feet into the ocean and spending the best years of his life communing with stones and becomes as happy as any Walmart shopper stumbling across a bargain. I have to admit that was the moment when I expected the oxygen masks to fall from the ceiling and save us & when they didn't I had to make a break for the air outside.
I don't know what happened at the very end. But there could be no miracle great enough to redeem this cynical movie. Hanks had better be careful what kind of project he attaches himself to next: brand names degrade with misuse, faster than Fedex.",977875200,16,2876,4.193140794223827
1288024,4,B00003CXRO,"In a year of very weak movies, ""Cast Away"" proves to be the best. The direction was excellent. Tom Hanks' acting was truly convincing, and at the same time amazing, not to mention how he spent years changing his physical appearance to best fit the different parts of his role. He is sure to get an Oscar nomination for this one.
While the best part of the movie is his experience being marooned on a tropical island, the film also shows how much he and his life changed after being rescued years later. It examines the mind and behavior of Hanks' character, Chuck, while isolated from society and (for the most part) living creatures, and exhibits the natural necessity of every human to have some sort of companion. In Chuck's case this happened to be an inanimate object, namely, a volleyball. The film also points out how many unnecessary things we have in our society or possibly how much we indulge in these things without truly appreciating them.
Surprisingly, the movie was not too overdone. String instruments aren't heard in every other scene to try and impact on us a false sense of emotion. One might argue that some parts of the movie are unrealistic or a bit of a stretch, but maybe we shouldn't always try to be so logical in our thinking. There isn't too much dialogue. If Chuck is talking, it's either to himself or the volleyball. However, through several of his words and actions, Hanks manages to incorporate a nice level of humor in with all the drama. The one thing that can be quite annoying as you watch the movie is all the advertisements (I'm already paying at least $8.50 to get in, aren't I?), especially FedEx, but I've taught myself to just ignore them and enjoy the movie.  The ending has its predictable hint of Hollywood and could have been better if it went a bit differently, but this doesn't take much, if anything, away from the rest of the movie.

As soon as the movie was over I sat there stunned, asking my sister who was with me, ""What did I miss""  I kept thinking there must be a hidden meaning in there somewhere, what did I miss?

1288026,5,B00003CXRO,"It was pretty obvious that Cast Away was going to be a sucess when it hit the big screen. With director Robert Zemeckis teaming up with actor Tom Hanks for the first time since Forrest Gump, movie fans had high expectations for this movie, and were not dissapointed.
The movie opens by intorducing us to our main character, Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks), a FedEx manager who lives his life according to time. We are also introduced to Kelly (Helen Hunt), Chuck's girlfriend. It is when Noland must take an unexpected delivery overseas that the action starts. Due to mechanical error, Noland's plane goes down, leaving him stranded on an island somewhere in the pacific. He must now find a way to survive alone, with no hope of being rescued.
Noland must use what he has to survive, including the packages that were on the plane. A pair of ice skates suffice as knives,  video tapes are used as rope, and a Vollyball, who Noland compassionately names Wilson, becomes his sole companion. Noland survives well, but after four years of solitude, Noland concludes that he would rather die trying to escape the island, than die alone.
The basic plot was given to us in the previews; plane crashes, man survives, man finds tropical island, man tries to escape island. But until you see it, you never really know the whole story. You never see Chuck Noland's struggle to obtain water. You don't see his efforts to create fire or find food. And most importantly, you don't see the underlying moral; that sometimes being alone is worse than being dead.
