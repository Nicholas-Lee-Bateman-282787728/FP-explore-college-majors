719083,5,6303864740,"VCI Entertainment and Supreme Pictures present ""Between Men"" (1935) (digitally remastered), long running Johnny Mack Brown series turned out in the early '40s...the story line is excellent with outstanding productions as William Farnum shoots the men responsible for wounding his young son and rides away thinking his son is dead...enters Johnny Mack Brown who is now a grown man and is raised by Lloyd Ingraham...Johnny Mack leaves to find Ingraham's missing granddaughter Beth Marion...in his quest to find Beth, he meets Farnum as neither know that they are father and son...now enters Earl Dwire and his gang of cutthroats as they are out for blood against Johnny Mack, Farnum and Beth Marion who are now in realizing that they are connected from the past...big gun battle at the end and Farnum takes Johnny Macks place only to be killed before he can tell Johnny he's really his father...well it's not over yet until Johnny Mack Brown gives the heavy Earl Dwire his walking papers or worse a showdown gunfight.

Under director Robert N. Bradbury, producer A.W. Hackel, screenplay by Charles Francis Royal...the cast include a very young Johnny Mack Brown (Johnny Wellington Jr), Beth Marion (Gail Winters), William Farnum (John Wellington/Rand), Earl Dwire (Trent), Lloyd Ingraham (Sir George), Frank Ball (Gentry, aka Winters), Forrest Taylor (Lawyer Wyndham), Bud Osborne (bartender), Wally Wales (Blacksmith Luke), Artie Ortego (henchman), Jack Kirk (Ranch hand Joe)........special footnote, veteran character actor William Farnum started out in silent films with ""The Crisis"" (1912), ""Riders of the Purple Sage"" (1918), ""Fighting with Kit Carson"" (1933), ""Cleopatra"" (1934), ""Brand of Hate"" (1934/VCI), ""Cowboy and the Bandit"" (1935/VCI), ""Frontier Justice"" (1935/VCI), ""Custer's Last Stand"" (1936-Serial/VCI), ""The Amazing Adventures of the Clutching Hand"" (1936-Serial), ""Kid Ranger"" (1936/VCI), ""Undersea Kingdom"" (1936-Serial/VCI), ""Public Cowboy #1 (1937/VCI),""Git Along Little Doggie"" (1937/VCI), ""The Lone Ranger"" (1938), ""Shine On Harvest Moon"" (1938/VCI), ""South of the Border"" (1939), ""American Empire"" (1942/VCI), ""Silver Bullet"" (1942/VCI),""Groom Wore Spurs"" (1951/VCI)...my favorite film is ""Painted Desert"" (1931), featuring Farnum, J. Farrell MacDonald, William Boyd and Clark Gable, all give an outstanding performance, but it's Farnum and MacDonald who steal the scenes with their much expected best during both their careers........meanwhile back to another great Johnny Mack B-Western provided by Supreme Pictures during their heyday of the early '30s.

They are viewable and some are worn to the point of being blurry and hard to make out any details.  Have always enjoyed JMB as his scripts have usually been top notch.  Story lines are good but not great and some are very predictable. If you are a fan of old time Westerns then this might be a welcome addition to your collection but don't expect pristine picture quality...these are old movies that have been transferred to DVD and the picture quality overall is poor.  Too bad someone doesn't take the time to remaster these old classics. These prints are from Alpha Video.  Am going to order some JMB from VCI as they claim to have remastered theirs.  Will keep you informed as soon as I have had the chance to view them.

The story starts at John Wellington's blacksmith shop. A doctor treats a young boy for a burn; it will leave a distinct scar. People talk about the young girl who married a stranger against the wishes of her father. Gossip causes conflicts. A gun shot hits the young boy! The father shoots and chases the men who fought him. He is now wanted for murder. Years later his son runs the blacksmith shop. Sir George makes a will that ignores his granddaughter. [Does this ignore the Law of Division?] Johnny promises to find the granddaughter in New Mexico. We see a father and daughter living on a lone ranch. There is drama when Trent visits. Is he in the cattle business? Other people's stock? Trent is warned about Rand's visit. Will he bushwhack Winters? There is a chase for action. Gail falls off her horse.

Johnny and the old prospector arrive to help Gail. Rand says he will take care of Trent and his pal Trampus. The conflict is ironed out in the tavern. Johnny rescues Rand, who hires him. Gail lives there now. Rand explains his plans for Gail. Trent has plans for Rand and his cattle. Johnny sees a picture of Gail's mother! Two cowboys load hay bales onto a wagon. Will they attack Gail? There is a stunt where Johnny gets on the wagon. There is a running battle between Rand's men and Trent's gang. Rand finds Johnny and Gail, then fights Johnny until he sees the scar! There is an explanation. Rand steps outside wearing Johnny's hat. Trent gets his last chance. Rand explains his actions, but keeps something back. Johnny and Gail have a clear trail ahead.

Back in the 1950s TV recycled a lot of western movies to fill their programming schedules. This movie should be typical. It is another low-budget morality play where evildoers are punished and the good survive to live happily ever after. [Except we know that is rare in real life.] This low-budget film is similar to the mostly forgotten TV dramas of the 1950s.",1273881600,,1957,4.6017191977077365
