This is full of crusty interviewees that American viewers may have problems understanding due to their thick accents and age.  This work has cheesy reenactments.  Like Cameron's work, thankfully, this looked at both the poor and the rich on board, not just the rich.  Still, this may be a yawner to many.  However, I'm a Chicagoan and I like hearing about the Chicago World's Fair or the famous and tragic fire.  If I lived in San Francisco, I'd want to know what happened in the great earthquake of that city.  Because Titanic is so famous, I'm sure Belfasters may feel connected to it since it was built there.  They weren't there for the sinking, but it makes sense that they would ask, ""Why did you pet project get destroyed on its first mission?""  This is like a prequel and may be boring to some.  Still, the doc has value.  There's worse Titanic stuff out there, so this isn't the pits or anything.",1313539200,,999,4.556179775280899
