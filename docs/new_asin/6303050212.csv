7837315,5,6303050212,"This is a family drama of a Russian Baron Nikita Krasnoff and his household servant Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll). The movie illustrates the plight of wealthy Russians during the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917. Survival and slipping out of the country to Turkey with whatever wealth they can carry was the biggest challenge in their lives.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and household servant Nancy Carroll who later becomes his wife trek on foot to Turkey. They go through a difficult married life with some domestic violence and initial sexual harassment. Krasnoff works as a dishwasher and Tanyusha scrubs floors at a hospital for living. When restaurant patron Vera Zimina (Lilyan Tashman) finds her ex-lover Krasnoff working as a busboy, she seduces him and steals from his wife and then set him up a dirty moneymaking scheme. When Krasnoff realizes that his true love is for Tanyusha, he will go looking for her. Finally the Turkish police catch up with both of them and deport back to Russia where they have to face a grim future.

This movie makes me remember Clark Gable's ""Gone with the Wind,"" that deals with domestic issues during the American Civil War.  Fairbanks does his best as a man in control of things but it is Nancy Carroll who offers an excellent performance as an abused woman. Lilyan Tashman was a confirmed lesbian in early Hollywood and she made no secret of her sexuality, yet her role as a sexy man-snatching woman is somewhat hard to swallow. The music by Harry Warren is rich especially the one played during the wedding ceremony. This movie was great when it was released in 1932 but the domestic issues dealt in this movie could bother some viewers. This movie is highly recommended to all the fans of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Nancy Carroll and Lilyan Tashman.",1401926400,,1777,4.858085808580858
7837316,4,6303050212,"Dialog is very fine:  ""I never cared much about morals, but good taste is so important.""  That's the hero early on.  I won't give away the plot.  The whole thing is only an hour.",1399420800,,178,4.147058823529412
7837317,5,6303050212,"This rare and very excellent movie has to be discovered. Real jewel of the beginner talking cinema, with a not-very-well-known subject and the young but already excellent actor Douglas Fairbanks jr. Was the outcome, the official idea of the USA at the beginning of the 30s,  namely a certain accommodation with regard to the Soviet regime, a criticism of the renunciation of the Western countries, an idyllic romantic happy end imposed by producers, an ideological blindness, quite at once. I hope that a day ""Scarlet dawn"" will be a  DVD with subtitled multi-languages and notices about the director and the subject.",1295568000,,617,5.099009900990099
7837318,4,6303050212,"I must admit that I didn't expect much from this film, mostly because I thought it was an hour long ""B"" picture.  But I was pleasantly surprised at the performances of both Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Nancy Carroll.  This is the first film in which I have seen Ms. Carroll, and based on this performance, I will be looking for more of her films in the near fuure.",1268784000,,362,4.3088235294117645
7837319,2,6303050212,"This movie has lots of action and little heart. Let's forget for a minute that it gets just about every aspect of the Russian Revolution wrong - after all we only have only under an hour here to tell our story. In fact, the czar abdicated after World War I proved a disaster for the country, and a provisional government tried to rule as a pseudo-democracy until the Leninists took power nine months later, mainly because they promised to immediately withdraw Russia from the war. Now, back to our story.

Here we have the revolution being ""rumored"" in Russian newspapers in what appears to still be a functioning country until violence erupts suddenly and upends the life of nobleman Baron Nikita 'Nikki' Krasnoff (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). He flees his home with his former servant girl Tanyusha (Nancy Carroll) in tow, and they start to make a new life in Constantinople. Before the revolution the Baron made a regular habit out of making a play for the girl, not out of any real passion, but out of boredom as a diversion of sorts. The revolution doesn't change this, and he continues to try to take advantage of what is obviously a very simple girl. It certainly doesn't make the audience like this guy to see him toying with her so. Tanyusha follows the Baron because she literally has no place to go after the revolutionaries take over the Baron's home, and she has known no other life other than waiting on Nikki hand and foot. Once in Constantinople, Nikki quickly wearies of life as a penniless laborer, and that is when he meets up with his former lover, Russian aristocrat Vera Zimina, who has a plan for getting them to Paris where the Tsarists have congregated after the revolution. Unfortunately for Tanyusha, Vera's plan does not include her.

This film manages to completely waste the considerable acting talents of early talkie actress Nancy Carroll. She does a good job with what little she is given to do, but that is not much. Lilyan Tashman is the standout here, even though she has only a small role as Russian vamp Vera. Lilyan was so often given supporting roles just as she is here, but her earthy voice and glamorous looks make her the center of attention in every scene in which she appears. Guy Kibbee even shows up in a humorous bit as an American tourist who is curious about the Russian royalty that has been forcefully ejected from their homeland.

I recommend passing on this one.",1264723200,,2412,4.670588235294118
7837320,3,6303050212,"This almost-forgotten flick from 1932 is a lavishly adorned costume epic which is set during the Russian Revolution.  Aristocratic Fairbanks plays Nikiti who flees his Russian home with his maid Tanyusha (the elusive-on-video Nancy Carroll).  The lovers end up in Constantinople where they marry and settle into a life of common labour.  Eventually, Fairbank's cultured personality makes him discontented with his new life & he succumbs to having an affair with a vampy woman named Vera (Lilyan Tashman)...The plot drags in bits, and the movie is somewhat uneven, however the magnificent sets are impressive: from the great aristocratic homes to the lowly Turkish dives.  Notable mostly for a rare glimpse of the once-popular and talented Nancy Carroll, an actress of Irish descent who was in many fine films during the early talkies. More of her finer films hopefully will find their way to video in the near future!",1033430400,2,917,5.175675675675675
