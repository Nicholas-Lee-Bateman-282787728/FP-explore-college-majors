3791464,5,B001TK80DO,"These DVDs are fun and informative. The narrator is really engaging and you can't help but be swept along with his enthusiasm and good humor. And along the way, you learn a lot about each of the projects he tackles. Great for entertaining while simultaneously educating your kids.",1272067200,3,280,4.854166666666667
3791465,5,B001TK80DO,"This is a fascinating series!  Every episode is different, and Sean Riley (the host) is fun to watch... really knowledgeable, too. You don't have to be an engineer to love watching these fixes. You get to see enormous and amazing repairs that get done every day just to keep things running for us all.  Handling 500 volts of electricity while hanging off the side of a helicopter?  Dang!  I also liked the show about fixing the giant telescope in Chile.  Riley is just as comfortable and engaging working side by side with scientists or daredevil tower climbers.  Riley is adept at moving into some seriously tough situations and then making us feel like we are right there in the fix, too.  He works 2,000 feet up on radio towers, or under water in a roiling sea doing ship repairs... and everywhere else you can imagine.  And in spite of the tension, Riley always finds a way to make us laugh a little, too. I recommend it for your whole family.  This show is great.",1265328000,4,968,4.517241379310345

3791473,5,B001TK80DO,"Wana watch some very good action being presented in HD!? Rent it for 1.99 and well worth it. I have rented most if not all of the shows presented here. If you have a Roku box or the Boxe Box or a Blu-Ray enabled player you can use and download the app call Amazon Prime. For 79.95 for the whole year you get commercial free movies and programs!

3791474,5,B001TK80DO,I like the series for teaching kids how to do the seemingly impossible. The host is a rigger used to heights and they have him in precarious positions to help solve the biggest problems.,1364428800,,186,4.5
