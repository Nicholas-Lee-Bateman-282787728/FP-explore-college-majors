Currently at the time of this being typed the current price of this box set is 90 dollars.

This includes what you see on amazon as collection one, two, three, and four.

However, if you look at those prices , you will find out this isn't as good of a steal as it may seem

Collection one amazon price : 19.92
Collection two amazon price : 20:47
Collection three amazon price : 20.47
Collection four amazon price : 19.71

total price for all four collections separate : 80.57
So for ten dollars less on the same exact website, you can get the same exact episodes for 10 dollars cheaper. Same is the case with collection box 2 , so you'll be saving yourself 20 bucks by not getting these and instead buying each set separate
Heck with that extra 20 bucks you could go out and buy another collection of one piece and get another 25 episodes.",1410566400,35,854,4.31875
6599386,5,B00MQ2X7UU,I would love to see a Bleach release like this as well and a Naruto.,1408924800,9,68,3.6
6599387,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Can you please release Bleach like this? I would highly appreciate it.,1408752000,8,70,4.916666666666667
6599388,5,B00MQ2X7UU,I enjoyed this item very much,1452643200,,29,4.0
6599389,1,B00MQ2X7UU,Once we got to the second volume we started experiencing issues with playback almost every episode. Now on the third volume we can barely make any progress without the DVD freezing and saying disk read error. Very disappointed as this was a Christmas gift for my girlfriend and she can barely watch it.,1452297600,,302,4.716981132075472
6599390,5,B00MQ2X7UU,This box set is extremely good. The box came without scratches or something. Totally perfect. Just as described. And the price was just right.,1451347200,,142,4.958333333333333
6599391,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"I love this product! Once I saw it, I couldn't believe it and didn't hesitate to buy it. I got it half off on a lightning deal and I am so glad I did. It is a nice collection and has more things than I thought it would. It is definitely worth a lot more than what I paid for.",1450483200,,275,3.6
6599392,5,B00MQ2X7UU,I had ordered one before that was pretty messed up the side was tron almost off and some dvds were loose. The replacement that the sent is in great shape and all is good. Make sure to check yours when you get it. Other than that its just perfect.,1450224000,,246,4.040816326530612
6599393,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"Haven't been able to open the content yet as it is for a gift, but the outside box is just as described and looks superb. Can't wait to give my friend the rest of the OP collection!",1450224000,,181,3.918918918918919
6599394,4,B00MQ2X7UU,"This is a fantastic set! I had wanted to get into this series for a while and upon seeing a collection decided to start the voyage. You get the first four collections in this set, which is a total of 103 episodes! If you love One Piece or want to get into it, I would strongly suggest buying this box set. I had hesitated purchasing it, because it was relatively expensive (99.99) but was on sale through Amazon. After purchasing and experiencing this set up would say that even at MSRP this set it completely worth it. Just as a point of reference there is just shy of 43 hours worth on content included in this set! The only reason I gave this set was that the packaging on one collection was slightly damaged, all the discs are fine though. It is really more of an aesthetic reason why I gave it 4 stars, I had read other people had this problem as well so I assume it is a relatively common issue. If I was just rating the content alone I would give it 5 stars. Overall if there is an anime fan looking for a new series to start or if you already are a One Piece fan and looking to get the series on DVD this set is for you!",1449792000,4,1128,4.062780269058296

6599398,1,B00MQ2X7UU,"The Video quality is nice and the marathon feature is really good (One scene after the other without the in- and outro)

Why 1 Starrating then?
The box was damaged on serveral corners and the CD covers were crashed inside as well.
I want to collect all the boxes and put them on a self, but with all the damage it isn't that nice now :(",1444953600,2,336,4.090909090909091
6599399,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Very good price for a 103 episodes a good deal for collectors.,1442707200,,62,4.25
6599400,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"I love this anime series , and being able to just snag a collection box for my own personal collection, I cannot complain.  I bought these so that i could still enjoy one of my favorite series in the event I ever have to go someplace where I cannot access the streaming services of the internet.  The set is beautiful and the contents are well put including a surprise or two that I had not expected.",1441152000,,400,4.25
6599401,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Loved it!,1439078400,,9,4.0
6599402,5,B00MQ2X7UU,What a great collection of One Piece! I absolutely love it! extremely happy with my purchase!,1438473600,,93,4.875
6599403,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"Just received the box today!

I am SO happy with it, exactly what I was looking for. The box looks great and is extremely sturdy! No scratches or dents. The poster looks great!! Very colorful and a good size, plus the art slips and stickers are cool. Overall, a box-set worthy of the King of the Pirates himself! :D",1431475200,,315,4.338983050847458
6599404,5,B00MQ2X7UU,s*** is gangsta . everyone needs this in their anime collection,1430697600,2,63,4.818181818181818
6599405,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Awesome.... like it. bonus items focus on Luffy. Cant wait to see more collections. Hopefully to see if they will do same thing with BLEACH and other longevity anime.,1427760000,,166,4.758620689655173
6599406,3,B00MQ2X7UU,"Okay let me say this first, I have no regrets buying this box set. Being someone new to the series, it was nice to score the first 103 episodes in one fell swoop. And I must add that One Piece is easily my new all time favorite anime series. HOWEVER this box set is plagued with quality control issues. Upon receiving my first order, one of the dvd cases inside the box was ruined. Thankfully Amazon makes replacing items a breeze so I was able to get another box set with no issues. My replacement was much better though the dvd sleeve in each of the four collections (the little plastic holder that holds dvds 2 and 3) was unhinged and had to be snapped down. On top of that the box is very poorly designed making getting the dvds out an absolute pain in the rear. That said I love my Box One set though from here on out I may just opt to get the collections separately.",1427068800,4,872,4.165680473372781

6599408,1,B00MQ2X7UU,good collection overall however....Collection 4 case is severely damaged... It's hard to call something a collectible when one of the cases arrived damaged...just opened it today... Can't claim exchange/return on it now :( :( unreal,1426377600,4,232,5.6571428571428575
6599409,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Absolutely the best so happy I got it fast and with no problems,1425427200,,63,3.923076923076923
6599410,4,B00MQ2X7UU,"Love it. Saw 3 episodes and was hooked, I knew I had to buy every season. This show just gives you the good feels. The art style I wasn't too crazy about at first but the story really pulls you in and matches the art style. The stickers that came with it are really cute, the poster is awesome, and the case it comes in is sturdy.",1425340800,2,330,3.9402985074626864
6599411,5,B00MQ2X7UU,My children and I love this show and we were happy with the fast delivery time.,1425340800,,79,4.0
6599412,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Love the one piece box set,1425168000,,26,3.5
6599413,2,B00MQ2X7UU,I was so excited to receive this box set. One Piece is my favorite anime. I am upset though that the box the dvds come in was torn have way down and smashed in abit. I would have loved it if the box wasn't damaged at all.,1424822400,,221,3.723404255319149
6599414,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Love the marathom feature,1424736000,,25,5.5
6599415,5,B00MQ2X7UU,Perfect collection. This is a must If you love the show and haven't started buying the dvd's yet. The collection box set is 20.00 cheaper then buying the individual dvd's.,1424736000,,171,4.733333333333333
6599416,5,B00MQ2X7UU,It was what I was looking for I hope they do the entire series I will buy every one,1424649600,,83,3.4210526315789473
6599417,3,B00MQ2X7UU,"Nice to have it in a decent box, however some of the seasons that I got had broken plastic bits in the cases including my hinges.",1423180800,2,129,4.0
6599418,1,B00MQ2X7UU,Not the same One Piece Collection No 1-4 dvd individual. Inside the One Piece Collection: Box One Each dvd doesn't have the contents list of each Disc 1 ep name. You just buy a dvd with no contents.,1423180800,8,198,4.2368421052631575
6599419,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"OMG! Crap! I bought them one after the other individually! Man, if I had known something this sweet was coming out, I would have waited! ARGH!
Right now I bought all seasons up to no. 9. I might wait for the third box, which will obviously contain collections 9-12. I was about to order 10 & 11, but now I'll just have to wait... Boy that ticks me off!!!",1421798400,3,354,4.144927536231884
6599420,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"I can't believe this did not release sooner! Great buy! Might be a little more costly than buying each collection separately but it is well worth it because as a major collector I love the case it comes in and the picture cards and stickers. I really hope they continue making these in the future. I am definitely getting box 2 but hopefully they make box 3, 4, 5, and so on and each box should be 100+ episodes.",1421712000,,412,4.227848101265823
6599421,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"It's an instant buy for me. Being a fan of One Piece, Funimation did a great job with this. Thanks to them for not editing out the blood or anything like that, just the way it was meant to be. I love it!!! ^_^",1421625600,7,209,3.772727272727273
6599422,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"Despite being $10 more than buying the sets individually, it is a collectors set that includes 4 stickers that match the individual cases (I.e. Luffy' hand drawn flag), and Luffy's first wanted poster prior to the events of Alabasta. For anyone just starting out, or a die hard fan, it's a great set to have in your anime collection.",1420848000,4,333,4.661016949152542
6599423,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"This box set comes with 3 stickers, 4 art cards which are basically the pictures of the DVD covers, a Luffy wanted poster, a little holder that would hold all 4 cases together, and the nice sturdy box. I've never actually seen the show from the beginning or have really watched it but always wanted to and now I'm able to finally start it! This is a great deal if you don't already own the individual DVD collections and if you want to have 4 in 1 box set! Definitely recommend it!!",1420502400,76,482,4.25
6599424,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"Just got mine in today and it's nice. There's not much to it other than it's basically the first four collections housed in a nice rigid box, which I like. You also get a poster, 3 stickers and 4 postcards. If you like your anime series in boxes, then get it as the box is very nice but it's also a lot bigger than the 4 individual dvd collections. If you don't have room or just don't want the spend the extra money, then get the regular edition as the box is about the only thing you're getting that's going to make it worth it or not. Can't wait for the second collection to come out.",1420502400,14,587,4.068965517241379
6599425,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"Though it's not mentioned anywhere here, it comes with 3 stickers (Luffy, Strawhat Jolly Roger, Luffy's crappy version of the strawhat jolly roger), 4 art cards (same images as on the dvd cases), and my favorite, Luffy's 30,000 beri wanted poster.

The box itself looks amazing, and feels sturdy.

The dvds are the collection releases, complete with cases and slipcovers.

Great set! -- Can't wait for Box 2 next month!",1420502400,10,419,4.957142857142857
6599426,5,B00MQ2X7UU,"For such a long running series it's hard not to have a collection like this. Most collections give you about 24 episodes while this one is giving you 103. That's staggering. I like this move. As an avid fan of anime, when shows like One Piece and Naruto get into over a hundred episodes, wanting to collecting them on DVD or Blu Ray can seem daunting to say the least, so seeing them putting forth a new Collection such as this gives me hope for Bleach and Naruto to get one too. I can honestly say that if you are a fan of One Piece and don't have it on DVD then you should strongly consider picking this up. The Price is a bargin for 103 episodes!

As for One Piece itself, you follow the Adventure of Monkey D. Luffy. He's a pirate. He also has crazy stretching powers thanks to the Gum Gum Fruit. A vast majority of this first collection will be him getting his crew together and it's honestly good times all around. One Piece has always been a ""love it or hate it"" anime, but honestly it's pretty good all around and if you are new to the series then this is a great start off point. Buckle in though. This series is STILL going on to this very day.",1415318400,10,1154,4.151785714285714

8673871,3,B00MQ2X7UU,"Each of the DVD cases were broken along with the edges of the box being torn. The actual DVDs are okay but it would have been nice to have a box set that was actually intact, especially considering the price and long wait and delays..",1476748800,,234,4.222222222222222
