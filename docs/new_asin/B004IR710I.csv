8431098,5,B004IR710I,"Schwerelos is an outstanding example of Schlager music.  Andrea Berg is a tall and very attractive woman, and she delivers a lively and excellent performance.  Andrea Berg's voice has a unique and pleasant timbre.  The combination of her vocal qualities and delivery are very well suited for Schlager music.  The instrumental accompaniment is also excellent and has that somewhat hypnotic Schlager beat.  The occasional pyrotechnic displays and lighting effects serve to enhance the performance.  Andrea receives numerous gifts of flowers during the concert.  Schlager music appears to be very popular in Germany.  It is interesting to observe the audience.  Many in the audience appear to be caught up in the occasion and join in.  Andrea Berg's talents extend beyond Schlager music. She can sing very well in English.  Although she did not include any English songs in Schwerelos, she occasionally  sings a song in English in some of her concerts.  Her renditions of ""My Heart Will go On"" and ""Give Me Your Heart"" are particularly outstanding and can be found on YouTube.  The DVD that I received was formatted for PAL and region 2 and is best played in an all region player, or on a computer which can accommodate PAL region 2.",1432771200,,1230,4.995073891625616
