8382655,5,B002VZHPYG,"This is by far my family's favorite DVD. The kids want to watch it in the car, in the house, on vacation. It never fails to get us all up and dancing. My favorite video is Taddy, my youngest loves Bedhead and my oldest could watch the concert and the behind the scenes stuff all day. Even my music-snob husband gives it his stamp of approval. And that's saying A LOT.",1269475200,,367,4.183098591549296
