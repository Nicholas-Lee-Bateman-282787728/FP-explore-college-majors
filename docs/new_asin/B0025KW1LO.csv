8351129,4,B0025KW1LO,Basically I got this movie as an old schoolmate of mine has a son who produced the movie. So I got it just to see how it went. Actually it is a pretty good little flick. The production values are high for a film not produced by a major company. If you like 'off the wall' films that do not get a lot of press I would recommend you see this one.,1314057600,,344,3.7916666666666665
