8304033,5,B001G5ZO7M,This Dvd is an excellent musical treat.  The young artist is very talented and the story of her life and interest in wild life is very inspiring.,1335139200,4,145,4.37037037037037
8304034,5,B001G5ZO7M,"While I'm sorry the one star folks felt misled, those classical music lovers who want to know about the life of an extraordinary artist and human being won't be disappointed.  For Helene, the wolves represent so much more than the animal itself, though that is extremely important in her life. In a very real sense they sympbolize the pursuit of quality and ecological balance that this pianist brings to her artistry, but more, that this beautiful woman brings to her life.  Mesmerizing.",1331769600,12,488,4.939024390243903
8304035,1,B001G5ZO7M,"I bought this DVD for my grandaughter who loves wolves, it was so dissapointing to her, it has really nothing to do with wolves, its all about the woman. It was a rip off,a scam, whatever you want to call, I will NEVER buy anything with this woman's name on it. The wolf part was about 2min. and she feed them like dogs, poor wolves.",1308182400,6,333,4.138461538461539
8304036,1,B001G5ZO7M,"I am so disappointed to buy this DVD with a false title and false description. I really feel cheated. This DVD is titled, Living with Wolves. It's a laugh to see about 2 minutes of 4 wolves in a fenced area being feed like pets do in what is called Wolf Conservation Center.",1301616000,4,274,4.188679245283019
8304037,1,B001G5ZO7M,It is a short film about her time in America. The film is interrupted by short sequences about her concerts and the rehearsals. The wolfs are not the main aspects of the film. They play only a short part in the film. They have nearly five minutes to justify the title. It is the same problem as it is shown by the media. Helene Grimaud is the one with the wolfs. But no one really cares about the wolfs. It is an attraction to make her public. For the connoisseur it is a matter of marketing only. It is her music what makes her really attractive. You can see a few snaps of the second Rachmaninov concert and Brahms and Beethoven too. It is a good video to promote a concert tour. But for me it is a minor attraction. What I miss is a concert at the end of the film. This was a good possibility to give the viewer a chance to have a goody with the DVD. But this wasn't in the view of the production team.,1273881600,20,905,4.033333333333333
