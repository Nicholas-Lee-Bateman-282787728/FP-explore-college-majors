2605617,4,B000GEIRBO,"A great production with the use of the split screen and visual reminders.  Chapters include standing, side and lying moves. My favorite move: helicopter legs. I also love all the standing moves because they make one feel so graceful. I like the instructor, but I found her talking far more than I cared for.",1169942400,3,307,4.685185185185185
2605618,5,B000GEIRBO,"This is a good workout that will make you feel like you are shaping your body. However, I don't think that there is enough of a cardio factor to really help with weight loss. I do love being able to customize the level at which I do workouts. Every move starts with the level 1, then are modified to levels 2 and 3. Then, a full set is done at whatever level you choose. It's nice that you don't have to stick with the same level for the whole workout (which is about 35 minutes). You can work on your weakest areas at level 1, then easily switch to level 2. I really like the instructor. She's not too peppy or ridiculously ripped or skinny (you feel like you could actually look like her without starving yourself or having just good genetics). A good overall toning workout.",1167955200,12,777,4.292517006802721
2605619,5,B000GEIRBO,I have never had any success with Pilates until this video.  It features three different levels so you can pick the level that is right for you.  Ellen Barrett is very upbeat and knowledgeable without being annoying.  Excellent video!,1164326400,6,234,4.948717948717949
2605620,4,B000GEIRBO,"I have this dvd and have used it a few times. It is great in that it is only 30 mins. Also it it nice that first you do the standing pilates, then the side then the mat. I like that I don't spend half the workout changing positons. yes, there are breaks in between while she explains the next thing, but for beginers ""feeling the burn"" this is a welcome break. I like that I can advance through without having to buy more vidoes. I would love to be able to do all the level 3 workouts and say they are not advanced enough! Hopefully when that time comes finding a new pilates video will be the last of my concerns. I do agree though that there isn't as much work on the abs. I reccomend the Crunch pick your spot pilates if you want great abs.",1163635200,5,743,4.027027027027027
2605621,5,B000GEIRBO,"I own many Pilates DVDs due to the fact that once I have peaked at a certain level, in order to progress, I need to purchase a new DVD. Not the case with Pick Your Level Weight Loss Pilates!  This is the best Pilates video by far that has been developed!  What a creative approach to fitness, offering the purchaser three levels of Pilates in one single DVD.  I love the idea of having each level color coded which makes it easy to follow, and the fact that you can interchange the levels with each routine you do.  It's like going to a new class each time you turn it on!!  And as usual, each step is explained completely by Ellen, with smooth transitions and no confusion as to what's coming next.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone looking for something new and challenging, and of course fun!",1162425600,31,806,4.34
2605622,5,B000GEIRBO,"Being new to pilates, I found the workout quite accommodating.  I was able to choose the level that best matched my ability, workout every area of my body and be finished in just 30 minutes.  Plus, this workout will allow me to advance without having to buy other workout DVDs.",1158796800,3,277,4.52
2605623,3,B000GEIRBO,"The concept behind ""Pick Your Level: Weight Loss Pilates"" is that you can customize your workout by choosing the level which best suits your needs for each and every exercise.  This is done through the use of three different exercisers displaying three different levels of difficulty.  Instructor Ellen Barrett always does Level 2, the intermediate version, while her two background exercisers show the beginning (Level 1) and more advanced (Level 3) versions.

The workout itself is broken down into three 10-minute segments:  Standing Pilates, Side-Lying Pilates, and Pilates Matwork.  The standing work is similar to several of Ellen's previous videos (eg, Crunch Burn & Firm Pilates) in that you are doing moves such as plies, leg lifts, standing leg circles, etc.  This segment focused mainly on legwork, although the Level 3 modifier added arms movements to increase the intensity.  Still, this section felt like light toning at best, and it certain lacked the cardio benefit to produce the ""weight loss"" promised in the title.  The side lying moves are a bit more intense, beginning with a side plank.  Some of the exercises here were similar to the Winsor Buns and Thighs video, and I could feel them in my glutes/outer hip.  Again, Ellen does the middle level while the two background exercisers show modifications.  Unlike in the standing section, however, each new move does not begin until Ellen explains all three levels, which makes for a lot of unnecessary downtime.  In the final segment, Pilates matwork, Ellen has her Level 3 modifier add a few twists to traditional Pilates moves, making them more challenging.  However, I found this to be a fairly easy matwork sequence which failed to incorporate any of the classic Pilates intermediate and advanced moves.  Also, Ellen continued to focus on the lower body here; the abs work was not very intense, and no back work was included.

Overall, I did not enjoy this video.  Even following the Level 3 modifier, I found the intensity to be a low intermediate level at best, and so I did not feel like I got much of a workout.  Also, as mentioned above, there seemed to be too much down-time while Ellen set up the levels, particularly in the second and third segments; she also spends too much time at the end of each segment just breathing.  Similarly, the workout seemed to move at a very slow pace throughout, leaving me bored and eager to finish it.  A final issue was that I just did not click with Ellen's perky personality.  I do think that this DVD is nicely produced and likely to appeal to some, mainly those who have enjoyed Ellen's prior Pilates videos and who are at a more beginning/low intermediate level in their Pilates work.",1156550400,56,2706,4.866812227074236
2605624,5,B000GEIRBO,"Ellen Barrett is one of my favorite instructors.  Sticking to a workout for me depends a lot upon the instructor.  Doing Ellen's other workouts have really changed my body; not just the building up and toning that you get with strength workouts but a feeling of a strong, lean body and good posture.  What I do not like, or generally have time for, is a 45 to 60 minute workout.  This workout - at about 30 minutes - is perfect for me.  The first day I went through the dvd, I was not sure I felt challenged.  Yet, the next day, I really felt it in my legs and I have been working out for some time.  This is a good workout for me that I can fit into my day easily.",1155945600,10,665,3.992424242424242
2605625,4,B000GEIRBO,"While very short, these routines can be done for any level, whether you are only a beginner or advanced.  Each routine is shown at three different levels so everyone can benefit from it.  Ellen is a good instructor and she's down to earth and it makes it easy to follow.  The other exercisers in the routines are visible for most of the time so it makes it easy to choose your positions.  All up, it's about 35-40 minutes and it's short, but effective.  You will feel like you've done yourself some good which is the whole point, and if done enough, you'll see results soon.  I just got this the other day, so I've done it only once, but I can tell that if I keep it up, I'm going to be very happy I bought this.",1154131200,17,712,4.160583941605839

2605628,5,B000GEIRBO,"This is my go-to exercise video!  I love Pilates in general, but this video gives you three levels to work out to so that you can choose to do simple, intermediate, or expert moves.  Having the choice to do any of the three levels with every single exercise gives you the flexibility to change up your workout each and time you do it. I have experienced amazing results after a short time. It is definitely toning my abs and core.  Several friends purchased this video upon my recommendation and they have all loved it like I do!",1457827200,3,529,4.43298969072165
2605629,5,B000GEIRBO,Love the 3 levels it has. Definitely a nice workout and doesn't make you feel like you can't do it on a daily basis. Really helps relieve the stress in my back and makes my body feel strong and not over worked.,1457568000,,210,4.023809523809524

2605639,5,B000GEIRBO,"This is THE PERFECT STORM of Pilates work out DVDs!  Unlike others, where it feels like the instructor is smirking at your pathetic mortal weakness from beyond the screen, Ellen Barrett truly delivers a work out that is both intense, varietal and relaxing.  Strange I know, but this has been the only Pilates workout that has caused me to pour sweat while feeling like I'm relaxed yet focused.  Other Pilates DVDs make me feel like I'm going to burst a blood vessel in my forehead and don't put enough emphasis on the breath which is sooo key to a great Pilates work-out.  You can mix and match and change the focus of your work out and tune it to whatever energy level you may be feeling that day.  Finally, her voice is soothing and motivating, not pushy, snarky or arrogant.  She also doesn't talk too much or too little but just right... not to be the Goldilocks of Work-out Instructors, but it does get difficult to concentrate on stabilizing the core and keeping the breath up if the instructor doesn't take time to breathe herself.  If you're going to buy 1 Pilates DVD this one should rank at least top 3 if not numero uno.",1444953600,5,1131,4.487804878048781

2605642,3,B000GEIRBO,"Not my favorite of Ellen Barrett's DVDs (and I am a huge fan).  The ""pick your level"" is a great feature; in addition, there are three segments that have you work out in different ways (e.g., standing, floor work, etc.).  But, the workout is not terribly difficult  - and this is coming from someone who exercises only a few times per week.  The most challenging level seems to be due to the coordination required for the moves (e.g., quickly moving feet), not necessarily the strength required.  But, the DVD was inexpensive, and this is a good option when you don't have a lot of time.",1441584000,,587,4.552380952380952
2605643,5,B000GEIRBO,"Great workout, and the different levels are great.  Sometimes you need an easy workout, and sometimes you want to be challenged, and this DVD has it all. They have 3 people doing different levels of workout at the same time - Love it!",1437955200,,234,4.441860465116279
2605644,3,B000GEIRBO,I've worked out to a few of Ellen's dvds and J wasn't very impressed by this one.,1436918400,,81,3.823529411764706
2605645,4,B000GEIRBO,"For the price, this DVD is great. I like the different levels that I can choose, depending on how I feel each day and how much of a challenge I need.  I find it easy to follow, and I like the music, which fits the motions perfectly.",1436659200,,232,3.9361702127659575

2605647,4,B000GEIRBO,"Great video. I add weights to my arms and ankles to increase muscle definition. Only downside is the girl I like to follow along with in the video has cameltoe the whole 30 minutes long. It's a little distracting.

2605650,5,B000GEIRBO,I really like that this DVD has 3 levels so I can use the level 1 version until I am able to work up to the others later down the road.  It's fun and fast past.  There's never a dull moment or time consuming switches from floor work and standing work. I'd highly recommend it.,1433289600,,276,4.0
2605651,4,B000GEIRBO,"It is difficult to decide whether I should give four stars or five. I thought there were options to choose each level of Pilates. All three levels play at the same time.
The exercises are fairly easy to follow. I say fairly because they cut out the first and second level to focus solely on the third level for several reps of each exercise.
Otherwise, awesome workout!",1433116800,,369,4.522388059701493
2605652,2,B000GEIRBO,"During the entire DVD, I stuck to the level 3 workout performed by on of the fitness instructors on here and I didn't feel challenged at all. Even though I work out regularly, I don't necessarily consider myself an advanced athlete, so the fact that this DVD was too easy for me leads me to conclude that it's only for absolute beginners to exercise. There are too few repetitions, too much time wasted on simple breathing and stretching. It's fine for, say, a relaxing stretch session in between harder workout days, but I wouldn't count on it to make you lose weight.",1432252800,,569,4.588235294117647
2605653,5,B000GEIRBO,Ilove how they have all three levels showing at once. I can pick which exercises to try and take to the next level as I'm working out. I don't get bored with this workout. Great low impact exercises.,1431475200,,199,4.2631578947368425

This DVD workout plan is wonderful. It's simple to follow along ( I have two left feet), easy to understand the movements, and I can choose which intensity to follow with each exercise as I go along. I think that's the best part of the DVD. I don't have to pick and choose from a menu. The program flows with three women doing the exercises together. Each one is doing a different level all at the same time so I can just watch whichever person I want to with each movement/position. Some of the exercises I can do level 3 but some only level 1. No matter what, I don't have to stop the dvd or switch to a different workout. I just follow along.

Although I'm overweight, I'm quite limber so, with a little practice, I'm now able to do most of the moves at level 2 or 3 which encourages me to keep pushing (even though the instructor reminds me level 1 is a great benefit!).",1413676800,,566,4.5588235294117645

I have never been small, most definitely on the curvy side, but this did not take those curves, it just tightened them up and they jiggled less. It also has flattened my baby belly some as well.

I specifically like the leg exercise bc I'm quite flexible, however I'm not as flexible as that crazy level 3 woman!

I was a new subscriber to the service and learned the hard way that they routinely change which videos they offer for their viewers. After watching the first few minutes to several fitness videos they had available at the time and being completely unimpressed, I found this one. Iwas so hooked on this video by then, I HAD to find it and purchase it.  Ellen Barrett did an excellent job with the setup of the exercises in this video. There is someone to model EACH level of intensity (Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced) for every single action. That was wonderful for me. I have some experience with Yoga and Pilates, but I have some joint problems in my upper body and her modifications helped me get through the workout without stressing my joints!

The biggest advantage was that I lost weight AND toned at the same time without feeling like I was being pushed too hard. Excellent for older beginners and people with joint problems or other general pain issues, in my opinion.",1404172800,2,1126,4.710659898477157

My rheumatologist recommended that I stretch the crap out of my body in order to feel better and I have included this DVD in my regimen.....wonderful!  There are no 'twist into a pretzel' moves like some of the yoga DVDs and you can actually work your way into the moves.  I am doing all three levels now!  I switch up and do the ones I am able to do.  I started out doing only level 1.  My Rheumatologist was correct.....stretching the crap out of my body is truly making me feel better and that is a challenge for me at this time in my life.  Highly, highly recommended for anyone suffering from joint stiffness, aches and pains.  Never give up!",1384387200,2,732,4.2846715328467155

2605723,5,B000GEIRBO,I like this exercise DVD because it flows nicely from one exercise to another and by the of the DVD you are working up a nice sweat.  It is not a hard DVD to do so it would be nice one start with for beginners that want to learn how to do  Pilates.  I enjoy Ellen very much and would like to see another DVD like this one with harder moves (there is one woman in the DVD that does harder Pilates moves for you to follow) for more advance exercisers that know how to do Pilates.,1382140800,,477,3.8969072164948453

2605725,5,B000GEIRBO,I've never done pilates.  I was recently looking for some exercise videos to add to my collection that I rotate weekly.  I love this video.  I think I'll get lots of use out of it as I get better.  I love that it gives three level options for all moves.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.,1381190400,,306,4.11864406779661

I absolutely love the instructor - Ellen Barrett - I have about 20 workout DVDs with various instructors Ellen is definitely the best by far in terms of cueing. You always know the next move before you flow into it (this is the same for all her DVDs) whereas with some instructors they tell you to change AFTER they change to the next move (i.e. Denise Austin - can't believe I got 3 of her DVDs without checking her out first!). Ellen also has a lovely positive personality without being annoying.

This isn't pure pilates but a fusion of various disciplines.

It's a fun, light workout - I often precede it with interval training on the treadmill to get my heart rate up first.",1379462400,4,945,4.268156424581005

If you're a beginner or not feeling that strong, you can follow one of the three women doing all the exercises.  If you feel stronger, you can follow the leader of the Workout.  If you're really experienced or in strong shape, you can follow the third demonstrator.  What is great about this tape is that you can switch back and forth in each exercise, so that you might follow woman #1 in a few of the exercises, and woman #2 or woman #3 in some of the other exercises.  You're continually working out all parts of your body and you're always doing it at a level which is comfortable for YOU!  The directions are clear and the workout leaves you feeling energized and strong.  I love it and do it at least 4 times a week.

I love the three different levels going all the way through, so for each step you can do the version that feels best to you, and then move up to a more advanced level once you get used to the beginners level.  I tend to have almost 50/50 experience of being beginning/advanced for various moves throughout a workout video, so its great to be able to follow whichever level feels right from one move to the next.",1375833600,,595,4.303571428571429

2605750,5,B000GEIRBO,"I took a Pilates class a while back and really fell in love with it even though I was not very fit or flexible. I began a more focused and committed journey towards health on June 2012 and I used this dvd to help get me on track. Even though this video is only 30 minutes, I was able to fill a small portion of my day with a workout that I would not have otherwise done. On the other hand, it is only 30 minutes long! So I was able to do this every single day for around 2 months, when I finally ""graduated"" onto a harder workout on youtube called POP Pilates. It's great that there are different levels because you get to feel as if there are goals for you to strive for. It is also great for days when you are sore and need to scale back a bit, so you merely focus on level 1 or 2. It's motivational to see level 3 moves, and you feel as if they are something to strive for. You'll feel so accomplished as you see yourself moving up in level and becoming stronger and healthier. Overall this exercise is very gentle on your joints and the pace gives you time to catch your breath and spread oxygen throughout your body. It's actually quite relaxing. Combined with a drastic diet change (I switched to eating whole foods only), I was able to lose 10-12 lbs a month solely utilizing this dvd. A year later, I have lost a little over 60 lbs and I look back fondly at this dvd for helping me get started.",1373068800,3,1402,4.083333333333333

2605752,5,B000GEIRBO,"Ellen Barrett is excellent. This workout is gentle and effective. It is not jittery or hyped up. I love the floor work and find this the most enjoyable of all her DVD's. The music is nice, the set is simple and modern, she is very thorough with her instructions. Her tone is upbeat and respectful. It is just perfect! I have over 10 of her dvd's and this is my all time favorite. Some of her ""at the studio"" dvd's are a bit preachy, but this one simply talks about the present moves, good posture, with simple encouraging words.

This particular video workout requires no additional equipment (though I recommend using a towel, workout mat, or yoga mat for comfort) and can be done as either a solid 35-minute workout, or one of three separate 11-minute workouts.

This DVD shows you three different levels of intensity so you can work through the moves comfortably while still getting in a good workout. The reason I like Pilates is it focuses of precise movement while keeping your core stable.  Even if you only move your leg or arm or whatever 4 inches as long as your core is engaged you are still working out.

Being able to view, simultaneously, all 3 levels of each exercise truly allows for more flexibility to adapt the workout for one's specific needs.

The workout itself certainly does target each area one would like to work on, especially when it comes to deep toning and strengthening without adding, ""bulk"" to muscles.  If you are looking for a means to form a nice lean look, this is the video to try.

However, the beginner level was very elementary, and the intermediate and advanced I felt were on point.  The advanced, however, was not so advanced that it was impossible - I found myself switching between intermediate and advanced levels, depending on the difficulty of the exercise.
All in all I really liked it, and will use it again.  The only thing I wish, was that this had several different Pilates routines to choose from, as opposed to just the one - I could see it becoming boring as you do the same routine over and over.  I will solve this by buying some other videos to mix it up, but that can get expensive!

Addition: I've started adding weights to the arm movements, and putting some on my ankles as well, because while this would get my heart rate up, I didn't really feel the burn the next day like I felt I should.  It gives you a fair amount of arm movements, so adding weights (like 3 lb) really makes you feel it.",1360540800,,1112,4.3951219512195125

The workout is also broken down into 3 segments which are about 10minutes each which makes it much easier to convince myself that I CAN make it through at least 10 minutes before my daughter wakes up, etc...",1356912000,,491,4.384615384615385

It has three different levels, so this feels like three separate programs in one.  I find in most cases I could do the intermediate level, but have to use the beginners level for the pilates move I was new to.  I had to look for it on Amazon because Netflix no longer offer fitness programs (or at least none I prefer or was able to find lately through a search).  I Googled this and hello Amazon! Seriously, this was among my first order with Amazon.  Now, I am an Amazonian ... is this a thing?",1356825600,,606,4.136752136752137

I have done other workouts where the activity keeps on going until you want to die.  This spends the time needed and then moves on.,1355702400,,401,3.9625

Once I got used to the three levels going on at once I loved it.  I really liked how you could customize your workout by doing certain exercises at a harder level and others easier.  It was also great to see what you could possibly work towards - the crazy 3rd level!,1352246400,,383,4.148648648648648
2605801,3,B000GEIRBO,This is the first Ellen Barret workout video that I purchased. If you are a beginner then this is the video for you. The instructor is very encouraging and explains everything and you can follow each level at the same time. Once you move on to doing level two and some level three moves you are ready to move onto a more complex video. Most of the exercised are good except for the one where you are rolling on your back and then balancing. That is kind of weird. I still do this workout on occasion but it is fairly easy for a intermediate level person.,1351555200,,554,4.235849056603773

2605803,5,B000GEIRBO,"I've had this video for about a month and have done it probably an average of once a week (I do another Ellen Barrett DVD more regularly). The first time I did the work out I did the ""easy"" level, level 1, and couldn't believe I could lose weight doing it, because it felt too easy and didn't seem to raise my heart rate at all. The next few times I stuck with Level 2 for most moves, and Level 3 for some of them. I can now see how one could lose weight if you push to Level 3! But what's great is that some of the Level 3 moves don't feel as challenging as others, so for instance, turning a wide squat (Level 2) into a squat-shuffle-squat with arm work (Level 3) is a great addition of cardio, and is relatively easy to do, I can still stick with Level 2 or 1 for say, the push ups, which are tough for me to do without bending my knees. I prefer doing a work out that has cardio in it, such as Ellen's Crunch Fat Burning Pilates DVD (my favorite!), but I like this one for days when I want to do some other sort of cardio separately, or when I want a light day. I think this DVD is a great introduction to Pilates, too.",1349308800,3,1123,3.9298245614035086

2605813,3,B000GEIRBO,"This is a 35 minute pilates workout led by Ellen Barrett. I have done some other pilates videos, but, I just didn't like this workout much at all. There seemed to be too much time explaining the workouts and unchallenging collection of exercises. Ellen leads two background instructors, one who demonstrates beginner Level 1 and one who leads advanced Level 3 (Ellen demonstrates Level 2). Ellen starts everybody off at Level 1, then leads 2&3 onto Level 2, then gives the Level 3 modification. It just seems like it takes along time to progress onto the Level 3 move, which doesn't feel adequately challenging to me.

The standing portion was really slow moving, boring, and repetitive - nothing like her later Studio Fat Burning Fusion or her Crunch workouts. The side mat series was a little better with side plank and leg lifts, but again it moved too slowly and didn't have a congruous flow like other pilates workouts I have done. The mat portion was really not challenging at all.

All in all I would say this might be good for somebody new to pilates because Ellen takes the time to explain the exercises. For somebody who has already been doing pilates, I think they will find this excessive and redundant, even for Ellen fans.",1338940800,4,1236,4.717592592592593

It was nice to step it up a notch on some exercises and take it easier on more challenging ones.  I also liked how they ""block"" each level on the screen so you're not distracted by the other level exercises and can focus on the one you're doing.  It was really cool to mix and match the exercises.  I have used this DVD a couple of times and enjoy the challenge.

I do agree with other reviewers that this is not really aerobic. However, I feel it's a nice Pilates workout with an interesting twist.",1333756800,,661,4.2063492063492065

This workout aims all female ""trouble"" zones; in the beginning it feels like a breath, then gets more challenging, and by the time it's over, I feel tired but not exhausted. The DVD quality is great (both audio and video), Ellen's voice is pleasant, and ability to chose the level of difficulty while exercising is an excellent idea.

I was able to follow along just by modifying which level I did for each exercise and still got an awesome workout. I like the instructor's style of incorporating several short exercises so that no one exercise feels like a mini-torture session like I've experienced in live classes or other DVDs.
I originally watched this as an instant streaming on Netflix, but will be getting the disc to own as well as shopping around for other discs from this instructor!",1330041600,3,634,4.669642857142857
2605824,5,B000GEIRBO,"I love this video. I first bought it when it was new back in 2006. I was brand new to exercise, and I had recently gained quite a bit of weight and I needed to find something that would work for me. I liked the idea of a workout that I could do in my bedroom, barefoot and that didn't require me to do a lot of bouncing around.

In conjunction with a lower calorie diet, I lost 30 lbs in about six months. The first two months, I did this video exclusively. If you're new to exercise, this video can really work for you. It is very customizable, so you start slow and work your way up. It's great because you can do it without feeling intimidated or frustrated. When you're first starting out, it can feel really daunting and it's never a good feeling to start out too intense and suddenly feel like you can't breathe or you have to throw up. You'll never feel like that during this video.

Once you're comfortable with this workout, you can move on to more intense things. This is not a good video for people who have been exercising regularly for more than a month or two. It's a great intro back to exercise and it was very effective for me to start with, but it's not going to get you all the way. But I highly recommend it for any beginner. You'll feel so good the first time you do it - Pilates really loosens up your muscles and makes you feel so limber.

Bottom line: it's great for what it is - a beginner's video. If you're an experienced exerciser or looking for something intense, this isn't it. If you're looking to start exercising for the first time or again after a long break and you want something that will break you in gently, this video is perfect for you.",1326153600,6,1677,4.218068535825545

Originally I thought you would pick a level before the video started and just be stuck with the one level the whole time.  I love that instead there are 3 women doing the different level moves; they start with the level 1, then show you level 2, then show level 3, then do a few more reps at whatever level you feel most comfortable.  I might do one exercise at level 2, the next at level 1, and the next at level 3.  I like that I'm able to continually switch throughout the dvd because all 3 levels are included in one video.  I also enjoy her frequent friendly reminders to maintain the proper positioning, such as reminding me to keep my belly in.  Finally, I love that I feel like I've gotten such a great workout in only 30 minutes.  I would definitely recommend this video.",1323388800,2,912,4.23121387283237

I think the instructor is clear in giving instructions and keeps the pace up.  I do have issues, however, with the overall concept.  There's not a lot of difference between the levels and I think the producers were looking for a way to make  yet another Pilates DVD. Also, the workout isn't as intense as I would like.

I think it's more targeted toward people who are simply out of shape and want to start out a little bit light, getting back into the harder workouts, especially since it does have the three levels. As you continue to use this video you can advance as you go or mix and match the levels to your benefit. I'm out of shape and haven't done much exercise in the last year, I just finished the video and I feel so much better. I have a horrible back so I need something relatively low impact so I don't aggravate it too much.

This video actually made my back feel better, because of the breathing exercise and the movements.

Overall, I think this video is great for beginners and anyone who needs a low-impact workout as part of an everyday lifestyle. It's not too long, but it's not too short, either. I think it's a starting point for people who don't work out much but want to start.",1284854400,2,1383,5.092511013215859

I feel the title is misleading - I'm not sure why they call it ""Weight Loss"" Pilates, as there is no cardio or anything that I can see that could contribute to weight loss.

The video has three different women, showcasing three different levels - with the idea that you can make each move more or less challenging, depending on your fitness level. Unfortunately, I found it all much too slow-paced and extremely easy - even the Level 3 (Advanced) moves. I didn't even work up a sweat and there are so few reps for each move that you start a new move, before you even feel anything from the previous set.

The setting is nice & the video is extremely easy to follow. I would recommend this for people who are new to Pilates or for beginner exercisers who just want to get in a little stretching.",1273363200,,931,4.314285714285714

This is the first step in understanding Pilates.  The only reason I didn't give this one star is because as an exercise video it's fine.  Stop the misadvertising of Pilates.

I am a busy 46 yr old mom of two and exercise is not my thing anymore nor do I have much time to devote to it. I wanted something I could gradually work up to and this set of routines made it easy. Good breathing and cool-down techniques are taught and the instructor is quite pleasant and non-threatening.

After the first few times at the Beginner level, I found I could begin to work in some Intermediate level exercises and pretty soon was able to work in Advanced level exercises. So now, after several months of using this DVD, I feel confident enough to venture into even more challenging workouts. I love that I am feeling good and being physically active again.

2605843,5,B000GEIRBO,I love Ellen Barrett! This dvd is for everyone she makes it easy for you to get a great workout. pick the level best for you and feel great when your done!,1239321600,,155,3.875
2605844,5,B000GEIRBO,"Ellen is an excellent instructor.  Ellen performs the exercises at the intermediate level.  She motivates and gives great form pointers.  There are two other exercisers ones performs at an advanced level and another at the beginner level.

This DVD is chaptered.  The workout takes place in a bright and airy set.  The production is good in that the camera angles and lighting do not interfere with the workout.  All the exercisers are easily seen making it easier for you to follow whatever level you wish. This workout is great in that it makes pilates accessible to all.  The three levels are also great for those days when we feel we want more of a challenge, and for those days when we are not feeling 100%.  I especially liked that this workout included standing pilates moves and then moved on to matwork.  I prefer to have a combination of standing and floor.  It made pilates more enjoyable for me.  Also Ellen's workouts are fusion and therefore not ""pure"" pilates.  So for those who are ""purists"" this might not be the best pilates workout choice for you.

Ellen has a very friendly demeanor.  All of Ellen's workouts leave you feeling relaxed, refreshed and renewed.",1239062400,4,1178,4.762376237623762
2605845,4,B000GEIRBO,"I love Ellen Barret but this video is not the best, I think it has good stuff on it but I was too distracted by all the levels.",1219363200,,127,3.5714285714285716
2605846,3,B000GEIRBO,"I bought this dvd with the intention of building up my skills in pilates, from beginner to advanced over time. The video will definitely help you with weight loss because it keeps your body warm and your blood flowing the whole video. It also provides a good stretch throughout your entire body. However, I've taken pilates classes and have also purchased other videos and found it can be helpful to have further explaination of the pilates moves and proper form. I felt this video lacked this. This video would be helpful for someone who is looking to lose weight and add in some very basic pilates moves, but I felt it had more basic stretching than actual pilates. If I could return the video, I would because it wasn't what I was hoping for. I was a little bored. The instructor is fine, the pace is fine, but it doesn't really focus on classical pilates technique. I recommend this for a beginner or for someone who is easily intimidated by the idea of working out. She makes it very simple and easy to follow along. I would not recommend this for someone who is knowledgable about pilates because you could get bored or frustrated.",1216771200,2,1137,4.578431372549019
2605847,5,B000GEIRBO,"I just love this workout....yet again another favorite of mine from Ellen Barrett.  I've been doing Pilates for a long time and this is a great way to change up my extra at-home workouts.  I started using level 2 but have now been able to progress to level 3 for the most part.

This workout is great for someone starting out since it has 3 fitness levels.  She always starts out in level 1.  Then the level 1 actress stays there while Ellen (who does level 2) and the third actress go to level 2.  And then just the third actress moves to the 3rd and final level.  It's very nice to see the progression to each level and then to see all levels being demonstrated at the same time.

I am so glad I purchased this workout!!",1211932800,,722,4.181159420289855
2605848,5,B000GEIRBO,"I had never tried Pilates before this video, yet it was extremely easy to follow.  As long as you do the exercises correctly you will get a phenomenal workout and tone up quickly (while being able to adjust your level accordingly).  I have tried everything throughout the years and after having 2 kids I; 1- wasn't able to get that last 6-8 pounds off, 2- was never able to have tone abs and, 3- did not have time to go to a gym.  The workout is only 30 minutes.... and doing it 3-4 times a week I lost the weight (& then some- with my same diet) and have never been so tone in my life!  The video is deceptive in that you don't feel like you are killing yourself working out but if done appropriately you will get a great workout.  I would (& do) suggest it to everyone.",1201305600,16,771,4.113333333333333
2605849,4,B000GEIRBO,"I really enjoy using this DVD, because you can pick your level. Some exercises I can use level 1 but others I can go up to either level 2 or 3. I like it because it seems to go real quick and i don't have to go buy a new dvd, when say one of the levels becomes too easy for me I can just go on up to the next level.",1199145600,,315,3.388888888888889
2605850,3,B000GEIRBO,"This would have been a great short workout, except for the way it was presented. You waste so much time at the lower exertion levels that you will very quickly outgrow it, never mind getting any kind of a cardio workout.

It should have had either separate workout levels to choose from, or the level 2 and 3 exercisers should have started with their modifications from the beginning. A separate instruction section covering each exercise would also have made the workouts far more effective by eliminating all the explanation downtime.

The included 7-day eating plan is pretty good.",1190764800,,584,4.948979591836735
2605851,5,B000GEIRBO,"I like this DVD because it is not boring or repetitive. You don't get tired of it over time! I have had it a while now, and go back to it once in a while. I currently do more aerobic workouts but this one is very good for toning. You do feel like you get a good workout and it's nice you can pick different levels to work at, from easier to harder levels.",1173139200,7,355,3.810810810810811

8130958,5,B000GEIRBO,"I primarily do Ellen Barrett workouts, I really love her approach and how she mixes all different types of exercises together. I didn't have some of her older dvds so wanted to get them.  It's harder to find them but glad i could get this one. Love the variety with the different levels. It's great for when you feel like you have more energy then other days. I really recommend this if you would like different options it's great to prevent boredom; you can always go up a level. Glad i purchased it.",1521072000,,501,4.387096774193548
8130959,5,B000GEIRBO,"I really like this DVD, I chose it because it had the three levels of difficulty showing at the same time.

8130962,5,B000GEIRBO,Having Fibromyalgia I can't do extremely intense workouts so this video is perfect! It has 3 levels to work with and you can definitely feel the impact after. It's easy and definitely doable everyday. Love the instructor as well!,1469577600,,229,4.897435897435898
8130963,3,B000GEIRBO,"I purchased this Weight Loss Pilates video as a co-worker recommended Pilates to help me achieve a more toned look. I was drawn to this particular video because, being new to Pilates, I wanted the ability to ""pick my level"" to insure it would not be too fast-paced or difficult for me to do, as I am really out of shape, overweight and not flexible at all.

However, I was rather disappointed by this DVD as it was not challenging *at all* - and my 13 year old was able to do the same moves as shown in the video with zero effort and she's not very athletic either.

An essential component of any good weight loss workout is cardio - and this video really did not provide any of that at all. I didn't even break a sweat - and during an intense yoga session, I am usually sweating my tail off!

The overall pace of this video is extremely slow and as previously mentioned, laughably easy. Normally after a successful workout session, I can ""feel"" it in my muscles and limbs - I finished this entire DVD and honestly did not feel any different than before I began, unless you count the disappointment I felt.

That being said, this DVD *is* extremely easy to follow along to, so perhaps some beginners would prefer this style of video. Being a beginner myself, I just found that this is too low level and more of a glorified stretching routine (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but I do not see any weight loss benefits as the title implies.

If you are looking for an easy introductory video and you have zero experience in Pilates, I would recommend this to you as it perhaps would meet those beginner needs. I myself will be looking for something that offers a bit more of a challenge.",1466985600,3,1690,4.386581469648562

8130966,5,B000GEIRBO,This is a great pilates dvd. There are three people to follow along with for different experience and/or fitness levels and the pace is easy to keep up with. I have used many different exercise videos and this is one of my favorites.,1459123200,,233,4.441860465116279
