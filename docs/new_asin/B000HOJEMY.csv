2639462,5,B000HOJEMY,"This is a wonderful movie that ended, perhaps, as it should have, but not how I would have wished.  The young man is a rather handsome, loney guys totally devoted to his students, yet lonely and not finding what he needs in the women in his life.  He is intreagued by a rather nice looking boy in his class.  The two become friends, spend time together, and their relationship grows.  While nothing blatent or offensive,it is a beautiful portrayal of how important a young boy can be in a man's life, and how important a young man can be in a boys life.  Tasteful, well written and acted, and some beautiful scenery.  The movie is wonderful, and believable.  The ending, I would have re written...",1307145600,28,697,4.528
2639463,4,B000HOJEMY,"It was probably ok , for its time, Its a little bit slow, but is well acted, and it has a good script after all, see it, You ll find hard to get the original in dvd, most of them are copies from a VHS",1252108800,7,200,3.466666666666667
2639464,5,B000HOJEMY,"Everything about this movie is classic, not one of those low-budget type movies at all, as the cover may suggest.  The quality of the acting is superb, with room for subtle nuances.  While there is plenty of ""unspoken"" communication in the movie, there is almost always dialogue, which keeps this movie much more natural for an American viewer.  The dialogue itself is always natural.

The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't delve into overly controversial scenes.  The friendship portrayed evolves naturally and not hastily or unnaturally imposed on the characters, as other films seem to do, and there is enough emphasis on other relationships in the film to make it interesting.

Italian culture is also well-woven into the film, for those who are interested in the cultural aspects.",1213315200,32,798,5.0534351145038165
2639465,4,B000HOJEMY,"When I ordered this movie, I was not too sure what I was going to find.
Imagine: a boy, his young teacher, relations outside the school!!!
What is the game?
Until the end of the movie you'll never be sure what side shall win.
I loved it.",1208390400,19,237,4.0638297872340425
2639466,4,B000HOJEMY,"I enjoyed this movie, however, I was looking for more.  The plot gets boggled down with the relationship between Lorenzo and his girlfriend who is engaged to another man.  Lorenzo is a beautiful man, however, he seems incapable to sort out his emotional ties with the woman and the boy.  The setting of the movie is beautiful, and the language is superb.  I love to hear movies in Italian.

I was left wanting for Lorenzo.  He was such a virile man, however he is the one left with nothing.",1180396800,2,490,4.449438202247191

8140597,5,B000HOJEMY,"This production is a good commentary on the culture in parts of Europe around the Mediterranean.  On first impression some Westerners would be offended by a young boy starting puberty who holds the hands of a man or even kisses him.  The real purpose of this movie is
to demonstrate what a positive influence a young boy can have on a young man's life.  The young man is a teacher, the young boy is one of his students, and the young boy's adult sister becomes involved with the Teacher.  What develops is not a typical love triangle.  The parents of the young boy come to realize their Son would not be molested or harmed in any way by the young Teacher.  Whether on a farm in a rural town or a city, it is a challenging world for a young boy to grow up or a novice to begin a career of teaching.  This is an excellent movie that
demonstrates life at its best and worst.",1407542400,2,871,4.210843373493976
8140598,5,B000HOJEMY,"Im writing this hours after having seen ""The taste of Corn"".  This very moving and fantastic film is interwoven meticulously creating a very heavy suspenseful drama with a subject matter most would consider very taboo.  However, Lorenzo Lena manages to create sympathy and even empathy as we see his plight given a very inappropriate situation.  Making matters worse, the family loves him and may have an idea of what is really going on.  It is a difficult subject matter to undergo, but the film beautifully presents the conflicts with honesty, warmth & heart.  If you can find this 1986 movie, you must give yourself an opportunity to experience this gem of a film.  You won't regret it.  simply put... engaging and outstanding.",1380326400,,730,4.934426229508197
8140599,3,B000HOJEMY,"This is a movie about a straight man confused with his filling for a young boy who is infatuated with him.
It's not real clear that the boy is gay, but it is clear the older guy is straight he seems to fall in love with a
local girl. But I do think he loves the younger boy, because he knows the boy loves him in a way that's not typical.
This is a movie about young infatuation and it's sweet to see the young boy fall in ""love"".",1367452800,3,430,3.842696629213483
8140600,3,B000HOJEMY,"I watched this short film and was not too elated.  There is an important pschological lession, though.  The interaction with the farmers is a must to watch.",1344902400,,156,4.7407407407407405
8140601,5,B000HOJEMY,"The Flavor of Corn is a very lovable film that tells of a young teacher with a rather offputting girlfriend (shown quite explicitly together) who also finds himself to some extent responding to a young male pupil's pubescent crush on him. It could be sensationalist but in fact it is very reserved and the feelings are well shown in all their fragility. The boy in particular brings a real intensity to his portrayal which is very convincing; he is altogether a very likeable lad who is fond of his grandfather and respectful of everyone. The family are sort-of aware of their son's feelings - they are very much a farming family and slightly in awe of the teacher, and very hospitable. The mother in particular tries to put the brakes on something she sees as dangerous, but not in an unpleasant way, while the father is very generous in spirit towards the novice teacher. They are very reasonable people (the mother played by Marina Vlady whose presence gives the whole film an added prestige factor). The images are beautiful and the music oddly touching - it carries quite a lot of the emotion and genuinely involves the heart of the viewer. There's a moment when the boy gives his tutor a model boat and the latter just sits at his kitchen table looking at it. It doesn't sound like much but the music conveys all the emotional import of the gift and the slightly perplexed but touched reaction of the young man.",1331769600,12,1417,4.626984126984127
8140602,5,B000HOJEMY,"I enjoyed this movie very much. It had a good ending (no arrests or incarceration) I liked the boy who played Duillio. The teacher was very responsible. The teacher (called professor, in some european countries) was a young man. He forms a close attachment to Duillio. He even spends some time at the boys house. Even gives the boy viewpoints on things like art and other life issues. This movie should not be shown to anyone under sixteen. There are several intimate lovemaking sessions between the teacher and other adult women. However I do love Italian that was spoken in this movie. Nice production, if you don't mind some of the sexual interludes.",1323734400,8,653,4.787610619469026
8140603,5,B000HOJEMY,"I was moved by this film, and by its simple and yet solid plot. This is one of those movies that linger on your mind long after you've watched it. My head was full of questions and I'm still thinking about them.
I wonder what Lorenzo really felt for the boy. Was it the affection of an older brother or was there something else? I tend to go for the second option, although it was clear that he felt uncomfortable with it. The moment he kisses Adalgisa, it gave me the impression that he wished it was Duilio.
Then again, it may be just my imagination.
Someone said it ended the way it should, although there could have been a different ending. I guess I agree.
In a nutshell, it is a film well worth watching, and I'm happy I bought it.",1315267200,9,737,4.197183098591549
