8684521,5,B00OQQPA8Q,Dont like this one.  I prefer more kettle pushes.  Not so much core work.,1519084800,,73,4.142857142857143
8684522,5,B00OQQPA8Q,"This is the fourth Katami DVD I've purchased and used. Great workout, fast-paced and challenging. 30 second sessions with 10 seconds in between...just enough to catch your breath for a second and understand what you're supposed to do next.  As I do it enough and know what's coming next, I can use more time to catch my breath!  I use a 35 lb kettlebell for this workout.",1504569600,,371,4.522388059701493

8684527,5,B00OQQPA8Q,"Paul Katami is one of my favorite kettlebell instructors so I was really excited to come across this dvd. This workout assumes you have a basic understanding of kettlebell moves, so I would not recommend it for someone just starting out - Ultimate Kettlebell Workouts for Beginners is a great Paul Katami dvd to start with - but this is a fun and challenging fast-paced workout. I love the timer on the screen and the fact that each drill is only 30 seconds. Great new addition to my workout collection.",1430956800,2,503,4.6
