3934366,5,B002HQK5O6,"Family Guy may have been a rip-off of the Simpsons, which in the legal world is call an homage or parady, but this show stands quite well on its own, particularly in the first few seasons before it was cancelled the first time IMHO. I am a much bigger fan of the Simpsons, and I have grown tired of Seth's ideals and attitude showing through in this show, but I can honestly say it has better staying power than the Simpsons has in probably ten years. Seasons 1 & 2 have some great writing and every episode is enjoyable. If you're a fan this is a good place to start.",1334102400,4,568,4.172727272727273
