8239300,5,B00020X8OI,"The Pegan type assembly, as Boyd Rice explains, was the most Pirated NON footage up to a certain point I believe. Readings from Might is Right, truly gives sheds a brutal emotion that makes you think. I know he did Roman military salutes and all that, I read his internal paper about how he wasn't involved in the concept of Nazism. How he was watched closely by European authorities, and he was explain how he never wanted to present the ascethic of a ""Nazi"" and how he avoids ""Fascist"" salutes, I used this to learn about NON and Boyd Rice, I want to know more, he's such a interesting figure. I was called out and called an idiot by a fan of Boyd Rice, and I don't understand why. ""You don't seem very intelligent, I don't know how you found NON""
Meh, I don't respond to non constructive criticisms. I just want to learn more about the ideolgy from Boyd Rice. I think mostly it was because of the bias assumption of Christianity and scapegoats.",1439942400,,947,4.417142857142857
8239301,5,B00020X8OI,"A COMMAND PERFORMANCE!!  Boyd Rice steps to the podium and its breathtaking, but this could never be a tour, Political Correctness is FASCISM with good manners here, and the name Boyd Rice is in the top 10, followed by Manson and Hitler.  You cant talk about these people w/o someone getting offended, and being offended is just something we cant handle here.  Everybody has to be 'nice' now, tolerant.  What we cant tolerate is a genius, someone that stood up(thats a Taxi Driver loop he uses)and says something that only the few can handle, being offended is a feeling we have when we don't like or fully understand something we react in hate or fear of it.  We need strong influences today, and when one watches this w/o bias, you will see its truth, that Might is right, and yes, we want TOTAL WAR.",1421625600,,802,4.541666666666667

It's great to finally have this footage, the video from which the live portion of the <em>In the Shadow of the Sword</em> album is lifted, on DVD. That said, if you were expecting anyone to have actually <em>done</em> anything to the footage during the DVD transfer--you know, like remastering it--you will likely be disappointed. It's still fuzzy, grainy, hard to make out much of anything that's going on. And the sound quality is identical to that on the CD (it's the fuzziest, most bootleg-sounding recording on my list of 100 favorite albums). If you've already seen the VHS version and you've got the album, you can safely pass on this until there's an attempt at a remastered version. ***",1347321600,,759,4.9763779527559056
