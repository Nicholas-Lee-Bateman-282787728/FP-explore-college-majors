7669502,5,B01BUQ70AU,"I love this series, both manga and anime. I've seen both seasons as well as read both Tokyo Ghoul and :Re. I loved this season even though it's a lot different than the manga. I'm a sucker for tragedy so this adaption and having Kaneki show more humility and emotion than in the manga appealed to me. I loved the soundtrack..aside from the opening song and hearing Unravel in acoustic was incredible. I love Juuzou so getting to see more of him and more of his back story animated was great. You should really watch shows and judge for your own before blindly following reviews online, good or bad. But I personally think this season is worth the watch, especially if you enjoyed the first season, or even just the overall idea of this story.",1459728000,13,742,4.503703703703704

7669504,5,B01BUQ70AU,"Iv read both manga (:re on ch. 69 right now). Season 2 could have been better of course but its still an incredible story. Quality is great. The show got ahead of the anime during production and deviated a bit from source material. Not as bad as Akame ga kill tho. I grew up with ruroni kenshin, trigun and dbz. If you were a fan of those you simply owe it to yourself to give this one a shot assuming youv season season 1. Dont listen to the negative reviews. Everything cant be one punch man (TG is so much better!!). They take a different path to reach the same ending as the manga basically. With a slight twist. A bunch of stuff was left out of course. TG universe can never fit into 25 episodes. So once you finish this, read the manga of course!! Even if you never usually do. Its number one for a reason.",1458604800,7,812,4.1455696202531644

7669506,1,B01BUQ70AU,"Just skip to the ending songs, they all has a different set of end cards drawn by the author which is very nice.

I love the Tokyo Ghoul series but this was a mediocre animation and doesn't do the series any justice.

Please save your money on this purchase and read the manga instead as the original story is actually good.",1457654400,2,324,4.295081967213115

7669508,2,B01BUQ70AU,"Sorta strays off from the original source and just overall isn't as good.  I mean if you are absolutely obsessed with Tokyo Ghoul then by all means spend 40-60 smackaroos buying this but the quality in story just isn't as good as the source material and is a major downgrade from Season 1.

Do yourself a favor and just read the manga.",1457049600,7,335,4.387096774193548
7669509,3,B01BUQ70AU,"Tokyo Ghoul was one of the most highly anticipated and well-received shows of its year. People loved it, as did I. The story was a tad confusing with all of its twists and turns, things which were better explained in the manga, but it was a jolly good show when it came to atmosphere, character development, animation, and overall entertainment value. People complain about the ending, but I think it was good for something we knew would have a second season; it ended on a climax, when Kaneki's character completely transforms. Of course, I picked it up when the 2nd season was just airing, so I didn't have to wait long to bridge the gap. And where did this bridge lead me?
To an island of disappointment.
The show is sapped of most of its entertaining factors. Enjoyable characters are pushed to the sidelines, we are treated to heavy doses of teenage angst with little payoff, and the story hops around faster than a rabbit chased by an owl. It is quite confusing, and not a whole lot of fun to watch. Pretty, granted, but not fun. The action scenes are amazing, and these story boarders really know how to milk every ""Acting Moment."" The songs are similar to the first season, so no real praise or anger to be given there. Some new characters, or, rather, very minor characters, show up and have cool moments, but there is no emotional connection to them because we hardly knew them ( I'm looking at you three, white-haired super-slayer, Ape-Man and Dober...Woman). Instead, we get to follow the guys hunting the ghouls, who are an interesting bunch, but I really despise that kid with the stitches. I'd personally rather follow the ghouls and their world, but a break in perspective is sometimes welcome. If anything, I blame poor-pacing and character development on the story and its ADHD.
But that's not the reason for three stars. Oh, no.
The real reason I award three stars (which I do not really consider an award) to the second season, while I'd give five to the first, is poor Kaneki Ken. Centipede-Kun gets beat around like a sack of flour this entire series. That is, when he actually SHOWS UP. Kaneki was our focus the entire first season. It was his struggle to remain human that was so interesting, and gave us any emotional attachment to the show. How do we react when the most likable character is shoved on the sidelines? Not very well; Kaneki was the draw of the show, the main attraction, and the source of everything truly great about the story. By back staging him, and then allowing his sorry rump to get handed to him time and time again when he has supposedly become so ultra-powerful, is just sad. I actually felt pity for the poor guy, and was rather upset because he just could never win, no matter how much sanity he lost. The problem was that he started off as our central protagonist, and slowly slumped into role of major character. We don't know what he's thinking, his emotions, what he plans to do, his motives, nothing; Kaneki Ken becomes a stranger to us when we knew him so well in the first series. There are many flaws that can be overlooked in an anime, but this is the first I've seen of its kind, and I daresay it is the biggest blow to the show. Oh, yes, by the way; the second season ends on the same kind of cliffhanger the first did. Though I think the production studio can recover with the next season, I can at least understand why the fans are demanding for a remake; take my word as you see fit.",1456876800,17,3450,4.503987240829346

7669511,1,B01BUQ70AU,"So uh $70 is sorta alot.
Episodes 4 and 5 of Root A never even happened and replace a very important arc that happens in the books thats needed to Understand Tokyo Ghoul :re.
Root A is not Canon, meaning this is more a seperate and somewhat different (not really, its just a mess) story.
Half the story/fights were basically copy and paste from the manga while still trying to add its own details.. Almost destroying any chance of adapation of the second half of the manga (aka the actual Season 2)
 The Opening Music and Ending Music are decent. Oh and btw for Manga readers who haven't watched this yet there is No Kaneki vs Arima fight. Which was kinda stupud not to...
Root A leaves out MANY MANY things even for what-if scenario.... 1. The Clowns aren't introduced properly and revealed.. 2. V is sorta introduced but not really. The Eto vs Arima fight happens earlier than expected and Juzo does not his leg to Yoshimura. Kaneki only has like about 35 minutes of screen time and in those minutes he is horrible. He acts all emo, when he never was

  But yeah alot of Manga readers hate Root A. But yeah If you really want to watch this though, i suggest you read the manga first... The manga is the true story of Kaneki...  I'm not sure if ill get this though. $70 is sorta alot. Season 1 was $50",1456704000,7,1302,4.341563786008231

7669533,5,B01BUQ70AU,"- Synopsis: A sequel to the first season. Things heat up as new enemies threaten the peace that they have known for some time. The next set of bloody battles will be the fiercest they have seen yet. The city is once again engulfed in a sea of blood as ghouls and doves alike battle each other to the death. Tune in to see how the fate of our protagonist and his friends draw to a suspenseful conclusion as they once again, fight with their lives on the line.
===========================================================================================================

- Comments: If you are not into blood and gore, I suggest staying away. I typically don't watch really violent animes, but I think this is reasonably violent. Especially compared to the beginning of Elfen Lied. I couldn't even finish the first episode of that anime due to the extreme amounts of carnage portrayed in the anime. But we all find our tolerance levels with trial-and-error.

The story becomes much more serious, as well. And the fighting intensifies. Which makes sense if this is the final conclusion of the series.

- Analysis: The anime also has an interesting implication regarding ghouls. For what purpose do they exist? Perhaps to weed out the human population to prevent overpopulation or more of a survival of the fittest perspective? Maybe to punish humans for their sins, from a more religious standpoint. Or maybe they exist as evidence of humans that have evolved? Some of these concepts make for good thought-provoking material.

- Features: English and Japanese audio with English subtitles. Includes 12 episodes on 2 Blu-rays, and 12 episodes on 2 DVDs. The run-time is about 5 hours and is rated TV-MA for violence, and blood and gore.

The entire season was basically one large war that continuously progresses throughout each episode. I'm so glad there was some closure, but I will say there are times when you are like ""what now""? It's a really good watch, Ken is not the same person as he was from the first season, but yet he still holds to that bit of humanity inside of him in the end.

The two encased amarays that hold the DVDs and Blu-ray discs are sturdy and decorated with even more good art. It's a fine collection to have on your shelf.

As for the show itself, I'd say that even though the plot deviates from the story of the Manga it is based on, it still does a great job of being entertaining and at times, very tear-jerking.

There is too much needless talking between characters and not enough action. When there IS action, it's terribly executed, not at all like Season 1. The action scenes are composed literally of someone lunging at another person, killing them or having them block and immediately kill the first person. So bad.

8751565,2,B01BUQ70AU,"tokyo ghoul root a wasn't good, but it was better than the second half of the manga it adapted (not counting cutting half of the battle out with ravin in the first episode).  The manga is just a ton of set up followed but no pay offs with every pothole dropped for a forced battle ending that made little sense and resolved nothing.  the main characters die off early leaving characters we barely know or care about to duke it out for an extended amount of time.  By the end, I didn't care who won: doves or owl.  At least root a made the good sense to keep the main characters alive throughout most of the last battle, and make that blue haired girl a main character again-she is basically absent from the manga and what little time she gets is pointless to the overall story.  And so what if the main character joined the enemy group?  Him forming his own group in the manga was pretty pointless: it was nothing but swallow characters and plot points that were never interesting or able to amount to much.  The gourmet got overused also and reduced to a vegeta like villain from the later half of dbz.  The anime may be bad, but the manga was godawful due to its terrible ending that made everything up to the point feel like a waste of time since literally none of the long running plots got resolved.  Heck, most of them ended still shrouded in mysteries we never got any answers to.  The anime ignored most of these empty plots, and I felt less cheated by the end.  The anime's biggest issue is they had a lot of space to fill between the first episode and the battle that takes of the last 3.  They clearly had no idea what to do, so they created a lot of pointless filler.  Up until the end, the series feels like a waste of time; and the ending is a bit of a let down.  It's not bad, but it's not great either.  Outside of no story, the most serious issue this season faces is a complete lack of any tonal consistency.  The series can go from corny, cute humor when the heroes are together-like the type of cringe worthy humor you see in terrible, cringe worthy children's anime-to ultra-violent, gory battles.  The original series had some issues with tone, but this series takes it to an absolute extreme.  Sometimes, the humorous parts were embarrassing to watch and made me wonder if i was even still watching tokyo ghoul.  And, if this was in fact tokyo ghoul, was it being aimed at children?  Then--BAM, decapitations and blood everywhere.  Then, more childish humor.  It's jarring, to say the least, and it's a terrible mix.  No fans of cutesy humor will like the ultra-violence and vice versa.  Finally, the series, like the manga, lacks the ability to kill anyone important off.  When they finally get the guts to actually kill two characters off, they are background characters who get way too much attention aimed at them right before there deaths.  There's a major battle going on with all these characters i actually care about from the first season, and these two nobodies interrupt this major battle to slowly die over the course of an entire episode.  I cared so little about them going into this last battle that I found myself hoping they'd just hurry up and die already so the story could return to the characters i actually cared about.  If they had died earlier during this series downtime, it would have been a lot better than interrupting life or death battles between major characters for so long to just kill off some pointless, annoying background characters, whose entire personality could easily be summed up by a lame one-note joke up to this point.  Overall, this series had promise.  It broke away from the manga and did it's own thing.  Considering how terrible the second half of the manga was, this was def a good thing.  It had good, strong characters built up from the first season and some loose plot points it could focus on also.  This series had a chance to be great with some luck.  It should have at least been good, but it wastes this chance by doing nothing with the core characters until the very end.  Overall, the second season just feels forgettable (but, at least, it didn't leave me feeling cheated like the manga).",1525305600,,4173,4.503989361702128

8751567,4,B01BUQ70AU,"Ive mixed feelings about this season. Part of it were excellent; the backstory of the CCG and its inevitable conflect with the Anteiku ghouls had all the dramatic pathos it possessed in the manga, which could be channeled into a moving medium, emphasizing the drama of conflict. This was beautifully done and left me sympathizing with both sides of the conflict.

Parts left me crying, feeling like Id been robbed. Kanekis descent into madness was beautiful, but I felt like the character Id come to love during Season 1 had been gutted of much of his complexity, a complexity which was explored in the manga, but was neutered in the second season. Even worse, Tsukiyamas character arc and evolution from a stalker to someone who truly cared about Kaneki was gone. Only the ending remained and it was hard to comprehend without any of the build up. The absence of the quest for Rize and Dr. Kano leaked much of the drama from Kanekis encounters with the other one-eyed ghouls.

Kanekis decision to join Aogiri Tree made no sense to me. I kept waiting for more of an explanation, a scene with Ayato to reveal they were plotting together. The vague comments about Kaneki seeking power didn't quite resonate, especially with how little we got of the main character and his reasons for changing. Banjos role in Kanekis backstory was also nonexistent.

The one character who got delved into a bit more was Touka. Her moments were dramatic, rich, and deep enough to convey her motivations and why she ended where she did.

Im furious at what got left out. Im really hoping for a Season B which puts some of it back in or gives more explanation for whats going on with Kaneki and Tsukiyama. At the same time, the anime was first rate at times.

For overall plot, quality, and character development, this gets four stars. Some of the characters were beautifull developed. There were times during which it was hard to turn away. I just wish more of the story in the manga had been left in.",1515974400,,1980,4.645714285714286
