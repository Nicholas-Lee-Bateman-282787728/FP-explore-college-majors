8754624,4,B01D1GN2V8,"I love these ITV murder series, like ""Appropriate Adult,""  which are moody and extremely well-acted. James Nesbitt gave a great performance though I would have like to have seen a closer resemblance to the real Colin Howell. The fact that the actual murders were portrayed completely added to the horror of the act. The trial especially warrants second viewing. Would recommend!",1491523200,,378,5.19672131147541
