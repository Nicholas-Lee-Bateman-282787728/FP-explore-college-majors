7892998,3,6305705135,"Good video. Vividly recreates the St. Louis Rams in their championship season. The rams were a huge surprise. They weren't expected to win the Super Bowl. Then their quarterback was injured and Kurt Warner had a great season. If you're a Rams fan,
a must have.",1388880000,,260,4.673913043478261
7892999,4,6305705135,"One of the top 20 QBs in Pro

Football history. Dominated

the Indoor Pro Game first,

then the outdoor one! Great

team that Dick Vermiel put

together. I was rooting for

them even though I am not a

natural Rams fan. I saw Kurt

tear it up in two ArenaBowls

and knew that is some smart

NFL team picked him up they'd

go all the way! A serious error

in here though; they say he play-

ed two years of Arenaball; actu-

ally they mean in two ArenaBowls.

He played the first three years in

the Ar. FL, not two. Then a spring

European vaction, Amsterdam, paid

for by the NFL.",1150329600,,581,4.081081081081081
7893000,1,6305705135,"This movie was good but titans should have got way more credit, and I don't mean that because I am a titans fan but they pretty much talked mostly about the rams. Plus if this game took place today, Dyson would have got the touchdown since of now its if the ball is over the endzone and before it wasn't then titans would have one in overtime. So they are looking at it like the rams were so great but it was such a close game that it they almost lost and probably would have lost if the touchdown counted so they should add more titans to it but still keep a lot of rams in the move.",1107129600,,584,3.957627118644068
7893001,1,6305705135,"By the title of this video, it appeared to me that it contained Super Bowl XXXIV.  why call it that if it goes all the way through the Ram's season and when thy get to the super bowl, they give it the same attention as the other games.  Also I am a Ram's fan, but if this video is about Super Bowl XXXIV, the Tenessee Titans deserve more credit than they got.  There could not have been two more evenly matched teams (each in their own way) in that game than if it were rigged.  I'll tell you, the Titans did a great job and sure had me on the edge of my seat.  The game could have gone either way, had Mike Jones slipped and fell on his tush.  From now on, let's call a dog a dog and a cat a cat.",984355200,6,697,3.8055555555555554
7893002,5,6305705135,"This tape is really a summary of the Rams unbelievable 1999-2000 season. The Super Bowl highlights only make up the final quarter of the tape (albeit an outstanding final 15 minutes). As a NFL/Rams fan since 1970,  this past season made up for many years of frustration. The game-by-game  highlights are expertly edited and cut with player interviews, sideline  & locker room banter and ""miked""  comments from coach  Vermeil. Although the plays by Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk, and Issac Bruce  are emphasized, there are more than enough clips of the other offensive  players, the defense & the special teams to spotlight whomever your  favorite Ram might be.  The excitement of the season builds until the final  tackle of Super Bowl XXXIV. Coach Vermeil's final celebration scenes are  priceless!  Although I watched every Rams game this season, this video is  still well worth the price.  A perfect gift for any football fan but an  absolute necessity for any true Rams fan! Then again, I may be a bit  biased.",956793600,10,1012,4.934523809523809
7893003,5,6305705135,"This tape will bring you to tears.  Tears of joy. The smiling face of Todd Lyght (the last man standing from L.A) in the final credits, will touch your heart if you are one of the many who vicariously followed Rams through  the tough times, and suffered the losses along with Lyght.
This was the  Greatest Season any team ever had. So many stories of rags to riches.  I  can't watch it without getting emotional. The kick off runs by Horne just  when we needed it.  A coach returning after burnout to tend to unfinished  business.
Last seasons third stringer QB, like Moses, to lead his  people to the promise land.
Keith Lyle, who said other teams called them  the Lambs his entire career.
Marshall Faulk who's skills are unmatched.  Ricky Prohels heroics.
Bruce, the greatest St. Louis Ram ever, with the  greatest St. Louis TD ever.
And Mike Jones, who stopped the Music in  Music City.
Before the Season, I was going to edit the other season  highlight tapes together to pretend we won the Super Bowl. The Rams beat me  to it!
This is a great tape. Great rewatchability power. Buy two copies  because you will wear this one out. In the words of Kurt Warner,  ""Thank you Jesus! """,956448000,15,1182,4.5

7893005,5,6305705135,"If you like Ever After and football too. you are going to love this. ""Go to go to work"" the Rams slogan, is something every normal human being can relate to.",950918400,9,157,4.096774193548387
