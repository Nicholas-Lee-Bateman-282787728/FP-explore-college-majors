8181850,5,B000NVIGG6,"This is absolutely, positively, my most favorite workout DVD ever!! It covers ALL the basics (cardio, 2 weights sections, toning, and stretching) and it's fast-paced and super fun! I love that the 2 main instructors (Janis Saffell and Guillermo Gomez) trade off teaching the sections. I have videos of both of them on their own, and frankly, they aren't as good as they are together! I SO wish they had more videos together - I'd buy them all!",1262995200,,443,4.6923076923076925
8181851,5,B000NVIGG6,Not really for beginners though.  And don't be fooled like me because I actually bought this one thinking it was different than the one I got a few years ago with a different cover....it wasn't.  Still love the DVD though.,1216339200,,222,4.525
8181852,2,B000NVIGG6,"I wanted ""Hardcore Kickbox Circuit"" with Janis Saffell & Guillermo Gomez as recommended by a friend.  Yet upon its arrival I realized that the DVD was slightly different than my friend's version.  This DVD is manufactured under license from New York Media Group and my friend's was distributed by Guillermo Gomez's Company ""Dynamic Zen"".  Guillermo's version shows a clearer picture of Janis and a photo of himself wearing boxing gloves.  The main difference in the DVD is that the viewer may not choose their workout in this version as they can on Guillermo's version - keep that in mind.  This latest workout is probably best described as cardio boxing. The workout is mixed-impact and contains sequences of punches, boxers shuffle, jacks, and some strength moves such as push-ups with club beats for the background music. This workout is best for an intermediate level of fitness but easily adaptable for lower or higher levels.  Janis Saffell's moves are fun and engaging - although a little more dancey at times.  I enjoyed this video; kept me moving and sweating.  Guillermo is indeed 'dynamic'; he always cues the moves well and when he says ""Vamos!"" you'll want to work harder!",1191110400,7,1185,4.979695431472082
