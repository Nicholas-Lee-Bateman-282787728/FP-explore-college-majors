I can watch these DVDs over and over and never tire. If you love gliding over snow effortlessly, then these DVD's are for you. The avid snow-sports enthusiast will enjoy the beauty, endlessly inventive the action-cinematography is with xczone films, undoubtedly, a pioneer in outdoor aerobic sports filmmaking.",1144108800,7,455,5.08
2553391,5,B000F6YVQS,"Everything you ever need to know about Nordic Skiing Technique, can be found on this one disk, from the same xczone.tv studios referred to as the Warren Miller' of Nordic Skiing, this is the only instructional DVD on the sport written, directed and produce by World-Class skiers with a professional studio at their disposal.  Not only is the quality and quantity (5 hours +) of the technical content superb, but the cinematography is breathtaking. The disk itself is state-of-the-art (DVD9 Dolby Digital, Multi-viewing angles, alternative voice tracks, special features, mp3, DVD-ROM content etc).  Man! this is interactive.  Using the remote I could flip angles on skiers, look at how it is done in a World Cup race, or switch to an alternative analysis by coaches.  The narrative script and even video can be downloaded onto an ipod for a long ski, or to use as a aid when I taught my students. This product is absolutely jam packed with knowledge, beyond what I could absorb at one sitting. I am not sure that anyone could pack-in so such high-quality knowledge onto one disk. It is clear from the presentation as to why this curriculum and teaching method has been adopted for professional skiing certification.",1144108800,10,1215,4.9411764705882355
8118078,1,B000F6YVQS,"I can't understand for the life of me why this has received so many good reviews. The video production alone is so trite, played out, and repetitive that just trying to navigate through it is almost impossible. I bought this to take over where books left off. BAD IDEA. The books I have are from the 70's and they do a better job of explaining and certainly are more detailed. The video glosses over many things except skating. If you like skating, this is your video. I feel like I'm missing something...Half the video is an info-mercial for: The video. I just don't get it. Go take a lesson instead. The price is the same and you walk away with some knowledge. However, it is kinda fun to watch them clown around on XC skis. It is pretty amazing. The pros in the video really do know how to ski, but the ""how to do it"" part never gets effectively translated to the viewer. I wish Amazon would take it back.",1297987200,,908,4.315789473684211
8118079,4,B000F6YVQS,"This video is amateurishly produced but the instruction is sound. The assumption is that the viewer knows nothing about cross-country skiing, therefore everything is explained simply, repetitiously in detail, which is good. All types of cross-country skiing is covered from traditional to skating and techniques and styles are demonstrated for various types of terrain.",1251849600,,369,5.851851851851852
8118080,5,B000F6YVQS,This is a great video that you can watch over and over to fine tune your skate technique. The best instructional video I've seen. Worth every penny.  Buy it!,1235088000,,157,4.413793103448276
8118081,4,B000F6YVQS,"The information in this DVD has been very helpful.  I took a lesson when I first started skate-skiing and I ended up stuck with the ""nose-knee-toe"" theory.  I have been so frustrated when I have been trying to ski faster and found out from this DVD why the ""n-k-t"" technique has been causing problems for me.  There is excellent instruction - both with video and verbal explanations.

The reason I gave this DVD a 4 star rating, is there is an odd graphic that divides EVERY SINGLE teaching segment.  This was VERY annoying!!",1203638400,3,525,4.602150537634409
8118082,1,B000F6YVQS,The production of this DVD is a disaster. We are endlessly submitted to long visual effect transitions between every bit of usable information. There is also a large part it dedicated to convincing us that this is the best video ever put together. If this were weeded out of all the useless time I would give it 2-3 stars.,1203292800,2,322,4.47457627118644
8118083,5,B000F6YVQS,"I am a 54 year old guy who races a bit, freestyle nordic (so I haven't reviewed all the other aspects of the DVD).  I found the explanations and video demonstrations of various techniques in nordic freestyle to be compelling and inspirational, especially to visualize them before a race.  Short of a lesson, this is about as good as it gets.

8118084,5,B000F6YVQS,"There are only a handful of truly remarkable and pragmatic works in the field of Sports Science, instruction and coaching - this is one. The technical content is impeccable, clear and compelling. As the title suggests, this DVD constitutes the most complete and authoritative source of information on nordic skiing technique.",1146614400,5,325,5.392156862745098
8118085,5,B000F6YVQS,"I checked this out from the library, and was blown away, particularly when I compared it to the other videos I've seen - now I'm buying it! Nothing has improved my skiing technique more than watching this DVD once. I think this is the most important skiing resource that I've come across. After watching a chapter of this DVD, I am far more effective on snow. I even downloaded the .mp3 narration onto my ipod and it was like having my own personal Olympic coach with me - beautiful.",1145836800,12,483,4.438202247191011
8118086,5,B000F6YVQS,"This has got to be the best instructional skiing DVD or video that I have yet seen... and I have a shelf full of material.  I can tell you, this DVD will gather no dust.  It is now my definitive reference for the sport. It's exceptionally well organized. I have compared xczone.tv methods against other instructional videos and found theirs superior in every respect: quality of production, performance of skiers, clarity and correctness of description.",1144627200,5,453,5.026666666666666
8118087,5,B000F6YVQS,"An all-star team has created one of the most engaging, instructional resources ever published for Nordic skiers. This carefully animated guide to skiing knowledge empowers the skier master the subtleties of technique: classic, ski skating, norpine, telemark, and more advanced moves. The knowledge in this DVD is readily absorbable. Some people sell DVDs but can't demonstrate nor teach. In my opinion, these folks are master instructors and certainly elite skiers. This DVD is extraordinary- simply in a class of its own in the quality and quantity of skiing knowledge on the disk. The DVD is essential to every cross-country skier. The combined expertise of the country's top Nordic skiers, coaches and instructors is impressive, and their message poignant.",1144108800,7,759,5.440677966101695
