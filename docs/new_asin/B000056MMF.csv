1398567,5,B000056MMF,i love this dvd. babyface had a couple of songs that i liked on here that i didn't even know where his. get this dvd you will not be disappointed!,1280707200,,146,3.9
1398568,4,B000056MMF,"Babyface has some very nice songs, and am a fan, especially of his TENDER LOVER Album. All the songs are amazing, especially ""Whip Appeal"" and ""Where will you go"", which happen to be my favourites. Now, when it comes to this DVD, the version of ""Whip Appeal"", did not impress me at all. Yet, it was one of the reasons why I purchased this DVD. All the other songs, I have no problem with. One that is missing, and I would have loved to see is ""Where will you go"". A beautiful song like that should have a video. Otherwise it was nice to see songs like ""Rock Bottom and ""For the Cool in You"". As for ""This is for the Lover in You"" with Shalamar, I really don't care about, as I most definitely prefer the original version anytime, forever. Get it if you are a BabyFace Fan. Other than that, 4 stars is all I can give for this DVD!",1235174400,,829,4.1234567901234565

1398570,4,B000056MMF,I've always dug Babyface. the Brother had the Smooth Slow Jams and he grew as a Solo Artist after writing and Producing for others and a whose who of Acts in the Industry. His videos were cool as well. Face always kept things on the smooth tip and he never sounded trendy as he was his own trend. a Good Solid collection here. Face has left a lasting mark.,1178409600,,356,4.173913043478261

1398573,4,B000056MMF,"First and foremost I would like to say I have been a babyface fan for quite some time so I expected a lot from this DVD.  This DVD focuses on Babyface the Artist.  The presentation is great, the menus are subtle and smooth (no annoying wait while an animation plays).  The chapter screens play music selections which make you want to stay there a little longer.  I really wish this DVD contained Babyfaces entire collection of Music videos but instead it has a selected few which was more than enough.  I wished the Videos were in chronological order so you could see babyface's progression as an artist.  Video quality was a little above average and the sound is great it even has a dolby 5.1 option.
Overall, whether you're a die hard babyface fan or if you haven't bought any of his albums you will still find this DVD a worthwhile addition to your collection.  I love it and will play it over and over.
Pros - Menu's, Sound, and overall polished feeling Cons - Could have added more videos or an interview",982886400,17,1009,4.48087431693989
