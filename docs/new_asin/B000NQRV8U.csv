2779122,5,B000NQRV8U,"Hate to sound like a demented fan - but I can't wait! This is the season that features the cross-over episodes of Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet Dracula/ Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet the Hollywood Phantom. Plus I hope this has the ""rare"" Christmas ep of Nancy Drew - Will the Real Santa Claus... As mentioned, the major disappointment comes with Pamela Sue Martin's departure. In an interview she said she didn't want to turn into the girl that said - you boys solve the mystery while I go call the police. And sure enough that's what happened to the new Nancy. If anybody recalls - the first episode of Janet Louise Johnson as Nancy was one of the most idiotic episodes ever. First, her Nancy has been missing for months, kidnapped and held captive by an old geezer. That Nancy couldn't get out of that one herself was so preposterous. Then - to add further insult to injury, the Hardy Boys have to come rescue her and all she does the entire time is whine. Pamela's version of Nancy would've gotten out long before the Hardy Boys got there. Watch the Dracula and Phantom episodes and see how well she holds her own against the boys!",1173312000,53,1136,4.440191387559809

2779155,5,B000NQRV8U,"While I initially was not a fan of Shaun (too much teen idol stuff), it started to end up a bit better, once it was not promoting his singing career.  The sad part is that Pamela Sue Martin did not appear in most of the end episodes, and she had a replacement for three.  As far as I can tell, neither one appeared at all in Season 3.  Would have been a better overall show with both leads getting some equal billing and time on the series...  The stories start to get a lot better towards the end of the season as well.",1477353600,,520,4.019417475728155

2779235,4,B000NQRV8U,"It's the world's greatest teen super-sleuths to the rescue as Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys return in 22 hour-long episodes of THE HARDY BOYS NANCY DREW MYSTERIES-SEASON 2!

Based on the hugely popular books and starring teen idols Shaun Cassidy(Joe Hardy), Parker Stevenson(Frank Hardy) and Pamela Sue Martin(Nancy Drew), these thrilling episodes follow the determined detectives on spooky mysteries in Dracula's Castle, at Mardi Gras in New Orleans and even in the Bermuda Triangle!

Contributing to the fun and excitement are 7 hit songs from David Cassidy's kid brother(Shaun Cassidy) that made him a pop music sensation, including ""That's Rock `N Roll"" and ""Hey Deanie."" Also, along for the chase in this 1977-78 Season are such special guest stars as Casey Kasem, Rick Springfield, Melanie Griffith and Valerie Bertinelli. Follow the clues to fantastic music and adventures with TV's most famous teenage detectives!

THE HARDY BOYS takes me all the way back to memory lane to when my babysitters used to watch it every Sunday night on ABC when I was 5 years old in Kindergarten and when THE HARDY BOYS had been shown in reruns on TV Land briefly back in 1999.

Eventually after ABC had cancelled THE HARDY BOYS, Pamela Sue Martin co-starred as Fallon Carrington Colby on DYNASTY from 1981 to 1985 and Parker Stevenson co-starred on NBC's version of BAYWATCH as LA County lifeguard(Craig Pomroy)from the Fall of 1989 thru the Spring of 1990 until it was cancelled, due to weak ratings.",1389830400,,1490,5.020242914979757
2779236,5,B000NQRV8U,"I remember watching these shows in the 70's & now my children are enjoying them today.

Do not expect much similarity to the original books -- especially in later seasons.
Great for family viewing -- no offensive language, sex or serious violence.

Highly recommend  :)",1389657600,,269,4.933333333333334
2779237,5,B000NQRV8U,"excellent series for kids - lots of laughs, and enough mystery to keep it interesting - no sex, no swearing and very little violence",1384646400,,132,4.541666666666667
2779238,4,B000NQRV8U,The Hardy Boys Nancy Drew Mysteries are one of my favorites although the 1970's fashions are a little funky for this day and age.  I now own all three seasons. Sorry to she Nancy Drew was not in Season 3.,1384300800,,204,4.1
2779239,4,B000NQRV8U,"If you're familiar with this series, you know that the Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries are fun family fare from the '70s.  The plotting, especially for the boys' adventures, is pretty goofy but there's nothing here that I'd call high-camp, and the performances are solid with good chemistry between Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy and a great performance by Pamela Sue Martin as a young feminist version of Nancy Drew (although I also liked Tracy Ryan's '90s&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/portrayal/dp/B000RMT9FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">portrayal</a>.)

As in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/first-season/dp/B0007CNY54/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">first season</a>, Joe and Frank Hardy are two enthusiastic but clumsy young wanna-be detectives who solve cases pretty much accidentally in loosely structured plots, capitalizing on the popularity of then-teen heartthrob Cassidy. Nancy gets marginally better material although the plots are still pretty formulaic and tend to involve her getting into trouble, getting the perpetrator to talk, and getting rescued.

In the PREVIOUS season George O'Hanlon, Jr played Ned Nickerson, Nancy's lawyer father's geeky assistant, with Jean Rasey as Nancy's boy-crazy but not thrill-crazy friend George Fayne; it was a fun supporting cast.  In THIS season, Ned is briefly reinvented (a cameo appearance by Rick Springfield,) then disappears. Susan Buckner plays George; she does a good job but is less broad than Rasey and consequently not as entertaining; Ruth Cox briefly plays a quite slim Bess Marvin.  William Schallert returns as Carson Drew, and Ed Gilbert again plays Fenton Hardy.  The big surprise comes in the two-part Voodoo Doll episode, where Martin was replaced in the Nancy role by Janet Louise Johnson, an, um, attractive young actress.

Don't expect information on that kind of thing in this set; there is really nothing in the way of extras here - the ""Bonus Materials"" are actually advertisements for the ""Sleuth"" cable channel (currently called ""Cloo."")  If you are interested, of the 12 old tv shows they were airing, ""Magnum, PI"" was their most popular and ""Columbo"" the number two.  Anyway there are no cast interviews or anything like that from THIS series - my suspicion is that if this had sold well, the company would have gone on to milk the market with a blu-ray set with more features.  As it is, that does not look to be forthcoming anytime soon.  The DVD quality for this set is OK.

There's more location work in this season, but plenty that was all too obviously shot on a sound stage.  Supporting characters (LOTS of fun cameos) do their best, but the stories are typical Glen Larson 'say I have an idea somebody write this down' kind of things.  I get a kick out of it, but be aware television has come a lo-o-ong way since!

The episodes on this 5-disc set are:
  DISC 1 - The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet Dracula (2-part;) The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb; The Mystery of the Hollywood Phantom (part 1)
  DISC 2 - The Mystery of the Hollywood Phantom (part 2;) Mystery of the African Safari; The Creatures Who Came on Sunday; Strange Fate of Flight 608; Acapulco Spies
  DISC 3 - Nancy Drew's Love Match; The Mystery of the Silent Scream; Will the Real Santa Claus...; The Lady on Thursday at Ten; Oh Say Can You Sing
  DISC 4 - The House On Possessed Hill; Sole Survivor; Voodoo Doll (2-part)
  DISC 5 - Mystery on the Avalanche Express; Death Surf; Arson and Old Lace; Campus Terror.",1381536000,,3558,5.254867256637168

When it became available on DVD, I immediately purchased it for my children to enjoy (and for me to re-enjoy!).

The mysteries are a joke, but the hair sytles, fashion, and wholesome language (something not enjoyed in todays TV) is a great time for EVERYONE in the family.

I highly recommend!!!

2779311,4,B000NQRV8U,"Although the show still featured Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, season 2 was already starting to focus more on the Hardy Boys.  When Pamela Sue Martin learned that there would be no more Nancy Drew episodes in the next season, she left the show in the middle of season 2 and another actress took over the role of Nancy Drew.  I agree with a lot of the other reviewers that the show started to go downhill in season 2, when Pamela Sue Martin left.  Personally, I was disappointed that they stopped the Nancy Drew portion of the show.  Some of the episodes might seem a bit corny, however they are still a lot of fun.  Die-hard fans of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys will love these shows.  I know I do!  In this set, the episodes aren't separated into Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys, like the ones in the first season.  The episodes are in the order they were aired.  Here's a list of the episodes:

1. The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet Dracula, pts. 1 and 2 -- The Hardy Boys go to Transylvania to find their missing father and run into Nancy Drew, who was supposed to meet with Mr. Hardy to investigate some art thefts.  These strange circumstances seem to surround a rock concert held at a local castle where Dracula supposedly lived.  Could there still be a vampire lurking in the dark caverns under the castle?

2. The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb -- The Hardy Boys travel to Egypt where they try to help a young woman whose purse was stolen.  Surprisingly, she is less than grateful for their help and refuses to take the purse back.  Frank finds a statuette inside the purse that looks like it's made of gold.  Could the girl have actually wanted it stolen?

3. The Mystery of the Hollywood Phantom, pts. 1 and 2 -- The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew are attending a detectives' convention in Los Angeles.  After a tour of a movie studio, strange things start happening to the convention attendees.  Who is out to get the detectives?

4. Mystery of the African Safari -- The Hardy Boys are asked to help investigate a case of poaching in Africa where the animals' bodies are not even found.

5. The Creatures Who Came on Sunday -- An old friend of the Hardy Boys' asks for their help in finding her missing boyfriend.  She believes that his disappearance has something to do with a UFO that she saw in the mountains nearby.  Although Frank and Joe don't believe in aliens, it's clear that something is going on in the mountains that people don't want anyone to know about.

6. Strange Fate of Fligth 608 -- A stewardess friend of the Hardy Boys gets them seats on a flight carrying a group of stewardess trainees from Nassau to New York.  One of the stewardesses is nervous because their flight will pass through the Bermuda Triangle.  Her worries don't seem as silly when the flight crew is drugged and Frank has to land the plane.

7. Acapulco Spies -- Fenton Hardy is on a case in Acapulco when he runs into some trouble.  He tells Frank and Joe to go to a certain hotel and wait until someone gives them a certain code phrase.  From there, everything goes wrong.  Fenton Hardy disappears, and by accident, a couple of American girls say the code words to boys.

8. Nancy Drew's Love Match -- Nancy Drew is asked by a concerned parent to watch his daughter, a young tennis star with kleptomaniac tendancies, but there may also be a more sinister criminal at work.

9. The Mystery of the Silent Scream -- A deaf girl reads the lips of a man plotting a horrible crime.  She will need the help of the Hardy Boys to catch the man before he can put his plan into action.

10. Will the Real Santa Claus . . . -- In this Nancy Drew Christmas episode, Nancy must prove that a man who may or may not be Santa Claus is innocent of a series of burglaries.  There is also a new Ned Nickerson in this episode who bears no resemblance to the Ned Nickerson in the first season of the show.

11. The Lady on Thursday at Ten -- Nancy is driving late at night in New York when she gets lost and accidentally hits a man with her car.  The man is taken to the hospital, and another man at the scene tells her that he is with the NYPD and the man she hit was an escapee.  When Nancy doesn't hear from him the next day, she makes inquiries with the police, and they say that they've never heard of the policeman or the escapee.

12. Oh Say Can You Sing -- Joe is invited to sing at a concert put on by a friend, Harriet, but Harriet is arrested over a hit-and-run accident.  Harriet claims that she only witnessed the accident and reported it to the police, but the police say that she never came to them.

13. The House on Possessed Hill -- Frank and Joe feel obligated to help a disturbed young woman who seems to have psychic abilities and a strange connection to an old house that people believe is haunted.  Is she a witch, like some people believe, or are her visions hinting at some disturbing events in the past?

14. Sole Survivor -- Joe wakes up in a hospital in Hong Kong and is told that his father and brother are dead.  Did a car accident really kill them, or is there something else happening?

15. Voodoo Doll, pts. 1 and 2 -- The Hardy Boys visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras, but soon after they arrive, someone steals their wallets.  Then, someone leaves voodoo dolls of them in their room.  They don't know why, but it seems to be connected to a magician performing at a night club.  Meanwhile, Nancy Drew is undercover as a magician at the same night club on an investigation of her own.  This is the first episode featuring Janet Louise Johnson as Nancy Drew.

16. Mystery on the Avalanche Express -- The Hardy Boys and Nancy are in Europe to see a ski tournament.  They find themselves on a train with a frightened woman who is being pursued by men demanding that she give them something that belonged to her late brother, only she has no idea what they want.  (This episode bears a strong resemblance to the movie Charade with Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn.)

17. Death Surf -- While on vacation, Frank tries to save a drowning girl, but no one finds any trace of her.  Her father tells Franks that he and his daughter weren't very close, but he wants to know more about her life.  As Frank and Joe start to investigate the dead girl, they find out that they're not the only ones interested in her.

18. Arson and Old Lace -- The Hardy Boys are desperately trying to find Nancy Drew, who has been kidnapped by a man living out obsessive fantasies about his dead wife.  The situation is made all the more dangerous by an arsonist.

19. Campus Terror -- The Hardy Boys try to help an old friend when her college classmates start disappearing.  The identity of the kidnapper will come as a shock to them all.",1278633600,6,6704,4.329591018444266
2779332,5,B000NQRV8U,I was so excited to find this on DVD.I loved the books and I would always watch The Hardy Boys on Sunday night. It makes me remember being 10. The color is a bit washed out but I have found that very common in older TV shows. I find the stories much funnier than I did when I was little but well worth the price. My kids think the show is hysterical.,1274140800,,350,3.875

2779334,3,B000NQRV8U,"In the first season, The Hardy Boys Mysteries and Nancy Drew Mysteries split time equally, alternating episodes each week.  In second season, the series underwent a major change, placing the emphasis on the Hardy Boys, and making Nancy Drew secondary.  Of the 22 episodes, only three were stand alone Nancy Drew Mysteries.  Pamela Sue Martin also appeared as Nancy Drew, in two, two-part Hardy Boy adventures.  Martin, left the series with several episodes remaining, resulting in Janet Louise Johnson being cast as a replacement.  Johnson, appeared as Nancy Drew, in four additional episodes.

With more backing from the studio, The Hardy Boys Mysteries changed in several ways.  The writing, while still not great, is improved.  Many of the clichs remained, but the series featured colorful international settings outside of Bayport, Massachusetts, that created possibilities for the stories.  Hollywood, Las Vegas, New Orleans, Hawaii, Hong Kong, Austria, Nassau, Egypt, and Africa, are some of the scenic spots on the Hardy boys' itinerary .  The handsome brothers, Joe (Shaun Cassidy) and Frank (Parker Stevenson), while still prone to goofy foulups, display a higher level of maturity and competence.  Still mostly pretty boy detectives, who usually run from trouble, at least the Hardy boys are now independent, and not constantly apologizing like schoolboys in the principal's office after messing up.  While more lovers than fighters, the Hardy's are able to take on some physical tasks, without looking completely ridiculous.

With most of the action set outside of Bayport, first season regulars Aunt Gertrude (Edith Alwater),  and Callie (Lisa Eilbacher) were written out of season two.  On their own, the guys, especially Frank, experienced a hormone rush, becoming much, much, more interested in girls, with this often being the motivation for their investigations.  Some of the young actresses featured include, Kimberly Beck, Valerie Bertinelli (One Day at a Time), Kim Cattrall (Sex In the City), Debra Clinger, Elyssa Daniels, Bonnie Ebsen, Martha Garrett, Melanie Griffith (Working Girl), Jean Marie Hon, Maren Jensen (Battlestar Gallactica), Stepfanie Kramer (Hunter), Anne Lockhart (Battlestar Gallactica), Robin Mattson, Cathy Rigby, and Deborah Ryan.  After some pretty lackluster guest stars in season one, season two featured notable Hollywood veterans like J. D. Cannon,  Cesare Danova, Thayer David, Howard Duff, Lorne Greene, James Hong, Jack Jones, Casey Kasem, Dorthy Malone, Ray Milland, Diana Muldaur, Larry Storch, James Wainright, Paul Williams, and Stuart Whitman.  Those making cameos include Jaclyn Smith, Robert Wagner, and Dennis Weaver.

The Hardy boys remain mostly non-violent, and inept at fighting.  A push is usually about as aggressive as they get, and it often doesn't take more than a push to put a Hardy down, particularly Joe.  Whenever they are travelling, these guys seem to get their room searched nearly every time, but thankfully Joe doesn't spend much time, ridiculously collecting fingerprints anymore.  The Hardy's have mostly left their junior investigators ways behind, taking on enemy spies, braving fires, thwarting smugglers, facing ghosts, and even managing to land a jet airliner at sea!  Although the guys are approaching superspy status, there are still many cartoonish 'Scooby Doo' aspects (laughing phantoms, ghosts, witches, and vampires) to the program, which are part of its 'charm'.

While Shaun Cassidy's singing is featured more, he also demonstrates that he has some talent as an actor, with his best dramatic performance probably being in Sole Survivor, where foreign agents try to trick Joe into believing that he has been in a coma, and that Frank and his father are dead.  The younger Hardy uses his head and makes a daring escape across the rooftops of Hong Kong, with a beautiful nurse.  Campus Terror features a very determined Joe, searching for whoever is terrorizing female students on campus.  The guys usually have an exciting time in Hawaii.  In Death Surf, Frank is obsessed with finding out all he can about a girl that disappeared in the surf.  Mystery on the Avalanche Express, is like a reunion for past teen stars, featuring Troy Donahue, Tommy Sands, Fabian, and Deborah Walley.  It's a pretty good adventure set on a train passing through Europe, that features Joe fighting on the rooftop of the train, and in a ski chase down a slope.

While things are going very well for the Hardy Boys, the same can't be said for Nancy Drew.  Nancy repeatedly describes herself as a 'part time investigator', and ironically, that is exactly what she became in season two.  The rise of the Hardy brothers' star, is correspondingly the setting sun for Pamela Sue Martin.  Martin has three separate Drew adventures, but most of her River Heights ground base from season one is gone.  William Schallert returns as Carson Drew, but Susan Buckner replaces Jean Rasey as Nancy's pal George Fayne, and Rick Springfield is the reintroduced Ned Nickerson.  Martin's stand alone episodes are not very well written.  The best may be Nancy Drew's Love Match, where Nancy is hired to keep an eye on a star tennis player (Maureen McCormick, Brady Bunch) who has a penchant for shoplifting.

Martin fit in well, when teamed with the Hardy Boys, with the writers playing up her relationship with Frank, but with her role reduced, she decided to move on.  Her replacement, nineteen year old Janet Louise Johnson, does an admirable job, in what must have been a stressful situation.  It is kind of hard to accept another actress as Nancy Drew, after the sudden switch, but there isn't much choice.  Johnson makes her entrance in the two-part episode Voodoo Doll, and does her best with the part.  She is put to the test in Arson and Old Lace, a completely over the top story, where Nancy has been kidnapped, and held captive for six months, by a demented, reclusive millionaire.  Later she is put into the ridiculous position of shinnying up an elevator cable with Frank.

The Hardy Boys becoming jet setting international operatives, unfortunately left Nancy Drew behind.  In the third and final season, Nancy Drew would be completely phased out.  In season two, Frank and Joe become more well rounded and credible sleuths, while retaining their wholesome appeal.  After leaving the series, Pamela Sue Martin apparently sought to radically change her image, appearing in Playboy in 1978, and playing a prostitute in The Lady in Red (1979).  She then secured the role as Fallon, on Aaron Spelling's Dynasty (1981-84).",1262476800,14,6582,5.1992409867172675
2779335,5,B000NQRV8U,"This series takes me back to a time when I was young and innocent.  I remember watching the show on Sunday nights every week and I really enjoyed them.  It was a well made show and very entertaining.  I am very pleased that now, more than 30 years later, that it still entertains me.",1262304000,,283,4.203703703703703
2779336,5,B000NQRV8U,"Season two contains a number of solid episodes but it's the two cross-over episodes entitled The Hardy Boys & Nancy Drew Meet Dracula / The Mystery of The Hollywood Phantom that really stand out in this season for me. Season two is also bitter sweet for fans of the show because it marks the end of Pamela Sue Martin as Nancy Drew because Janet Louise Johnson replaces her as Nancy midway through the second season. Once the change in Nancy's character takes place it becomes evident that this show will never be the same and the end for Nancy Drew isn't far behind.

Season two is a mixed bag when it comes to the quality of plots the actors were given to work with but if its nostalgia you're after then season two is definitely for you. The 70's were the best when it came to family entertainment and I can't think of any show on television today that families can sit and watch together. The 22 episodes included in this set are filled with mystery, suspense, adventure and pure fun for the whole family even if they're a little dated.

The quality of the picture and sound in season two is really decent and I'm glad I've added this DVD set to my collection. I don't remember seeing or hearing this show look or sound as good as it does on DVD. Finally Universal Studios has done something right and presented season two on 5 single sided discs with nice artwork and detail. The disc packaging and artwork are well done and Universal Studios should be commended for their efforts.

If you're looking for more mystery and suspense then season two of ""The Hardy Boys / Nancy Drew Mysteries"" may be for you! Season two of this classic 70's television series finds the three unlikely sleuths in fine form and up to the challenges that await them. Shaun Cassidy, Parker Stevenson and Pamela Sue Martin have returned for 22 more mysterious and thrilling adventures in season two and fans of this show won't be disappointed. All we need now is the final season to complete the series.

2779337,4,B000NQRV8U,"The makers of this DVD is a quality production, well made.  No special features or interviews of the stars later, regarding the show.  The second season is not as good as the first, but if you (or your young teenager) desires more Nancy Drew or Hardy Boys, it is good.  The first season was great, good plots, and Nancy Drew was and independent, strong charactor with a good & funny supporting friends.  The second season sees the Nancy Drew show fall apart.  The lead (Pamela Sue Martin) leaves the show, her friends are replaced by other actors, who are all ""blond haired, blue eyed, typical 1970's teens who cannot act.""  The original support cast of Nancy Drew's friends, although were geeks, had much more charactor.

  The Hardy Boys shows of the second season are still very good and interesting, although several of the shows have mystery plots that do not really make sense or are just hard to follow or figure out. You can see they are trying to boost ratings by shooting in exotic places, but they don't seem to focus in on the most important aspect-the plot.  Still, a good, clean, show for kids, you will chuckle at the ""1970's"" clothing, very disco and very tight, and such.",1235260800,2,1188,4.614285714285714

Nancy continues to be pushy and unpleasant; but even that is better than what happens when Janet Louise Johnson takes over the role and turns Nancy into a useless, helpless cipher.

2779378,5,B000NQRV8U,"The second season dvd set of THE HARDY BOYS/NANCY DREW MYSTERIES started off with a bang! ""The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet Dracula 1 & 2"" began season two with Parker Stevenson, Shaun Cassidy, and Pamela Sue Martin joining forces to solve a mystery in Dracula's castle. The trio also got together in Hollywood for another two-parter during this season called ""The Mystery Of The Hollywood Phantom."" Again, the story lines are exciting with plot twists and fun filled adventures, but something becomes noticeably different in season two.

It seems that Nancy Drew (Pamela Sue Martin) was being relegated to a supporting character to the Hardy Boys. The shows were now focusing more on Frank and Joe Hardy, and Nancy Drew would be a guest star. Even the number of Nancy Drew episodes dropped from an equal number in the first season (7-to-7), to only three shows(not guest starring with Hardy Boys) in this season.

Maybe the reason for this change was because of Shaun Cassidy's (Joe Hardy) huge popularity as a pop singer during that time, but something made the show's creators focus on the Hardy Boys. Even the regular characters on ""Nancy Drew,"" namely ""George"" and ""Ned,"" were replaced with other actors in season two. I'm not sure if the ""Ned"" character played by Rick Springfield in the episode ""Will The Real Santa Claus..."" was supposed to be the ""Ned"" character from season one, but the ""George"" character was definitely the same, but played by a different actress.

Anyway, the changes aren't too jarring until you get half way through the season when Pamela Sue Martin steps out as Nancy Drew and is replaced by Janet Louise Johnson(?) in another Nancy Drew guest-star/two-parter called ""Voodoo Doll."" And even though Johnson(?) isn't bad as ND, Martin was perfect. I don't know why this happened, but whatever the reason it was a little unsettling. It would be like Lynda Carter being replaced as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman half-way through the season of ""Wonder Woman.""

Although I didn't like this change in casting, I gave this set 5-stars because the shows were pretty good...even if they were mostly ""Hardy Boys"" episodes. The episode called ""Arson and Old Lace,"" the second to the last on this season, was a little corny where Nancy Drew gets kidnapped by this old man and held for six months. There's this scene where Frank and Nancy are climbing up an elevator shaft; they reach the top of it and all of a sudden they're outside on the roof. So suspension of disbelief was really being stretched there.

But I'm glad I bought this set. The picture and sound quality are good and this time the episodes are on five single-sided dvds. There's also a bonus feature called ""America's Top Sleuths"" that says it's the Sleuth Channel's countdown of top sleuths on tv and film. Another thing I enjoyed on this set, that was also on season one, was the voice over at the beginning of each show saying, ""Tonight on the Hardy boys/Nancy Drew..."" and the episode title.",1183161600,6,2979,4.810546875
2779379,5,B000NQRV8U,"While I have NOT seen the entire season as of yet, I did watch 5 episodes and they are GREAT! Crystal Clear picture and sound.

I was a bit upset that they decided to Include Pamela Sue Martin in with The Hardy Boys episodes because it would mean that there won't be any more Nancy Drew episodes on her own and I LOVE Nancy Drew. What is also scaring me now is that the girl who replaced her made the character look STUPID. Or should I say the writers.

The Character of Nancy Drew IS  detective and she shouldn't be made into a dimwit. I love Pamela Martin's portrayal of the Young, sexy and SMART detective because she really DID show the Boys (The Handsome Parker Stevenson and Shaun Cassidy)what she could do and didn't need a man to come to her rescue. So it will be hard for me to get used to the New Nancy.

I also can NOT wait for season 2 of Dynasty as I have already have season1 which also starred the great Pamela Sue Martin as Fallon Carrington the conniving and seductive daughter of Blake Carrinton played convincingly by John Forsythe who voiced the Charlie Townsend character on the Cahrlie's Angels the most popular tv series of ALL time.

All I need now would be the Bionic Woman seasons 1-3 and Police Woman season 2 and One Day at a Time season 2 and I will be very happy.

I also have Cagney & Lacey on dvd.",1183161600,4,1329,4.233201581027668
2779380,5,B000NQRV8U,It is amazing that NICK at NITE hasn't brought back these great show's from the 70's.  Alot of great actors at the beginning of there career's and wow YOUNG!!!!,1182902400,,160,4.517241379310345
2779381,5,B000NQRV8U,"There are many DVD sets in my collection and not one of them was as anticipated as this one.  I'm pleased to say that Season Two of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries does not disappoint.

To put Season Two in perspective I must first say a few words about Season One.  Released on DVD in March 2005, the first season episodes beautifully capture the essence of The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew novels that have been a staple in children's literature since the 1920's.  Frank, Joe, and Nancy helped solve mysteries around their hometowns, often assisting their fathers on important cases.  In Season One the guys and Nancy are just getting started with their crime solving, sometimes making mistakes here and there.  This could be debated but Nancy made far fewer mistakes than the boys ever did! In both seasons Nancy is a young woman who mostly works alone and gets the job done right the first time.  Pamela Sue Martin's portrayal of Nancy was perfect.  No one else could ever BE Nancy, then or now.

Nearing the end of Season One a phenomenon helped to transform this great children's series into ""must-see-TV"" for teens and pre-teens everywhere:  The Brothers Hardy - wonderfully portrayed by Parker Stevenson and super singer Shaun Cassidy - became teen idols. And so began Season Two...

Though it has been done in print many times since, the first episode on this Season Two set has the characters of Frank, Joe, and Nancy meeting for the first time ever.  The brothers are hardly ever home this season, though they do still assist their dad on occasion.  The second season takes the guys to exotic lands and the danger quotient is slightly increased over the previous year.  If you're a fan of The Hardy Boys Casefiles (novels written in the late '80's) this season is for you!

Many guest stars lend their talents to this season too, including Lorne Green, Valerie Bertinelli, Edd Byrnes (77 Sunset Strip), Troy Donahue, Fabian, Tommy Sands, Deborah Walley (Gidget), Melanie Griffith, Ray Milland (veteran actor from the 1920's through the 1980's), Linda Dano (One Life to Live), Rick Springfield (General Hospital), Jaclyn Smith (Charlie's Angels), Robert Wagner (Hart to Hart), Casey Kasem (radio personality), Dennis Weaver (McCloud), and many more.

I'm proud to say I've been a fan of this series for 30 years, though I didn't watch it regularly until the end of season two.  My memories of watching ""The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries"" take me back to edited reruns on snowy, low-powered UHF TV channels during the television days B.C. (Before Cable). Needless to say, this set is a joy to watch; the episodes are complete and beautifully restored. They are presented on five neatly packaged single-sided discs. New generations will watch this and get acquainted with three super sleuths who value friendship, perseverance, independence, respect, hard work, brotherly love, and so much more that's missing from today's television landscape.  Three decades have passed but parents and children can still enjoy this show together.  That is the sign of a true classic.

Finally, I must salute the cast - Shaun, Parker, Pamela, Janet Louise Johnson as Nancy Drew, Edmund Gilbert (the ONLY Fenton Hardy and the perfect Hardy dad!), and William Schallert as Mr. Drew.  Without you this series would not be the classic that it is. The evidence - this DVD set - proves it!",1182729600,19,3375,4.938053097345133
2779392,5,B000NQRV8U,"I enjoyed these episodes very much.  Some were more enjoyable than others.  It sure beats today's TV shows!  We need more fun, mystery shows like the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew from yesteryear!

The whole family will enjoy these dvd's.  My sons (20 & 21), and my husband, have watched a few episodes.  And my granddaughter (9), loves to watch them with me.

It's fun for those of us who are middle-aged and young-at-heart, to see the style of hair, clothing & music from these late 70's episodes, that we enjoyed as teens.

Yes, Pamela Sue Martin left about half-way through this season, however, the replacement actress did a good job and added a fresh interest to her Nancy Drew character.

Although, I did not like the script for ""Arson and Old Lace"" leaving Nancy desperately waiting to be rescued. There are interesting firefighting scenes in this episode.

I highly recommend these dvd's!  And I highly recommend season one, as well!",1182384000,2,938,4.763975155279503
2779393,5,B000NQRV8U,"When my family first bought the first season of Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys, I thought they were going to be the most hokiest shows ever.  After a while, they grew on me.  The characters are so much fun to watch and the wit they use is quite hysterical.  It's great to watch with the family; everyone gets quite involved.  We were all very thrilled when the second season came out.  We had it pre-ordered and have not stopped watching them since.  Even my friends come over to watch them, which is saying something.  I highly recommend this series, and I hope that there are more seasons to come!",1182297600,2,598,4.381818181818182

2779395,5,B000NQRV8U,I missed many of the episodes in 1977 as VCR's were not invented yet--so very glad to have Season 2! Can't wait for Season 3. Avid fan of ND books as a baby boomer. Fun seeing actors now in their 50's as kids.,1181779200,3,209,3.883720930232558
2779396,5,B000NQRV8U,"I am so happy the studios are releasing all this classic late '70's early '80's tv on DVD. I recently bought Buck Rogers so this will be a nice addition to the collection. And the HB/ND was such a great pairing that I am surprised that the CW never capitalized on creating a Mystery Night with Veronica Mars/Supernatural. It's practically the same thing right down to Keith being a modern day Carson.

2779397,5,B000NQRV8U,"...devoted fans of this classic of the late 1970s can stop rewinding and rewatching their tired old VHS tape copies of reruns from Saturday at noon.  Arguably, the second season was the best of this series, at least as long as Pamela Sue Martin was around...though the loss of Lisa Eilbacher as Callie Shaw is lamentable.  This was the peak of the show's popularity as a Sunday night 7:00 p.m. EST staple; both the Christmas episode and the two-part ""Voodoo Doll"" are memorably nostalgic.  All in all a great tribute to the fans who successfully petitioned (and bought the first season): it was by no means a guarantee that this season would ever be released on DVD.

2779400,4,B000NQRV8U,"I'm VERY excited that we're finally going to see another season make it to DVD. However, I do have a minor complaint:

Season TWO consists of ""22 episodes"" and three are ""two-part"" episodes (making the real ""whole episode"" count ""19""). Here is a list of the ""season two"" episodes:

The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet Dracula (Part 1) - 09/11/77
The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew Meet Dracula (Part 2) - 09/18/77
The Mystery of King Tut's Tomb 09/25/77

The Mystery of the African Safari - 10/16/77
The Creatures Who Came From Sunday - 10/30/77
The Strange Fate of Flight 608 - 11/06/77
Acapulco Spies - 11/13/77
Nancy Drew's Love Match - 01/20/77
The Silent Scream - 11/27/77
Will the Real Santa Claus..? - 12/18/77
The Lady on Thursday at Ten - 01/01/78
Oh Say Can You Sing - 01/08/78
The House on Possessed Hill - 02/22/78
Sole Survivor - 01/29/78
Voodoo Doll (Part 1) - 02/12/78
Voodoo Doll (Part 2) - 02/19/78
Mystery Of The Avalanche Express - 12/26/78
Death Surf - 03/12/78
Arson and Old Lace - 03/31/78
The Campus Terror - 05/06/78

""Season Three"" consists of only ""10 episodes"" and two are ""two parts"" (which basically makes it an ""8 episode"" season). I think that it would have made more sense to release a ""season two AND season three"" combo box set. I realize that it would have added to the cost, but then we may end up having to wait a couple more years for the final ""10"" (""8"") episodes. Let's hope not!!

This series is standard ""Glen Larson"" material and GREAT nostalgia entertainment! The chemistry of the cast helps to drive the series and make it a light hearted, fun, and quite enjoyable viewing experience!
