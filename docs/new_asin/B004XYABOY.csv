8447616,4,B004XYABOY,"This series reviews the top weaponry in current use among modern armies, especially those of the US, Britain, France, & Germany, but some other nations too.  It was one of the most informative documentaries I have ever seen.  It has occasional bits of history, but is almost exclusively on the weapons currently employed.",1358640000,4,321,5.037735849056604
8447617,5,B004XYABOY,"I have watched many shows on military channel. Some have been good, like ""top 10"". Others felt more like they were designed for 14 year old kids ie. ""Future Weapons"". This show is my favorite one and the only one which accurately describes all of the intricacies of the modern military.

Firepower focuses less on ""cool"" effects and more on the strategies and tactics involved in using these platforms and weapons in a modern war. One episode called ""Armor Force"" describes in detail the differences between heavy and light divisions, how each component of a division (armor, mechanized infantry, artillery, etc.) would be used on a modern battlefield; in what situations would a heavy division be used vs a light division, when tanks would take on the fighting, when infantry would move forward, why the close cooperation between infantry and tanks is so vital.

All of the attention to detail and strategy that this series has makes it one of the best shows on the military channel, even though the actual episodes themselves are dated (pre 9/11).",1331683200,9,1049,4.9209039548022595
