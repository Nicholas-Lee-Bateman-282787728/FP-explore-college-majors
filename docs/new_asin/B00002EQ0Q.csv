7915738,5,B00002EQ0Q,"This is one of my favorite DVDs because it contains an episode with one of my favorite characters, Faye Valentine. In 'Honky Tonk Woman,' she makes a busty entrance as a woman in high debt. The key out of her debt is getting a microchip disguised as a Vegas poker chip. Low and behold, Spike and Jet go to the casino where Faye is. Why? Jet had a dream with Charlie Chaplin that advised him to go there. Spikes makes his encounter with Faye and chases and awesome scenes ensue.
In 'Gateway Shuffle' environmental radicalists threaten Ganymede and so comes Spike, Jet, and Faye to the rescue. This episode is ho hum compared to the other one, but that doesn't slow it down. Stick around near the ending to see the dazzling conclusion. It only gets better.",1008460800,,754,4.510948905109489
7915739,5,B00002EQ0Q,"What can I say that all the other reviewers haven't? This is one of the best Anime series around, full of eye-popping visuals and fantastic action sequences. This particular tape is one of the best in the whole Beebop series.",986515200,,225,4.65
7915740,4,B00002EQ0Q,"The second tape in Cowboy Bebop's series is a little more focused than the first, which is both a good and bad thing I suppose. In ""Honky Tonk  Woman,"" we're introduced to faye, the oh so sexy Lady Luck, who gives  Spike, Jet, and pretty much everyone else in the episode a total headache.  A case of mistaken identity draws Spike into Faye's desperate attempt to  get out of gambling debt? All she has to do is get one chip, she's told,  and he rdebts disappear. As usual in ""Bebop,"" however. .  .nothing's that easy.  The second episode, ""Gateway Shuffle,"" is  a crackerjack action piece. A group called the Space Warriors has a plan to  make perhaps the ultimate environmental statement . . .curing the bug in  the system known as man. Faye, Spike and Jet are once again drawn together  to thwart it. . .for money, of course.  The show is by the numbers, but the  quality is stand-out--the final fight in space (I won't spoil *why*) is  fantastically paced an animated, and indicative of the quality that  permetates every part of this show.  And if the teaser for ""Ballad of  Fallen Angels"" doesn;t make you want to run out and buy Tape #3, then  you're just not paying attention.",967593600,2,1184,4.530805687203792
7915741,5,B00002EQ0Q,"This volume focuses on the introduction of one of the major cast, Faye Valentine. Featuring the voice talent of Megumi Hayashibara, those of you in the anime world would be familiar with this name. So far, no Hayashibara  anime flick has disappoint me, so there, another reason to get this great  series. Some people would be glad to know that Hayashibara does not use a  cutesy ala Slayer voice in this series, she sounded more mature and  probably that is what she would have sound, if she has a real voice that is  :). I have said that this volume introduce a main cast, so you should not  miss it if you are following the series.",945129600,,633,4.413793103448276
