What has happened to this magical movie?",1494115200,,294,5.125
8640888,4,B00ICWONE2,"I had just started junior high school and just starting to get my girly parts that turned me from my big brother's tomboy kid sis...into someone who could finally leave her wallflower-itis behind. My first big girl party, my first set of pumps, when a heel of 1&1/2 inches felt as though they were 10 feet high. And there on NBC's, SATURDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES, (a movie night my girlfriends and I would NEVER MISS)!!  This week they were  running an old love story about a young couple who met and fell in love while attending the same college. Even at 14 years old, most of us who actually became career women...still had enough of our mothers' training to feel a pang of meeting THE ONE in college!  But I digress...The only family the young man had, were an Aunt and Uncle living, I think, in Italy. Whereupon meeting there nephew's intended, the girl fell in love with the Uncle at first sight. The miracle was that he fell for this girl as well! The rest of the storytelling would raise SPOILER ALERTS EVERYWHERE. Suffice it to say I finally understood many ""adult"" double meanings, I had been very unclear about only the day before. For me, it was most certainly a COMING OF AGE film I cherish to this day. Top it off with the title song being sung by JOHNNY MATHIS and A Certain (knowing) Smile is tugging at the corners of my mouth this very moment.  I TRUELY HOPE SOMEONE CAN FIND A COPY OF FILM for me to purchase. No matter how old or cornball to some, I think it would still be of interest to a few BabyBoomers, like myself. Even with no 3D nor digital enhancements.",1480723200,,1579,4.378839590443686
8640889,1,B00ICWONE2,"I don't mean that I don't like the movie per se, but the quality is TERRIBLE.  I have ordered 2 DVDs and received credit for one.  The second on was just as bad.  I don't know where you taped this from, but it is AWFUL.  You really shouldn't be selling this.  I saw the movie when it was shown in the theater and had so looked forward to seeing it again.  NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!",1429056000,6,376,4.082191780821918
