8130014,3,B000GAKQGW,"For those old enough to remember, no matter which side of the issue you were on during America's Vietnam decade, the Hawks and Doves all had legitimate points to make about the conduct of this war and our country's presence in Indochina. John Wayne and an impressive group of authorities make a strong pro-war case in NO SUBSTITUTE FOR VICTORY (1970) that's based on the series of 20th Century events which culminated in the sending of U.S. personnel to Vietnam, first as advisors and then an active military force. They also present evidence that our government was unwilling to commit to total victory.

The all-important (and controversial) Tonkin Gulf incident that provided LBJ a basis for dispatching troops to South Vietnam is mentioned but not explored in depth. Regardless, years of guerilla attacks in the south perpetrated by Ho Chi Mihn's forces upon villagers, police and individual members of local governments needed to be addressed. The debate will always be whether Americans had to take up this burden. If you accept the premise in JFK's 1961 inaugural ""...that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe..."" then the answer is yes.

Things get heavy when Duke berates anti-war protesters who ""burn the American flag, stamp it into the ground while waving the flag of the Viet Cong..."" He labels them ""members of the enemy's forces."" In hindsight, such inflammatory language may have caused the concerned youth this film was in part addressing to tune out its entire message.

This mostly temperate and well presented 73 minute argument for a vigorous prosecution of the war is outstanding in its use of now rare film clips, plus the comments and reminiscences of newsman Lowell Thomas, Gen. Mark Clark, Gen. Albert Weidermeyer, Gen. Paul Harkins, Sgt. Barry Sadler, Adm. U.S. Grant Sharp, Wayne himself and others. Sharp's strategic analysis of a military hamstrung by government policy rings true, yet with both Red China and the USSR interested in the struggle's outcome, was victory in Vietnam ever really possible? We'll of course never know.

Recommended for all interested in American mid-20th Century political and/or military history.",1279670400,,2213,5.121883656509695
8130015,5,B000GAKQGW,"This is worth watching to see the anti-communist perspective of the Vietnam war. Odd how all the liberals want to see the US involvement in Vietnam from the communist point of view. The South Vietnamese had every bit as much right to wish to live free of communism as anyone. The North had the Soviet Union and China backing their war effort, why was it so bad that the US helped the South? The outcome would have been far different had the military not been restricted in it's efforts and the media had been pro-US involvement instead of giving the communists a propaganda outlet. Ignore the whines of the left-wing, the US were the ""Good Guys"" in that fight.",1209859200,,660,4.554621848739496
8130016,5,B000GAKQGW,"This is a right-wing propaganda film in favor of the Vietnam War made in 1970.  It is hosted by John Wayne, the most famous draft-dodger of WWII.  It propagates the conservative myths about Vietnam that are still used for political purposes today.

Those myths include: ""We"" weren't losing the war.  Treacherous liberal politicians, the press, and anti-war demonstrators were stopping us from winning.  Other unnamed, conspiratorial ""powers that be"" in Washington were plotting our loss of Vietnam

A stand-out moment in the film is when Wayne wishes aloud that that those ""liberal senators"" who were against the war could be dropped into combat zones.  Wayne, of course, does not volunteer to be dropped into those zones himself, any more than he volunteered for service during WWII.

Don't miss this flick.  As Wayne predicts, having lost Vietnam we now all live under communism.  Oops! Check that; communism evaporated in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall, didn't it.

One of the eerier moments in the film is when one of the ""experts"" tells us that it is better to fight them ""over there"" than on our own shores.  The Vietnamese were going to follow us home also. Shades of Iraq.

We will never know why Wayne throws a fork in disgust on his desk at one point during the film.  It is a cinematic conundrum that he has taken to the grave.

We do know, however, that this would be an amusing piece of historical silliness if we hadn't lost over 50,000 men and women and suffered countless casualties. It was in part due to people like John Wayne, demanding more of the blood and sacrifice that he was unwilling to give during WWII, that the U.S stayed for five more years after this film was made and suffered thousands of needless additional casualties and deaths.

It is worth a watch to witness this exercise in the cultural ignorance of a foreign country displayed by Wayne and all of his military experts.  It is same sort of ignorance that had us invade Iraq. At the time of invasion our president was totally ignorant of the differece between a Shiite and a Sunni.",1205020800,,2077,4.693370165745856
