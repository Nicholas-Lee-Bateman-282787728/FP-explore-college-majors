7901704,5,9606852032,"What an amazing, what a wonderful movie! The language is English (not Greek, as commented above). During the movie, there are occasional scenes where Greek or Spanish are spoken. All you have to do is have the English subtitles on so that you understand those occasional scenes as well. The reviewer who wrote that the movie is in Greek, probably did not start the movie. When the DVD starts, you see only in Greek the words ""start"", ""settings"", ""subtitles"" etc. But it is not difficult to figure out what these words mean (just click on them and see what happens). So, dear Judy, if you still have the DVD, please click on """" to start it, and immediately you will start hearing English. To put subtitles, click on the word """". However, to play the movie you need a DVD player that plays Region 2. Here is my story (in case it can be of any help): soon after the movie came out (and won a number of awards), a friend from Greece told me about it, commenting that this movie should reach every theater worldwide. I ordered it from Greece through ebay, and asked my husband to buy a DVD player that plays Region 2 DVDs. It was not hard for him; he just went on the internet and bought me the DVD player (it is worth having one so that you can see any worthwhile movie you wish to see). The reason I am writing this review now is because only a couple of days ago I saw that amazon has the movie, and last night I saw it for a second time with some friends, and yes it blew me again away. I do wish a Region 1 version is made so that everyone has the opportunity to watch this movie.",1417824000,3,1580,4.2006578947368425

In addition, I would not play on our DVR players.  Oh well.... next time I'll be very sure to check and see that the Dvd is available with English subtitles.",1382918400,2,321,3.8923076923076922
7901706,5,9606852032,"I saw this movie when I was in Greece this past summer and I was blown away. It's a must see. However , when I approached purchasing it, the DVD seems to be a region 1 only, not a region 2. Does anyone know why this isn't selling as a region 1 as well? What a loss to so many viewers, including myself for not being able to have it in my collection.",1316304000,3,349,3.7945205479452055
