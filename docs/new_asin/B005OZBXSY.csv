8482188,2,B005OZBXSY,"I so wanted to like this... but it was basically her saying, ""I'm fat, therefore I'm funny."" She also hates attractive women, and her jealousy wasn't cute, it was just sad. She spoke way too fast, and it reminded me of a manic little kid, begging for love and approval. She came off as sad and miserable, and that can be funny--IF your comedic delivery is up to par. But in this case, it's not. Definitely a thumbs-down.",1525478400,,420,4.397435897435898
