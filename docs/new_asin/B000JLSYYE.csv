2677155,5,B000JLSYYE,"I bought this one for my 3 year old & she already loves it. This is a better way of teaching alphabets to children as there are no distractions through famous cartoon characters. The DVD has amazing animation where a train carries all the alphabets to a farm, lake & a town. It also features how the aphabets get manufactured in a factory. Each alphabet has a different color which my child likes to recognize too. There is background music by Mozart & background vocals repeat each alphabet as it gets displayed on the screen.

Overall, a great learning DVD for toddlers.",1240617600,4,572,4.607843137254902

8151987,5,B000JLSYYE,I found this video at kroger back in 2007. I got it for my 3 year old but my 2 year old  benefitted from it. The video has a Train and showed  all the alphabet.  He enjoyed watching it everyday and leaned his alphabet. I had a new born at the time and I wanted him to see an educational video.  So love this video!!!!!! So got it for my one year old.,1439596800,,350,3.7534246575342465

8151989,1,B000JLSYYE,They just show letters one after one and name the letters and go through the whole alphabet several times. They do not say any other words except the letters. Poor computer graphics. It is very boring!!! It does not hold child's attention. The worst child's educational DVD I ever had.,1384732800,,285,4.72

8151992,5,B000JLSYYE,My son loved this movie when he was 18 months old... by his 2nd birthday he could recognize and say every capital letter of the alphabet. He watched it and played with it so much that it no longer works so I just ordered a new one for my 16 month old daughter.,1308182400,,260,3.9245283018867925
8151993,5,B000JLSYYE,I got this dvd for my 2 year old and he loved it. I had showed him other ABC's videos before and even if he already new his letters he was still fascinated by it. I wish this was the first DVD on ABCs that I had showed him. It is a great learning foundation for learning the alphabet.,1305072000,,284,3.830508474576271

8151995,1,B000JLSYYE,"No catchy songs, very amateur video. The letters just popped up on the screen through the entire video. Just a boring video. Child had no interest in watching at all.",1240790400,,166,4.566666666666666
