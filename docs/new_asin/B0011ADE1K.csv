8241226,4,B0011ADE1K,"In this video, ""Miss Kim"" uses the children's imaginations to get them moving, by pretending that they're part of a variety of scenarios.

We were a little surprised, initially, at how short the video is - only about fifteen minutes.  This short length has definite advantages, though.  Little ones with short attention spans don't get bored with it.  And letting the children use it doesn't put them in front of the television for a lengthy period of time.

The video is divided into eight segments, each one a different scenario.  Some of these may seem silly to adults watching, but the children (more accustomed to using their imaginations!) love them.  They dip their toes into imaginary water, paint with imaginary brushes, and enjoy an imaginary picnic.  They become beautiful ballerinas, and are coated with butter as imaginary popcorn.  These imaginary scenarios, and others like them, get the children pointing and flexing their toes, turning their feet out like ballerinas in first position, skipping, and more, without even realizing it!

My five-year-old enjoyed participating as she watched the video.  My just-turned-one-year-old (who is barely walking) is not playing along yet, but this does capture and hold her attention.  I'm sure she'll be dipping her toes in the water soon!",1217462400,,1296,5.177884615384615

8241228,5,B0011ADE1K,"Our 3 year old daughter routinely asks ""to watch ""Miss Kim Dance.""  She loves to see the other children playing, and imitates their movements and sings along.  She especially enjoys ""Mr. Sun"" and sings it with the arm movements when we're in the car, the grocery store or just spending time together. When ""Mr. Bunny"" starts she says, ""Come on Mommy! Let's get a blanket"" and we act it out together. As a parent it's special to see your child laughing and having fun while participating in meaningful movement  activities.  This is a great source of fun for kids of all ages!

Miss Kim, you are a celebrity at our house!!",1207612800,,621,4.558558558558558
