8677820,5,B00NG39OV4,Excellent dvd for the true/die hard Pentagram fans. This band is so underrated/under appreciated ( except for people like us). I was amazed how good and how good they sounded live back in the 80's.(Even though the sound quality varies on this dvd). Bobby is an awesome frontman and Victor Griffin is probably my favorite guitarist after Tony Iommi(That speaks volumes right there Pentafans!) My favorite on this DVD is the DeathRow show from 83-Wish I was there! If you love Pentagram and any of their CDs buy this and support this Amazing band! That still releasing stuff and God Bless Victor for being Bobbys Guardian Angel! Rock on-and keep Pentagram music coming guys! Peace,1454025600,,678,4.904347826086957
8677821,4,B00NG39OV4,"Out from the sub-basement crypt of American doom legends Pentagram emerges All Your Sins: Video Vault, a collection of bootleg video performances. Released shortly before their new record, the DVD boasts over seven hours of footage from nine shows between 1983 and 2014.

Right off the bat, the package design is solid. The cover features psychedelic purple-hued artwork with a pair of eyes staring right at you. The case opens up, revealing the two discs surrounded by a collage of band photos and artwork from over the years. The back lists all of the shows featured on the release and their setlists.

The first disc contains some of their earlier shows, ranging from 83 to 87 and 96. The second disc contains shows from 93 and 10  14. All of these shows were recorded by an amateur with a home video camera except the last show from 2014, though it unfortunately only has two songs. It is curious that they would leave out most of the footage from a pro-shot, multi-cam show. I suppose they wanted to focus on the bootlegs, as that is what the collection is all about.

The raw, digitized tape compliments Pentagrams crude sound from the 80s. At times, the sound can be a bit too distorted, but I cannot fault them for that entirely, as the band has been underground for over forty years. Content-wise, the sets contain mostly Pentagrams 80s material as well as some 70s classics. It is always a great pleasure to watch Bobby Lieblings antics while performing. The dude is a fiend on stage and knows how to entertain. Guitarist Victor Griffin had some interesting outfits back in the day, in contrast to his understated look nowadays.

Beyond the sound distortion, I do have a few nitpicks. There are a number of factual errors in the information. For example, for the Death Row Silver Fox show, the song Review Your Choices is labeled as Day of Reckoning. Also, that show is from 83, but listed as 85. Pentagram does have a confusing history, however you would think the source would get it right.

Also, as a videographer, I have another nitpick. The aspect ratios (the proportional relationship between an images width and its height) are all over the place. These days, old footage that was shot in 4:3 (the square-ish ratio that most screens used to be) is often converted to 16:9 (the more rectangular format most screens use these days). This is done by either cropping the top and bottom while zooming in the image to fit the rectangle or by stretching the footage to conform to 16:9. Both methods are implemented here from the 80s and 90s footage. I would have preferred they kept it at 4:3 to give the original, full, non-distorted image. Of course as a film major and history minor in college, I would have the two above complaints, but most people would not care.

This DVD release is very substantial, though it is for Penta-fans only. This would probably not be a good introduction for a newcomer, as the songs are at times pretty distorted. It is ideal if you already know the material. It works best if you have an itch to go back in time and experience some real underground heavy metal, in all of its unrefined glory. (MR)

8677822,5,B00NG39OV4,"This official bootleg collection 2 DVD release consisting of audience shot footage from the bands well known recordings (as Death Row) like Silver Fox in Woodbridge,  VA in 1983 shortly before Bobby persuaded Joe, Victor, & Marty to change the bands name to Pentagram, (well circulated by doom traders for decades) as well as The 9:30 club show in DC 1996 including soundcheck minus Bobby, with Victor handling vocals.
the video quality ranges from shaking, to handheld closeups,  to tripod shot, the Audio range is muffled maxed out handheld recorder, to damn good.
the newest show on this DVD is DNA lounge Feb 25th 2014, these newer shows are a pleasant addition to the Victor Griffin Dominated Pentagram,  what's missing??
Any original Pentagram footage from early 70's or the late 70's ""high voltage"" Era Pentagram  (which didn't include Victor Griffin, it does include Marty Swaney & Joe Hasselvander)
being uncertain if such footage exist, who's left to complain.
another M.I.A. lineup is the ""show em how"" band that recorded the lp, it consisted of Internal Void members, also missing any of that footage with Bobby Liebling collapsing,  falling, or seemingly o.d. ing on drugs, this DVD set does its job, Documents the band with Victor Griffin,  who could ask for more!",1430697600,3,1278,5.033175355450237
8677823,3,B00NG39OV4,"I love Pentagram and am thankful for this release. As a fan, I understand that production quality can be poor for some of the band's recordings - we're lucky that they were recorded  at all. This collection is lovingly packaged, and I'd rather have it than not - I knew what to expect. Buyer be aware and preview some YouTube clips if you are unfamiliar with the material - most of this material is officially released audience/fan recorded bootleg quality footage. The band, songs,  and collection are great, but this release takes patience and dedication to get through - some of the footage and sound quality is painfully sub-basement. A fair value for the price tag though.",1428969600,11,677,4.777777777777778
