8756091,1,B01DJQ7HF2,"Do not bother with this movie, audio sucks,picture quality sucks and the acting is WAY below average. Whoever casted this movie should never work in hollywood again because the chicks they casted as the cheerleaders are not cheerleader material. The one good thing about this movie tho is there was decent gore.......but thats about it. DO NOT BUY OR RENT THIS, you been warned",1464307200,2,377,4.90625

8756093,5,B01DJQ7HF2,What a fun movie.  A throwback to all of those horror movies that I have grown up with.,1459987200,,87,3.8333333333333335
8756094,5,B01DJQ7HF2,"A classic throwback to 80s camp slasher films. Cool music. Original practical effects and acting! Finally released on DVD featuring artwork done by artist who did packaging for Sleepaway Camp box set released few years ago. Featuring a good cast of actors and some horror icons from films like Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Overall, a great addition to any fans 80s and Indie movie collection. Artwork alone stands out and will get your friends attention.",1459987200,3,474,5.012658227848101
8756095,4,B01DJQ7HF2,"Great little slasher throwback, similar to the late 80s stuff like ""Girls Nite Out"", ""Cheerleader Camp"" and ""Sleepaway Camp 2"". Courtney and her side-kick rock. Killer Panda was perfect. Tons of great one-liners, fun deaths and some great cameos from horror veterans. On a modest budget, this is a slasher done right, the way they were done back in the day. Campy, bloody, funny and even scary in parts, I recommend this title to fans of late 80s and early 90s slashers. If looking for Hollywood-grade scares, look elsewhere, but if you want a down and dirty 80s style slasher, this is for you!",1459814400,,594,4.721153846153846
