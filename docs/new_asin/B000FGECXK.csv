8122057,3,B000FGECXK,"I originally purchased this tape in 1999 and it finally gave out. Of course, I couldn't find another copy since everything is either DVD or out of print. But I went to my favorite website, Amazon, where I can find just about anything under the sun. And there it was! So happy I could have this tape again. The only problem seems to be it does not always play right away. It will get rejected by the VCR machine for seemingly no reason whatsoever. I don't know if it's the tape itself that isn't quite 100% because I was able to play other tapes with no problem. I am hoping the problem will resolve itself since this is an AMAZING stretching tape for the over 40 crowd. That's why it got 3 stars; it is definitely worth 5 stars as a stretching tape.",1334275200,,749,4.244755244755245
