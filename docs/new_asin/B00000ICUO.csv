1221885,5,B00000ICUO,"This is the BEST movie I have ever seen.  One minute you are mad as hell, the next you are crying, and then you are laughing.  The incredibly dynamic relationship between Vince Vaughn and his son in the movie will move you.  Vince Vaughn remains the sexy, goodlooking, manly, male while nurturing and  caring for his son.  It takes a look at single parenting from a view point  that is rarely seen in movies.  I have checked on buying this movie for  over a year and it remains at ..., so if the studio is listening, lower the  price so we can buy it.  This is definitely a movie to watch and rewatch,  and rewatch etc... I have rented it four times so far.",968889600,2,657,4.217741935483871
1221886,4,B00000ICUO,"I watched A Cool Dry place on cable.  It has been on many times, and I 've caught bits and pieces. Today I finally got to see the whole movie.  Vince  Vaughn is one of the most talented and versatile actors today, and he sure  shows it in this little film that I'm sure alot of people missed.  His  character is so sweet, and I think he did an excellent job portraying a dad  who is raising his son singlehandedly.  He was so charming and just a pure  delight to watch as Russ, an attorney who's wife abandoned him and his son.  If you are a fan of Vaughn's in any way shape or form, watch this movie,  you won't be disappointed! The storyline kept me interested enough, but it  was Vince that really kept me hooked in.  It was a little predictable and  slow in some parts. Vaughn and Joey Laury Adams have a great chemistry  together on screen.  I did enjoy the performance of Bobby Moat, who played  Calvin, Russ's son.  This was a charming little film that seemed to be  overlooked.  It's a definite must see for Vince Vaughns' fans.",967420800,4,1036,4.269430051813472
1221887,5,B00000ICUO,"I just watched one of the most touching movies ,A Cool Dry Place...it has  the most talented little boy in it that I;ve seen since the little boy in  sixth sence...the dad was so real...his love for his son was  heartwarming...the mom was one of those woman that we all know,but really  don;t understand...and the girl friend was the glue that held it all  together...I am so glad to see a movie( that I sat snuggled on the couch  with my youngest son) and didn;t have to mute it or tell him to turn his  head...A great movie for the whole family...and a lawyer that any woman  could fall in love with...thanks...",965433600,,613,4.410714285714286
1221888,5,B00000ICUO,"From beginning to end, ""A Cool Dry Place"" genuinely entices the viewer.  My 20-year old son introduced Vince Vaughn's acting versatility to me when he rented ""Clay Pigeons""; his cool, suave manner could ""best"" James Bond's  attitude anyday - and you have to love that ""unique"" laughter!  ""Psycho"",  ""Swingers"" and ""The Lost World:Jurassic Park"" are GREAT movies (between my  son and I, we own them all), but Vince Vaughn's performance in ""A Cool Dry  Place"" is charming and attractive!  Any actor who can portray a ""cold,  deadly"" killer in one movie, but yet portray a loving, but firm, Father in  this movie has ""Oscar"" written into his future.
Joey Lauren Adams was  well cast for this film.  I bought ""Dazed and Confused"" last year because I  also suffered from the ""screwed-up"" seventies and graduated from high  school in May 1976.  I completely related to that movie!  I thought Joey  Lauren Adams was ""Renee Zellweger"" - Sorry Joey!  After watching ""Big  Daddy"", I had no doubt that there is a BIG difference between the two  actresses.  Her throaty, sometimes high-pitched, sexy voice is enough to  drive Vince Vaughn WILD!  She may be a ""Veterinarian's  assistant"", but she  HAS MORE CLASS than the woman, Monica Potter, who portrays the ""truant""  wife.  Even though she is ""just"" the girl friend, she has more wisdom when  it comes to ""rearing"" children and ""what is best for the child"" and her  acting is SUPERB!
Bobby Moat as Calvin is EXCELLENT!  A beautiful child  and an impressive actor!
Like Samantha K. (Gainesville,FL), I wish I  could afford to buy this movie NOW!",962496000,12,1585,4.845864661654136
1221889,5,B00000ICUO,"You have to be angry at a top attorney's wife who leaves him and her little son, for some guy. The attorney is devastated and moves with the child to a rural area to become a basketball coach. Joey Lauren Adams is  his baby sitter and they fall in love.  She is beautiful but you will fall  in love with her voice, which should be recorded and placed in a time  capsule as the most fascinating voice of the time. Then you get even agrier  at the wife who shows up one day, for trouble making and trying to get the  son back. She gets her husband in bed and then tells him she never really  loved him.  They break up for good the next day, and mom runs off with the  kid. The baby sitter finds out about the brief tryst because he is honest  enough to admit it. Does she dump him? Well, she is understandably angry  and walks out.  He decides to go back to a big law firm, and now you are  really angry at everybody
But happiness takes over when the child comes  back to his father, the father quits the new job before he really started  and goes back to the cool, dry place and the young girl, who talked him  into getting the son back. She makes up with him and how could he fail to  cement his love with Joey Lauren Adams and her wonderful voice.
The film  is done excellently, even though the above description may seem  superficial. But there is nothing superficial about the feelings and the  acting in this picture. You may know what is going to happen, or hope you  know, but you can't stop watching.
There are husbands who do the right  thing and people who appreciate that.",962496000,,1582,4.186046511627907
1221890,5,B00000ICUO,"I saw this movie three times, and each time I found something else that I liked about it.  I have only seen Vince Vaughn in ""Swingers"" and ""Psycho"" and I must say that his performance in this movie was  wonderful.  All of the roles I have seen in him are so completely  different, and his ability to portray such different characters shows his  talent.
As for this movie, I loved it.  Very rarely do you see a movie  about a single father.  This movie shows that fathers love and care about  their children too and that it is not just the mother who can do those  things.  The child who played Calvin, Bobby Moat, is absolutely adorable  and he and Vaughn had a great chemistry in the film.
I highly recommend  this movie.  I only wish I could afford to buy it!  :-(",953424000,4,766,4.258741258741258

Such a treat to see Vince Vaughn inhabit a character who has so much texture and layers. The boy who plays Calvin is delicious.",1382832000,,246,4.880952380952381
1221924,5,B00000ICUO,"It was so nice to see Vince in this movie where his character had some depth instead of the way you see him in his later films, his smart mouth and the quick comeback. You see him show his emotions and actually grow in his feelings.  I really liked the little boy who plays his son and the way the relationship is, very real where you can loose it and yell at your kid and 2 seconds later realized what an idiot you are.  You can see how he is trying to keep it together being a single parent and difficult situations that come up. It is a movie I have watched again and again.",1373068800,,577,4.008695652173913

1221931,5,B00000ICUO,"Heart warming and beautifully scripted, this movie is wonderfully acted from the top with Vince to the the young boy who plays his son.  Didn't know Vince had such range but this movie proves it for him.  Great addition to anyone's movie collection.",1199145600,,249,4.767441860465116
1221932,5,B00000ICUO,"This movie made me reflect almost continuously on the life of a close friend and how he took care of two sons and a daughter after his wife left him more than once and admitted to him that she wasn't capable of caring for and raising her children.

Now to actors. Joey is delicious. In every role she seems to just play herself and she is so delightful. Monica Potter is ethereal in both her mood and her beauty but she plays this character perfectly: drawing us in early with her charms and later exposing her flaws with elegant alacrity.  But Vince! What amazing depth with which he portrays this gentle, confused, yet resolute and determined-to-get-it-right young father who first and foremost, loves his son.

Excellent movie.  It is all of FIVE STARS in my book.",1195603200,3,767,4.617647058823529
1221933,3,B00000ICUO,"This film, made in the late 90's, highlights a newcomer, Vince Vaughn.  Frankly, I've missed his stuff till he showed up in the National Enquirer dating Jenn Aniston.  Recently I saw Thumbsucker, where he had a minor part, a be-glassed school teacher and chess coach. Then the Wedding Crasher thing happened and we saw a kind of motor mouth, gen-x, comic.  Well that quick retort was foreshadowed in A Cool, Dry Place.  There's a wonderful manliness and sensitivity in Vaughn's acting that's tough to project simultaneously.  Think Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca. We can hardly blame Joey Lauren Adams from falling for him instantaneously.  Hell, I'd marry him.  Er, okay, maybe not.

Therefore, a reluctant dad loses his high-powered attorney job because he needs to rush home and relieve the baby sitter.  Mom had taken a hike, finding a man better than Vince.  Hmm not too believable, but that's the plot.  The kid is cute, dad is cute, and new girlfriend is red-hot cute, but then mom shows up. Thereafter the drama goes for tears.  Folks from the Mid-West do move along a little slowly, so the pace may get you drowsy here and there.  Still, I liked this film.",1162425600,2,1164,4.788944723618091
1221934,5,B00000ICUO,"'A Cool Dry Place' to me is a very underappreciated film.  It all but slipped under the radar and recieved little if any attention, but that's a shame, a huge shame.  This film has always been one I enjoyed, but recently having seen it four times in the past month (it's played on TV almost every day) it's really grown into one of my personal favorite films.  Vince Vaughn pulls out a brilliant performance, far more serious than most of his recent films, and he taps into something I've never seen in him before.  Vaughn I think has hit some bad luck, for he's actually a pretty good actor he's just not given near enough credit where credit is due, and here is a prime example of due credit.  Vaughn plays a single father, recently single, as he struggles to raise his young son (Bobby Moat).  Not able to balance his career as an attorney and fatherhood he decides to leave his practice and move to Kansas where he coaches basketball and meets a lovly woman played by the beautiful Joey Lauren Adams.  As there relationship developes Vaughn's ex-wife (Monica Potter) shows up to reclaim her place causing devision and turmoil in his life once again, and when offered an opportunity to take the position of a lifetime working for a law office in Dallas Texas he's faced with a crossroads...does he play working man or father.  This is a brilliant look at fatherhood and the sacrifices one makes for his family.  Beautiful story that leaves you with a lot of tears and a lot of heart.",1147392000,13,1486,4.535580524344569
1221935,5,B00000ICUO,"This movie is both touching and entertaining- the kind of movie that stays with you long after it's over. The characters and dialogue are very realistic, so it doesn't feel scripted. All of the actors are excellent in these roles, especially Bobby Moat, who plays Vince Vaughn's son Calvin.",1140998400,4,290,4.938775510204081
1221936,5,B00000ICUO,"I loved this movie. The acting was great, and I really fell in love with the characters. I especially loved the little boy. Vince Vaughn was great and should choose rolls like this in the future. I recommend this movie to everyone!!",1127865600,5,232,4.5476190476190474
1221937,5,B00000ICUO,"Like any reversed image, the different perspective helps you see the truth of the original.  In an absolutely brilliant ploy this film shows what happens to a father when his wife loses interest in being a ""family woman"" and walks away.  We've ceased to see the pain and destruction caused when it's the husband that leaves, but this ""new"" view allows us to have sympathy for the parent that's left behind with the kid(s). Vince Vaughn, as the dad, brilliantly plays the role as if he was female and absolutely rips your heart out doing it (I don't know if the idea was Vaughn's or the director's but it sure works).

One scene in particular stood out in this double role-reversal film:  dad has finally gotten his and his son's lives back to some sort of routine when (after 18 months) the estranged mother shows up on his porch looking for a self-indulgent visit.  Vince Vaughn all but barracades the door with his body and hisses a ""What makes you think you can walk back in our lives after what you've done"" speech.  Any mom whose been left holding the baby will instantly recognize the moment of realization that, where kids are concerned, the parent that left has the power to CONTINUE to cause damage and heartache FOREVER.

Vince Vaughn has never been better (he's easily equal here to his role as ""Lester the Molester"" in Clay Pidgeons, another underrated film).  Why Vaughn's not one of America's top movie stars is a mystery to me.  The actors that play the wife and girlfriend try but just don't have Vaughn's talent.  The child that plays Vaugh's son is NOT annoying, a nice surprise from a kid actor.

This film is worth your money and your time.",1109116800,8,1660,4.593220338983051
1221938,5,B00000ICUO,"This is the film that sparked my interest in Vince Vaughan. His performance in this film is so sweet and well done that I just had to have more. Imoved on to Swingers, the Locusts, and another favorite, Clay Pigeons. He doesn't seem to do films like these anymore, so this is definately a great place to start your Vince Vaughan collection.",1086652800,4,340,4.5
1221939,5,B00000ICUO,"The only reason I heard of this movie was because of Joey Lauren Adams, but I am SO GLAD I hunted it down!  It's such a sweet tale, but most importantly, it is REALISTIC.  There is no pure evil or pure good in this movie.  I found myself sympathizing with each character.  The casting is unbelievable.  Vince Vaughn and Joey Adams are so convincing and were cast perfectly.  The little boy is adorable, i hope to see more of him!  I bought this when I was single and childless, and now that i have a 16 month old and husband, it hits me twice as hard.  Definitely a tearjerker towards the end.",1039219200,3,593,4.232142857142857

Vimce Vaughn is such a talented actor and this movie is just one on the long list...
One thing that I really like about this movie too, is the fact that it seems so beleivable. You get an in depth look at the life of this single father and all of the aspects of his life. Personal, emotional and professional. You really feel like you're getting a peek into someone's life.
It's a great movie and highly recommended!",1025308800,4,629,4.206611570247934
1221941,5,B00000ICUO,"I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I couldn't sleep.  I couldn't stop and realized it was 5 am by the time the movie ended.  It is an amazing, warm and imperfect tale of a father who is left to raise his little boy by himself.  The movie is reminiscent of Kramer vs. Kramer, but it definitely carries its own story.  I always knew that Vince Vaughn is a great actor, but this is the first time I saw it.  The supporting actors all very good, especially Joey Lauren Adams.  I can't wait until this comes out on DVD.",1019088000,2,528,4.077669902912621
1221942,5,B00000ICUO,"As a single father, I really appreciated this movie's viewpoint on raising a child from dad's point of view.  Too many movies make the dad look like some free-swinger while the mom in the divorce is this abused single woman working two jobs to keep her kids fed.  This movie shows reality: that sometimes it's the mom who walks away from it all and dad has to step in and become both parents.  This movie was great, and the characters were well-developed.  The story was true-to-life, with things going good, and things going bad sometimes.  Vince Vaughn was great, and Monica Potter showed a great depth in her character as the mom who leaves one day without reason, and now wants back into her son's life 18 months later.  Joey Lauren Adams is nice as the girlfriend, but her voice gets annoying kind of quickly (sorry, Ms. Adams).  All in all, a great movie and definitely one worth owning.",981417600,29,893,4.578616352201258
