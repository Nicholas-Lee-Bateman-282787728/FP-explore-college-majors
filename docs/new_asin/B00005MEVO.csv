1624699,3,B00005MEVO,"I saw this movie opening day, and it's taken me this long to decide whether or not I liked it.  That alone should say a few things.  In the end, I don't feel this is really a three star movie, but I enjoyed it a little, so it's not entirely two stars, either.
Josie and her friends Melody and Val are in a small band, The Pussycats, and at the beginning of the movie we see that they are lucky just to rent a lane at the bowling alley for their first gig.  However, fame soon comes knocking when hotshot manager Cumming decides they would be a great replacement for his missing boy band DuJour.  Soon the girls have a number one hit single, but things don't quite seem to be adding up right.  ""Doesn't anyone think it's strange that all this happened in just a week?"" asks an incredulous Josie.
This is a movie with the same tongue-in-cheek spunk of the recent ""Charlie's Angels,"" but lacking it's constant enthusiasm and invention.  There are times when this movie soars, poking at the rampant teen-oriented marketing, and DuJour (led by none other then Seth Green) is a treat to watch as the all-show boy band.  However, there are also times when this bubble-gum movie seems to be taking itself seriously.  Shame on them!  A movie like this isn't supposed to be about insight, and that is the one thing that seperates it from ""CA.""  At least ""Angels"" knew its place.  The times it attempts to be touching are when we as the audience stop laughing *with* it, and begin to laugh *at* it.
However, laughing with or laughing at, I was still laughing, and left the theater with a smile on my face.  This is definitely not greatness.
But it's not entirely slime, either.",987897600,,1666,4.462046204620462
1624700,5,B00005MEVO,"Josie and the Pussycats was a very good film. It showed what should important to people... friendship. It's was also very hilarious. It's about a girl band who makes it big and discovers that there are subliminal tracks being put under their music. It's a great flm with a lot of laughs and I think almost everybody will enjoy it. Also to that 12 year old girl from Jamaica. It's ""And you wanna know something Mel? puppies, turn into dogs, who grow old...AND DIE!"" just making a little correction.",987811200,,497,4.595505617977528
1624701,5,B00005MEVO,"Fun, silly, and surprisingly a pretty great commentary on commercialism and consumerism which was surprising. But mostly a fun, hilarious movie.",1513728000,,144,5.904761904761905

1624703,5,B00005MEVO,"I loved this movie when it came out.  I thought it was hilarious and found it amusing at how much it poked fun at consumerism.  I was a weird kid, I blame being homeschooled, but it's part of why it's so great.

Also, it's got the teen romance drama stuff going on... which is another reason I loved it so much.  And the music is good times.

Lastly, and I didn't appreciate this until I was older, the cast is great!  I originally watched it because of Alan Cumming... because he was in Spice World, and that's who I am as a person. But I still think he's great.",1505606400,,563,4.1192660550458715

Pretty much perfectly cast (except for Alan M), with a clever tongue-in-cheek plot on consumerism. The soundtrack is also quite good, including the 2 songs by ""Boy Band"" Du Jour. The actors certainly look like they're having a good time...and so did I.",1473638400,,380,4.7727272727272725
1624719,5,B00005MEVO,I watched this through different means but this is one of the best live action adapatations of a cartoon I've seen in like... ever! It feels less like a soul less hollywood adaptation and more of the kinda magic you could only get with a movie that the cast just did for fun. It's got a heart that 95% of these adaptations keep forgetting to have. Something is very wrong when this is a better 2015 movie than Jem and the Holograms. This is a fun satire that'll leave you feeling good afterwards which is pretty rare.,1472083200,,517,4.34020618556701

1624725,4,B00005MEVO,"Look, it's a cute satire. It's actually fairly smart despite going for some low hanging fruit from time to time. It's about a billion times better than the recent Jem and the Holograms trainwreck, because it doesn't take itself too seriously, AND it has something to say about pop consumer culture.

Whatever. Parker Posey?  Alan Cumming? Rosario Dawson?  It's great. Music by Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo. What's not to like?",1466035200,,427,4.902777777777778

1624744,5,B00005MEVO,"Remember seeing this in the theatres the first time.  My friend and I thought maybe we had gone into the wrong movie at first because there was a boyband on the screen singing a song.  When we heard the lyrics, we knew we were in the right place.  Its a satire and obviously a satire, which is why it saddens me to see bad reviews for this movie mentioning all of the advertising.

Brilliant cast, witty, charming, great soundtrack.  Definitely a great movie all around, however it is not something most kids would like, I don't think.

I also loved the fact that the movie is filled with ads and the whole point of the movie is to be your own person and not letting society change who you are (i know some might not catch that).

Kay Hanley of Letters to Cleo sings Josie's part, kicking all kinds of *** as usual, on songs written by Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne, Adam Duritz (of Counting Crows) and other studio luminaries. Matthew Sweet's in the mix there somewhere.

The comedy itself is lots of fun, especially the hype surrounding boy band Du Jour and the depths of the conspiracy to brainwash the youth of America. Totally jerking!",1420156800,,546,4.7368421052631575

1624781,5,B00005MEVO,"I make no joke when I say that this movie was ahead of its time for its target demographic. And while I enjoyed the film, and got the joke, upon my initial viewing of it back when it was first released in theaters, I feel like its a movie that can only be loved once the 12 year old girls that the film was marketed to get older. I remember the trailers presenting the movie as a cookie-cutter teen comedy from the early 2000s (that was also based on a comic book that even back then had little to no real relevance to teenagers of that era). But as the movie played out to a pretty much empty theater comprised of me and my movie-mate (and maybe 6 more people) I realized how meta the film was (and how I wished its audience was bigger). And I loved it. Yes, you do get glimpses of what the movie might really be about in the trailers but you also got the ending of The Sixth Sense spelled out for you in its trailers as well if you were paying close attention. Point is, don't judge this movie based on its cover or simplified plot synopsis. This movie has a message that, while slightly exaggerated for comedic purposes, might actually not be exaggerated at all. I sometimes compare this film to Fight Club (and I do so in a serious and non-ironic way). It is a film that speaks about the commercialization and name-branding of a certain demographic (Fight Club served its message specifically to men, this film serves its message to teenagers). Now don't get me wrong, this is still a light, fun and funny film (that upon viewing it nowadays kinda also makes you long for teen comedies of the early aughts) and never, ever gets dark like Fight Club, but if you got the message of that film you'll easily get the message of this film while enjoying yourself. In summation: watch this movie for the fun and brashness of its duality. It's a film that I hope continues to grow in popularity throughout years to come.",1411862400,,1916,4.354748603351955

I think if this movie had come out a few years earlier, the type of music the Pussycats play would make more sense.

1624786,4,B00005MEVO,"Anyone who thinks that marketing and advertising are the downfall of society will LOVE this movie. It continually pokes fun at the big-time marketing machines that churn out everything from rock bands (like the Band Du Jour) and automobiles to clothing, make-up, food and everything else. Practically every scene is loaded with over-the-top visual digs at marketers. And the dialogue contains some great one-liners and sly references to pop-culture from years gone by (""Take the Chevy to the levy""). The movie isn't supposed to have a great story or even great acting -- that's not the point of Josie and the Pussycats. It's all about the ridiculousness of marketing today and how so many of us fall for it. But I will say that the mostly up-and-comer stars did an admirable job, particularly Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid, Parker Posy and others.",1409443200,,847,4.971830985915493

1624794,4,B00005MEVO,"Josie and the Pussycats are one of the most iconic figures in cartoon/comic history.  I had been both familiar with them from both the Archie comics as well as the Hanna-Barbera cartoon adaptation.  When the film originally came out, I originally did not see it because I was still a kid without my own money and frankly, ""remakes"" were popularly seen as always terrible at the time.  But seeing it, now, I totally wish I had been there to watch it in the theaters.  The film is not only a worthy expansion (Archie comics built off of it and added it to their Pussycats lore) for Josie and the Pussycats, but is a light and meaningful film that gives you some things to think about.  And definitely, the early 2000s film ""innocence"" is quite refreshing from today's trend of overly-dark plots and over-seriousness.

CONTENT ISSUES:
Well, as another reviewer pointed out there are two different versions of the film...a PG version and a PG-13 version.  That reviewer purchased the PG version.  I, on the other hand, have the PG-13 version.  And there are definitely key differences.  In short, the PG version is a ""family friendly"" version with all the innuendos, double entendres, and cursing either taken out completely or voiced over.  The PG-13 version keeps all of that still in.  So, if you are thinking of purchasing this for kids, the PG version would be a good move and you can find it here on Amazon (I checked haha)...and honestly, you wouldn't be missing much at all.  In fact, I dare say that the cussing and whatnot often felt out of place in the whimsical nature of this film.

But with that said, as far as the content of the PG-13 version, there was cussing, but it wasn't all too often.  In fact, I noticed more of it in the outtakes than in the film itself.  But the words do include the S-word, B-word, and the D-word.  Did not hear an F-word.  As to the innuendos,, I only noticed 3 instances...in fact, one of them I missed until someone mentioned it haha.  I was quite surprised at the scarcity (which I appreciated) since some of the reviews made it seem like more.  They were jokes.  One was when Melody was holding up different signs on the side of the road.  One of which was ""Honk if you love Pussycats""...except the ""cats"" part of it was blocked by a telephone pole...needless to say that did cause a car accident.  The other two were double entendres that can be taken innocently enough or dirty.  In addition to this, other points to note are that Melody does have a shower scene, but it is a shoulder-up shot...none of those body silhouette things.  And it's completely not portrayed in a sensual manner (think the shower seen in Alfred Hitchcock's film ""Psycho"").  Also, the fashion is very early 2000s late 90s pop star styles in case that is a particular concern for some folks.  But none of it really looks risque...as in uber tight and curvaceous.  Even the one dress that Josie wears to a dinner party with a lower-than-normal cut didn't seem all that ""sexual"".

The narrative is by no means ground breaking or earth shattering.  But it is whimsical, imaginative, yet believable and ""real"".  This is a story about a small town band trying to be heard in a world that won't listen to them.  It is also about best friends discovering what makes them ""a band"".  Then throw in a little conspiracy and that is what ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is.  The pacing of the film is fairly fast paced...but in a good way.  It does not feel rushed at all, but does keep constant motion.  But what really makes the film shine are the themes that it covers such as marketing, taking risks, and roots and identity.  However, what was especially wonderful was the relationship between the band members.  It's not often you find a film that chooses to capitalize and center the film around the Best-Friends-Forever kind of relationship.  And what's more, it's not often you find a film that does it well.  It's very touching and moving...how they each want to see the other succeed...and that serves as part of their drive to do music with each other.  There is some romance thrown in with Alan M., but that took 2nd place to the BFF nature of the film.
***PSEUDO SPOILER (ONLY BECAUSE THIS IS A GIVEN IF THEY ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE COMICS AND THE SHOW)***
In fact, even when Alan and Josie finally ""make it official"", it was portrayed not just as a joyous moment and victory not just for those two, but for the other Pussycats, as well.
***END OF PSEUDO SPOILER***

It's also so amusing how they poke fun at themselves with the fact that their source material is a comic book and cartoon show.  In the end, it is not the most groundbreaking plot...but still a solid and fairly well done one.

CHARACTERS:
Whereas the narrative is pretty simple and not too complexed, the character interaction is what makes the plot and film shine.  Though the characters were certainly ""modernized""  in the way they dress and speak for the sake of the film and connection with the millennial audience, the core of the characters are precise and to the point.  You can still very much see Josie as Josie, Valerie as Valerie, Melody as Meldoy, etc.  What's more, the entire signature cast of characters is there (besides the Pussycats there's Allan, Alexander, and Alexandra).  I loved the interactions they had with each other.  The only little quip I have is that I wish Alexander and Alexandra were given a little more screen time, and that Allan's folk music background was emphasized a bit more (though they did touch on it a few times throughout the film).  But all in all, the actors and actresses did their homework and were truly the embodiment of the characters.

MUSIC:
The film being so music-centric, of course one must pay some especial attention to the music.  I can simply say, the soundtrack is tons of fun and amazing...filled with wonderful pop punk rock pieces.  What's cool is that though they did hire another vocalist to be the singing voice of Josie, the actresses sang backup vocals for some of the songs.  And as to the ladies visually syncing to the songs in the film...they seriously put in a lot of work.  Their movements, strumming, and fills totally fit in with the music.  Even Josie's visual pronunciations looked natural.  Lyrically, it really fit with what the girls were going through.  And though the music was more punk'ish than the original cartoons, it still felt in character to the kinds of music the they would come up with.  I definitely would like to get the soundtrack sometime.

ALL IN ALL...
""Josie and the Pussycats"" was an enjoyable music adventure.  The Narrative was nothing new or complexed.  But it was solid, well-crafted, and well paced.  The characters really shine bringing a modern flair to classic personalities...and they do it brilliantly staying true to the originals.  And, of course the music is simply stunning.  This film may not be too serious (it is listed a comedy after all)...but it has tons of humor and meaningful moments that are heartwarming and encouraging.  And ultimately, it's just plain fun :-)",1404777600,,7122,4.676588897827836

Yes, it's fun and the girls are attractive (also featuring Rachael Leigh Cook & Rosario Dawson) but, surprisingly, ""Josey and the Pussycats"" shoots for something deeper. As my title blurb points out, this is an amusing and potent satire on the power and manipulation of the entertainment industry.

Alan Cumming is outstanding as the villainous band manager who uses, abuses and throws away at whim. His opening scene with the fictional boyband Du Jour is worth the price of admission! Parker Posey is also good as his diabolical superior.

Ever wonder why all those musicians die in mysterious plane crashes, overdoses, etc. at the height of their fame? How about all those successful government cover-ups? How do artists with little actual talant and songwriting abilities become hugely popular while the truly talanted artists languish in obscurity (like Meliah Rage)? Why do you sometimes have this insane drive for a Big Mac or Coke? ""Josie and the Pussycats"" explains all, lol.

As for the doofuses who complain about the product placement, they all live on Aduh Street.

The film runs 98 minutes.

1624852,3,B00005MEVO,"Josie and The Pussycats is a movie based on a comic book that was a spin off of the Archie series. I had a suspicion that it was really no good, but I wanted to watch it anyway because I like Rosario Dawson (Rent), Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That), Parker Posey (The House of Yes), Alan Cumming (Romy and Michele's High School Reunion), and Seth Green (Party Monster). It was kind of cute in spots, but it was born under a misbegotten moon.

First there was a parody of a boy band, called Du Jour, and Seth Green and Breckin Myer were in it. It was just kind of lame, as far as parodies go. This was mercifully brief, and then another story emerges. Wyatt Frame (Alan Cumming) and Fiona (Parker Posey) are part of a conspiracy to plant subliminal messages in music to get teenagers to buy stuff. The government is in on it, and even Carson Daly (played by himself) and Mr. Moviefone are part of the nefarious plot.

---------
Mr. Moviefone: Conform! Free will is overrated! Jump on the bandwagon! There is no such place as Area 51!
================================

When Du Jour gets wise to what is going on, Wyatt and the pilot parachute out of the plane leaving the boy band to pull a Buddy Holly:

[to pilot]
Wyatt: Take the Chevy to the levy.

Silly as it sounds, the subliminal message subplot is actually an improvement over the boy band parody. It is sort of fun for a very brief while, but it soon grows tedious. In this spoof on consumerism, they have over 73 product placements. Yet, they were not paid for any of it, nor were they given any free samples. Though this speaks to the film maker's integrity, it is really kind of stupid. Compare and contrast to the scam Madonna pulled off when she was paid millions by Pepsi to make a commercial and gave them Like a Prayer. The commercial played maybe once before being pulled due to disturbing Catholic imagery. Madonna got the money, the publicity, and then her brand wasn't cheapened by being used to tout sugar water. That was really a successful attack against rampant consumerism. Josie and the Pussycats, the movie, was not.

Wyatt needs a replacement for Du Jour, so he finds The Pussycats. He scoops them up and signs them, and within about a week they are at the top of the charts with millions of screaming fans. The subliminal messages also promote the band itself. An inside joke, one of the messages that scrolls on a marquee says ""Can't Hardly Wait' was underrated."" The writer / director team of Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont were responsible for that movie, too. I actually liked the musical segments with Josie and The Pussycats. Rachael, Rosario, and Tara were sent to band camp, and were actually playing (though I really doubt that it is them on the soundtrack, and Josie's lead vocals are dubbed by the singer for Letters to Cleo).

I love Parker Posey, but this was no The House of Yes. One cute bit of trivia is that Carson Daly, who played himself, hooked up with Tara Reid on the set. They were engaged, even, though they later broke up.

---------
Carson Daly: If I wasn't a key player in this whole conspiracy to brainwash the youth of America with rock music, we could totally date!
=================

Bottom Line is that Josie and The Pussycats was cute in parts, but the cuteness wasn't enough to make up for the majority of the movie that was totally lame. Can't Hardly Wait showed promise for the team of Deborah Kaplan & Harry Elfont but they squandered their good will with Josie and The Pussycats.

I was trolling YouTube for some video of the original cartoon and came across the PG rated version of this film that someone has uploaded. I didn't even *know* that a film version had been made. So out of curiosity I clicked on it ... and found myself laughing from the very first scene!

I've read a lot of reviews and found some people that just don't get the product placement joke but I thought it was hilarious, especially considering that the producers got not one penny from these companies. From the moment I spotted Seth Green in the opening scene I thought ""How bad can this be?"" Then I saw Alan Cumming and I just had to keep watching.

So I kept watching... and watching... and laughing. Then I spotted Parker Posey and thought ""No way!""  The cast was perfect but I want to single out Tara Reid as Melody. Let me just say up front that I have never been a fan of Ms Reid but her take on Melody was nearly perfect. I say nearly because there is one aspect of Melody that I think a human actor just cannot carry off and can only be done in animation. The rest however she did to perfection. Melody is not just another dumb, wacky blond like so many people seem to believe. She is innocence encapsulated to the point where you just love to listen to her and watch her antics. Just like Josie says to her in the film ""That's what I love about you!"" Indeed the only part of the cartoon Melody that Ms Reid couldn't pull off, and didn't even try -credit to whoever's idea this was - was the blinking of the eyes as she tries to process in her head what it was she just saw or heard. Just a great piece by Ms Reid.

I can't believe it took me nine years to realize this film even existed. I would recommend it to all and I will be buying a copy of it.",1274745600,,1796,4.149425287356322

1624857,1,B00005MEVO,"This is not the nimble, intellectual satire that the movie makers, and reviewers on Amazon, would like you to think it is.  Beyond that, it is insulting, and may actually be a vehicle for the very product placement/power-of-suggestion marketing technique it claims to be skewering.

The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be, and it manages to NOT be any of the movies it's trying to be: It's NOT a teen flick, it's NOT a comic book adaptation, it's NOT a clever social satire, it's NOT a comedy, biting or otherwise.

One of the biggest issues I have with the movie is the product placement and subliminal messaging.  If they really meant it to be seen as a comment on rampant commercialism, why didn't the movie makers use fake brands? Instead, the well-known brands and logos crammed into every corner of every frame in the film turn it into the commercial it claims to be railing against. Another reviewer felt this was downright deceptive, and I am inclined to agree.

Aside from the product placement issue, the movie has no character development ( I KNOW they are cartoon characters, but even as cartoons they have some personality).  The acting is, uh, limited: Rachel Leigh Cook mostly just expresses dull surprise, Rosario Dawson is given almost nothing to do, and Tara Reid can't even do ditzy with any conviction.  Posey Parker and Alan Cummings are reasonably good, but with this script they've got to work awfully hard, and their characters still end up being flat, one-dimensional stereotypes.  The plot could have been entertaining, in a goofy, cartoon way, but instead it just kind of lays there, waiting for someone to pick it up and run with it.

And why was it necessary to toss in a bunch of juvenile, vulgar ""humor""? Again, just insulting.

Originally, I was hoping to find a fun, cute, light romp with Josie and the Pussycats.

It really is a good set-up and one that is a great modern reinterpretation of the original Archie Comic (I would have loved to have a cameo of Archie and his friends). The movie follows a one week or so change of fortunes for Josie and their friends as they go from playing at a bowling alley where they are each paid $5 to be ignored by old men bowling strikes to being number one on Billboard. All the while, they are being used to make money. Of course, we have the classic fight between band members and ultimate redemption followed by the chance to play for real, without the subliminal messaging in front of thousands of people. And of course, sprinkle in some love and a moral or two. It all adds up to a relatively entertaining movie from the decade that spawned the ""teen movie."" Unlike some of the others, this at least has some redeeming and touching moments and I think it will definitely appeal to a younger audience.",1214179200,,1361,4.469879518072289
1624872,4,B00005MEVO,"At first glance, ""Josie and the Pussycats"" looks like yet another brainless movie aimed at 12 year-old girls. In fact, it is a very clever satire of the whole teenage pop-music industry. The plot centres on an ""evil"" organization (led by Parker Posey and Alan Cumming) that is hiding subliminal messages in pop-music in order to get teenagers to buy things that they don't really want, with girl band, Josie and the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson and Tara Reid), becoming unsuspectingly involved in their scheme.

In many ways this film reminded me a lot of ""The Brady Bunch Movie"" in that both of these films are films that don't take their subject matter too seriously and don't underestimate the intelligence of their audience (and are all the better for it). Both films are also filled with an ample supply of jokes (which are very funny) and ""Josie and the Pussycats"" has the added advantage that the songs that the Pussycats play are actually worth listening to (I also own the soundtrack and love it). The only drawback of this film is that there are too many musical montage sequences, particularly in the first half of the film, but that's just a minor matter and would not stop me from re-watching this film.",1210723200,,1232,4.757009345794392

I should state that I am not  13 year old girl, which is who this film was unfortunately marketed toward.  I am a dude, but I love it!

I originally saw the movie because of the music in the preview, and was really pleased to find myself laughing hysterically throughout.  The performances from the cast are funny and endearing at the same time.

The highpoints are:

-All the scenes with the fake boy band Dujour, which is composed of most of the male leads from Clueless ""That's wiggidy-wack, Wyatt!""
-The villainous tag team of Parker Posey and Alan Cumming who make this movie what it is with their over-the-top outrageouesness.
-The soundtrack is all original material and it is fantastic pop-punk with vocals by the amazing Kay Hanley, who is the lead singer of the band Letters To Cleo that sing ""I Want You To Want Me"" at the end of ""10 Things I Hate About You."" (Again, I'm a dude-but that's an ok movie, too.)

I guess I'd have to put this movie up there with Napoleon Dynamite, you either get it or you don't.  If you don't buy the movie, at least buy the soundtrack, it's quality rock and roll.

This film is a critique on modern music and the way everything has become corporate.  But don't let the depth of this film turn you away if you're just looking for something entertaining.  This movie has tons of that too.  It's perhaps the funniest satire I've seen in years (Alan Cumming is the man), and you will know why this is during the opening scene of the film on the airplane.

Keep an eye out for all the product placement in the movie, too--the studio received exactly no compensation for them.  It's all a part of the bigger joke, which I won't spoil here.  (A joke that is RIDICULOUS in the extreme sense of the word, but you'll love the writers for it.)

1624903,5,B00005MEVO,"`Josie and the Pussycats' is one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen. With a great cast, a well written script, and good songs included, you cannot help but love this movie!

The movie starts off with the boy band DuJour (imitating BSB, who were famous during the time this movie released), who discover something awkward behind the music in their CD and are made victims of a plane crash when their manager Wyatt Frame decides to get rid of them before they find out anything more. In search of a new band, Wyatt notices Josie McCoy, Melody Valentine and Valerie Brown of the group `The Pussycats', and instantaneously makes them famous so that the company's secret mission behind the music continues. Josie and her gang promise each other that they would be friends first and a group second. However, once they become popular, Josie's attitude changes, but will she realize her mistakes and bring peace in the end?

This movie was hilarious from start to end. Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, and especially Tara Reid acted out their part well as the Pussycats. But the credit has to go to Alan Cumming and Parker Posey for doing such a fantastic job on their roles, and providing so much humor through the movie. Even Missi Pyle (who played Alexandra Cabot) was funny with her expressions. The storyline, even though it is senseless at times, is totally unique and kept my attention. Director Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan (who also directed the comical `Cant Hardly Wait') balanced out the comedy and romance in this movie and did a first-class job. And last but not the least, the catchy upbeat songs were a great change to listen to, and I'm sure I will be purchasing the soundtrack of this album in sometime.

Even the DVD has some behind the scenes features and an audio commentary for the movie, to entertain us for a while. All in all, `Josie and the Pussycats' will uplift your spirits if you are feeling down, and make you laugh at least once.",1123372800,2,1968,4.665706051873199
1624904,4,B00005MEVO,"This is a movie that's much smarter than it lets on.  Bubbling just below the glittery veneer of this cutesie teenybopper comedy is a much funnier, more adult film that takes joy in skewering every pop culture phenomenon from fashion to product placement, oblivious pop stars who perform whatever's put in front of them, and the culture of deeply overproduced music.

The end result is about ten times funnier and more competent than it has any right to be.  Partly due to the fantastic bubblegum pop soundtrack that effortlessly translates the atmosphere of the original cartoon into a contemporary context, but also because of the awesome performances by not only Kay Hanley as Josie's voice, but also the talented duo who created the blissfully oblivious music of boy band DuJour.  (Of particular note, pay attention to the singer who suddenly - and hilariously - realizes the full double meaning of the lyrics to ""Backdoor Lover"" about halfway through the song.)

The product placements never stop; in fact, they permate this movie, literally woven into the carpets.  The cumulative effect is very amusing.

The performances are over the top, but as it's a cartoon adaptation, a little scenery chewing is understandable.  Also, for the most part, fun.

1624907,3,B00005MEVO,"For a movie that's called Josie and the Pussycats, it seems odd that it begins with a boy band. The boy band is called Dujour, and they are surrounded by screaming fans. They arrive at the airport to leave for their next gig, but they find time to perform a song (Backdoor Lover) on the tarmac. We follow them onto their plane. The film is mostly played straight, but massively tongue-in-cheek. There is more product placement than you can imagine - the inside of Dujour's plane is plastered with Target logos, for example.

Dujour is played brilliantly deadpan by actors who don't get full credit in the cast list - only Alex Martin is credited as Les. I recognised Seth Green (as Travis) but not the other two. All seems to be going well for Dujour until they happen to ask their manager Wyatt Frame (Alan Cummings, very sinister in tinted glasses) about a background track on their latest single. He disclaims all knowledge, but immediately leaves the plane with the pilot (in midair, by parachute). On landing, Wyatt makes a phone call: ""Looks like we need a new band"". He has landed just outside Riverdale, where The Pussycats live. Gosh, what a coincidence!

We meet The Pussycats playing in a bowling alley. The lead singer and guitarist is Josie (Rachel Leigh Cook, with red hair for a change); the bass guitarist is Val (Rosario Dawson); the drummer is Melody (Tara Reid). Wyatt runs into The Pussycats (almost literally) - Paradise by the Dashboard Light is playing, I think it should have been Band on the Run - and signs them to Mega Records.

Perhaps the only real flaw in this movie is the way that it tries so very hard to be arch. (Horrible thought: I wonder if they did that deliberately, given that the characters come from the Archie comics? Nah - that's too subtle for an American film) Most of the time it comes off well, but there are exceptions... Perhaps the weakest part is Fiona (Parker Posey) - the CEO of Mega Records - she tries hard, but fails; maybe another actress could have pulled it off, or maybe they needed a different scriptwriter.

Josie and the Pussycats make a record, and we see it climb the charts - interestingly, we see four top 40 charts, but Josie comments that all this happened in a week (should someone tell them that the top 40 only comes out once a week?). One of the many fun things you can do with your remote is read the names of the other songs on the record charts - this is a movie where freeze-framing and reading the backgrounds is rather fun.

Naturally, this being a teen movie, the teens catch on to what's going on (I'm not going to tell you the whole plot), and you can probably guess the rest...

The best advice I can give you is not to think too hard about the movie, and enjoy it.",1103846400,,2749,4.477045908183633

1624928,1,B00005MEVO,"I think in the years to come, when people are studying film, this movie, though a flop, will be discussed as an example of the large problem that product placement or ""brand integration"" has become in Hollywood. Josie and the Pussycats is bad enough to begin with (despite having the characters and general idea from the comic and early 70s TV cartoon, the movie really didn't succeed in transferring the feel of the comic to the screen -- Alexander and Alexandra are wasted); but when the viewer is assaulted by product placement throughout it just becomes too much. I have never felt so insulted by a movie.  This isn't a story, it's an hour and a half advertisement. Products and logos are so awkwardly inserted into every frame that I was overwhelmed. The filmmakers claim it's a subversive in-joke: I see it as deception.  After all, the moviegoer still had to pay to see this movie.
The movie itself is a travesty.  Tara Reid has the comic timing of a slice of bologna. Her Melody (with an oddly gin soaked and cigarette hoarse voice) made me miss Jackie Joseph's pitch perfect voicework of the cartoon.  Reid is an awful actress and it's agony to watch her try (and fail) to be funny. Alan Cumming and Parker Posey were entertaining as usual but I was ashamed that they did this and am hoping these were their ""paycheck movies."" Rachel Leigh Cook spends the entire film with the same questioning, bewildered expression on her face.  Maybe she was wondering what she was doing in such a bad movie.
Avoid at all costs. The one good thing about the film is that it may make people return to the ad free and infinitely more satisfying environment of books.",1082851200,,1659,4.610169491525424
1624929,4,B00005MEVO,"Someone's lost their sense of humour!
Well, I rented this video last night. I was pretty damn pleased with it, not least because of the pretty girls and pretty songs, and the back-door-lovin boy band.  Many bits made silly-ol'-me fall of my seat laughing , like the Honk if you love pussy......cats. This sets the tone of the film and introduces us to the completely gorgeous lovable wacko Mel). The plot is laughable, but so what? Very cute Rachel acting as Josie is a little flat but who cares? The film pokes fun at a horribly real cross-mass-marketing culture, in which all forms of media gang up to sell us the same products, and feed us the same drivel about what's going on in our world. But it didn't get bogged down in a lesson in ethics. It's a very watchable film, and that's all you need to know.
For those who go a little deeper:
How can so many viewers/reviewers/critics can miss the very very obvious running joke about the totally OTT product placement, and instead tell us that there's a lot of product placement in the film. That it becomes exactly what it satirises? Isn't satire all about the characters drawing attention to unpleasant reality by living that reality hilariously?  Lighten up!
How can anyone think that the ridiculous McDonalds shower-scene and Mel's urge to eat big macs after hearing their music played back through a ""processor"" will really make all the kids flock to McDonalds to buy Big Macs and Ronald McDonald bath-sponges? (I'd rather buy a shower with Mel in it, but maybe that's inappropriate)
There's nothing subliminal about all this, IT IS JUST A JOKE. Many seem to have lost their sense of irony. If we're assuming that kids won't get the joke, we're being very patronising. And maybe the fact that the distinction between
celebrating/slating the whole consumer culture is occasionally blurred in this film, makes the valid point that, WE  MAKE UP OUR OWN MINDS. If you wanna diet coke, get one, otherwise don't!
Recently, Justin Timberlake has teamed up with McDonalds here in the UK for a massive ""I'm lovin it"" ad campaign. No joke! Stick a Timburger in your CD player.
The fact that MTV avoided showing much about this film suggests that MTV felt targetted, not flattered, by being cast as distributors of the corporate propaganda. Not a celebration but an attack. Surely a good thing?
So..... cute likeable girls (esp Tara Reid), great one-liners and comedy timing by the pussycats as well as the other characters, bright sparkly production, fun fun fun!
 Did I like the film? Definitely. Would I buy the DVD? Yes, I think so. Was it better than Rock 'n' Roll High School which I bought last week (silly plot, stupid gags, great laughs and of course the Ramones)(...) well(...) that would be telling!
Some reviewers can't spell PARODY (parity, parroty, perrady). Can we blame them for missing the gags? Watch it again, I say.

When a boy band called DuJour begins to get wise to the record labels devious tricks, they disappear and the exec goes searching for the next big thing.  What he finds is a garage band called ""Josie and the Pussycats"", a struggling girl group playing bowling alleys and malls.  To their surprise, he makes them an overnight sensation and within one week, they are the number one band in the country.  But is there something odd about this?  Yes and the trouble begins when Josie begins to realize she is being brainwashed and their cd is also brainwashing millions of teenyboppers.
This is a tongue in cheek view of popular pop groups and teen fashion and fads.  The government and corportations are selling Big Macs, clothes and other ""must haves"" through subliminal messages and there is even an underground lab where every film star, cd and teen slang is created by corporate clones. From the Ronald McDonald infested bathroom to the kitty-eared headphones telling all teens to conform, its a perfect satire of the recording and fashion industries.

So why, you may ask, would an adult man watch a DVD of ""Josie and the Pussycats"", a movie that is clearly pitched at thirteen-year-old girls?  Let me explain.  I have the soundtrack to the movie ""That Thing You Do"".  Adam Schlesinger wrote the title tune.  When I found out he co-produced the soundtrack to ""Josie and the Pussycats"" I decided to get that one too.  I was impressed.  It really rocks.  Out of curiosity I decided to rent the DVD.

""Josie and the Pussycats"", the movie, is not an unheralded masterpiece, but it is a fun movie with some genuinely funny moments.  My favorite is near the beginning when we're introduced to all the main characters.  We meet Melody (Tara Reid as the very incarnation of the world's dumbest Dumb Blonde).  Melody is very sweet.  She stands by the side of the road and holds up a sign:  ""Honk if you love Hugs"".  We cut away and cut back.  The sign now reads:  ""Honk if you love Rainbows"".  We cut away again and cut back again.  The sign is now partially obsured by a telephone pole.  All we can make out is:  ""Honk if you love Pussy"".  A guy drives by and slams on his brakes.  Another guy rear-ends the first guy.  Soon there is a three car pile-up.  Melody jumps out from behind the telephone pole.  The sign reads in full:  ""Honk if you love Pussycats"".  Melody drops the sign and runs away.  Very funny.

The plot, or what there is of it, is a ridiculous concoction about a giant record company putting subliminal messages into pop songs to brainwash kids into becoming brand-addicted consumer junkies.  Do we really need Hollywood to remind us that Pop Music and Big Media are in bed together to exploit the youth of America?  Still, A for effort.  Parker Posey, as the villainess behind the whole conspiracy, proves once again that she cannot act, and Alan Cumming, as her effeminate foot-soldier, proves once again that he can. Rachael Leigh Cook blends into the wallpaper as lead character Josie and Rosario Dawson is an utter washout as Val.  The best thing about the movie is the songs and they are terrific, with Kay Hanley of ""Letters to Cleo"" pulling a Marni Nixon for Rachael Leigh Cook.

Adolescent girls will give ""Josie and the Pussycats"" an A.  Their mothers, who will see it with them in the theaters, will give it a B.  I'd give this movie a C:  not good, not bad, just mediocre.",1058745600,,2392,4.438799076212471
1624956,5,B00005MEVO,"Josie and the Pussycats brings the 70s cartoon about a girl rock band to the big screen.  Overall, people who gave the movie a pass the first time around at the theatres will be pleasantly surprised by this fun movie which pokes a little fun at pop culture and music.
THE MOVIE:
The Story:
Josie and the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cooke, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson) are a garage rock band looking for their big break.  When a huge recording contract and overnight success comes to the girls suddenly they realize all is not as it seems as they uncover a huge media conspiracy.
The Cool Stuff:
Its all about the story here.  All the observers, conspiracy theorists and pundits who talk about how much the media controls the youth of America has their movie right here!!  Overall, the movies a pretty brilliant comedy that touches upon issues such as these as well as simpler, but important, things such as remembering where you come from and who your friends are.  Some of the shots against current pop culture were pretty hilarious also (Boy Bands as well as the over abundance of consumerism) Bravo!!
THE DVD:
Again, like most DVD releases this DVD comes packed full of some great extras to enhance your viewing pleasure.  While not quite as packed as some other DVDs what you get here is a nice mix.  Among the goodies included here are:
1. Commentary  always insightful
2. Backstage Pass - 25 minute feature that talks about, among other things, the actresses relationships and chemistry and them learning to play together as a real band as well as their rock costumes.
3. 3 Deleted Scenes
4. 3 music videos:  Three Small Words by Josie and the Pussycats, Backdoor Lover by Dujour and Dujour Around the World by Dujour
5. Trailers:  The theatrical and teaser trailer plus trailers for other movies.
6. Production Notes  more insight into the movie
7. Cast and Crew Bios
THE VERDICT:
Overall this movie was just nice.  It may have passed most peoples radar the first time around but if you are looking for a nice rental for the weekend or evening this is your film.  The storytelling is very solid.  The story works on the deeper level as a story about friendship and pursuing your dreams.  It also works on a comedy level with its talk about media influencing the youth plus its bashing of popular culture and consumerism.  The DVD features, while a little fluffy, make this particular DVD a great addition to your DVD library if you are so inclined to purchase it.

1624957,5,B00005MEVO,"I just want to tell all the guys out there to get over their macho egos. This is an excellent movie that has probably been rarely seen by anyone over the age of 13 or not of the female gender. Yeah so its marketed to that demographic, that doesn't mean its not a qaulity movie. I would just like to proclaim proudly that I am a 20 year old male and I enjoy this movie to no end. I remember hearing ""3 Small Words"" on TRL when the movie came out and liked it. But, like most people who aren't 13 year old girls I thought ""I can't let anyone know that I like this"". I just forgot about it until I happen to see it on a movie channel. I watched it for about 20 minutes and thought ""this is actaully funny, smart, and entertaining."" It didn't hurt that I was a fan of Rachael Leigh Cook, either. Then I remembered hearing ""3 Small Words"" and just as I did the studio scene arrived and I heard them play it and thought ""there is no way I can live without this movie or soundtrack any longer."" So without seeing the whole movie I went out and purchased the DVD and the Soundtrack. Yes, I braved the strange looks of the cashiers and never looked back. Upon seeing the whole movie and hearing the whole soundtrack, I was hooked and proceeded to watch and listen to them incessantly. Rachael, Rosario, and Tara turn in great performances and Alan Cumming steals the show as Wyatt Frame. Breckin, Alex, Donald, and Seth are hilarious as the boy band DuJour and Parker Posie plays the perfect arch-villian Fiona. This movie is laugh out loud funny and whip-smart with an intriguing and original plot. The only thing stopping you from enjoying this is your tough guy image. Its okay to admit you love this movie. I am proud to say that I do!",1048982400,,1730,4.261398176291793
1624958,5,B00005MEVO,I just love this movie. It is one of the best movies ever made. It is super. The songs in the movie are fantastic. The plot is great. The actors and actresses are great. I strongly recommend watching this movie.,1045094400,,211,4.3
1624959,5,B00005MEVO,"I thought this movie looked incredibly stupid when I saw it promoted - and I stayed far away from it when it came to the theater.  Then, recently, a friend of mine wanted to watch it and I basically had no choice but to sit and watch it with him.  I really like Parker Posey, so I tried to make the most of the movie.
And, about two minutes into Josie, I reaized I didn't have to ""make the most of anything.  This is a really cool movie.  It's surprisingly very smart too.  It says alot about our culture today...all the consumerism and marketing and cross-promotion synergy that's forced down our throats (read an article in a magazine about a book that's being made into a movie with a documentary feature being produced for the TV and a video game set to hit stores by Christmas, right after the fast food Happy Meal tie-ins...Welcome to McWorld!...and spend, spend, spend!).
The movie is also very funny.  What horrible marketing it had when it was in theaters!  I never knew this flick would be roll on the floor hilarios.  Tara Reid is genius in this movie - and that's something I would never have dreamed I'd say about Tara Reid, based on what I know about her from her appearances on TRL or whatever.  Her character is hands-down my favorite in the movie. She has some really great lines and gags as the sweetly-stupid Melody.  She's worth watching the movie entirely unto herself.
The rest of the cast is really great too.  I'm not a big fan of Alan Cummings, but Parker Posey is her usual talented self here.  There's several great cameos in this - and lots of in-jokes for people who remember the Pussycats cartoon from the 70s/early 80s.
I honestly can't say anything bad about this movie.  It's one that I can see again and again and still laugh out loud over.  And the great thing about it is that hardly anyone has seen it.  It's one of those private little gems you can add to your dvd collection and take out to surprise and entertain friends one night.  They will totally make fun of you when you suggest Josie and the Pussycats...but I GUARANTEE you they'll apologize when the movie starts up.  I still apologize to my friend for making fun of him about his love of Josie.  But like I said, when I'm wrong, I admit it.
Seriously..give his movie a chance and add it to your collection.  You won't regret it.",1043452800,,2326,4.430588235294118
1624960,2,B00005MEVO,"Before watching this, I was sure it was going to be bad from start to finish. And, I was basically right but it did have some funny moments.
Yes, the acting was bad, the music was bad, and the product placement was obnoxious even though it was supposed to be part of the storyline.
Yes, it did bomb at the box office and deservingly so but if it comes on TV, then sure, go ahead and watch it.
I was mildly disappointed that the girls weren't wearing those cat costumes from the cartoon upon which this movie is based. They were so cute in those costumes in the cartoon and my brother and I were very excited about that when we were young.

1624961,1,B00005MEVO,"Haha! Got you there. This is in fact one of my favorite movies of all time, so I give this a 5 star. I am still watching this movie most nights since I taped it and I'm still loving it, probably because it stars my favorite actress of all time, the sexiest woman in the world, Racheal Leigh Cook.
Ignore the people who tell you it's [bad] because this isn't, honestly. It may be a kid's movie, but it contains some low-level offensive language, so that's what makes this movie even better. It's got some low-level violence which I was surprized to see when I first watched this movie so that's all sweet.
The movie is about 3 girls who had big dreams, now fate has given them the chance when they are nearly run over by a man named Wyatt(?), who currently works for a label called Mega Records, which is actually a label that sends out subliminal messages to kids who listen to this music.
When they record their album, their song hits #1 in the first week when they sign with Mega Records. Then things start getting fishy as you watched it some more, this movie is truly full of surprizes!
It stars movie actresses like Rachael Leigh Cook and Tara Reid plus other very good actresses and actors, so how could this movie get boring with those 2 gorgeous girls in it?
Even the plot is a bit slack, I still love it because of the acting. I was never a big fan on the cartoon series but I love this movie. It's very good, with my standards anyway, and I recommend it to anyone who use to watch the cartoon series or just wants to see a good movie. The songs that are played on this movie are mind-blowing! Even though I'm not a great fan of this kind of music, I loved it! Just wished that the 3 pussycats were actually a band! Hehe!

I don't own the DvD. I taped this on the STARZ channel one night while they were having a free preview weekend thingy. I gotta buy this in the next year. The actresses that play the Pussycats (Rachel Leigh Cook, Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid) have been in some other great movies. Rachel was in She's All That with Freddie Prinze Jr. Rosario Dawson was in Men in Black 2 (another awesome flick; I got the dvd for christmas). Tara Reid was in three of the BEST MOVIES EVER MADE! American Pie, American Pie 2, and Van Wilder! I love all those. If you like teen movies, the Pussycats are right for you!

I thought that the clever placement of different products and brand names (like the Target theme in one of the rooms, Evian water at the aquarium, McDonalds stuff in the shower, etc) were very clever, sendinga  subliminal message themsleves.

It is a brilliant satirical attack on the recording industry and how much marketing is tied into art.  It is so much fun. Rachael Leigh Cook is an amazing actress and I do hope that Hollywoods lights continue to receive this rather stunning young starlet.
The cast in the movie was great. American Pies Tara Reid plays the rather effervescent Melody, the bands drummer.  Rosario Dawson plays the bassist, Val.  Parker Posey and Alan Cumming fill out the bad guy roles rather well.
The Pussycat music is actually pretty catchy.  There were a slew of songwriters involved in this picture. Adam Duritz of Counting Crows and several others, wrote music for the movie that was later sacked.  I do believe there is one Duritz penned song in the movie.
The interaction of the group, the satirical story, and even the moderately cheesy love story, all give this movie an almost infectious likeability.  I never grow tired of watching it.  I don't know what was left out of the PG rated version, so, get the PG-13 or you may miss something cool.  This movie is well worth owning, don't bother renting it.

1624977,5,B00005MEVO,"Josie and the Pussycats is one of the best movies I've ever saw.  It didn't do very well at the box office, but its because they didn't market themselves correctly.  There are so much things to rave about, but I think most of the reviews spoil the movie by telling what its about, and I don't think the film makers wanted you to know because they never mentioned the other plot in the trailers.  (Yeah I know my review sounds confusing!)  But the other great things about this movie is that the characters are very likeable and hilarious.  The girls actually look like rock stars, and the music just makes you wanna get up and dance.  I swear after you've seen this movie, you'll have to get the soundtrack.  The boy band DuJour is hilarious, and I loved the I Want it That Way spoof of the Backstreet Boys (although the Backstreet Boys aren't a boy band, they're a harmonizing group)  although I wonder why there's four of them instead of five.  Alan Cunning and Parker Posey are just perfectly cast, and they're such great actors.  In short, JUST SEE THIS MOVIE!",1032652800,,1064,4.494791666666667

1624979,5,B00005MEVO,"Following the glorious example of ""Clueless"", ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is a teen comedy that asserts itself as art for the generations.  That also means, though, that ""Josie"" figures its teen target-demographic has a mind and a will of its own.  For this is a unique satire of teen crazes that also is in love with them.  The task is, mostly, to separate the loveable stuff from the pure drek.  Hence our film starts with boyband du jour Du Jour landing amid an audience of screaming fans to serenade them with the plaintive strains of ""Backdoor Lover"".  The winking irreverence of this sequence becomes more sinister when we later learn that Corporate America is-- but enough of that.  Suffice it that our real heroes are a trio of ""luscious young ladies"", played with zest and much aplomb by Rosario Dawson, Tara Reid, and Rachel Leigh Cook, who aspire to be both real musicians and rock stars.  Their punk-pop tunes like ""Three Small Words"" and ""Pretend to Be Nice"", though only huge hits in the confines of the film's fictive universe, are much better than what you're going to find on your radio, which helps to show how lovingly this film has been crafted.  Sure, it's a portrait of a dark alternate universe, but it looks an awful lot like OUR universe, thanks largely to the sledgehammer promos inserted into the production design (without any handouts from the companies involved).  And then again, with Cook, Dawson, and Reid as the girls next door, and gorgeous cinematography from Matthew Lebotique, along with a tourbus worth of saucy outfits for our heroines to squeeze into,""Josie and the Pussycats"" looks a lot BRIGHTER than our universe too.  Plus the candyland colors shine with an inspiring richness on this DVD, making ""Josie and the Pussycats"" even more of a visual epiphany than a musical one.  Alan Cumming graduates to the Richard E. Grant role in ""Spice World"", playing the world's most dastardly manager with wicked overthetop hamming, complimented by Parker Posey's catty crimeboss of a label head.  Some inconspicuous cameos might be found by the careful viewer too.  From the inspired wit of the opening image (morphing the MGM lion's growl into the delirious scream of a tongue-pierced tennybopper) on, this film is a high-energy celebration, as well as parody, of the madness of our popular culture.",1031356800,,2331,4.915816326530612
1624980,5,B00005MEVO,"Josie McCoy and her best friends, Valerie and Melody, make up The Pussycats, a struggling garage band from the town of Riverdale, U.S.A. They're gorgeous, they're talented, they're pretty naive, and they can't seem to get a break in the record business! Little do they know that Wyatt Frame, the main man at Megarecords, is looking for a new act, and he just happens to be looking in Riverdale. After the tragic deaths of the members of his most recent pop sensation find, boy-band Du Jour, Wyatt is desperate to find a replacement. When he stumbles upon Josie and the girls crossing a busy street with their instruments in hand, he signs them immediately, without hearing a single note of music from them. Suddenly, the newly dubbed Josie and the Pussycats are on a rollercoaster ride to fame and fortune, and within a week they have a number one song and a sold out concert on the horizon. But the girls don't know that the sinister music industry has been slipping subliminal messages under their tracks, using their music to sell everything from tennis shoes to Gatorade. When Valerie begins to catch on, Wyatt preoccupies her with the idea that Josie is hogging the spotlight, and when simple-minded Melody ALSO begins to get a bad feeling about things, Wyatt's boss, Fiona, decides the two trouble-making pussycats must be eliminated.
Josie and the Pussycats is fun beyond belief. A perfect cast and a smart, funny script carry this movie to a level few comedies have been able to reach recently. The potty humor is to a minimum, focusing the laughs on quirky characters and a great plot about trends and product placement advertising. Despite what some reviewers might say, this live-action version of the famous cartoon band does an excellent job of staying true to the characters, while updating them for a 21st century audience. The excessive product placement is meant to be a joke, not a huge ad. Anyone who says otherwise must have completely not understood the plot of the film, which is pretty sad since it was extremely clear and simple. A warning should be placed on the soundtrack to this movie though. The songs are great, with very sexy voices, but there is a LOT of sexual innuendo here and there. As for the perfect casting I mentioned before, Rachael Leigh Cook is gorgeous and talented as usual, a perfect choice, and definitely one of my top dream-girls. I only wish she had been cast as Sailor Mercury years ago in the live-action Sailor Moon movie that was almost made. Tara Ried and Rosario Dawson were well cast too. Though Tara's character, Melody, aside from being gorgeous, may also seem ridiculously stupid at times, this is only in keeping with the original cartoon character's personality, so God bless `em for not changing her! Alexander and Alexandra were well cast as well, and really added some extremely funny moments to the film, as did the hilarious villains, Fiona and Wyatt. Alan M. was also well cast, though extremely scrawny in comparison to the original cartoon character, but that's the modern image of a hunk I suppose. Oh, and Du Jour, the boy band parody, was too, TOO funny! Great casting there too! Seth Green is always hilarious! All in all, this is simply an awesome movie! You can't go wrong by buying a copy! Definitely rising in ranks to one of my all time favorite films. As for DVD extras, there's a behind the scenes featurette, great deleted scenes, a hot little Pussycats video, two very funny Du Jour videos, and some other little niblettes. A warning though, for all the other guys like me, who'd do just about anything for a date with Rachael Leigh Cook: Though the Backstage featurette will give you some adorable scenes of Rachael, including seeing her with beautiful, long, brown hair, and again later with hideous, chopped and bleached hair, ha, you will also have to suffer through her going on and on about how gorgeous the guy who plays Alan M. is. It can be a tough segment to watch.",1029801600,9,3958,4.746008708272859
1624981,3,B00005MEVO,"While in theatres ""Josie and the Pussycats"" - an adorably silly and sometimes-sentimental advertisement for everything from McDonalds to The Gap - did badly. Plain and simple, it just bombed. It barely lasted for a month, when three friends and me went to see it a week after it opened, there were two other people in the theatre. No exaggeration. Why? Well, I don't exactly know because contrary to popular belief, the movie is not that bad. It's juvenile and rarely funny, yes...but somehow the movie flows fairly well. Following a girl rock band from the bowling alley in their hometown to New York City. Where a desperate record executive, who is in dire need to find the next ""big thing"", before his boss fired him, discovers them.
Ultimately the whole ordeal turns out to be a test of their friendship and a hard lesson in life (at least for the three members of the band).
Rachel Leigh Cook and Rosario Dawson's characters, Josie and Val, are not exactly two dimensional, but they are boring. However, Tara Reid's character, Mel, is ditzy in an endearing way and the greedy record executive and Fiona, his boss, (played by Alan Cumming and Parker Posey) are fun, comical villains.
I'm not sure it's worth the money, but it is worth a try and if, like me, you decide you like it than by all means, buy it.",1028851200,,1311,4.6068376068376065
1624982,3,B00005MEVO,"My wife said that this was ""cheesy, but fun"", and I was desperate for a rental one night, so here I am...
The saddest thing about ""Josie and the Pussycats"" is that there's obviously a sharp, smart, and very funny movie buried here:  Du Jour probably deserve their own film, Alan Cumming and Parker Posey are hysterical, Rachael Leigh Cook and Tara Reid both prove they have a real knack for comedy, and there are plenty of funny moments (the Eugene Levy promo, the conspiracy that explains both Elvis' death and Behind the Music, Carson Daly's cameo.)
It's just too bad that the rest of the movie is so watered-down; the plot points of ""Josie and the Pussycats"" seem to be lifted, wholesale and without irony, from every other teen movie out there (WILL Josie find love with the sensitive folk singer? WILL Josie abandon her friends?) The music (besides the dead-accurate parodies by Du Jour) is bland and forgettable.  As for the product placements:  While initiallly clever parodies, they quickly grew so overbearing that they wound up being...obnoxious product placements.  I'd like to think that ""Josie and the Pussycats"" was concieved as a much sharper, much more ruthless movie before the suits and higher-ups got their grubby little hands on it and turned it into something that spends most of its' time pandering to teen culture instead of satirizing it.  I'd love to see how a director who isn't trapped by the Teen Movie Genre would have handled this material (Christopher Guest, perhaps?)
However, while the movie itself only gets two stars, I'm throwing in an extra one for getting to stare at Rachael Leigh Cook for 90 minutes (Yes, I'm happily married, yes, I've read my Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath, but, to quote Homer Simpson, ""Mmmm..."")",1027900800,,1756,4.8595317725752505

1624984,4,B00005MEVO,"I've seen both versions and here are the differences between the two:
The PG-13 version is the theatrical version, widescreen. It contains a bit of language and suggestive dialogue--enough to make it PG-13.
The PG version is an ""edited"" version that was cleaned up enough to make it pass for PG, which is what the original creator wanted. IT IS FULL FRAME. Every site you go to will say it's widescreen, but it's NOT. It is full frame--so be aware of that. Other than that, the extras, DTS and DD5.1 sound, etc, is exactly the same as the original.
Most of the edits made in the PG version are stuff you won't notice because they just cut a scene a few seconds early. (For instance, in the PG-13 opening video, Melody is holding a sign that says ""Honk if you love Pussycats,"" but the ""cats"" is cut off--in the PG version, you don't see this clip in the video at all. They replaced it with something else.) However, there are TWO bits of dialogue where they did voice-overs. Both times it's the bad guys ranting and you can tell their lips move differently from the ""cleaner"" dialogue that's inserted. It's just like watching a cleaned-up movie on TV in those two small parts.
I should also add that the ONLY place I could find online that had the PG version is Amazon. For both the PG and PG-13 version, they show the same picture, BUT instead of the purple ""Widescreen"" bar at the top, the PG version ACTUALLY has a pink band at the top that says ""This Film Edited for Family Viewing."" On the back it says 1.33:1 Full Frame.
Personally, I own the PG version because I prefer it--and the language is totally out of place in this film. But it's a sacrifice since you lose the widescreen.",1027468800,33,1686,4.441935483870968

Rachel Leigh Cook is gorgeous, The Pussycats' music is catchy, and the movie is pretty funny too. Some nice satire about advertising and commercialism too.

And finally, Rachael Leigh Cook was really kewl as Josie McCoy, the singer. I loved when she let the subliminal messages get to her and she told off Mel and Val. ""What's the matter snuggle-bunny??

And it really does make you think if record companies are brainwashing the youth of america with subliminal messages, because I know too many girls who act like the freaky fans.
I also think Alan Cumming and Parker Posey did a great job being the villans of the flick. I'm used to Parker Posey being a [mean] person because of her character on ""Dazed and Confused"". Anyhoo, this movie is for everyone, young and old :)",1022112000,,1480,4.346570397111913

1624991,4,B00005MEVO,"One word sums this movie up: 'irresistable'.  With a variety of cute characters, bubblegum rock tracks and satire of commericialist pop music it is too cute to resist.  It follows a rock group, Josie And The Pussycats, on their way up to the top.  The only problem is that their music is being used to transport subliminal messages to the youth of America, dictating trends and fashions to them.  This is certainly a great idea and amusingly, each scene is filled with promotion for other products.  By far the best scene is at the start as hit boy band Du Jour (including Seth Green and Breckin Meyer) fight and bicker in an obvious satire of manufactured boy bands everywhere.
Yes, so it's a one joke movie but it goes a long way on this one joke.  The actresses all look the part, especially the scatterbrained Tara Reid and record executive boss Parker Posey.  Whilst there are some unfortunate sidetracks into moral territory, with frienship and togetherness both getting in there, this rarely impinges on the light-hearted nature of the movie.

But like so many such Hollywood films, it doesn't much go beyond the premise.  After the first 5-10 minutes, we ""get it,"" and the rest of the film just recycles the same joke.  Film opens big, hilarious ... then limps to a weak ending.
Alan Cumming and Parker Posey are superb in supporting roles as the villains.  I wish the film was about them, instead of about the bland good guys.  The villains were interesting and multi-dimensional, despite their smaller roles.  Even when recycling jokes, Cumming and Posey's characters were a pleasure to watch.

1625004,4,B00005MEVO,"All right, so, ""better than 'Spice World"" is pretty faint praise, but ""Spice World"" (ASIN 0767808673) was another movie in a similar vein that was far better than you might expect. The basic plot (evil music executives using subliminal messages to drive fads) is kind of lame, but it's lame in a ""good"" way.
The premise facilitates unrelenting product placement and self-referential send-ups of all aspects of modern pop culture. For example, in the opening scene, the boy band of the day, called appropriately enough, ""Du Jour"", begins to suspect something is amiss with their music, at which point they become victims of plan ""American Pie"", in which their Target-logo-bedecked jet is made to crash with them on it. Seth Green's cameo performance as a spoiled band member who's upset because one of the other singers stole his ""look"", was priceless.
The plot moves along quite predictably, but the music in this film is actually quite good stuff, and the humor is consistently effective and far more clever than it appears at first glance. It doesn't hold a candle to great comedies like ""Bringing up Baby"" (ASIN B00003CX9A) or ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (ASIN B00005O3VC), but ""Josie"" does a great job of delivering exactly what you'd expect, plus maybe a tiny bit more.",1016668800,,1280,4.9581395348837205

1625023,4,B00005MEVO,"When I first heard they were coming out with a live action version of ""Josie and the Pussycats"", my reaction was dread.  Recently, I had been disillusioned by other new projects featuring old favorites, such as Scooby-Doo and Pocahontas II.  I'm not a fan of the original Archie label Josie comics, but I do love the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, and was worried how they might treat the characters.
 Imagine my relief when the live action film didn't disillusion me!  I didn't think it was a classic movie, but I came out of the theater happy.  Melody acts like Melody-flighty and innocent.  Josie and Valerie have more depth, but don't seem alien to the cartoon characters.  Valerie now plays bass instead of tambourine; however, and no mention is made of her genius with electronic gadgets.  Alexandra translates very well.  Alan looks like Hanna-Barbera's Alan in the face, but his body is skinnier.  A take charge leader in the cartoon series, the new live action Alan seems spaced out, like a stereotype surfer dude.
 I was most concerned about Alexander, my favorite character.  Hanna-Barbera's Alex is cowardly but friendly, whereas Archie's Alex is snobbish-the main reason I can't get fanatically into the Archie version of ""Josie and the Pussycats"", even though the Archie version came first.  Which way would Alex act in the live action film, I wondered.  He doesn't really act either way, although missing one of the band's gigs made him seem just a little preoccupied with himself.  Then there's one odd incident-I won't give you the context, but it's not sexual-in which he strips himself bare.  Not feeling either snobby or cowardly today, I see!
 Comparisons with the Hanna-Barbera cartoon aside, something others have remarked upon is how the film seems to promote anti-commercialism and not listening to hype, yet it has product placement to the extreme.  It's like the film is saying, ""Buy this!  Or...maybe don't buy it!  We don't know!""
 Another complaint I have with the film is that it had enough profanity in to make it a PG-13.  It's inspired by a G-rated, kid-friendly comic book and TV show!  Why does it have to be PG-13?  Having just a little sensuality to make it a PG would have been better.  Still, it was mostly the bad guys who swore.
 All in all, it's a fun film.  And it didn't spoil my memories of Josie and friends that I had from the Hanna-Barbera cartoon, so that to me made the film good enough.",1009584000,,2430,4.79277108433735

1625027,4,B00005MEVO,"While promoted as just another teen rock band comedy, Josie and the Pussycats is smart and sly, as well as being genuinely funny.  A satire on the prevalent band-as-marketing-tool phenomenon, the movie lets the audience know what it is in for from the very first scenes, featuring a Backstreet Boys-type boy band surrounded by a veritable plethora of product placement logos.  Using real companies' logos helps drive the message home, though it's important to point out--as the filmmakers do on their commentary track--that the companies did not pay to have their logos used, keeping the film from being too hypocritical.
Obviously, the movie isn't any too subtle advocating free will over following what's popular, but it's such a likeable movie, that doesn't really matter.  As Josie, Rachel Leigh Cook is perfectly cast, projecting an air of genuine caring towards her friends.  Rosario Dawson, as the constantly neglected black Pussycat, makes her character about more than just her race, and thus makes the racist attitudes seem so much more unreasonable.  Tara Reid, as dumb blonde Melody, adds so much charm to her performance that the character comes across as more than just an object of ridicule.  And Alan Cumming and Parker Posey are delightfully over the top as the evil record company executives, who even manage to make themselves almost sympathetic at the end when their own hidden sides come to light.
The extra features on this DVD are pretty nifty, though not the selling point.  I particularly enjoyed the commentary from the filmmakers, proving that if you set your sights higher than a typical teen comedy, it will show in your work.  This movie is so much better than it really has any right to be, and I'm glad I got a chance to see it.",1006473600,6,1760,4.922297297297297

A garage band 'The Pussycats' is formed by three girls with very contrasting personalities was given an opportunity to become a rockstar and their debut single climbs up to the top of the chart in a matter of week.  But there is something fishy happening behind the hidden curtain.
  The soundtrack for this movie contains indie pop almost like female version of Blink182, the main vocal is sung by Kay Hanley from Letters to Cleo.  Each song is very catchy and provides energetic atmosphere.

1625045,2,B00005MEVO,"Movie Summary:  The Pussycats are a band that hasn't been having any luck. Until one day when a record producer who needs someone, anyone, to fill the shoes of the last band that he just had to kill, almost runs them over in his car. He quickly talks them into sighing a record deal without even hearing them. It takes Joise and the Pussycats quite a while to realize that something funny is going on. When they do, they end up in a fight for their musical careers as well as their lives.
My Opinion: The only thing I found slightly interesting about this movie was the parallel that I dreamt up between Rachael Leigh Cook and her character in the movie. The fact that I had to dig so deep should tell you something. Anyway here it is. The movie is about a record company needing a star, any star regardless of talent. They took this nobody and pushed her on the youth of America with subliminal advertising and everyone believed she was good. I see the exact same thing in the movie. They needed an actress regardless of talent to fill Josie's shoes. She didn't need to be able to sing because that was dubbed in. She didn't need to be able to act because the movie was going to be a farce comedy anyway. They then put her in a glitzy movie and pushed her on the youth of America and told them it was good. Other than that, I didn't find anything redeeming or interesting about the movie. The product endorsement gag was played to death. It wasn't some brilliant master joke that no one gets. Well maybe for viewers of movies like Saving Silverman and Dude Where's My Car? it was pretty deep, but that's just sad for those of us who know better. And big deal there is a boy band parity. Wow what a surprise. How original to parity something from pop culture. It basically comes down to what you compare this movie to. If you compare it to some of the complete stinkers that have come out lately like Dude WMC? and Saving Silverman, then it might look pretty good. But if you compare it to an average comedy, then it's pretty sad stuff.

What You Should Do:  Steer clear of this one unless you are in the mood for a teen comedy. It's not intelligent and it's not going to go over anyone's head. Tara Reid if fun to watch, but other than that there's not much to go on. There's nothing offensive and I can't remember any swearing so it would be okay for the kids to watch.

Overnight success happens, literally overnight, and soon they find themselves being plastered on the cover of every magazine, albums selling like hotcakes and fans buzzing around them like mad bumblebees. But is everything what it seems, or does it just seem like they have it a bit too easy, or maybe their market-savvy managers have their own personal gain in mind? Directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont don't mess around with the message here: teens are overpowered by advertisements aimed at their insecurities about fitting in, and here they exploit that issue beyond logical sense (the shower curtains with McDonald's advertisements really stood out for me!) However, since the message is never pounded over your head, and since Elfont and Kaplan already assume that you already get it, it never becomes too self-aware. All of this is greatly helped by the charming performances of its leads, Rachael Leigh Cooke, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson, with winning support from the fabulous Parker Posey, plus a great soundtrack that just never stops.

1625047,5,B00005MEVO,"It takes guts to adapt a mindless comic book into one of the smartest and funniest movies of 2001. Harry Elfont & Deborah Kaplan (Can't Hardly Wait) probably lost out at the box office because their allegorical tale went far over the heads of most of the intended audience.
Contrary to the title, the story is really about two shady record executives (Parker Posey and Alan Cumming) who use music to brainwash the youth of America. After getting rid of the hilarious boy group, Du Jour, Wyatt Frame (Cumming) needs a new group fast, and he stumbles upon the Pussycats. Of course, Josie and company soon realize that things are just a little too weird.
The music is great, the performances are inspired (especially Posey, Cumming, and Cook), and the jokes are funny. Even the over-abundant product placement (for which the filmmakers received no money) makes me laugh at times. Movies this creative don't often come under the guise of a teen comedy, but if you look past it, you just may find a gem. Josie is destined to become a cult classic despite its meager showing at the theatrical box office. For those who get the joke, it's really good.

1625069,5,B00005MEVO,"I am astonished that this film has been so undeservingly underated. It strikes me that certain people went along with the intention of having an utterly miserable time if they saw anything less brilliant than 'Citizen Kane', then took enormous pleasure in savaging this film when it failed to reach their vast expectations. Frankly if you are so through an elitist in films that the thought of teenage or 20ish characters (God forbid) or their brand of pop culture makes you break out into a hysterical fit of ranting, then you should have known better than to stay away from this.
DuJour are an utterly devestating parody of a boyband, and understandably much of the first half-hour is spent in their shadow. Still our introduction to the Pussycats is well done, and easily establishes their current standing. Rachael Leigh Cook, a stunning actress with the largest eyes I have ever seen, is nicely done here. To anyone who would doubt her comedic talent - or lack of interest there in - just watch her eye movements in her first scene with Alan M. Maybe, and I confess I am not an expert, she is different from the cartoon Josie, but by all accounts that is a good thing. In the cartoons I hear she was a nonentity, here she is the core character of the film. While Tara Reid's Melody is perhaps funnier, Josie is still the  centre and Rachael Leigh Cook does it well. The other Pussycats have similar good moments, though shorter than Josie's.
Alan Cumming simply lights up the screen whenever he appears. While we are required to actually like Josie, Mel and Val (and they are in fact very likeable) Cummings Whyatt Frame is under no such constraints and it is entirely suitable that he is the only character to break the fourth wall. Posey Parker is almost as good as Cumming, but odder yet. She is good fun in the film, though not as purely fantastic as Cumming.
The supporting cast are okay. Paulo Costanzo as the Pussycats hopeless manager Alexander Cabot III is the best, but Missi Pyle, Gabriel Mann, Tom Butler and especially Alexander Martin, are all very good.
I'm amazed that so many people seem to have either not realised the product placement was part of the films joke, or have realised it, but decide to hold it against them anyway. The gag does become a little cloying after a while, but it does slow down a bit in the final half hour, and is never too distracting. If you found the product placement scene in Waynes World funny, this should cause you no trouble.
The music is of course down to personal taste, but I found some of it at least pretty good, and nothing more unmemorable than any other film track. '3 Simple Words' and 'Pretend to be Nice' are viable singles in their own right, and you will never be able to listen to a boyband again after 'Backdoor Lover' and 'DuJour around the World'. Rachael Leigh Cook, Tara Reid and Rosario Dawson do at least provide backing for their own songs, which is something.
Overall I would say that this was one of the most underated films of 2001 and the least deserved flop. What kind of sick world is it where 'The Mummy Returns' is more popular than 'Josie...?' Watch it.
Yours

I think Tara Reid is cool and played melody well. Same goes for Rosario Dawson and Rachel Leigh Cook.

1625071,3,B00005MEVO,"As a lifelong fan of Josie and the Pussycats, and a collector of all things Josie related, I was somewhat apprehensive when I first heard about the movie being made. What would they be doing to the characters that I loved so much? My first glimpses were not exactly enough to relieve my apprehension. But I decided to keep an open mind. When the negative reviews came out, I decided to ignore them until I could see for myself. I waited until the DVD release to see the film. This movie has a lot of clever ideas, some inspired performances, a great visual style, some enjoyable songs and some funny gimmicks. I'm not exactly sure where it went wrong, but I think that the performance by Rachel Leigh Cook as Josie was not exactly ""compelling"". I really didn't care about her in any way. The same goes for Rosario Dawson as Valerie. Tara Reid, who I usually don't care much for, did a great job as Melody. I don't think that she could have done any better. Was it the writing that created this problem? Probably not--Parker Posey and Alan Cumming were both fabulous as the villains of the film. Their parts seemed smartly written. Was it the pacing? Maybe--the plot moved pretty quickly, following the whirlwind rise of the band. Maybe I didn't get enough characterization. Was it the music? I don't think so--I enjoyed the music and thought it was at the very least appropriate for the sound of an all-girl smalltown band. I found myself tapping my toes along with the beat (and even singing some of the songs in the shower the next day). It might not be the sound of the moment (exemplified by the film's boy band DuJour) but I felt it fit perfectly with the band. I am glad that they left in the supporting cast, Alex and Alexandra Cabot and Alan M., but I would have enjoyed seeing more of them. They were an integral part of the original material. Should Sebastian the cat have appeared too? I think so, but I guess I can understand why they felt the need to exclude him. I think children would enjoy the film, getting into it's over-the-top product placement, color, and wacky fashion sense. Overall, I think this movie got some undue criticism. There are a lot of good ideas in there, but I really feel stronger casting and maybe a few more laughs would have made it more enjoyable. I really wanted to like it more than I did. Am I overanalyzing? Probably, but like I said, I am a lifelong fan. If you are already a fan of the characters, you might find something to like about the film. If not, you should probably pass (or at least wait until it's on cable).",998611200,2,2567,4.452229299363057

1625073,5,B00005MEVO,"Josie and the Pussycats is a movie that a person will either hate, or they will love it. I fall into the ""Love it"" category. I just found it fun to watch. Rachel Leigh Cooke, Rosario Dawson, and Tara Reid (Hilarious! ""I could be in this room - and in the bathroom - and in the closet"") made completely lovable characters out of Josie, Val, and Mel. Alan Cummings and Parker Posey were great as our ""cartoonish"" villians. Parker Posey was hilarious and completely over the top, but it was great. There are plenty of cameos: Carson Daly, Aries Spears of MadTV, Seth Green, Breckin Meyer, and the Moviefone Man's Voice! Josie was all about pop culture and pop references. It's more like a spoof of the whole ""Teen takeover"" thing going on. The plot revolves around a sinister plan. The plan? <Enter cartoonish villain music from movie> A major underground corporation puts subliminal (right word?) messages in the backgrounds of CDs that sells stuff. A la, ""Pepsi One is the new Diet Coke"" and ""Orange is the new pink!"" and ""I want an Abercrombie tee."" The organization is headed by Parkey Posey and Alan Cumming's characters, and they have signed Josie and co. as their new band, and their new lab rat. All that ensues in Josie and the Pussycats is good times, and learning how to hold onto friendship. The DVD has pretty good picture, and the sound is good. Especially during the songs. The supplements are good enough to satisfy any fan of the movie. To begin with, there's a 24 minute featurette explaining the whole movie, and has some great behind-the-scenes footage. There are 3 deleted scenes. The first two are entertaining, but the 3rd is just a tiny extended scene. Next up is the video for Three Small Words by Josie and the Pussycats, and 2 videos from the spoofed boy-band Du Jour (Which had Seth Green and Breckin Meyer in it). The Du Jour videos are hilarious spoofs of boy band videos. Rounding out the extras is the theatrical trailer and cast and crew bios. I did find one dissapointing thing. In Parker Posey's movie credits, they forgot to mention her role in Scream 3. That's what made me a fan of Parker. There is also a commentary from director and producer, but I didn't get to catch that. Although I'm pretty sure it was entertaining. In the end, Josie and the Pussycats is your average attempt at a fun movie. For some people, it doesn't work. But there are a select number that do enjoy it, and I'm one of them.",998352000,2,2436,4.563926940639269
1625074,2,B00005MEVO,"I grew up with the Josie cartoon, so I was excited when I first heard that they were finally turning it into a film. My excitement didn't last long!
First let me say that the movie, on a visual level, is quite stunning.  It's flashy and shiny- it looks great. The editing is impeccable and extremely creative.  Parker Posey and Alan Cumming (both who seem to be quite reliable in each movie they appear in) have the best time with their respective parts (they are the villains.)  Josie And The Pussycats, on the other hand, are an entirely different matter.  Rachael Lee Cook really doesn't even resemble the cartoon Josie (Lauren Ambrose of ""Six Feet Under"", ""Psycho Beach Party"", and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" would have been a much better casting choice).  Rachael does here what she does in all of her movies- walks through all of her scenes with a bland seriousness.  She usually looks like she just smelled a fart.  She seems like she's trying to channel Winona Ryder, but even Winona knows her way around a comedy.  (Rachael, take note of that.)  Rosario Dawson doesn't seem to be aware that she's in a comedy.  Her appearance in the tedious ""Kids"" flick has permanently put a scowl on her face, apparently.  You're making a movie that comes from a comic book!  Have some fun with it ladies!  Tara Reid, who has never left any sort of lasting impression on me before, is the only one out of the trio that seems to be having a good time.  She obviously cracked open a Josie comic book and watched an episode or two of the cartoon.  She embodies Melody perfectly.
The music is forgettable complaint pop.  It has sort of an unglossy, alternative edge to it (thanks to vocals from the former lead singer of Letters To Cleo- who I barely remember.  Didn't they have a song on the ""Melrose Place"" soundtrack?)- which would have been fine if the movie would have been made in the early to mid-90's when that sort of music was popular.  Perhaps the filmmakers were going for something a little different- to avoid a Britney Spears/Christina Aguilera-esque sort of sound.  However, that is the sort of music that is popular with a lot of the people that this movie was marketed to.  The vocals aren't quite screaming, but they aren't that melodic, and the tunes are all pretty unmemorable.
The boy band Du Jour that appears in the movie are infinitely more entertaining than Josie And The Pussycats- check out their bonus videos on the DVD.  Babyface turns in an embarassing cameo.  Carson Daly's cameo is actually quite clever, as are all of the product placements that fit neatly into the storyline.  It's interesting to me that MTV barely gave this flick the time of day when it was released at the theaters, being that they are quite visible here.
It's not a horrible movie- there are some good ideas here.  The execution is just marred by some ho-hum, unenthusiastic acting from two of the lead actresses.  It's pretty sad when the villains of a movie are what you look forward to seeing on screen.
If you weren't alive when the original comic and cartoon were around you may think it's great.  But if you are familiar with them you may find this to be a waste of time.",998265600,,3166,4.579040852575488

From its takeoff of boy-bands, to the running gag of endless product placements, this flick had me smiling from start to finish. Rachael Leigh Cook is solid as Josie, while Tara Reid is totally endearing as the dim, but not dumb, blonde Melody. Alan Cummings and Parker Posey are a hoot as the evil music executives who use the band to plant subliminal messages in their teenage fans' brains.

First of all, the plot is quite thin but interesting if the directors approached it a better angle. Second, the dialogues are bad. Third, the acting needs a little work.

I then learned of its incessant use of ad placements, which occur in over 75% of the scenes in the movie.  I was a little apprehensive to watch this after learning that fact, but I am glad I decided to watch it.  The movie has a very subtle attack on today's use of advertising, and it is a very well developed joke with a well placed punch line.  The night of watching this film, I had to get the soundtrack.  The music selection in this film is very nice, if you like female punk; though I never listened to punk much, I had to buy the soundtrack.  The other songs on the soundtrack are two parodies of boy bands, performed by Du Jour, an aptly named band in the film.  Both songs provide a humorous look at contemporary boy bands from two different points of view (one being slightly inappropriate for younger audiences), but they are subtle and only add to the film's approach to music and movies in today's society. While some of the humor is a little more risqu for younger audiences, I think overall it has appeal from early teenage years up through college students.

1625105,4,B00005MEVO,"A lot of reviews called this movie cynical because of the way it purported to satirize teen consumerism even as it sought to exploit it, not just through product placement, but merchandising as well.  And yes, it is cynical.  But here, I think that's a good thing.
It's not so much cynical in that cold, cigar-chomping-bald-white-guys-in-a-room-somewhere-laughing-at-how-easily-they-take-our-money kind of way.  Instead, it's cynical in that the-world-is-pathetic-and-there's-nothing-you-can-do kind of way, which is pretty bold for something supposedly  aimed at teenyboppers.  It's a cynicism fueled by genuine, palpable hate, and I like that.
This candy-colored film has a cold black heart, and it wears it on its sleeve.  You can taste the disdain as the camera pans across crowds of idiotically weepy music fans.  And any film which opens with the perceived death of a boy band, callously dispatched with a surprisingly smart song reference, while playing the bit for laughs is okay by me.
Sure, the characters are hollow and easily manipulated.  But that's part of the fun.  And it gets a bit silly and stupid at the end, but I'll overlook that for now.  Kaplan and Elfont have created a world in which there is no hope, no purity, only greed and sellouts.  A world where every aspect of pop culture in the last 40 years or so is revealed as the product of a calculated conspiracy, retroactively damning everything you ever held dear.  A world where this corruption is so pervasive, is it any surprise it extends to the film itself?  The message of Josie and the Pussycats is not only that individuality and free-thinking is hard, it's that self-awareness is no defense.  You can know perfectly well what's going on, and still get sucked into the machine and never look back.
This is a dark film.  If you stop and think about it, there are few films with such a bleak, hopeless take on popular culture.  I like it.",994464000,5,1920,4.953125

I wouldn't tell just ANYONE to go out and rent this movie though. I suggest that music loving teens should go see it; it focuses on gurls (for the guys) and a good plot (for the gurls).
THE PLOT: A boy band called Du Jour is making it well in their careers. After an awful plane crash they are thought dead and their manager gows out to find a new band/group to take their place. A band called the Pussycats aren't doing so good though; their manager and his sis aren't making life easier and playing in Bowling Allies and Street Corners isn't that great. Finally their talent is spotted by the manager of the forgotten Du Jour.

With subliminal messaging and hard times ahead, the Pussycats have to brave through the upper world and come out friends as always.

The story of an all girl punk-rock band signed by an unscrupulous manager of a record company (excellent Alan Cumming as Wyatt) playing with the consuming brains of the teenagers.

And Josie has a hard times communicating her true feelings to Alan M., who woos her mostly when his truck breaks down... Three ways to enjoy is to not take it seriously, see it as a good old Archie comic and have fun. The caracters are simply cartoonesque (mostly Parker Posey and Alan Cumming).

Old fans of the comic book like me will miss the skin tight leopard suits, but the soundtrack is great. Even the boys bands like the Backstreet Boys are spoofed as a group called ""DuJour"".

Some moments are funny, but others seem to fail to capture the fun and imagination that the cartoon had.
  The film follows three singer/songwriters who happen to dress like cats.  They hit it big, and have to adjust to their new surroundings.  I think I summorized in 2 sentenses what took about and hour and a half to explain in the movie( that should say something).
  One of the reasons I found the movie to be stupid, was because they were going against what they were preaching.  They try to fight against commercialization, yet the movie is a walking promo for Target, Ray Ban, and other major companies.

The music is addictive (although the band starts out grrl-pop-punk and by the last musical number has slammed head first into typical teenage pap love ballad), the plot is painfully expected, but it shamelessly rips on its target market - consumerist pre-teen girls dropping disposable cash into the...money making machine.

They're gorgeous, they're talented, they're a little naive, and they can't seem to get a break in the record business! Little do they know that Wyatt Frame, the main man at Megarecords, is looking for a new act, and he just happens to be looking in Riverdale. After the tragic deaths of the members of his most recent pop sensation find, boy-band Du Jour, Wyatt is desperate to find a replacement. When he stumbles upon Josie and the girls crossing a busy street with their instruments in hand, he signs them immediately without hearing a single note of music from them. Suddenly, the newly dubbed ""Josie and the Pussycats"" are on a rollercoaster ride to fame and fortune, and within a week they have a number one song and a sold out concert on the horizon. But the girls don't know that the sinister music industry has been slipping subliminal messages under their tracks, using their music to sell everything from tennis shoes to Gatorade. When Valerie begins to catch on, Wyatt preoccupies her with the idea that Josie is hogging the spotlight, and when simple-minded Melody ALSO begins to get a bad feeling about things, Wyatt's boss, Fiona, decides the two trouble-making pussycats must be eliminated.

Josie and the Pussycats is fun beyond belief. A perfect cast and a smart, funny script carry this movie to a level few comedies have been able to reach recently. The potty humor is to a minimum, focusing the laughs on quirky characters and a great plot about trends and product placement advertising. Despite what some reviewers might say, this live-action version of the famous cartoon band does an excellent job of staying true to the characters while updating them for a 21st century audience. The excessive product placement is meant to be a joke, not a huge ad. Anyone who says otherwise must have completely missed the point of the film, which is pretty sad since it was extremely clear and simple. A warning should be placed on the soundtrack to this movie though. The songs are great, with very sexy voices, but there is a LOT of sexual innuendo here and there. As for the perfect casting I mentioned before, Rachael Leigh Cook is gorgeous and talented as usual, a perfect choice, and definitely one of my top dream-girls. I only wish she had been cast as Sailor Mercury years ago in the live-action Sailor Moon movie that was almost made. Tara Ried and Rosario Dawson were excellent also. Though Tara's character, Melody, aside from being gorgeous, may also seem ridiculously stupid at times, this is only in keeping with the original cartoon character's personality, so God bless 'em for not changing her! Alexander and Alexandra were well cast as well, and really added some extremely funny moments to the film, as did the hilarious villains, Fiona and Wyatt. Alan M. was also nicely cast, though extremely scrawny in comparison to the original cartoon character, but that's the modern image of a hunk I suppose. Oh, and Du Jour, the boy band parody, was too, TOO funny! Great casting there too! Seth Green is always hilarious! All in all, this is simply an awesome movie! Definitely one of my all-time favorite films. As for DVD extras, there's a behind the scenes featurette, great deleted scenes, a hot little Pussycats video, two very funny Du Jour videos, and some other little niblettes. A warning though, for all the other guys like me who'd do just about anything for a date with Rachael Leigh Cook: Though the Backstage featurette will give you some adorable scenes of Rachael, including seeing her with beautiful, long, brown hair, and again later with hideous, chopped and bleached hair, ha, you will also have to suffer through her going on and on about how gorgeous the guy who plays Alan M. is.

1625112,3,B00005MEVO,"First the good:
This is movie that doesn't underestimate the audience. If you go into this movie expecting a lot of popculture references, mindless dialouge, and loads of pop music, that's exactly what you will get! They also make the point that teenagers have become nothing but mindless consumers that will by anything as long as their friends think it is ""in."" Individuallity doesn't even exist, the only thing that counts is the next big thing!
The bad:
As I stated this is product placement theater! Every, and I do mean every company out there has their own little spot in the movie. Some of them are funny, such as the Evian logo being placed in fish tank, but it gets way out of hand and it gets in the way of the story! The story, by the way, is about as transparent as saran wrap, and I could describe the acting using the same reference.
Bottom line, if you are between 13 and 18, you'll think that this movie will get the Best Picture award at the Oscars. If your over that age, well, quite frankly, you won't understand it!",990921600,,1036,4.429319371727749
1625123,5,B00005MEVO,"Aside from the amazingly beautiful Rachael Leigh Cook, the movie was hilarious.  This was one of the first satire films that I've seen in a long time (in fact, I don't recall ever seeing a satire from my generation).  It was funny.  That's the bottom line ... and Rachael Leigh Cook was in it.  What more do you need to know?",990835200,,325,4.278688524590164
1625124,3,B00005MEVO,"I enjoyed the acting. But overall the movie was stupid.  I would of prefured the cartoon over the movie.  It did have its funny moments.  I would say little girls will love it.  Teens could go eaither way.  adults will hate it or think its cute.  Wait for video for this one.  I had seen so much promotion for it in magazines, tv, and radio and went to see it thinking about how great it was going to be.  I ended up comeing out disapointed!",990403200,,441,4.105882352941176
1625125,2,B00005MEVO,"This movie made me realize that I'm getting old.  I know that I'm sure most teenagers would find this movie hilarious and super cool, but I thought it was a complete waste of time.  The two stars are strictly for the hot girls in it.  I understand that the movie was trying to discuss the idea of fads and ""selling out"" in American today, but that's not really something you can do with a highly commercial movie like this.  The ads plastered all over the movie making fun of ad placement doesn't make sense cause even if they are making fun, they're still placing ads for all those companies and are still getting free products or money for those huge advertisements.  I also couldn't stand the fact that every 10 minutes they found some other reason to sing another song.  Why?  This wasn't Josie and the Pussycats.  Josie and the Pussycats was like a female Scooby Doo.  They should have just dropped the Hanna Barbara license and just made a movie about a band trying to make it.  This would make the film less commercial and then there would be the huge advertising accompanying the movie, with posters, tv spots, billboards, toys, lunchboxes, and everything else the movie makes fun of!",990230400,,1192,4.606635071090047
1625126,4,B00005MEVO,"Okay so I am a little older than the target audience for the film.  But I have to say right off that Josie was FUN!  I have been a fan of punk/power pop for over 25 years, and the music itself was marvellous.  But when you add the funny, and campy story right out of the tv show, you have a winner!  For those of you either too old or too young to have seen Josie on TV.  Let me tell you that the story was something that would have been a great original episode of the series.  Yes it was a little goofy, but that was the whole idea.  It was something to enjoy, not critique.  If you couldn't enjoy this film, you are either too darn old or just too serious to ever just have fun.",989452800,,681,3.8840579710144927
1625127,5,B00005MEVO,"I went to this movie expecting nothing more than to watch Rachel Leigh Cook (Josie) and Tara Ried (Mel) dance around on stage in skimpy outfits.  Imagine my surprise one of the funniest opening scenes I have ever seen! From the boy band named ""Du Jour"" (I guarantee my roommate and I were the only 2 people in the entire theatre filled with 13 year old girls who got that joke) and their hit single ""Backdoor Lover"" to the rediculous product placements and government conspiracy to put subliminal messages and advertisements in our music, thereby controlling trends and keeping teenagers buying the next best thing.  Younger viewers who don't necissarily get the humor will enjoy the music and the unbelieveable plotline and love story while older viewers will enjoy the hilarious and almost plausible hyperbole of the conspiracy.",988848000,14,830,5.007246376811594
1625128,1,B00005MEVO,"Roger Ebert gave this film 1/2 a star...he was too kind. First off I want to apologize, I really do. I'm sorry for breaking my new years resolution so soon.  I resolved that I would never again write a negative review on amazon, that I was always trashing everything and I was making people angry and that if I didn't like something I should shut up about it.  Then I saw Josie and the Pussycats.  I have never been more embarrassed for a bunch of actors.  I loved Charlie's Angles and thought this would be like that only with guitars, I was primed for some cool 70's retro music and some silly fun.  This movie was painful.  I have never seen worse acting, never.  If you watch you can see Parker Posie looking around as if she is waiting for the director to yell cut.  Someone should have.  The same tired old joke is rehashed countles times, that product placement is everywhere, Target logos inside the plane etc..  This was mildly funny once.  Once.  Rachel Leigh Cook is unsinkable.  She is so beautiful that she can make a film better simply by standing there, she is incapable of delivering a bad line no matter how poorly it is written, bravo Rachel, you poor brave girl.  To screw up a film like this takes hideous directing, editing and writing.  The jokes are old, the story is lame and the acting must be seen to be believed.  I was ashamed leaving the theater that someone would have seen me there, I need not have worried there were, perhaps 3 people in the whole multiplex...three too many.",988761600,,1507,4.445255474452555

WOW best i have ever seen if you haven't seen this you have NO idea what you've missed all these actors did one hell of a job in this movie being funny,sexy,crazy,and cool mostly at the end of the movie when they have the coolest cocert of all time so if you haven't seen this in theaters buy it whaen this comes to video you'll love it  :)",988070400,2,383,4.2465753424657535
1625130,5,B00005MEVO,"When I heard there was going to be a ""Josie and the Pussycats"" movie, I first though ""oh, no!  NOT ANOTHER HANNA-BARBERA CARTOON ADAPTED TO SCREEN (The flintstones)!!!"" but when I saw it with my friends on the first night of Spring Break, I was laughing the whole time out.  Here's the basic story: Josie (played by Rachel Lee Cook) is the leader of the band ""The Pussycats"" who her friends Mel (Tara Reid) and Val (Rosario Dawson) are also in.  But so far, there lousy manager and his annoying sister aren't doing anything to raise their music career.  Meanwhile, a major pop music Manager, Whyle (played by Broadway fame, Alan Cumming) just dumped a big pop boy band because they found out they had sublimital messages in there lyrics.  He then finds Josie and her pussycats, and signs them to Mega Records, who the owner, named Fiona (Parker Posey) was a High school loser becoming the world's most popular.  The team is then truned on each other when the messages in ""their"" songs brainwash Josie.  The three then must fight back against the evil corporation.
JATPC is an a hilarious mock of teen pop culture that everyone knows about (The boybands that are fake, pop artists that don't sing and, of course, Sublimital messages in song lyrics).  Athough the actors don't really sing (what, you really thought they did?)  they are great in the movie, espically Tara Reid, wom her charecter Mel is either a Dumb Blonde or a loving girl who loves everything.  Reid's fiance, TRL's Carson Daly makes a cameo in the film as, well, himself only controlled by the evil corp.  Also, for anyone who lives in Huntington Beach or Orange County, you will root when one of the Charecters says he went to Huntington High School.  Plus, the city of Riverdale is where the Pussycats live.  Great film for teens that love pop culture or just what a laugh!",987897600,5,1842,4.648148148148148
