3833604,4,B0021L8UIU,"It's hard to dislike this quirky little film of teen angst and the trials of prom night anticipation. It's refreshing to see a great cast in a short film that is both funny and insightful.

Macy is always good and the teen cast is natural, but in the end it's really just a pleasant film to watch.....which isn't so bad!....is it?
The DVD transfer is very good with some interesting extras.",1248566400,2,390,4.492957746478873
3833605,3,B0021L8UIU,"What I liked about ""Bart Got a Room"" is its easygoing charm.  This is not one of those frenetic, loud teen comedies in which implausible characters engage in outrageous actions that in no way resemble reality.  Here we have the story of high school senior Danny (Steven Kaplan), who's spent a small fortune on the hotel room, limo, and tux for his prom.  What he doesn't have is a date.  The always-wonderful William H. Macy, complete with black curly wig, and Cheryl Hines play Steven's divorced parents, both self-absorbed with seeking relationships of their own.  ""Bart Got a Room"" is not a rollicking movie with wisecarcks issuing forth from precocious teens' mouths every few seconds.  The comedy is more about Steven's awkwardness in deciding who to take to the prom.  Since he's not the cliched football hero girls would be eager to accompany to the prom,  Steven is sympathetic with his ordinary looks, gentle temperament, and overall sweetness. Alia Shawkat is very good as Camille, Steven's longtime friend, and Jennifer Tilly pops up as an overly amorous woman Steven's dad met online.  There are wonderful little moments here and there of South Floridians doing what they do -- hanging out on the beach, playing cards, having the Early Bird Special, listening to a sparsely-attended concert of 40's music -- which add nice atmosphere to the movie.  There is a brief scene at the beginning of Steven and his family having dinner.  The interaction here is very funny, in a natural way, and I'd like to have seen more. There's comic potential in some supporting characters that is not fully mined.  As far as the bonus extras, I wasn't able to access the Pop-Up Production Notebook and the theatrical trailer.  I don't know if this is an inherent problem with the release or unique to the disc I watched.  The movie itself played perfectly.",1248480000,4,1849,4.865814696485623
3833606,4,B0021L8UIU,"From the moment that Bart Got a Room opens with a teenage Big Band playing Benny Goodman's Sing Sing Sing for a bunch of post-Alzheimer's Jewish retirees on a Miami Beach, you get the feeling this is not just another teen comedy.  It may have been the nerdy coming-of-age narrative or the Jewish family trappings, but for some reason, I kept thinking of Neal Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs.  And I mean that to be taken in a complimentary light.

It's almost time for the Prom, and high school senior Danny has a problem.  His newly divorced parents, engagingly played by William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines, assume he's taking Camille (Alia Shawkat), his platonic best friend of nine years.  But Danny has other plans - he wants to ask Alice, the flirtatious young sophomore he drives to school.  But Danny has been reading the signs of her interest all wrong, thanks to the bad advice of his father, and when Alice turns him down for the prom and walks out of his life, well, his time to procure a date is rapidly running out.

Although ostensibly not much more than your standard teen flick, Bart's Got a Room has some surprisingly adult and well-crafted humor, and despite the ending that I predicted shortly into the second scene, there was a lot of feel-good moments and some genuine laughs.  Chief among these was the sub-plot involving Danny's desire to see his parents get back together, more than a few very adult and funny situations, and a hilarious cameo by Jennifer Tilly, who steals the movie as a sex-hungry dinner-date that Danny's father meets on the Internet.  Newcomer Steve Kaplan is engaging as Danny, and the film is uniformly well acted and cast.

This certainly was not the worst 80 minutes or so I've spent on a film recently, and in the end, I found I enjoyed this little comedy more than I expected to.  Probably the best thing about it was the fact that it didn't seem to be written to appeal to teens, and was totally devoid of the puerile adolescent humor one expects to find in films of this sort.  And that was a pleasant surprise.",1248480000,,2061,4.5858310626703
3833607,5,B0021L8UIU,"This is one of the best made prom movies I have seen. It has a great cast and a unusual look. The main character, Danny, is described as a nerd, but he is more complex than that. In fact, he is somewhat of an enigma. A nerd would lack self-confidence, especially with girls, but Danny seems quite comfortable with them. He also seems to be oblivious(even though quite intelligent otherwise) to the fact that it is not only generally a challenge to get a date, but as time goes by, it gets harder and harder to get a date to the prom. The complexity of all the characters adds interest and depth to this addition to the normally dull prom movie genre. It is rated PG-13, but there are some scenes that are rather inappropriate to the taste of many parents. It seems to me that these scenes could have easily been left out. They really don't fit the otherwise innocent tone of the movie.",1248393600,,885,4.36969696969697
3833608,3,B0021L8UIU,"Bart Got a Room by William H. Macy, Cheryl Hines, was a cute film about a boy coming of age and dealing with peer pressure. I don't think this was a gut laughing film. It was an OK film that had a great cast and a story-line that got lost in  possibly the edit room.

I could not recommend this film to someone unless the price drops down low enough for your budget. Then buy it and laugh a little.",1248393600,,398,3.9625
3833609,4,B0021L8UIU,"Having achieved several ""Best of Fest"" awards at a few film festivals, ""BART GOT A ROOM"" is an independent film that is a semi-biographical film of the teenage life of writer and director Brian Hecker.

Hecker has described himself as a ""pathetic girlfriendless dweeb in South Florida"" but if there is one thing that Hecker is known for, it's his 1998 thesis fillm ""Family Attraction"" (starring Chris Penn and Martin Sheen) whch is one of AFI's highest grossing short film to date.

Having developed scripts for film studios, Hecker returned with a film that showcases his life of trying to find a prom date but using the character Danny Stein (played by Steven Kaplan) as a high school student with raging hormones and just trying to find himself and not be surpassed by the school's uber-nerd, Bart.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""BART GOT A ROOM"" is featured in anamorphic widescreen (1:85:1). Overall cinematography was well done and for a DVD, I didn't see a large amount of digital compression artifacts or high noise.

The film is presented in Dolby Surround 5.1 and for the most part, the film is a dialogue-driven film that focuses on front channel usage.  There is occasional ambiance through crowd scenes that you will hear through the surrounds.  At times, the music seems to overpower the dialogue at times when volumes are low but for the most part, easily adjusted through your receiver.

So, viewers can expect a clean video and audio on DVD.

Subtitles are featured in Spanish or English SDH (Subtitles for Death and Hearing Impaired).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

Aside from the upcoming films on DVD trailers, there is a ""Pop-Up Production Notebook"" which people can re-watch the film and you will see pop-up production notes.

I wished there was audio commentary because it would have been great to hear Brian Hecker talk about the differences between his real-life situation versus what we see on film with the character of Danny.  Also, a featurette on how they accomplished William H. Macy's Jewish fro and interviews with the talent would have been awesome.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""BART GOT A ROOM"" is an interesting teen comedy.  It could have easily went the way of other ""Revenge of the Nerd"" or similar type of films but it didn't and Director Brian Hecker did a good job with showcasing the magnified peer pressure in combination with ranging hormones with the character of Danny.

Where in most films in the past, teens would be warned of not getting in trouble or getting laid but to find a film where parents were easily supportive of their son not to become as low as the school nerd was quite interesting.  Even more fun is watching William H. Macy as Ernie Stein with the `fro and trying to talk openly with his son about women or girls and what to do.

If anything, this is not just about a teenager trying to find a prom date and losing his virginity, there is actually a story behind this film.  How a family has grown out of its comfort zone since a divorce.  Beth Stein (Hines) has a pudgy boyfriend who likes to stroke her thigh in front of her son and then you have Ernie Stein (Macy) who just talks about sexy all the time but yet, his life has not exactly been all that exciting.  And it helps escalate the uncertainty of Danny (Kaplan) about his chances of finding a date.

If anything ""BART GOT A ROOM"" doesn't need to become like any other teen film, nor does it have to incorporate teen sex or promiscuity to have a good story.  The film can easily appeal to the teen and for the adults but for those expecting T&A and not a film about family relationships or friendship, this film may be too tame for you.

Otherwise, ""BART GOT A ROOM"" avoids the typical teenage film cliches and becomes an enjoyably, humorous film on its own.",1248307200,,3748,4.642424242424243
3833610,3,B0021L8UIU,"This movie is basically an autobiography of the writer-director's high school prom experience.  Many of the scenes are taken right from the experiences he had in high school.  Many of the scenes are even shot in the places where he had them.  Sounds like it might be interesting, right?  The only problem is that his prom experience was pretty much like most/many guys prom experiences.  This movie has not only been lived before by millions of people, but has also been put on film in dozens of different movies.  It's not that it's done badly.  In fact, Bill Macy and Cheryl Hines do absolutely fantastic jobs as the parents.  Hines disappeared into her character so well that, at times, I was asking myself, ""Is that really Cheryl Hines?""  The wig she wore had something to do with that, but her acting also was unlike any character I've seen her play before.  She did impress me a lot.  Some of the younger actors also turned in good performances - particularly the guy who learned to play the drums for his part and did a great job of it.  Also, the actress who played Marcie.  She's only in the film for about a minute - but what a minute.  So, in summary - not an original or particularly interesting story, but good performances by some of the actors that are worth watching.  Also, this movie is SHORT - about an hour and a quarter (minus the credits) - not much more than a tv episode.  So, even if you don't like it, you won't have wasted a lot of time by watching it.",1248307200,,1479,4.402214022140221
3833611,5,B0021L8UIU,"Much of ""Bart Got a Room"" is going to feel a bit old hat for some, but you know what? Sometimes it's a good old hat, the kind that you just want to keep around despite knowing exactly where it has been. There is much familiarity in the setup of Brian Hecker's debut feature: poor kid can't get a date to the prom, his parents are divorced, and he has a best friend that thinks it would be funny if they went together. Reading this, at first you would probably think the movie doesn't have much to offer, and would rather spend your money on seeing whatever Kate Hudson or Renee Zellweger are up to this weekend at the box office.

Slowly but surely, this indie gem has something great up its sleeve: the characters develop into three dimensions, the comic devices take us into new, interesting territory and there's an ending that cries so far from what we are led to expect. Not only that, the movie has its references to Blake Edwards and (naturally) Woody Allen, but this is a springboard for a series of funny and crazy events.

Plus it's one of those indie pictures that have some great talent in front of the camera. William H. Macy, Cheryl Hines, Jennifer Tilly and a promising newcomer named Steven J. Kaplan who will no doubt become a star.

The title character is not named Bart (more on that later) but rather Danny (Steven J. Kaplan) who is nice enough, smart enough and -- from a heterosexual writer's perspective, for what it's worth -- good looking enough, but poor Danny just can't get a date to the prom. His friend Camille (Alia Shawkat) wants to go as friendly company and to have a friend to spend time with, but Danny has his eyes on a few other potentials, including a strawberry blonde who he chauffeurs every now and then.

To make matters worse, Danny's dealing with the divorce of his parents Ernie (William H. Macy) and Beth (Cheryl Hines) who both try to stay in Danny's life. It probably also doesn't help matters that they are living in Hollywood, Florida. If any of you saw Larry Clark's film ""Bully"", also set in the same town, you might remember that in this Hollywood, dreams go to die. Or to get replaced by a plastic flamingo sitting next to your swimming pool full of stray golf balls.

At a scant 78 minutes, ""Bart Got a Room"" is funnier, has a great sense of place and time and is more honest than most of the comedy films with ten times the budget. It wears its charm on its sleeve and isn't afraid to make us laugh at moments that are refreshingly honest as well as way out there. In one bizarre sequence that just barely gets away with it, Ernie tests the noise level of his new apartment just in case Danny wants to bring his date ""home"". An old lady in the apartment building appears in the corner of the frame as Ernie tests the volume ""From one to ten"", but the old lady isn't the joke. The joke is that Ernie sure loves his son no matter what.

Consider even a later scene with Ernie, who is so bent on getting Danny a date for the prom that he ditches a date (with a character played by the gorgeous Jennifer Tilly...she's nearing 50, people!), runs halfway across Hollywood and winds up picking an older and slightly oversized prostitute for Danny to take to the big dance. You may not know what you're doing Ernie, but at least your heart is in the right place.

I mention Ernie so much because, ladies and germs, William H. Macy needs no introduction. You already know him, love him and admire his craft as an actor, and I loved his wacky jew-fro, childlike demeanor in his eyes and yet he has a real soft spot for his ex, despite their separation. Macy is matched well by Steven J. Kaplan, simply terrific as the conflicted son. He was carefully selected by Brian Hecker for his natural talent, of course, but when I met Brian at a screening at the Victoria Film Festival screening, there was a divine visual similarity.

Sure, ""Bart Got a Room"" is a great comedy, it's funny with big laughs, but as I wrote about before, things don't exactly happen in the way we think they're going to and it is wonderful, just wonderful on how it does things in an honest manner. The film is not about whether Danny and his best friend get together romantically - nor Danny's parents for that matter -- and I really admired how the film side stepped what could have been a romantic clich and ends on a note of surprising hope for all four of the leads. The end credits roll, and their life continues for the better. And so does ours as we leave the theater.

Note: And that Bart, by the way? He's an illusion, a character we don't see through the whole film, and when we finally do, it's a whammy. And stay for those credits.

3833752,4,B0021L8UIU,"Written and directed by Brian Hecker, ""Bart Got a Room"" is a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age tale set in south Florida where high school geek Danny Stein  won't be in the demographic majority for another fifty years yet.  A good Jewish boy, Danny is all excited about attending his senior prom - or at least he would be if he could get the hot sophomore he drives to school every day to agree to go as his date.  Unfortunately, she thinks of him merely as an older-brother type, so Danny is forced to look elsewhere for options, including the Plain Jane Camille (Alia Shawkat), who`s been his best friend since childhood and obviously wishes Danny felt about her the way she feels about him.  Danny also has to contend with the fact that his soon-to-be-divorced parents (wonderfully played by William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines) are already in the market for future spouses and that they keep the understandably mortified youngster continually posted on their dating progress.

Though in terms of plotting there's little that separates ""Bart Got a Room"" from countless other films in the same genre, the movie finds a wealth of truth and humor in its deadpan depictions of ordinary life.  Bart and all the figures who inhabit his world go through their days just trying to make the best of bad situations, searching for that one little nugget of happiness that will make the crushing banality of the rest of their lives at least tolerable, if not worthwhile.  For Danny, it's getting a date for the prom and meeting an attractive girl who will reciprocate his romantic interest; for his parents, it's trying to get that one last stab at coupled attachment in a world where youth is prized above all else and where they're faced with a daily reminder of what awaits them in their fast-approaching ""golden years;"" for Camille, it's trying to get the boy she's attracted to to see her as a burgeoning woman with sexual appetites and not just a platonic buddy to study and hang out with.

""Bart Got a Room"" nicely captures the exaggerated nature of teenage trauma, when showing up dateless to the prom is a personal tragedy comparable only to the crash of the Hindenburg or the sinking of the Titanic.  And Steve Kaplan perfectly conveys every bit of the angst Danny experiences as he maneuvers his way through those shark-infested waters known as adolescence.",1271462400,,2358,4.802469135802469
3833753,2,B0021L8UIU,"Never laughed once here, not even close. William Macy kind of steals the show as the dad obsessed with finding a girlfriend online. The rest are forgettable.

3833758,4,B0021L8UIU,"""Bart Got a Room"" is a high school comedy that tells the story of nerdy high school senior Danny's (Steven Kaplan) last minute effort to find a date to his high school prom; and the anxiety that surrounds his attempts.  The title is a reference to the character of Bart, who is irrelevant to the story and only significance is that he has a date and a hotel room for prom night, even though he is supposedly even more of a loser than Danny. Although I didn't find anything very exceptional in the film, I did find it laudable that the writer/director Brian Hecker managed to create an entertaining high school comedy that did not revolve around toilet humor, nudity, or focus a large portion of the film on sex.  Danny is not trying to find a prom date so he can lose his virginity, but because he knows this is a right of passage in high school, and that he must find a prom date to avoid graduating as a complete loser.  The concepts presented in the movie are (mostly) realistic and very relatable.  Danny struggles with whether to take a sure thing - his best friend, who will not deliver the desired social status he is looking for, or if he should find someone more attractive and popular.  Danny's decline is visible as the movie progresses and Hecker really creates a sense of compassion among the viewer for his plight.  Another very common theme from the movie occurs when Danny tries to figure out whether the attractive and popular sophomore (Ashley Benson) he drives to school is interested in being his date because she likes him, or if she's using him so she can get invited. Benson did an excellent job of portraying the stereotypical attractive blonde teenager who teases and flirts with guys without even realizing it, then feigns naivety when confronted on it.

As I said, most of the film is fairly believable.  From the trailer, I was sure William Macy's character was going to be over the top and come across as the dad that is ridiculously out of touch with teenagers, as unfortunately portrayed in so many of these films (Eugene Levy in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie-Unrated-Widescreen-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie - Unrated (Widescreen Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;is a classic example). With the exception of two actions that were a bit ridiculous, I found his character to be fairly honest.  Another problem with the film is that Goony newcomer Brandon Hardesty is vastly underutilized in the movie.  It would be nice if his character was portrayed a little more comedically and we got to see some of his Youtube success on the big screen, but he does portray the character as it's meant to be played and does a fine job with it.

As far as the DVD, the transfer is fairly good for a budget film. The picture quality has a little bit of noise but it is not noticeable.  I thought the audio quality was excellent and sounded great in 5.1.

DVD Special Features:

""Pop-up Production Notebook - This is done a lot like VH1's ""Pop-up Video.  Balloons pop-up during the movie with facts about the production.  This is somewhat interesting, but I would have preferred just to have read everything in a few minutes on a single page, like the IMDB trivia section.  Having them integrated into the film didn't add much.

Trailer - The requisite trailer is included, as well as trailers for a bunch of other movies from Anchor Bay Entertainment that I don't care about. In addition, I should mention that two trailers are shown automatically, before the main feature starts.  I absolutely hate when films do this on their DVDs.  I am purchasing this movie, not renting it.  Do not force me to skip through ads for unrelated films before I can see my movie.  I don't care about them.  Put these on our web site or find another way to promote them.

Overall, Bart Got a Room is a slightly above-average film that was enjoyable to watch, but failed to hold my interest very much.  It is a better class of high school comedy, but it's not likely I will recommend it to anyone anytime soon.  It would have been nice to have included a commentary from Hecker, or even better, a commentary that had Brandon Hardesty, who I believe could have really shined on something like that.",1257120000,,4293,4.798913043478261
3833759,1,B0021L8UIU,"William H Macy is the only reason I kept watching this movie to the end. He's brilliant, the only funny part of the movie, and the only character I cared about.

Our main character, Danny, is self-serving and pathetic and I couldn't relate to him at all. The entire movie revolves around him searching for a date to the prom when he could go with his best friend but doesn't want to since he wants to get laid and figures she will not be a willing partner to that for him. He's a creep. At the beginning of the movie we see him pleasing himself to a yearbook picture of a girl he wants to ask out. It's disgusting, and from here on out I saw him as despicable and he waltzed himself into every one of his failures and I was glad for it because he's such a creep.

Plus, the ""message"" at the end was completely contrived. The only honest part of the movie was when Danny's initial crush tells him ""You're deranged.""",1256342400,,914,4.217142857142857

He happens to be the ONLY recognizable face in the whole movie and his deadpan talents are wasted!

The plot involves a young boy who desperately wants to get laid after he goes to his senior prom, and it doesn't look like it's going to happen....even the school nerd seems to be luckier than he is....so he enlists his dad, played by Macy, to try and make it a sure thing that he DOES!

Who cares?

There's none of the earnest zaniness needed to make a plot like this work...NOBODY, not even Macy, seems to have the stuff to spark any real laughs, and you're left wondering what could have spurred Macy to make this turkey.

You basically have your typical Prom/Date movie on a low budget. The general acting wasn't too bad, but there just wasn't much going on during the movie. We found it had just enough going on to keep you watching through the end, but that's about it. It had it's funny moments, but what teen/date movie doesn't?

If you wanted to find something to add to a Netflix queue and ran out of movies to watch, I'd say go for it. Otherwise, there are far more entertaining and interesting movies like this out there.",1253145600,2,738,4.372262773722627
3833852,4,B0021L8UIU,"The cast in this film are wonderful, subtle, and honest in this really fresh take on the teen comedy genre.
Steven Kaplan shines as the awkward, conflicted teenhero , Danny, buckling under the pressure of his oncoming Prom and the enormous status that his culture attaches to it. Rather than allowing him to enjoy an evening of fun with his childhood friend, (Played with both humour and sadness by Alia Shawkat), Danny pursues the dream of landing a hot date to share his pre-booked limo and hotel room.
The frustration of both Kaplan and Shawkat's charaters is palpable as time runs out and their special moment threatens to be ruined by the hype and hormones beseiging Danny.
The real thrill of this film is that it explores friendship and family in a dry and honest way - and does not veer into sentimentalism or romance. William H. Macey and Cheryl Hines are a delight as Danny's dysfunctional parents, creating believably cringe-worthy  situations.
Ashley Benson is pretty, believable and perfect as Danny's dream girl - the ambiguous, teasing friend who turns out to think of him as a brother. It would be great to see more of her.

3833853,3,B0021L8UIU,You have seen it all before one way or another.  Sometimes better; often worse.  This is a good humorous look at that awfully charged teen period.

3833854,4,B0021L8UIU,"""Bart Got A Room"" is not your typical prom movie.  Except for a visual gag or two, there is no gratuitous sex or nudity.  It remains on the tasteful side (99% of the time).  I could see an R rating instead of the PG-13 the movie got based on a couple of scenes.

I would not say this is a ""must see"", rolling on the floor laughing movie, however it is well paced and have some very funny moments.  The movie centers around a teenaged boy, Danny Stein, portrayed by Stephen Kaplan.  Danny is struggling between his options for a prom date.  One option is his life-long friend Camille, played by Alia Shawkat.

William Macy turns in another fine comedic performance in reliable fashion as the divorced father of the boy, grappling with his own dating woes.  His ex-wife is played by Cheryl Hines who fits the bill as Danny's middle-aged, divorced and back on the dating circuit, mom.

Jennifer Tilly has a bit part as one of Macy's dates, but makes the most of her two minutes.  There are a few other roles, most small (the limo driver, some of Macy's dates) which add some very funny moments to the flick.

The storyline carries a lighthearted, yet poignant, look at the boy's dilemma.  This is what sets it apart from the usual prom/high school movie.

As for the movie's namesake, Bart is an interested character - I don't want to say any more and spoil anything.  Pick up a copy of the movie - it's a nice story and there are enough laughs to make it interesting to watch.",1251590400,3,1474,4.407407407407407
3833855,5,B0021L8UIU,"Every once in a great while, a movie comes along with so much energy that you cannot help but smile. ""Bart Got a Room"" is one of those movies.

Released in select theaters earlier this year, the Anchor Bay Entertainment coming-of-age comedy is now available on DVD. It is barely longer than an hour but it is one of the most enjoyable little flicks you will see in 2009. With a supporting cast that includes William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines and a story that anyone who has ever wanted to feel included can appreciate, ""Bart Got a Room"" is a must-see-DVD.

The movie's main character is Danny Stein (Steven Kaplan), a high school student who has not had the best of luck with romantic relationships. He has a couple of female friends - the pretty Alice (Ashley Benson) and the reliable Camille (Alia Shawkat) - but, for the most part, Danny spends a lot of time around the elderly folks in the retirement community in which he resides.

The ""Bart"" in the film's title refers to the biggest loser in school. And, as the title suggests, even he has a room reserved for post-prom celebrations. This has created severe stress on Danny, who has yet to secure a date to the big dance. When Alice shames him for believing their friendship could be anything more than just that, Danny embarks on a desperate search for the right girl.

It is a simple story but told so well in the hands of writer/director Brian Hecker. Perhaps its greatest asset of all is the fact the audience can identify so well with the plot. And, although the movie ends a bit sooner than they would like, Hecker sends the audience a fast-paced journey into the teenage psyche complete with the tenderness required to make it a modern classic.

I cannot overstate the movie's stamina. That is what truly sets ""Bart Got a Room"" apart from other flicks with similar plots. From the moment the opening credits roll to the tune of Benny Goodman's ""Sing, Sing, Sing with a Swing,"" it is clear the movie has a catchy beat to it. This plays into the countdown to prom gimmick as Danny slowly runs out of time to keep up with Bart's social progress. It is not unusual for the character to hop on his bicycle and race down the street in a fit of panic.

Kaplan is perfect as Danny. His desperation oozes through the screen. The only actor who comes close to stealing Kaplan's thunder is Macy, whose character is wiling to abandon his own happiness for that of his son. Macy gives the oddest performance of his cinematic career and pulls off every moment of it.

With so much energy, you might think ""Bart Got a Room"" would run out of steam at some point. But Hecker keeps the fun barreling at you until the very last scene which, by the way, is full of heart. It is a movie that every teenager anticipating a school dance should watch. But why stop there when we have all been in Danny's place at one time or another in our lives. ""Bart Got a Room"" is a rare gem that anyone and everyone will love.",1251417600,3,2953,4.427255985267035

I then had to watch it to see if it was any good, to sort of see if I missed out on anything by not requesting it. Bart Got a Room is a feel-good comedy about the trial and tribulations that one boy must face to secure a date for the prom. It touches on the insecurities and mostly sends a positive message about family and growing up. William H. Macy is delightful to watch as the dad of the main character.",1251158400,,517,4.029126213592233

Kaplan, the challenge is to actually find a prom date.  There are a few moments of humor but for the most part it was painful and entirely relatable.  The cast was great, though Macy was particularly cringeworthy as the embarrassing single father.  Alia Shawkat's role stood out as Camille, the dutiful but smitten best friend.  While this film isn't going to be the one that represents a generation, it's fun and captures the ease of south Florida culture very well.",1251072000,3,623,4.839622641509434
3833858,4,B0021L8UIU,"I was expecting this to be a typical high-school prom type movie, but found it to be more interesting than I expected. The story is mostly viewed from the boy's point of view. I don't want to divulge too much of the plot, but he seems to have a preconceived notion of the perfect prom night planned, but is having trouble finding the perfect date to fulfill this idea...then actually any date at all. There are interesting secondary character development which doesn't seem to be just stuck onto the story (like minor characters sometimes are) but I would have liked to have seen more of them.

It is more low-key (and even a tiny bit slow in places) than many prom-movies. It is not the laugh-a-minute farce-type movie like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sixteen-Candles/dp/B001AEF6BS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sixteen Candles</a>&nbsp;or raunchy-type like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Pie/dp/B000031WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Pie</a>&nbsp;or sweet, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-in-Pink/dp/B00005JKOI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty in Pink</a>&nbsp;but almost a more sedate mixture of the three.

I did like it and felt the main character was interesting and well developed, although I felt as though I didn't know the other people quite as well as I would have liked. The ending was mostly predictable, and just didn't have that triumphant or satisfied feeling to it that it seemed to be reaching for. Worth watching, but probably not going to be major classic.",1250640000,,1832,6.892241379310345
3833859,3,B0021L8UIU,"Movies about teenage maturity and the goal for the perfect date for a prom have been done many, many times before. Director Brian Hecker's ""Bart Got a Room"" follows the usual formulaic approach to an overused premise; the film offers nothing significant and quite honestly, quite insubstantial. However, thanks to Hecker's solid direction and comic book-like approach, the film does have its charm; it has that goofy but has that likeable sensibility. Yes, it may be one of those ""coming of age"" flicks once again...

Danny Stein (nope he's not ""Bart"", Bart is the supposed biggest loser in his school) is a high school senior who is under a lot of pressure when ""prom fever"" sweeps over the entire high school. The pressure of getting dates, limos and hotel rooms are all summed up in ""even Bart got a room"". This bit of info springs Danny (Steven Kaplan) into making a night to remember, even his divorced parents Arnie and Beth (William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines) wouldn't want their son to be outshone by Bart. Danny's been asked to the prom by his childhood friend, Camille (Alia Shawkat) but he has his eyes on hotter, bigger game personified by Alice (Ashley Benson), the knockout cheerleader whom he drives to school everyday. When Alice turns him down, Danny scrambles for a date, without knowing that the best date he could ever have may be right in front of him...

The movie ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" did this story extremely well in the 80's (at least I thought when I was in College) and Hecker's film follows the exact same formula. While that 80's film had a more serious romantic tone, the film's direction does try to overcome its formulaic roots with a very comic-book like approach. The way the film is composed is witty, funny and charming, director Brian Hecker may have the most overused premise in teenage comedy but he does the deed with a great eye for detail and structure. Hecker throws in some jokes in the sidelines and the occasional use of wide framing. The film is quite honest in its execution specifically its messages about sex but it isn't raunchy or dirty; pretty clean in the way it discusses the topic.

It also remembers to expose the parallels between teenage and adult dating; frankly both sides can be `oversexed`. Danny's parents have started dating other people; but it also does prove very easy for them. William H. Macy is absolutely wonderful in his role as Arnie, he just stole the show with his attempts to give advice to his son and most notably in his efforts to find a new woman in his life. It was surprisingly delightful to see Macy sport that weird hairdo, a rusty old Mercedes Benz, and a thinly-walled new apartment. Cheryl Hines is also wonderful as the mom, trying to date a secure suitor; her character embodies that ""cool"" mom. Kaplan reminded me of Biggs in ""American Pie"", mixed in with a low dose of ""Napoleon Dynamite"".

The film does make the use of what it's got quite well. I loved the scenes when Danny becomes enthralled by the lust of his eyes, personified by Alice and later by Camille's sister Brittney (Tyler O`Campo). It shows a bit of its raunchy side but stayed within the confines of just being adorable rather than becoming vulgar. But there was a significant low point in the script that felt a little too tasteless. The scene where Danny is with a Chinese family felt totally unnecessary that I wouldn't surprised if it stirred some flags.

""Bart Got a Room"" may not become a comedy classic, but it is still a good-natured, endearing teen comedy. The film is nicely paced at 79 minutes (including credits) and while it won't make you laugh out loud, you will find yourself snickering a lot of times. Macy and Hines are definitely the film's high points and newcomer Steven Kaplan isn't so bad either. It is a decent comedy for those just looking for a quick laugh.

Recommended! [3 Stars= good but a mixed bag]

Video/Audio: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The film looks very bright with a use of strong colors that gives it a comical tone. It does look very grainy on some scenes. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is good for this type of movie.",1250467200,,4125,4.657967032967033
3833860,5,B0021L8UIU,"""Bart Got a Room"" pulls off a feat that we rarely see in movies anymore -- it's downright hilarious AND has terrific insight into teen life.

The acting is universally inspired with special mention going to Steven Kaplan, who beautifully underplays his role, and, of course, the ever-brilliant William H. Macy. Macy knocks it out of the park every time he's onscreen. Macy's performance, like the rest of the film, earns its laughs not with overblown zaniness, but with amazing subtlety. Watch this movie closely and you'll be rewarded.

The screenplay is solidly entertaining and funny throughout and simultaneously manages to stir genuine emotion without seeming to try. By the end of this comedy, you'll actually CARE about these people. How often does that happen in movies?

The film is directed with great visual flair and comic timing. It was shot in South Florida and, through masterful cinematography and attention to detail, the place just comes to life. The whole thing just has the feel of a labor of love.

Quite simply, this movie great fun to watch. You'll enjoy every minute.",1250467200,,1091,4.978021978021978

Macy and love Cheryl Hines or maybe it's because Brian Hecker  writes a great screenplay or because Steven Kaplan was perfectly cast to play Danny (Brian's alter ego), but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

It's more than a coming of age movie about finding a date for a prom.  The movie shows the angst of a high school senior who is not part of the ""in"" crowd who feels there is something he has to prove by going to the prom with the ""right"" girl, especially since even Bart, the nerdiest kid in school has a date and a ""room"" booked for the ""after prom"".

William H. Macy, as the dad, is funny in every scene as the self absorbed, nerdy, divorced guy who can't get a date hmself yet throws himself into the act of finding a date for his son at the 11th hour even if it means renting a girl who, in fact, charges by the hour.

The humor was dry and whitty, while not laugh out loud like an Apatow flick, it is funny in an understated way. I liked the lack of raunchiness also, I figured it would be a raunchy romp through prom night, but it wasn't at all.  Instead, it was a refreshing look at the anxiety surrounding prom and the dreaded prom night, as well as growing up and coming into ones own.

""Bart Got a Room"" also reminded me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Big-Fat-Greek-Wedding/dp/B00006FMUW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Big Fat Greek Wedding</a>.

3833963,5,B0021L8UIU,"I bought this DVD because I'm a fan of Brandon Hardesty the Youtube comedian, who plays Danny's (Steven Kaplan) best friend.  I was pleasantly surprised after I ordered it from Amazon.com on August 4 and it arrived in the UK on August 11. It's a treat for the fans to see Brandon in the very first shot, - and quite a few scenes with him in, as well.  It's his first big chance to break into movies: I believe he justifies Brian Hecker's casting of him, and gives excellent entertainment into the bargain.

But, fan or not, the big satisfaction of this movie is the hilarious way it's underplayed: very European; very subtle; very funny.  And it takes a lot of skill to do this.  You come away after watching it, feeliing you've been given a real treat.  If you watch the commentary track, the Popup Production Notebook, you can perfectly happily watch it all through again, relishing the real skill and effort that's been put into it.  And the jokes are even funnier: unusual for a light comedy.

So I bought this DVD as a Brandon Hardesty fan, just to see how he fared in his first movie, but frankly expecting the usual gross-out-humour teen movie - when I'm well past my teens and some.  I couldn't have been more wrong about the quality.  It's a good movie, and suitable for all ages from 13 to 93 (it's a PG-13).

Just one possible snag: in the UK you need an all-regions DVD player to watch this one; but these players are increasingly common now, anyway.",1250121600,,1462,4.458646616541353

The big band music soundtrack along with the story line of the parents make this movie very unique. I really had a fun time watching this movie.

Alia Shawkat is not only perfectly cast as Camille, but continues to impress as an actress to watch.  The film bursts with heart and resonates.  A sweet, relatable story that manages to find its own sort of happy ending without inducing vomit, BART GOT A ROOM allows us to laugh at the awkward teen inside all of us and restores our faith in the truth that no matter what happens...we will be okay.

3833967,3,B0021L8UIU,"Early in the movie Bart got a Room, Ashley Benson (who seems to where a cheerleader outfit more often than Hayden Panettiere) gives a monologue about the car that Steven Kaplan is driving her around in is just like Steve, not flashy but dependable. But Benson might as well been talking about the movie which may lack any flashy names but is at best watchable even if it falls flat at time.

Newcomer Kaplan is the lead of the movie despite not named Bart. It is the fact that even Bart got a room for after prom that makes Kaplan's search for a date even urgent. Naturally underclassmen cheerleader Benson is at the top of the list but there are a few other opportunities Kaplan tries, including a blind date, in hopes of not getting stuck with going with his best friend, Alia Shawkat (Arrested Development), because, much like Bart, we wants to get a room and share it with someone and not just to play Scrabble with all night.

Making it harder for Kaplan is that both his recently divorced parents are doing better finding dates. Mom Cheryl Hines (Waitress) has gotten serious and is hoping a question gets asked soon. While dad, William H. Macy (Wild Hogs) has resigned to finding dates in chat rooms (not the kind Chris Hansen trolls, but real adult ones) with mixed result. Bart Got a Room is dependable for a few laughs but is prone to breaking down for short stretches throughout.

The DVD does get bonus points for including a Pop-Up Videos style commentary that is much more entertaining than standard audio commentaries.",1249862400,,1533,4.6286764705882355

Well... this is basically 90 minutes or so of just such pain. Bart, the rather helpless and mostly passive hero of our movie, takes care of the most important details of his prom date - such as getting the tickets and a hotel room, but he forgets to find a date. Or, actually, he doesn't forget - if he only opened his eyes wide enough he would find one but instead he focuses his sights on the more unattainable targets. Actually, one of these targets is so cluelessly evil that you want to smack her. Or him, so you don't have to feel so embarrassed. Although in that case he'd likely feel even more embarrassed.
The only nice thing about this movie was the presence of William H. Macy, who played the father of Bart. The stories of the son and father, in search of the partner, parallel each other very nicely.
I can see why this was straight to DVD movie. I don't know that word of mouth would have sustained it even over one weekend of the release into the theaters.",1249862400,,1152,4.337962962962963
3833969,3,B0021L8UIU,"Hey all,
I know plenty of you out there will really like this movie: it was a quirky, teen comedy about the high school prom: done indie style with a twist...it was neat, entertaining, and sometimes funny, but all in all I, myself, was not a huge fan, and I'll tell you why.  The content, for one: rated PG-13 for 'On appeal for Sexual Content, Thematic Elements and Brief Strong Language'...it had bad language, lots and lots of sexual references, some sexual situations, underage drinking encouraged by parents, inappropriate behavior, a prostitue, some really bad parenting,etc.

It was kind of one of those 'comedy of errors', where things just keep going wrong for nerdy high school senior, Danny, while he is trying to decide who to take to prom: and it all comes back to this...the biggest nerd in school, Bart...'well, Bart's got a room'...in the hotel for after the prom, so Danny wants one too.  And a great date.  To go there with.  It ends up being one of those 'all's well that ends well' type movies, but I just was not a huge fan.

All in all, this coming of age film was quirky and sometimes made me snort (kind of like laughing, but not really), but the sexual & language content and overall random strangeness of it, just made it something I didn't really enjoy all that well: and I like independent films at times.  You may like it, and I am happy for you if you do, but I, myself, have to give it 3 stars: just not that funny, and not worth the time of my life it took to watch it.",1249776000,,1501,4.397111913357401
3833970,1,B0021L8UIU,"I haven't seen every movie ever made, so I can't say definitively that this was the worst, but it must come close.  The main character is not only  milquetoast but a slimy milquetoast, which I actually haven't ever seen presented as the hero, which was disconcerting... is this what a generation thinks makes for a main character worthy of writing a story about?  And the message of the movie, which attempted to make a reason for the film, and was tacked on in a voiceover at the very end (and it was the only voiceover in the entire film) was even more lame.

I wouldn't be so scathing if the movie were just bad, but this movie presented such a horrible outlook on humanity and life it deserves it.  And the film school device of waiting for 'Bart' ended anticlimactically with his appearance.  He is used as a foil for the main character throughout the entire film because this supposedly awful guy got a date... but at least Bart had balls.  He was the hero.

3833971,4,B0021L8UIU,"Danny Stein (Steven Kaplan) is a borderline nerd/average high school senior who's facing a problem that most of us moderate geeks and nerds have faced in high school:  getting a date for the prom.  Initially he plans to ask Alice, the cute and very flirty sophomore he regularly drives home after school.  He goes so far as to turn down his longtime friend, Camille (Alia Shawkat), even though he hasn't asked Alice yet.

When Alice turns him down, Danny's life goes into a tailspin.  Not only do most of his classmates already have dates for the prom, uber-nerd Bart Beeber (Chad Jamian Williams) has even secured a date....and a hotel room.  With limited and ever-decreasing choices in potential prom dates, Danny becomes desperate.  He enlists the help of his quirky but very caring father (William H. Macy) and his good friend, Craig (Brandon Hardesty), in order to get a date.  Their collective attempts (or in Craig's case, giving advice from the swimming pool) bring about quite a bit of hilarity.

The humor in this film is very light.  There are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments, but the story rarely strays from its even pace.  With that said, the humor is well above-average when compared to similar teen movies.

The film also features a wonderful soundtrack.  It's sure to please anybody who enjoys a good horn section.

What lifts this film to a higher level the most is the restrained comedic efforts of the cast.  They never push the envelope too far, but they always keep it at an enjoyable level.  William H. Macy shines as Danny's father, who has turned to the web in order to find his soulmate.  His numerous dates in the film (especially the one with Jennifer Tilly) showcase his talent as a comedic actor.  Cheryl Hines does an excellent job as Danny's mother.  She is also looking for love and might just settle for Bob (Jon Polito), a ""decent enough"" guy who's secure and seems to really like being with Danny and his mom.

Other standouts in the cast include the aforementioned Hardesty, Shawkat, Kate Micucci in a small but funny role, Dinah Manoff and Michael Mantell as Camille's parents and Brittney Winton, one of Danny's potential dates.

I didn't expect much from this film when I started watching it, but I quickly found myself drawn to the characters and the wonderful humor that make up ""Bart Got A Room.""

Anybody who lived through the traumas of high school will completely relate to the honest & real & smart characters in this film... with a moral to the story that will blow you away and leave you thinking about this film for weeks afterwards. I loved this movie so much that I saw it twice in theaters.

Plus, I should also mention that this movie isn't just about prom night -- but it also parallels the struggles between children looking for love, and divorced parents looking for love. So this movie will appeal to teens and adults alike.

William H. Macy is brilliant and hilarious as always... in fact, this may be one of his best roles to date.

In the process he blows off his longtime girl friend and confidant and takes lots of lame advice from his divorced parents and so-called friends.  He races around the whole, short movie trying to make this his biggest, best night of his life.  Will he discover what's really important and stop being a putz?

There are bright spots:  Macy figuring he's hit the jackpot with provocative date prospectus Jennifer Tilly, and Macy performing straight man for a camera smoozing, scene stealing infant in a hoody- I didn't hear a word Macy said.  The movie's so-so, but that baby deserves a Best Supporting Oscar.",1248739200,,948,4.547058823529412
3834048,3,B0021L8UIU,Seen it all before.  But we'll see it all again and this one has a certain quirkiness that endears it to you as it moves along.  The cast is good.  The story is prom night.  The humor is charming rather than nyuk nyuk.  All in all not a bad effort and certainly worth an evening.  Macy has an unerring eye for just the right role and he reigns in his considerable talent and doesn't overpower his castmates.  For an independent effort it is above average and below great.  I give it a seven.  It's got a good beat and you can dance to it.,1248739200,,538,4.096153846153846
3834049,5,B0021L8UIU,"Brian Hecker wrote and directed ""Bart Got A Room,"" which is filmed in his lovely hometown of Hollywood, Florida.  In fact, numerous scenes were shot around locales which were familiar to him as a child.  This film is very autobiographical in that Hecker based it on memories of his senior prom as well as the proms of his friends and relatives.  Watching this film made me think of my own prom and I wished it had turned out as wonderful as it did for Danny Stein (Steven Kaplan).

  ""Bart Got a Room"" is a warmhearted, bittersweet drama of a young man, Danny  who must make numerous decisions concerning his upcoming prom.  The most important decision involves who will be his date.  He's torn between taking someone with whom he can become romantically intimate and his best friend Camille (Alia Shawkat).  In the meantime, his parents' divorce weighs heavily on his mind.  Danny is a good kid.  He yearns to see his parents (perky Cheryl Hines and downtrodden William H. Macy both looking silly in wigs) get back together so they can become a real family.  My heart ached for him.  Danny finds his parents' choice for dates nauseating.  I found them hilarious (especially Jennifer Tilly who has a cameo as a freak).  Hines is looking for a man with good financial assets while Macy, who repulses his dates, is looking for a woman with good ""assets"" of a different kind.  Both of them seem lonely without each other.

  ""Bart Got a Room"" is also an inspirational drama that teaches us to be ourselves.  You can't plan for a special moment to happen.  You have to let it happen on its own, and hope that it lasts forever.  So what if the class dweeb got a room at the prom, Danny got a memory that lasted forever.  He realized what was truly important in life.  It had been staring at him in the face all along.

  The highly talented Stephen Kaplan shines as the adorable Danny.  It is hard to believe that ""Bart Got A Room"" is his first role in a motion picture.  Alia Shawkat is wonderful as Camille.  She starred in another prom movie - ""Prom Wars"" - and the Christmas comedy ""Deck the Halls"" with Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick.

  Anchor Bay Entertainment did a wonderful job with the audio, video and widescreen presentation of 1.85:1; English subtitles have also been provided.  Instead of full-length audio commentary, there is a pop-up production notebook.  During the film, handwritten notes of interest suddenly appear in large bubbles.  Many of them are hilarious and interesting but you must be a fast reader because they quickly disappear.  I learned much about director Brian Hecker from reading them.

  ""Bart Got A Room"" is highly recommended viewing for those who enjoy inspirational comedies such as ""Last Chance Harvey"" and ""Henry Poole Is Here,"" which have also been released by Anchor Bay.  These movies make you laugh at other people's foibles and peculiarities while taking note of your own.  At the end of the film, you will be a better person than you were at the beginning.",1248652800,10,3006,4.67816091954023
3834050,3,B0021L8UIU,"Bart is not the main character in this sweet, funny teen flick but apparently the mere thought of Bart having more fun on Prom Night then our teen lead Danny(a touching and funny Steven Kaplan)is enough to propel kids and adults into action. The pay-off when we finally do meet up with Bart is hilarious. The basic premise is Danny getting a limo, tux and hotel room for the prom to the tune of $600 but there is one thing missing, a date! Everyone is expecting Danny to take his best friend of 8 years Camille(a great Alia Shawkat) but Danny is looking at Prom night as a chance to make it an everlasting memory of sexual conquest which he certainly knows is not going to happen if he takes his best friend. His search for a prom date and eventual revelation is either helped or made more uncertain with his seperated parents help. A hilarious (William H. Macy and Cheryl Hines) bring a bit of class and acting chops to this film that helps lift it up from the ordinary but it never quite makes it next level due to a familiarity with the script and few surprises along the way. I enjoyed this movie and appreciated that it pretty much stayed away from the gross out humor and potty talk that seems to fill movies of this genre these days but still one comes away from this movie with a good feeling and a few laughs but no great belly laughs and a feeling of having seen it all before.",1248566400,,1387,4.297709923664122
3834051,5,B0021L8UIU,"I loved this movie!!  It's funny, endearing, and so relatable to anyone who's idealized their prom and struggled to find the right date.  Or lived through their parents getting divorced and trying to move on with their lives.  So much going on that we can identify with, yet told in a fresh, fun, hilarious way.

This is one of those movies that you can watch more than once, and enjoy it the same every time.  Like when you're flipping channels, and there's a movie on that you've already seen, but you stop what you're doing and just start watching it from the middle.  This is that kind of movie!

Everything about it is unique - the characters are refreshingly real, the dialogue is funny but in a smart way, the big-bad music is fun and inspired, and the setting (Florida retirement area) has such a distinct charm and style that it almost becomes another character in the movie.  I just loved the ""look and feel"" of it.

Overall, it's a really special movie, and I can't imagine anyone not liking it - no matter who or how old you are.  If you don't see it, you'll be missing out - trust me!!!",1248566400,3,1099,4.396039603960396
8349164,3,B0021L8UIU,"Enjoyable film about the run up to long expected prom in Miami, Florida among upper class whites.  Funny at times,  and using to full extent the considerable talents of William H. Macy, Bart Got A Room has some interesting things to say about the precedence of cultural expectations over personal needs.",1450224000,2,303,4.921568627450981
8349165,5,B0021L8UIU,"Director/Writer Brian Hecker's indie breakout film BART GOT A ROOM is sweet and not with so much angst as to become derivative, neurotic or self-absorbed. I like that our protagonist -- Danny -- is nerdy, but not painfully nerdy, just uncomfortably nerdy in an honest way (and it was such a relief the movie wasn't a sell-out, or raunchy like American Pie).

I have long sought finding my own ""WHEN HARRY MET SALLY"" script and while I watched HECKER's film, I kept thinking about Danny's BFF relationship with Camille, her feeling like the consolation prize, and then the bittersweet denouement
(thankfully in HECKER's story, it only took Danny two months to realize she was the one to create the sweet everlasting memory with, instead of Harry taking decades with Sally).

Also, I love the geriatric undertones and subliminal intergenerational disconnect (especially son enduring dad doing the passion sound level test at new beach place and the elderly neighbor coming to welcome him, then silently backing away - watch the movie and you'll understand this!).

Other quick/first impressions & thoughts:
* can feel the anticipation build of being dateless at the prom
* really fun music
* loved the recurring motif of EGRETS
* good/even pacing, story, directing, editing
* terrific casting and cameos
* heartfelt semi-autobiographical nuances
* Danny's journey a joy to watch
* the quirky/cute Danny character felt authentic, not pathetic, nor one-dimensional.
* as always, Macy is a gem, and one of my personal Coen Repertory faves -- Mr Jon Polito -- shines in his cameo, too.

This bittersweet semi auto-biographical story had me at HELLO...

BOTTOM LINE: Director/Writer Brian Hecker shows us he can do great solid work.

I look forward to seeing what other stories he tells to us.

8349167,4,B0021L8UIU,"The movie follows a simple format: High School Senior wants to find a date for the prom, but would like to take a hot girl and not his best friend of several years.

Danny is facing this crisis as well as the breakup of his parents marriage; his mother has re-dated with some success while his father is dating several women and is living in deplorable conditions.  Danny's father is supportive in trying to help his son find a date with hilarious results, and William H. Macy does an excellent job in this role.

I just wish the movie had been a little bit longer as I would have liked to have seen more action at the prom; however, this shouldn't take away from its premise which is the fact that the prom isn't the be all and end all of life, but the end of one chapter and the beginning of another.",1364774400,,802,4.228758169934641

8349171,4,B0021L8UIU,"I don't know what prompted me to rent this in the first place, from the cover you could easily mistake it for a made for TV stinker... so I was pleasantly surprised when I ended up really enjoying it. It's a pretty straight forward teen comedy about an average kid who is trying to find a date for the senior prom. In the midst of this quest are all sorts of complications and plenty of side stories including his wacky parents who are going through a divorce and both trying to find new mates themselves.

What made this movie fun and enjoyable for me is that it was easy to relate to, it was very honest, and despite the movie itself having a pretty clich plot it managed to feel fresh and funny. I think this film successfully draws the line in having some great adult humor but not being overly raunchy (I have nothing against raunchy comedies, in fact I love them most of the time... but it's nice to see a movie be funny without going overboard). I totally recommend this movie if you're in the mood for something on the lighthearted side, this one totally earns my stamp of `hidden gem'. 4/5 stars.",1294272000,,1105,4.364077669902913

Boy is refused by Dream Date and so is left with nobody to take.  ""Bart got a room"" is sort of the running theme, meaning that anybody who is anybody (even Bart) is going.  William Macy is mildly amusing as the divorced father trying to make sense of his newly single life.  Not a bad movie, but not a great one either.",1282780800,,504,4.164948453608248
8349173,5,B0021L8UIU,"Bart is not the main character.  In fact, he is mentioned repeatedly without a face to match the mysterious name practically the whole movie.  Bart is the unlikeliest of people to do... well anything - the uncoolest, the lamest, the dullest.  So when Danny (the main character) falls short at every corner attempting to find the perfect date for the prom, it's his comparison to Bart that propels the story.  With a few months until the prom: Danny wants the perfect date... with a month to go: well a good date... a few days: a date... hours to go: someone with a pulse.

It's one of the oldest stories ever put to the silver screen - boy idealizes girl, boy is denied girl, boy realizes what's under his very nose all along, boy attempts to overcome obstacle... errr something like that.  For all of the innocence in this movie, it never once felt naive.  Well cast, well directed, well written, and overall well made.  This movie is destined to have a cult following.  This movie is cluttered with great characters, odd moments, witty one-liners, and so much more.  This movie will be stuck in my mind for years to come.

Since 2009, I overlooked this film too long by comparing it's case cover to other indie / mini studio / art house comedies - which in the past several years seemed like an overused genre outlet.  This movie is nothing short of a modern classic.
