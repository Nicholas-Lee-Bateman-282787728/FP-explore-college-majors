8180577,4,B000NQ28P6,"I did not know what this DVD would be like.  It does require some knowledge of the history of Wales otherwise it does not make a lot of sense.  I had read just enough to have heard of the subjects.  Seems to be something that schools might like for a section on Wales.  Most Americans will not be interested but if you do have Welsh heritage, it might be interesting.",1374105600,2,367,4.2
8180578,3,B000NQ28P6,"This DVD gives those of us who lack knowledge a series of thumb sketches of the lives and times of numerous Welsh historical figures.  In all about 15 men and women are covered in it.  The DVD is broken into segments based on each person.  I have read some reviews of it on Netflix where it is blasted because it seems like it was made for high school classes.  That well may be -- but it is nevertheless well done, informative and the pronunciation of the Welsh names, the beautiful scenery shown, and the history of these people make it worth the look.",1214092800,7,554,4.349514563106796
