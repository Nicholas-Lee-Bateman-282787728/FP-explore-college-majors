8462191,1,B002EIJ9AI,"This DVD is horrible. The film footage sucks and the other small detail......its not in freaking english. I bought this for my fiance for a stocking stuffer, I might as well have put some coal in there, it would have been more entertaining for her. You will be burning your money by purchasing this. I would strongly suggest to the company that sells this, take this off the market, no one needs to see this garbage. And thanks for your detailed item descrition when I bought this (sarcasm), I warned any buyers out there.....the rest is up to you. I tried to help. THIS DVD SUCKS!",1298073600,8,581,4.490566037735849
