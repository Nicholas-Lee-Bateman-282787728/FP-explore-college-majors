8460382,5,B00578GDLA,"Lucille Ball is the greatest female comedian ever in history. She was very intelligent and a competent business woman but when she was in front of the camera she was superb. Everyone should have this DVD they will laugh so much. She is indeed timeless. It just so happens i have a Biography regarding her life and works right now next to my bed. For anyone who may like to get hold of the book it is called LUCILLE, the life of Lucille Ball by Kathleen Brady. I am sur e it was sourced from Amazon US.
The episodes are just hilarious and laughing is a wonderful emotion.
JUST BUY IT IT YOU WILL NOT REGRET THE TIMELESS COMEDY OF THE VERY ENTERTAINING LUCILLE BALL. IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT FOR WHO EVER HAD TO CHOOSE THE BEST 14. EPISODES SUCH AS THE cHOCALATE fACTORY, THE MAKING OF WINE FROM GRAPES AND THE EPISODE IN WHICH lUCILLE IS ADVERTISING LIVE A MEDICAL SYRUP WHERE SHE BECAME SO DRUNK SHE DID SUCH A BRILLIANT JOB, IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE HOW FANTASTIC SHE IS, A WONDERFUL ACTOR AND COMEDIAN. I HAVE PURCHASED THIS ONE FROM AMAZON US. YOU WILL NOT BE DIS-APPOINTED. IT IS HILLARIOUS AND TIMELESS.",1356220800,,1111,4.424390243902439

8460384,5,B00578GDLA,"It can be hard to pick out the best episodes of I Love Lucy, giving that the show was a cultural phenomenon and a CBS ratings hit during the 1950s, but this DVD did it right. Included are 14 awesome episodes that encompass five hysterically funny seasons.
Episodes include:
""Lucy Does a TV Commercial"" (Season 1)
""Lucy's Italian Movie"" (Season 5)
""Harpo Marx"" (Season 4)
""Job Switching"" (Season
""L.A. At Last"" (Season 4)
""Lucy is Enceinte"" (Season 2)
""The Ballet"" (Season 1)
""Paris At Last"" (Season 5)
""The Freezer"" (Season 1)
""Lucy Gets in Pictures"" (Season 4)
""Lucy Goes to the Hospital"" (Season 2)
""The Great Train Robbery"" (Season 5)
""Lucy Gets a Paris Gown"" (Season 4)
""Bon Voyage"" (Season 5)

Although this DVD includes several memorable episodes, it is quite clear that they left out a few good ones such as ""The Black Wig"" from season 3, ""Lucy and Superman"" from season 6 and ""Lucy Does the Tango"" from Season 6. If you would like all episodes I would suggest get the Box sets that include all episodes from I Love Lucy's CBS run.",1352764800,,1038,4.610810810810811

8460386,5,B00578GDLA,"This DVD took me back to my childhood.  She was a true comedian without all the vulgarity of today.  I can't wait to get more of the ""I Love Lucy"" collection.  You will laugh till it hurts, she is so so funny.",1327536000,2,209,3.9285714285714284
