7813755,5,6301538226,"I wish this movie was on DVD. My daughter was brought up on this movie - and we always have to laugh about whether or not she's been a good girl so I can read to her - from the TV Guide.  Hundreds of laughs if you have no shame.  Characters are lovable and unforgettable - who wouldn't want Theresa as their neighbor?  From absence excuses for school to mama's desire for a peach colored love sofa, the laughs go on and on.",1307577600,3,423,4.072289156626506
