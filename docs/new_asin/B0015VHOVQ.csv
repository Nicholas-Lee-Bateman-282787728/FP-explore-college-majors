3147486,4,B0015VHOVQ,"This is a good workout video and, like the other Jazzercise DVDs, shows you a modified (easy) and advanced routine during the workout. There are three 30-minute workouts, which I was disappointed with because I was hoping for a 60-minute workout, like in class. But each workout has good routines and enough variation to keep your heart pumping. Some routines are repeated from one 30-min workout segment to the next, so it's not like each 30-min routine is totally different from the next. I also wish the music was louder, it's pretty quiet and sometimes hard to keep a beat because the instructor is much louder.

I do like this DVD because I use the 30-min workout before I do my 40-min Ballet Body routine. This would be good for beginners because the workout is short so it won't be too lengthy and difficult. There is always a modified version, so beginners can enjoy it as much as the not-so beginners. :)",1328918400,13,913,4.635802469135802

3147488,4,B0015VHOVQ,This DVD works out good for me because there are 3 different 30 minute classes. They re good workouts and you can switch off so you don't get bored.,1313884800,,148,4.137931034482759
3147489,3,B0015VHOVQ,This tape is not for beginners. It is a great tape for people who know more about it. This is really my fault for not looking ito it more,1303689600,8,137,3.7586206896551726
3147490,4,B0015VHOVQ,"A good workout and the instructors really get your heart rate up there; also giving you the option of low or high impact.  I love Jazzercise and used to go, but since I moved, there have been no classes in the area where I live.",1298764800,6,228,4.066666666666666
3147491,4,B0015VHOVQ,"This DVD is great to use when you can't get to a Jazzercise class because of weather, time-commitments, etc.  The 30 minutes is a workable timeframe and keeps one active.",1297123200,9,170,4.666666666666667
3147492,3,B0015VHOVQ,"I was really torn how to ""star"" this new dvd, as it has several of my favorite routines, featured a rare guy to lead and show in some of the sets, and the gradations of exertions progress well from Workout 1 through 3.

Possibly the things that came to mind, that I'd really like to see in future Jazzercise DVD's, really hit home this time, and influenced the value I purchased vs the value I'd like to be able to purchase.

First, and easy to include in future product, a more descriptive naming of the 3 workouts, rather than just Workout 1, 2, and 3; which would probably force more focus differentiating each workout.

Second, an option to simply have the music play with the video, without instruction, like many of the Dennis Austin DVD's.  Often times it's not only good, but essential, to have the helpful narrative and cuing (as in Jazzercise's Core DVD, 20 min standing workout) but other times, it'd be nice to hear the music more clearly and ""be"" in the moves more cleanly and dance-like.

And third, a further option of piecing segments of each workout into one custom workout, like Chantal Donnelly's Knee DVD; which would make the Jazzercise DVD a terrific home tool to enjoy and use.

But, honestly, despite the great convenience of the DVD's, and their occasional saving grace of filling in when class is not possible, it's even more tough to replace the live class experience, at a time that fits your lifestyle (morning or evening) with a great group of people you've gotten a chance to sweat with ;-) sharing changing sets of routines spiced with a great mix of whatever today's current music is.

Then again, we do want it all ;-)",1283472000,18,1652,4.598639455782313

So needs to be recast....don't waste you money.  I gave it one star only because you have to.  If I could give it -5 stars it would be more informative.",1370908800,,484,4.382022471910112
