8114050,5,B000ESSTJC,I just LOVE this movie! Watched over and over again. The acting is great and esp. the Nazi occupation in Poland was very interesting.,1397779200,,133,4.583333333333333
8114051,5,B000ESSTJC,I had seen one other movie about the life of John Paul the Great which I thought was rather insipid. This one was very appealing though I like my actors to look like the character they portray. I do think he managed to portray the great spirit of JPII.  I think the movie was subtitled or dubbed but I do not remember being distracted by it.,1376784000,,341,4.166666666666667
8114052,3,B000ESSTJC,I looked it over and the DVD was like new with scratches on I bought others that were like new and do not have scatches.,1366588800,,120,3.84
8114053,4,B000ESSTJC,"I enjoyed this production. I am not a Catholic. I originally saw it on television several years ago. It was well acted. It was told in flashbacks. It is a good projection, even though is a bit disjointed. I recommend it.",1203379200,,220,4.390243902439025
8114054,5,B000ESSTJC,"I loved this movie. It was short and compact but bringing down to tears.

True story of a true man, who loved God, his country and all human race

above all. I am proud to be polish and I will never forget his words - Have no fear. Be not afraid.",1167177600,2,246,3.803921568627451
8114055,1,B000ESSTJC,"I don't understand why ABC broadcasted this movie, the only reason I find is that they tried to shadow CBS's own effort to conmemorate the life of John Paul II, but what they got was a cheap, bad performed version.  When I saw it, I thought of it as an insult to the life of this Great Pope and not as a recognition to it. The actors where not up to their standards, it seamed that it was done as quickly as possible. If you really want to learn about the life of JPII or you are a catholic who loved the Pope and want to buy a movie of his life to cherish in the future better get KAROL the man who became Pope or CBS version starting Cary Elwes and John Voight (I don't remember the title) which were done with love and respect.",1148601600,14,730,4.0
8114056,4,B000ESSTJC,"This is a very quick, nitty gritty movie, but it is well acted and if you have no clue about his life, this will certainly fill you in and let you understand just how amazing of a man he was.",1142899200,,191,3.8
8114057,5,B000ESSTJC,I am not quite shure what to say in general about this movie. It was beutifully acted by everyone who was involed. It was really touching movie and this is from someone who is not chatholic. The movie has one flaw and that is it goes way to fast through some of the events in his life. One does not get the total view of the entire circumstance of the particular events which it should at least set up a little better. Though overall this was a wonderful film and unlike most films today can bewatched by the entire family weather your chatholic or not.,1142640000,5,553,4.276190476190476
