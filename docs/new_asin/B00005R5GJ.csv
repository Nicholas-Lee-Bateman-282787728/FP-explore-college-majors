Mary and Dudley's chemistry was perfect for the trials and tribulations of love and its ups and downs and stops and starts. I have watched this movie over and over for many years, lost my VHS tape, and now so happy to have it on dvd.",1411862400,,313,4.508771929824562
1653760,5,B00005R5GJ,"It's hard to imagine anyone not liking this film.  I had it on VHS and now on DVD and have watched and enjoyed it many times!  Mary Steenbergen and Dudley Moore have real on-screen charisma.  My only criticism are the couple of times that Moore lapses into his standard comedy routine.  But then, I can't stand it when Robin Williams, Steve Martin and others do this very thing.  I just fast forward past these two or three instances.  Just a great movie!",1407456000,,455,4.487804878048781

1653763,5,B00005R5GJ,"""Romantic Comedy"" is an old movie that I had taped.  I will still watch it every so often.  The last time I watched it, I thought to check on Amazon to see if it was available as a DVD.  It was and I ordered it.  It's a ""feel good"" movie and I can recommend it.",1267574400,4,261,3.690909090909091
1653764,3,B00005R5GJ,"This film is not as bad as Leonard Maltin claims, in his much-read movie book, but it does lack a lot, beginning with the script.  The film consists of more than two hours of a couple of writers, somehow in love with each other but unable or unwilling to marry, fussing, fighting, and shouting. And in the end, even though their sexual escapade proved less than thrilling, they end in a clinch on a couch.  Happing ending.  The film is not very romantic and certainly isn't funny.  The moral dimensions of the script are wholly secular and consistently depressing. Marriage and children are nothing when compared to sexual urges, booze, and fame.

But there are some good lines in places.  And the acting is superb.  Dudley Moore and Mary Steenburgen are something to behold.  The music is above average, and Arthur Hiller displays his usual excellence as a director.  But even the stars of the film were unable to put life into a lame script that is at least 30 minutes too long.",1165968000,9,980,4.618497109826589

7951931,3,B00005R5GJ,"Dudley Moore and Ms. Steenburgen play their typical roles-- he the pleasant, rich drunk and she the shy, temperamental woman who has talent but can't quite get it all together.  Moore, a successful playwright,  is an a pleasant but loveless marriage.  Ms. Steenburgen's character, a budding playwright is the ""extra thumb"" in Moore's life. It's a pleasant romp.",1461715200,,361,5.189655172413793
