We spent a week in Corolla, North Carolina this summer and toured the wild horse sanctuary.  If you want to learn about the Spanish Mustangs that live there, I'd recommend you take one of the tours that are offered, where you will get to see the horses and learn about them from one of the informative and friendly tour guides.

I found the video, in contrast, to be mostly political and slightly depressing; showing the back and forth between those that wanted a protected area set aside for the horses and those residents that opposed it. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing, even with the narration of Charles Kuralt's familiar voice.  I'm glad the horses got their sanctuary, however, I didn't want to learn about the politics involved, I wanted to learn more about these beautiful creatures.  I guess I'll have to look elsewhere for that information.",1289606400,3,935,4.676829268292683
