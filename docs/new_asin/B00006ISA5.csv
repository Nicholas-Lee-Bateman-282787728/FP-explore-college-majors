I got both not knowing this was the same as Poly Matrix, just a way to swindle people into buying more.  If you have not seen Poly Matrix get this instead, but if you have Poly Matrix, don't waste your money on this.",1042675200,14,382,3.935064935064935
1777461,4,B00006ISA5,"This is an interesting 4 episode series which starts out strong and, unfortunately, ends weak. Basically we have the cop team of Armitage (who turns out to be a ""third"" robot) and her human sidekick Sylibus who are out after a suspect in a string of robot ""murders"". After a very exciting first episode, Armitage and Sylibus go their separate ways only to meet up and work again later as outlaws before the series finale. There are some really exciting parts in the first half of the series, unhappily the last half bogs down with unanswered questions. The conclusion is like a made-for-TV happy ending which disappointed, to say the least. I like this series anyway despite it's weaknesses and suggest that it is worth your time to watch. Armitage is one sexy babe.",1040169600,3,766,4.723880597014926
1777462,5,B00006ISA5,"The original 4 Episodes that Pioneer chopped to make the Armitage III movie.  Unless you found the movie awesome this may be a waste of time for you but for a fan it the ultimate version.  The first epiosde is kept mostly intact in the movie however the later 3 episodes show a lot of extra footage.
Armitage of a cyberpunk anime along the lines of Cyber city in concept (but with no swearing).  A great watch for those who love some action with a bit of drama.
The voices are different, in my humble opinion Armitage's voice is better in the movie however the OVA's have a good enough voice.  The big advantage I found was in Ross her partner, The OVA has such a better voice than the half asleep actor who played Ross in the movie.
In short if you haven't got the movie buy this, if you have and fell in love with it, buy this.",1036713600,,829,4.1625

1777474,5,B00006ISA5,"Sometimes finding the right DVD version of an anime is as important as finding the right anime in the first place.

This is one of those times. I remember watching this anime a long time ago on late at night. On the Action Channel or something like that. I actually watched Dual Matrix, not this. But it inspired me to purchase this DVD. Unfortunately only AFTER I purchased ""Armitage III Poly-Matrix (Geneon Signature Series)."" That's one of those decisions I wish I hadn't made.

The Poly-Matrix Geneon Signature Series DVD is nothing more than a heavily edited, stuttering bare-bones version of the complete OVA featured in this product. The disk I purchased didn't even have Japanese Language as an option, so unfortunately I had to listen to whiny and often unpleasant and emotionally askew English voice acting by the main character.

Thankfully I found this DVD and rectified that mistake. This is a good anime with a compelling story. It may not be one of the greatest, but it's well articulated and pleasant to watch as well. It's an older anime, but just like watching older movies, you can acquire a taste for such things. It's great to watch the emotional articulation of the main character, and see how the story comes together. It's not as powerful or intellectually challenging as, say, Ghost in the Shell. And it doesn't have the depth and scope and impact of Akira. But Armitage III does have a certain character to it that I think every serious anime fan should enjoy. It's a pleasure to see any film or animation where there is a good story. And Artimitage III: The Complete OVA has that, a good story.

Now just make sure you get the OVA or the Complete OVA so you can actually enjoy that story without it being butchered, chopped up, and served to you fast-food style.",1203120000,4,1789,4.687898089171974
1777475,3,B00006ISA5,"I had seen this anime a couple of times in magazines and on previews, and it looked pretty good.  Big cool looking guy, pretty girl, lots of action.  When I watched it it seemed very slow moving and not as action packed as I had hoped.  Also, there is not a lot of character development.  Maybe if it were a series and they had more time to bring the characters to life it would have been better.  Who knows?  I think some people may enjoy this, but it just wasn't for me.",1182643200,2,472,4.076086956521739
1777476,5,B00006ISA5,"I found myself scratching my head while watching Polymatrix.  When I found out that it was a butcher job of a short series, I decided to seek out the original.  Now that the whole thing makes sense, I can give an honest review of the actual anime.

The two main characters are great fun even as they explore the underside of Martian society.  I very much enjoyed the exploration into what makes someone human.

This series is one that I can't reccomend enough.",1181692800,,460,4.493975903614458
1777477,4,B00006ISA5,"Armitage III is an amazing story that takes many of the themes of blade runner and takes them in different directions, the reviews of the story itself are already out there so I'll make this review of the OVA specifically  vs. the movie Poly-matrix. First of all, it's longer, about 80 minutes of footage was cut for the movie across the four episodes, the end result is a series that feels much less rushed and offers a bit more time for character development and further elaboration on certain plot points. There are a few scenes that they added or changed in poly-matrix so if you've seen that don't be surprised if there's something that turns out differently. The biggest difference between the two as far as scenes go is the ending, they both have the same point to get across, but I believe that poly-matrix did it better, just my opinion. Then there's the voice acting, for the movie they got Kiefer Sutherland and Elizabeth berkely to voice the two main characters, and they were fantastic. The OVA unfortunately had to rely on a smaller budget and lesser-known voice actors, who still do a wonderful job, but Kiefer Sutherlands rendition of Ross is, in my opinion, much better than the actor in the OVA. The end result, if you want a more complete, more developed and just overall longer Armitage experience, pick up the OVA, but don't skip the movie just because it's shorter, it is a wonderful experience on its own.",1178755200,4,1428,4.666666666666667
1777478,5,B00006ISA5,"This anime is surprisingly complicated. It opens with a seemingly random act of violence against an android, or ""third"" who is masquerading as a human. Then when a list of these ""thirds"" is released, there is a violent outpouring of anti-robot sentiment on Mars, where the story takes place. This series of episodes is interesting, in that it calls into question what defines humanity. Our main protagonist, Ross Syllabus despises machines due to the fact that one caused the death of his partner, and left him crippled. Naomi Armitage, our female lead, seems to react negatively whenever Ross mentions his dislike for machines. Some of the humans in this series are as bad as the supposed machines they destroy. The question becomes, at what point does a machine become greater than the sum of its parts. One of the thirds asks ""If Humans don't want me, why did they make me?"", this sets up the political undertones for the entire series. Although not directly explained, the seemingly random violence against the thirds is really part of a political power play. If you like good, fast paced action, with stunning animation, watch this series. The soundtrack is appropriate, if a little electronic. The Characters are multi-dimensional and engaging. The political undertones are a little complicated and not directly explained, but if you pay attention, you will be able to piece the whole story together fairly easily. This series is not for children, the violence is about what you would see on an episode of ""24"". I strongly recommend it.",1174176000,,1542,4.98062015503876
1777479,5,B00006ISA5,"Armitage III does owe much to the 1982 live action film. It is difficult to conceive that it would have been made with-out Mr Ridly Scott's master piece's influence.

 The same basic story line runs through the both creations; Cop chasing down rogue androids, falls in love with android and both attempt to define what makes them human.

This said Armitage III has a feel all of its own, with very suble images and subtexts throughout the story to a almost dream-like climax.

In my opinion it would be best to view the anime in the original japanese as, I hasten to add no fault of the translators, a very important subplot is lost in the english dub.

  A very essential anime to have in any collection.",1126310400,,705,4.503937007874016

1777481,5,B00006ISA5,"This is the original work that someone hacked to make the movie ""Armitage III Poly-Matrix"".  If you saw and liked the movie but haven't seen this 4-part OAV series, you will like this.  Just don't expect the dub cast from ""Poly-Matrix"" to be in this one.
As to the story, it won't win any awards but it is good nevertheless.  Those who see ""Blade Runner"" are correct since that classic movie can be called the father of the cyberpunk genre of sci-fi. This is a cyberpunk series and it owes a lot to ""Blade Runner"", but it is not that movie.  ""Armitage III"" is a tale of two cops, Ross and Armitage.  Ross was a cop in Chicago who's partner was killed by a cyborg. As such, he hates cyborgs and other robotic creations, though ironically, he has a robotic leg.  He then transfers to Mars and is partnered with the female Armitage.  No sooner than he arrives then Armitage uncovers a murder at the spaceport.  The murdered victim is a very famous female country singer, but everyone is shocked when it is discovered she is a robot.  While cyborgs and androids are common, robots who look and act exactly like a real human are not supposed to exist.  These are known as ""Type III"" robots.
Many themes are explored in this series.  First are the roles of androids/robots in society.  Normal androids are treated like slaves.  Type III's have a will and are no one's slave.  Also, the roles of men and women in society are explored.  Earth has become a feminist nation and on Mars, men have fled to female androids for companionship. So is it OK for women to be strong, yet still be women (and not try to be like a man)?  Is it OK for a human to love a human-like robot and vice versa?
I love Armitage as she's my favorite type of heroine.  The romance between her and Ross isn't overplayed so don't worry about mush. Yet it is touching just the same.  The art and animation are good.  It didn't start out as good in the first episode, but improves a lot by the time episode 4 rolls around.  The music is rooted in cyberpunk and those who've seen anime titles like ""Bubblegum Crisis Tokyo 2040"" or ""Divergence Eve"" will see the music there is very similar.  There's just a lot of good things about this and after seeing it, I am happy to purchase this title.
Bottom line: Skip the movie ""Armitage III Poly-Matrix"" which is just a hack job of this series and watch this title instead.  If you've already seen the movie and liked it, you'll like this more.",1068768000,23,2449,4.395555555555555
1777482,4,B00006ISA5,"I first saw ""Armitage III: Poly-Matrix"" on the Sci-Fi channel. Immediately I noticed a distinct ""Blade Runner"" influence, but that didn't keep me from enjoying the film. I liked Elizabeth Berkley's and Kiefer Sutherland's (even though Berkley seemed too excitable and Sutherland seemed half asleep). The movie had some moments of confusion, but overall it was far less confusing than ""Akira"" (which is still my favorite anime of all time). I'd also seen the sequel, which I won't go into here. So when I finally bought the OVA on DVD, I was sure I was going to love it. I was right.
First off, the storytelling in the OVA is slightly better (if you couldn't follow the first film, then you must have ADD or dyslexia...it's not that complicated). The additional scenes that were left out of the film version help give a better flow to the action and a better sense of plot. Extra scenes with Pluto/Julian give more to why Armitage actually cared for his character. And we also have a better sense of how D'Anclaude kept popping up. Some scenes are just done differently, like Ross' flashback (which is a lot more violent and I dare say cliched in the OVA) or even D'Anclaude's first fight with Ross in the church. There's better character development in the OVA as well, especially for the smaller parts like the other cops. The dialogue is pretty much intact (a rarity for animes...the English movie version actually holds up pretty well in keeping the dialogue the same), and the music is still awesome. All-in-all, if you liked the movie, the OVA will not disappoint. It's different, but the addition of certain sequences and bits of dialogue do help give a better flow to the story. The scenes that are left out or altered from the movie give the OVA its own feel. The special features on anime DVD's are always a joy, especially for a graphic designer like myself or anybody with an interest in art.
The ""Armitage III"" OVA is a treat for fans of cyberpunk, for fans of sci-fi, for fans of anime, and for fans of Armitage. Buy it! It's well worth it.",1051488000,24,2053,4.627397260273972
1777483,5,B00006ISA5,"Anime science fiction seems endlessly fascinated with the question of the borderline between humans and robots.  The answers are surprisingly complicated as the directors confront us with humans who are little more than sophisticated and psychotic machines, and robots that have the finer emotional constructs that their human counterparts are often lacking.  In this DVD, which collects the original OVA series, we find one of the works that laid the groundwork for a whole genre.
Ross Sylibus has done what many cops do.  Memories too intense he has left earth to become a detective in the Martian Police Department.  His new partner is Naomi Armitage, a wisecracking, independent cop who dresses like a street girl.  Their first assignment is to solve a string of murders where the victims are all beautiful robots.  Special robots that are so close to human that they can become pregnant.  They find a lunatic behind the killings and a web of conspiracy behind the lunatic.
The relationship between Naomi and Ross moves past an argumentative partnership as they discover some of the truths about each other in their struggle to stop a wave of anti-robot sentiment that seems about to overwhelm the Martian colony.  Their feelings for each other tells is what human really means, even if it is clear to the end that few on either world really understand.
Director Hiroyuki Ochi has created a series that owes much to 'Bladerunner,' but avoids being a hackneyed copy for all its borrowing of plot devices.  The aggressive role played by Naomi sets the two films apart, underlying the core humanity of the Type III robots that have been queued up for slaughter when they have outlived their use.  Visually the film work and illustration are deeply satisfying, using a style that is more naturalistic than the anime stylings to which we've become accustomed.  It is difficult to talk about work done in 1994 as 'seminal,' but the OVA and the related film had a great deal of effect on other anime.  Consider this a must see.",1047772800,16,2024,4.903225806451613

This is a cyber punk anime, and for its time was very good but at today's standards its well.. average. If your planing on watching the entire series, which i'd say go for it, it was a decent experience. Either watch ""Armitage 3rd OVA's or Armitage 3rd-Poly Matrix"" DON'T watch both, they are literally exactly the same except the OVAs have an opening and ending credit after every episode. Then after you watch one or the other you can continue the series with the second movie ""Armitage 3rd Dual-Matrix"".

7969523,4,B00006ISA5,"I like the story line very much about robots in the future that help terra form worlds and bear children (If they are Thirds). It starts out a little weak about the ""last country singer"" being killed in the spaceport of Mars who turns out to be a Third. I was puzzled, had most people tired of that music and decided to choose other career paths in life. Our hero, Detective Sylibus has decided to immigrate to Mars and continue his law enforcement career. This is a good action story, fights, and a conspiracy about why the Thirds are being assinated. He doesn't realize until later that his new partner is a Third herself. The graphics are not great but you will ignore that as you follow the story.

7969524,4,B00006ISA5,"Armitage III is an anime about a cop named Ross. He is reassigned to Mars, where androids are a part of everyday life. His partner is little blonde chick with a major attitude. Her name is Armitage. There is a long series of murders involving androids. Androids and their human rights are a major hot topic in the political and social world. Armitage is also appalled by this b/c she happens to be one of the fabled 3rd series androids that have been murdered recently. Ross and Armitage investigate the case and find feelings for each other.

Armitage is a very unique anime. As i mentioned earlier it feels a lot like your watching Blade Runner or maybe Ghost in the Shell. The OVA series is pretty good. If you have seen Poly Matrix it is a more detailed account of that story. I like the OVA better than the movie version. If your considering this anime, I would recommend it.

Before we go any further, Armitage III is not the third in the series it is the first. The III just has to do with the movie's plot. With that being said, I did not enjoy this anime. The story seemed intriguing, but the movie never seemed to pick up. I wouldn't say this is horrible to watch, but I would avoid this if I were you.

Ross Sylibus is a police officer that is being transferred to Mars. A robot killed his partner, and now he finds himself hating the robots. Upon reaching Mars, he witnesses a strange event that has another cop, Armitage, stopping a couple men with a large briefcase. After a firefight, the case drops and a country singing legend is discovered inside. She has been savagely murdered. You soon figure out the country singer is actually a robot. She is apart of a line of robots called the Thirds (hence the name of the series). As time goes on there are many more murders of the Thirds. Ross and Armitage soon learn that an extremist named D'anclaude is behind the murders. Stopping D'anclaude and learning about Armitage's past becomes the main focus of the story from there.

Mars is now a huge society. The population is extremely against robots, and claim they do nothing but hurt the economy. Earth is now a feminist world. The two are trying to establish a relationship, but through watching the movie you learn that the feminist ideals of Earth cause Mars citizens to hate the newer line of robots. Why? I don't want to spoil too much do I?

The story does sound very good. It just doesn't play out so well. Most of the show is very boring. The action scenes are unrealistic and just not fun to watch. So, you have a boring story and horrible action sequences. What is left? The exceptional amount of nudity that really has no purpose. If you are into that sort of thing, you can expect a good bit of it. The rest of us will just wonder why everyone is naked. Even Armitage dresses in hot pants and a bra.

The characters do not have a sense of depth. Armitage has a mystery surrounding her that is revealed in the first episode. Honestly though, you expect it all along. Other than that, you just watch a bunch of boring characters try to save a bunch of robots. They never made you care about these robots at all. They never even make you care about Ross or Armitage. The lack of emotion really kills this anime.

Overall, there was a good story here, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the flaws in this series. This is a four-episode set on one DVD. The extras are only trailers and artwork. I would suggest buying something else. This anime has bad action and bad characters, so there is really no draw here.",1217894400,,2670,4.396761133603239
