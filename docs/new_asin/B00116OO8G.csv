This means they will not play on the standard player that can be purchased in the US.  They must be played on a DVD player that has all region capability.  I was fortunate enough to have such a player, but didn't expect to need it.  DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU HAVE AN ALL REGION PLAYER.",1213574400,2,380,4.208333333333333
