1421457,4,B00005B6NH,"Although I prefer his more mean-spirited and angry 1990-to-present standup comedy, I found this particular collection of early George Carlin HBO specials rather enjoyable. You see him evolve from a somewhat easy-going observer of those strange little moments in life, into a slightly softer version of his lovable mean-spirited & grumpy self as we know him today. Another great thing about experiencing his comedy in the visual medium: his exaggerated pantomimes and wonderfully goofy facial expressions. Carlin's mastery of the physical aspect of standup comedy is the reason I prefer watching his video acts over the sound-only CD releases. I truly believe one can't really appreciate GC's work until he's both seen AND heard the man! Preferably at the same time of course.
Although there's some repeated material throughout George's series of hour-long specials, most notably his `Seven Dirty Words' and `My Experiences With Dogs' routines (which appear in `On Location', `Carlin Again!', and `Carlin at Carnegie'), each time the acts are a bit different. One gets to see how he adapts and refines his works so they have greater depth and impact. By his third go-round with the `Seven Dirty Words' in `Carnegie', he's got a ten-foot-long scroll of inappropriate verbiage that he reads to the audience as the closing credits roll! A list I've memorized, by the way. You know, for the next time I'm invited to a church social...
Aside from the comedy itself, GC's first HBO special was interesting for having a disclaimer about the controversial nature of his `Seven Dirty Words' routine appear in the middle of the show, right before he gets down to business! Nowadays, such controversial material would be run without any fair warning whatsoever!
`CG Again!' features an unusual incident: George gets a bottle of Visine and a joint thrown on stage in the middle of his spiel! If you've ever wondered how good Carlin is at improv, this little moment is a pretty good indication of his skills at making things up as he goes along!
Although I originally considered `Class Clown' to be his weakest effort, it's grown on me since I took another look at it on disc. Maybe it's seein' George dressed up as a nun at the opening teaser that has altered my opinion about this particular entry in the GC HBO Specials series. Or maybe it's the weird between-routine cartoon breaks featuring his infamous News Stories, and bizarre new Sporting Events. Actually, I may never understand the reason for my new-found appreciation of this particular Carlin comedy outing. Besides, it's not like you care anyway.
I didn't care too much for the `Personal Favorites' compilation disc. This is mainly due to the fact that about half of the material is culled from the other shows contained in this set! The other parts'll likely see release on DVD in the near-future, in their uncut full-hour HBO special formats. But, even though I considered the last disc to be somewhat of a dud, it's still a much better value to buy this set than it is to grab each disc separately.
And now, the physical attributes of this set: the GC Collection is a wonderful space-saver. The collection is made up of four discs (`Carnegie' and `Class Clown' are presented on one platter, unlike their sold-singly counterparts), and are all stored in one large snap case that's about the same width as three single-disc snappers. Which is good, `cause I'll definitely need that extra space for the next wave of Carlin video discs, if & when that happens...

1421458,5,B00005B6NH,"Even if you consider yourself a casual fan of George Carlin (Which is highly unusual, either you hate him, or you love him) you will love this set!
I am finally able to throw out, those old worn out VHS tapes for this wonderful DVD set. Sure the picture is not great, and the sound is 2.0 Dolby, but thats all you need for stand-up. This set also goes well with another DVD ""Doin it again/Jammin in New York"" which features some of Carlins newer material. And he is one performer who you can't say wheither or not his new stuff is better than his old stuff or vice versa, his material is timeless. It has always been funny, and always will be funny I imagine.
Now we just need to get the rest of his material on DVD(You are all Diseased, Back in Town ect.).
Get this set! You won't be dissapointed, in fact, if you don't laugh at all, consult your local Doctor or Therapist.",1000684800,4,874,4.2395209580838324
1421459,5,B00005B6NH,"Me and my family rented Carlin at Carnegie a long time ago, and since then had a hard time finding it again. It's great that this show, and the others on this set, have been released again. The bonus disc, Personal Favorites, is similar to another anthology that came out a few years ago - Best Stuff, but with different material. The transition from the George of the 70's to the George of the 90's is interesting. It's sometimes hard to believe he's the same person. Very funny, nonetheless.",1000080000,4,493,4.550561797752809
1421460,4,B00005B6NH,"this set was pretty good, the only thing i didn't like was the last CD. It was kind of a wast of space cuz most of the favs showed were on the other 3 DVD's in the set.
CD's 1,2,3 are all shows and the 4th is the best of george.
but other than that i thought it was worth the money.",999648000,2,282,3.564516129032258
1421461,5,B00005B6NH,"George Carlin is a realist. He finds the facts of life that may offend people but his reasoning all makes sense in a witty way. Weather you are smart or dumb, you will die laughing.",997660800,2,181,4.2
1421462,5,B00005B6NH,George Carlin is one of the best! I highly recomend this set!,987984000,,61,4.166666666666667
1421472,5,B00005B6NH,no one will ever be able to come close to the way george carlin put on a show...alot of people don't realise that he wrote all of his own material and did not use cue cards during his preformances...he memorized every single word.,1365724800,,230,4.372093023255814
1421473,5,B00005B6NH,great loved it would recommend to friends and family a very cleaver man indeed if you had more in new zealand on sky tv more people would see how funny this guy is,1358726400,,163,3.9696969696969697

1421476,5,B00005B6NH,"This is a very interesting set as it shows Carlin's early specials and how he progressed into one of the greatest comics of all time. I would suggest that you buy the other sets too. Some of these shows have a lot of the same material,so it would be wise to watch one from this set and skip to a newer one and mix them up a bit. The collected specials cover 30 years and some are a bit dated now,but his is still a top act!",1182556800,5,423,3.8735632183908044
1421477,3,B00005B6NH,"I was excited by the promise of this set - hell who would not at the prospect of 4 -5 hours of Carlin?
Carlin has wonderful timing and a wicked and wacky grin that precedes anyone of his reflections on the absurdity of the human condition that he delivers with a complete mastery of American idiom.
This is a collection that is hard to ignore for a die-hard fan like me - but suffers from repetition of many of his classic pieces - like ""Words they won""t let you say on TV"" to ""Stuff"" especially since his delivery of his masterworks does not vary greatly from one performance to the other. The editors must have been sleeping.
But if you have the cash, splurge.",1036108800,24,662,4.346774193548387
1421478,3,B00005B6NH,"very funny comedy acts, but flimsy box, bad audio, definately not worth more then 35 dollars",1019433600,15,92,4.8125
1421479,2,B00005B6NH,"Ever since seeing his 90's work I've been a fan, so it was with great hopes that I unpacked this collection. After viewing the first DVD I was thinking that he has really improved since that and hoped for the next discs to be better.
Unfortunately, it turns out that they all contain pretty much the same jokes and even the George Carlin favourites is mostly a rehash of the previous three discs. I have a feeling that this will never leave my bookshelf again. My advice? Stay with the more recent material...",1019174400,13,509,4.483870967741935
1421480,5,B00005B6NH,"This is an excellent collection and goes well with the other George Carlin DVD: ""Double Feature: Jammin' in New York & At it again"". My favorite performace from this box set is ""Carlin on Campus"", it's excellent. ... So, if you consider yourself a Carlin fan then buy this box set immediatly!!!!!!!",1019088000,3,298,4.75
1421481,5,B00005B6NH,"Comedy will never see another George Carlin.  Today's comics seem to be focused on tired old Jerry Seinfeld themes(what's up with vcr's?, what's up with count chocula?).  George can take everything from political issues to bodily functions and make it all hillarious.  This boxed set has a whole bunch of stand ups, and none are the same.  You can laugh at things he said in the 70's and then laugh again at things he said in the 90's.  This DVD is 5 star because nothing is similar.  All the stand ups are different and they are all great.  Buy this if you want a great comedian with a style that will never become tired or boring.  He's great.",1012953600,15,645,4.406779661016949
7937084,3,B00005B6NH,"I've watched the content be fore so I know its gold.  My complaint is that they've taken a Legend and jammed him into in a cheap, cheesy package.  A $50 collection purchased as a gift that looks like a $5 Walmart bargain bin find afterthought.  I'm almost embarrassed to present it, but it's what's on the inside that matters.",1513641600,,326,4.491525423728813
7937085,4,B00005B6NH,"George Carlin is usually terrific. It's hard not to like George Carlin's HBO films even if you saw others before; each is enormous fun. He is truly remarkable. He wrote his own material, which is not only very funny but show a high intelligence, an understanding of our culture that few have. He also rattles off long lists of items, without any paper or other items in front of him, which shows a very high intelligence, Truly amazing and wonderful fun.
This is his first HBO Special. Obviously he grew after this one. It is good, but not very good as the ones that followed. Among much else, he speaks bout language, that he cannot use gutter language, and as a result his remarks, he says, lack an emphasis. (The issue was adjudicated by the courts, and the courts said he can use lots of such language.",1513209600,2,806,4.489795918367347
