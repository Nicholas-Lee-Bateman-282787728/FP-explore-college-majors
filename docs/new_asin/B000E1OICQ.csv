8104342,3,B000E1OICQ,"First, be aware that this was not intended for beginning banjo players but rather as further information / supplementation for people who already know something about 5-string banjo.  Even then, you may wish he'd take it a bit slower and more fully list and explain the chords and rolls, but if you don't mind hitting pause and rewind you can probably fill in the blanks.  Short of being taught by Don Reno himself, which isn't going to happen, you at least get the information from the next closest source here - someone taught by Don, his son Don Wayne Reno.  If you want to add Reno to your picking, buy this for what it has to offer, but also look online for additional explanations of Reno style.",1422230400,,701,4.503937007874016
8104343,3,B000E1OICQ,"Although it is a pleasure to watch Don Wayne Reno play his father's music, this tape suffers from a flaw many Homespun Tapes suffer from: inaccurate tablature.  I am assuming that Don Wayne didn't write the tab himself.  In order to learn anything from this tape, you have to watch the video closely.

Despite this, the playing is impeccable.",1185753600,,342,4.762711864406779
