8267036,3,B0017RYMX6,"Well, I'm giving a star for each of the dancers who stood out for me:

Tanya:  The epitome of the blonde, tan, I Dream of Jeannie Las Vegas Show girl.  She had a fun, energetic and mature dancing style that was mesmerising to watch.
An excellent dancer and true entertainer.  She understands how to connect with her audience, and how to command a stage.

Ahava:  Wow.  I didn't care for her performance at first, but, upon repeated viewings, I came to appreciate the subtle nuances of her style.  She dances with tremendous emotion, grace and femininity, and her muscle control is gorgeous.  Her hands and arms are especially sharp and beautiful.  The quiet power of her dance really drew me in.

Oreet:  I thought her ending drum solo was very good.  She interpreted the drum beats very well.  The earlier part of the performance seemed weird. It looked like she was rushing, and her movements were a bit jerky and tense.  At times, her facial expressions seemed manic and over the top.  When she relaxed and danced inside the music, she was very good.

Everybody else, meh.  I saw steps being danced, but not so much connection to the music.",1277337600,,1143,4.63
8267037,5,B0017RYMX6,"I really enjoy this series.  Vol 3 featured dancers with whom I am largely unfamiliar, so I was especially excited to see them.

The editing is really fantastic and focuses on what I want to see.  Nothing drives me crazy like weird cuts and superimposing images as these obscure the dancing.  This DVD, like the others in the series, shows each dance as the artist dictates.  I can see real actual dancing, not an MTV video.

I'm excited for the next volume!",1230595200,3,458,4.524390243902439
8267038,5,B0017RYMX6,"I like this dvd the best of the three so far.  I especially love Tonya's drum solo performance.  It is a live performance, whereas the first dvd was not.  It is not as good as the IAMED performance dvd's, as IAMED's tend to be twice as long.  However, this is half the price and so I suppose it comes out the same.  I'm glad that Michelle Joyce includes a lot of different dancers in these dvd's.  IAMED's biggest fault is using the same dancers over and over, usually the California dancers whom Susie Evans doesn't have to pay airfair and hotel fees for.  Great job!",1228089600,,568,4.352380952380952
8267039,5,B0017RYMX6,"I have the previous two DVD's in the ""By Dancers for Dancers"" series and have enjoyed them. The third one is equally good. Michelle does a great job producing these. The camera angles are good, the lighting is good and the choice of performers is always enjoyable. The backgrounds are also good and the performers can clearly be seen.

So many performance videos I have show the dancer too far away or cut the lower half of the body off or do a facial close-up right at a point where you want to see the full technique. And some I own have poor sound or lighting quality. Not so with this one or the other two in this series. I can always see what the dancers are doing without struggling with bad camera angles or lighting.

The performers are excellent and I appreciate that care was taken to have a variety of styles on this DVD.

This is a great Bellydance performance DVD in many respects and I look forward to Michelle's next ""By Dancers for Dancers"" DVD!",1212624000,5,961,4.387640449438202
