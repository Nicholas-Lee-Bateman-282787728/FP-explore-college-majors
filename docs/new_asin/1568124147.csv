186997,2,1568124147,This is the first Gin Miller exercise video I have purchased (and will certainly be the last).  It was very diffucult for me to understand Ms. Miller.  The camera moved around too much - it was difficult to follow the moves and I couldn't understand the instructor - not a good purchase - save your money -,1006905600,3,306,4.350877192982456
186998,2,1568124147,"This video is too hard to follow.  The instuctor is more concerned about getting fancy choreography into this workout than actually getting on the step.  I used this video about three times before I said forget it, I'm not enjoying my workout at all!",989193600,5,250,4.659090909090909
186999,5,1568124147,"This is a great video for the advanced stepper!! It took one time to learn the moves, but it never gets boring.  I get a great workout every time and never get tired of it.  I recommend this video to those who have had step experience and are more on the advanced level.  The moves are so fun you can't wait to do it again!!! This is a definite GREAT step aerobic tape, with some awesome dance moves.",984960000,15,400,4.102564102564102
187000,5,1568124147,I love working out with Petra Kolber.  I have two other cardio tapes of hers but wanted something longer than 30 mins.  This tape is perfect.  You get a great cardio workout and before you know it 50 mins is up and you're done.  The steps are complex at first but that is what keeps you interested once you've done it for awhile.  Petra has a great attitude that keeps you going.  If you are just starting out try Reebok Dance Step with Petra or her Sweat Factory with 30 mins of Dance without a step.  They are only 30 mins long and still very interesting.,980985600,12,557,4.19811320754717
187001,5,1568124147,This is a very fun tape.  It can be a bit challenging at first but once you learn the steps I think you can really have fun with it and have a great workout too!  If you like step then you will love this tape!!,979344000,,210,3.6444444444444444
187002,5,1568124147,"This video has a lot of dance moves, it took me six or seven viewings to get them right.  Once I could concentrate less on how to do the moves, this video became one of my favorites.  The moves are vere interesting, so I don't get bored.  Petra Kolber is very easy to listen to, and provides good cueing.  The only equipment you need is a step.  Once you learn the steps, you'll really enjoy dancing to this video!",977961600,7,414,4.189873417721519
187003,5,1568124147,"I often become bored with workout videos after the first time I use them, but not with Step Rhythm & Moves!  If you love to dance, and want more to your workout than boring step aerobics moves, this video is for you!",932169600,4,216,4.142857142857143
187004,5,1568124147,This is by far my favorite step video. Petra's moves are intricate but once you get them down you can have alot of fun! It's a great alternative to the sometimes monotonous basic step patterns. And as with any step  workout you can make it as challenging as YOU want by varying the height of  the step or adding propulsion to the moves. This tape is definitely worth  the little bit of patience it takes to learn the moves!,930787200,3,423,4.329113924050633
187005,5,1568124147,"To say this video moves to fast, is just not true! This video is a great video.  Petra Kobler goes over the steps slowly a number of times before she puts them up to tempo, and it's a lot of fun too! I Love it!  You do  NOT need to have a dance backround to do this video, you just have to be  able to concentrate the first couple times through!",926208000,,345,3.816901408450704
7796876,5,1568124147,"Petra takes stepping from routine to extreme fun.  I do not recommend this for beginners.  Dance steps on top of a stepping platform are not for the inexperienced and/or out-of-shape.  This video is for those with moderate cardio-vascular endurance and experienced with step aerobics.  Petra is a lot of fun, but her cuing leaves something to be desired, so be patient with this tape.  You will have to do it a number of times to really catch-on.  I am a professional in this field and purchased this as a routine to do on my ""rest"" days from high intensity workouts.",1289347200,,567,4.62
7796877,5,1568124147,Petra Kolber is hard but fun!! I have yet to master all of the moves but I'm trying!! I have the Gin Miller videos with a more rigidly athletic choreography but this is dancey to the max!! Think Cathe Friedrich dancey plus here!!,1242259200,,229,4.348837209302325
7796878,1,1568124147,i am very upset with this video it was very hard and annoying and I am an adanced stepper.  Too dancy and pointless!!! Sorry!!  Don't waste your time because I wanted to hurt this tape really bad!,1168732800,,196,4.27027027027027
7796879,5,1568124147,"Petra's shorter Reebok ""Dance Step"" is a great 30 minute work out.  At 50 mins, ""Rhythm & Moves"" is equally fun, and a bit more challenging cardio-wise -- and not only for the additional 20 minutes!  Petra's choreography and cueing are excellent as always.  Step combinations are interesting, and never so difficult that you're discouraged.  A great workout!",1152662400,,358,5.120689655172414
7796880,3,1568124147,I liked this video and the challenging choreography kept me interested for a few times.  It's a good aerobic workout.  I don't really like the dark lighting though--I need bright vibrant energy to make me want to keep doing it.,1074729600,,227,4.65
7796881,5,1568124147,I love this video.  Petra is one of my favorite instructors because she knows how to take a step routine and make it fun.  The video is advanced but her cues are easy to follow and you should be able to pick up the hand gestures after the 2nd time through.  If you are done with the same old routine and ready for an exciting and fun challenge this is a great video to start with.  I own at least 8 Reebok vidoes and this one makes it into my weekly circuit every other week because it is just plain fun to execute her choreography.  Petra incorporates a variety of moves to enhance lower body toning such as kicks and lunges.  It is a great way to raise your heart rate and work out the lower body.,1042934400,9,699,4.065693430656935
7796882,4,1568124147,"Its a good workout but takes alittle while to get the moves down. I think the aerobics part ended too abruptly. It could have had more of a transition from aerobics to cooldown. Otherwise, loved the workout use it almost everyday.",1025222400,4,230,4.634146341463414
7796883,4,1568124147,"I found for myself that after a few times it didn't wear me out AS much. Don't get me wrong--by the end of the tape, you're sweatin'!!!  Great choreography, but it might take a little bit to get the moves down for a newbie to step.  It's an ok tape overall; I use it once every two weeks or so to keep things different.",1019174400,3,319,3.96875
7796884,4,1568124147,"I love this workout!  It's tricky but loads of fun.  I have done Petra Kolber's Dance Step video over a 100 times and really enjoyed it but certainly needed a change, so I bought this title.  Petra is a fantastic instructor--very encouraging and clear.  I particularly like her instruction to use the ""television leg"" for a particular move or to get off the step on the side that faces ""away from the television.""  These types of instructions make the tricky moves much easier.  However, whoever does her camera work thinks it's ""artistic"" to switch the camera to a peculiar angle in the middle of a particularly dancey move.  At one point, Petra says, ""Now watch this,"" and the camera pulls away, so you can no longer see what she's doing.  Still, the workout is great once you get past this oddity.  I look forward to putting it in the VCR and starting my workout in the mornings.",1017878400,3,882,4.56687898089172
