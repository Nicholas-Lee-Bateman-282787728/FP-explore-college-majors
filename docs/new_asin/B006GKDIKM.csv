4987079,4,B006GKDIKM,"My son loves music, and I thought this would be a good way to spark some interest in using the potty.  He loves the video and is already trying to sing along with it.  Whether or not it will help with actually using the potty remains to be seen. The video alternates between Rachel singing and signing, other children signing (really cute!), and animated clips.  It gives simplified explainations of why we need to potty, listening to our bodies, hygine, accidents, and celebrating success.  It's fairly short--about 30 minutes, which is appropriate for the attention span of a toddler, but it does make shelling out the *same amount as a new-release full-length movie* a bit tough to swallow.  I haven't played the CD yet, and while I'm sure it will keep my kids entertained in the car, I didn't really get it for the CD, and would have opted for a DVD only version if it were available.",1341360000,4,888,4.594936708860759
4987080,5,B006GKDIKM,"This has been a great addition to our potty training efforts. The songs are cute (and repetitive) and my kiddo started singing them almost immediately - the next day, he remembered the 'stop and go' song for his potty efforts. The signs are introduced & reviewed very quickly, so I think this is aimed at 1) hearing kids, who 2) who are/near 2yrs+, and who 3) are already familiar w/a few signs. But even so, it's easy to pick up the unfamiliar signs, and the mini video clips of actual kids doing signs/activities is what my child really responds to. A great purchase :)",1336521600,10,571,4.5
4987081,5,B006GKDIKM,"Our daughter has been watching Baby Signing Time for awhile now.  When it came to potty training, I thought she would be more interesting in Elmo's Potty Time since she also loves Elmo (she is 2).  She wasn't - she took to the Baby Signing Time Potty Time videos in a flash and sings the songs all the time.  The video really helped her understand, especially the song that sings ""Stop What Your Doing and Go"" to the potty. We also listen to the CD in the car and she sings every single one of the songs.  I am not saying that this is how they conquer potty training - keeping them in underwear for a weekend and making them go every 10 - 30 minutes to start off with is the way to start your road to potty training.  But this video was fun for her to watch and seemed to help her understand better.  Every child is different, but it is worth a try!  We loved it.",1336348800,,863,4.071005917159764
4987082,2,B006GKDIKM,"My daughter didn't require a biology lesson to understand the basic steps of using the bathroom.  This DVD spent at least 2/3 of the run time discussing such topics as ""needing help"", ""understanding your body"", ""eating"", ""drinking"", and proper handwashing.  There was very little discussion about what is actually supposed to happen when a child goes to the toilet.  Yes, I agree, it's important to teach children to ""listen to their bodies"" and how to wash hands and so forth.  There is a good song more than halfway through that does discuss the steps in using the potty: ""Potty, wipe, flush, and wash"".  It's quite catchy, but it's not enough. My daughter isn't old enough to really understand that food that is eaten and then expelled.  She needed to understand in basic terms that the toilet is where pee pee and potty go.

She was thoroughly entertained by the songs and it held her attention.  But listening to a song for several minutes about washing hands for 20 seconds...not what I was looking for.  My daughter has developmental delays and has responded to other signing time videos, which is why I purchased this one.  There was some good information about keeping your underwear clean and ""stop what you're doing and GO!"" to demonstrate that children need to use the potty when it's time.  But the mechanics of it - I am, of course able to teach this in person, but we were looking for something that provided more basic modeling techniques and this didn't have it.  For the price we paid, I'm disappointed.  If you are in love with Signing Time, you'll probably enjoy this video...otherwise, skip it.",1332374400,14,1615,4.766187050359712
4987083,5,B006GKDIKM,"We have sincerely enjoyed the entire Signing Time Series, and we have most of the Volumes, including Potty Time.  Our little boy appears to be quite captivated with all of the Signing Time videos (which is helpful when you're alone and you need to do some chores before the wife gets home).  He definitely responds better and appears to absorb more then other educational videos that we have played in the past (i.e. better than Your Baby Can Read & Baby Einstein).  This may be an advanced topic for our 18 month old, but hopefully he's understanding a little bit more every day.  Yes, the repetition is just enough to get the point across, but not enough to make you lose your mind.  The songs are pretty catchy, and I find myself inadvertently singing them at work.  The animation and editing are professional grade for this ~40 minute video.  I've noticed that it's hard NOT to watch.  Even though I've seen it at least 100 times, it's still captivating for me, because I notice something different about the scenes every time.  The accompanying CD was not as impressive, and we ""donated"" it to our son's daycare.",1330646400,7,1117,4.658163265306122
4987084,5,B006GKDIKM,"I was hoping that Signing Time would make this dvd for my older two children, but it has come out in perfect time for my youngest and most stubborn!  My three year old is just not motivated to potty train, but has started to become more open to the idea after watching the Potty Time DVD.  He watches it once in the morning and listens to the CD at naptime and bedtime.  When it is time to go to the bathroom, he is so proud of himself and ""wants me to tell Rachel"" that he is doing a good job.  The songs on this dvd are just what you expect from Signing Time (upbeat, catchy, to the point).  The concepts are clear with great repetition.  I have already purchased this dvd for three family members with little ones in diapers. I highly recommend this dvd for potty training!

My son is hearing but took to the first Baby Signing Time DVD so well that I thought that it couldn't hurt to watch this one. He can sign ""potty"" ""wash"" ""soap"" ""flush"" and so many more! He loves to wash his hands now and can tell me. After him starting to watch it from 1.5 years, I believe he will be ready to do the 3-day training method in a month when he's 2. I believe he will understand and be excited to do it like his is with washing his hands!

4987098,5,B006GKDIKM,"Tried potty training my two-year old from the day of her second birthday, off and on, for five months and had no success. She hated the feel of pullups, and wouldn't do anything on her toddler potty other than sit on it and mimic the processes of using the bathroom, but never actually using it. Then a friend recommended this DVD and we bough it. I played it all day long while keeping my toddler naked. I pulled a small table over to her little potty so she could eat lunch and snacks while sitting on her little potty and watching the DVD. She loved the ""potty lady"" and sang along. The real-life children really captured her attention, much more than others that used animation. She had no accidents that whole day (owed partly to the fact that she physically was sitting on the potty most of the day because she loved the DVD, but you take it where you can get it). Huge strides to potty training, and after a few days she even let me put pull-ups on her without a fight.",1470614400,,976,4.309782608695652

She is already a huge fan of Signing Times, so after reading the reviews of Potty Time, I bought it.  After watching it a few times, the accidents completely stopped and she started asking for the ""potty"" at home.

4987118,5,B006GKDIKM,"Geared more toward Typical children - but STICK WITH IT for your kid with delays

At first I admit that I was a little disappointed.  The pace is not as slow and deliberate as the Signing Time video series.  It rolls right along.  But if your kid has delays STICK WITH IT, she'll get it!  My girl absolutely adores this video.  It quickly became her number one favorite and I have to limit her watching it, actually, or she'd watch it 3 or more times in a row every single day!

She was age 5.5 when it was introduced.  She has Down Syndrome and though quite bright, was more like a 3 or 3.5 year old in a lot of ways.  At the time, she had been out of nighttime and daytime diapers for months but still had a LOT of accidents (very rare to be dry a whole day.... sometimes had a few accidents daily).  So she seemed to have reached a plateau.  I was getting very despondent.

But after a few days, maybe a week, we saw a  big improvement in her self- pottying skills. After a couple weeks, she was totally dry in the daytimes.  She really responded to the songs, the reinforcement, the Self Talk.  The ""Stop What You're Doing, Stop and GO!"" song has been especially helpful in our situation!  She gets practice speaking new words, too.  I never even tried to introduce the word ""Accident"" , but she can say it, and a whole lot of other things from the video, very clearly now!",1419897600,,1377,4.234615384615385
4987119,2,B006GKDIKM,"I love Rachel's Signing Time series, but this DVD is disappointing in a number of ways. Not once does anyone actually sit on ""the potty"" on this DVD, except for the cover image. At a minimum, they could have had Hopkins the Frog use the potty in an animated sequence. The ""My Body is Amazing"" song doesn't feature a verse on ""going potty"" either, if memory serves. So the entire DVD seems to talk around the actual act of eliminating while using the toilet or a plastic potty. I will look around for other DVD's.",1411776000,,512,4.4

4987122,1,B006GKDIKM,"I'm rarely disappointed with my Amazon purchases, especially those based on fellow customer reviews.  I had high hopes because of the multiple positive reviews. However, this DVD floored me with how bad it was. The cover shows animation, but the DVD is not fully animated, not even mostly animated. The narrator (who is frequently featured), over-does her facial expressions to an extreme and the songs are not catchy at all. I thought the signing element would be interesting for my toddler while he potty trains (he knows some basic signs), but the whole production is so distracting that it just overloads him. He loves most toddler-type songs and jingles, but he won't sit through any of these songs.  When I play this DVD, he literally gets up off his potty seat, says, ""No, no, no, no"" and leaves the room.  NOT a good response for potty training. I should have saved myself the money and stuck with Daniel Tiger's potty training episode and some random clips I found on YouTube.",1408665600,,985,4.7823529411764705

4987126,5,B006GKDIKM,"It's a great thing that. I got this DVD for my kids.  Even though you teach them and try to make them listen, may not be enough.  Sometimes kids like to listen better to other people than their own parents.  One thing when training your kids is to never give in to going back to diapers or pull ups, and to never yell or get upset.  They are as scared as you are because of the big changes they are going through.  My kid learned within a few days and got it down with no wetting in the bed.  Once in a while after a week may have a slip up a few straight days during the day time, not telling you can be frustrating , still no wetting at night though, but that's okay, keep encouraging your child!",1394582400,,698,3.985611510791367

After the first week of watching the viedo a few times one day after watching Mommy and Grandma go pee in the toilet she started pulling on her diaper so we pulled it off and sat her on the toilet. After a few minutes of concentration she went pee on her own.

Still, this was more vocabulary for him, and someday it may sink in.  :)",1365206400,,396,4.012820512820513

The DVD teaches a procedure of going potty: potty, wipe, flush, wash. We hear her repeating this all the time just for fun! Potty time makes learning how to potty fun for toddlers.

She teaches sign language, talks about how wonderful it is to grow, and listen to your body. We watched this everyday for a week, and used the timer on the potty watch to signal potty time. This way, it left big ole bad mom out of the picture. Happily, my daughter has been using the toilet on her own for the past two days.",1363132800,,482,4.138297872340425

4987146,4,B006GKDIKM,"Like the other Baby Signing Time videos, this one is a winner for my daughter. However, I'm a bit disappointed with it.  I assumed it would be mainly about pottying and potty training, it really isn't.",1357689600,,201,4.583333333333333

4987148,5,B006GKDIKM,"My daughter is 2 and a half now and was ready to start potty training. Since she loves music (and dancing) we got this DVD. The routine was...wake up, sit on her potty chair in front of the DVD while drinking juice and eating waffles or crackers until she produced pee. This started the day off with a success! She was so proud of herself. Once we learned the songs, we sang them through the day together. It created a happy, light, non-pressure environment. I like the clips of families hugging and encouraging their children on the DVD. The music CD is a good bonus also. My daughter did not like the watch, but that is fine.",1356566400,,627,4.367521367521367
4987150,5,B006GKDIKM,"My 26-month old niece has shown little to no interest in potty training until now, and my 14-month old daughter has loved this DVD since we brought it home.  I bought it purely because we have had success with other Signing Time DVDs and teaching her ASL (which is another topic entirely, but I believe it has enhanced her verbal skills also... she already says/understands over 135 words and signs a good portion of those).  Back to topic, both girls are completely ""into"" all the songs.  My daughter now (almost every day) says ""body amazing"".  She often signs (and says) ""potty"" when she needs to go.  She is still very young, but has said, ""potty, potty, wipe, wipe, wash your hands"".  I'm thoroughly impressed.  It covers all the aspects, including ""stop what you're doing and go to the potty"", accidents (great song), and celebrating a job well done.  I think it may still take a few weeks for my daughter to tell me every time, but she is so proud of herself.  She has already pooped, peed and yes, farted into the toilet.  It will take some practice, but that we can do!

I also recommend the magnetic toilet seat (Mayfair 83EC 000 NextStep Built-in Potty Toilet Seat) as opposed to separate seats.  They are perfect for little bums, and you don't have to clean them out, obviously.

One thing I am dissapointed about, is I would love to see Signing Time Potty Time stickers and printable chart.  I went to their website SigningTime.com and there is no such product available.  The silly part is that they show these ""products"" in the DVD as part of rewarding Hopkins (their animated frog) for going potty, so they already have the perfect design.

All in all I am thrilled with the DVD.  I have yet to try the CD in the car, but I'm pretty sure it will be well-received.

EDIT:  We have listened to the CD in the car, and it's been good.  They have two tracks for every song, one with lyrics and one without.",1355356800,,1917,4.501449275362319

8497646,5,B006GKDIKM,"I can't tell you how much my family just loves anything from Signing Time and Rachel Coleman! My 14-month-old daughter has almost learned all the signs from Baby Signing Time DVDs 1-4 and I thought it would be fun to introduce her to Potty TIme because she is becoming more aware of her bodily functions. After showing this to her twice, she actually will grab at her diaper and sometimes sign potty right before she goes (she learned potty from the first Baby Signing TIme dvd).

I read some bad reviews about this product because parents were upset that this DVD did not teach their child to use the bathroom, or that it doesn't tell you what actually happens when you are on the toilet. Well, this is not supposed to do that anyway. It's just an additional tool to help your child become more aware of what their body is doing and helpful steps through songs.

They have a song to tell your child that their body is amazing with what it can do, like for example, it tells you when to eat, drink, sleep, wake up, etc. Another song helps with the steps to remember when your child goes potty ""Potty, Wipe, flush, wash"" which is so catchy and easy to remember. There's a wash hands song, just like in Baby Signing Time 1. There is even a song about when you have an accident and talks about how it's ok when it happens and just try better next time.

There are bonus features just for the parents like how to sign poop and pee, hilarious outtakes during filming, sign review, etc.

I highly recommend you grab yourself a copy of this dvd!",1529193600,,1538,4.385964912280702

His teachers at daycare started to notice his signs, curious, asking my husband and I what certain hand motions meant. Turns out he was letting them know he had to go potty for two straight weeks and they didn't even know it.
