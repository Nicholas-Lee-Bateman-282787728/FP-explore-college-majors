7944748,3,B00005M2D8,"THE WORLD OF CATS is three 30-minute episodes of ""Safari,"" a shot-on-video nature television program hosted by John Ross.  The programs were produced 1998-1999.

 The first episode is titled ""African Cats,"" in particular the lion and leopard.  The second episode is titled ""Mountain Lion,"" and is about the large North American cat.  The third episode is ""Sumatran Tiger.""

 Per usual in nature shows on predators high on the food chain, most of the time is devoted to stalking, pouncing, killing and eating.  Ross provides the voice-over narration and appears in a couple of cut shots per episode, prowling about the tall grass, binoculars in hand.

 The photography is uniformly good, although about half the Sumatra show deals with gibbons and other leaf eaters.  Perhaps because of the elusive and solitary nature of the Sumatran tiger.  The only ""drama"" in this disc occurs when three gray wolves steal a deer kill from a cougar.  Otherwise it's pretty much stalk and eat.

  Harmless and a little educational.",1096588800,9,1015,5.0606060606060606
