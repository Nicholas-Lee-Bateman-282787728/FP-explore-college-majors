4254098,5,B0043988K8,"Kaleido Star is an anime series that sets its own rules from the start and then proceeds to use those rules to tell a coming of age story in a dramatic fashion.  Season 2 starts with Sora now the leading performer at the Kaleido Stage, but for some reason the owner brings in a male lead who is emotionless and harsh to her, and then finds a former ice-skater who comes to the stage with the sole purpose of becoming the star and pushing Sora aside.

The series features a number of interesting ""cirque de soleil"" style acrobatic shows, although with the laws of physics cheerfully suspended.  Sora and her compatriots on the stage perform trapeze acts that require one to stay in the air for nearly unlimited amounts of time.  It's fun to watch, but any adult watching with young children will definitely want to remind them that this is not real life.

The animation itself is not the most technically advanced.  There are no glaring mistakes, but the artists knew the story was the most important and did not try to overshadow.

This is not a series if you want a lot of violence, mecha, fighting or romance.  It's a coming of age story as Sora overcomes a number of barriers, both within herself and thrown in her way by others as she grows as a star.  I recommend this highly.",1323993600,2,1281,4.463519313304721

4254136,3,B0043988K8,"I read the description of this series, and some of the reviews, and thought it looked like an interesting plot. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this for adults. It is a kids series. I bought both seasons, and could only finish 6 episodes of the first season. Each episode is pretty much a standalone episode, and the plots are very simplistic. I didn't hate it, it just couldn't hold my interest. But if you have kids, I think it would be a great series for them to watch. There are good moral stories, and the characters are likeable.",1372896000,,536,4.536082474226804
4254137,5,B0043988K8,"After watching season 1 of ""Kaleido Star"" before, I was both intrigued and hesitant to try Season 2.  The reason was because Season 1 ended so well and so powerfully complete that I was afraid that a Season 2 would wreck the vibe I had with the show.  But finally, the personal need for completion, plus many of the positive reviews convinced me to give it a go.  What I can say is this: After season 1, I had no clue how they could ever bring more to the show and step it up...BUT WELL, they did with new challenges, amazing character development that greatly expands on the characters from season 1, and a finale that surpasses Season 1's ""Legendary Maneuver"" in both ""magic"" and emotion.  There were even new life lessons to learn.  ""Kaleido Star"" season 2 is much more than a worthy extension of the series...it is a true completion of the entire storyline.

CONTENT ISSUES FOR PARENTS:
There is nothing to really worry about in this series, and specifically this season (since this is the specific one we are addressing).  No fan service, no gravure, no provocative visuals, nor coarse language...totally clean (that was easy enough haha).

MOVING ON:

Where to begin, where to begin...By now, I'm sure you are fairly acquainted with the plot by looking through the synopsis and various other reviews.  So I won't cover those kind of things.  Instead, I'll mention what I found fascinating about this 2nd season.  Season 1 dealt mainly with ""rising to the top"".  But now that she's ""made it"", the 25 episodes of season 2 raises the question of ""where do we go from here?"" and ""what is a true star?""  I'm sure most of us have become top dog in various things, and I'm sure we've all wondered ""is this all there is?"" once we got there.  It is exactly that question (amongst many smaller questions that are a part of it) which Sora must struggle with, now.

Plot (absolutely no spoilers)-
The show is very well paced.  I did not feel like any moment was ever wasted.  Even what could be remotely considered ""fillers"" were good and huge character development opportunities.  However, unlike season 1 where we had a good balance of up and down moments, be prepared for a very emotional straining first  half with only a few light moments mixed in.  But still, it was very good and very well done.  Even though it was more ""depressing"" and more so an emotional struggle than in Season 1, the progression was always moving upward to positive light.  And, again, we still get some lighter moments even during those darker times.  Oh, there was a decent amount of subtle plot twists and unexpected directions to the story...they weren't complete surprises, but they were definitely routes that aren't often taken in these kinds of dramas.  And I shall mention this again...it closes phenomenally well and makes you want to give a standing ovation.

Characters -
I didn't think they could really improve  on an already gifted set of characters, but in season 2 they really expanded their depth.  It is true that a lot of the drama and ""action"" centers around Sora's own struggles and challenges.  But we are also given the opportunity to watch the other characters evolve as well.  In fact, a few characters take a step forward and become more prominent this time around.  Yuri, in particular, is an amazingly deep character this time around...and Layla becomes even more fascinating.  Suffice it to say, the characters continue to grow, develop, and expand their roles.  It's really a treat to see them moving forward along with Sora.  Also, I should add that the characters are still very realistic and natural characters.  You could very well meet them on the street so to speak.  We can really connect with the characters and sympathize with many of their own pains and joys.

Themes -
One thing I generally love about the ""Kaleido Star"" series is it's serious and realistic wrestling with real issues that many in the performing arts deal with...and it's that realism that helps many connect with this show.  Season 2 is no exception.  Some old themes and questions from season 1 are recast in a new light and perspective, while brand new issues are raised and examined.  And each theme is executed very well and believably so.  There are so many themes that are covered that I won't even bother trying to mention them...but I will say, they are the very same things I've had to deal with.

English dub versus Japanese dub w/subtitles -
When it comes to the Dub/Sub debate, I'm very neutral.  I have many shows where I prefer the English Dub and many shows where I prefer the Japanese Dub.  In the case of ""Kaleido Star"", I'd have to say, both the Japanese cast and the English cast did splendidly on voicing the show.  But, for some reason, I feel more at home with the English Dub in this case.  I know it's just preference, but that's how I feel.  The casting for the English VAs were perfect and their execution was very well executed in my opinion. And having French characters, Russian characters, British characters, etc. in the show...hearing the respective accents added more definition and depth to each character.  Also, I guess it was helped by the fact that most of ""Kaleido Star"" does take place in the United States...so hearing English was definitely a very good fit.

Note on the OVAs -
In case you may not be familiar with what an OVA is, they are ""episodes"" that were not part of the original broadcasting, but were instead sent straight to dvd/video.  In this set, you have the two ""Kaleido Star"" OVAs which are quite a bit longer than the normal episodes.  They are wonderful additions, that expand on the characters and go into their backgrounds in even more depth.  You can find them in the ""extras"" section of the 4th Disc.

Special Features -
Besides the OVAs in the 4th disc, there are episode commentaries (on each disc), Textless opening/closer, ""A day with Kaleido Star Serena Varghese"" which is basically a video following Serena Varghese (the voice of Rosetta) for a day, and Trailers

ALL IN ALL:
""Kaleido Star"" is a wonderful and encouraging series that tackles tough questions with courage and tenacity.  It captures the magic and wonder of performing, while being very real with the life issues that do occur in that field.  There are many elements and themes that anyone can draw from...but for the performing artist, it especially takes on a whole new dimension.  A wonderful drama with relatable and growing characters...it has an amazingly fun and emotionally moving, multi-faceted storyline.  If you are a performer or have an interest in the performer's lifestyle, this is definitely worth a look.  And even if you don't, it'd be a joy for you, too :-)  So where do we go when we make it to the top?  Many of us have reached a higher plain of performance through struggling with that question...and Sora and the rest of the Kaleido Star cast are a powerful reminder of what victory over that question can be like.",1366934400,,6954,4.697520661157025
4254138,4,B0043988K8,"After Layla and Yuri have left Kaleido Stage, there are some openings in the troupe. Unfortunately, they have been filled with a couple of insufferable jerks. There is a new male lead with a god complex, named Leon. He is constantly degrading the other performers, and causing them to get hurt. The other is a Chinese girl named Mei. Mei is a loudmouth that is constantly challenging Sora, and telling her that she wasn't worthy to be Layla's partner. Sora's new competition makes her lose her way, and challenges her to become a greater performer than she has ever been. Sora will need the help of her friends to achieve her dreams. One would think that the legendary great maneuver was the pinnacle of acrobatics, but it was only a stepping stone for Sora on her way to becoming a true Kaleido Star.

This season picks up a short while after season 1 ends. The first 2 episodes are just a recap of season 1. You can start at episode 3 if you really don't want to watch a recap. The series is still as much fun as it was in the 1st half. I only have 1 complaint. The relationship between Sora and Ken doesn't develop at all. I was hoping that season 2 would take care of that, but it doesn't. I guess that they didn't think that was necessary for a show like this. The show has a TV-14 rating, but I don't think that is even close. I think it's suitable for 8 and up. There is a scene where Fool tries to grope Sora, but he gets shot down. It's good clean fun for everyone.

Another thing that I don't understand is why they dubbed one OVA episode and not the other. OVA 1 is about Rosette becoming a star as well. OVA 2 is about Layla. OVA 2 is only in Japanese. This series is really good. It lacks a few minor things that keep me from giving it 5 stars. It could have been much better if the Sora and Ken relationship was developed. That extra amount of drama would have helped a whole lot. But Kaleido Star is still very entertaining just the way it is.",1360972800,3,1958,4.232620320855615

8414341,5,B0043988K8,"I found this by watching the trailers on another DVD. I really enjoyed it and stayed up past my bedtime a few times to watch just one more episode before bed. It's beautiful to watch the dubbed voices are well-suited to their characters. Now that I've finished the series I find myself thinking back on it and savoring it in my mind.

The OVAs are also good--they aren't always.

My only regret is I wish there was more to see!",1484352000,,427,4.325
