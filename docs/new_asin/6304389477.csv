854823,2,6304389477,"...because if you are and your time is of utterly no value to you than this is the film for you.  I found this film to be extremely boring.  I fast forwarded through almost half of it.  The fight scenes were horribly choreographed (even with Jackie).  Bottom line this movie SUCKS!!! Even if you are the biggest Jackie Chan fan in the world you will have to agree this movie is a waste of time.  I am sure this movie's original title was nothing to the affect of ""Rumble in Hong Kong"" and this is just another marketing ploy to get people to buy some crap-o film that Jackie was in a looooong time ago.  On a positive note, I did enjoy the movie's soundtrack.",1130198400,5,659,4.232
854824,1,6304389477,"I love all Jackie Chan movies except this one. This movie is an old fart.  All the punches and kicks sound alike, it had no story, Jackie has a big mole on his face he's a villain and someone talked over his voice. HOW DUMB don't waste your Christmas present on this like I did get Rumble in the Bronx.",1085788800,2,302,4.033333333333333
854825,1,6304389477,Don't ever watch this movie. It is garbage. Probably the worst movie I've ever seen. Jackie Chan is hardly in it.,1068681600,2,113,4.428571428571429
854826,1,6304389477,"This is an absolutely horrible movie. It has a very similar plot to ""Rummble in the Bronx"", but this movie has none of the good fights (Jackie Chan barely does any marial arts or stunts at all)that ""Rummble in the Bronx"" has, none of the plot, and really is not a true Jackie Chan film. Also stay away from ""Fanatasy Mission Force"", it is just as bad.",1045785600,3,351,4.253731343283582
854827,1,6304389477,"Yes, I got to agree with other people in here, bad movie, amateur and not a Jackie Chan movie. The package give the wrong impression... and the piece of hair on his face! not a good idea..",1043539200,,188,4.108108108108108
854828,2,6304389477,"The folks at budget label Madacy Entertainment are at it again.  This is a really crummy transfer of a very ordinary 1974 Hong Kong action flick which has been retitled to capitalize on the success of Jackie Chan's ""Rumble in the Bronx.""  Jackie's a villain in this one and has a pretty good fight scene towards the end of the film with the hero (a taxi driver!) that gets this two stars rather than one.  The DVD includes a lengthy filmography for Chan, as well as a list of the injuries that he has suffered over the years in making his films.  But other than that, the transfer is the equivalent of a VHS tape at EP speed and the source print itself is bad.  For Chan completists only.  All others, save your money.  I paid five bucks for this and felt like I was robbed.",973987200,4,774,4.260273972602739
854829,1,6304389477,"With the rising success of Jackie Chan this 70s flick aka police woman was re-released with the title rumble in hong kong, trying to cash in on the  success of rumble in the bronx. On the box, it even makes this point. Don't  buy this video. It is a pain to watch. It is awful. Jackie Chan only plays  a minor role in this and the fight scenes aren't too much fun either. The  dubbing is awful and the movie hasn't been reformated for standard tv  viewing. Don't be like me and ignore the reviews of others, this is truely  an awful film and if only I could get my money back for this.",967593600,11,585,4.087719298245614
854830,3,6304389477,"I give it three stars instead of two because I am a Jackie fan. I applaude the message the movie is trying to make, how the business industry intices  kids into drugs and sex. That is it's redeaming quality. Jackie makes a  pretty good bad guy. There are no really bad scenes. It's just lame. Go for  Rumble in the Bronx, it's great.",966211200,,333,4.253968253968254
854831,1,6304389477,"I wasn't sure at first whether I had seen this one or not, but When I read another reviewer's note ""bad mole"" I thought oh yeah...Jackie is not the main character, he plays a bad guy, yes one of those ridiculous bad  guys you see in all other bad Hong Kong action films, the kind that make  stupid mistakes and are no match for the Heroine/Hero.  The print I saw was  just as they said, terrible.  Sometimes you can't even see who is talking,  or you see half of their faces and the dub, oh man-shoot me now!  I adore  Jackie, but this is one you can skip.  That mole sure was ugly...hairs  sticking out....",950745600,5,607,4.2
854959,2,6304389477,"Very low production quality.  View this more as a historical document than a movie.  Also Jackie Chan is a villain, which is kind of unique.",1428969600,,140,4.56

854964,1,6304389477,"This is a Jackie Chan flick almost devoid of Jackie Chan. It's interesting seeing him play a villain, but his appearance is too limited to even list him as a headliner. Terrible production value even for early Hong Kong cinema and an terrible plot.",1395100800,,248,4.659090909090909
854965,1,6304389477,I am a Jackie Chan fan so wanted to see this even with a low rating.  I think I finally turned it off after 15-20 minutes.  One of the worst movies I have attempted to watch.  Not the worst but I couldn't watch it at all.,1375401600,,221,3.760869565217391
854966,2,6304389477,I quit after watching the first 5 minutes or so...  not recommended unless you are looking for movies made in the early 80's or Jackie Chan's early/ancient work.,1363219200,,161,4.75
854967,1,6304389477,"This is a poor bootleg of the 1974 movie called Police Woman. Though it is being marketed as a Jackie Chan film it is not. His role in it is only that of a cameo and his character is referred to as a ""gang member"".",1210291200,3,214,3.7777777777777777

7869154,1,6304389477,"Even big time jackie fans should skip this one. He is very young and plays one of the villains. He has a big mole on his face and he isn't in the movie that much(thats pretty much it). Not much for action or stunts. This movie came out on vhs in the u.s. around the time of Rumble in Bronx. The title makes you think this is the prequel, it is not. This movies actual title was police woman & its original release was in 1972. Save yourself the time; if you want to see an excellent earlier Jackie Chan film check out the original Drunken Master(78), or even better Police Story(85)! (I tried to give it a half star but one is the lowest it allows).",1521072000,,649,4.118110236220472

7869157,1,6304389477,"This movie was ""My God, this is terrible"", poor translation dubbing. Bad pun aside, in the early 70's after the death of Bruce Lee, Hong Movie houses were looking cor the next best export and  exalted Jackie Chan as the Bruce legacy. Unfortunately, greed, horrible script, terrible directors, second rate film photography and God awful post production editing ruined Mr. Chan's early success in Ong Kong cinema. It was rumored that between 1973 and 1978 Hong Kong cinema (excluding Shaw Brothers, Carter Wang and Jimmy Wang Wu) didn't fare well in the western market and this movie highlights that fact. Poor dubbing, film editing and the recycling of the Superfly Movie soundtrack..... Are you serious?  And I guarantee you the reason Jackie 's role was minimal was due to the lack of pay. During that time Jackie walked off several movie shoots because of no pay....Hmmmm...makes you think. The upside to this movie, the fine as wine Betty Tai Pei.....She was a fine ass Chinese actress (the one acting not kicking butt). Also Jacky' s homeboy/cousin (Snake in the Monkey's Shadow). And the actress playing the police woman's role. She was a well known actress throughout the 70's (She was in several well known Shaw Brothers features).  Besides these highlights, avoid 1973 to 1976 Jacky Chan movies...you'll be disappointed. And stay away from the Master with Cracked Fingers....that movie began filming in 1976 with Jacky  Chan and finished in 1978 with a stunt actor. I remember seeing that movie for the first time early spring 1978 as young boy and again on a streaming movie service several years ago and was disappointed that I was duped as a child. LOL.",1459987200,,1664,4.932142857142857
7869158,1,6304389477,"Either have Jackie Chan speaking English or some dielect of Chinese. The filming, sound and English dubbing is horrible. Don't bother unless you want to turn the sound off and have fun like Mystery Science Theater with this one.",1459209600,,228,4.871794871794871
