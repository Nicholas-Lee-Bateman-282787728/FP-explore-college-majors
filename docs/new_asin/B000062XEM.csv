1684579,5,B000062XEM,"I love the 3 pack workout set. With such a busy schedule, there is a choice of which workout to do based on how much time you have.  Need a quick pick me up, the 1 mile is only 18 minutes. That's easy to fit into any schedule.  If you can go 18, 30 minutes isn't much more for the 2 mile.  Well, the three mile is just a little longer but what a great feeling after you're done.  Forty nine minutes of continuous movement and I didn't find I was watching the clock to see when it would be over.  Great for all fitness levels-from couch potato to gym enthusiast.",1029542400,,561,4.018018018018018
1684580,5,B000062XEM,"This DVD is so easy and really works your muscles.  I was a couch potato but now I actually feel guilty if I miss one day.  Leslie is so motivational, there are no facny steps to make you get lost, she tells you right at the start ""If I go left and you go right, that is ok as long as you keep moving"".  I would recommend this video to any one wanting to loose weight.  It's great and it really works!!!!",1026518400,5,404,3.8902439024390243
1684581,2,B000062XEM,"I wasn't that impressed with this, even after reading others reviews BEFORE I bought it.
It is good if you can't get out to walk or if you just want a LIGHT workout or if you are a beginner.  I walk every day and alternate days doing step aerobics and I just didn't feel like I did anything after doing these videos.  I guess my own personal walks are just more intense than these videos.
I will probably enjoy these IN ADDITION to my own workouts to have multiple workouts in a day, but just to do these is not enough for my personal taste.",1024185600,12,541,4.142857142857143
1684582,5,B000062XEM,"This is a great workout!  I love it!  My roommate and I started out with the 1 and 2-mile walk and quickly went on to buy the 3-mile walk.  We have never been much of exercisers but this workout is really easy to follow and stick with.  Although Leslie is a little ""chatty"" she makes the walk go by so quickly.  Before you know it you are done.  The video is easy to adjust to fit you.  I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to loose some weight and also stay/get in shape.",1023235200,11,484,4.031578947368421

1684682,5,B000062XEM,I owned this and misplaced it after moving. So I had to reorder this. This is the best walking dvd set on the market. I have injured neck and spine.

1684683,5,B000062XEM,"My favorite Leslie Sansone workouts are these original walking workouts with the weighted balls (although I just use regular hand-held weights).  The one-mile walk is one of my favorites for when I want a quick workout, especially if I've already done other exercising on that day. The two-mile walk is a fantastic workout, and I like it more than the one-mile workout. After I've done the two-mile workout, I feel like I've had a good workout. The three-mile workout is a great, longer workout for those days when I need one, solid workout, but it's still less than an hour.

I used to own Walk Away the Pounds on videotape+. When I first looked for these workouts on DVD several years ago, I could find only the one-mile and two-mile walks. I bought that DVD and have used it off and on for the past several years. When I saw that someone on Amazon was selling the set with the three-mile walk included, I decided to buy the whole set over again, so that I could add the three-mile walk to my collection and give the other DVD to my daughter.

My only wish is that they would put these on Amazon Instant Video for purchase, so that I wouldn't have to bother with the DVDs at all and could also more easily have them with me (on my laptop or my iPad) when I'm traveling. I would buy these workouts for a fourth time if I could get them on Instant Video.",1362873600,4,1354,4.3438735177865615

1684716,3,B000062XEM,I found the host a bit annoying overall. However it did help me begin to lose weight when I couldn't work out harder. I quickly moved on to other activities though.,1353024000,,164,4.32258064516129
1684717,5,B000062XEM,"This is an excellent low impact walking routine.

If you haven't exercised in a while, are just coming out of injury recovery, or just want to get a little more active then this routine may be for you.

The 1 mile is very easy going, only about fifteen minutes and easy to follow. I would say if you haven't exercised in a while, or, are just coming out of injury recovery forget the weights for about 3-4 weeks. Just learn the routine and get used to the arm motions coupled with the walking.

Because it isn't just walking. Or rather, it isn't just marching in place. Rather it's a series of different leg motions, a side to side move, short and low kicks, knee lifts and easy backwards leg raises.

I've never had dance classes, never was really active in sports when younger, so I was VERY uncoordinated when starting this. It took me three weeks to want to use weights at all. Took me another three weeks beyond that to progress to the 2 mile walk. :-)

But that's okay. Remember, even if you only do fifteen minutes a day you are SO far ahead of those who haven't even begun yet.

LISTEN to what she says. If you can't yet, it's okay. If you have to take a break, it's okay. Take your time. Progress at YOUR pace. Enjoy the increased mobility as it comes. I know I am.",1347667200,,1274,4.265560165975104
1684718,5,B000062XEM,"I've gained a substantial amount of weight and haven't worked out in quite some time.  I grabbed some of my old low-impact VHS tapes but found the moves too difficult and painful to my joints!  I needed something to help me start getting back into shape that wasn't too difficult yet gave me a great cardio workout.  These Walk Away The Pounds videos do just that!  I LOVE that there are only a few easy moves to do yet they really get my heart rate up!  I can also feel the ""good burn"" of working out and not just terrible pain!  Leslie has some sections where she uses weights but they are optional.  My new weights just arrived so I'll be using them with this video today and I can't wait!  If you live in a place where the weather sometimes doesn't permit you to walk outside, these dvds are also perfect to get your walk in when you can't get out.  I also like that there are three workouts so you can progress to more miles or if you just want to do a quick workout you can do one of the shorter ones.  Love these videos!",1334361600,,1027,4.141414141414141
1684719,5,B000062XEM,"I tossed this much used video [in VHS form] after purchasing a flat screen with DVD TV...big mistake! It was my favorite ""Walk Away"", having gotten used to the people Leslie works with. It's a nice group of people, and Leslie makes this fun, easy, enjoyable. It's addictive in a good way! I went on a hunt, utilizing Collage Video, where I originally bought it and they no longer carry it. However, a nice young woman gave me the catalog number and as usual, I found it here @ my friend....Amazon! Happy to see it's now on DVD. Love this video. It helped me work off about 60 lbs 9 years ago. It still works. With any of Leslie's videos, you're actually doing the number of miles using just 5 or 6 simple steps.....no confusing choreography, no fancy footwork to remember....easy, easy, easy all the way! I do the 2-mile,[also contains the 1 + 3 mile too] and it's in 30 minutes....actually less because there's a few minutes of warm up/cool down. That's it, you've walked [briskly] 2 miles in 25 minutes.....who doesn't have time for that? No leaving the house, no joining a $$$ Club. I also use her 1 lb weights and that's a bonus. It's true, none of the ""machine workout"" you get @ the $$$ clubs. However, you will sweat, get your pulse elevated, and briskly walk 1, 2, or 3 miles when done. It's great for the 40 and up group. I feel so much better after using it everyday now for 3 weeks. If you want a fun, easy walk with friends, this is it! So glad I re-found it!",1328659200,4,1471,4.333333333333333

1684721,5,B000062XEM,"I had beem chair bound for two years due to Parkinson's and unknown hip problems.
The doctors thought that my pain was neurological as they did x-rays and MRI did not show anything, but when I went to a chiropractor several years later, he took an x-ray and showed that I needed to have both hips replaced which I did last year. The bottom line is that I do not have any pain now but my muscles have become very weak.  After I used up my PT benefits, I knew I needed something else.  I had bought the DVD  about two years ago, but was unable to use them because of the pain.  Now I use them every day for 30 minutes.  I cannot tell you how much my muscles have gotten stronger.  I still cannot march in  place but am able to do all the other steps as long as I have my walker for stabilty. I know it is going to take my a while to get the strength required to walk in place, but have noticed that my strength in my legs lets me walk a few steps without my walker or any other help.  I have been told, however, that I will need my walker due to the Parkinson's as this makes my balance unsecure.  This is a great excersise DVD,",1308614400,,1126,3.968888888888889
1684722,4,B000062XEM,"I have just started these DVDs and am already pleased with the results. I like it because the movements are basic, but you get a really good, fairly intense workout. I have no rhythm, and have a lot of trouble with any kind of dance aerobics, so this is perfect for me. Yes, the music is kind of cheesy, but the beats help me with pacing. Yes, the enthusiastic comments from the background people can sound a bit staged. Yes, Leslie's perkiness can be annoying, but I pretend she is Cheri O'teri doing an exercise video spoof, which makes me laugh. But I have to tell you, it is a totally do-able workout with three time options to choose from to help fit it into my schedule.

I recommend it to beginners or intermediate level aerobics fans. I highly recommend it if you have clumsy coordination like me, or feel silly doing the cha-cha in front of your TV!",1307404800,,858,4.39622641509434
1684723,4,B000062XEM,"I've been using this particular set of DVDs as in-home workouts since about 2008 or so, and I attest that, with regular usage since 2009, the workouts have helped me lose almost 50 pounds since last year.  I also use two 2-pound weighted balls (not purchased through Leslie Sansone) during each workout session.

The 1-Mile Walk is great for a quick workout to get your metabolism going.  I often pair it with the original Tae-Bo 8-Minute Workout from 1998 to give me at least 20+ minutes or so of cardio.

The 2-Mile Walk is perfect as it is.  A great 30-minute blast that really is very effective in burning those calories!

The 3-Mile Walk is the best and most challenging for me. I start sweating about a mile into it, and I don't stop sweating even afterward!  I enjoy the various combinations of kickbacks with lateral raises, knee lifts and arm workouts and the incorporation of the weighted balls throughout the latter half of the walk.

What I don't care for is the constant chatter. It seems to get in the way a bit and throws her off at times, such as in the 2-Mile walk. I also don't care for the religious slant in the 3-Mile Walk, with such off-hand comments as ""You better put a little bit of heaven into it! It makes me feel good!"" and ""God is smart!""  Also, do we have to hear about Jody (sp?) having a baby at the beginning of each workout?  I know some have taken to listening to music on their mp3 players while they use WATP to avoid hearing the chatter.  Might not be such a bad idea! :)  Aside from that, these are good aerobic workouts that really do help take off the pounds, and I do recommend them!",1292371200,2,1625,4.362126245847176

1684745,5,B000062XEM,"the instructor in this video is a bit overly happy and talkative, but I'm good at tuning her out.

I agree that these workouts are not intense, like my Jillian Michaels DVDs are. However, I'm not always up for an intense workout.  I have some joint problems and these tapes have been good because they are low impact.  On the Jillian tapes, I have to modify some movements to decrease impact and intensity.  With the walking workouts, I can modify to ADD some intensity - like using the weights longer or doing short bursts of the higher-impact version of some of the movements.  I've been doing the 2 mile in the morning before work, which seems to be perfect for when I'm still stiff (gets me warm and more limber) - and doesn't take too long. These workouts are perfect for beginners, people who are overweight, or who have joint or back problems or injuries.",1267401600,2,894,4.5

At first, I was sure that I would die before I finished the one mile workout, but now, just two months later, I am breezing through the two mile workout, and looking forward to incorporating the 3 mile workout into my routine.  I am pleased with the results I have gotten.  I have lost 10 pounds, while building muscle, and I have gone down one dress size, and I feel great!

There are 3 choices: 1 mile, 2, and 3 miles.  Surprisingly they are a real workout.  And some days ""just walking"" is what I want to do, no complicated moves, just a good wake up walk.  It would be a great workout for anybody - even older adults!  If you can march in place - you can do the workout. No snow or rain, you don't even have to leave the house.  There are lots of accessory moves to challenge your upper body and side steps and moves for better balance that you wouldn't be doing on a walk in the neighborhood or in the mall.  You can just use soup cans instead of her special weights, or don't use any weights - still a workout.  Have fun.",1203033600,2,806,4.018867924528302

And combined with watching what I eat, I have been walking off those pounds (21 of them so far) since mid-May. The one drawback is that there is virtually no warm up in the three mile walk -- I believe another reviewer pointed that out.  It is an intense enough walk (3 mile) that I would want to take an extra five minutes before starting it to warm up.  I do like the three mile for its greater use of weights, and the fact that there are exercises for the triceps toward the end.
A piece of advice -- I would suggest investing in good aerobic (not walking shoes).  My feet started getting sore in the ball area because in these videos you do a lot of ball to heel rather than heel to toe motion. A good pair of aerobic shoes took care of that problem.",1188086400,2,876,4.046242774566474

I'm definitely aware that I've done a workout, but without aches and pains. I'm over 40, so safety and easyness were upmost in choosing any exercise program.

The moves are all  based on walking, don't require a lot of room, but raise my heart rate enough so that I am sweating by the end. I alternate between the 2 & 3 mile workouts which are 30 & 45 minutes long. The cool downs are not very long so I do my own afterwards. Both workouts use 2 lb. weights at some point, but Sansone emphasizes that you don't have to. I like that the video is easy to follow, you don't have to be a contortionist to execute the moves and yet you get a good aerobic workout. It's the first one I've actually used on a regular basis.",1170288000,3,833,4.079268292682927

It's great to have 3 different workouts to chose from (1, 2 or 3 miles), depending on how much time you have to exercise.  And it uses light hand-weights (she of course recommends her Walk-away-the-pounds weighted balls, but just use your own 2-3 lb. handweights) which helps add some intensity, though you can always do any of the workouts without the weights.

I love that Leslie's stuff is simple, no complicated, hard-to-follow dance moves.  Her banter is cheesy, but hey it's a great work out!  I get much more out of this walking workout than I do walking on a treadmill.",1166486400,4,475,4.363636363636363

It can all be done in a small room in front of your DVD player and television.

This is absolutely perfect for anyone getting started in exercise, as it is low impact and takes up no space. Other than possibly wanting to buy two exercise balls which are listed for sale inside the dvd set at about 10 bucks before shipping, you need nothing but this dvd, good shoes and a dvd-player and TV or even just a computer.

When the 1 mile workout is too easy, you can step up to a 2 mile workout. The advantage here is that the PACE and the DISTANCE are set by walking with Leslie and her team. You will know you did the right workout rather than guess if ambling around the block really got your heatrate up and was the right distance for an effective workout. Needless to say, if you don't like walking in bad weather, this is a great thing to keep at home for crummy days with rain, snow, heat or cold.",1161475200,8,1111,4.162790697674419

I can wear whatever I want to wear - sometimes it's just a tee shirt and tennis shoes. I've tried all three of the walks but particularly enjoy the 2-mile walk.

1684864,5,B000062XEM,"This set is fantastic.  I just started using it two weeks ago and am already starting to notice a difference... not major, but a difference.  Believe me, this set is great for any age and any activity level... so if you are beginner, these are a great place to start.  I had been either walking at work during my lunch or doing the treadmill at home, which I find totally monotonous and BORING!!!  A friend told me about Leslie's videos and that she has been doing them for 8 years!!!!  I knew if she had stuck with them for 8 years, they must be great so I figured what the heck!

I have always struggled with my weight but was able to stay at a reasonable weight until I hit 40.  Then, well everything went downhill from there!!!  Now, I am 49 and with menopause (and the lovely weight and symptoms that come along with that!), undergoing a kidney transplant and suffering from the normal aches and pains of getting older, I had a hard time doing most videos and believe me, I have well over 50 different tapes spanning the past 30 years!  After doing the 18-minute mile the first day, I knew this workout was for me.  My knees didn't kill me the next day and I felt great... definitely felt like I worked out, but not to the point where I didn't want to do it again.  The great thing is having the 18-min., 1-mile and the 30-min., 2-mile.  On days where I am trying to squeeze in exercise, the 18-minute is perfect.  Then, the other days, I do the 2-mile.  I also purchased the 4-mile super challenge, but haven't been able to do that one yet... hopefully, this weekend!!!  For once, I can finally say that I am motivated to exercise and for me, that is a major statement.  I am really looking forward to getting back into my size 4 pants that I have been saving since my late 30's!!!

Believe me, out of all the workout videos I own, this is the first one I have ever written a review for, because I feel so strongly about Leslie's programs.  Such simple steps and very easy to follow.  If you are looking for a great workout program, this set is a great starting point and then you can add some of Leslie's other WOTP's videos to change it up a bit... you won't be sorry!",1149120000,25,2176,4.263414634146342

I started with the 2 mile walk after having spent several months doing pilates and Crunch Firm and Burn Pilates.  After about a month I have moved to the 3 mile walk without weights.

The series is entirely low impact, but the added weight increases the calorie burning and toning value of the series.  I did not buy the Walk Away the Pounds weighted balls, and use a series of 2 lbs weights I purchased at the local store.  They appear to work just fine.

The only real complaint I have for the series is I am used to a longer stretch and toning session and the end of the workout.  I miss having a mat session.  I correct this buy doing a short pilates session on my own after I finish.",1148169600,6,801,4.189542483660131

You also get an upper body workout by adding weights for a portion of the workout.  I started with the 1 mile but am now doing the 2 mile workout.

I really love that I sweat during the work out, but that I never get really out of breath.  Also, I can tell a big difference in my flexibility and balance!  I just love starting my day each morning with this workout.  I've been recommending this workout to everyone who has stopped and asked how I've been losing weight!

*My mom did this workout with me once (she is 59 and needs to lose about 50 pounds, I am 27 and need to lose about 70 more) and her big complaint was that no one in the video looks like they need to lose weight.  Everyone looks like they are well within their healthy weight limit (even the woman who just had the baby).  They look more like they just want to firm and tone.  This doesn't bother me, because I just imagine that it was working out that got them to look so good, but I thought I'd mention it in case it helps anyone make up their mind on whether to buy it.",1142985600,11,1271,4.068273092369478

You can adapt the moves to your level of fitness, which is great. I tend to do the side moves as more of a jump lunge than just a step-out, and I use my arms more frequently. Add the weights and it's a great total body aerobic workout.

Great if you are just beginning a workout routine, or if you're snowed in. Leslie is her usual chirpy self, so if that annoys you, this isn't for you. But I find it makes me happy to hear someone that pleasant first thing in the morning (beats the news, definitely), and helps get me through.

1684931,5,B000062XEM,"This was my first introduction into the Walk Away the Pounds series.  I'm not obese, but I am relatively out of shape and was looking for some way to exercise that would be fun and physically challenging without facing the usual problems of coordination with workout videos.  Leslie's videos are perfect.  This DVD includes 3 workouts, an 18 minute 1 Mile, a 30 minute 2 Mile, and a 45 minute 4 mile.  All of her workouts include the basic steps:
-Walking
-Side steps
-Kicks
-Knee lifts
She also does kickbacks in the 30 minute and 45 minute walks which are one of my favorite moves.  The moves are basic so you can focus on challenging yourself and getting your heart rate up.  The music isn't always the best, and while some have complained of her chatter I was surprised to find I enjoy it.  She will talk to you the whole workout and often the friendly group of ladies who she is walking with in this videos will chime in.  I love the way it does make it seem like something familiar and pleasant, rather than a more intimidating video instructor screaming at you to work harder.  While you are walking you will also see a little graphic occasionally appear at the bottom to tell you how far in the ""miles"" you have gone.

I started with the one mile for several weeks and then moved on to the two mile.  Both were challenging the first time through, and the two mile uses her walk away weights, which are 2 lb weighted balls.  You can do the workouts without the weights just as easily, and I sometimes use my 3 lb hand weights instead. The 45 minute is still a challenge as though the intensity doesn't increase, you need to work up your stamina to get to that point.  But it feels great once you have completed a 3 mile walk.  I would recommend this DVD as a great way to get started with Leslie Sansone's videos, increase your fitness, and have a pleasant but challenging workout that you can look forward to and not feel like an idiot doing.",1139443200,11,1950,4.3805555555555555

I have been using the 2 and 3 mile videos for a couple years now and I absolutely love them.  If you can't stand the high-pitched squeeling of little blonde beach chicks jumping around and expecting you to master every aerobic move they have ever learned - then this is the video for you.  Leslie keeps you motivated, offers suggestions on how you can alter the workout to make it comfortable and safe for your body type and athletic level and she has REAL women working out with her.  It is wonderful to see women (and one guy, Randy!) of all age types and body types doing this workout with you.  I even got my mom hooked on this and she has used the 2 mile five days a week for over a year and now she sleeps through the night, has no back and leg pains and has increased her muscle tone.  I can't recommend this enough to anyone who is looking for a fun, easy to modify workout that isnt' necessarily a fitness nut.

I rely heavily on Leslie Sansone's workouts to get me through the PA winters when the weather and fewer hours of daylight make it hard to always get outside for a ""real"" walk.  I love Leslie's workouts, and I keep adding to my collection of them. This DVD is especially nice because it gives you a choice of three workouts ranging from 1-3 miles.  Perfect so that I can choose according to how much time and energy I have (or don't have!) on any given day.  I think these workouts are great for anyone... from someone like me who has power walked for years, to the person who might just have decided that it's time to get active.  My kids (10 and 3) even do them with me sometimes, on a different level than I do, of course!  The bottom line is that you can put as much or as little as you want to into each workout, depending on the results you're hoping to get.

The great thing is that each is a different length both in time and miles, so if you only have 20 minutes and don't have time to take a shower afterwards, you can do the 1 mile workout and not necessarily break a sweat, but still get some exercise.  The 3 mile, 47 minute workout including the weights is the most intense of the 3, and will definitely break a sweat.  The nice thing about these is you can combine the different workouts for a total of 6 miles (or more, if you watch one over again!).  And for the guys (that's me), there's one older guy in the back in sweats (no fancy workout duds) for the males watching this to relate to.

The twenty minute, one-mile routine has been approachable even for THIS former couch potato, and I feel great when I'm done.  Best of all, even at just twenty minutes, it's been enough activity to nudge me out of a weight loss plateau.  The routines take very little space and minimal equipment -- weight balls are suggested for portions of each one, but soup cans work just as well and really help to tone your arms while you walk.

This DVD set allows you to gradually work up to the two- and three-mile routines as you get yourself into better shape, and ""gentler"" alternatives are offered for each step and movement so that you can customize your workout to your own level of fitness. My only regret with these walking routines is that I didn't begin them sooner.",1136851200,8,942,4.491228070175438

1 mile program is very easy. Even if you have been a couch potato all your life, you can master this in no time. I do enjoy the 2 mile walk because, it takes about a half hour which is perfect for me. Sometimes when I feel a little more energetic, I do the 3 mile program. For me it is still a challenge.

I tried other DVDs as well but they are usually very difficult to keep up with. Even some of Leslie Sansone's other programs are like that. I own another set which really leaves me breathless.

I actually bought this set twice. A co-worker had borrowed them and never bothered to return them back. What made me real upset is, I just do not remember who had borrowed them. I have sent e-mails to all possible co-workers and none of them came back to me and returned my DVDs. I guess, she liked them so much that she decided never to return them...

Some people criticize that she makes religion related comments but even though, I am Muslim, that did not bother me at all because, her remarks are generally very universal and is true for every religion where people believe there is only one GOD. She is quite a chatter-box and that makes the program go fast. If you get tired of hearing the same stuff, just put on some other music that you like.

What a great way to work out with the kids!  It doesn't take too much room so all of us can work out in our livingroom without me constantly telling my kidlets to get out of mommy's way!  Anyway, I plan on sticking with this regime, and look forward to going up to two, then three, then even the four mile workouts!",1125964800,5,864,3.8579545454545454

I tried the 1, 2 & 3 mile and find them incredibly boring.  I didn't break a sweat and the moves are very very simple.

1684983,5,B000062XEM,"The 1, 2 and 3 mile walks are the perfect steps to get you up and walking.

I love how they can be modified as your fitness level improves. For example, I add ankle weights and wrist weights to make the workouts more challenging.

All though I don't often use the one mile anymore I use the 2nd and 3rd Mile constantly, they are perfect as a supplemental workout after doing higher impact aerobics.

The workout with the added weights (I use regular hand weights), has really gotten my back and arms in great shape and because you use them as you walk, it makes the arm workout far less tedious then any arm workout without the added foot movement.

I love Leslie Sansone she's motivational and cheerful but not annoyingly fake. The group she works out with is fun and diverse, and after doing this workout for four month's not too annoying. I Also have ""Walk and Jog"", and ""Super Challenge"" workouts,  which are also both very good. I'd definitely recommend Leslie Sansone's workouts to any skill level either for beginners or as a supplemental workout for more advanced. The steps are easy to follow and almost full proof.  Your given the option of using the weights if you wish and she always has someone who modifies the movements to compensate for a smaller range of motion. .",1113782400,11,1281,4.572052401746725
1684984,5,B000062XEM,"I absolutely love this walk-away-the-pounds DVD. I was hesitant at first to get this DVD when I saw it on and off as an infomercial a long time ago as I thought it wasn't intense enough, but this past winter, I really missed walking. I walk outdoors in the Spring and Summer but felt I should probably have a walking type workout so I can walk when it's not warm out or raining/snowing/cold/windy, etc. Well, I finally got this and gave it a try and I love it! I felt like I should have had it a long time ago. It has 1 and 2 mile workouts. The 2 mile-30 minute workout is the one I love. It's perfect for me to do every morning and get a good sweat and feel toned as well. There are very simple but effective moves like kicking, knee lifts, side step. Then towards the end you workout with weights which is highly effective. I have 5 lb. dumbbells which is what I use, the dvd uses 2 lb. balls (which you can buy for $9.99, a little expensive I thought), beside I get a more intense workout with 5 lb. weights because I'm used to them in my other workout DVDs.

This is a simple and effective workout, I highly recommend it. No fancy steps you feel you cannot keep up with. You concentrate more on working than step coordination. Leslie is fun to watch and inspiring. You need very little room to do this workout. I also have her 3 mile workout when I have more time on weekends and it's perfect, it is the same as the 2mile but longer and you really sweat and firm up. She uses arms, upper body, lower body so it's an overall fitness workout. You will see results if you do it regularly, just give it a few weeks. Once you have lost the weight, then incorporate some abs workout yourself for 5 minutes. But this is a great aerobics workout, I don't feel bad if I don't go out for a walk on some days because I get one just as good with this. I would highly recommend this. Next, I will try her walk and jog DVD.",1113436800,5,1913,4.114973262032086
1684985,4,B000062XEM,"Over the course of the last several years I've let myself get really out of shape. This set sounded good for a variety of reasons and, though I've only had it about a week, so far I'm pleased.

First, I like this set because it's on DVD. Because I travel a lot on business it's tough to follow a fitness routine. I'm able to play the DVDs on my laptop computer so I have no excuse not to exercise while I'm on the road.

Secondly, this set includes three different workouts. The one mile, two mile and three mile workouts. That variety both lets me work my way up without trying to tackle the three mile right away (I told you I'm out of shape!) and will let me get a quick 20 minute workout (the one mile walk) in when I have little time (even once I'm up to the three mile walk). Again, no excuses not to work out.

There's a little of the usual ""rah, rah"" type stuff, but it's not obnoxious. I usually find that stuff really annoying and I don't find myself annoyed with it on this video.

I don't have the weight balls they talk about but I do have wrist weights (I think they're 1 1/2 lbs.) that I use in place of them. It's fair to say you could do without the weight balls but using some type of weights is part of what makes the workout aerobic, so I recommend using some kind of weight (heck, use a bag of beans or some canned foods if you have to - it all works!)

Seriously, I'm really out of shape and this is already proving to be a good system for me so I really recommend it (I only gave it four stars, but it's nearly impossible to get five stars from me... for five stars this thing would have to make coffee and do the dishes for me!)",1113264000,9,1652,4.039755351681957

I recently had my second child and have about 25 pounds to lose, plus I wanted to build up some stamina to keep up with my two boys!  These are really fun to do.  The people walking with Leslie look like real people, you can tell they're working hard as well, and Leslie does a good job of keeping a count so you know when to start a new move or go back to walking. I had been doing Pilates but needed something more cardio-based to get my weight loss going.  This seems to be doing the trick.

My only quibble is the ""selling"" of the walk away weighted balls.  It gets a little old to hear her hawk them, but I just tune it out.",1113264000,2,686,3.906474820143885
1684987,5,B000062XEM,"Wow, let me start by saying I am the most uncoordinated person ever.  I've got a whole library of fitness dvd's sitting around collecting dust thanks to the WATP series.  I can't stress how much this dvd has helped me change my life.  Since November 2004 I have dropped 50+ pounds and I'm still dropping!  I usually workout every single day, interchanging the 1, 2, and 3 mile workouts.  In general though, I get the 3 mile workout in at least 3 times a week.  I have also begun to train with the FIRM parts series now that I have developed more endurance and energy.  I know I'll reach my goal thanks to Leslie and her workouts.

What's made this so effective for me is the EASE and SIMPLICITY of the workouts.  You have absolutely no excuse not to do them.  This coming from someone who absolutely HATED exercise, and now I can't live without my 3 mile walk a day.

PS.

I did watch my calorie intake while on this program, but nothing too drastic....if you stick to it, the pounds will come off!

I have a toddler, and it's very hard to do floor exercises without my daughter hanging off my legs or tripping me.

These DVD's are perfect for me!  I can do them when my daughter is around without fear that I'm going to whack her in the head with my leg.  She marches along too!  I save the DVD's with floor exercises for when she naps.

The 1 mile is great for when I don't have much time but I want to exercise, and the 2 mile makes me work up a sweat.  It's great because before you know it, you walked the 2 miles.  Leslie is a little overly perky, but she keeps me going.

I haven't tried the 3 mile yet, but I'm sure it's just as good as the other 2.

I have only been using these DVD's for a week, but I can already notice that I can walk farther and faster in real life than I could before without getting tired.",1111363200,8,995,3.900497512437811
1685028,5,B000062XEM,"I never would have thought I would get the kind of workout from walking like I did from this DVD! I just purchased this one plus the 4 mile Super Challenge. I didn't think I was that out of shape (I'm a college student without a car, so I walk everywhere - grocery store, laundry, class, etc), but I started to sweat during the 1 mile! Since I wasn't breathing hard, I went ahead and did the 2 mile as well. Holy macaroni I'm tired! From simple things like widening your step while walking to small knee lifts, I really felt the workout right away in my thighs, buns and lower back. And those arm raises - I had to put my weights down I was getting so tired! I'm going to have to try to do the 1 mile every day.

While this DVD was definately good for working the legs, I would recommend on your heavy exercising days to add another workout for arms and abs. While I worked my arms and shoulders, it wasn't targeted like triceps and biceps and I would add in another program to make sure you worked them. I also felt my abs working, but not to the extreme another workout might (I use Tamilee's I Want That Body for these sections).

And like other people have said, Leslie sure is a chatterer. It does get a little bothersome, but I kind of tone her out. I get the fact that we're doing, say, kneeraises and she doesn't have to say ""Kneeraise!"" on each one. The people working with her are also chipper and they never lose their smiles. The one thing I find funny is that a lot of the women seem to have big breasts - even the 50 yr old woman!

All in all, I really enjoyed this DVD. Even on just the 2mile, I can feel it working while I'm doing it. Maybe tomorrow I'll find some sore muscles that I didn't quite feel while I was in the middle of it.

It begins by warming up, gets a bit more brisk, then the cool down and stretch just as you're supposed to.  I am up to 2 miles and can really tell a difference!

You may have to add more arms or add the weighted balls for the whole workout.  If you want to it is easy to up your workout and feel a burn and sweat.  I love these videos because they are fun and they great.  You really don't even feel like it is a workout because you are having too much fun along the way.  For people who are just starting you may want to do the 1 mile walk and once you get used to the moves (which are not difficult) you can move to the two mile and once conformable move up to the three mile.  But, if you have been working out for a while these videos are great to mix if you are in a lazy mood but want a workout the 1 mile is great for that.  Or you can up the workout on all the videos by adding weights or arms or any variation.  These were my first Leslie videos and they are the best but I love all the them even the older ones-that I find at my Library.  Her videos are encouraging and fun.

I have used this 3 times now.  I can not get past the .25-.50 of the 1 mile 'walk'  but I do it 2 times a day.  It is easy, and keeps me going.  I can make myself do it and right now pace it to myself, in time I can keep up.  In the past when I did walk, it was a slow shuffle along, even as a kid and I was at most 10 lb's overweight then.

1685033,4,B000062XEM,"After pregnancy, this workout was the best thing ever!  The one mile gets you off the couch because it's simple and you know you can face it.  The two mile isn't uncomfortable, but for a beginner easing into a workout routine, you feel like you're accomplishing something, and with repetition, you can really feel the muscle use.  The three mile gets your heart rate going, and the whole program is motivating because you can do it without killing yourself.

The cast has a variety of body types and ages (but I wonder why the super sculpted woman is in the back in all three videos), so you don't feel ridiculous, no matter what shape you're in.  Leslie's frequent promotion of the workout during the video manages to be motivating for the most part, instead of annoying, but--as with any workout, some of her banter is forced and gets tiresome.

I don't use the weight balls with this workout, but it definitely helped me get back into a real exercise pattern.  The steps are basic, and the workouts go fast, so it's all very manageable.  You will probably want some other routines to spice things up if you're working out more than twice a week--and you might also want something that focuses specifically on abs.  I would recommend this program to anyone who hasn't been to the gym in a while and just doesn't know where to start, as well as anyone who's looking for something basic and easy to add to their workout collection.",1106956800,6,1431,4.602362204724409

I usually do the 2 mile walk because it is a good workout and a perfect amount of time for me to carve out in the morning.  If I want a bit more out of it I do weights through the whole 2 mile.  I don't have the weighted balls, so I bought 2 lb dumbells from the sporting goods store and they work just as well.

This system really is perfect for anyone who needs to get some good exercise in but who may be inexperienced, uncoordinated, or not have a lot of time. I started with the 1-mile, then moved on to the 2-mile, and have done the 3-mile twice so far. All three are great light aerobic workouts! The 1-mile is 18 minutes so it's perfect when time is short but I want to squeeze something in--it's a gentle workout, but you feel your muscles working. The 2-mile is the one I do most often--it's not too intense, but you definitely start to feel yourself sweating after a while. The time goes quickly and before you know it, you're done. The 3-mile is a bit more intense and if you're out of shape, it will challenge you, but not to the ""breaking"" point. Anyway, if you start to feel it's a bit too much you can always just keep walking and not do the extra moves, or you can just do 1 or 2 miles out of the 3-mile walk. The weights are optional--I don't use any and it's not a problem.

Leslie Sansone is chatty, but very pleasant, and while some of the other walkers behind her seem coached in what to say, it's not too bad. This is a GREAT way to lose weight and get fit for beginners. Just start with the 1-mile and do more when you feel ready. You will see results if you stick to it (I have begun to already).

Beginners won't have any problem with this and adding weights to both the arms or the ankles. The steps are extremely easy, just walking in place, knee lifts, kickbacks and double steps.

You will read lots of opinions in the following reviews, but here are the facts:
* WATP is a balanced exercise program promoting fitness for individuals of all ages and physical descriptions. Regardless of whether you are young, old, overweight, out of shape, have physical limitations or are in prime condition - these workouts have something to offer!  Expect a few minutes of warm-up time followed by exercises of graduating speed and intensity, a cool-down period and a few quick stretches to wrap it all up.
* These WATP workouts are equivalent to walking 1, 2 or 3 miles at a brisk pace.  Each includes simple steps (marching in place, side-steps, knee-lifts and kick-backs), upper body work (reaching, stretching, pull-downs and clapping) and an opportunity to incorporate light weight training along with the cardio.  (Personal note: I prefer using dumbells rather than the Walk Away Weighted Balls simply because you can buy them anywhere, they are easier to hold and don't get slippery in my hands when I sweat - plus, I can vary the amount of weight I want to use on a daily basis.)
* These workouts can be easily personalized and modified to suit your own fitness level while giving you the motivation to increase your strength, endurance and stamina.  You just cannot do it wrong no matter what.
* YOU WILL LOSE POUNDS AND INCHES!  Be consistent and you won't believe how quickly your body begins slimming down and toning up! In only 6 weeks I have shed 22 pounds by eating sensibly and working out with Leslie every day.
* Leslie is cheerful and motivates you all the way through the workout.  Some sourpusses don't like that much, but I don't consider it a flaw.  Instead, I am impressed that she is able to lead the workout and verbally coach through the duration without getting winded. Some of her chatter IS repetative, but that has no affect on the quality of the workout.
* You never fully ""outgrow"" these workouts because you can always up the challenge by increasing the weight of your dumbells, adding ankle and wrist weights, or just pushing yourself to workout longer or at a higher intensity.  Combining workouts is another way to challenge yourself further.  I like doing the WATP 3-Mile Super Fat Blaster followed by the WATP Express 4-Mile Super Challenge.
* WATP workouts may not be challenging enough for power athletes, but for the majority of us who want fitness results without wasting our time and money on intimidating, painful and ultimately impossible workouts - WATP is the ONLY way to go.
God bless you Leslie and keep your lovable chatty workouts coming!",1078099200,77,2767,4.784067085953878

1685126,5,B000062XEM,I recently gave birth to my second child and want to get back into my original size before summer hits!  This is a GREAT workout set!  The one mile is a wonderful low-impact start that will get you sweating and prepare you for the more challanging 2 mile.  I haven't gotten to the 3 mile yet but I'm sure it will be a great workout!  This is a fun way to exercise inside and you don't need much space at all!!  Adding hand weights to any of the 3 is a great way to add more of a challange.  I highly recommend these!,1077321600,8,516,3.9611650485436893
1685127,4,B000062XEM,"Last year I resolved to get in shape and bought an infomercial DVD called Power 90.  I tried it once, and gave up.  Yes, I am a total couch potato, very overweight and out of shape, and a mommy of 2.  I realized I needed something much easier to get me started, something that wasn't going to depress me because it was too overwhelming, and something I could use to help ease me back in to being active again.  I've always loved to walk and read other reviews here so thought I'd give this one a shot.  I received it today, opened it up, and popped it in our DVD player.  It's perfect!  My 4 year old son started doing it with me right then and there, and while it was way to easy for most folks who are in better shape, for me it was the perfect first step.  No complicated moves which helped my 4 year old say ""Mommy, let's do this every day!"" and he had a blast doing something alongside me.  Within a few minutes I could feel that I was indeed getting a workout, but I wasn't so overwhelmed or breathless that I wanted to give up at all.  This is simple to get you up off the couch and moving after being sedentary for a long time, and it is pleasant to listen to the music which slowly speeds up and slows down.  One thing I liked is that the people working out with Leslie are not ""skinny Minnies"", they aren't fat either, but they look like normal people not drugged out, worked out skeletons with smiles pasted on.  The women were obviously in good shape and had nice figures, but they had curves!!!  I felt that watching them I might be able to attain this look, and don't have to be a powerhouse aerobic queen to do it.  If you really want to start a simple excercise program but don't want to work out all that hard, this is the ticket.  Again, this is really for us slugs who haven't had our heart rates up to over 90 in the past 5 years, so if you are in even decent shape, you might find this rather boring and certainly not challenging enough for you.",1077148800,8,1966,4.123359580052494
1685128,5,B000062XEM,"I have been looking for a good simple aerobic workout that I can do at home for a long time.  I prefer jogging to anything, but have trouble getting out of the house (I have 2 toddlers).  This one is very good.  I dislike dancing and complicated sequences, and this workout has clear, simple, easy to follow steps.
It is also as intense as you make it.  If you are just getting started in an exercise program you'll be able to find success in this program, if you feel you are in shape you can also get a good workout by some simple alterations she shows you.  The first routine is a 20 minute 1 mile walk.  The second is a 30 minute 2 mile walk.  She shows you how to adjust to meet your own physical capabilities.",1075939200,2,715,4.13768115942029
1685129,3,B000062XEM,This is a good program to use if you are just starting a work-out program.

It really gets your heart rate up and that is what you want if you are trying to loose weight. I found it easy to follow. Leslie is a good instructor and I really liked the encoragement about how you didn't have to get every step right just keep moving! It is great for everyone. My mother is 50 and I'm 24 and we love doing it together. She has bone density problems and the doctor told her this would be great and he told me it would be a good way to loose those few pounds I gained in college.",1074556800,6,613,3.8346456692913384
1685132,5,B000062XEM,"Leslie Sansone's program is fantastic. It is ideal for beginners or those who are permanently uncoordinated, but it can also grow to fit the needs of the more experienced. It provides a great workout that works your upper body as well as your lower.  The program is great because it grows with you, starting at 1 mile and working up to 3 miles. She also has a 4 mile program that I like a lot too. You don't have to buy the walk-away weighted balls. It's just as easy to use handweights. You can make the program harder as you get more fit. You can work up to heavier weights or use the weights throughout the video.  Or if you don't have much time, you can choose a shorter mileage and just use the weights throughout.  This is so adaptable and versatile to the exercisers needs.  I love it.  Leslie isn't annoying.  She doesn't talk too much.  The people in her group aren't too bad, and even if you don't like someone, they're easy to ignore.  I like to combine the 3 mile program with Tamilee Webb's I Want That Body! for optimum results.",1069459200,15,1042,4.335051546391752

I am now able to go up stairs without any pain. I have since gone on to more advanced workouts. This workout is good for people, who don't workout, or mostly a couch potato.

It's great for those of us who are uncoordinated and lazy.  If you can walk, you can do this workout.  The people on the tape are very friendly and you can just sense it.
If you can lift your legs and lift your arms and walk, but are lazy like me, then this is the tape for you.",1057536000,,453,3.6979166666666665
1685135,5,B000062XEM,"I've been using Leslie Sansone exercise routines intermittently for a number of years, but irregularly.  However, since trying the ""Walk Away the Pounds"" routines, my exercise habits have changed for the better and I now exercise every day.
I am diabetic and have difficulty exercising outdoors in warm/hot weather (erratic blood glucose levels) -- these exercise routines have solved that difficulty for me.  I am also asthmatic and have difficulty exercising too strenuously outdoors or at the gym, particularly in spring and summer.  I used to fear a hypoglycaemic or asthmatic attack.
That is all now in the past, thanks to Leslie Sansone.  I can now exercise daily, in the comfort of my own home, at my own pace -- sometimes putting all my effort into the routine, and other times just performing the lower body movements without moving the arms around too much.  My fitness level has increased over the past two months, so much so that I now also include some Pilates as well a couple of times a week.  I have also purchased other Leslie Sansone walking workouts, and have introduced my 74-year old mother in Australia to them as well.
I find Leslie's patter pleasant and encouraging to listen to.  The routines do not contain difficult-to-follow choreography, which can leave one tripping over ones own feet and out of breath (and consequently giving up).
My thanks to Leslie Sansone for playing a major part (albeit unknowingly) in the stabilisation of my diabetes and asthma, and, to top it all off, I've managed to lose a few pounds as well.  I am now fitter at 54 than I was at 44, or even 34.  Thank you, Leslie Sansone.
I encourage anyone who wants a simple, easy-to-follow routine that works, that one can fit into any lifestyle, to try Leslie Sansone's ""Walk Away the Pounds"" routines.  You can't go wrong!",1056326400,5,1821,4.8076923076923075
1685176,5,B000062XEM,"Hands down, this is the best workout ever for anyone who feels clumsy, self-conscious and unmotivated in the standard aerobics class, dance-based workout or other form of torture that requires you to learn complex steps (which, for me, is ANY steps). Leslie Sansone's walking workouts require NO fancy footwork (if you can walk, you can do these), and are amazingly enjoyable.
If the idea of simply ""walking"" leaves you wondering how on earth these can be effective or fun, take note -- the pace of the walk is brisk, probably much brisker than walking you'd do on your own outside, or on a treadmill. Also, she mixes in variations (don't worry, it's just things like sidesteps and occasional leg lifts) to keep things pumped-up, and throws in light hand weights. If, like me, you strength train every other day, I'd advise skipping the weights; if you don't, they are light enough to use every day.
You will FEEL this workout. You will sweat, your leg muscles will tingle, your energy will be way up all day. Walking is one of the best butt and leg toners around, and with this easy, enjoyable workout the time FLIES. You'll be amazed that it's over!
One other piece of advice: this workout is so easy to do that after you've done it once, you can mute the sound and play your own music to it. Another big plus, as too many workout tapes use horrifyingly bad music.",1053302400,6,1366,4.602459016393443
1685177,5,B000062XEM,"I've tried many work out tapes but the problem was that many require alot of space, alot of time, very physical movements and after a while didn't hold my attention.
I was skeptical at first about just walking to work out, but it is more than just walking.  It's a combo of easy/natural leg work (kicking), arm work, light weights, and brisk walking.  The system I ordered which has 1,2& 3 mile walk is perfect! I have a choice of what intensity I want to work out based on how fit I feel & how much time I have on my hands.  I started out with the 1 mile, which is a nice short 20mins workout. This is also perfect for those days I feel lazy & just want to do something short or those days where I don't have a lot of time & want to do something quick for the day. The movements are easy (kicks,knee lifts, hand swings, etc.)to follow (I can follow the video on my computer & watch TV at the same time)and the people they use on the video are diverse & fun to work out with. It is a perky crowd & I enjoy the light bantering Leslie has with them.
I'm also happy there are no floor exercises which require space & is just a pain to do sometimes.  I was looking for a non-jarring workout to use while I was pregnant and this system was perfect.  You can adjust your movements with the video from a  full range motion (high kicks, small kicks, use weights or no weights, etc.)or to tiny motions to fit your own physical needs.  I am very happy with the video and highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something simple & fun to use everyday. I just bought the DVD & then bought my own hand weights.",1052956800,138,1606,4.111821086261981

The steps are really basic and easy to follow - no fancy dance moves, and while the course is not especially challenging, if like me you have done very little exercise for a while, it is a fantastic starting point. It is motivating too because it is achievable - you can get through a whole workout without getting lost or too tired. Moreover, as you progress you can make the workout more challenging by modifying the steps and adding some weights. I am rarely motivated to write reviews, but this series is really working for me. However - don't get too excited about ordering the ball weights if you live overseas!...",1050451200,,919,4.411764705882353
1685179,5,B000062XEM,"This is coming from a person who is 70 lbs overweight, and I absolutely love these DVD's.  I completely skipped the 1 mile and went to the 2 mile.  I can easily do the 2 mile but I do feel the ""burn"".  It breaks me out in a light sweat and definitly raises my heart rate.  I also love that this is not just walking in place.  You do leg curls, leg lifts, a little traveling, arm moves, and other basic aerobic moves.  She also has you incorporate some light hand weights halfway through the routine and there is a mile gauge that pops up at the bottom of the screen to let you know how far you are into the mile(s).
I tried the 3 mile today and it was a definite difference between the 2 mile and 3 mile.  The two mile lasts 30 mins and the 3 mile lasts 45 mins.  By the time I finished the 3 mile, I was soaked in sweat and I felt like it was a good workout. Did I mention that this is also very low impact?  They also have one lady who modifies the moves for those people who can't get a full extention or who need easier moves.
Also in other reviews, people have complained about her ""advertising""...it is not bad at all.  She does talk about her weights at times but she also says that you can use ANY light weights, not just hers.
If you have not worked out in sometime and want to get started again, this is for you and for all body types and ages!",1049241600,14,1354,3.96309963099631
1685180,5,B000062XEM,"Thanks to reviews for the VHS version(s) of this exercise program, I bought this DVD set. I am SO aerobicly challenged, and have never liked exercise videos. I love to walk though, and decided to give this a try after reading the reviews. I've used this program four days in a row, without changing my eating habits. I FEEL the difference and felt something was happening within 24 hours. It is absolutely amazing and I used the first level the first time and the second level thereafter. I'm not even at level three yet! So now I'm going to drop the Oreo's, but frankly, my appetite has diminished a little anyway. The work-out (level 1 & 2) is fun and before you know it, it's over! It's just amazing and the fact that it's low impact is another plus. I'm a 45 year old Mom of three. This DVD has been my ANSWER to a simple indoor workout! I have my own weights, Sanson's weights don't come with this set, and plan to add ankle weights in the future. I think anyone can do the programs on these DVDs -- it's easy to follow, actually fun to do and it WORKS! UPDATE:  June 14, 2003:  I'VE LOST 10 POUNDS and I went on vacation no less!  I took the DVD with me on vacation and while I didn't do the work-out every day, I not only maintained the weight loss, but lost another pound while I was away!  I've added ankle weights to the level 2 -- it's the perfect length for a very quick, effective,low impact work-out, and also I wear wrist weights -- then add two more soft weights that I hold for the ""add the weights"" portion.  I don't even do the third level and I've dropped a complete dress size -- plus my appetite has diminished.  THE BEST EASY WORK-OUT!!",1049068800,19,1659,4.267515923566879
1685181,3,B000062XEM,"While I'm not horribly out of shape, I hadn't regularly exercised in years.  So I figured starting with the ""2 mile"" workout would be a challenge, but one I could survive.
I was right about the second part.
When I start a workout, I want something to challenge me; I like to have something to strive for.  But when I'm doing better (higher kicks, more arm movement, etc.) than even the video instructor is, and still don't get tired, it's a little discouraging.
Also discouraging is the fact that she advertises her special weights for roughly ten minutes and uses them for only 5 or so.  I didn't intend to spend money on an informercial, so it's a little disappointing to have gotten one.
I've seen many comments saying that the instructor is encouraging without being *too* perky...and I disagree.  The whole theme seems to be unity, from the way all of the actors are dressed in matching colors to the big group hug (weights in hand!) at the end of the video.  Even worse, throughout the video, Leslie keeps personally asking people for feedback on the workout (they all say it's great, of course!) and everyone giggles at every word out of her mouth.  Yuck.  Luckily it's easy enough to reach for a ""mute"" button and put on some good music instead.
Finally, I realize she's pressed on time, but she states that you should only stretch AFTER a workout -- something I've yet to hear from any fitness professional.  Then there's the fact that her ""stretching"" lasts approximately 1-minute.  Very inadequate and unsafe.
With that said, I DO have some positive things to say.  If you're looking for a short workout that will pick your heartrate up, this is the one.  If you're highly unmotivated and need a lot of positive reinforcement and perkiness, this will do it.  If you've had NO prior exercise experience and have trouble following the moves in videos, you'll love this one -- the moves are extremely basic.  It's also great if you have a very small workout area...as long as you have 2 square feet, you should be all set.
I will continue to still use this video before work in the morning when I only have 1/2 hour to exercise, or on days when I have no desire to exercise, but otherwise I'll look for more of a challenge.",1047859200,11,2231,4.575376884422111

I've tried plenty of exercise videos that had shoddy pacing, camera work, etc. This video is produced well. Leslie and her workout group are also not annoying at all. These videos are quality.
These videos seem like they would be good for anyone to try - if you are especially overweight, the moves are very low impact and extremely easy to follow. The video was actually recommended to me by friends doing the weight watchers plan. I am a former athelete (I used to run on a cross country running team)in somewhat decent shape, and with heavier weights and ankle weight, the video is challenging enough for my needs as well.  These workouts are also great for college students like me that have tiny dorm rooms - it doesn't require a lot of space at all. I haven't done the 3 mile yet but I'm certainly looking forward to it!!
