620484,3,6303217508,"I can't understand why the WWF seemed intent on pushing The Undertaker vs The Undertaker match, at the time it was huge. Looking back on it now, and you realise just how sad it really was.
Taker vs Taker has a tremendous build up, which seems to last for ages. But the match is really, really poor (2/5 maximum. Being kind. On a good day) but if you take away the final product and go by the hype and the promo then this is fantastic and really gets your blood pumping. Perhaps the hype destroyed this match. But its worth watching because its quite clever by WWF standards.
Bret Hart vs Owen Hart. Fantastic match, and the perfect culmination to a great feud. The best cage match i can recall seeing. Fantastic build up, hugely emotional encounter, WWE 2003 could learn a great deal from this feud. I was on the edge of my seat back then and i still am today.
Scott Hall (Razor Ramon) vs Diesel (Kevin Nash), the start of Nash's face turn, the beginning of the Diesel-Shawn Michaels feud which headlined Wrestlemania 11. When you think about what Hall and Nash did in WCW with the nWo its interesting to watch them fight one another. Its not a great match, but like Taker vs Taker, its interesting to see The Outsider's in a match against each other.
Lex Luger vs Tatanka. I couldn't stand either of these two, but when Tatanka goes psycho at the end i genuinely felt he made a very good heel. He beats the crap out of Luger. Basically, All American Lex Luger was meant to have 'sold out' to Ted Dibiase's Million Dollar Corp and fellow all american patriot Tatanka wanted to kick his ass. But it turns out that Tatanka was the one who 'sold out'. Not a very good match, but Tatanka was going sick on Luger's candyass. Whatever happened to Tatanka?
Mabel vs Jeff Jarrett. Mabel = very overatted wrestler, Jarrett = very underated wrestler. I thought Jeff was going to get crushed by that fat idiot Mabel. But instead Jeff kicks some ass.
I can't really be bothered with the rest. There is a very good women's match and the rest is neither here nor there. This is better than Summerslam 95, 96 and 97. But not as good as Summerslam 91, 92 or 92. Make of that what you will.",1074643200,4,2173,4.381188118811881
620485,4,6303217508,IT WAS A GOOD SHOW BUT OWEN HART AND BRET HART STOLE IT ALL.AS VINCE MCMAHON WOUND SAY WHAT A MATCH.IN OTHER MATCHS  IC MATCH  BIG DADDY COOL DIESEL  VS  RAZOR RAMON  3 STARS.

620486,4,6303217508,"This was a unique Summerslam featuring an Undertaker vs. Undertaker main event. We also got to see Bret Hart taking on his brother, Owen, in a steel cage match. Diesel took on Razor Ramon for the Intercontinental Title with Walter Payton in Ramon's corner. And Tatanka shocked the world by joining Ted Dibiase's Million $ Corporation.
This Summerslam had its highlights but wasn't nearly as good as the followin year's. We got a real good Women's Title match where Alundra Blayze faced Bull Nakano. Keep in mind that this was long before the ""Bra & Panties"" era and this was a solid wrestling match, not a celebration of T&A with Lawler obnoxiously yelling ""Puppies! Puppies!"" every five seconds.
""Summerslam 1994"" was a solidly-billed pay-per-view featuring the return of The British Bulldog, the beginning of the end of the Michaels-Diesel partnership, and a few other surprises. We also got some hilarious vignettes with Leslie Nielsen and George Kennedy.",1062288000,,958,5.10828025477707
620487,4,6303217508,"Do you remember the hitman and the rocket? Those 2 gave us the most spectacular and emotional fight two brothers can give to wrestling history.
The Undertaker came back to the wwf straight from hell to begin the new era of the darkman.
Razor Ramon ,the chico ,the bad guy, takes diesel for the intercontinental championship. Is it enough to make you understand that this summerslam was one of the most memorable in wwf history with those 3 main events?
More than those fights there was 4 other matches with luger ,tatanka and bam bam,even rikishi with the called""headshrinkers"" was there.
A 3 hours nonstop action tapes with the countdown to summerslam and the excellent the king as a commentator with oohYeah there and oohYeah that!!Excellent!!
The steel cage match with owen and bret was may be the greatest in wrestling history with the one at bad blood'97 between shawn and 'taker.

7843026,3,6303217508,"Headshrinkers VS Bam Bam Bigelow and IRS: This was an awesome match. It flowed well and could have been the best match of the night but things went south. Three managers on the outside-two for Headshrinkers and one for Bam Bam and IRS-would ruin a perfect match.

Alundra Blayze VS Bull Nakano: As with every other review ive done for wrestling says I don't watch any women wrestling. I'd rather watch lesbian porn.

Razor Ramon VS Diesel: Just like the first match. Could have been a great match but outside interference ruins the match and the ending sucked.

Tatanka VS Lex Luger: I remember this feud quite well. I loved Tatanka either as a babyface or a heel, even though WWF never did much with this guy after his heel turn. The match was decent and Tatanka's beat down afterwards was weak.

Jeff Jarrett VS Mabel: Rap VS Country, should have been crap vs crap. Mabel looks like a purple hippo in his outfit. I must admit with crappy gimmicks aside, Mabel could wrestle. Ok, the hand of the match sucked beyond belief.

Leslie Nelson and that other guy from Naked Guy does comic work looking  for Undertaker.  I'm so glad they didn't go out of buisness with all these crappy skits and gimmicks.

Owen Hart VS Bret Hart in a cage match: A classic cage match that mostly everyone should know. They don't do feuds like they use to anymore. They built up feuds and the pay off matches were great. Today it's you slapped me, we'll fight at the next ppv. I do say its nice to see Orton-Triple H feud building up to WrestleMaina 25, even though I could careless about either man.

Undertaker VS Undertaker: Once again, Summerslam has a crappy main event. They wanted to do these matches at house shows but the gimmick failed. I'm trying to research when WWF stopped doing crappy main events for Summerslam.

Overall, skip this event. The only good match was the classic Owen-Bret Hart cage match and you could get that elsewhere.",1237161600,,1928,4.578488372093023
7843027,5,6303217508,"A truly awesome pay-per-view that captured the essence of the World Wrestling Federation from that era. Everything on this tape makes you reflect with fondness on what I believe was the best time the WWF ever saw. The beginning of the tape shows footage of a special charity softball game played between the WWF Superstars and the Chicago Media All-Stars the weekend of SummerSlam. Gorilla Monsoon narrates and the footage of the actual game that was played is pretty cool. Of course, in addition to all the great matches, Coliseum Video gives fans a few of its classic Coliseum Home Video Exclusives, like right after the Diesel/Razor Ramon Intercontinental Championship match. The major wrestling buffs like myself will know that the little comments Shawn Michaels and Diesel make about each other regarding Diesel's loss added to the storyline in which HBK and Diesel inevitably split up just three months later. Also, the matches speak for themself. See the amazing Steel Cage Match between brother Bret and Owen Hart battling for the WWF Championship. This match was so good and created so many memories for Bret that he has to hold back the tears when he talks about it on his 2005 WWE DVD. All in all, if you get this tape, whether or not you are a serious collector, it will really be a bragging piece. In my opinion, the best SummerSlam ever! Easily an 11 on a scale of 1 to 10.",1176163200,2,1387,4.711934156378601
