2710174,5,B000LKAROI,"Lisa's humor is not for the PC crowd.  If you have the ability to laugh about your life, you will not be able to hold it in at this hilarious take on insulting everyone and everything.  Lisa deomonstrates that if people are truly not racist, homophobic or sexist, then they should be able to laugh at the stupidity of these insults.",1194048000,,332,4.426229508196721
2710175,1,B000LKAROI,This DVD was more about insulting the audience with racist and rude remarks.  Lisa Lampanelli has more talent than she displayed in this concert.  Do not waste your money.,1190592000,6,171,4.862068965517241
2710176,5,B000LKAROI,"Raunchy, racist, and right-on!!!  Nothing's better than Lisa's in-your-face stand-up.  She makes fun of everyone...and in the process, teaches us that we're no better than anyone else.  You MUST love her.",1188604800,,204,5.516129032258065
2710177,4,B000LKAROI,"I saw Lisa Lampanelli with a friend en we liked it a lot. Usually i don't like female stand-up comedy because the jokes are always lame. But Lisa is a hard one! She makes every racial joke there is, talking a lot against the people in the audience and also isn't embarrassed to make a foul of herself.

I thought almost 2 hours was to much but she did it en I enjoyed the whole show. Also, the extra on the DVD is super! I don't understand why they cut out this fragment of the show because its hilarious!",1178496000,,505,4.101010101010101
2710178,3,B000LKAROI,"Her previous effort ""Take It Like a Man"" is one of the funniest stand up act's I've ever seen. Unfortunately her new release ""Dirty Girl: No Protection"" is no where near as funny. It feels worn out, over played, & less of a stand up routine, but more of lets tell a bunch of the same short stories but change them up a bit. Sure there still some of the funny racial bits making fun of different audiance members, but it equals maybe 10 minutes of time on this effort.

If you don't like crude racial humour, then you're not going to like Lisa Lampanelli period & should look for a different type comedian. If you've never seen one of Lisa's special's before buy the DVD of ""Take It Like A Man"", you'll laugh until you almost cry. This effort however, is worth no more than a rental & you shouldn't expect a whole lot of hysterical material.

Buy ""Take It Like a Man"" instead & rent ""Dirty Girl: No Protection"" if you must see it.",1174435200,11,929,4.2727272727272725
2710179,2,B000LKAROI,"Oh dear what a disapointment !

 I loved lisa's first DVD but this was dull and unfunny . There didn't seem to be enough material to fill out an hour so its padded out with old old jokes and way too much crowd interaction .The queen of mean trots out the same tired racist stereotypes but does nothing to subvert them .

It all seems shopworn and tired . AVOID",1171929600,5,360,4.114285714285714
2710180,4,B000LKAROI,"Do yourself a favor and buy this dvd! I watched it first on Comedy central, and found out that they had edited out over 25 minutes of this show! Wow, they really cut out alot! Now when I bought the dvd and watched it, I liked it so much more. I was a little disapointed after seeing it on Comedy Central, feeling almost like ""that's it""? Well, the dvd is 65 minutes long, and the one on Comedy Central was 40 minutes without commercials. Do the math. Buy it! You get to see the show the way it was intended, in all its dirty,racial, fun.

I only gave it 4 stars because I think they should have included more extras, besides 1 extended scene and a photo gallery. How about Wendell's performance? Her opening act! She mentions him a few times. I would have like to see his performance, since I have never seen him before.",1170374400,9,820,4.256410256410256
2710181,4,B000LKAROI,"Very funny person not afraid to make fun of herself or anyone else, she breaks down the walls of over sensitive people and gives meaning to the saying: sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me.",1353888000,,219,4.365853658536586
2710182,5,B000LKAROI,I have many of her movies and she is SO hilarious!  If you want to laugh until you cry this is for you!,1295654400,,103,3.4782608695652173
2710183,5,B000LKAROI,"this woman always has me rolling in stitches. she will cuss, scratch and leave no subject untouched! all the things she says are so crude but you can't stop laughing. she's very raw in her comedy. as a fan of standup for years, not everyone can say they're funny. but she is on the list! nevermind the ""this one isn't as good as her first"" comments. that doesn't matter. she is funny in a very modern way which i love. she is truly unsensored and if you like adult comedy you'll love her! i'd love to see her go side by side with Robin Williams. that would sell out so fast!",1239321600,,574,4.18018018018018
2710184,1,B000LKAROI,LISA LAMPANELLI IS NOT FUNNY.  THERE'S REALLY NOTHING ELSE  TO KNOW....JUST NOT FUNNY,1237507200,3,85,5.461538461538462
2710185,4,B000LKAROI,"Coarse, profane and hilarious.  Lisa insults everyone and doesn't tiptoe around any issue.  Even if you find her language and subject matter offensive --- it is so nice to hear someone speak with no politically correct tones.",1234828800,,225,5.054054054054054
2710186,5,B000LKAROI,This dvd is hilarious. i have turned a few people on to lisa lampanelli with this dvd. maybe her fan club would have lasted more than four months had she given away these with the member package.,1227225600,,195,4.297297297297297
2710187,5,B000LKAROI,"This is the funnest woman in comedy today, she holds nothing back & nothing is above comedica insult. I received this video within days of ordering, thanks Amazon. I will consider other dvd's by Lisa Lampanelli.

2710188,4,B000LKAROI,"I bought these because I love her as a comic and she did not let me down with these two DVD's.  I listen to her on Howard Stern when she is on and wish she would be on a lot more that she is. I just happend to be in California after watching these and she was there at the community center.  If it wasn't for these DVD's, I don't think I could have ever got my wife to go watch her.  She is great live and she is great on DVD.  I highly reccommend it.",1202601600,,451,3.6666666666666665
2710189,4,B000LKAROI,we've seen her other stand-up work and this is right up there!  some new material and older material used in a new way.  if you love LL you'll love the DVD.,1199664000,,156,4.0
2710190,3,B000LKAROI,"I think a lot of Lisa's talents is in her timing and facial gestures, her Jersey Italian accent, and her overconfident expression of antiquated stereotypes. That's all part of her shtick and she does it in a way that's not genuinely offensive except to the very sensitive. But maybe because the venue was simply too large and it wasn't as easy for her to interact with her crowd, that Dirty Girl just wasn't as funny as Take It Like a Man.
It's a pity Take It Like a Man and her roasts of people like Pamela Anderson and Flava Flav have propelled her to a level of fame that she sells out huge theaters instead of the smaller nightclubs where her act excels, and where you can easily see her expressive face complementing her biting wit.",1194739200,5,737,4.426470588235294
