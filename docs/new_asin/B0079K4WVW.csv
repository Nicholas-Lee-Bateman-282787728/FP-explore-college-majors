8512857,4,B0079K4WVW,"I watch episodes 1-13 on this DVD and so far I can say that this is a really good show. It doesn't have huge action scenes, or a compelling plot(in this collection anyways) though it does introduce some good stuff in episode 8, this show is extremely entertaining, because of the comedy aspect of the show. The show can be extremely hilarious. It's only held back buy a few things, as there is some awkward fanservice and a lot of pervert characters. I do like the characters, like our mains and Minamoto of course, though Minamoto seems kind of bland if you look at his character, but let's be honest. The best character in the entire show is Hyobo Kyosuke. The man is just amazingly entertaining in every aspect. like many people, I only found out this show existed because of the spin-off The unlimited Hyobo Kyosuke/Unlimited Psychic squad. this review is more or less a work in progress, because I have yet to finish the show.",1466726400,,931,4.580838323353293

8512859,5,B0079K4WVW,"I never know what to expect when I show anime to the uninitiated.  Usually the reactions I get range from disinterest to upset at the television being used for this stuff when it could be showing action movies or something.  When I watched my Psychic Squad DVDs, my brother sat down to watch while he had his lunch.  It took him a while to finish.  He was laughing harder than I was, and a lot more often too.

As a fan, I have no complaints about this release.  The DVD set delivered exactly what I wanted:  an official disc version of the show that doesn't look like a cheap bootleg.  (Do not buy anime on ebay, ever.  I tried it once, ignoring my misgivings, and I still get grumpy every time I see the result on my shelf.)  A couple of things I should mention though.  First, the translation has some very minor inconsistencies in this first set.  The later translation actually corrected to improve understanding, but obviously no one went back to fix earlier work to match.  Second, this is a pretty barebones set.  Don't expect a wealth of posters and other junk to come with it.  Frankly, you should be happy ZKC got a DVD release at all.",1342224000,10,1146,4.390476190476191
