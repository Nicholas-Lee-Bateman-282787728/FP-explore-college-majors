I'm even a bigger fan of Nancy L-C now after watching it for the first of what I'm sure will be many, many times. Thank you! True Story: My youngest daughter (age 9) watched the first 30 minutes of the video this morning before her game against our league's previously unbeaten team. And, wouldn't you know it, she found herself matched up against the other team's top offensive player in the fourth quarter of an extremely tight and well-played game. I couldn't believe my eyes as she played the defensive game of her life both on and off the ball, completely shutting her down. More than one parent -- as well as her coach -- mentioned my daughter's defense as the key to our two-point victory. I'm going to order the companion tape on offense right now!",1042848000,,912,4.601226993865031

I use portions of her companion book to the viedo as part of my playbook and training manual  I hand out to my girls.  If you value coaching defense like I do then this  video is a must for your library.,946339200,3,335,4.26984126984127
