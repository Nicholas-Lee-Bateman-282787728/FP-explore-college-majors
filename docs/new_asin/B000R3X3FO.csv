2858334,4,B000R3X3FO,"If you are interested in this subject matter then you will enjoy and benefit from this production. I don't think it's going to bring in any lost souls due to the marginal production budget employed. Still, like the Screwtape Letters themselves, very worthwhile.",1393804800,3,261,5.093023255813954
2858335,1,B000R3X3FO,I waa expecting to see a version of the Scewtape letters this is not the screw tape letters it is a documentary on Lewis,1379980800,3,120,4.041666666666667
2858336,5,B000R3X3FO,This was supposed to be a gift for my step-mother. I don't think she's even watched it yet... But the seller did a wonderful job and I have no complaints.,1377907200,,154,4.166666666666667
2858337,2,B000R3X3FO,"We were expecting a movie, but instead this is a documentary. I didn't like it which is why I gave it two stars. However, I probably should have read the description (which I did not). So, if you like documentaries, then this may be for you. That is the only reason I gave it two stars, so I take responsibility for not liking it.",1367884800,2,330,4.171875
2858338,5,B000R3X3FO,Highly recommend this product to anyone looking for one! Arrived in said amount of time a well. Thanks and God bless!,1355702400,,117,4.619047619047619
2858339,2,B000R3X3FO,"This DVD is OK for very young believers.  But the production is horrible (corny acting, bad camera angles, awful sound).  And the points they communicate are very basic.  I wouldn't waste my time or money on this.  Reading The Screwtape Letters will be much more worth your time.",1214352000,5,279,4.75
2858340,5,B000R3X3FO,"The DVD ""Affectionately Yours, Screwtape: The Devil and C.S. Lewis"" is a contemporary review of C.S. Lewis' timeless classic, ""The Screwtape Letters"" which is based on fictional correspondence between Screwtape, a senior devil, and Wormwood, his nephew and junior apprentice. This wonderful DVD will give those who are new to The Screwtape Letters and those who are long acquainted with it a new appreciation of Lewis' allegory. The DVD includes a biography of Lewis and background for the story. It explores the Biblical, historical and cultural depictions of Satan and hell and helps us gain a deeper understanding of the nature of temptation and redemption. It discusses such difficult and theological questions as good and evil, or good versus evil, and how each person receives free will. The portrayal of Lewis in the biography and the players acting the parts of Screwtape and Wormwood help bring the story to life. Two academics and a pastor, each a Lewis scholar, give fresh insights on the subject. Sessions are divided into five units for discussion purposes. Extras include expanded interviews with Lewis and theological scholars, Questions for group discussions, PDF file of the script and Special music by Steven Bias. This is an excellent study of Lewis' book. The DVD is thoroughly enjoyable, easy to watch, and may be used as a 5-part study guide or as a documentary. Highly recommended!",1213488000,24,1404,5.135371179039302
2858341,4,B000R3X3FO,"In considering the worth of this video, one must look at the purpose and audience it was intended for.  This is directed at a church audience, and it is not for entertainment.  It is for the purpose of engendering discussion on topics such as evil, temptation, the problem of free will, what the Bible has to say about heaven and hell, how the church can become a breeding ground for corruption, how to make choices, and the question of whether good can overcome evil.

Along the way it has something to say about C.S. Lewis, his life and writings, and the influences on him in writing this gem of a book. It doesn't assume that you have read the book, but it made me get out the book to read again, years after my initial introduction to it. And I presume that others would be stimulated to read it as well.

If you want a production worthy of the local multiplex, this certainly isn't it.  But it does achieve its purpose in both informing people and stimulating discussion, and though it's a bit hokey at times, as in the echoing voice of Screwtape, well, that's forgivable. The discussion guide for small groups that comes with it is a good one too. I think that using it as a 5-part series is probably better than viewing it all at once.",1201564800,34,1242,4.406113537117904
2858342,1,B000R3X3FO,"This documentary is awful. The production values are low. The music is terrible. The ""special"" effects are hoakey. The script is unilluminating. In fact, very little attention is devoted to the book itself. It must have been made on a very low budget and was certainly put together with a minimum of talent.",1200614400,4,307,4.811320754716981
2858343,3,B000R3X3FO,"Not bad, but not great.  Would work in a Christian Education setting.  Outside of the church it might not fly far.",1188518400,4,114,4.380952380952381
8198747,1,B000R3X3FO,"Fails entirely to capture the ""aginbite of inwit"" and ""paths without signposts"" to Hell found in CS Lewis written original. Too much of marble statues floating in space, sanitized approximation to Sunday school platitudes and attempted ironing out of the subject matter to fit the flat pseudo-Christianity of empty ritual and Jesus of the Felt Board. No, not C S Lewis the revolutionary evangelist at all. This will bore and/or antagonize potential readers to death. One wonders whether Screwtape himself produced the video to deter reading the original.  Now THAT would be devilishly clever of him and consistent with his character per Lewis. If I really thought that were the case, I would give it five stars for itself being a Lewis-ian example of how the tempters of Hell work to lure you down.",1513641600,,798,4.955223880597015
8198748,5,B000R3X3FO,"This is a book you read/listen too. Think about and then read again. There are study guides available. It is an easy to read book, but really makes you think.",1513296000,,158,4.3

8198756,5,B000R3X3FO,"In an age when Dawkins and ilk merely call God names - therefore god doesn't exist, it would be wise to remember that ""sin"" is always the violation of a person (even when you pollute a person's environment). Pride and lying are tangentially connected. The father of pride and lies is anything but a cartoon with a red suit and forked tail. Lewis warned about ""scientism"" (the abuse of science) long before Dawkins was a no-show at the debates in England with Dr. William Lane Craig. Lewis is one of the most influential and clear voices of the 20th century and his insights into the problems of pain or devils is well worth your time.....mt",1399852800,4,640,4.573913043478261
