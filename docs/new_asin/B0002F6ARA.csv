The DC Video
A great start from the first indie UMD company, Silver Platter
by David Galindo

The Movie
 Trust me when I say this UMD is quite amazing, with an excellent video & audio presentation with a fantastic lineup of bonus features to boot. Silver Platter has really set the standards with their first attempt at UMDs, and that's just incredible.

The DC Video is a skateboarding film showcasing a bunch of people I've never heard of doing some fantastic skateboarding around cities and parking lots. That's the summary. Take it or leave it folks...but as a person who has never skateboarded in his life, I can honestly say there's much to be enjoyed here.

In between all the skate action (of which there are some amazing tricks and nasty spills) there's a small segment on Dyrdek Security which features Christopher ""Big Black"" Boykin who basically gets paid for being an intimidating black man (and rightly so) who helps skaters with the police, as well as a quick segment on the pain and obstacles of skateboarding as a pro sport. One Canadian gets injured so bad that his work license visa is taken away, and he's forced to stay in Canada for a couple of months with virtually no other income available for him. Not only that, but it's his fifth shoulder surgery he's had in a YEAR thanks to his skateboard.

What drives a person to hop back onto the skateboard after so much pain and injury? It's not him I wonder about, but the rest of the people I saw in the film...after all the bad spills, what gets them back onto the board? The glory of it all? Certainly if I took a face spill on cement ground I'd think twice about trying the same trick again...but these people don't give it a moment's hesitation.

Score: 9 out of 10
The Video
The movie is in a 4:3 ratio, which means you can zoom in or fill the PSP screen if you so desire. Considering the source material, the DC Video can look amazing at times on the PSP. There's some washed out sunsets hitting the streets and suburbs that looked sharp and gorgeous. The black levels are spot on perfect. This movie looks better then it should, and that's just amazing.

Score: 9 out of 10

The Audio
Well, it seems Silver Platter did their homework before putting out these UMDs, because the volume is very, VERY loud. So loud that you will absolutely not need headphones unless you have to use them. This is probably the loudest I've heard the PSP sound, and that's really saying something. Good thing too, since there aren't any subtitles.

Score: 9.5 out of 10

Extras There are two versions of the DC video: the regular bare-bones version and the deluxe DVD. In a pretty stunning move, Silver Platter chose the deluxe DVD to bring over to the UMD, and we get nearly an hour of bonus features.

How about the real bonus stuff? Exclusive to the UMD...yes, that's right. Exclusive. To. The. UMD. I never thought that day would come...but anyways, the Great Wall Jump (4:00) shows Danny Way making the jump over the Great Wall of China on a sprained ankle. Unbelievable.

Oh, and these UMDs are region 0...meaning any PSP can play them, whether it be a Japanese PSP or American PSP. Woo!

Score: 9.5 out of 10

2091997,5,B0002F6ARA,"I am an avid skater and have a couple skate vids on limewire (Baker 3, DVS skate more, Almost round three, Flip really sorry and some others) but The DC Video was not on my list. I first heard about it when my friend reccomended it to me. It was a little short but had some amazing skating in it. The switch skating in it was incredible, especially Anthony Van Engleen, Josh Kalis, Stevie Williams, and Brian Wennings parts. Lindsey Robertson, Ryan Smith, and Ryan Gallent showed there smoothness in skateboarding.

But my highest praise goes to Danny Way, amazing vert skater. Something to see if you skate.",1149033600,2,608,4.62962962962963
2091998,5,B0002F6ARA,"This is an awesome dvd!  The movie was well made, good soundtracks, had many bonus features, great tricks, and just exciting to watch.

2091999,5,B0002F6ARA,"By far the best skate film I have seen in years, if not the best skate film i have ever seen. I bought it on DVD when it came out and two days ago i bought it on UMD for the PSP and let me say if you have a PSP buy the DC VIDEO on UMD it has Danny Way jumping the Great Wall of China and a bunch of other cool bonus features, you can pick it up from a company called Silver Platter.

This video has some of the best skating I have seen in years, Stevie Williams tears it up as do all their other riders.  The skits with Big Black Rob Dyrdeks personal security guard are hilarious. This is truely a skate video like none other.",1136851200,6,626,3.7709923664122136
2092000,5,B0002F6ARA,"This video is shorter than other skate videos I've watched but it is still amazingly entertaining.  What makes this video unique is Danny Way and the gigantic ramps built by DC.  You should get the video just for that.  It shows the amazing accomplishments and endurance of today's best, while also showing how far skating has come.",1124323200,,332,4.7894736842105265

2092025,5,B0002F6ARA,"I gave five stars because I had no problems with this seller. I had done some research about skateboarding videos and from what I read this video looked good. This was a gift for nephew. Received package in perfect shape just as described online. I read it incorrectly and didn't realize it was for PSP. I needed to send back and return was not a problem at all. I was worried, thinking I might lose my money on the deal but everything went smooth and the return was correct. I recommend this seller.",1358121600,,500,4.387096774193548

2092028,2,B0002F6ARA,I bought this for my 9 year old and it was not made for a boy of that age due to the actions of the skaters.  Recommended for older teenagers.,1293494400,,142,3.7333333333333334
2092029,5,B0002F6ARA,"I gave this to my fourteen-year-old cousin for Christmas.  His mom told me he absolutely loved it and they both enjoyed watching the stunts.  He loves to watch it over and over.  Great for any skateboarder.  I was concerned it might have mature content but his mom said the songs were appropriate and there were not images that she found offensive.  She is pretty protective so if you care about that issue, rest assured.",1285372800,11,421,4.635135135135135
2092030,1,B0002F6ARA,"This is the worst skateboard or any other movie I have ever seen. The people giving this movie good reviews must be in it trying to sell DVDs.

2092044,5,B0002F6ARA,"I got this DVD 5 days ago and have watched it at least once every day.  The music goes really well with everyone's parts which makes it really easy to watch.  DC made the very wise decision of giving some skaters intros which makes the DVD pretty amusing.

Danny Way on the Mega Ramp is obviously amazing, but all of the other skating is just as compelling.",1225756800,,357,4.298507462686567
2092045,4,B0002F6ARA,"This DVD features some excellent skate footage.  However, it's not long enough (only 40 mins) and the accompanying booklet, advertised at 86 pages long, was only 8 pages.  Slight error there.  So why am I giving it 4 stars?  Because the level of skating is so good.

2092046,5,B0002F6ARA,"I just picked up the DC Video UMD and it is way cool - tons of options, lots of short exclusive videos and of course a great sountrack. This is the perfect UMD to bring along with your PSP wherever you go !!

I especially liked the segment on Danny Way jumping the Great Wall of China...very exhilarating !!",1155081600,,307,4.203389830508475
2092047,4,B0002F6ARA,"I have no idea who any of the people in this video are except for Danny Way, and I don't care.  I don't skateboard at all but play a lot of Tony Hawk on my PS2 and think this is now my favorite thing to watch on my PSP.  The great wall of China jump is amazing and the segments with Rob Big Black Boykins are hilarious.  Great UMD start to finish with tons of extras, good music and amazing video quality.",1154995200,,405,3.9146341463414633
2092048,5,B0002F6ARA,"An absolute must have for any PSP user.  The footage and sound quality will blow you away, whether you are a gamer, skateboarder or movie freak.

2092049,5,B0002F6ARA,This UMD is great for anyone who has a passion for skateboarding--great to watch on the go with the psp--and your skateboard,1154995200,3,124,4.681818181818182
2092050,5,B0002F6ARA,Danny Way is out of his mind.  His mega ramp segments are way cooler then anything you have seen anyone try on the X-Games Big Air ramp (except for this years Backflip by Danny) and I still haven't made my way through all the extras and bonus footage they have.  A must buy for any PSP owner.,1154995200,4,292,4.105263157894737
2092051,5,B0002F6ARA,"This has got to be the sickest thing I have ever seen. The Danny Way Mega Ramp segments are ridiculous.  For someone who likes a huge range of music the soundtrack rocks.  Everything from Ted Nugent and Metallica to Gangstarr and Beenie Siegal.  There are so many extras I haven't even watched them all yet.  However, the ""Hoops Commercial"" is must watch for anyone with a PSP(it is a spoof on the Tiger Woods and Mike Vick Nike commercials) and the exclusive to PSP segment with Danny Way jumping the great wall of China speaks for itself.  If you own a PSP you should buy this UMD immediately, you will not be disappointed.",1154908800,4,625,4.495575221238938
2092052,4,B0002F6ARA,"This could very well be the best UMD you will ever see. The sound is amazing, as if I'm skating alongside these extremists and the video quality is better then most of the major studio UMD's.
