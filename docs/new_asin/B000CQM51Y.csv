8100439,3,B000CQM51Y,"This is a really strange video. The instructor does not speak at all. There is a narrator, and she is often off on her cuing, so it's pretty confusing. But the warm up is really great, and really loosens me up. The ab routine is pretty standard, but it's good. I just would use this video a lot if the narrator was not so awful. It was good to watch a couple times, and now I can incorporate some of the moves in while I do other videos.",1194307200,7,437,3.977272727272727
