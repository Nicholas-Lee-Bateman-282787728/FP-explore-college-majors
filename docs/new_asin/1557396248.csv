180165,3,1557396248,"The main enjoyment this little film offers can be found in setting it in its 1940 context. Lots of messages went out to the British at this time about Keeping Mum, and Careless Talk Costs Lives. This film is designed for the same purpose, as well as to re-assure the nation that the Intelligence Service was really intelligent. Several points are worth comment. Female spies of the time were intensely beautiful, and spent nearly all of their time shimmering around in white silks and satins. This one is a real peach, and far too delicious to be a baddie. Similarly, Boris Karloff is just not the heroic British type. So this means that the mystery of the double-bluffs is doomed from the start. Never mind, it's quite fun seeing how it pans out. There are a number of interesting touches. Warner Brothers, being great supporters of FDR, make it plain that the Yanks will be Coming, even at this early date; although it took Pearl Harbour to bring about the final decision. There is a quick shot of a Zeppelin bomb being dropped on a shop called Patrick J.Ryan. Strange name. The fact that the cabinet minister's home and office both appear to be totally riddled with German spies does not inspire a lot of confidence. Still, the public knew it was hokum. It is a little disturbing, however, to learn that friendly factories and munitions dumps have to be blown up in order to fool the enemy into thinking the bloodhounds are not on to them.",1159660800,,1442,4.614785992217898
180166,3,1557396248,"Set during the last part of World War I, this spy thriller begins with the frustrations of the British military over the way the Germans seem to know their next move before they even do.  It's obvious there is a spy or leak somewhere that needs to be stopped if they are to have any success in the War.  Boris Karloff and Margaret Lindsay enter into the picture.  Individually or together, they could be British agents, German agents, or double agents, and the true identity of each is revealed at the climax.  The two spies test each other throughout the film as a plot to kill the British cabinet begins to unfold.  The film moves along briskly, with a running time of around an hour.  I have to admit that I was occasionally confused by the plot, although by the film's final moments I had figured it all out.  Karloff, limping and with a scar, is good as the more sinister (naturally) of the two agents, while Lindsay does a competent job as his female counterpart.  The last few minutes are devoted to rallying the public at the outset of World War Two when this was produced, with a poorly concealed speech about Hitler.  It's definitely heavy handed, yet it is fun to watch as a sign of the time.  Judging by the running time, the cast involved, and the production, this film was obviously intended as a 'B' picture, and as a modest little programmer, it succeeds fairly well.  Those expecting a bigger scale production will be disappointed.",1045180800,7,1448,4.552123552123552

World War1~ in the trenches war~ in the small cottage/ hut the English do not understand how all their plans are getting ""leaked"" to the Germans. The spy is listing outside the window.....and use a carrier pigeon to carry the secrets to the German Lines. A young British flyer is in a French Hospital with pretty nurse Helene (MARGARET LINDSAY) taking care of him. He falls in love with her but she ""suddenly"" disappears~ she is also a German Spy planted to collect secrets and she is awarded an ""honor"" cross of bravery from the Kaiser. Her new mission is to get to England and stay in the home of a Government official who has ""secrets"" in his safe. Helen finds that Butler Valdar~(BORIS KARLOFF) a wounded former soldier who is in reality a ""spy"" and the two of them plot to steal secrets. Valdar complete with limp and sabre scare is first rate. Lots of twist and turns and fun use of a secret code on a typewriter.  Lots of German spies including the ""milkman"".....adds to the fun and plot moves along very well. the Final Scene with Zepplin's Bombing London and yet another great plot twist keeps you entertained til the last moment. I give it 5 STARS~ Karloff at his best and lovely Margaret Lindsay is both stunning to look at and can land on her feet in any spy situation. ** THIS COPY BY PASSION* Is the best copy of this movie I have seen.

Hollywood has completely lost the ability to make terrific movies like this one. I don't want to give away too much, except to say some in this movie  are not who they appear to be.

180179,4,1557396248,"My expectations were limited as this one was included in one of those box sets of old mysteries, all of which may or may have not have slipped into public domain. Anyway I was reassured:  having Boris Karloff appearing in a movie gave it a certain imprimatur, so it couldn't be all bad.
And was I in for a happy surprise! British Intelligence is an exceptionally well crafted thriller, performed by a capable cast of familiar Brit faces of the Thirties. Karloff, as the shady butler, is the marquee performer, but the movie really belongs to the fetching Margaret Lindsay, an exceptionally good actress and very well cast here in her ambiguous role. Surprising that her career didn't really take off more. Maybe a certain lack of star power. Aside: if this story has any factual resemblance, the German agents prowling in London in WW1 seem to have been a more capable lot than their WW2 counterparts, which I understand were a study in bumbling and incompetence. I give it four stars, just barely, mostly for the taut script and Margaret Lindsay.",1426982400,,1047,4.752747252747253

This is best when watched two times since the plot is very good and moves along very fast.  Some very good special effects with Zeppelins bombing London. ** CLARIFICATION** THE BACK OF THE DVD SETS AT THE ONSET OF WORLD WAR 2 but correction we see Americans Marching into London to get to France and the trenches...and this would have been about 1917~ *** AND Margaret Lindsay has to be the BEST dressed spy ever.

180185,5,1557396248,"British Intelligence, 1940 film

The film begins in 1917 France (a bad year for the Allies). The British surprise attack was foiled, the Germans knew of their plans. Who is the spy? They will recall Williams, their cleverest agent. Who is listening outside their window? A message sent by air warns the Germans. The rescue flight is shot down in flames, but the pilot survives. In Berlin a German spy receives her reward, she will be sent to London to work for a high British government official. The Baron talks about the future! [Note his acting.] Miss Frances Audrey arrives at the Bennett mansion. Their servant Valdar greets them. Miss Audrey has a cute cover story for her stay in Germany. American troops have arrived! Thompson will leave to America. ""A fine man."" Valdar advises Audrey on proper etiquette. [No background checks?]

Valdar explains Audrey's duties. Milk is delivered in an open can, Valdar works late at night. A primitive spark gap transmitter is used to send messages. Can the Germans destroy the ammunition depot? [No defense by AA guns or fighters?] Can a typewriter send a German code? [Not likely.] Is Miss Frisdon a German agent? The police explain how Thompson's actions led to suspicion about his activities. There is another surprise! Colonel Yates has set a trap, but Audrey doesn't fall into it. How many millions have died for their country when it was only for an unworthy leader? Thompson leaves on a long trip. ""What are you doing here?"" The ministers arrive for the meeting. There is a new surprise! Zeppelins fly at night to bomb London. Can they catch Strindler? ""It worked out OK at the end."" There is a final speech about political aims and the war.

Anyone may recognize the nonsense in the final speech of Colonel Yates about ""helping humanity"", or the truth in ending a larger evil. The plot still makes a good story after seventy years, it is still worth watching. The film includes now archaic details like a coal chute, horse drawn milk wagons, candles not electric torches, etc.",1268179200,,2030,4.810888252148997
180186,4,1557396248,"I knew that this was a 'B' movie when I purchased it.  But with Boris Karloff as the lead character, I knew that this effort wasn't a total loss.  I was right!  This story had enough in it in the matter of twists and turns to force me to pay attention - the ending was quite surprising (I should tell you - but I won't!!).  The price is right!  If you want to be entertained, and don't mind 'B' movies, then may I suggest this one?

Four stars for Boris Karloff and British Intelligence!",1231632000,2,487,4.127659574468085
180187,4,1557396248,"Karloff's 1940 classic ""British Intelligence"" is a motion picture rife with World War 1 imagery portrayed by the generation who fought that epic struggle.  Although not ""sophisticated by today's standards"" this flick presents spies as agents and double agents working diligent for king and country (both English and German).  The plot, costumes, sets, and acting give this movie a turn of the 20th century feeling.

The best parts of this production are the World War 1 trench battles scenes, various bi-wingers' dogfight, a quick real-life bi-wing plane's crash, the rich man's period Rolls Royce, and dastardly Zeppelins' night bombing of London.  Wow! What a different era that was.  This movie teaches about the Great War.

The story appears paper-thin (much of its WW 2 period dialogue races to correctly condemn Adolph Hitler without saying his name) until the surprise ending- a mark of all well-done spy shows.  Karloff, as usual, is brilliant playing the mysterious leading spy.  The black and white photography only helps to add to the flick's atmosphere of espionage and mayhem.

Check this classic out, it runs a little over a hour.",1210204800,5,1144,5.140540540540541

7795895,5,1557396248,"This is a very good spy thriller with double and triple spies, acting as a spy for one country while serving another as a spy. The star, Boris Karloff, is in real life an English actor (1887-1969) whose actual name is William Henry Pratt. He is primarily remembered for his horror films. He had a noticeable lisp which he could not erase. In this film, Karloff does not play a horror demon such as Frankenstein, but a spy.
The film takes place in 1917. The Germans have many spies in England who are able to discover English secrets, their maneuvers, with the result that many English soldiers are killed. The English want to round up these spies, but more importantly, to find the master spy who is in England running the many lower level German spies.
The film was made in 1940, in the midst of World War II. The writers of the film put into the story many statements showing that England does not want war, only peace, but they must fight in order to have peace. The statements also refer to the coming of a madman who will lead Germany, a hint about Hitler.
The writing of the film and the acting is very good. The film itself is slightly grainy, but still well-worth seeing.",1512259200,3,1179,4.43778801843318
