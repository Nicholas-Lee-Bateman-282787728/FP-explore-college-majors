8011112,3,B0001EFTL0,"With the three Gundams now working togethor, they continue their efforts to protect Neotopia from the would-be invaders. However, the arrival of Captain's instructor, Gunbike, proves that this team isn't too hot on team work. On top of that, both Bakunetsumaru and Zero are both homesick.
I found this disc to be a step down from the previous one. Whilst the first six episodes had the complication of the various Gundams wanting to work solo, putting them togethor in a team brings up plenty of annoying moments. The biggest casualty is Shute. Whilst I could stand him in the early episodes, the arrival of Gunbike sees him spending all his time sitting safely in the sidecar, saying the word 'Gundam' WAY too much or making smart alec comments whilst the Gundams do all the fighting.
What is likely the 'meat' of the story this time round is a slightly deeper look at Zero's past. We learn that the princess he served was petrified and searching for a cure for her is his main drive. Of course, being SD Gundam the show doesn't dig too deeply into angst ridden drama.
After making it's arrival at the end of the last disk, the Zako Zako Hour continues and proves to be the highlight of these three episodes. In these short segments, three Zako Soldiers attempt to inform the viewers on such things as why the Dark Axis keep using Control Horns and the microscopic Bagu-Bagu. These attempts are usually hampered by everything from the Dark Axis leaders desires for more screentime to the Zako's own lack of intelligence.
If you bought the first 2 discs, it's likely you'll buy this one too. There are some good moments here and there and as said, the Zako Zako Hour is great. However, don't expect too much from this volume.",1083888000,,1725,4.659016393442623
