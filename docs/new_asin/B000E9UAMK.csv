2511462,5,B000E9UAMK,"THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN is a sci fi/horror flick that conforms to some film noir criteria: the protagonist is a victim of events beyond his control, plus much of the story unfolds in the shadows of a gloomy cellar.

The 1950s saw a proliferation of movies where atomic energy or radiation were integral to the story. In some of these, the planet's survival was at stake. In many, animals or humans were deformed or grew enormously when exposed to atomic radiation. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was the first to take an opposite approach.

SYNOPSIS--
During a leisurely ocean vacation with his wife, Scott Carey (Williams) is engulfed by a mysterious mist while Louise (Stuart) is in the boat's galley. He's covered with a glittery substance that quickly evaporates.

Six months later, Scott is accidentally sprayed with insecticide. Soon after, he begins losing height and weight. The family physician, Dr. Bramson (Schallert) is baffled by this case.  Scott is referred to specialist Dr. Silver (Bailey), who determines that radiation and poison have combined to make his body tissue, bones and organs shrink. Dr. Silver develops a serum that stops the shrinking but doesn't reverse the process.

This fix proves to be temporary-- Scott continues to get smaller. His story is publicized worldwide. When barely 3"" tall, Scott takes to living in a doll house. While Louise is out, he's attacked by the family cat and nearly killed. Scott tumbles into the basement, lands in a boxful of discarded clothes. Louise and her brother-in-law Charlie (Langton) assume the worst: that the cat has eaten Scott. News of his death goes out to the media.

Scott's uninjured, but he's now trapped in the dark cellar. Shelter, food and water become paramount. Another concern is an enormous predatory spider. Worst of all: Scott continues to shrink!

2511463,4,B000E9UAMK,"For those that have multi-region players, this might be a fine addition to their classic science fiction collection. It has, however, been released in the United States as part of a multi-disc set.

Universal has released ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" as part of a package with four other vintage Sci-Fi/Horror 50's films as ""The Classic Sci-Fi Ultimate Collection"". It's available only from Best Buy through October. I'm not sure if Universal will be releasing the titles individually (I suspect they won't). The other titles in the set are ""The Monolith Monsters"", ""Tarantula"" (both solid films), ""The Mole People"" (a cheesy 50's sci-fi movie) and the horrible ""Monster on the Campus"".

The only extras included are trailers (althoug Best Buy is offering a bonus disc of the Battlestar Galactica episode ""The Story So Far"" bundled with select copies). The art work is a bit cheesy looking (with one of the damsels in distress from ""Tarantula"" from a promo photo) with garish printing capturing the look of the posters at the time.

""Shrinking Man"" is presented for the first time in its correct aspect ratio for home video (1.78:1) while all the rest of the titles are presented in full screen. The transfer for all the films look extremely good with minimal print damage evident and some super clean up from Universal. My only disappointment is that there's no commentary track from writer Richard Matheson or, at the very least, a film historian like Universal did with their ""Frankenstein"", ""Dracula"", ""The Wolf Man"" and ""Creature"" sets.

Overwise this is a fine set. It's priced inexpensively for five movies (there's two movies per dual layered disc except the last). I picked this up primarily for ""Shrinking Man"" and the others I consider ""extras"". This is a region 1 only release so you'll have to have a region 1 player to play it (anything purchased and made in North America) or a no region player. Enjoy!",1159401600,5,1919,4.950310559006211

On a vacation, Scott Carey (Grant Williams) is exposed to a strange mist and begins to grow smaller and smaller, to his doctors' consternation and his wife's (Randy Stuart) dismay.  As the movie progresses, Carey is alienated from the human community and forced to struggle for his existence against the smallest of creatures.  The last third of the movie has no dialog, only Carey's narration.  By film's end we are treated to a meaningful and profound examination of human existence.  Sixty years later, THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN retains the ability to shock and inspire thought.  Don't miss it!",1491004800,,736,5.194915254237288

2511546,5,B000E9UAMK,"I have to say, when I first saw this movie it was in the mid 1970s. I recall it as a kid and I found it fascinating to watch as I wondered what it would be like if I were that small. I found out and it would be a nightmare. No thanks. lol Alas, we have this little 1950s Sci-Fi gem that still pleases. I had been wanting a good DVD copy of this for sometime and just recently got it at a bookstore, discounted no less. Well worth every penny! Not only does it hold up well for the time it was made, it looks good and sounds good on the Universal DVD. I have to add, that I have many Universal DVDs in my movie library and they are all outstanding!

A man (Grant Williams) and his wife (April Kent) are out on their boat one day vacationing. He sees ahead what to him looks like a mysterious mist or cloud hovering over the water and coming his way. His wife went below moments before to get an ice cold beer, leaving him alone on the dock with this cloud. The boat goes through the misty cloud and out. When it passes, it leaves the man some shimmering ""afterglow"" all over his upper body. His wife comes up from below and sees the cloud in the distance and then realizes it left her husband some residue. He thinks nothing of it and proceeds to just wipe it off. Time goes by and he notices he is getting shorter and shorter, losing weight in the process and clothes not fitting as they had before. HIs own doctor dismisses it as ordinary ""mishaps"" from incorrect documentation, etc. The days and weeks pass until he is literally inches tall. He stays in the little doll house in the living room for a time, but soon realizes that's no good as the family cat comes a prowling and attacks. His wife soon returns and finds evidence that she thinks he indeed has been killed, all the while he has retreated to the family cellar where more terror and challenges await. He eventually comes to terms with his ""shrinking"" and in time escapes the confines of the cellar to venture outside to find a whole new world and knows for himself that God, The Creator, knows he is alive and he exists, however small he may end up being.

2511560,5,B000E9UAMK,"I first saw this movie when it came out in 1957. I remember the harrowing scenes of the attack by the pet cat and of course the spider menace, but what struck me most was the sense of abandonment and betrayal experienced by the protagonist Scott Carey, and how he was menaced by things that we normally find trivial. I found the philosophical ending, in which he accepts and finds peace in his fate and still clings to his believe in a god, for whom ""there is no zero"" and his comfort that ""(he) still exists"" to be a mask for the utter grief over his ultimate isolation from other humans. I cannot watch this film without feeling sadness, especially since I learned some facts about the star Grant Williams that make the film seem like a symbolic reenactment of his own life and death.
Grant Williams remains in mystery to us in that he was a handsome and superbly gifted and sensitive actor (as well as a trained operatic singer and pianist) whose performances (those few I have seen) are permeated with a gentle vulnerability, and yet his career, after a promising start, went rapidly downhill. Aspects of his life are equally puzzling. After high school, he immediately enlisted int he air force and served 4 years, including a tour in Korea (What was the reason for this sudden leaving of his home?). After that, he enrolled in three different colleges, ending up at City College; there is no evidence as to whether or not he earned a degree. He studied with Lee Strasberg, while at the same time pursuing careers as an operatic tenor and a professional pianist; he sang at the NYC Opera during the years when his film career was at its height ( how was he able to devote time to the opera while making films?) and seemed to seesaw back and forth between music, theater, and film. His big break was the aforementioned movie, but for some reason, Universal then put him in lacklustre roles that did nothing to utilize his innate sensitivity. After being dropped by Universal, he was picked up by Warner Brothers who made a halfhearted attempt to help him revitalize his career. This too failed and he wound up making some absolutely terrible flims for independent companies. HIs TV career was uneven at best; it is said that his TV career ended because of a row with Jack Webb during a ""Dragnet 1969"" episode in which Grant appeared, but the details of this falling-out have never surfaced. He ended his career in 1976, and began his own acting school in West Hollywood, where he lived until his untimely and to me mysterious death in 1985.
Why was he stymied in his career? Why did studios initially take him on, only to reject him or give him such poor assignments?
The answer may lie in his personal life, or lack thereof.
Grant Williams was a lifelong bachelor who it is reported rarely dated (he dated 2 actresses during the period 1956-1961); from the admittedly few accounts, there is no sense of a deep attachment in either relationship. Were these datings for purely publicity reasons, or was there a more personal and poignant reason for them? I remember reading that in 1982, well after his film career was over, he was interviewed and stated that he would never accept a TV or film role again, but that if he were, the one role he would never play would be that of a homosexual,( he also vehemently denied that he was gay, when the subject of his unmarried state came up) and he cited his devout Catholicism as the reason. There was one other aspect to the interview that I remember, but I cannot find it currently online, so the reader must take this with a grain of salt. I seem to remember that he listed a set or ""requirements"" for any woman whom he would date: She would have to be very religious (presumably Catholic) and most astonishingly, she would have to be a virgin! (Again, I caution the reader to read this with skepticism.) But is this was true, it certainly would have cut off any chances for finding a female partner, unless she was a teen (and the notion of finding a teen virgin is QUITE optimistic). And then, there is the matter of his illness and death. He died in 1985 at the LA VA Hospital; the cause of death was initially toxemia (a vague term that simply means toxic substances in the blood; a blood stream infection is more properly called SEPTICEMIA) and then was amended to peritonitis (an inflammation of the abdominal membrane, which, though serious, was no longer uniformly fatal if caught in time).
By now, the reader knows where I'm going with this. I want to emphasize that as a psychoanalytic psychologist and in spite of my own sexuality, I do not subscribe to the ""gay until proven otherwise"" line. Yet, there are things in Grant Willaims' life and career disapppointments that suggest that he may have been the victim of homophobia. His leaving home after high school, erratic educational history, moving back and forth between acting and music (I think he would have been much happier had he stayed a musician),all seem to suggest a personality in flight but desparate to find a nesting ground. The unexplained rejection by the studios suggests that something about his was deemed  a liablity. HIs unmarried state and rare dating are certainly not in themselves definite signs of sexual orientation conflicts, but his rather unnecessary comment about not playing a homosexual character because of his religious convictions sounds rather defensive. And the timing or his rather mysterious death, coming as it did during the explosion of AIDS among actors..........taken altogether, well, I leave it up to the reader's own conclusions.
I will say this: I cannot view this movie without thinking about this as a parable of an actor who, for whatever the reason, led a sad, lonely, frustrated life and died prematurely and utterly alone. I don't care if anyone who reads this thiinks I'm crazy for saying this, but I grieve for Grant Willliams. Sensitivity is all too often rewarded with callousness, if not outright cruelty.",1415145600,2,5978,4.693333333333333

This film, though, has an extremely intriguing story development, excellent dialog and voice-over commentary by the main character, and an ending that may affect you on a deeply spiritual level. The split-screen scenes still look good, but the double-exposure ones don't hold up, now that blue screen techniques are used. The super-imposed figure of the shrinking man looks outlined in black.

2511574,5,B000E9UAMK,"The Incredible Shrinking Man is a 1950s B movie with an A+ premise. Like many other great science fiction films, it uses a deceptively simple concept to explore some decidedly rich territory, both narratively and thematically. In this case, the plot revolves around a man named Scott Carey who finds himself shrinking smaller and smaller due to an accidental exposure to radiation (what else, this being the 1950s). Bolstered by an intelligent script and impressive special effects (with a few dodgy ones thrown in for good measure), Scotts terrifying descent into obscurity is just as psychologically and thematically resonant as it is viscerally entertaining, and thats what makes this such a standout sci-fi film. As Scotts size diminishes, the seemingly harmless domestic world in which he lives becomes increasingly more dangerous: a pet cat becomes a threatening monster, a water heater leak becomes a dangerous flood, and an everyday basement becomes an ominous cavern. Meanwhile, Scotts voiceover invites us to ponder the existential ramifications of his plight, as the film explores themes of masculinity, hierarchical power structures, and ultimately, how we define our place in the universe. The Incredible Shrinking Man manages to ask some pretty big questions while simultaneously entertaining us with a unique survival adventure story, and thats what makes it one of the best B-movies ever created.",1406678400,8,1412,5.422727272727273

Seriously folks, 4K upconverts DVDs into near BD quality when 1) the transfer is 480p (into the 8Mbps range or higher) and 2) when the DVD is in the wide-screen format. This transfer is about as good as it gets: excellent print, high res, and in a modified ""full screen"" format so that everyone is not squished down and made too short and wide and big-headed. I will say as a word of caution I am watching on a 25"" Asus computer monitor so it may not look as good on a big-screen. As far as the film itself, it is a little ""talky"" for the first 30 minutes and I could do without Scott's little walk (well, it HAD to be little didn't it?) to the sideshow and subsequent coffee with the female midget, but everything builds up to the truly EPIC basement scenes that are, IMHO, among the very best from the 1950s era fantasy/sci-fi genre. His battle with the spider had me CRAWLING on the floor when I was a kid, twisting myself in knots trying to give Our Hero some sympathetic magical help. The whole battle is a classic and beautifully done so that even CGI-jaded youngins will be impressed. Then we come to the final scene as Scott accepts his fate and his inner monologue becomes a transcendent elegy to himself and all mankind as he crosses the boundary between the fantastically small and the fantastically large. The final 2 lines are among the most moving in the history of cinema, and you will have to watch the movie to find out what they are.

2511589,5,B000E9UAMK,"The Incredible Shrinking Man deserves to be called a ""classic movie"" in that it is still relevant and entertaining to this day. It also deserves the title Science Fiction because it gives us more than special effects and fantastical adventure. It uses Science as a springboard to provoke thought and say something about human kind's soul. That is what real Science Fiction is about.
The film's special effects are more than good enough, the acting is good to so-so, and the movie has effective adventure with giant spiders and cats; flash flooding amid everyday household items made large by the main character's shrinking malady.  What makes the film special is the script by Richard Matheson and the pensive ending added on by the director Jack Arnold that takes this Sci Fi adventure to the next level of classic film and true Science Fiction. The ending of this movie is organic, it goes where it has to go. It is also extremely creative. By the time we follow Scott Carey to the window looking out into the world, we understand his feelings and marvel at his courage as he looks at what lies in his future. It is an upbeat ending that fits. It is 1950's Science Fiction that goes beyond the aged but fun Sci Fi of its day.
The package is bare bones. No extras worth noting beside trailers, and I had no problem with the price. It is the movie I wanted to see after so many years of wondering why it was not on DVD. It is a very good movie, even after almost 60 years and that in itself is a strong recommendation.",1379376000,,1518,4.48014440433213

The viewing experience transforms as the movie transforms, at a slow and steady pace until you suddenly realize that you are contemplating your own relationship to a rapidly changing world over which you have no control.  In fact, the main character wonders if he is not some kind of freak but a representative of modern humanity--okay, it's an old black-and-white, so he actually mentions ""modern man"" but you get the point.  It is a commentary on unchecked technology, the frustration of not having the technology to solve your individual problem, self-identification, and humanity's relationship with the universe.  The ending words are timeless, as is this movie.  If you have never seen this movie, check it out.  If you have seen it before, check it out again and contemplate the intellectual/philosophical/spiritual issues that you may have missed before.

THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN is a sci fi/horror flick that conforms to some film noir criteria: the protagonist is a victim of events beyond his control, plus much of the story unfolds in the shadows of a gloomy cellar.

The 1950s saw a proliferation of movies where atomic energy or radiation were integral to the story. In some of these, the planet's survival was at stake. In many, animals or humans were deformed or grew enormously when exposed to atomic radiation. ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" was the first to take an opposite approach.

SYNOPSIS--
During a leisurely ocean vacation with his wife, Scott Carey (Williams) is engulfed by a mysterious mist and covered with a glittery substance that quickly evaporates while Louise (Stuart) is in the boat's galley.

Six months later, Scott is accidentally sprayed with insecticide. Soon after, he begins losing height and weight. The family physician, Dr. Bramson (Schallert) is baffled by this case.  Scott is referred to specialist Dr. Silver (Bailey), who determines that radiation and poison have combined to make his body tissue, bones and organs shrink. Dr. Silver develops a serum that stops the shrinking but doesn't reverse the process.

This fix proves to be temporary-- Scott continues to get smaller. His story is publicized worldwide. When barely 3"" tall, Scott takes to living in a doll house. While Louise is out, he's attacked by the family cat and nearly killed. Scott tumbles into the basement, lands in a boxful of discarded clothes. Louise and her brother-in-law Charlie (Langton) assume the worst: that the cat has eaten Scott. News of his death goes out to the media.

Scott's uninjured, but he's now trapped in the dark cellar. Shelter, food and water become paramount. Another concern is an enormous predatory spider. Worst of all: Scott continues to shrink!

Most of the movies I watched as a kid do seem some what comical by todays acting, special effects, and music standards.  This is one of the exceptions to that reason for levity.  It was a good movie then and it has held up very well.  It would take a lot to remake this movie any better.  There is good writing, narration, acting, special effects, and music.  Considering it was made in 1957 I think even a teenager today would have to agree it isn't bad.

A man is at sea when a mist envelops him and starts to shrink him.  By the time he realizes the extent he is trapped in a basement and must find his way out before he is eaten.  He uses ingenuity to make tools of what is around him to try and climb up out of danger.  He was the first MacGyver.

All jokes aside the DVD is good though it's lacking in ""extra's"" yeah I know old films generally don't have many extra's but some do have old interviews or clips of the actors something, but this disk had nothing other then scene selections & an old trailer clip, well enough about the lack of extra's the film is fun it has that flair that only classic's tend to have, & I'm happy I now have it my collection, get it & check it out if you haven't seen it, also if you have already seen it & you enjoyed the movie as I have why not add it to your DVD & blu-ray collection? well that's it if I forget anything regarding the disk leave a comment & I'll try & revise. thanks shoppers.",1375660800,2,1069,4.189320388349515

Scott Carey (Grant Williams)encounters a strange radioactive mist while laying on the deck during a leisurely boating trip.  What follows is truly incredible.  Scott begins to shrink. When he reaches the miniscule height of two inches, that's where the real fun begins.  Everything we as normal, full-sized people take for granted, takes on a whole new meaning, from the family cat who is now the size of a dinosaur to spiders and so many other common household threats. The family domicile metamorphosed into a killing field. Thought-provoking and suspenseful.  The special effects were groundbreaking in 1957 and still hold up today.  Some of the greatest moments in movie history are here. If you have seen it before, watch it again.  If you have never seen it, be ready for a real treat.  Definitely one of those movies (like Citizen Kane or The Wizard Of Oz or The Day The Earth Stood Still)that needs to be in every serious movie watcher's collection. And one of the reasons that we can look back and see when Hollywood was still making movies that were based on emotion, acting and not mindless, repetitive CGI fight-scenes and gratuitous full-frontal nudity. Very edgy stuff ala The Twilight Zone of which Matheson (Nightmare At 20,000 Feet) was a frequent contributor. Hahaha!

Maybe the greatest Sc-Fi film of the 50's, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a milestone in Sci-Fi. The story of a man, Scott Carey, who while with his wife on a cabin cruiser, runs into mysterious radioactive mist, that leaves little sprinkles of sparkling flakes all over his body. His wife down in the cabin, does not come in contact with the mist. Everything is fine for awhile, then Scott begins to shrink at an alarming rate!

""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a movie filled with ideas. The idea of the smaller you get, the less important you are. The idea of your own self worth, as the world becomes bigger & you become smaller. The idea of every day objects, situations, even pets, become an ominous & dangerous reality for Scott Carey.

""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is just filled with incredible extraordinary scenes of sheer white knuckled intensity! Among them is the pet cat, who the smaller Scott becomes, the more menacing is his beloved pet. Finally Scott becomes so small that the cat stalks him like a mouse, as he is now living in a doll house. This scene is alarmingly potent, as the cat becomes a giant hungry predator trying to get at Scott through the doll house. The viciousness of the scene is truly hair raising. Your beloved pet, becomes your worse nightmare! Another equally remarkable scene, is the struggle in the basement between Scott & what is by now, a huge Wolf spider, who is stalking Scott through a good part of the film. Scott has to devise a way, any way he can, to destroy his foe. Another terror is the simple turning on of the water heater's drain faucet, as a huge life threatening flood engulfs Scott, sweeping him towards the basement drain. Yes, mundane every day objects become huge dangerous obstacles & weapons. A pencil turns into the size of a large log. A threading needle, that is the size of a javelin in Scott's hands. Basement walls & stairs, whose heights become mountainous. Scott living in a box of wooden matches, as a shelter. Even people walking around Scott like lumbering giants, the size of Godzilla, who might smash him with a single foot step. These are just a few of the many hardships he has to face.

""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is also filled with scenes of tragic emotional loss & realization. The smaller Scott becomes, he feels that he is loosing control over his relationship with his wife. He starts to become a little tyrant, accusing her of seeing other men, demanding more attention. His wife being pushed away by his actions, but still loving him. Then he disappears, & his wife fearful & filled with remorse that the cat might have devoured him, while she was away from the house. The brother, who seems to take advantage of Scott's situation, who may want his wife? Yes, the smaller Scott becomes, the smaller he feels his importance is to not just his loved ones, but to himself, until at the end, he realizes, yes, as small as he is, he still matters, & the world is a new universe for him to explore.

Tremendous special effects for it's time, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" is a film of massively creative ingenuity, creating a giant menacing world for a man who becomes ever smaller. Director extraordinaire, Jack Arnold (The Creature From the Black Lagoon & It Came From Outer Space) is truly a pioneering director in Science Fiction! If you get a chance, watch how they made this film, truly astounding! But if anything, watch this masterpiece of Science Fiction for all it's thrill's, tragedy, & discovering self awareness of a man who thought the world forgot him, & most of all, forgot himself.",1360886400,4,3617,4.671899529042387

In total, I've only been able to play it through twice, and that after trying it on a number of different computers, some old and some brand new.

I've had similar bad experiences with the two other films I ordered in this DVD reproduction series, The Quartermass Xperiment and Burn Witch Burn.

The special effects are excellent for its time, though at times they are somewhat apparent. There are plenty of thrills and chills to delight viewers of all ages.

2511623,5,B000E9UAMK,"Finally, a stand alone US release of this terrific classic.

""Incredible Shrinking Man"" reminds me of a great episode of ""The
Twilight Zone"". It's thoughtful, well-written, and ultimately pretty
daring in its conclusions. And, indeed, Richard Matheson, who
wrote many of the best Twilight Zones, wrote the script, as well
as the novel from which it came.

Hokey at moments, with a few special efx that are pretty badly dated,
it's still tense, inventive and emotional, with good twists and turns,

It's also ultimately very thought-provoking, and raises some interesting
(and vaguely Buddhist) ideas about the meaninglessness of size in the
vastness of the universe.

This film could be the poster child for what's now called by Hollywood a 'smart genre film' i.e.
it can be advertised as a genre movie (horror, action, sci-fi, etc.) but transcends the
limitations usually associated with that genre to become a special, well-made film that can
speak to a grown-up audience beyond those simply looking for a cheap thrill.

My only disappointment was the complete lack of extras (other than the trailer)

very interesting to hear how the effects were created, how the deeper themes were
addressed, etc.",1345248000,3,1278,5.154589371980676

2511625,3,B000E9UAMK,"I haven't read all the customer reviews of this DVD yet, but I have to agree whole-heartedly with those I did read. The film's ""message"" is beautifully rendered. The special effects are a bit weak, though for 1957 they're good. However, when the tiny man runs across the basement floor, there's no shadow, no sense of actually being there. Certainly the over-sized props work...but then that's nothing new to Hollywood. Laurel & Hardy played with this concept when they played their own children in a short called BRATS. The scene where the cat is trying to get at our hero through the windows of the doll's house is weak because of the focus. Rear-screen projection NEVER works! Also, from when I read this as a kid I have always remembered the concept that when the tiny, almost insect-sized man falls a great distance, he isn't harmed because the smaller you get, the less likely you are to be injured in a fall. That isn't mentioned in the film anywhere. I sort of missed it!

But what's really annoying, as other reviewers have pointed out, is the total lack of bonus features (other than a trailer). I felt cheated, because this movie, as much as IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA, which I bought from Amazon and watched a couple of nights ago, demands a commentary track if not a making-of documentary. IT CAME FROM BENEATH THE SEA is in a 2-disc edition, with a whole second disc devoted to discussions of the effects and how they were accomplished. This sort of thing fascinates me.

So I give this three stars. It deserves more and certainly would have had a full five if they'd provided bonus material. But at least we have the movie now, not just a part of an anthology, which is the only version available until recently.",1335312000,5,1729,4.592233009708738
2511626,5,B000E9UAMK,"When people think of 50s sci-fi they usually think of the Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet and Them. But there is another movie which gets short shrift probably because it's not on tv and only recently been released on DVD as a stand alone. And all I have to say are the magic words  Richard Matheson. He wrote the screenplay based on his own book, The Shrinking Man. Who is Matheson? Let us now our heads to the greatest sci-fi/fantasy writer of the 20th century. Jules Verne and H.G.Wells were masters of what I call the gee whiz style of sci-fi. This is the style one can describe as boys and their toys. Technology and how it affects the future. Matheson is the master of pyschological sci-fi, in a sense the more mature and much harder to write style. He isn't concerned with how it works only with the effect on humanity. Matheson wrote many episodes of the Twilight Zone, including the famous Nightmare at 20,000 Feet. He also wrote the original Kolchack the Night Stalker TV movie and Steven Spielberg's first TV movie, Duel. And if that isn't enough he wrote I am Legend (butchered by Will Smith) and the Twilight Zone episode about battling boxing robots.....sound familiar?
The Incredible Shrinking Man is about Scott Carey, a man caught in atomic fallout which makes him shrink to nothingness. This is an existentialist movie about the meaning of what you are in big picture of the cosmos. At the same time it's a pretty exciting movie about shrinking! The backscreen effects are bad by today's standards but the use of oversize props are fantastic. The last third of the movie is basically a man trapped on an island except it's the basement of his own house when he's so small he can't escape. Here is some voice over dialogue, as it works better than anything I can describe:

""The cellar stretched before me like some vast primeval plain, empty of life, littered with the relics of a vanished race. No desert island castaway ever faced so bleak a prospect.""
""A strange calm possessed me. I thought more clearly than I had ever thought before - as if my mind were bathed in a brilliant light. I recognized that part of my illness was rooted in hunger, and I remembered the food on the shelf, the cake thredded with spider web. I no longer felt hatred for the spider. Like myself it struggled blindly for the means to live.""

When is the last time you heard stuff like that in any movie, let alone a low budget sci-fi movie?

Watch this movie and think of it as precursor to the Twilight Zone in tone and style. It will leave you thinking long after that 3D travesty with the blue aliens is a relic.",1329955200,9,2624,4.529535864978903

Exposed to a strange radiation cloud at sea, after having been exposed to an insecticide, he starts to shrink.  At first he only notices that his shirts are a bit too loose....but when his cat is the size of a whale, it's not too hard for him to figure out he's in deep kimshe.

2511638,4,B000E9UAMK,"This is one of those films I had to see as a kid.  The protagonist was handsome, it had terrifying details in a normal house, and the effects looked believably horrific.  I even got a paperback version of it, which was superlatively written, in the same style as the internal dialogue of the shrinking man.  I had to see it again.

OK, as a 50s film, it is the magic of radiation at the base of it.  A couple are on a sail boat trip, the husband is outside and caught in a strange mist though his wife isn't.  Upon their return home, he notices that he is losing weight.  The doctor confirms this and that he is getting smaller, which the couple suspected.  As the process continues, the house cat attacks him and he escapes, and yet is trapped in, the basement.  There, as he searches for food and continues to shrink, he finds a horrifying new adversary, a spider.

What distinguishes this film is the dialogue the man has with himself.  He finds his masculinity compromised and takes a lot of it out on his wife, but then he turns to survival and the reasons he is trying to live, all while he appears doomed to disappear.  His plight is completely believable, and his thinking evolves from rage to survival to a kind of transcendence.  There is a horrible scene where his wife, who thinks the cat got him, comes into the basement to de-block a drain and fails to hear him as he screams for help, holding onto a pencil to avoid being sucked into the drain.  He also contemplates letting the spider get him, a hideous death, but quick.  THen, in a moment of triumph, he achieves a kind of peace with himself, finds his place in the universe and its mysteries.

This is really great scifi.  It has lived in my imagination for almost 50 years and seeing again was not at all disappointing.  Warmly recommended.",1308355200,63,1810,4.4169184290030215

2511642,5,B000E9UAMK,"I am amazed this movie is not available by itself - rather than packaged with a bunch of lessser Sci Fi grindhouse movies from the 1950s.

It and ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" are the supreme trilogy of 1950s Sci Fi.

In 2009, ISM was named to the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant and will be preserved for all time.

The Incredible Shrinking Man towers above any remakes or take offs for two main reasons. The most convincing special effects possible (most everything was real physical objects - no digital - from a huge mouse trap to a match box big enough to live in) and story you may NEVER forget.

It is way more than a story of a ""shrinking man"". It is the story of a man who discovers a truth we all seek. An indefinable truth - the one way down in your heart - deep inside....

He discovers it through heartbreak, losing all those he loves and cares about, suffering incredible indignity and physical pain, even having his beloved pet turn on him and see him as nothing as a piece of meat.

But through survival - he discovers something very amazing... A common thread in all creatures and humanity.

In the end our shrinking man is as large as anyone can possibly be. A true ""expanding man"".

In my opinion Grant Willams performance is Oscar worthy. He really knocks it out of the park and leaves you absolutely convinced that all this is really happening to him

2511643,5,B000E9UAMK,"I saw this movie, ""THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN"", years ago on TV, and still remember it fondly.  For a horror movie, it had pretty good acting, and a really good script, story-line and direction....

After being exposed to a mysterious mist, our hero begins to shrink.  Soon he is dodging the family cat, (and spiders!)  The people he goes to for help, are ultimately powerless to help him.  The ending is
surprisingly literate....almost Biblically-based.....timeless and univeral....

I thought of this movie, much later, when I watched one particular episode of the series, ""Bewitched"".  I forgot what the episode was called, but Darrin, (Dick York), was called a ""little man"", by Endora, (Agnes Moorehead) -- and soon, Endora decided to MAKE him a ""little man"" -- quite actually!  The scene where Darrin has to quickly drive home, (""...while my feet can still reach the pedals""), and the quickly-shrinking Darren, (wearing a hat that by now almost completely covered his head nd face), running across the lawn into his house, is unforgettable.

As is ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" -- the much more somber, theatricral movie which, I belive, inspired the 'Bewitched' episode.  The move does have some humourous moments -- but is generally somber, and far more well-written than most sci-fi films of that, (or any other), era.

And NO -- this movie, ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", is NOT about how taxes and inflation are making ""ordinary"" people -- the ""little"" people of the middle and lower economic classes, even more ""little"" today, SHRINK, (at least in their net worths).  Nor is it about someone undergoing in-depth analysis with a psychaitrist, (commonly called ""a shrink""...one who shrinks his patients' egos to become more ""realistic"", and some say, more sadly deflated).  This movie is a story about one man who encounters a strange mist, andhas his destiny changed, because of it.  Oddly, there is more to this story than just that. The story of this movie stays, and stays with one.  There is a definite moral, I think, in this story. Again, I am sure it is Biblically based.
