8430970,5,B004INXCY6,"I am assuming that I would love this Israeli version based on the fact that I loved the American version.
I write this to plead that Betipul 1 and 2 be released on Zone 1 version with English subtitles.
Thank you.",1454025600,6,213,4.219512195121951
8430971,5,B004INXCY6,"I really like In Treatment, the Israeli version, I only wish I could find Season 1 with english subtitles somewhere!",1423008000,2,116,4.85
8430972,5,B004INXCY6,"The Israeli original BeTipul is quite different from ""In Treatment.""  At least the second season is.  I have not be able to find a version of the first season with subtitles.

The American version is more dramatic and the personalities more twisted.  The Israeli original is more solid, straightforward.  The Israeli psychologist is a quiet tower of strength; the American counterpart is angry and scared, like his patients.

Some of the themes are different too.  I understand that in Israel having children is much more important than in the United States.  Thus the lawyer character in the Israeli version is obsessed with having children.  In the American version, her obsession is with sex and finding a man.

Another difference is that the daughter of the CEO character is a lesbian, and has trouble telling her father about it.  In America being gay is not a big deal anymore, so that theme was dropped.

If you enjoyed In Treatment, try to see the Israeli original, beTipul, as well.

And if you have a version of season 1 with subtitles, please let me know.",1409443200,7,1066,4.791208791208791

8430974,5,B004INXCY6,"A brilliant series with extraordinary acting and highly intelligent script. One of the best series I have seen. Even if you do not think much of psychotherapy, the characterisation and the dynamics between the hero and each of his patients are of a quality of a classic novel. It is a great pity that the first series in the Israeli version are not available in English subtitles.",1407801600,,380,4.686567164179104
8430975,5,B004INXCY6,"Anybody who has had anything to do with therapy or counceling wil recognise themselves here. Fascinating, moving and sometimes painful and disturbing.",1334361600,6,150,5.863636363636363
