8167952,5,B0001AFSZG,"I grew up on the music of Miller, the Dorsey's and other Big Bands. This wa a showcase for many of Miller's recordings. It was enhanced by three of the original Miller artists: Tex Beneke (Who I met in person), Johnny Desmond and Marion Hutton. The other singers tried but didn't really live up to the Miller music standards. It was a trip down memory lane for me. I loved it except for the mentioned doubts.
