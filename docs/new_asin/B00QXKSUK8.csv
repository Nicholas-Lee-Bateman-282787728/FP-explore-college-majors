8693248,5,B00QXKSUK8,The absolute best examination of the relationship between God and science that I have ever been privileged to encounter. I bought this copy for my magnificent son to edify the many conversations we have had on the subject.,1513123200,,222,4.868421052631579
8693249,4,B00QXKSUK8,"First couple of DVD's were very good and ""the Big Bang Theory"" was presented in a way that I found to be understandable and compelling.  The presentation started to fade with DVD 3 and I found DVD 4 to be more of a sales pitch for a book and other items to purchase.  Overall, I  found the topic extremely interesting and would therefore recommend the DVD package to those with an interest in a discussion of ""what came first"".",1433635200,,427,4.379746835443038
