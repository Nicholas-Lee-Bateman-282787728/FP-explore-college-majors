5091622,3,B007JMG4P2,While this brought back memories of living in the lovely Monterey Bay area it was too slow paced to watch while spinning so it got a bit...boring!  I like to go fast when I ride!  Some camera work was a bit shaky - sudden large pans which made me have to close my eyes - and seemed out of focus at times.  Might be more enjoyable if you are on a treadmill.,1358380800,3,356,3.9166666666666665
5091623,3,B007JMG4P2,"It had beautiful scenery and was nice and long for an effective and lengthy workout on the treadmill - the video was a bit unsteady at times, but all in all very good. I do have an IFit equipped treadmill, not with the tv screen. So I compensate by using my laptop. I start the treadmill, activiate active workout on IFit, pop in the DVD and set my laptop on top of the treadmill. I also use external speakers for the laptop so I can crank up the nature sounds. Feels like you are actually out and about in nature.",1354492800,,514,4.15
5091624,5,B007JMG4P2,"As promised, this video provides a beautiful scenic view of the California Coast. I am very familiar with the areas covered, having grown up in California. I have driven Scenic Highway 1 and the areas around Carmel and Pebble Beach many times. I love seeing this rugged area through someone else's eyes. Really couldn't have found a better video to workout to. It transports me from my hectic day to a peaceful state of mind and a feeling of well being.",1337731200,,453,4.604938271604938
5091625,5,B007JMG4P2,"I got this for my wife, she's always talking about taking a trip out to Carmel. I found myself looking over her shoulder at it and soon I was working out with it too. The scenery was stunning. Plenty of ocean, cliffs and trees. For me the pacing was just right- not too fast, not too slow. And I like how it went over rugged terrain and beautiful trails. Sometimes I use my own music if I want to speed up- because it seems to me the music really sets the pace. We also like the Yosemite workout as well. Good product, decent price.",1334016000,,532,4.125
5091626,2,B007JMG4P2,I down loaded this video from amazon instant video thinking I would use this with my stationary bike but it has poor video  quality and went very slow.  Slower than a walking pace.  There was no preview clip.  If there had been I wouldn't have bought it,1333756800,,253,4.319148936170213

8518403,2,B007JMG4P2,"The repetitive loop of the same dull electronic music for 40 minutes nearly did me in.  The scenes are pretty, but the not quite smooth movement of the camera gave me a touch of motion sickness.  I'm not a hard core exerciser, but this one just didn't work for me.",1502323200,,264,4.26
8518404,4,B007JMG4P2,Makes my time on the treadmill go by much faster and the scenery is great!,1426636800,,74,4.0
8518405,1,B007JMG4P2,Way too slow for running or even a normal walking pace.  Waste of money.,1420761600,,72,4.142857142857143
8518406,3,B007JMG4P2,The musical beat is a bit slow all in all and the scenery is rather repetitive.  The POV is sometimes a bit off at times.,1391126400,,121,3.84
8518407,5,B007JMG4P2,"Gorgeous, rugged scenery. I viewed it while on my treadmill and elliptical machine. There area plenty of areas to dial up the resistance to a high level so you get the effect of climbing those rugged, rocky hills. These aren't pebblestone kinds of paths. There are places where you have to be careful or you could fall off cliffs onto the rocks or into the ocean. The variety in the scenery made my exercise time just fly by. Anyone who loves Big Sur, Carmel, Pacific Grove, and the Monterey Coast in general will love this video, whether you just watch it for the scenery or use it for exercise inspiration. I recommend it highly!",1384732800,,631,4.543859649122807
8518408,3,B007JMG4P2,"This one is ok. Scenery isn't my favorite, and I'm a California girl, but it still feels like you are on a real trail run.",1384128000,,122,3.92
8518409,1,B007JMG4P2,"Almost purchased because I have a similar  ipad app that I love but I have watched it so much thought I would try something new.  Very disapointed!  The music and filming are too slow to run to.  It states ""briskly for running biking or hiking"".  It is far from briskly filmed.  I found my self jogging slower and slower so in the end I just had to shut it off.  Too slow for even a brisk walk....more like a crawl.  Glad I only rented it instead of bought so I only wasted 1.99.  Could be used for scenic relaxation or to help you go to sleep for it is beautiful and the music is soothing.",1377734400,3,590,4.060869565217391
8518410,3,B007JMG4P2,"Very nice scenery but it's slow, we have such a wonderful coast in California. Sure did choose some nice places to share!",1361923200,,121,4.545454545454546
8518411,2,B007JMG4P2,"I had rented this video with the intention of using it to get the feeling of walking outside while walking on my treadmill.  Although the scenery is beautiful, the person shooting it walks at a VERY slow pace and I didn't get the feeling I was working out at all.  I walk on the treadmill at  speeds of approx 3 - 3.5 mph, but the pace of the video is approx 1.5 - 2 mph ....very slow.  So I was quite dissapointed and feel the name of the video is very deceiving.  I wish they would come out with videos that list the speed of the walker shooting the video or what level this is intended for.  I would rate it as an entry level leisure walk.",1359504000,5,642,4.015748031496063
