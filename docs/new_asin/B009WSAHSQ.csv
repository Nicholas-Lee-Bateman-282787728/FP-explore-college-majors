8544723,1,B009WSAHSQ,"I bought this and volumes 1-3 for my dad who's a Boston Blackie fan.  Unfortunately, the quality of the video is poor.  It is likely a public domain copy dubbed to disc.  It's not restored or improved in any way and it's not uncommon for the DVD to just stop and start.  It could be the player, but the fact the picture quality is so poor, it's not worth the viewing.",1359936000,,367,4.126760563380282
8544724,5,B009WSAHSQ,"Boston Blackie defined cool long before Robert Michum in Thunder Road and Steve McQueen a generation later. With his dog Whitey (in some episodes) and girlfriend Mary and always driving a full custom convertible, he cruises greater LA and invariably saves the day. A great period piece.",1358812800,,286,5.1063829787234045
