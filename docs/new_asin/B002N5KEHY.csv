3955381,4,B002N5KEHY,"I love the adventures and this show makes the music fun.  It will inspire you to learn to play an instrument.  It also introduces you to real people during that time period.  I.man age 11.

Mom's review:  I do love this series.  it has been entertaining and educational for all my children ages 2-11.  They recognize his music now when played elsewhere.  The series also has short segments in each episode that will engagingly explain more about an instrument that was used or musical term mentioned.  Segments of Austria and important people & places during Mozart's time as well as Austria in modern day are  also shown and explained.  As a homeschool mom, there is a cd-rom that is included in the set that provides lesson plans based on each episode.  They are well crafted and can easily be used for young and middle elementary aged students.  I do have to agree with another reviewer that there are some instances of cheating and other mild infractions that are never addressed  the use of words like stupid and idiot are sprinkled here and there.  But all in all, I find it an entertaining way to learn about Mozart, his time, & his music.",1263686400,5,1146,4.603960396039604
3955382,4,B002N5KEHY,"""We have been watching the DVD series ""Little Amadeus"".  We are learning about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  We like that the stories are funny, but they tell us real details about his life.  Amadeus was an adventurous little boy and he sometimes got into trouble.  We learned that the Mozart family were musicians, but that Amadeus was a musical genius.  Amadeus was composing music at 8 years old!  That is amazing!  We are learning about different musical instruments that he played and used in his music.  It's neat to be able to listen to the radio and to hear his music playing.""

I have enjoyed ""listening"" to the DVD's while in the car.  The kids find them interesting and actually ask if they can watch them. I like that there is factual information and enjoy the original compositions that are played throughout the episodes. However, it is sometimes difficult to know what the factual details are and which ones are just making a funny story.  I have not done a ton of research on the Mozart family, so when the kids ask if something really happened I can not say for sure.  Guess I need to study up!  Also, for those with younger viewers, the words ""stupid"" and ""idiot"" are used several times. And for parents with older children, there are some thematic elements that I had to discuss after viewing  (cheating on school work with no repercussion, mild bullying) There was a villain throughout the series, who, in the end, always failed to accomplish what he wanted. I found him to be pretty harmless...creative, but harmless.  All in all, this series is a great investment for a bit of Music Appreciation and Music History.  The set actually includes student pages and classroom activities which were a great compliment to the DVD's.  I recommend the series highly, but be prepared to know your facts...your kids just might ask you!

3955394,1,B002N5KEHY,"As an elementary music teacher I thought that this would be a perfect show for my students, especially when discussing Mozart. Here is my issue, the language is too rough, with ""idiot"" and ""stupid"" floating around, for my younger students and the older students find it incredibly boring, especially at about 45 minutes an episode. Maybe fit for second or third grade but I am shocked that they went through all of this effort to appeal to young people and then they didn't censor themselves.",1419120000,5,492,4.8

3955397,2,B002N5KEHY,This show was too difficult for very young children and frankly too boring for the older ones.  the animation is poor and the music is not important enough.,1398038400,2,156,4.571428571428571
3955398,4,B002N5KEHY,I bought this to improve my German. Watching this in German is great but it would help me if I could use English sub-titles while watching in German.,1395619200,,149,4.357142857142857

3955401,5,B002N5KEHY,"This German Series has, rightly, won numerous accolades for its portrayal of the child prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. He is charming, sometimes mischievous, has his antagonists, but is immensely gifted in musical abilities. In other words, according to virtually all of Mozart's biographers -pretty much how he was in real life.

While Europeans accept that and it makes for an always entertaining series, some homegrown reviewers and audience members see that as ""politically and socially incorrect"" for children. Only, every child I have seen this with, including my own children, are entertained, educated and (best yet) inspired, because they never find it boring. My children have watched this repeatedly-so much so that I will soon be ordering a second copy.

Yes, Little Amadeus has an antagonist and every good children's movie does have one. Where would Little Mermaid be without Ursula? Or Snow White without her Queen? Or Dumbo without his naysayers? Being aware of obstacles to overcome prepares children for life.

Only, in addition to being animation, this is ""classical music"" and we American suburbanites want both to be ""proper"" aka ""dull.""

Naturally, if it was dull, children would not watch it. That fact eludes the complaints from some of the PC educators/parents here. It reminds me of a South Park episode (which is NOT for children, including my own) that I happened to see at a work Christmas Party. The school board, town board, and parents all found something to be offended by in a local Christmas pageant. The committee, hovering over its town children like a suffocating mother hen, chose a dry, minimalist composer to play music for the event. It was the only thing they could all agree upon without someone taking offense or feeling it was ""harmful"" to the kids. Upon the unveiling, all the kids found it a hopeless bore, with all the joy and life sucked out of it. So the children, predictably, walked out. No kidding. And we wonder why classical music is dead here in the states? Hint: It's not dead overseas so, perhaps we should look at that and see why. ""Little Amadeus"" is a great start.",1385164800,3,2127,4.949579831932773

All that watch it get a taste for music, and it is very encouraging for little musicians!  To be sincere, everything of Little Amadeus is Educational, the producers know what they do. I have been watching it for years now, and I would really recommend buying it! Worth every penny!",1360022400,2,404,4.690140845070423

3955406,4,B002N5KEHY,"I am happy with the quality of the DVDs and they do make learning fun. Really the reason I purchased these was because I wanted my daughter to be able to watch cartoons in both English and German which this provided. The English version however does use a bit of name calling (idiot, stupid, etc.). I prefer the German version but overall it's still a good show for what I wanted. My daughter knows better than to use those types of words anyway so it isn't too much of a big deal, but I still don't like hearing them so we mostly stick to the German side of things. The theme song is very fun and the plots are generally pretty good as well. I would buy this item again.",1336003200,,671,4.1692307692307695
3955407,3,B002N5KEHY,"I ordered these DVDs since they have subtitles, which I need for the group I planned to use these with.  Amazon clearly stated there were subtitles in all four language on their product description when I ordered these on 1-22-12.  They arrived today, just two days before Mozart's birthday, the day on which I had planned to use them.  There are no subtitles in any language, rendering them unusable for me.  This has happened to me before with Amazon product descriptions.  They really need to get this right out of respect to the hearing impaired.",1327449600,11,550,4.747368421052632

3955409,5,B002N5KEHY,Here is a wonderful way to introduce children to the great music of W.A.Mozart with really fun stories about life in those times. Lots of made up but children love this series. Our 6 year old watches them as a reward for good behavior! ENJOY!,1295395200,2,242,4.4
3955410,3,B002N5KEHY,"Because of the recommendations here based on this series' educational value, I bought a set thinking to give it to children of my relatives.  But I have decided not to do so.

I applaud the educational opportunities which have been cited here.  But I don't like some aspects of how Mozart's story has been adapted to what are apparently Saturday morning cartoon conventions, which often include folktale motifs.

I think it's great to feature a child hero who's ""magic"" powers are his musical gifts. But I don't like how the series designed the apparently obligatory villain.  An adult whose jealousy of little Mozart's gifts leads him, in the episodes I watched, to push his untalented nephew to the fore as a rival. A rival who, of course, will always be bested by prodigiously talented little Mozart.

It is true that, again in the episodes I watched, little Mozart does not seem to lord it over his less-talented peer.  But I was still uncomfortable with this kind of adult-induced rivalry in children.  It seems to me there is enough of this coming from adults in the bleachers at children's athletic events.

I do not object to competitive events for children.  But prefer that the competitors be more evenly matched, so that one isn't always the loser.  Wisely, we don't have baseball games between kindergartners and middle schoolers.

In addition, the way the villain uses his nephew seems psychologically abusive to me.  And I am led to think that perhaps slapstick physical violence in cartoons is in the end preferable to this kind of psychological abuse.

After expressing my reservations to her, I lent the set to a friend who has preschool children.  She returned it saying her kindergarten daughter found the villain too frightening.  Which in my book is a mark of her good taste.

I am aware that I am likely expressing a minority opinion here, as apparently other viewers have not been similarly bothered.  Or may think that the series benefits outweighs this weakness.  And may even find it profitable to discuss these plot elements with their children.

But there may be some out there who would like to have these plot elements pointed out before they invest a considerable amount of money on the set.",1288742400,34,2222,4.843501326259947
3955411,5,B002N5KEHY,"We've incorporated the Little Amadeus series into our homeschooling program, and my 6 year old is thoroughly enjoying it.  The set comes with complete lesson plans on a CD-Rom, one per episode, and by adapting those for individual use we've both learned a lot about Mozart's music and life and times.  Well worth the money!  [I wonder if Season 2 will be available soon, or is it already out there?...]",1286236800,5,402,4.714285714285714
3955412,5,B002N5KEHY,"My 6 year old son loves this cartoons a lot and watches them all the time.  At least it is keeping him off the Nickelodeon, CN, Disney, and other non-PBS cartoon channels.  In addition he knows a lot of the music of Amadeus, life and times in Austria/Vienna, his major compositions, musical instruments, his family, and yes he loves to watch Pimperl.  This is also helping him motivate to practice his piano lessons.",1280534400,,416,4.671232876712328

There are extensive lesson plans for each episode and the National standards are listed for reference. It is great for a substitute to impliment and the comprehensive questions for each episode are thought provoking for the students. I just wish two things: 1. That the second season was available in English  (I've only found it in German to purchase), and 2. That the website was still up and running with the resources and activities that the lessons refer to available to use with the classes\students. The students are so interested in this series because it is based in a time they know little about, and it is nothing they've ever seen before.

Very cartoon-ish in plot and deviates very far from Mozart's life in order to consider this biographical with few musical educational moments.
