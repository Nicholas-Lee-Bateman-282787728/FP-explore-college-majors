3454573,5,B001AMHNKW,"The complicated events following the 2000 election are dramatized with flair and accuracy (to the best of my knowledge) in this very worthwhile, if depressing film.  The pace of the film is intense and the acting is consistently good; I especially enjoyed Laura Dern's portrayal of Katherine Harris.  It is important for people not to forget this truly nauseating rift in the fabric of American democracy, to appreciate the potential weaknesses of our election procedures, and to continue to fight for the principle that every vote should be counted.",1220745600,2,550,5.168539325842697
3454574,5,B001AMHNKW,"We all know the outcome of the 2000 Presidential race so why would you want to watch this HBO made for TV movie? Like watching a movie about a sporting event or athlete where you know the end, it's about the game itself. This film is about the Florida recount in 2000 as seen mainly through the person of Ron Klain, Al Gore's former Chief of Staff who was dispatched to Florida to head up the Democratic team pursuing the recount. The acting is terrific and so is the writing. Since the event is so recent and all the players are still living, getting the story straight was important and it seems that they did. Even knowing the ending, this movie draws you in so that you almost forget what happened as you follow the events and drama within the inner circle of each party as they fight for Florida's 25 electoral votes and the Presidency. It's really a story about democracy and how it does and doesn't work, about our legal system and how it does and doesn't work and whether a Republic like ours can survive a crisis like that. Whether you think the system works, depends, of course, on what side you were on but our country did survive and I think some credit must be given to the parties involved, particularly Al Gore as the underdog, who could have gotten their supporters all riled up and created a very ugly situation. There were hardly any demonstrations by Democrats. Gore also called off the pursuit in the end when he could have continued to the further detriment of the country. It seems that there was a tangible case of 'Country First'. It is also a reminder that we still don't have this voting thing figured out in our country. We can put the proverbial man or woman on the moon but can't develop a consistent, reliable national voting system for national elections. Maybe there's a case for letting each state and precinct determine its own way, but in an election that affects every one of us, I'd like to think we were all playing by the same rules. This is another outstanding docudrama by HBO. Enjoy during this election year. Who knows, maybe it will be deja vu all over again. [...]",1220659200,3,2109,4.48051948051948
3454575,1,B001AMHNKW,"More time wasted complaining about what was simply a loss. When liberals do not get what they want, there is always some conspiracy.

Recount served one good purpose; It gave a good reason to drop HBO.",1217808000,19,201,4.583333333333333
3454576,5,B001AMHNKW,"""Recount"" is a brilliant docu-drama using actors and lots of real television footage to encapsulate the 2000 election fiasco in which George W. Bush was given the Presidency by a 5 to 4 vote by the Supreme Court of the United States in an unprecedented intervention in a presidential election recount.
 I was a resident of Florida during this fateful period in American history, and it was an embarrassing and enlightening moment for Florida voters.
 Kevin Spacey does a superb acting job portraying the point man for the Gore recount in the Sunshine State. Ex-Secretary of State Jim Baker played smart hardball for the Republican cause while ex-Secretary of State Warren Christopher proved how gutless, prim, proper, and pitiful he was as Gore's first leader in the recount. Joe Lieberman, Gore's vice-presidential running mate, helped to undermine the Gore recount.
 The deck was stacked against Gore by Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris (with a devastating portrayal by Laura Dern) and by Governor Jeb Bush. They had laid the groundwork for a Republican victory. Gore nationwide won the popular vote by a half million votes, but in Florida there were improper vote counting, all kinds of screw-ups, poorly designed ballots, undercounting, and the disqualification of thousands who were turned away from the polls because their names were incorrectly placed on a felons' list.
 Does this movie make a compelling case that an election was stolen? Yes. Is the movie biased in favor of the Gore faction? Yes. Should the Democrats have been more
aggressive and fought harder, earlier in the recount? Yes. Should Gore himself have gone to Florida and led the charge thus showing himself as gutsy and strong-willed enough to be President? Yes.
 If the Supreme Court hadn't acted, the Florida Legislature, Republican controlled, was ready to declare Bush the winner. Talk about a stacked deck. I think the villains in this whole piece are the American people who stood idly by and by their apathy and lack of involvement proved that a person to be president has to have that ""fire in the belly,"" but when the people in this democracy lack that ""fire in the belly"" to preserve the right for every vote to be counted, we are in real danger of losing our democracy.",1216080000,12,2267,4.970976253298153
3454577,5,B001AMHNKW,"Powerful and surprisingly intense, this movie recalls the 2000 election fiasco. Everyone is perfectly cast, but no one is more right for the role than Kevin Spacey.

i enjoy history and politics so was interested in this movie.  it does a great job going over all the issues.  it certainly leans in favor of one party over the other.  one party is valiant and brave, the other cunning and cheap.  but hey, when it comes to politics, that's how it goes i guess.  after all, this is an election year.",1214524800,8,577,4.238532110091743
3454579,5,B001AMHNKW,"You can count on anything Kevin Spacey does as great, but the big surprise in this movie was Laura Dern playing Katherine Harris.  She was outstanding as the Florida Secretary of State.

The movie does a great job of showing what went on behind the scenes, including the strategies of both sides, that led to the final outcome.  (I guess I don't need to worry about disclosing the ending.)

3454580,5,B001AMHNKW,"Like the "" movie Titanic"" we all know how this one is going to end. But don't let that stop you from watching Recount.  Spacey, as always, delivers a believable and realistic performance. His presence somehow demands your attention. Laura Dern is completely transformed and becomes Kathleen Harris, the Florida Secretary of State.  Her performance is by far the best.

There are details and personality involvements that even the most politically active person was probably not aware of that the production reveals, making it worth your time and attention.  No matter how many hours you watched CNN when this historical drama unfolded, you will learn things about the Florida recount that you did not know.

If you are a history buff, you will want to add this to your collection.  It is right up there with ""Missiles of October.""",1214179200,24,830,4.9352517985611515
3454581,4,B001AMHNKW,"What exactly went on behind the scenes of the 2000 election voting disaster, the one that decided the fates of Al Gore and George W. Bush? The HBO film ""Recount"" gives what I believe to be a fair representation of an historical event, which is ironic since the recount process put the very concept of fairness under intense scrutiny. We obviously all have an opinion on who rightfully won the presidency eight years ago, but I'm not here to debate who was right and who was wrong; I wasn't even old enough to vote back in the year 2000. I'm only here to review a movie. Yes, it tackles a political subject, but that doesn't mean it takes a definite political stance--generally speaking, each side has equal say, and not surprisingly, each side makes valid and not-so-valid points. Writer Danny Strong deserves a lot of praise, not only for showing both sides of the political spectrum, but also for not forcing us to agree with any side in particular.

I have no doubt the recount was more exhausting for those running the campaigns, simply because they were doing all the hard work; both candidates did nothing more than wait for the end result. Overseeing much of Gore's campaign was his former Chief of Staff, Ron Klain (Kevin Spacey), a loyal Democrat embittered after being replaced, first by Tony Coelho, then by Bill Daley (Mitch Pileggi). On election day--November 7--the Gore team gets word of a problem in Palm Beach County, Florida: a number of voters, confused by the ballot voting system, felt they had accidentally voted for Independent Pat Buchanan. This led to a number of TV networks receiving differing poll numbers by the end of the day, some confirming Gore's victory, others confirming Bush's. Hours of retractions and projections paved the way for a statewide machine recount, which meant that Gore was not yet willing to concede.

But problems arose with the machine recounts, mostly the fact that most voting centers were not willing to run the ballots through the machines a second time. They only re-tabulated the results saved on the machines' memory cards. At a certain point, machine recounts no longer seemed viable because of chads, those infamous bits of paper punched out of voting ballots. If the chad was left hanging, the machine could potentially push it back into the hole and read it as a non-vote. The same would be true of a dimpled chad (a chad not punched all the way through). Democratic strategists opted for a hand recount, believing it would more accurately reveal the voters' intentions. Klain and his team demanded the ballots be recounted in the four Florida counties likely to have voted Democratic: Broward, Miami-Dade, Volusa, and Palm Beach.

This set into motion an absolute legal nightmare. Secretary of State Katherine Harris (Laura Dern)--a staunch Bush supporter--immediately oversaw the certification process for the recount, refusing to extend the November 14 deadline despite the need for more time. With the help of former Secretary of State James Baker (Tom Wilkinson), Harris and her Republican advisors announced that hand recounts were not allowed, thus suspending the entire recount process. It wasn't long before the Democrats discovered something interesting: according to Texas law--signed by Bush when he was Governor--hand recounts are preferred over machine recounts, and a dimpled chad does count as a vote. But this begs the question: Why would an out-of-state law have any bearing on the Florida recount, even if it was signed by the potential President Elect?

And what about military ballots? Should they have counted at all? Keep in mind that they weren't given postmarks, signatures, or dates, meaning there was no way to prove they had been sent in before the deadline. Klain's attempts to keep these ballots out of the recount were thwarted as soon as Joseph Lieberman, Gore's running mate, publicly insisted that they be counted; at that point, it seemed less and less likely that Gore would win the election. Even when an African American pastor came forward as part of a voter purge list (simply for having a similar name to a convicted felon), little could be done to stop the inevitable. Never mind the fact that the list contained 20,000 illegal rejections, half of which were from the black population; the U.S. Supreme Court still decided to order a stay of Florida's undercounted ballots.

Of course, there has to be that final moment when Gore quotes a wise man: ""I have to end this war when I know I can't win."" He says this to Klain over the phone, officially backing down and letting Bush have the presidency. It's a somber moment to be sure, although I'm hard pressed to say that the entire point of ""Recount"" was for the audience to mourn Gore's loss and condemn Bush's victory. For the most part, the film's liberal and conservative perspectives are nicely balanced. In one scene, for example, Warren Christopher (John Hurt) says, ""There's no shame in placing country above party,"" and that's a little too pacifistic for Klain's taste. Indeed, Christopher took the path of least resistance during the early stages of the recount, and he left before anything was resolved. By the time a resolution is reached, Michael Whouley (Denis Leary) walks with Klain and asks, ""If W had asked for a recount, would the Supreme Court have stopped it?"" What a thought-provoking question. If only it could be answered.",1212537600,58,5402,4.938393839383939

Like-minded people (psychopaths... hey Kevin ""Frank Underwood"" Spacey) gravitate toward one another. Was it a coincidence that the 2000 election controversy happened in Florida? Just do the math.

Jeb Bush, member of the Bush crime family since birth - governor of Florida.
Katherine Harris, daughter to one of the wealthiest families in the country and a misguided religious zealot - secretary of state of Florida.

Yeah, I'm sure it was just a coincidence.

All you so-called ""Christians"" and lovers of Katherine Harris, I love to break it to you but AMERICA IS NOT A CHRISTIAN NATION. The words ""Jesus Christ, Christianity, Bible, Creator, Divine, and God"" are never mentioned in the Constitution, not even once. When the Founders wrote the Constitution, they specified that ""no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States (Article 6, section 3)."" Of the seven men who are considered the ""Founding Fathers"" of America, only John Jay can be considered an orthodox Christian. The other six (John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison and George Washington) were Deists. Take a look at the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jefferson-Bible-The-Life-and-Morals-of-Jesus-of-Nazareth/dp/1604591285/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth</a>&nbsp;if you don't believe me. It's only 100 pages because Jefferson took out all the stuff he didn't like and that amounted to a lot of words.

Deism noun
1. belief in the existence of a God on the evidence of reason and nature only, with rejection of supernatural revelation (distinguished from theism).
2. belief in a God who created the world but has since remained indifferent to it. ~ dictionary.com

Harris was a headline speaker at the Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church's ""Reclaiming America for Christ"" conference held in Ft. Lauderdale on March 1718, 2006. Their stated mission of is ""To inform, equip, motivate, and support Christians; enabling them to defend and implement the Biblical principles on which our country was founded."" Yeah, sure.

What led to Harris' husband's ""suicide"" in 2013? Why would a billionaire commit suicide? Was he bored? Was he getting too risky for his wife and her handlers? Reminds me of another husband married to a Katherine who supposedly committed suicide; Phil Graham, husband of Katherine Graham, owners of the Washington post, supposedly committed suicide in 1963 after he made statements in public about JFK's affair with Mary Pinchot Meyer. Mary was murdered a year later.

What's all that got to do with the movie you ask? Like every ""official"" investigation into severe and underhanded injustices in this country, and every type of semi-fictional ""reenactment"" and/or movies with disclaimers at the end, this movie falls far short of the whole truth. It leaves out critical details as to the SECRET MOTIVES of people in positions of power and so paints an incomplete picture. Even JFK (the movie), as long as it is, could not possibly tell the whole story. But as a truthful account of history, Recount leans toward the fallacious proclivities of politicians (like Harris, who wasn't too happy with this movie), supreme court justices (and critters of their ilk), and that is the reason I give it four stars. It's difficult to get all the details into a 1.5 hour movie even if the producers desired to. And they probably did not or could not.

For every cause there is an effect and the effects of this so-called ""election"" are still being felt. Would 9/11 have happened if Bush lost? Would two million Iraqis have been killed if he lost? I don't think so. Would our daily freedoms and lives be threatened today under the ambiguous and unconstitutional wording of ""The Patriot Act"" and ""The National Defense Authorization Act"" today if it weren't for the George W Bush presidency? The shadow government needed a compliant puppet in place to carry out their plans for the subsequent wars and gradual eradication of the Constitution and they stop at nothing to achieve their goals.

""In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way."" ~ Franklin D. Roosevelt

""Subsequent analyses cast further doubt on conclusions that Bush likely would have won anyway, had the U.S. Supreme Court not intervened. An analysis of the NORC data by University of Pennsylvania researcher Steven F. Freeman and journalist Joel Bleifuss concluded that a recount of all uncounted votes using any standard (inclusive, strict, statewide or county by county), Gore would have been the victor."" ~ wikipedia.org",1458259200,2,5538,5.75916870415648

3454632,5,B001AMHNKW,"Fascinating dramatization about the Bush-Gore election of 2000 and how the key players jostled for advantage as events unfolded.  Even though we know how things turned out, the story is still compelling to watch, with its quirky characters, and fast moving plot twists.

The narrative is slightly biased toward the Gore camp, but is even-handed enough that the viewer also gets to see how the Bush side interpreted the situation.  The final arguments to the Supreme Court are faithfully reproduced and help explain the issues that ultimately decided the case, especially the violation of the Equal Protection Clause resulting from having different standards for counting votes in different counties.

I remember thinking at the time, like many people, that the Supreme Court had simply stolen the election for Bush.  But after watching this film, I came away with a deeper understanding of the legal reasoning that led to the Supreme Court's decision.

In retelling the story, the film raises many provocative questions about our system and the process of counting votes.  The central question remains: in a close election where the instructions and voting mechanisms are clearly imperfect, is it any more fair to use a subjective and inconsistent system of trying to ascertain the intent of the voter?  The Court said no, but your opinion will probably be based on who you supported in the election.",1456617600,6,1400,5.136563876651983

The movie is NOT a documentary. The movie does have a point of view that Al Gore should have won the presidential election. While there is no question the election was very,very close and the election results in Florida could have gone either way, in reality I doubt if the Democratic party
conduct in the campaign was as clean and navie as the movie seems to believe.

The benefit of the movie is it shows that with a county divided (and even today more so) that it is important that in every state the goal should
always be that the true results of people's wishes should be known. Candidates of both parties are spending millions on the election and the States should be spending at least some on the election machines to ensure the views of all the voters are given equal weight.",1444176000,,1015,4.540983606557377

Every legal American voter has a right to have their vote counted, and any American should believe in and stand up for that. I believe HBO (that always leads in bringing these historical situations to air) did a great job on casting and on the story-telling aspect with this film to keep things moving forward at a good pace. This isn't really something that could have ever been 'boring' but it could have still been slow and draggy.

3454713,1,B001AMHNKW,"This Drama, ""based on real events"" is but another prime example of the huge disparity between liberals version of the truth & conservatives version. This is a disparity I have analyzed repeatedly for over three decades. Sadly for liberals are that there is also a huge disparity between the genuine accuracy of conservative truths & liberals truths when it comes to indisputable facts.

Bottom line. Bush won. The facts support that fact clearly & indisputably. Liberals cheated, lied & invented baseless accusations that are now documented in film. For them this is another rinse, lather, and repeat from the liberal playbook. Sigh!

I believe that due to their shameful inability to acknowledge this indisputable reality [as well as their well-documented ability to invent, reinvent & redefine ad nauseam, their version of ""the facts""], we will continue to see Hollywood churn out ""Crockumentaries"" that conveniently invent, reinvent, etc. ""the facts"" to a version of reality that fits their leftist world view in spite of inconvenient truths known as indisputable facts that utterly destroy their version of the truth.  Once again this is simply another case of liberal projection.

Unfortunately, the old adage, 'the truth hurts' does not apply here. By & large, liberals have annoyingly become unable to accept any indisputable facts contrary to their world view. Obviously, this makes practically all disagreement on any issue impossible to be openly & accurately debated such that the public can legitimately asses differing viewpoints & form their own reality based point of view of the political debates of the issues. The same can be said about practically every media outlet {AKA the Liberal Media}.

FWIW, I totally expect leftists to vehemently disagree & project their character failures on me, ET AL [you know the drill  personal attacks, churlish, even vulgar, yet baseless insults ad nauseam. Been there, done that, got the tee shirt.

3454715,5,B001AMHNKW,"The United States Presidential Election of the New Millennium 2000 A.D., was a historic election if ever, there was one. Even more so, than the Nixon/Kennedy Presidential Election of 1960. This election by far, was unprecedented and definitely one for the books. They knew it was going to be close. But even newscaster's and those who project Presidential Elections never dreamed, it would be razor thin and so intensely scrutinized or dramatic. With Democrats and Republicans out in full force, who was going to win? In the final hours, the projected winner was George W. Bush, Jr. the Republican Candidate, who had won the Presidential Election of the year 2000 A.D., or did he? Because just before the defeated Democratic contender was about to make his anticipated and customary concession phone call and subsequent speech, he was stopped by one of his aids and was told..., that the State of Florida voting polls, showed a discrepancy. The news media was on it. Phone lines were jammed. The newspapers sold out. And the news reporters were scratching their heads wondering ""...what is going on?"" Suddenly, the voting booth had a new term: Hanging Chad's. What's that? Well, depending on who you asked in the media, everyone had their own interpretation. Counts and recounts? Then, a count of the recount to make sure, that the original count and recount, was correct. Got that? Sure you do! From the specific cities, to the certain counties, to the Florida State Supreme Court and on too, the Supreme Court of the United States. Who would have ever thought, eh?! The dimple in the paper on the voting ballot which was measured by millimeters and intent, was now known, as the ""Hanging Chad."" A new political era had arrived. And, if they weren't on their soap boxes before, then the mighty men and women of the new hanging chad 'count and countess' era, were waving their chad banners... high, while valiantly standing on their not so politically correct, milk crates. In conjunction with their judicial counterparts, who were happily busy, legislating from the bench. The divide was definitely, on. Oh, yeah! One day yes, and the next day, no. The voters were screaming for their rights and claiming that they were denied, the right to vote. Yet somehow..., the hanging chad that mysteriously appeared on the voting ballot, just happened to have their name on it. But, never mind that little fact. Let's scream, anyway! Why? Because it is our 'right!' This is, after all, America. We've built up momentum and have the complimentary media coverage, which is what election committee budgets are for anyway's, so let's go for it. Let's elect a President by 'intent'. What a novel, idea. And if that doesn't work, then the following Presidential Election instead of hanging chads we'll go with, hmm...let's see, oh I know, it'll be the ""Year of the Scratches."" On and on, it went for over a month until finally, the Supreme Court made it's ruling: Mr. George W.

3454730,3,B001AMHNKW,"Kevin Spacey was great, as were many of the other actors and actresses. The screenplay was well written and engrossing to watch. But for those who don't know the history or haven't done any research don't use this as a historical account. There were many factual inaccuracies, falsehoods, lies and complete reversal of truths in this film. These are my notes about the film as it went along.

Palm Beach County  had been using the same butterfly ballot for over 30 years. It was set up and designed by Democrats and the election commission in Palm Beach County was controlled 100% by Democrats. The film does portray that Palm Beach county Democrats were the first to lawyer up which is a good thing. The bad thing is even though Democratic operatives went door to door in Palm Beach County they could find less than 100 people who actually were confused by the ballot, this is NEVER mentioned in the film and in fact it portrays many people coming forward which history tells us were actually paid democratic operatives bussed in.

Calling Al Gore as winner in Florida  The film shows that it was called early and incorrectly but never mentions that there were at least 12-14,000 disenfranchised voters that never voted in the western counties (this according to Democratic polling). According to the same Democratic polling at least 60% of those would have gone to Bush thereby increasing his margin of victory even greater. The film also never tells that the media analysts that incorrectly called the state for Al Gore, even though Bush was leading in the exit polls by a very small margin, had familial ties to Gore and also a PAID consultant for the Democratic Party. Remember the correction to the obvious wrong call didn't come out till the polls had closed in Western Florida, this was probably one of the most underhanded dirty tricks ever played in national politics but didn't even get a mention in the film.

Gores Concession and taking it back  The film did a good job explaining why Gore retracted his concession to Bush back. At that stage of the game it really was a very close race and he had every right to want a fair recount of all the ballots. However the Bush comments that the film portrayed were wholly inaccurate according to both Bush and Gore.

Kathleen Harris  Her portrayal was ludicrous, if she would have been a Democrat and portrayed this way by the Republicans this movie would have been labeled ANTI-Women and showing woman as stupid, dumb and vain. The fact is Katherine Harris graduated Harvard University with a Masters degree, she was an executive for IBM and a Vice President of large commercial real estate firm before becoming a Florida State Senator. In fact the film later on gave her credit for thwarting an activist Democratic Judges decision that the best Republican operatives couldn't figure out how to do. While the film did accurately portray the harsh attack that Kathleen Harris had to endure it didn't mention that the protestors outside of her office were democratic operatives or that every Democratic media person had received memos excoriating her. For some reason liberals (supposedly pro-women) always portray conservative women as being stupid and attack them mercilessly. I wish people would see through this anti-women rhetoric that percolates throughout the left.

1st Florida Vote Count  The film portrays it correctly that Bush won
2nd Florida Vote Count  The Mandatory recount (ordered by Kathleen Harris)  The film never told the audience but Bush won again.
3rd Florida Vote Count  The film lied through its teeth and said that Florida didn't have a legal way to request a whole state recount. That is false. The fact is the Gore team (Warren Christopher and Bill Daley) did not want a whole state recount, because that would force the state to count overseas ballots that the Gore legal teamed had sealed (and were never counted). They knew a whole state recount would result in a third victory for Bush and this would be a show stopper for the American people. However others on the Gore team (Ron Klain and David Boies)  knew that the only way Gore could win was to force selected recounts of only counties that were highly Democratic, which was against Florida Election law. They also knew that with a supportive FSSC (Florida State Supreme Court) they would be able to tweak the election law and allow this.  This is why they resorted to lawsuits. They wanted to change Florida election AFTER the votes had been cast. NOTE: The film never once stated that individual county recounts were illegal, instead it portrayed them as a heroic fight put forth by the democrats rather than the subversion of election law. NOTE: At the end of the film Klain does admit that their major error was not asking for a whole state recount, this mea culpa is easily missed but is really the biggest blunder that the Democrats made. It was their only legal recourse, we know now through the media consortium recounts of the ballots that Bush still would have won but it would have shown that they were in fact wanting to have a fair election with all of the ballots counted.

Lawyering up  The film alludes to the fact that both the Democrats in Palm Beach County and Al Gores team were the ones to bring in the lawyers. However it incorrectly portrays that Bush was also lawyering up at the same time. In fact one of the blunders that many non-partisan observers pointed to was the late arrival of a Bush legal team to Florida.

Palm Beach voters demand for a recount  The film portrays this as if it really happened. Facts show that this was a staged event by the Democrats and Jesse Jackson, who was flown in on a private jet funded by the Democratic Party. There is film records of the busses that brought many of the protestors in from other counties. The film also lied about Gore wanting Jesse Jackson out when the call for him to go there was made either by Gore or his right hand man.

Republican response  The film portrays that the republicans took the offensive in getting operatives in and protestors when in fact they were on the defense and actually getting their people in place 2-3 days after the Gore team had already mobilized and gotten the media on their side.

Gore taking the high road  Again all of the evidence seems to point that Gores was a win at any cost (at least when he personally thought there was a chance). He lawyered up, he brought in tens of thousands of Democratic operatives, etc. etc. The film blatantly lied about the threat of violence, which was, according to most insider reports, their threat and they seemed to be gearing up for it. Give the man credit, their machine worked much better than Bushs and nearly got him the white house.

No law firm in Florida will represent Al Gore  That point is laughable considering that the Democratic Party paid over $7.6 million dollars in legal fees to Florida Law firms for their assistance during the election debacle.

Legal Remedies  The film did accurately portray that there was no legal remedy by a fair court.

Legal Fight- The film totally falsified the historical record (one of the biggest lies in the film). The Democrats filed over 20 lawsuits throughout Florida hoping to push the case to the highly partisan FSSC. It was the Republicans that refused to fight a legal battle and only responded to the cases. It wasn't until later that the republicans went to the USSC to counter the highly partisan rulings from the FSSC.

FSSC  The film accurately portrays that the FSSC is a far left court that is highly partisan. It also accurately portrays that the republicans realized that Gore was maneuvering cases to get to the FSSC. The film however claims the Republicans realized it very early on which is false, the internal memos show that they only realized it when the Democrats appealed a ruling the FSSC, which was on break came in to hear the case within 48 hours, something that was unprecedented.

Extending the deadline  the film claims there was no logical reason to not extend the deadline. That is false, the LAW dictated the methods allowed to resolve close decision. First there is the regular count, then a Mandatory recount if the votes are close enough and finally any candidate can request another state recount with election supervisors on hand. All of this must be done before the deadline. Kathleen Harris was required by LAW to certify the count on a specific date. Remember the Democrats could have legally asked for a 2nd recount (which they did not want), instead they went the illegal route and tried to recount only their chosen counties and then they wanted to extend the deadline (also illegal but allowed by the FSSC). As the film said Al Gore isn't interested in counting all of the votes, he is only interested in counting Al Gore votes.

Kerey Carpenter  The blatantly lied about her. They show her receiving some sort of badge and telling people that she was an official from the board of elections which is 100% false. Judge Charles Burton,  who was the person who interacted with Kerey in said that she clearly identified herself as a lawyer as was there to offer her opinions and monitor the recount (all legal) for the Bush team. The film LIED about this plain and simple. Another thing the film did was lie through omission while Kerey was there for Bush it forgot to mention that there were 4 other lawyers advocating for Gore and they had been there for almost 48 hours. The fact is the Gore team was always a step ahead and more lawyered up than the Bush team but you would never know it by watching this.

Democrats willing to go to jail by breaking the law  The film actually did a good job showing that the Democratic supporters were willing to break the law and go to jail if they got Al Gore elected. This was a win at any cost attitude that permeated the Democrats. It also showed quite convincingly that the republicans were stunned at this attitude and didn't understand how the democrats could be so flippant and willing to break laws to get their guy elected.

Palm Beach County suspending the recount  The film correctly showed that the 3 democrats on the Palm Beach county board voted 2-1 to suspend (or in favor of Bush) the recounts. Two of them felt it was better to follow the law and they had no legal authority to break it (which is good), however they were later excoriated by the voters, including getting death threats (30 for Carol Roberts in 3 days), having their homes and cars vandalized and never getting reelected while the 1 person who was willing to break the law was reelected and treated as a hero (that is bad).

Broward and Palm Beach county lawsuits  The film shows that the Democrats knew they were going to lose the lawsuit that would change Florida State Election law, but they didn't care. What the film doesnt show was that there plan was to move it to the FSSC where they had a guaranteed victory.

Absentee Ballots  The film lied about absentee ballots, it was the Republicans that wanted the absentee ballots and oversea ballots counted (they generally favor Republicans by a decent margin) if they were legal. The democrats didn't want military ballots (which generally don't have a postmark since they are sent via military carriers) to count even though the law says that as long as they were certified in mail bundles on or before the election they get to count. While some of the ballots that arrived BEFORE the election did get counted (the film shows this). The majority of ballots that were unambiguously mailed before the deadline date but arrived after the vote never got counted, a little known fact that the film never shows. The film did correctly show that Joe Liebermann thought they should be counted which as many people knew would actually seal the election in Bushs favor.

Going to the FSSC  The film lied again that there was some sort of question if the Democrats should go the FSSC. This is absolutely false as personal memoirs, internal memos and a whole host of other sources show. This WAS the goal all along, to get this case to the overly friendly FSSC, this isn't conjecture, this a known fact.

FSSC ruling  Completely changed the election law AFTER the election and allowed selective county hand recounts. Ironically it only allowed 4 counties to be recount, the 4 most Democratic counties in Florida. This was an obviously a hyper partisan ruling that was designed to get Gore into office. In fact when the USSC (United States Supreme Court) heard this ruling they remanded it to the FSSC by a 9-0 ruling with probably one of the most strongly worded rebukes in the courts history. Ironically the Republicans were sure that they would get at least 7-2 ruling on this one but they were worried about Thomas and Scalia buying their argument. Think about that for a moment. Also the film never once mentioned the first USSC case and the stunning rebuke which to me shows a major bias.

Voter Purge list  OMG talk about lies, first of all the purge list was required by law, secondly it was up to the counties voting supervisors to ensure that these lists are correct. Voting supervisors are elected officials, therefore in mostly African American Democratic counties they are usually an African American democrat. They have no reason to suppress the vote and its up to them to verify the list and purge the names. Secondly the film states that up to 20,000 people were wrongfully purged. This is utter BS, the Democratic Party millions of dollars and used thousands of people canvasing Florida to find these votes and they could only come up with about a dozen, ironically about half of them wanted to vote for Bush. Finally when they Civil Rights commission had a hearing on the so-called voting irregularities in Florida the Democrats were only able to present 5 people who could not vote (1 was later found to actually be ineligible to vote). This is such a far cry from the claim of 20,000 that the film should be ashamed of itself.

Miami  Dade Riot  The movie is getting worse and worse. First off the Democratic voting commission took all of the ballots into a locked room, the booted out the Republican representative and excluded the press which was illegal. It was the republican representative that called this in and the republican lawyers (aka Brooks Brothers riot) went into the building along with the police who knew that there had to be oversight. Ballot tampering by Democrats had already occurred in two other counties in plain sight. The Democrats were without any options and they knew that Miami-Dade was it. They had to win and win big so when they went into a locked room with the ballots away from the press and everyone else things did get out of hand but the way the movie portrayed the actual events was a farce.

2nd Trip to the FSSC  The Gore campaign contested the election and lost so they ran to their ally the FSSC. Nobody thought they could win after the stunning rebuke the USSC had given them instead the FSSC in a 4-3 decision (three of them learned something from the rebuke) ignored Florida State Law, the US constitution and federal election law and ordered a statewide recount of undervotes, something that all court rulings (county, state and federal) have said cannot be done. What many legal scholars see was the 4 highly partisan judges on the FSSC giving the finger to the USSC and in fact ensuring a victory for Gore.

2nd trip to the USSC  The film forgot to portray the dismay that the Democrats had with the FSSC ruling. It went way too far by ordering a whole state recount which could not have been done in time for Floridas Electoral College to have counted. This would have caused Floridas senators to vote and since they favored Bush, Bush would have gotten the votes (this was the nuclear option that was talked about by Republicans but Bush refused to do it) They also knew that without giving a set standard to count the votes by (something the USSC rebuked them for in the first place) they were really snubbing their noses at those justices. The basic issue in front of the USSC was can election laws be changed AFTER an election? Al Gore and the FSSC said they needed this to ensure a fair election while the Bush campaign said you have to abide by the laws. In this case 7 of the justices agreed that you have to abide by the laws and not change them after the fact to ensure your victory.

USSC Ruling  Seven Justices of the Court agree that there are constitutional problems with the recount ordered by the Florida Supreme Court that demand a remedy. The film got it right and no matter what you have heard the official ruling is 7-2 NOT 5-4 as the late night comedians and partisan political pundits like to claim.

Al Gores defeat  The film showed that although the Democratic operatives were willing to fight this and cause much upheaval in the country it was finally Al Gore that seemed to be the more sensible one. He knew he had lost, he knew his legal challenges were specious, in the end he took the high road.

Recount presents the content in a fascinating, dramatic, yet informative way.

The film cover the campaign from a variety of angles and at many critical points.

If you want to know what really happened, read the New York Times article: ""Study of Disputed Florida Ballots Finds Justices Did Not Cast the Deciding Vote"" by FORD FESSENDEN and JOHN M. BRODER, Published: November 12, 2001

""A comprehensive review of the uncounted Florida ballots from last year's presidential election reveals that George W. Bush would have won even if the United States Supreme Court had allowed the statewide manual recount of the votes that the Florida Supreme Court had ordered to go forward.

Contrary to what many partisans of former Vice President Al Gore have charged, the United States Supreme Court did not award an election to Mr. Bush that otherwise would have been won by Mr. Gore. A close examination of the ballots found that Mr. Bush would have retained a slender margin over Mr. Gore if the Florida court's order to recount more than 43,000 ballots had not been reversed by the United States Supreme Court.""

... The article goes on to explain ...
""The media consortium included The Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Tribune Company, The Washington Post , The Associated Press, The St. Petersburg Times, The Palm Beach Post and CNN. The group hired the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago in January to examine the ballots.""
...
""The consortium asked all 67 counties what standard they would have used and what ballots they would have manually recounted. Combining that information with the detailed ballot examination found that Mr. Bush would have won the election, by 493 votes if two of the three coders agreed on what was on the ballot; by 389 counting only those ballots on which all three agreed.""

3454766,5,B001AMHNKW,"The 2000 Presidential election was a nightmare, especially for us South Floridians. Palm Beach County was held up to the rest of the nation as some sort of black hole of ineptitude, local TV and AM radio stations saturated the airwaves with the tiniest detail of recount news while sun-starved talking heads flocked here en masse during the first month of tourist season, as if their very presence would expedite vote counts or assure the totals' validity.

Mistakes were made not just in So. Fla. but statewide, and more importantly by those political operatives of both parties who tried as best they could to influence counting procedures, ballot invalidations, and the general ""spin"" of seemingly minute-by-minute developments.

A motion picture about this historic election could potentially be a total bore or a chance for still disgruntled Dems to exact a bit of payback. RECOUNT is neither of these. With one exception, those 36 days of uncertainty and turmoil are presented in a fashion as fair to both sides as possible. Partisans of either candidate will not feel sleighted or that their position has been skewed or distorted.

The handling of Florida State Attorney General Katherine Harris, as ably portrayed by Laura Dern, is another matter entirely. Ms. Harris is this story's scapegoat; depicted as a twinky, an airhead and a delusional fool who believes she is Biblical Queen Esther come to save the day. It's a distasteful characterization that borders on misogynistic.

That issue aside, RECOUNT plays out like a thriller, thanks to a top notch cast and script, and a true story that's better than fiction. If you're a political animal of any persuasion and/or are interested in recent American history, you'll surely find this to be a fascinating biopic.

A good look at the characters who made the decisions and plans and what came to pass because of them.  A rather satirical and humorous look into the Florida Secretary of State, Ms. Harris, was amusing (almost Saturday Night Live).",1290470400,,383,4.457142857142857
3454768,4,B001AMHNKW,"Recount is a stunning docudrama -- a fictionalized event of the most unprecedented election in the United States between George Bush and Al Gore in the year 2000. The movie sticks pretty close to the facts, although it diverges in certain parts for dramatic impact.

While I was watching it, I thought that it was pretty partisan in favor of the Democrats; however, later on when I watched selected features, which included interviews with both Democratic and Republican key players, I realized that Recount tried to be fair.

Any which way you look at it, the election results in Florida were a disaster that year. Many seniors became confused by the ballots and thought that they were voting for Gore when instead they voted for Buchanan. Up to 20,000 people were wrongly considered to be felons and prevented from voting, many of whom were African-American. African-Americans were also adversely affected because some of the polling machines that malfunctioned were in poorer neighborhoods that blacks were more likely to inhabit.

Democrats asked for a recount but instead of asking to count the entire state of Florida, or better yet, to have Florida return to the polls to vote again, they hand-picked certain counties that were more likely to have voted for Gore. And Democrats had issues with some of the military ballots, rightly so, because they lacked postmarks, which made it hard to determine if they had been received by the deadline. Since many military men and women are more likely to vote Republican, arguing to disregard those votes would have been tantamount to subtracting votes for Bush.

The official conclusion of this movie is that we'll never really know who won the election of 2000, but it seemed to me that the unofficial conclusion was that Al Gore won and that the Supreme Court was way out of line by giving the election to Bush (easy to do when the Secretary of State was a Republican friend and fan of the Texas governor's, and Bush's brother was the governor of Florida). Much more disconcerting is the notion that we can't really trust our polling devices. What the hell is this about hanging chad? I'm an American living in Canada for the last 20 years and we have ballots that are very direct. I just mark an X right next to the person I want to vote for. Only one person on each line. No way to get confused and very simple to recount by hand if there's a need.

Another unsettling feature of this movie, that continues to pop up in recent elections, is that the population is pretty well divided down the middle in terms of the two-party system. It's shocking in a country of 330 million people that *anyone* can win by 1784 votes or 324 votes or 154 votes or however which way you want to count the fiasco in Florida. A clear presidential victory would have someone winning by tens of thousands of votes, at least. Our presidents don't really have a mandate to rule. They are squeaking in, almost as minority governments. That even split is as scary as the ballot process in the US.",1281312000,2,3023,4.69622641509434
3454769,5,B001AMHNKW,"GOP members of Amazon wave an imperial hand and call this film ""fair,"" on balance. That is missing the point. This was a catclysmic national tragedy the result of which many people are dead today -- leaders do matter. If 20,000 African-Americans were not thrown off the rolls, if punch card machines were not counted, bizzarely enough, by automated machines which tended to push the chads back in, if thousands of people were not confused by a ballot into voting for a candidate they despised (Pat Buchanan, who took their side), the world would be a very different one today. As usual, the tragedy was enabled by the dithering of stupid Democrats, who scared away at the first band of staged protesters, or first critical article in The New York Times.

I will say that the mimicry of the Florida atmosphere, the media circus, the direct excerpts from the opinions of the court, and the dead on impressions of Christopher, Boies, Harris (from scene one a nincompoop) and Baker are eerie. Even if a few scenes have been thrown in for dramatic effect, no one is a monster and all are scrambling for self-interested political gain. It happens that right was on the Democratic side. They had no clue how to use it. (Change, much?)

Taking the longer view, the very narrow establishmentarian means and methods flashed by both parties (corporate media, politicized courts, hired protesters, some vague abstraction called the hoi polloi out there, for which this is all being done for), go a long way toward explaining the mess we are in. Find a decent 3rd party, because the parties who brought us this, the Iraq/Afganistan wars, the bailout and the meager ""recovery"" will not do...much longer.",1257206400,4,1689,4.840830449826989

3454771,4,B001AMHNKW,"The basics of this election are this:  There were ""three"" votes by the U.S. Supreme Court in this matter that totaled in sum 21-6 in favor of Mr. Bush as follows: First, the Court voted 9-0 to ""reverse"" the Florida S.C.'s November 21 ruling to
extend the deadline to submit votes from November 14 to November 26 - thus the whole vote counting fiasco was moot; Second, the Court voted 7-2 to reverse on an ""equal protection"" basis the Florida S.C.'s December 8th ruling ordering a statewide hand recount of undervotes; Third, the 5-4 ruling was the outcome of the first two rulings.  The Florida Supreme Court had changed the ""election rules"" after the election.  It is the Florida legislature that determines the election
rules not the Court after the election was already held.  All post election media
studies determined that Bush would have won anyway.  In fact, the Palm Beach Post
reported that in Miami-Dade County, Bush would have picked up 6 votes over Gore and this is one of four heavily Democrat counties Gore chose to have a recount in saying ""that result would have been a hard blow to Al Gore's hopes of claiming the presidency in a recount.""",1254096000,,1156,4.702970297029703

As Dickens would say, it was the best of times. . .it was the worst of times, and the HBO film RECOUNT brings it all back--from the tension and drama to actual CNN, FOX, and network news clips.  The story is told mostly from the Democratic point of view, but why not?  Their side ultimately lost (which subsequently meant the entire country lost), so isn't this perspective inherently more interesting?  We get to meet Gore campaign operatives Ron Klain (Kevin Spacey is superb) and Michael Whouley (Denis Leary, whose expletive-laced description of Florida voting machines had me rolling on the floor), who experience endless frustration and setback after setback in their attempts to get all the votes counted.  The Gore legal team is led by former Secretary of State Warren Christopher (John Hurt), who (according to the film) gives up his strategy of diplomacy and appeasement and makes way for the more aggressive Klain.  I also got re-acquainted with Gore legal beagle David Boies (Ed Begley Jr.), who argued so eloquently before the U.S. Supreme Court.

On the Bush side, Tom Wilkinson is fantastic as feisty ex-Secretary of State Jim Baker; while Bob Balaban gives a most admirable performance as Bush campaign strategist Ben Ginsberg.  But Laura Dern steals the entire show as Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris; from her Frankenstein makeup to her obvious cluelessness, this was one lady in way over her head.

RECOUNT brings back all the machinations and manipulations of the legal struggle for the Presidency of the United States, but it also gives us a very human component.  For instance, at the end of the film, Baker gives Ginsberg a very moving anecdote about his switching political parties many years back.  The human aspect adds to the drama and the intrigue, which makes reliving the 2000 election in RECOUNT a most rewarding experience.

3454776,5,B001AMHNKW,"Recount is a sad but truthful reminder that the freedom to vote in America is part illusion. It is also a strong statement that the U.S. Supreme Court can be manipulated to ""spin"" decisions based on the representative power that is in the current majority. As of 2009, five of the nine justices are Roman Catholics, their decisions being influenced deeply by the Pope. That said, Recount offers a factual analysis -- told in drama form -- of the 2000 Presidential election that went to the loser, courtesy of the U.S. Supreme Court. In hindsight, one can only wonder if 911 would still have occurred under a President Gore (i.e., in the early days of his presidency, President Bush & his Chief of Staff ordered the Director of the CIA to stop briefing them about Osama Bin Laden, saying that they didn't share his concern).",1235001600,2,823,4.682758620689655
3454777,3,B001AMHNKW,"Surprisingly entertaining but ultimately not very topical anymore (the two sides have stayed pretty much unchanged since the 2000 Presidential election debacle in Florida), RECOUNT is engaging thanks to the powerful performances of some high-caliber actors.

Kevin Spacey (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Superman-Returns/dp/B000J10EQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Superman Returns</a>) leads the way as attorney Ron Klain. Pulled into the legal quagmire of Al Gore's attempt to get a recount done in Florida after several irregularities popped up, Spacey is easy to watch and makes the viewer feel at home with the character/man.

By his side is the foul-mouthed but implacable Michael Whooley (Dennis Leary,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ice-Age-2/dp/B000ICLRJI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ice Age 2</a>) who fights tooth-and-nail to try and get the recount started, too, but is hamstrung by idiots within the Democratic Party and a surprise ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court (did you know that they basically elected George Bush?). Tom Wilkinson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Exorcism-of-Emily-Rose/dp/B0019CB5T8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Exorcism of Emily Rose</a>) hits the other side of the tables (i.e., the Republicans) as James Baker. Crafty and wise, Baker gets ahead of the game and wins for his side thanks to some unique legal maneuvers.

I would be remiss, however, if I didn't give some serious kudos to Laura Dern who played the role of Katherine Harris, the former Secretary of State of Florida. Winning a surprising Golden Globe award for Best Supporting Actress in a made-for-TV film, Dern's Harris was absolutely flawless. Her self-absorbed persona mixed with her powerful position made me shiver, which was exactly what I should've been doing.

The sad part is that with a few more dollars I think this film could've been upgraded from `made-for-TV' and had a decent showing at cinemas. But we have what we have. It's an interesting run at a nine-year-old subject, and it still eats at me, but it didn't deliver anything I didn't already know ...and loathe.",1233446400,3,2207,6.1558441558441555
3454778,5,B001AMHNKW,"I'm sure that a lot of Republicans who saw Recount complained that the film is biased towards the Democratic side of the story. To be sure, the Democrats (led by Kevin Spacey as Ron Klain, Denis Leary as Michael Whouley and Ed Begley as David Boies) are clearly meant to be way more sympathetic than the Republicans (led by Tom Wilkinson as James Baker, Bob Balaban as Ben Ginsberg and, hilariously, Laura Dern as Katherine Harris). I have to admit that were I a Republican, it would be very easy to label Recount as yet another biased Hollywood product. However, the bias that appears so blatant on the surface is not as glaring when one digs deeper.

First of all, at least some of the dirty tricks detailed in Recount did indeed happen. The Florida GOP did suppress the vote by striking voters from the lists in minority districts who happened to have the same names as convicted felons. The GOP did encourage their supporters to harrass and intimidate election officials who were reviewing the ballots. The incident where hundreds of angry Bush supporters banged on the door of the office where the ballots were being counted was recorded on tape (in fact, a clip of the real incident is shown over the closing credits). And while it probably won't count as a dirty trick, the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush vs. Gore did indeed contain a clause that said that decision would not be binding in future cases. All of these incidents are documented.

Obviously, Katherine Harris could not have been happy with her portrayal in Recount. (Most of the cast met with their real life counterparts with the exception of Dern with Harris) However, Harris never threatened legal action against the filmmakers, indicating that either she didn't feel taking legal action was worth the trouble or that what the film said about her, while extremely unflattering, was basically true. Harris is portrayed as stupid, shallow, vain and clueless so it's hard to believe that she, as a person with political ambitions, would let such a damaging portrayal slide if it wasn't based in truth.

In addition, James Baker and Ben Ginsberg have both given Recount largely good reviews (Baker even hosted a screening of the film). Baker did point out several inaccuracies in Recount, but did state that he thought that the filmmakers ""went out of their way to reach out to both sides.""

To be sure, many of the Democrats are not portrayed in a sympathetic light. Bill Daley (Mitch Pileggi) gives up and basically disappears halfway through the recount battle. Warren Christopher (John Hurt) is portrayed as effete, ineffective negotiator who is more concerned about decorum than actually winning the election for Gore. In fact, aside from Katherine Harris, the real life counterpart who had the most problems with his portrayal was Christopher. Even Baker defended Christopher, claming that the former Secretary of State wasn't nearly as ""wimpish"" as he was portrayed in Recount.

Hollywood always takes some license, no matter what the subject matter. The climactic meeting between Spacey's Klain and Wilkinson's Baker, for example, never happened (Baker claimed it was added to add a bipartisan touch to the film). However, Recount is hardly as radically biased as some might claim. For example, when James Baker tells Ben Ginsberg of his wife's death and George H.W. Bush's kind offer to run his Congressional campaign as a way to get his mind off his loss, I don't think anyone -- Democrat or Republican -- will not be moved by the story. Recount, despite any claims to the contrary, is much more shades of gray than simple black and white.",1231977600,2,3618,4.895595432300163
3454779,4,B001AMHNKW,"I sort of expected this movie to have a lot of built-in commentary favoring the Democratic side, and while it has been pointed out that the movie does tend to focus a bit more on the Democratic characters and thus sort of favors them, I found the movie to be fairly well-balanced. There are certainly many accusations that came out of the Florida scene in the 2000 election, and while many of them were dealt with in the movie, overall, the movie doesn't devolve into a conspiracy theory. The biggest impression you will get from the movie is how many ups and downs there were for both sides. I also think the movie does a good job at showing both the fact that it could have gone either way, and the fact that Bush never really trailed and it was never really certain that even if the recounts had taken place, Gore would have won.",1230249600,2,832,4.374193548387097
3454780,5,B001AMHNKW,"It was a decisive moment in American History but most voters had no idea what was really going on behind the scenes. Recount is a fascinating retelling of the 2000 Presidential election as it twisted and turned through the country's fastest changing state - Florida. The movie depicts what appears to be the last grip of Jim Crow politics as it played out through dimpled chads, incomplete election laws and in the face of a radical conservative uprising. While many fine actors give excellent performances the movie itself appears to stay away from the darker dramas that sprung forth from this unfortunate outcome. I can remember what it was like because I was there.

The remaining story took place after the recount was over. Black box voting machines were forced on the various counties, millions of dollars in backroom deals spread the wealth to mostly republican operatives who prepared for Jeb Bush's re-election in 2002 and George W's re-election in 2004. Both elections far surpassed 2000 in their level of deceit and manipulation.

If you want a good grasp about what happened in Florida you need the whole story. Recount is a good place to start but then pick up my novel Purple State which turned out to be an accidental sequel picking up where the movie left off. Together they tell a tale of how our once lofty ideals of democracy can so easily be distorted by the shadowy ambitions of a few determined individuals.",1230076800,4,1430,4.808943089430894
3454781,5,B001AMHNKW,"This movie is incredibly painful to watch.  Anyone who lived through the 2000 election will remember what happened in broad strokes -- corruption, possible fraud, extreme partisanship and cronyism, and disenfranchisement on a scale that creates fond nostalgia for Jim Crow.  However those broad strokes are here shown in rage-inducing, fully restored technicolor detail as every single step of a process that resulted in what some people still see as a stolen election is put on display.

Old wounds die hard, and even after 8 years and ""A New Hope"" on the horizon, it's impossible for any politically conscious person to watch this movie silently.  Frustration boils over again and again at tactics from both sides of the aisle, and you may eventually have to put on a hat to prevent yourself from tearing every strand of your hair out.  Even though we all know how this story ended, the movie is so well-written that it all feels fresh and current even now.  Dramatically, that's a great thing.  In all other respects though, it just makes your blood boil.  In fact, I nearly gave the movie four stars until it occurred to me that what I had a problem with was the real events, not the movie.  And in fact, only a great movie could make you think this critically about the real events on which it's based.

Danny Strong shockingly pulled off his first script to perfection, which is a coup for any young writer but particularly surprising for someone who is an actor perhaps best known as the geek from ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  He brings to light the myriad ways in which a single decision, action or chance event could have changed history completely.  There are so many occasions in this film when I felt like I was watching a horror movie, screaming for the hero to turn around, run away or stay out of the basement.  The cast is what makes these 8-year-old bad choices seem so relevant again.  Kevin Spacey, Dennis Leary and Tom Wilkinson are excellent.  (So are Laura Dern and Bob Balaban, but I hated the characters/real people so much that it's difficult for me to get past that and give the actors the praise they're due.)  Ed Begley Jr. is also quite good, though it's weird to see him in a straight dramatic role.  After seeing him play so many hilarious parts in Christopher Guest's ensemble mockumentaries, I kept expecting him to turn to the camera and make a dry, hilariously off-hand remark.

The extras include two interviews with actual participants from each side of the fight conducted by the actors who played them, a short featurette on the movie and the location filming in Florida and a commentary with the writer and director.  I haven't had a chance to listen to the commentary yet, but I'm hoping that since Danny Strong spent so much time interviewing the real participants, he'll have a lot more anecdotes and stories that simply couldn't be fit into the script.  As for the interviews, I only wish they were longer.

Any student of political science will want to see this movie, and every American voter probably SHOULD see this movie.  Some might say that there's nothing to be gained by dwelling on the past, but looking back at this all-too-recent period in modern history should be a wake-up call about the flaws in our system, both legal and political.  Only when enough Americans truly wake up to this will we be able to make any real changes.  Until that time, people like the ones depicted here --ALL OF WHOM ARE REAL, LIVING BREATHING PEOPLE AND **NOT** FICTIONAL CREATIONS -- will continue to manipulate the system to their own will, which will be that of whatever political party they happen to be aligned with and have nothing whatsoever to do with justice, fairness or morality.

The truth is, that fact alone should classify this as a horror movie.  It's an extremely terrifying portrait of the potential future for this country.",1228608000,6,3878,4.725111441307578
3454782,5,B001AMHNKW,Very good movie.  It was interesting to see the goings-on behind the scenes.  It did a fair job of remaining neutral.,1227657600,,117,4.523809523809524
3454783,4,B001AMHNKW,"Overall it was a good transaction.  There were a couple stops in the tape towards the beginning, but after that it was fine.  I did not contact the seller, as it was a while before I got around to watching it and didn't know there was a problem when I first got it.  They should probably be tested before sending them out, but in all honesty, since the seller did not know I had a problem, I can't complain, because I didn't give them the opportunity to return it or correct the problem... Over all, once you get past the beginning, it is just fine and it came in no time.  Would buy from again.",1224806400,,595,4.147826086956521
3454784,3,B001AMHNKW,"Recount is a dramatization of what went on behind the scenes during the 2000 presidential election. The movie follows the voting process as it played out in Florida, which turned out to be the deciding state in selecting George W. Bush as president. The film stars an impressive lineup of actors, including Kevin Spacey, Dennis Leary, Laura Dern, Bob Balaban, Ed Begley Jr., and Tom Wilkinson.

Though I thought the movie was weighted heavily towards the Democrat point of view, it really did make me think alot about how elections are decided, how control/power is obtained, and what people are capable of when the stakes are really high. Shivers.

Performances were uniformly good, I thought. Laura Dern seems to almost channel Katherine Harris, and all the other members of this ensemble cast are very strong. I particularly enjoyed Tom Wilkinson, because he brought a layered version of James Baker (lawyer for the Bush/Republican interests) to the red side of the movie.

Also, Dave Grusin's haunting, vaguely unsettling piano score for the film was one of its primary triumphs. It captured the mood of the picture perfectly, and its spare strains added soooo much to the scenes in which they were used.",1223856000,6,1208,5.0
3454785,5,B001AMHNKW,"It is difficult to separate one's historic memory and political beliefs from a discussion of this excellent HBO production.
On balance I found the legal and strategic detail to be interesting and reasonably accurate as I remember it.  The personalities seem real with the exception of Katherine Harris as played by Laura Dern.  While Ms Dern's performance is enchanting, it does not reflect the depth of my personal image of Ms Harris' character. Kevin Spacey is, of course, fun to watch in any role he plays.
In ideology, a bit left leaning - but absorbing and ripped from the front pages of the 2000 election for President where the results were unknown for weeks after the election.  Great cast, well written and brought to film with skill and an attitude.
I like it - and I am adding this DVD to my personal collection.",1223424000,2,823,4.701388888888889
3454786,5,B001AMHNKW,"I got a copy of HBO's movie ""Recount"" and I hadn't worked up enough emotional internal fortitude (I knew it was gonna make me very, very vexed) until now. and sure enough, I *AM* vexed!

The recap of the recount is even more despicable now, with the benefit of panoramic vision and hindsight, than it was then. Unlike the ""victors"" of the subject election, the made for HBO movie, interwoven with actual News footage, legitimately wins its Emmy as Outstanding Made-for-TV Movie. Laura Dern deserved an Emmy, and the Golden Globe voters gave her their vote, for her spot-on performance as the preeningly vapid, vampy Katherine Harris, Florida Secretary of State, ""Good Soldier"" in the Bush Army. Repulsive Republican dirty tricks abound. and watch Joe Lieberman who was, even then as Gore's running mate(!) working to serve himself (potential 2004 run) and the Republicans.

Watch the movie (again, if you've seen it before)  - it'll fire you up!!  Remember what Santayana said:Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer",1223078400,4,1071,5.097142857142857
3454787,5,B001AMHNKW,"HBO consistently gives new meaning to original film programming.  ""Angels in America"", ""Wit"", ""Elizabeth"", and the list goes on.  On top of it, Jay Roach from the ""Austin Powers"" and ""Meet the Parents"" films attacks this based-on-true-story telefilm with gusto and panache.  A wonderful cast and screenplay makes this work perfectly.  It has the suspense, drama, and humor that rarely happens in most political films.  Kevin Spacey plays the central character, Ron Klain, who gets the most air time.  He constantly battles with the James Baker character played wonderfully by Tom Wilkinson.  Both Denis Leary and Laura Dern adds humor as Michael Whouley and Katherine Harris respectively.

People may think after watching that it paints the Bush recount team in an unfavorable light.  The Gore team looks almost desperate to grab more time and votes.  However you may feel in this whole chaotic scene of events, it shows how our system was certainly challenged.  First, it was at the county level, state level, and finally federal level.  Fingers are pointed at each other.  Battles lost and won.  Who really won is still up to debate.  This film gives not only entertainment value but serious reflection on our voting process.  Interpretation is a dangerous area which can lead to serious consequences.

This DVD has a boat load of extras which probably didn't make it on HBO.  The conversations between the actor and the real life characters are fun to watch.  There is also commentary from Jay Roach as well.  Let's hope that HBO continues to push the envelope with these smart films.",1221868800,4,1587,5.007662835249042

Probably her best performance since Smooth Talk.",1501891200,,283,5.902439024390244
8277986,5,B001AMHNKW,"Really good movie that relayed the accounts in a way that were easy to comprehend. All though I was only 11 years old at the time of this election I remember feeling really anxious about the outcome... as a kid! I think that election is the reason I have been into politics as much as I am and this movie is a great reminder why. Watching this movie has also reaffirmed why I am more of an ""Independent"" when it comes to the two parties, and although I tend to lean Conservative, I think there was absolutely more hurdles for Gore and probably was going to end differently. If you want to better understand what was going on, or even jsut want a good Political Thriller type of movie to watch, ""Recount"" is by far the best one even if you do know how it ended.",1499472000,2,760,4.212328767123288
