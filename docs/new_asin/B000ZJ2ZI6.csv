Debera ser un cero bien grande !,1524441600,,419,4.0602409638554215

8235684,1,B000ZJ2ZI6,"If it wasn't for a comment I might have ordered this item,until I read that it was the Mexican version,not the original. There is no comparison btw Mexican and Colombian ""telenovelas"".I hate Mexican versions,they always mess them up,and to add salt to the injury I have to listen to their""Spanish"",which SUX.",1340064000,2,308,5.0588235294117645
8235685,3,B000ZJ2ZI6,"I love this show to bits, i never get tired of watching it over and over again. The story might not be as good as the original from colombia however it still brings a smile to my face.
the downside however is not the telenovela itself but that the DVDs come damaged.  I got two DVD3 in one of the sets together with damaged DVD 5. Amazon was helpful and got a replacement however after watching them on my DVD player, it started to stop working. Something with a kind of gunk stuck to the laser... coming from the DVDs apparently dunno. It is sad that such a good show is recorded in such low quality DVD as well as a badly designed case that causes the dvds to scratch each other. Not amazon's fault though, but Laguna film's
If you want to get the show it is totally fine since it keeps u entertained just keep in mind your DVD player life is gonna go down.",1296691200,3,859,4.1437125748503
