7037279,3,B00UFMKSNM,"Roommate Wanted starts out humorous and light as two roommates Janie (Alexa PenVega) and Dee (Spencer Grammer) are feeling one another out .Janie being the  morally encompassed and more intellegent of the two and Dee is totally self centered and much more liberal where morals are concerned!

The deeper we get into the story the darker it becomes while still maintaining some camp value. The acting was perfect ,each girl playing their role to perfection. The movie takes place inside the apartment the entire time so it relys heavily on character development and dialogue.

If you're looking for a (Single White Female) type film ,this isn't it but if you want something that's still entertaining with a much lower budget and a cat fight to end all catfights this is for you. There is no gore but it does get pretty brutal and it's fun watching the girls go tit for tat and try and one up each other by doing things like putting dog poop in one's shampoo and having it esculate to a full blown war.

After all is said and done it's a fun little ride that gives you two completely different perspectives on how certain women think and feel about themselves and others. There's also some men are dogs dialogue and visual irony that goes with it,whether it was intended or not! The ending took me by suprize but I liked it.",1431993600,3,1322,4.588983050847458

7037282,4,B00UFMKSNM,This is how bad a room mate can really be! It discloses a relationship between two females working on getting a degree and they are at each other's throats. I wondered where this was going and the end was a great surprise!,1437523200,,222,4.309523809523809
7037283,2,B00UFMKSNM,WHAT IN THE HELL DID I JUST WATCH???? This is a serious WTF movie. Not a psychological movie but more the kind of movie you watch with friends. Giggling and talking while the main characters try to destroy each other. And the ending?? REALLY??? WTF?????,1435017600,,253,4.644444444444445
7037284,4,B00UFMKSNM,"Janie (Alexa Vega) is a brainy young lady attempting to get a scholarship at a prestigious graduate university. Her roommate Dee (Spencer Grammer) is a ""slut"" who enjoys her vices. These polar opposite women compete to sell their eggs, a completion that evolves into a knock down, drag out cat fight.

We have all seen those horror films where there is a psychotic roommate who emulates the other one. I can think of four off the top of my head. However, in this movie, both the women believe the other one wants to emulate them, and they go out of their way to ""help"" the other one by destroying their lives all from the inside of their home (low budget).

The production is not a horror/thriller film, but rather a dark comedy. If you have seen 3-4 roommate type film, you should be able to appreciate this one.

7037288,4,B00UFMKSNM,"""Perfect"" is not a word that came to mind while watching the dark comedy/thriller Roommate Wanted. However, there were some other words that popped into my head while watching it. Those words are ""quirky"", ""different"", and ""refreshing"". Roommate Wanted takes the evil roommate subgenre that was popularized by Single White Female and puts a completely unique spin on it.",1432684800,2,370,5.288135593220339

8705546,2,B00UFMKSNM,"Played as a sort of horror-comedy, Roommate Wanted didn't have enough of either to recommend.  Instead, it comes across as an absolute mess- don't they have script editors anymore? - like throwing a plate of spaghetti with meat sauce at a bare wall.  And it's a real shame because Alexa Vega and Spencer Grammer are excellent actresses, but the script is well below the level of their talents. The funny turns are few and far between and the violence is cruel and over the top and makes you cringe rather than be scared- one roommate feeds the other's small dog to a python, to give you a taste.  And its message of no one's perfect or better than anyone else is delivered with the subtlety of a suicide vest, the endless fight scene punctuated by unnecessary exposition which neither enlightens or convinces,  I give it one star for Vega and one star for Grammer- please forget that either actress was in this film.",1476403200,,916,4.601226993865031

8705549,5,B00UFMKSNM,It was a psychological thriller that started out to be innocent and playful; until one situation lead to a breakdown in character which led to a series of conflicts between Janie and Dee. I would watch it again.,1450569600,,211,4.578947368421052

8705552,2,B00UFMKSNM,So amazed at how cliche this movie was it took me three separate views to finish the movie just out of curiosity.  Pure good girl vs. bad girl bitch fest.  No redeeming qualities to this movie whatsoever unless you like to watch girls fight....unfairly.,1442016000,,253,4.7272727272727275
