If you have not had a chance to find her other CD's or didn't know that Amazon sold so many take a minute to visit Susie's Web Site at susieshort.net. You will be able to spend a day at the ocean with Susie and up to the Oregon Coast, to watching Bluebonnet's grow in Texas under beautiful Sunsets or just relax in a beautiful Rose Garden with Susie. And you can create your very own Christmas Cards every year after spending a few snow day's with Susie.

All her lessen's are just wonderful, they are like having Susie in your living room teaching you how to paint realistic ""topics"" . Susie seems to breathe  life into watercolor paper.  And after watching her work you will be able to do that too, she makes painting with Watercolor hassle free and easy.

You can also purchase the supplies you will need for each of Susie's CD's at her Website too, which takes over spending for what you think you might need to have before you begin also for sake at her Website. I have purchased many of her Brushes and I think I have all her CD's now,

As for which question's you might have for Susie just write to her and she does take the time to get back to you.
No  matter which CD you choose - you can't go wrong!",1305676800,7,1399,4.2406015037593985
