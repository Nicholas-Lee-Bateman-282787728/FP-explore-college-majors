1329157,4,B00003ETPS,"Lamarr is visually stunning and gives very good performances in both of these underrated gems.  Both movies are gripping and have believable plots and dialouge.  In addition the content is very racey for the time.
The image quality of this Triton DVD is good.  While not up to Criterion or tier 1 studio quality it is very watchable.  Most of the image is semi-crisp.  I did not notice alot of hiss, though there is some.  On ""Strange Woman"" there is one part lasting 1-2 minutes where there is a loud hum.
Overall this is a very good buy.  You get two movies with the beautiful Lamarr(she turns her head, lifts her eyes and a man would do anything).  The quality is better than average.  The plots and acting are great.",1085961600,18,720,4.476923076923077

1329203,4,B00003ETPS,"Among the ""lesser"" directors of film - those ""B"" movie and poverty row sorts - Edgar G. Ulmer stands out from most of the crowd as having the potential to be on the A-list.  Certainly, no major studio was really interested in a Ed Wood, Al Adamson or Coleman Francis.  In baseball terms, those directors were semi-pros or rookie league.  Ulmer was AAA material, a guy who could maybe make it to the Show but wouldn't stay there.

Ulmer made some landmark movies, most notably Detour (a classic of noir cinema), The Black Cat (an early and respected Lugosi/Karloff team-up) and The Man From Planet X (one of the first alien invader films).  None of these three, however, are in the Edgar G. Ulmer Archive, which instead features some of his lesser efforts.

The best in the bunch - and one of the few ""A"" level films in Ulmer's career - is The Strange Woman starring Hedy Lamarr as a manipulative woman who schemes her way out a bad family and into a marriage with a much older (and wealthier) man.  She has her sights set on the son, however, leading to deadly results.  When I watched this movie, I couldn't help but think of the similar Gene Tierney vehicle Leave Her to Heaven, which makes sense since the book sources for the two movies were from the same author.  A commentary track provides insights into both the movie and Ulmer's life.

The Strange Woman is pretty good; the other films in the set are fair-to-middling.  Bluebeard has John Carradine as an artist who is a serial killer in his spare time.  Strange Illusion is a take-off on Hamlet with a teenage boy suspicious of his mother's new suitor so soon after his father's death.  Daughter of Dr. Jekyll offers a variation on the popular story with a plot twist that most people will pick up on (this one stars John Agar, the hero of many a science fiction or horror movie).  Finally, there is Moon Over Harlem, a melodrama about a widow who marries a no-good gangster who soon is making the moves on her daughter.  This last film, made in the late 1930s shows its age, but with its all-black cast, is an example of early black cinema, which is often overlooked today (and for which many films probably don't even survive anymore).

There are a few other special features in the set, including a pilot TV episode for a Swiss Family Robinson series.  Oddly for late 1950's TV, this was shot in color and probably had a higher budget than most shows of the time; it looks good, but the story and acting are not as hot.  Overall, the set is interesting as an introduction to Ulmer, but since it is missing most of his best movies, it is not really an essential set.",1336262400,2,2628,4.473794549266247
1329204,4,B00003ETPS,"Hedy Lamarr was before my time, so I ordered this DVD to see if she was really as beautiful as everyone said.  Not only was she the most beautiful woman I have ever seen, but she was also a fine actress.  Well worth watching for classic movie lovers.  Also, a trivia note:  Natalie Schaffer, who played Mrs. Howell on Gilligan's Island, appears in Dishonored Lady.  Ms. Schaffer was also quite the babe in her day.",1291852800,,414,4.466666666666667
1329205,5,B00003ETPS,"This double feature gives us a good opportunity to watch Hedy Lamarr (who was said to be the most beautiful woman in the world) at the peak of her career. Once accepted that she has a flamboyant beauty, but limited acting skills, both films manage quite well to strengthen the advantages and to detract from the disadvantages. In my opinion, ""Dishonored Lady"" does it better. This typical psychological film noir is a permanent style extravaganza - note that one character says about the Lamarr character that she is ""as beautiful as a PICTURE"". Her character always being a little insecure as a ""two-faced woman"", Lamarrs deficiency as an actress perfectly fits the role! Long before his Disney career, director Robert Stevenson was a fine stylist of expressionist noir, i.e. in ""Jane Eyre"" - and in ""Dishonored Lady"".

""The Strange Woman"" is a somehow labored period picture about a (very, very) bad girl in Bangor, Maine, in the first half of the 19th century. Jenny (Lamarr) ist decided to climb the social ladder at any price, which makes her seduce and destroy more than one man (e.g. Louis Hayward and George Sanders). It's strongly entertaining and has some fascinating scenes, but different from ""Dishonored Lady"", the film does explain too much in the dialogue. It is always good when we can SEE what Jenny does, instead of being told. However, we have some interesting exercises in style, symbolism and lighting - but not as constantly as in ""Dishonored Lady"". The picture is directed by Edgar Ulmer, and Douglas Sirk is said to have done some additional directorial work.

I would rate ""The Strange Woman"" four stars and ""Dishonored Lady"" five stars.",1279929600,2,1662,4.932142857142857

Typical Hollywood movie for `starpower' and likely more enjoyable at the time.  Seems a little naive or almost infantile by todays standards.

1329218,2,B00003ETPS,"I was very disappointed in what should have been a great set.  Despite all the talk on this set about the Ulmer Restoration Corp. and some French restorations, there are just too many unacceptable issues.  On disc 1, Strange Illusion is a French restoration.  There is a long sequence where the audio is seriously out-of-sync with the picture.  I don't see how it could of been restored that way, so that must be a problem with the DVD production.  The overall picture quality is better on the Roan edition, but it has problems with splices and low audio.  The Strange Woman looks fine, but at one point has a fade out in the middle of dialogue where it looks to have missing footage.  There are also numerous audio breaks during the preacher's speech near the end.  I found the commentary very informative, though.  The special features on this disc are good, except the trailers are rather rough.  On disc 2, the French restoration of Bluebeard is a disaster.  They actually used an edited print.  These French restorations are quite cheap ones.  There were numerous edits during the initial puppet show.  It was obviously deliberate, because every scene which shows the puppeteers working the strings was edited out.  The Roan edition has the complete print and is recommended over this.  After all this, Daughter of Dr. Jekyll is actually a very good print in its OAR.  The special features on this disc are excellent.  On disc 3, Moon Over Harlem is a fair print with a few splices.  Goodbye, Mr. Germ is a good print with only one splice.  Swiss Family Robinson is a very good print, but unfortunately has an All Day Ent. logo throughout, thereby ruining any viewing of it.  This set is too problematic to give anymore than 2 stars.",1252454400,17,1738,4.688741721854305

I thought this hard to find film was out of print, if you do a search on Amazon by title you will find it used from $34 - new at $110.  The only way I found this set was by doing a search for director Edgar G. Ulmer, and this cover art was somewhat vague but it does in fact have the film in it's entirety, which is as good of quality if not better then the dvd for $110 (I've watched both).
Bluebeard is also highly recommended.  By the title I thought it was about a pirate but it's a Jack the Ripper type of tale starring John Carradine.

Good plots, good acting.  Even though her Samson & Delilah film is more known than either of these, I really do prefer these over Samson & Delilah.  I think they're both very good movies that are just as entertaining today as they were years ago.

1329222,5,B00003ETPS,"My review will be very short since there are at least 2 prior very thorough reviews. Hedy Lamarr was more than the ""most beautiful woman in Hollywood"". She never received the respect deserved for her acting ability. Ah, the curse of a physically gorgeous woman! And she was a brain too - inventor of what would become wireless technology. She is superb in both of these films which are probably 2 of her best performances next to ""Samson and Delilah"". The dvd quality is extremely good for the price. I'm always concerned about films in the public domain because print quality varies. Hedy is of course, stunningly beautiful and gives inspired & emotive performances. I always liked her film work and hope that someday, she will receive the overdue praise as a fine actress. She was extremely good at portraying the mysterious and aloof woman - something the great Kate Hepburn could not do. And let's face it, audiences LOVE bad girls. And Hedy in ""Samson & Delilah"" was one very very naughty girl. Vive Hedy Lamarr!",1168992000,4,1017,4.751412429378531
1329223,5,B00003ETPS,"Few words can describe this radiant, raven haired goddess.  This DVD is a fantastic buy showcasing Hedy Lamarr in two of her better dramatic peformances.

1329224,5,B00003ETPS,"What a perfect pairing of films.  After her production role of the fascinating and morally complex STRANGE WOMAN (see my separate 5 star review for that), Hedy was awarded this great murder mystery, based on a true story, DISHONORED LADY.

  I saw this on a very poor VHS transfer (not purchased through Amazon).  The script is wonderful - a bit melodramatic, the casting is great, but the post production aspects, especially the music are a real disappointment because Hedy shines in this film with HER FINEST ACTING WORK ON FILM.  In another role that is complex and real in its portrayal of a ""party girl"" trying to straighten out her life, her self, when she becomes a murder suspect.

  This is a real ""slice of time"" film in that it deals with women who were working, ""like men"" who ""thought like men"" i.e. enjoied and wanted careers; which was considered a real social problem at the time as men came back from the war and wanted their jobs back.  Women were meanwhile enjoing the freedom of having their own jobs their own independence, and this was seen as transgressive, especially if the woman, like this one, was also sexually liberated.

  The script hits all these notes appropriately, but the awful operatic music hammers away.  Fortunately, that wasn't on the set.  Hedy gives a layered, thoughtful, and - a rarity - a relaxed, humorous, and joyful performance.  She has a ""drunk scene"" that is playful and completely real, a very subtly funny portrayal of being ""pleasantly inebriated.""  All this makes me think this must be who she truly was.  She had just finished a film she had fought for, and was working on this fantastic character who liked working and was interested in science (as she was herself).  It is simply a MUST see for any Hedy Lamar film  (as is THE STRANGE WOMAN for other reasons)- for a glimpse of her entire range.

  Looking at her bios, this was a turning point where she started her disenchantement with roles she was being offered.  She is beautiful and tempestuous in the later SAMPSON AND DELILAH, but her heart is not in that the way it is in this film.  And she slowed down her acting quite a bit after these.

  See this to see Hedy Lamar the actress surrounded by a great supporting cast (including Margaret Hamilton - Dorothy's wicked witch), in a film which I feel is her finest work.",1143504000,15,2336,4.631707317073171

1329227,5,B00003ETPS,"""Acme"" is the Double Feature division of ""VCI/fi"" and I've always had good luck with VCI releases so I took a chance.

DISHONORED LADY: This is a wonderful film in which Hedy displays a range of emotions including tipsy.  She is a good actress and is totally gorgeous as a NYC ""modern woman"" with a promiscuity problem, she's a ""user"" and hangs out with other ""users"", she becomes despondent. Through the provedential intervention of a wise shrink, one wonders if she will overcome it and find true happiness as a simple doctor's wife -- or revert to life as a well-paid, hi-fashion magazine editor. She is also involved in a murder investigation and suspicions turn her way.  Watch for Margaret Hamilton.  The Story is a ""5"" Picture quality is about a ""4"" its not perfect but completely watchable and enjoyable, the night scenes are a little dark, but all others have good contrast with no noticable artifacts or blotches.  The sound is very good, its even & steady and when you turn the volume up it doesn't hiss. The VCI Double Feature disc is a real bargain just for this movie alone, BUT look you also have---

STRANGE WOMAN: This stars Hedy Lamarr as well as George Sanders, Louis Hayward, Gene Lockhart, Hillary Brooke, Rhys Williams, June Story, Moroni Olsen, Olive Blakeney, Kathleen Lockhart, Alan Napier, Dennis Hoey. The plot begins in Bangor Main in 1824 with Jennie Hagar as a child of about 8 at a swimming hole with some other childern all speaking with California accents.  Then the next scene is of Jennie played by Hedy with a foreign accent, noticably missing in the whole town is Main accents, but then this is the charm of old movies.  Hedy plays a manipulative temptress who marries a much older man out of need.  She plays a range of emotions in this drama. Its an enjoyable film for any Hedy Lamarr fan. The DVD quality on this film is quite good about the same as the previous film, it does a little better in the dark scenes. And the sound is clear and steady with no hiss when the volume is turned way up.

This disc has scene selections and an extra.

EXTRA FEATURE: ""Made In America"" a newsreel style advertisement/documentary about Hollywood and all the movies ""in the can"" and soon to be released, showing some behind the scene looks inorder to stir up interest in future releases.
