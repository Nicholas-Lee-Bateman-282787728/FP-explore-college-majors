OF INDIAN FLATS,AIRPLANE!,AIRPLANE 2 THE SEQUEL,RETURN OF THE KILLER
TOMATOES,and THE KILLER TOMATOES EAT FRANCE then QUEEN KONG is definitely
for you! You see back in the year 1976,when DINO DE LAURENTIS' big budget
remake of KING KONG was released,every production studio--big & small--
wanted to cash in on all the hype and craze! The country of ITALY gave us-
YETI,THE GIANT OF THE 20TH CENTURY!While Hong Kong gave us-THE MIGHTY
PEKING MAN!Independent American film producer,JACK H. HARRIS,and the
country of SOUTH KOREA gave us--A*P*E!But unlike the KING KONG wannabes
that I have just mentioned,QUEEN KONG certainly has one distinguishing
charcteristic about it that makes it DIFFERENT FROM ALL THOSE!It is an
outright COMEDY!A SPOOF and a SATIRE on all differnet types of trends,
things,people,events,and films that were going on in the 1970's. It pokes
fun at everything from JANE FONDA to JIMMY CARTER,the women's liberation
movement,hippies,disaster movies,THE EXORCIST,JAWS,PLANET OF THE APES,
and even soon to be president,RONALD RAEGAN and his acting ability! So,
if you're looking for a dead serious giant monster flick,you won't find
it here! But if you want something that keeps you dying from laughter,then
QUEEN KONG is THE ONE FOR YOU!!!!!!!",1244332800,,1334,5.512195121951219
1845774,1,B00008G965,"Ha ha.  OK, years ago I discovered a lovely Queen Kong poster on eBay, and just had to buy it.  (I collect gorillas, including King Kong, and just love having the Queen Kong poster hanging on the wall next to it.)  But the movie?!  It was absolutely painful to watch.  Unless you take some really powerful drugs beforehand...you know, the kind that make even the back of your own hand seem fascinating...don't bother watching.

If you know someone you really hate, you could strap them down to a chair, tape open their eyes (a la Clockwork Orange) and force them to watch it over and over and over....",1219104000,,601,4.518518518518518
1845775,5,B00008G965,"If you loved Airplane, Kentucky Fried Movie, Top Secret, and other genre parodies of cinema, then you MUST buy Queen Kong.  The movie is bad, but bad in such a way that it is actually good, and seems to be bad for comedic effect.  I have a feeling that if it wasn't for this movie, perhaps movies like those mentioned already wouldn't exist.

If you have a twisted sense of humor and enjoy a good campy movie that parodies other movies, then this one is for you.  If you think it might just be a good B-Movie, then you might want to check something else out.  But don't let the one star reviews discourage you from buying this!",1100736000,6,627,4.279661016949152
1845776,2,B00008G965,"As a fan of grade B movies, I thought I was adequately prepared for anything in a giant gorilla movie, as I have seen 'A*P*E' at least three times now with no side effects. I was so very wrong. This movie, obviously a parody of 'King Kong' (and in fact kept out of general release by Dino de Laurentis and his lawyers since it was made in 1976), is so totally rank in every way that I considered giving it one star, but it does have occasional moments of high camp value that help it up a bit.
This is essentially the 'King Kong' story retold from a liberated feminist's point of view. In this film, the work of genius director Frank Agrama (who shares a very boring commentary track with no less a man than Fred Olen Ray!) tells the story of a group of women and one (allegedly) good looking man (the ever annoying Robin Askwith), who must be protected due to his delicacy by the women at all times. They are making a movie in Africa (in the country of ""Lazanga Where They Do The Conga"") with this loser as the star, when they meet up with Queen Kong. Naturally they bring her back to London where she climbs Big Ben after escaping. Ultimately Robin decides he loves her and they go off into the sunset together.
This film has something for absolutely everyone to hate. Rula Lenska and Robin Askwith are more than a bit annoying as the leading characters, the script is sophomoric (please take special note of the ""Lady Jaws"" special effect for all the evidence of that allegation you will ever need), and the acting is repugnant. I am particularly flabbergasted by the scene in which Rula Lenska speaks ""Unga Bunga"" to her arch enemy. (She speaks all native languages, you know. Typical line: ""Unga bunga, hunga, chunga!"") Also not to be missed are the jaw dropping musical numbers. These numbers (especially the one on the 'Liberated lady', their tugboat that they sail from London to Africa) are far worse than anything from ""The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living And Became Mixed Up Zombies"", the previous touchstone for bad dancing (particularly in the now legendary 'Shook Out Of Shape' number.) Of course I adore TISCWSLABMUZ, and all of the Steckler works, as Ray Dennis Steckler has more talent in his left pinky toe than the makers of this travesty have in their collective bodies. Your ears will also be assaulted with what may possibly be the very worst theme song in movie history. I won't get into that further, just suffice it to say that you may be unprepared for the horror.
True lovers of grade Z movies owe it to themselves to watch this once. You will be numb when you are done, but then you can smile with pride at having watched the unwatchable.  I can't imagine a worse ape film.",1086825600,26,2717,4.5336048879837065
1845777,1,B00008G965,"This one is a real klunker.  I guess some people like this for the camp.  This is full-on 70's campy, but without any retro-cool.  It's supposed to be a comedy, but I can't imagine anyone laughing at it.  The jokes are of the ""unga-bonga"" type. (Those Africans talk so funny don't they.  Please, give me a break.)  Some of the jokes are offending, and the one's that aren't are just plain dull.  The actors are some of the worst I've ever seen.  If you're looking for cheesy movies, I recommend the Mystery Science Theater series instead.  Give this one a miss.",1060905600,2,561,4.475247524752476

The sound and picture quality are a little shaky. I was totally surprised to find an actual directors commentary track but only listened to it for about 10 minutes. I had one major laugh while watching this that made me fall out of my chair, Queen Kong has just escaped from her Command Performance for the Queen and the promoter goes to Queen Elizabeth to apologise and she knees him in the balls.

1845933,1,B00008G965,"Queen Kong is one hour and twenty  four minutes and was released in West Germany on December 10, 1976. Due to legal actions of Producer Dino De Laurentiis, the movie never got released. Dino De Laurentiis was the Producer of the 1976 remake of King Kong. Queen Kong saw limited release in Germany and Italy. Basically Queen Kong is a bad remake of the 1933 King Kong with a female twist. Your lead male actor is a character called Ray Fay, Fay Wray in the original and your lead female actress is a character called Luce Habit, Bruce Cabot in the original King Kong movie.

 Luce Habit spots Fay Wray robbing robing an antique store and drugs him into becoming the lead actor in her new movie. Luce takes Ray to her ship staff by an all-female crew and heads to Africa. Basically that were any similarity between the original and this one ends. Queen Kong fights a Tyrannosaurus and a Pteranodon like in the original, in this one the monsters costumes\designs are so awful and the fighting is a joke. The Pteranodon has a hook on its right foot. The female island natives wear bikinis, not grass skirts and coconut bras. There are several bad song and dance numbers in this movie as well. Queen Kong outfit is a joke, you could tell it is a person in a female ape suit. Since this is a British comedy spoof, then Ray Fay and Queen Kong head up Big Bend. In the end if the British wanted to do a female comedy spoof of King Kong they should of just giving it to Japan where they are the master of making low budget monster movies look good. Their two King Kong movies are proof of that. Queen Kong only gets one star.",1466121600,2,1616,4.344370860927152

It's annoying, irritating, and if you look those up in a thesaurus it's all those other words listed alongside irritating and annoying too.
There is a line they keep repeating, written like it's a joke, spoken like it's a joke, but it's not a joke.  That is the sum of this film, a satire that stabs it's target with a balloon instead of a blade.",1466121600,,499,4.344086021505376

The lyrics to songs are so offensively hilarious, you can't help but laugh. This movie is truly a bazaar of bad jokes and popular culture references layered on top of a simple and quite silly plot. It IS a vehicle for taking the Mickey out of modern society (of it's day).

Definition of camp: something that provides sophisticated, knowing amusement, as by virtue of its being artlessly mannered or stylized, self-consciously artificial and extravagant, or teasingly ingenuous and sentimental. That sums it up perfectly.

So, if you're boring and easily offended-or you actually think this is some kind of sequel to King Kong don't waste your time. However, if you have a sense of humor and like british comedy  la Benny Hill then you have found a gem, a paste gem, but still a gem.",1441411200,2,922,4.644171779141105

1846222,2,B00008G965,"Global Omni-star, Rula Lenska is film Director, Luce Habit. Luce is looking for a leading man for her latest epic. She locates her man in Ray Fay (Robin Askwith- HORROR HOSPITAL, TOWER OF EVIL). After drugging him, they're off from London to Lazanga. With her all-female crew in tow, Luce is all set for filming. Once there, our heroes find the land of Lazanga inhabited by a tribe of mostly female natives. This causes production problems. Of course, this pales in comparison to the trouble caused by the title she-beast! QUEEN KONG is a British parody of its male counterpart (aka: someone in a go-rilla suit). Though fun in spots, it suffers from leaden dialogue, peppered w/ antiquated, anything-but-funny ""jokes"", that couldn't possibly have elicited laughs, even in 1976. Just picture a ""comedy"" film by an oxygen-deprived Benny Hill, complete w/ bikini-clad dancing gals, and you're pretty close to guessing what QK is all about. In addition to the QUEEN, we also get the giant, woman-eating rose bush, and the worst man-in-a-cardboard-dinosaur-costume vs. KONG battle ever conceived! For his part, Askwith appears to be having a blast. Nothing can possibly prepare you for the climactic ""London-rampage"" sequence! Whew! Good luck w/ this bowl of rotten bananas!... P.S.- Who could forget the theme song -apparently written five minutes before its inclusion in the film- by THE ORANGUTANS? It's an air-headed masterwork...",1412640000,3,1429,5.217391304347826

This movie was clearly meant to be a comedy and it was absolutely hilarious. Full of referential humor and classic British sexual farce.

7983580,4,B00008G965,"A very clever parody of King Kong.  It was clear that the writers tried to copy the original film story line faithfully while structuring the parody  in a gender reversal model. I thought the writing was clever, but the acting is strictly 1970's ""C"" class movies.  The character of Ray Fay was needlessly annoying but I guess that is how 1970's type directors felt that a gender reversal should be played for laughs.

Other than that it was an enjoyable parody.  If you are not a fan of the original movie King Kong, you will most likely not like this movie.  It does not stand on its own very well. Try to look past the lousy acting and focus on some pretty clever writing. I am not sure I would want to watch it a second time, but for the first watching, I was entertained and these days, that ain't too bad.",1485907200,2,810,4.296052631578948
