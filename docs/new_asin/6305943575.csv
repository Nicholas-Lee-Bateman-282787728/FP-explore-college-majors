1097320,2,6305943575,"Visually this film is very attractive, with beautiful shots of a lakeside village and very atmospheric shots of alleyways and streets in rain and mist. But when it comes to the actions and motivations of the people  in the film I lost patience. I like to believe in and identify with the characters, and in this film I found that impossible. There are four stories and I will mention only two - the two that seems to me the most bizarre and pointless.
The first story stars two  extremely good-looking newcomers to the screen (Rossi Stuart & Ines Sastre). He stops his car to ask her the way to the nearest hotel;  and, presumably because he is so good-looking, she gives him the name of her hotel. They see each other during the day. and when they retire to their rooms at night across the landing from each other, she lies awake waiting for the knock on the door that never comes. In the morning she leaves early without seeing him. It is two  years before they see each other again, and this time their relationship progresses a little further - they get to be naked on the bed together.
But he behaves in a very odd way indeed; for some five minutes he runs his hands over her body within a millimetre of her skin, but without actually touching her. What she thinks is going on as she lies there feeling nothing, is anybody's guess. Then, after five minutes, still without having touched her, he gets up abruptly and without speaking a word, leaves. I ask you; is that the action of a sane man? You wonder why he bothered to take his clothes off if he intended to do so little. She, presumably feeling hurt and frustrated, rushes to the window to see him walking off into the distance. They give each other a feeble wave. End of story. John Malkovich's deep, lugubrious voice-over tells us he behaved in this way either because of folly or pride. Well it was certainly folly and certainly unbelievable.
In the other story, Malkovich's character is attracted to a young woman (Sophia Marceau) he sees in a shop window. He can't take his eyes off  her and just stands there entranced. She responds in the same way. He  goes into the shop and their mutual and silent fascination continues. I felt uncomfortable for both of them. Was something momentous about to happen? It would seem so and our interest is awakened, our expectations aroused. But no, we are just being led up the garden path.
He sits outside and eventually she joins him. She tells him only one thing about herself; that she has murdered her father by stabbing him twelve  times. Malkovich's character shows no surprise and the fact seems irrelevant. They then go to her place and they have sex. But this is not the beginning of some deep and meaningful relationship. Oh no. When he's had his sex he's had enough, and, like the previous male protagonist, he just walks away. Another wretched piece of behaviour and another let down. The point? I wish I new.",1041897600,16,2925,4.538899430740038
1097321,2,6305943575,"Unless you want to see a film with beautiful locales which this film gets an ""A"" for, this is too long a film to sit through.
There are 4 stories, one of which you are to believe John Malkovich as a sex symbol.  His contribution to the picture is to have the most beautiful woman in the film dying for his body, before he even makes an offer, and then after he beds her, he waves b-bye to her as he's passing outside her window.  Oh, puh-leez.
I wanted to see this film because Vincent Perez, who played a shipwrecked Russian in ""Swept from the Sea"", (an absolutely brilliant 5 star movie I highly recommend. Ian McKlennon and Rachel Weisz are great in it too.), is in this movie.  Unfortunately, his part is not romantic.  The gorgeous man in the first story is also a tease.  Neither of these beautiful men ever completes a lovescene.  (With such ridiculous writing, they could at least give us that!)
Therefore, those of you ladies (and gentlemen who appreciate gorgeous men) will feel a bit cheated.  The females in the movie are just there to be naked and beautiful - which they do well, don't get me wrong!  But they seem to be too willing to go with the flow.
I'm a fan of foreign film but this one will make you say ""you must be kidding"" too many times with its canned monologue.",1028419200,7,1287,4.333333333333333
1097322,4,6305943575,"The great Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni spins four dreamy tales into an uneven but satisfying confection concerning passion and connectivity. Though not as bitter as La Notte and L'Avventura (two of his masterpieces), in this film Antonioni seems more pensive and nostalgic for the tragedy of passing time and lost love. A great cast fills the landscape of lovers trying to connect and passions boiling beneath the surface, some fulfilled, others disappointingly engaged. John Malkovich wanders through the film as a narrator connecting the threads of the four stories (the direction assisted by Wim Wenders due to Antonioni's age and the after effects of a stroke), and the international cast of Peter Weller, Irene Jacob, Vincent Perez, Sophie Marceau and Jean Reno are perfectly tuned in to the director's icy, haunting style. A brief cameo by Marcello Mastroianni and Jeanne Moreau (stars of La Notte) is touching and sad. This film is a must for Antonioni's fans; his scene composition and camerawork are still among the best of any living director.",1018224000,17,1064,5.228070175438597
1097323,2,6305943575,"This movie is about various beautiful young European women who glimpse various balding, middle-aged American men and fall madly in lust with them, pursuing them across rain-swept fishing villages and quaint cafes until the men finally give in and take them home.  This would have been a good formula if the film had been directed by Ron Jeremy, but as it is it's a humiliation.  However, it could be edited down to eight minutes of high-grade nudity.",1008633600,12,450,4.8311688311688314
1097324,4,6305943575,"This is a beautiful set of short films stitched together into one film with Malkovich as a stand in for the wandering director (MA) himself. Malkovich wanders through Italy and France dreamily, gazing, imagining scenarios that spin into tales of now-familiar Antonioni style and presentation. Wim Wenders help cut this film and certainly had a hand in its direction but one has to say, after all, that Antonioni is responsible. He is, like De Kooning doing De Kooning, doing Antonioni. Some of the actors are also straining to do Antonioni and it shows. Despite these shortcomings the handful of scenarios are haunting and the slow cadence of the unraveling of these lives is hypnotic. The film opens with a gorgeous scene of the director (Malkovich) driving through the fog-shrouded streets of Ferrara (one supposes) with strangers drifting through the fog. This seems the pictorial metaphor for the film as a whole.",993772800,11,917,5.079470198675497
1097325,2,6305943575,"As an avid fan of foreign cinema, I had hoped for far more from this film.  While I enjoy savoring slow, brooding, elliptical films (Kieslowski's films largely populate my favorites list), ""Nuages"" simply didn't deliver. The European locales (and various actresses) in the film are frequently gorgeous and beautifully filmed, but precious little is done with this promising milieu.
Not only do the stories lack depth and interest, the characters/actors are unengaging and even obtrusive.  Everyone floats about with this detached, deer-in-the-headlights gaze, mouthing deliberately obscure, overwrought lines that might have come from the pen of some turtleneck-clad, undergraduate philosophy major. There were several moments of unintended humor, when the wearing-my-angst-on-my-sleeve bit crossed the ridiculousness threshold, and left my wife and I laughing aloud. Where Kieslowski's films indirectly but insistently pull you into the urgencies of his protagonists lives, this film opts for the unsubtle; some of these characters might as well be carrying placards noting ""I'm Complex!""  ""I'm emotionally haunted!"" and the like. The one near-exception to this observation was the final vignette, featuring the understated but luminous Irene Jacob.
I found myself wishing that the characters would leave me alone to explore the beguiling backdrops against which these pallid vignettes unfold. I don't think that was the director's intent.",982022400,14,1440,5.815165876777251
1097326,5,6305943575,"Here's another Antonioni masterpiece (assisted and with a few connecting scenes directed by Wim Wenders) that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as enough people see it on DVD. I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time (even in metropolitan movie capital L.A.!) for a couple of weeks and then disappeared (art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory, where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiosities).

At first I was disappointed, thought the pace unbearably boring (how can anyone sit through this thing more than once?), and that the man had lost a chance (for years Antonioni had found it difficult to find financing) at an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon. But, remembering how I had reacted negatively to ""Blow-Up"" and ""The Passenger"" and later completely reversed my opinion, I refused to pass judgment until I had seen it again.

I went back th! e next day and I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SURPRISED that the film kept pulling me in, making me aware of things I had thought about and lost track of throughout my life. These were the same truths exposed for the first time some forty years ago in 'L'Aventurra,''La Notte,' 'L'Eclisse,' and 'Red Desert,' transposed to a contemporary setting, and they were just as fascinating as ever! The slow, drawn-out meditative moods, the famous ""alienated tone,"" and above all, the subtle comedic subtext underlying everything-I just couldn't get enough.

The (Wenders directed but deeply Antonioni influenced)scene with Malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach, sand swirling by, with the weather so beautifully silver-skied, and the Eno/U2 track in the background flowing through at just the shot's rhythm--this had been my favorite on first viewing: it still was, but now the whole film was almost as great. What a strange phenomenon, that special brand of 'complex s! implicity' or 'invisible complex' which Antonioni's eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate (and influence Wenders to do like-wise when collaborating).

""Beyond the Clouds"" looks at first glance like a soft-core porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex (the maddeningly gorgeous Sophie Marceau alone should be enough to distract the males in the audience), but make no mistake about it, its sensibility is timeless and unmistakably Antonioni's to its core; however, you will not sense to what a profound extent, until you have seen the film a few times and got used to its rhythm (I saw it 4 times before they pulled it and would've gone back for more). If this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it, I have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of Antonioni's '60s films. But the '60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on letterboxed DVD (I'll never f! orgive the morons who released those cut-up versions of 'Zabriskie Point' and 'The Passenger' on video) some 5 years after its initial release. I urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see 'Beyond the Clouds' and add a touch of magic to the tragic.",968716800,46,3192,4.808743169398907
1097327,5,6305943575,"I love this movie so much that I will be the first one in line to buy the DVD.
For those of you who love well-designed plots, like those of Manon of the Spring or Sixth Sense, you may be disappointed by the stories in  this movie.  All four stories were not linked in any meaningful way.
The  first story was about a young man, who secretly fell in love with a  beautiful young woman (In&egrave;s Sastre) that he met in a street.  It was the  kind of Platonic love in which he loved her spiritually but feared that  physical attachment would destroy this relationship.  It reminds me of John  Cage and Nelle Porter in the Ally McBeal show. Only they were more  innocent.
The second story was a bizarre one.  John Malkovich and Sophie  Marceau were two mysterious strangers who met in a small shop on the shore  of a beautiful lake (or sea?).  They felt connected in some way that was  not easily understandable to the audience.
The third story was about a  love triangle in a big city.  This story was all so familiar and boring  too.
In the last story, a beautiful girl (Irene Jacob) was walking to a  church.  A young man volunteered to walk with her in the rain.  They talked  about life and love.  When the girl got back home, she told the boy that  she was going to enter a convention the day after.  The boy left in  despair.  Obviously, the girl was kind of lost too.
What I love most  about this movie is the beautiful places.  I love the foggy street and cozy  hotel of Ferrara, the beach shops and ivy-covered walls of Portofino, and  the streets of Paris in rainy days.  These places look so beautiful and  lovely that I just want to jump in the screen like the waitress in The  Purple Rose of Cairo.
Sastre, Marceau and Jacob look phenomenal in this  movie.  Reno (well known as Leon in The Professional) and Malkovich have  good performance too.  When Malkovich plays a serious movie director and  observes people's life, it's more funny than serious.
People may feel  lost in the clouds after seeing this movie.  Actually, this is not a  down-to-earth or sci-fi Hollywood movie at all.  These stories happen  everyday in the world, when I was watching it, I felt I knew these  characters all along.  Antonioni did not intend to teach you about the  meaning of life, love, desire, and betrayal, on the contrary, he tried to  help you to experience or to understand your experience through the eyes of  the camera.  It works fine with me.",960854400,32,2450,4.444444444444445
1097539,4,6305943575,Excellent quality and it was not censored made it much easier to follow .Even the subtitles were better than the previous film,1362441600,4,126,4.7727272727272725
1097540,1,6305943575,Poor quality film and it was not advertised that it was censored with a large black dot. European films are hard enough to follow as is,1362441600,3,135,4.230769230769231
1097541,4,6305943575,"A summing up of all the aging, ailing Antonioni's career themes,  His strengths (visual beauty, a sense of mystery and poetry) and weaknesses (pretentious stiff dialogue, ideas that are sometimes not really all that deep, a penchant for getting beautiful actresses undressed without a lot of justification... not that it isn't enjoyable...).

But this is also something quite different than he's ever done, in that these are a series of short stories, loosely tied together by sequences of John Malkovich playing a director looking for his next film (Wim Wenders helped the physically limited Antonioni by directing the Malkovich sections).

By keeping the pieces smaller,  I found this more fun, and more moving than most of Antonioni's films.  There isn't the chance for the ideas to run as thin, and there seems to be more empathy for his characters now.  Humans may be screwed up, but Antonioni no longer stands above them judging.  One moment actually brought me near tears.

The film captures the lonely enigmatic solitude of the artist, and of life itself.",1297987200,7,1063,5.068965517241379
1097542,3,6305943575,"This film was Antonioni's first after a long hiatus from filmmaking.  There are interlinking segments with John Malkovich as a film director that were directed by Wim Wenders, but overall, it's an Antonioni film.  While there are some great shots and camerawork, it just felt empty.  It's like one reviewer said:  it was ""Antonioni doing Antonioni"".  I kept looking for something profound and worthwhile, like in Michelangelo's masterpieces from L'avventura to Blow-Up (and The Passenger), but usually came away empty.  Aside from one story with a woman who reveals to her lover that she's about to become a nun, none of the stories generate much interest, and Wenders's segments are incredibly pretentious, with ponderous, condescending narration.  The film is worth checking out if you dig Antonioni (Marcello Mastrioanni's segment is quite good), but overall, it's a rather staid exercise with some thoughtful, Antonioniesque moments.",1240790400,,937,5.465277777777778
1097543,4,6305943575,"This film is a genuine piece of art.  If you are looking for Hollywooden action or a love story with a happy ending, then pass it up.  If you can appreciate art for art's sake then you are going to love this masterpiece.  Watch this film without trying to figure out what is taking place with each scene or segment, or without expectation and you will be rewarded with the brilliance of imagery and beauty.  It has great architectural scenes, nice city and countryside vistas, and gorgeous nude women.  It is very slow paced, but sped up with choppy editing.  From what I gathered from this movie the director is creating the image that mankind is alone and lonely no matter who or what he chooses to be with - his imagination, beautiful potential lovers, beautiful lovers, beautiful wives and mistresses or God and the Church.  If you cannot appreciate this viewpoint while disagreeing with it, then I would again suggest you pass on it.  Certainly if you agree with this viewpoint you will love it because the director paints it starkly and brilliantly.  You need to watch the whole movie and maybe even contemplate it for awhile after viewing it to absorb the impact and genius of it.  Many minutes of this film are spent with characters walking without speaking, standing looking silently, etc.  If you fast forward just to get to the nude scenes, which are definitely worth watching, you will miss the impact of the movie.  There is a narrator who wanders through lives and cities tying all segments together, whose narration seems to be mumbling more to himself than narrating to the viewers.  He too is searching, ostensibly and otherwise.  Once again, if you like art for art's sake I think you will appreciate this, otherwise, I doubt it.",1236902400,4,1747,4.7227722772277225
1097544,4,6305943575,"If you speak French or can put up with sub-titles, you will really enjoy this movie. If on the other hand you just want to see God's most beautiful creatures, this is a must see. Not an ounce of silicon in sight. Zalman King eat your heart out. Sophie Marceau's body is the epitome of perfection and everything I had ever fantasized about. Her part is even in English. Even the fact that she was nude with John Malkovich did not detract for her beauty. Sophie is a ten if ever there was one. Chiara Caselli and Ins Sastre are 9.5s. Oh yeah, it is a pretty good story. Several little vignettes are woven together in a sort of Six Degrees of Separation style.",1182556800,4,657,4.306451612903226
1097545,5,6305943575,"Wow. I have never witnessed a movie so beautiful and haunting. It really feels like you are there, in the city, witnessing the lives of these amazingly human characters. The huge buildings really are like old ""bones growing out from under the fog,"" and inside this vast timeless landscape are the humans' who's hopes are infinite yet must face the harsh limits of their own flaws and weaknesses. These beautiful love stories evoked a strange and transcendeding feeling from my heart. I can't really put words on it. They were real, surreal, and eternal. There is a indescribable and unseen dimension to everything in this film: the lives of those living inside the great buildings, the enigmatic little streets covered with fog and rain.

Watch this movie alone and with the lights off. I promise you will experience something hauntingly beautiful that will stay with you for a lifetime.",1169769600,4,887,4.953020134228188

Then when they meet again and she lies (...)--he hardly touches her--is this guy nuts?,1105401600,3,370,4.152777777777778
1097547,5,6305943575,"This summer I read Nathaniel Dorsky's book ""Devotional Cinema"" and looked at many of the movies he regards as being capable of getting us in touch with our deeper human nature. Among those mentioned were several Antonioni films that have to do with the relationship between men and women. In ""La Notte"" of crucial importance to the male writer depicted in the movie is woman as muse.

 Antonioni revists this theme in ""Beyond the Clouds"" as he shows how he goes about the creative process of making a film. The sequence of roles played by the women in the different relationships depicted is fascinating. I suggest watching the movie several times and reading Mr. Dorsky's book to get the most out of this gem.",1091491200,9,710,4.717741935483871

Every person can read the texts (it can be texts in the books and in the films and anywhere else as well - all our world is the text for reading and understanding) using some interpretative codes, which he has by force of his education and his environment.

The film is absolutely beautiful to see, but the 4 stories (or scenarios) do not convey much power, and are not very well connected.
Much of the dialog is pretentious, esp. that of Malkovich, who I guess is a representation of Antonioni himself. Its even silly at times.
You don't get any of those wonderfully cinematic and profound Antonioni moments, like the last minutes of LEclisse or The Passenger, or the awesome compositions of Red Desert, indelible images that define the feeling of the film, and stay in memory forever.
