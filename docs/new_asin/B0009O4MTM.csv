Paul plays Silver Man, a talented violinist who plays by a beach and sells tapes. He falls in love with the girl in the apartment next to him Tivoli who is with Jake. Jake treats her badly and when Tivoli finally gets rid of him and falls for the mysterious and gentle Silver Man.

Overall I loved this film for the acting and the script, with one exception. While I realise that the character of Jake is not a nice person the influx of one particular offensive word from his mouth was at times a little too much. If the swearing had just been toned down a little then I would have given it 5 stars.

This is a great movie, but it isn't a movie for children due to the content.",1211760000,,817,4.158227848101266
