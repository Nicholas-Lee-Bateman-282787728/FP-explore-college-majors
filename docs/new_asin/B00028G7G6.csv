2068764,1,B00028G7G6,"This has got to be the worst movie I have seen in every catagory imaginable. From acting, to production & direction, this one should be burned into eternity.

I for one enjoy urban movies, but this movie if you want to even call it a movie, is absolutely horrible. Don't bother to waste your time or money. You couldn't go wrong by choosing another movie...ANY movie would be better!!!",1158364800,,385,4.579710144927536

The one-star rating is WAY too generous, unfortunately I can't give anything lower. I can't understand how in the world anyone would even ponder releasing this junk.

8023958,3,B00028G7G6,"They did the best they could with such a low budget. It was fun but you could definitely see the heavy ""Friday"" influence in the film. This film just falls waaaaay short of that iconic movie. Valiant effort tho",1468800000,,210,4.410256410256411

8023963,1,B00028G7G6,Couldn't get past the first few minutes without giving up on it. Low budget film with low budget actors talking about same old stereotype of our black brothers never being up to any good. Didn't watch it.,1445558400,,204,4.54054054054054

8023965,5,B00028G7G6,"This is a funny movie in places but don't expect this to be a side spliting movie.  This movie is likely more  fun if you are a student of black hip culture and black slang.  I am a black man but my understanding of urban black culture was, is and shall always be rather limited.  The sad part about Out on Parole  are the situations it depicts are often true.  It is very hard for a black man once incarcerated to ever dig himself out from under the taint that prison or jail mark him with.

As a black man who has never had dealings with the criminal injustice system it is hard enough for me to live in the police state that is today's United States of America.  I actually got stopped by the Baltimore City Police department for looking at a sandwich container with too much interest.  I was stopped the policemen said because, my attention to my sandwich was so unusual I needed to be stopped.  They felt I might have drugs hidden in my sandwich.  I share this with you because; you will see black men abused and humiliated in this video and while it is meant to be funny it is also a true reflection of how black men are treated when on parole.

As a black man who has never had any contact with the parole system life on these racist streets is hard enough for me.  I looked at Out on Parole and sadly the treatment these men endured was not funny it was sad, pathetic and depressing.  Out on Parole is funny in places but it is also so true in some places it hurts.  Out on Parole  earned five stars from me not because of its comedy.  The comedy was there and it was ok.  Out on Parole  got five stars from me because; it woke me up to the indignities and no win situations black men face when Out on Parole.

I don't live in the inner city.  Even when I lived in the ghetto my autism tended to insulate me from the realities of the urban black man's prison experience.  Out on Parole brought home the no win, pain, suffering and indignity of the parole experience.  I know Out on Parole  was not meant as an education video it was supposed to be comedy.  However Out on Parole  educated me in ways so profound I lack words to explain it.  I must respect black men who are Out on Parole for this video shows they have the priceless ability to laugh at themselves in adversity and that makes them far better human beings than I will ever be.",1417392000,2,2349,4.173719376391982
