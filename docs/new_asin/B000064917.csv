7960604,5,B000064917,"I got this tape a month after I gave birth...I watched it a couple of times, before getting the green light from my doctor to start excercising.  Even though I had remained active during my pregnancy, I had gained 30 lbs.  The tape is absolutely challenging...it goes thru a warm-up, a 30 min. aerobic workout, and 5 min cool-down.  The aerobic part is fun and energetic, very straight forward.  It's not dancy, which I liked, because I wanted something serious to get back in shape.  I tried to work out four to five times a week while my son napped.  Initially, my joints hurt, and I did the low impact version on a lot of the excercises, because I was so out of shape.  After a couple of weeks, my body stopped hurting, and I started getting stronger.  By the time I went back to work, 3 months after I gave birth, and a month and a half after I started doing the workout, I had lost ALL my pregancy weight, and better yet, started getting very defined legs--no big hips anymore...all my pre-pregancy clothes fit better than ever, and people complemented me on looking better than I did before the pregnancy.  Well, it's been almost a year, and I still do the workout at least 3 times a week, and I've lost an additional five pounds.  It's still very challenging...I sweat, and my heart rate gets right up there. It also relieves a lot of the stress of dealing with a 10 month old baby who's teething and beginning to walk, and gives me energy to keep going thru the day. I highly recommend it to whomever wants to get back in shape, in only 35 minutes a day.  It is the BEST workout you'll get.",1081296000,11,1598,4.346801346801347
