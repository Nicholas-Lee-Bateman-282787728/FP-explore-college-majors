Also, we have owned it for a year now and my son's love for it has not faded.  He sings the songs all the time which is hilarious because they are traditional Christmas songs with ""train"" lyrics, so when we are singing together he sings it one way and I mess up and sing the traditional words.  I get corrected all the time.",1387324800,,447,4.103448275862069
1934871,1,B0000E3J8D,Did not like it! not such a good video. The only nice thing is the trains but the videos are kind of annoying.,1384300800,,110,3.8260869565217392
1934872,1,B0000E3J8D,"This video is interesting for model builders that want some ideas. For watching with the kids, this video is extremely boring. We watched it with our grandkids, ages 4 to 9. They laughed  and mocked the music and lyrics. All three begged me top turn it off.  I would not waste the time or money on this video if you are looking for something interesting and entertaining for the kids at christmas. If you are a model builder, you may get some ideas for your project.",1355443200,,466,4.406976744186046
1934873,5,B0000E3J8D,"You have never had a toy train, not even at Chritsmas? Neither have I, but these videos are so much more than that, they are memories you forgot you had, they are Chritmas sights that your heart and soul tell you -- this is what Christmas should be. They are like seeing the tree all lit up on Chritmas Morning when you were a kid. They are a much needed pause in our busy lives. We have owned this for 3 or 4 Christmas' now and no matter how old or young when I put this on  all conversation slowly dies away as everyone in the room is lured by the nostalgic scenes and the ideas from their memories and of what Christmas is when Christmas is at it's best.
Another thing that is really nice is this is a 3 part DVD and it runs long, so it can be watched in the 3 different parts each running about an hour and you do not see the same video over and over, making it a great value for the money. My grandchildren love to watch it even when it is not Christmas, and it is the first DVD requested to be played during the holiday season.  Makes you feel like when you were a child and everything was right with your world.  Very rare to be able to buy that priceless feeling.",1319673600,8,1171,4.017167381974249
