7836179,3,6303077684,"This is an ok film about a woman who was disinherited by her rich Boston parents because she could not give up card gambling, which she is very good at. It is also about a bounty hunter with an equally strange past and about the lady's cousin who is always with her who cannot stand not being with her, who has always protected her since they were children together.
The bounty hunter kills a wanted man and the mans three friends are hunting him to kill him in revenge. The lady gambles and wins a brothel.
We watch and wonder: What is the relationship between the lady and her cousin? Will there be a relationship ending in marriage with the bounty hunter? What is the history of the bounty hunter? Can the lady sell the bordello for more than it is worth, for the exorbitant price she wants?",1461542400,,794,4.371621621621622

something that happens occasionally and I  would buy from them again.

This rating was given due to the issues below:

Picture was fuzzy looking (out of focus). Colors looked faded (washed out).
I would like to rate it higher, but cannot.

I would not recommend it others.",1381017600,,342,4.557377049180328

7836182,4,6303077684,"A gambling lady (Elizabeth Taylor, looking sensational) wins a house in a poker game. The house turns out to be a brothel. While she tries to unload the house on her terms, she must deal with the rivalry between her cousin and traveling companion (George Hamilton) and the bounty hunter (Tom Skerritt) she's fallen in love with. Directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman, this is a breezy and diverting western which, although filled with the cliches of the genre, provides Taylor with a strong central role that allows her to take center stage with the command of a true Star. The film's low point is when it stoops to a cheesy cat fight between Taylor (or rather Taylor's obvious stunt double) and Susan Tyrell as one of the prostitutes she's inherited. Filmed in Arizona. With Richard Mulligan, David Wayne (HOW TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE) and Liz Torres.

The Boulevard Entertainment DVD from Great Britain is an adequate full frame 1.33 (it was shot for television) transfer.",1329868800,2,969,4.872727272727273
