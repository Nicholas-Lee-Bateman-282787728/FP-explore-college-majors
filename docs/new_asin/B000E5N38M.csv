8106340,5,B000E5N38M,I enjoyed the workout.  A lot of lunges and swats.  This exercise routine works every part of your body.,1291939200,,104,4.421052631578948
8106341,3,B000E5N38M,"this was a good work out but if you expect to learn how to dance sexy like a stripper DO NOT GET THIS DVD! this is all basically squats and lunges and other resistance. i was disappointed b/c i wanted to do an excercise i could use later...for my husband and this is DEFINATELY NOT IT. so if you want a workout like all the others, go ahead and get this one.",1217894400,4,358,3.986111111111111
8106342,5,B000E5N38M,"I really enjoyed this workout!  After the five-minute aerobic-style warm-up, Tricia leads two other exercisers in a 20-minute standing leg workout: side lunges, front lunges, ski squats, plies, etc.  She jokes around with the others as well; when they are holding a chair squat for 30 seconds, she turns and asks, ""have you got any good jokes?""  This sort of humor adds to the overall good, fun feeling.  After the standing work, it's to the mats (or mattresses, the only possible concession to ""sexy"" that I can see here) for 15 minutes of floor work, which includes both ab work (crunches, side planks, etc.) and leg/butt work (something where you are lying on your side with your legs piked out so your body is in an ""L"" position and you lift your top leg up and down, bring your knee in, etc.; whew, those were tougher than they looked!)  Tricia doesn't do the work here, lucky woman, she instructs the other two exercisers on what do do.  This is followed by a very nice 5-minute stretch.  The music is great throughout the entire workout; club-style, with songs that I recognized (i.e., ""Hot, Hot, Hot), but never too loud or intrusive.  Between Trish's humor, her previewing the moves and providing excellent cuing, the great music and the effective exercises, this was one terrific workout!",1180051200,3,1298,4.789237668161435
8106343,4,B000E5N38M,"This workout definitely gets my heartrate up and my thighs and abs are sore the next day. The floor set with all of the crunches feels like some sort of torture but the results are totally worth it.

However I do have to say that production values are lacking a little. My biggest gripe is that they wear black and the background is black. I like to see what they are doing just a little better.",1175126400,,395,4.197368421052632
8106344,2,B000E5N38M,I really didn't like this video.  The picture was bad quality and they didn't seem to be doing anything out of the ordinary.  I found it boring and it was a lot more than other ones I have purchased and loved. (The Biggest Loser),1173052800,,229,4.181818181818182
8106345,5,B000E5N38M,"Wow is all I can say. I love this work out! I have tenditis in both knees so it's been difficult for me to find a work out to help with this. I usually give up from fatigue or lose interest, or feel as if the work out is out of my league. But Tricia encourages you to finish. In the past I could only fully complete yoga videos, but I completed this work out on the first day! I love it and recommend it to all beginners. You really feel it the next day, so don't skip the stretches at the end of the work out.",1160092800,2,510,3.7757009345794392
8106346,5,B000E5N38M,"I love this video!  It's a great workout and you can really feel it in your abs and butt.  Tricia is a wonderful instructor; some instructors come across as really annoying but Tricia always seems like she's having a great time.  I would recommend this to everyone, especially people who have a hard time making it to the gym and prefer to stay home.",1157500800,2,350,4.4375
8106347,5,B000E5N38M,"This is just straight aerobic w/hand weights, this is not a dance workout. I don't normally like straight aerobics, but I got this as a gift.
The set is simple black with red curtains & Tricia is accompanied by two professional fitness trainers.
There's a warm up with some toe touches, squats & traveling steps, nothing hard, to move fast & get the heart rate up for 5 min.
Next is 15 min leg workout with lunges & hand weights if you want but can be done without. There are more squats, wide squats, etc. When you get sick of that, she seems to know & switches to more simple traveling steps to get your heart going again & moving. I love the move of putting 1 leg far behind & touching the floor, nice bit of balance, moving, stretching & gets the heart going. There's also chair pose in yoga, wide legged horse pose or grand plie in ballet.
Last is the floor workout where the two women demonstrate & Tricia guides. She starts with 6 diff positions of crunches, side lifts, plank position in yoga (awesome ab strengthener), leg lifts in a 90 degree angle I've never seen before. She lets you stretch in between doing one side of the body then the other. More crunches then some good stretching for a few minutes to end.
The music is pretty good, starts out what you'd normally hear in a gym, but then seems to get better with time. At first it feels like a gym class you're in, but with Tricia's down to earth nature, I also felt like I was working out with a girlfriend in a bedroom (the bed looking ""mat"" on the floor work might have helped with that, it was different & cute idea).
I didn't get bored like I normally do on almost all straight aerobics classes or dvds. With so many diff crunches & leg workouts, I just did some other ones while they did ones that would normally overwork my tight knees, such as doing the grand plies while they did lunges.
Tricia did much better on here, she never counted, she'll only say in a positive way, ""come on, you can do a few more"" like a friend would, being honest it's hard, but ""hey, you have any jokes to tell to make the time pass"" which really worked. She was good about reminding you on posture & how not to cheat. She taught slowly only a few step moves that might need it, she didn't allow too much rest, but just a second or two & switching things up before you can get bored. She I also like she did many different things to work the same muscles to give it more variety.",1147478400,17,2433,4.245689655172414
