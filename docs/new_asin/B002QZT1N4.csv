3969209,4,B002QZT1N4,"Kaminey is one of the best Indian movies I have seen in recent times - it is an intelligent, gritty thriller with a clever story line and excellent performances. Shahid Kapoor proves his mettle with his double-role, the dialogues are crisp, and photography features the bylanes of Mumbai where most of the story takes place. The songs are worth humming. All in all a complete package worth savoring. If you are looking for a typical Bollywood fare, you will be ""disappointed"". Enjoying this movie requires you to apply your brain.",1255132800,2,530,4.9
3969210,2,B002QZT1N4,"This movie did surprisingly very well and Shahid Kapoor earned well deserved praise. I guess he is close to becoming the next Bollywood hero. He is not bad for another muscle-puffed Bollywood actor. These actors need to decide if they are going to spend time building muscles or getting to the business of acting and doing it well. In this particular case, Shahid Kapoor comes through and does a good job of playing the dual roles of twins - one bad, the other good. It's the story that does not connect the dots for me in a way that makes it understandable or coherent as to how the brothers' personalities are different and why one of them chooses a life of crime. It's not fluid. The dark theme of the film supports the premise of the story I suppose. But again the story and its narration has no substance. It's too bad because this film could have been a lot better. I like Shahid Kapoor by the way and look forward to his next film with Rani Mukherji.",1254614400,2,957,4.382022471910112
3969211,5,B002QZT1N4,"You can't believe how much anticipation I had for this movie(I loved Awarapan, also a gangster movie). This movie passed each expectation. Amazing songs(especially the title track and Dhan Te Nan), enthralling action, mind-blowing story, shocking performances(in a good way), and an ecstatic execution through and through. Shahid's performance along with Priyanka's, Amole Gupte's and everyone's performace make me speechless. They all fit in their roles. Shahid as Charlie steals the show. Priyanka looked her best in Dostana, but she looks angelic with no makeup(and still hot).

What I liked about the movie:
Shahid, Priyanka, Amole, action, run-out of the mill songs(especially the ones mentioned above), photography BEST FILM OF THE YEAR. MY FAVORITE BOLLYWOOD MOVIE EVER.

What I didn't like about the movie:
Too short, like Awarapan. Come on, 135 minutes? What about 150, at least?!",1254355200,3,889,5.481751824817518

8378182,1,B002QZT1N4,"This is my second stab at this review, since Amazon, for whatever random reason, did not approve my previous review.

I am making another attempt, as I believe my comments will be extremely useful to customers buying this item.

Before you purchase ""Kaminey"" or any other feature film from India, verify with your seller that it is not distributed by Moserbaer!

I purchased this DVD, believing it to be the UTV version, as the seller included the notation ""original company releases"" in their product details, and UTV is the original company that produced ""Kaminey"".

Instead, much to my disgust, the seller sent me the Moserbaer version. Why disgust? Let me tell you:

This DVD - and, as I have learned, most product from Moserbaer - features:

* A large ""Moserbaer"" watermark in the upper left-hand corner of the screen - this watermark remains throughout the entire movie. Since ""Kaminey"" has an aspect ratio of 2.39:1, when letterboxed on a standard 4:3 television screen, this watermark takes up quite a bit of screen space. And, if that weren't enough . . .

* Large footers, much like those on commercial/cable television networks, pop up frequently throughout the movie to advertise Moserbaer's website. They even pop up during action scenes.

I will never buy one of the Moserbaer DVDs again.

What I don't understand is how these people think such ad pollution will draw traffic to their business; on the contrary, it drives traffic away from their business. Who wants to continue ordering DVDs when they are filled with this junk?",1361318400,6,1542,4.922779922779923
8378183,4,B002QZT1N4,"I tried watching it as ""pay-per-view"" in 2009. Could not endure it and switched the TV off without wtching the whole movie. Watched it again yesterday - this time a DVD and I actually liked the movie. Moral of the story - replay a work of art in the format in which the creator intends you to.",1315785600,,293,4.157894736842105
8378184,5,B002QZT1N4,"Director Vishal Bhardwaj--best known for his film adaptations of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' ('Maqbool') and 'Othello' ('Omkara')--breaks new ground in Bollywood with his latest creation: a violent, convoluted, Tarantino-esque trip through the mean streets of Mumbai--stellar soundtrack and all. But the Bard's influence is still apparent in Bhardwaj's work, particularly in the double role played by Shahid Kapoor, that of twins--a symbol of fragmented identity as common in Indian films as it is in Shakespeare's plays--and here the brothers, Charlie and Guddu, are at odds with themselves as well as each other. Kapoor sheds his trademark boyishness and transforms into two rugged, world-weary men--both broken in their own unique way, both in need of redemption. Charlie fixes horse races but loses everything when a jockey double-crosses him. Guddu does street theater with his girlfriend Sweety--who is anything but--to promote AIDS awareness. Played by a de-glammed Priyanka Chopra (who will surely win awards for her performance), Sweety is as indomitable as her crooked family and she bulldozes Guddu into getting her pregnant and marrying her. The estranged brothers both get into trouble with the mob and only they can extricate each other from the desperate mess their lives have become. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bollywood-Ticket/dp/B002Q0WPWS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bollywood Ticket</a>)",1255478400,9,1530,6.187793427230047
