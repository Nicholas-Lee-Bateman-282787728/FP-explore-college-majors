7937718,1,B00005BJ9N,"Whatever you do, DON'T buy this version of Die Entfuhrung unless you already have every other available DVD!
The problem's not the quality of the singing or the caliber of the reproduction technology.
The problem is that the producer, a certain Hans Neuenfels, decided it would be a good idea to outsmart Mozart and his librettist, Johann Stephanie, by splitting each of the singing roles between a singer and a similarly clad actor or actress, so that they could have bizarre conversations between themselves, and follow themselves around the stage. The effect is jarring, unsettling, distracting, and (according to my wife) nauseating.
I've awarded the production a single star only because Amazon won't accept a review without at least one star.",1422489600,2,748,5.190082644628099
7937719,5,B00005BJ9N,"I absolutely loved this version of ""Die Entfuhrung Aus Dem Serail.""  It is colorful, funny, and sexy.  I'm usually not a big fan of post-modern productions or when they make changes in the libretto but in this case I felt it all worked to make it more enjoyable.

If you have read other reviews, you know that this production is going to divide people.  You will probably either really love it or really hate it.  Obviously, I really enjoyed it.  This was the first production that made me realize how similar to ""The Magic Flute,"" this opera is.

If you love Mozart and you are the adventurous type, you should give this version of ""Die Entfuhrung Aus Dem Serail"" a try.",1253318400,,671,4.4958677685950414
7937720,4,B00005BJ9N,"One of Germany's most cutting edge opera houses, The Stuttgart State Opera, hired Hans Neuenfels in 1998 to prepare a new version of Entfuhrung.  The result was voted Production of the Year in the annual Opernwelt awards, and is presented on DVD here.  The orchestra is first rate, and though some of the singers seemed weak to me (e.g. Matthias Klink as Belmonte), they certainly didn't detract from Mozart's sublime score.

Neuenfels took the concept of singspiel and turned it into sing/spiel by dividing each of the roles into a singer and an actor.  So, 2 Belmontes, 2 Osmins, 2 Pedrillos, 2 Blondes, and 2 Konstanzes (the exception is Pasha Selim, whom Mozart didn't give anything to sing).  But it's not so simple as giving the spoken dialogue to the Actor and the sung to the Singer.  Neuenfels cut much of Gottlieb Stephanie the Younger's original libreto and  wrote a great deal of new dialogue so that the characters are often interacting with themselves or with each others doppelgangers (or even with the orchestra)!

If you like your operas to be old-fashioned stand-and-deliver warhorses in which tradition and the score rule, this production is not for you.  On the other hand, if you find opera to be staid, you ought to give this a try.  I thought it was brilliant.",1237680000,3,1283,4.790909090909091
7937721,2,B00005BJ9N,"This was a very disappointing performance, and I question why it was chosen for a DVD. The singing is acceptable, but not what I would consider to be especially inspired. The root of the problem is the production. I was so looking forward to adding this DVD to my collection, as this ranks as one of my favorite operas--thank goodness I checked it out at the library first! It just is not a captivating performance, and it is far too untraditional for my taste. Surely a much better version of this opera will come along on DVD. Until then, you're better off enjoying it on CD and leave the visuals to your mind. It is doubtful your imagination will conjure up anything like this production of annoying mirror images! It is disturbing to say the least and it does nothing to enhance our understanding of Mozart or this opera.",1005523200,10,825,4.543624161073826
7937722,4,B00005BJ9N,"You may find shocking to see all the characters, except the Pasha, splitted in two: the singer and the actor,  and interacting mutually, but you will finally enjoy it. You must take into account that this is not a typical Opera but a Singspiel that has not a rigid libretto and the dialogues are opened to improvisation. I found the two female singers (Catherine Naglestad playing Constanze and Kate Ladner playing Blonde)quite good, as well as the tenor playing Pedrillo and the baritone playing Osmin. I recommend it to all Opera lovers.",1005350400,8,539,4.858695652173913
7937723,1,B00005BJ9N,"To see all the characters played by TWO people is truly annoying.  For example, there are always two constanzes on stage, two blonchens, and two everyone...The singing is average, the stage is modern...it does not reflect traditional mozart style.",1004400000,10,247,5.333333333333333
