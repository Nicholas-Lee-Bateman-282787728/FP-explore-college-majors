8193999,4,B000Q0X5II,"Believe this may be Garden Of Delight's very first DVD release and also the label's first piece that comes packaged in the digi-pack format. The DVD's first three tracks are from a German TV special that was initially broadcast on October 18, 1970. ""All Green"" is basically a good jazz-fusion work out for the band as the DVD title track ""Talking To My Soul"" features a cool state-of-the-art liquid light show  - including the image of a giant eye several times and ""Oszillogram"" has all the making of a truly great krautrock song with a nice flow to it that had the band playing in top form. The thirty-six minute television show was pulled from the SWF series vaults. The previously mentioned song ""Talking To My Soul"" would make a fantastic TV promo video. Personnel: Hansi Fischer - flute & soprano sax, Ocki Brevern (R.I.P.) - keyboards, Tim Belbe - tenor sax, Klaus Briest - bass and Skip - drums. Picture and sound quality is great. Plus, Garden Of Delights took the time and effort to tag on something to this DVD that I certainly didn't expect. Two live songs from a couple of XHOL reunion gigs from 2003-04 of members sax player Tim Belbe and Hansi Fischer on flute. Both segments are more or less of a 'straight-shoot' from a single angle, but the quality is still fine. Something that I failed to notice until a bit later - this is a two-sided DVD that appears to have the same program on both sides. Final pitch - this DVD comes with the traditional Garden Of Delights 26-page (but, who's counting?) informative booklet packed with info, rarely-seen artwork and band memorabilia. Chalk up another must-have title on your krautrock want list.",1319068800,,1654,4.683848797250859
