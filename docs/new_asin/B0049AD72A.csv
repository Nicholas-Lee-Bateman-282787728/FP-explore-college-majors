8561087,5,B0049AD72A,"It drove me mad at first. This obsession with a mystical term that every China worn expat boardroom battler you encounter in the 5 star hotel bars seems to verbally parry and riposte each other with. The term of course is Guanxi (slurred as Gwan Shee) normally roughly translated into English as ""relationship"" - as deep a meaning of the term as translating Confucius as ""the man with a long beard"". So what does it mean, whats the point of it and why do business people in China spend so much time in 5 star hotel bars.

Now I am rambling. Let me get back on the subject. My take on this DVD/Booklet is that it simply shows to a bloke coming to China how to steer business decision outcomes though the use of Guanxi  - in it's most ethical sense. The author (Full disclosure:I have seen him in business negotiations with Chinese bureaucrats) brutally reveals how - when correctly deployed - Guanxi reduces risk for a foreign businessman.

As you watch the DVD and start to become familiar with the mechanics of Guanxi you will probably find yourself uncannily forming your own definitions of the term and the power it truly wields. I think I have about 20 variations so far.",1292198400,,1175,4.533018867924528
8561088,5,B0049AD72A,"Having lived and worked in China since the early 1980s, I know firsthand just how complex Chinese business culture can be.  Micah's concise, practical advice reminded me of the things I had forgotten, sharpened areas where I'd become slack and gave me a few new ideas.  The ""China Etiquette Pack"" is well worth the investment for Old China Hands, those just entering the China market and everyone in-between.

8561089,5,B0049AD72A,"These days there are many books -  actually a *glut* of books - about China business.  Many of those titles are nothing more than skin-deep and superficial and/or quickly become irrelevant soon after rolling off the printing presses.  Micah Truman's book and accompanying video is not only deeply relevant right now, but a classic on China business that will stand the test of time as well.

I've personally gone 'all in' here in the Middle Kingdom. For the past 14 years I've called China home and plan to raise my two boys 'Made in China' here so I'll most likely be here for another 14 years on top of that.  If I could have had access to these materials when I first landed in China, I would have hungrily and eagerly consumed them which I'm certain would have saved me money, time and face.

Even after more than a decade of building up valuable scar tissue as an entrepreneur here in the China market, reading the materials still provided me with a number of valuable insights.  This is a book that needs to be put up on your shelf and one you'll be pulling down again and again to both refer to and lend out to friends.",1291507200,,1126,4.4106280193236715
8561090,5,B0049AD72A,"Micah Truman's helpfully-presented and very digestible 'Bridging the Cultural Divide' is easy but compelling reading if you are to have your wits about you when living or working in China.  Whilst succeeding in different cultures is so much about common courtesy, observation and sensitivity, it is easy unwittingly to give offence.  This package offers you a very readable and well-laid out book and also a DVD version of the material arranged into bite-sized chapters.  Two hours better invested before charging into China are hard to imagine!",1291507200,,545,5.313953488372093
8561091,5,B0049AD72A,"""Micah has distilled his 15 years of Chinese business experience into a concise `how to behave' guide for Western executives traveling to China.  While many others wrap China in mystery and riddles, Micah offers clear-minded and indispensable advice for foreign business people in need of a commonsensical and comprehensive understanding of Chinese business behavior and how they should comport themselves in China.""

8561092,5,B0049AD72A,"Micah Truman's book and accompanying DVD on Chinese business etiquette is a most read for Western businessmen who want to succeed in China.  These materials address what on their face may seem like simple business/social interactions but which in reality  involve complex cultural issues which if handled improperly can easily mean the difference between successfully concluding a deal with your Chinese counterparts and completely wasting your time.

  I first began doing business with China in 1989 and moved here full time in 1998 and I wish that Mr. Tuman's book was available when I first arrived as it would have saved me much time and aggrevation in trying to get deals done early on during my business meetings in China.  Mr. Truman's materials deal with the core business/social interactions which most other business books on China pay scant attention to.  Moreover, the accompanying DVD gives visual examples of what to do and, more importantly, what not to do in various business settings.  The old saying that a picture is worth a thousand words definitely applies here as the DVD clearly and concisely conveys valuable lessons learned by Mr. Truman during his 15 years in China that cannot be totally understood without seeing examples like those contained in the DVD.

  I definitely recommend Mr. Truman's book and accompanying DVD for anyone looking to do business in China.",1290988800,2,1392,5.115044247787611
