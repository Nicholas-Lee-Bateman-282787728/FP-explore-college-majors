7881484,5,6305048991,"I saw this when it originally aired on Nova.  I recorded this later during a replay.  It covers in one hour every major aspect of the title subject.  It truly is a unique stand-alone documentary on an unusual topic, which many people are still not aware.  The only thing that I can say that might be construed as a negative comment is that I wish it had been upgraded by releasing an edition on DVD.  I lost that old recording ,so I orderd this as a replacement/ upgrade.  I really love this rare and unique documentary!",1459036800,,520,4.364583333333333
7881485,5,6305048991,"This NOVA presentation was amazing.  I ordered it after reading:  Warrior Women by Jeannine Davis-Kimball who participated in the creation of the NOVA production.  The photography was wonderful, the ideas shared are totally awe inspiring as I love the ancient world.",1431388800,,266,5.439024390243903
7881486,5,6305048991,This video shatters the Political Correctness myths about who was where first.  This video has information that is censored from the West and even China is in on the censorship act.  It's amazing that this video even was made!  Get it before it goes down the memory hole.,1317859200,,271,4.604166666666667
7881487,5,6305048991,"Western man is essentially a builder and explorer. Which is why he is the 1st one in space and set about circumnavigating the world before that. Its in his nature. This pertains to science too. Unfortunately, in the same breath he's damn good at abandoning said discoveries.

These mummies fit in with this characteristic trait. They wnadered into this region eons ago and maybe even originated there since ""Western"" man seems to have almost an ""Eastern"" origin. He's always going west it would seem. We know he's connected to the Celtic-Germanic peoples and the tapes reveals why. Not just genetic but linguistic and culturally too. Another mystery in the fabric of life. I feel these mummies may be connected to another 1st that can be attributed to ""western"" man which is the nomadic Scythians and Sarmatians who the later Huns and Mongols carbon copied.

These mummies seem to have been very attractive people. This goes against the so-called BS man is progressively getting ""better"". Maybe man is devolving rather than evolving? For ancient people they were very large.

Many legends about huge people in times past. Like the Giants of Bashan, a town in Syria where the people were MASSIVE. Acrhaeological sites and historical records prove they were more than mere legend.

On the video itself it is excellent. It should be on DVD. Funny, how the stupidest, innane garbage seems to be on the cutting edge with availability and truly mind-expanding and educating programs lumber towards the 21st century.

Buy this and learn something new for once instead of rehashed history is bunk slop.

Here is what one person wrote about these mummies:

""One of the most famous of the Tarim Basin mummies is the body of a young woman known as ""The Beauty of Loulan"". Dressed in a felt cap and colourful robes, she has a high cheek-boned face and is clearly Caucasian. Her face is so well-preserved that you can see all of her long eyelashes. She was buried with a beautifully-woven basket of grain besides her, as were many other mummies found in the area.

The most famous male mummy, a bearded blue-eyed man nicknamed ""Ur-David"" by archaeologist Victor Mair of the University of Pennsylvania, looks as if he might sit up at any moment and shake your hand. His skin and soft tissue is virtually intact, even down to the tattoos on his face, and his colourful clothes look as though they could have been woven yesterday.

This mummy is one of several which Mair ""rediscovered"" in 1988 in a room in the Museum of Urumqi. Unfortunately, this museum does not have temperature and humidity controls, so that, ironically, the mummies are now starting to deteriorate. Mair and others are fighting to get the mummies properly preserved, but problems abound, and not merely those of technical know-how or financing. The Xinjiang Ugyur Autonomous Province is a politically sensitive area, and the Chinese authorities do not want the mummies to become a rallying point for the non-Chinese population.""",1167523200,2,2985,4.930278884462151
7881488,5,6305048991,This NOVA program is just fascinating.  It reveals mummies in China that have western and caucasian characteristics!  I didn't even now the ancient Chinese practiced the art of mummification.  It also shows a group of people in China who look like they are 60 percent Caucasoid and 40 percent oriential.  Check it out if you can find it.,1128816000,,337,4.758620689655173
7881489,5,6305048991,"The ""Mysterious Mummies of China"", part of PBS' Nova Series, is a wonderful search into a hitherto unknown and, in the case of the Chinese government, ignored subject: the discovery of non-Chinese mummies in the  Takla Makan desert of Western China.  With fair or red hair and European  features, these mummies threaten the long-standing idea in Chinese history  that China developed without any contact until the Middle Ages.  The  documentary also provides a glimpse into the lack of official effort to  preserve the mummies or excavate for more knowledge of who these people  were.  One telling scene relates how one mummy found by a non-Chinese team  had been beheaded and an Asiatic head put on the body!  The documentary  also shows how the modern people of the region, in the quest for autonomy,  are interested in the mummies to prove their claim that they are not  Chinese in origin.  Cave paintings as well as other archaelogical and  forensic evidence force the viewer -- and hopefully the Chinese government  -- to re-examine who may have shaped Chinese history besides the Chinese  themselves.  Well worth seeing.",962755200,,1126,5.021739130434782
