7838617,5,6303117767,"A little known, little watched movie, but classic Bing Crosby and Betty Hutton.  (By the way, my mom was in the movie as one of the singing WAVEs, so I am a bit biased).",1218153600,,169,3.9705882352941178
7838618,4,6303117767,"Here Come the Waves is a fun little musical comedy typical of classic Hollywood. Betty Hutton stars in two parts as twins Rosemary and Susan, showgirls who decide to do their part for the war and join the Navy. The female branch of the Navy are called the Waves, hence the title. After training, Susan is delighted to find out that her favorite singer, Johnny Cabot (Bing Crosby) is also joining the Navy. She does all she can to track him down and win him over, only she can't help but faint everytime he's around. Rosemary has the opposite problem; she has absolutely no interest in Johnny and yet he pines for her. All three plot and scheme along with Windy (Sonny Tufts) to win each other over, causing quite a few mishaps and many laughs.

Of course, what would a movie with Hutton and Crosby be without music? There are many songs throughout the film done similarly to the way early musicals incorperated song. Either someone is putting on a show or in some cases, someone is romancing another through song. Songs like ""There's A Fella Waiting in Poughkeepsie"" and ""Accentuate the Positive"" are upbeat and fun while ""I'll Promise You"" and ""Let's Take the Long Way Home"" are more dreamlike and sweet.",1176595200,5,1205,4.630841121495327
7838619,5,6303117767,"Split screens and rear projections let singer/comedienne Betty Hutton star -- twice -- in this rousing patriotic film about a pair of twin sisters who join the Navy as WAVEs and in the process find true love.  One sister, Suzie, holds a torch for world-weary pop singer Johnny Cabot (played by Bing Crosby), while her older sister Rosemary, subjected to Suzie's endless moonstruck swooning, finds both the crooner and his fame repellant.  Hutton switch-hits as a ditzy blonde and a responsible redhead, appearing onscreen with herself throughout the film, while Crosby just turns on his natural charm.  Actually, he's one of the few actors who was ever able to upstage Hutton -- Crosby's simply more magnetic than she is, and at times their charismas seem to cancel each other out.  (Hutton doesn't really come alive onscreen until the end of the film, when she get's to cut loose on the cute ""Man In Poughkeepsie"" skit, which shows us what gals would be like if they acted like men  Hutton whips out her ""little red book,"" phones a few fellows up, and lets loose with some great song and dance.)  Co-starring with Crosby is ex-athlete Sonny Tufts, who while he occasionally muffs his lines, is a pretty solid, amiable presence.  The plot creaks a little, but the film provides a great glimpse into WWII popular culture, particularly a concert scene showing the bobbysoxer phenomenon, along with the general ambiance of a nation optimistically at war.  On the downside, the blackface routine for ""Ac-cent-u-ate The Positive"" is disturbing, although the closing number, with several platoons of singing, marching Waves, is brilliantly staged and worthy of comparison to Busby Berkeley's best choreography.  A nice wartime film, and one of Hutton's bigger roles.",1037750400,12,1760,5.062283737024221
7838620,5,6303117767,"As a future naval service member, I enjoy watching movies about the Navy.  I loved this movie and enjoyed seeing a side of the service not normally shown, the WAVES.  This movie was funny, touching, and loveable.  Bing  Crosby is great in this film, and, as always, sings his way into your  hearts.  This film became an instant classic in my home and I'm sure it  will become one in everyone's as well.",944006400,13,402,4.424657534246576
