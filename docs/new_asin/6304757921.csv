925740,5,6304757921,"Bela Lugosi is perfectly eeevil as Dr. Orloff, part-time insurance salesman / full-time con-man and murderer! Orloff has been setting people up w/ fat life insurance policies, only to kill the poor suckers after making himself their sole beneficiary! With the help of his blind, giant henchman, Jake, Orloff has been busily dumping his victims into the Thames! Orloff's utter contempt for the human race is very convincing! Will he be stopped before more people perish?? Scotland Yard is on the case! HUMAN MONSTER is one of Bela's best movies, along w/ WHITE ZOMBIE, DRACULA, THE BLACK CAT, THE RAVEN, and MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. Belongs on every horror shelf...",1133827200,7,666,5.009009009009009
925741,1,6304757921,"""The Human Monster"" is one of my least favourite Bela Lugosi vehicles. It's the story of a string of murders being commited in London, the victims being men without any family and who all have something to do with a life insurance company that is being run by Bela Lugosi. In a dual(?) role, Lugosi also plays the owner of an institution for the blind. Though Lugosi has his charisma (and it's kind of a guilty pleasure to see him goofily play a blind character), the pace is agonizingly slow and I saw the 'surprise' ending coming from a mile away.
The DVD from a bargain bin company called St. Clair Vision claims to be ""carefully remastered for the best possible picture quality."" That's a laugh. The movie looks as fuzzy as one would expect, with scratches and poor contrast. Strangely, this DVD actually has not one but TWO sets of opening credits, the first one with the title ""The Human Monster"" and the second one with the British title ""Dark Eyes of London,"" complete with British censor certificate! These are played back to back. ""Carefully remastered"" indeed. Completists might be interested in having both sets of credits, but that's really the only thing to recommend in the DVD. There are predictably no extras, and the box are is ugly. I got it as part of a ""Classic Horror"" boxed set.",1104278400,7,1301,4.636363636363637
925742,5,6304757921,"what annoys me is a review giving this little known classic horror movie one star due to bad dvd quality.  people are going to see a bad customer rating for this movie, and believe based on the lack of stars that this is a terrible movie, which is just not true.  please, for god sakes, review the MOVIE, not the quality of the release. how stupid some people are!  that's like giving a book a bad review because you didn't like the cover art.  grow up.
now for the movie. this is a wonderful thriller starring bela lugosi.  much of the story is set in a shelter for the blind, and this creates an air of confusion.  lugosi's henchman, a deformed blind giant named jake, is brilliant.  i recall one scene that is a classic moment in horror movie history where bela lugosi, in order to punish one of his minions, deafens a man who is already blind and dumb.  then he binds his arms and legs and throws him in a tub of water.  brilliant.",1075593600,10,935,4.267045454545454
925743,4,6304757921,"I saw this movie late one night on TV about 35 years ago as a child, and some of the images haunt me still!  Lugosi is really quite good here, and the whole thing is set in an eerie, impoverished home for the blind...this creates a dark, disorienting, atmosphere of helplessness. Watch for the trap door that drops victims into the Thames River mud flats! Lugosi's creepy man/beast henchman is the stuff of children's nightmares....
OK, now to address the Alpha DVD quality. No, it's not great. It could be better. But let's face it: as kids we watched these things on grainy black & white TV sets with bent rabbit ear antennas! You could hold your breath for the ""Collector's Edition"", (at a price 4x more) but you're simply not going to see this film anywhere else. The DVD is ridiculously cheap. If you hate it, then donate it to your local library for a tax write-off.",1037750400,9,872,4.518987341772152
925744,1,6304757921,"""The Human Monster,"" a British horror film from 1939 starring Bela Lugosi, is a recent DVD release from Alpha Video.  Its packaging is attractive, featuring artwork from the original release of the film, and its price is essentially pocket change, but sadly the positive qualities of this product stop there.
While I feel inclined to commend the producers of this DVD for trying to market this Lugosi semi-classic, a sixty-plus year old film with limited sales potential, after viewing the DVD I can't help but to regret my purchase and recommend that you don't make my same mistake...even if the cost of the product is minimal.
Technically speaking, even if a film is old there's still little justification for it to look bad or sound bad...and certainly not as bad as this film looks and sounds on this DVD.  The images appear flat and grainy; cinematic shadows ""pulse"" frequently; scratches in the film abound; and one must make a conscious effort to hear the soundtrack in many parts.
Perhaps Alpha Video would argue that this particular movie would never sell enough units to justify the cost of a proper restoration--though this viewpoint would be in conflict with The Roan Group's superbly restored release of ""White Zombie"" and any number of Universal DVD releases featuring Lugosi--but, as it is, this particular DVD release of ""The Human Monster"" fails to satisfy the viewer due to a gross lack of image and audio quality.
The ultimate tragedy here is that, unlike some of Bela's poverty row pictures, most fans of Lugosi and this genre would agree that this is a respectable picture that offers the typecast actor a rare dramatic opportunity...and one he does well with!  It's a shame that such a poor quality print of the movie is used.
Poor Bela fans.",1023667200,19,1764,4.873333333333333
925745,4,6304757921,"Bela Lugosi is certainly one individual you would not want to meet in a dark alley. Come to think of it, a well-lit alley would not be such a great idea either. In this film, he displays his penchant for panic by pretending to be  a doctor whose real prescription is murder! Beware, this film will make you think twice before going to the doctor!",996883200,4,346,4.323076923076923
925746,5,6304757921,"This is Lugosi's best British film, it's an exciting fast paced thriller with Lugosi in top form. In the dual role of the sinister Dr Orloff and the seemingly kind Dr. Dearborn  Lugosi runs an insurance racket in which he drowns blind people and dumps their bodies in the Thames. The film is handsomely mounted, with good production values and a top cast. The film was remade in the 60's with Klaus Kinski in the Orloff role but this is the version you should see.",970444800,2,464,4.458823529411765

The film is obviously dated and produced on a low  budget.  Determined Bela Lugosi fans should be pleased, but others should  beware!",939168000,5,428,5.0

Several bodies are found floating in the Thames, and Scotland Yard is bewildered. Can inspector Holt (Hugh Williams) get to the bottom of this horrible mystery?

925928,4,6304757921,"It was a night full of heavy rain and thunderstorms yesterday. We decided to watch some scary films from 1939 with the lights down low while our dog hid by us from the thunder.  The two movies we chose were available free to Amazon Prime members.  The first one we watched was 'The Face in the Window' (1939).  The second was 'Human Monster' also from that same year.

'The Human Monster' stars Bela Lugosi.  It takes place in England, possibly London. It seems there have been a number of people dying mysteriously, someone is collecting the insurance money on them.  Mr. Lugosi plays a man who has dual careers, he's a doctor and he also sells life insurance...a very suspicious combination. He also does volunteer work as the on-  call doctor for a local home for the blind.  This home includes a large gruesome looking thug who may be a killer.  The home is run by the kindly blind man Prof. John Dearborn.  Also the story has the usual young couple who get caught up in the danger.  Here it's a young investigator who falls for the daughter of one of the victims.  She helps to find her father's killer.  They also throw in a character for comic relief.  He's a policeman from the United States in England to study their investigation methods.  I found this story to be better than the first movie.  It has some very scary moments for the time it was made.  I would say it featured arguably the most evil and cruel character Bela Lugosi ever played.  Previously I would have said his Dracula or his character from 'The Raven' had that devious honor.  This guy makes them look almost tame in comparison.  There are two scenes I found especially disturbing.  I won't go into them here so as not to ruin the film for those who have not seen it.  I can see why this is the first movie in Britain to receive the 'H' (for Horror) certificate.  It has scenes that remind me of the eeriest from Erle C. Kenton's 'Island of Lost Souls' or some of Tod Browning's work from the same decade.  I consider 'The Human Monster' to be a horror classic and well worth seeing for fans of that genre.

Both films together make a good lights out, stormy night, double feature.  I hope some of you will check them out if you've never seen them and you like these sort of films.",1408665600,12,2260,4.411622276029056
925929,5,6304757921,"Based on a story by Edgar Wallace. The wacky premise of Lugosi collecting insurance money by killing people by drowing them in the Thames river is pretty hard to swallow, but a lot of fun. Many of the poverty row movies Lugosi made were pretty thin---I spend a lot of time waiting around until he shows up. But in The Human Monster, there's a pretty good cast that carries their weight. The DVD I have is a pretty bad transfer. The picture is OK, but the sound is dreadful. I downloaded this movie digitally, and it's in much better shape. Not perfect, but watchable.",1398384000,3,567,4.461538461538462
925930,1,6304757921,"I first viewed this film as a youngster in one of our local theaters. Perhaps it was because of my youth that I found the film to be a real ""chiller"".  Of course, in 1940 it was a new release and the quality seemed to be fine as it flashed on the big screen, considering it was made by one of the poverty row studios. Also, having Bela Lugosi in the movie presented some prestige ... although most of Bela's works were made by such back-street companies as Monogram and PRC (Producers Releasing Corp.). His beginning years in Hollywood found him on locations at the higher class Universal Studios, where most of the better horror gems were made during that special era. ""Dracula"" was Bela's shining production, making him a star. Then, he was cast in various ""Frankenstein"" titles.

It is so sad to have Bela's name attached to ""The Human Monster"". I decided to purchase the DVD in order to bring back some of those chilling moments I enjoyed in the early 40s. Within a few seconds after hitting ""play"" on my remote gadget, I realized I had invested in a lousy loser!  The picture quality was blurred to a point of being unwatchable.  Then, there was the terrible ""sound""!  Others viewing what I thought would be a study in my enjoyable yesterdays at the movies asked the same question: ""Can you understand what the cast is saying??""

I immediately hit the ""off"" button on my DVD remote after less than ten-minutes with ""The Human Monster"" A few days later, I shoved the movie into a different player with the same disgusing results.

7877358,5,6304757921,"I'm a huge fan of Bela Lugosi.  So I was happy to add this film to my collection for that reason alone.

The story begins with an epidemic of the drowned.  For the longest time Scotland Yard is baffled by these supposed suicides even though they all had one thing in common, their connection to an insurance agency operated by the positively EVIL Dr. Orloff (Bela Lugosi).  Finally, a suspicious detective, Lieutenant Holt (Hugh Williams), starts to investigate that angle.  When it's learned that the latest victim has tap water in his lungs instead of the muck from the Thames River he was found floating down, and that he had a heretofore unknown daughter, Holt begins to wonder just who benefits from these dead men's insurance policies.  More clues include the dead man's cuff link found in the home of the blind, and a Braille message found on his person.  Could they mean anything?
Short of Dr. Orloff jumping up yelling I did it, I was beginning to worry that the detective was never going to put two and two together!!!

Also notable for the fabulous blind henchmen with an aversion to lights and light bulbs.

A terrific film with a so-so transfer (dubious imagery and sound quality).",1434585600,2,1194,4.701923076923077
