7788422,3,0764003410,"Unlike the other reviewers, I felt that this film was a grade B film with the actor playing Robin Hood not being very athletic and much of the action feeling staged. This is a version of the well-known myth with the usual gang, Friar Tuck, Little John, etc, but with a radically different plot. It includes new characters to fit in the revised version. Robin is a Norman, not a Saxon, and he is accepted by the Saxons as a leader of the gang because he is able to plan. He was adopted by a rich man who had two sons. when about to die the adopting father leaves his estate to the three men. One of them burns the will and kills his brother with Robin's knife and Robin needs to flee to escape being hung for murder. Friar Tuck and Little John are not men Robin meets later, but were employees of his adopted father, as are some others who join Robin. The film is by Hammer Studios, which is famed for its horror films such as Dracula, but there is no horror in this film.",1509926400,,971,4.170212765957447
7788423,4,0764003410,"Just in case you thought Great Britain's Hammer Film Productions only ever put out gothic horror content, the London-based studio was more diverse than that. Hammer actually rolled out a sprawling catalogue of assorted genres ranging from sci-fi to Hitchcockian thrillers to comedies to film noir to even westerns. And in 1967 Hammer dabbled in the swashbuckler with A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD. It's a robust retelling of the legendary outlaw's exploits, only this time, while the Sheriff of Nottingham still skulked around, Robin's archnemesis is his own cousin, the vile Roger de Courtenay (Peter Blythe). Blythe makes his character so slimy and despicable he's just asking to get slapped all the way across the room and then back the other way.

The backdrop will be familiar, with Richard the Lion-Hearted off in the Crusades and his sniveling brother, Prince John, acting as regent. It's still the downtrodden Saxons seething under the heels of their Norman oppressors. When the Norman lord, Robin de Courtenay (Barrie Ingham), is framed for murder by his foul cousin, he flees and seeks shelter in Sherwood Forest only to run afoul of a band of hostile Saxon outlaws. But, as they say, the enemy of my enemy... and also cue that trick where Robin, hood placed over his head, sets loose with unerring aim an arrow to pluck a red ribbon off a bird in mid-flight. What else then but to dub him ""Robin Hood""? It's just one more fashion in which the film trifles with established beats of the Robin Hood lore.

Nothing but nothing can match or rival the pomp and timeless romance and old-fashioned derring-do of Errol Flynn's THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. And Hammer's three stabs at Robin Hood - this and also MEN OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1954) and SWORD OF SHERWOOD FOREST (1960) - don't strive for that breadth of ambition. Budget will not allow it, plus there's only one Errol Flynn. Nevertheless, Hammer puts on a good show. Barrie Ingham is a perfectly serviceable Robin, more down-to-earth than Flynn's version, less prone to striking those dramatic poses. I love Errol Flynn's take, but I also commend Ingham's vigorous lunchpail interpretation. And, man, I wish I had Ingham's commanding voice. With a voice like his, one could storm castles all the live long day.

Ain't nuthin' fancy to this swashbuckler. But there are moments, exciting and droll, to make you take in the movie with some appreciation. As a nod to tradition, Robin and his merrie men combat tyranny with brawny humor and carefree robbery, except in this movie they also fight with delicious airborne pies. Note that, in John Arnatt's hands, the Sheriff of Nottingham becomes a sly adversary, more crafty and more dangerous than the impulsive Cousin Roger. And just maybe you'll see thru the film's deception about Maid Marian (a fetching Gay Hamilton). Abetted by dialogue that has some snap to it and humor, A CHALLENGE FOR ROBIN HOOD delivers a succession of nostalgic matinee thrills and is a lively and accessible entry in the increasingly bloated landscape of Robin Hood cinema.

By the way, if you end up buying this product, be aware of the format. You may end up with a Region 2 DVD or a VHS tape.",1446336000,2,3179,4.848987108655617

7788425,5,0764003410,"Unaware of this version of Robin Hood until reading about it in Jeffrey Richards' ""Swordsmen of the Screen"", I found ""A Challenge for Robin Hood"" a most pleasant surprise.  The film is a charming, exciting, and largely original (Robin is a Norman, not a Saxon!) take on the legend, with engaging performances by all.  Barrie Ingham is a fine Robin, and James Arnatt makes a truly despicable Sheriff of Nottingham, to mention just the two.  The hairstyles are very much 1960s, but the costumes and atmosphere are suitably medieval -- yet the Middle Ages of lore and song, rather than the largely miserable reality of history.

There's a lovely scene I'm especially fond of where Robin and Marian and the band are gathered around the fire in their camp one evening, singing a ballad.  Various members of the band -- and finally Robin -- offer the verses, and everyone joins in the chorus.  The song is a moving, melancholy, modal tune with words that serve to summarize the political situation -- it's really a wonderful scene.

It's good that a widescreen VHS release is available, but a pity that the film isn't on DVD in the United States.  The PAL DVD has fine picture and sound, but not noticeably superior to the VHS copy.  The PAL DVD I purchased from Amazon (from Studio Canal / Optimum Classic) does not have irremovable Spanish subtitles, as one reviewer's PAL DVD has, but has optional subtitling in a number of languages.  The running time is 92 minutes, while my VHS copy has a running time of 96 minutes.

This lovely film -- one of the last of the true swashbucklers -- is recommended for swashbuckler aficionados, and lovers of the Robin Hood legend who are more concerned with capturing the spirit of the ballads rather than the plots themselves.",1297382400,7,1761,4.722222222222222
