8215358,5,B000UWXM1C,"I ran across this great buy while searching for a old Alan Ladd flick. ""The Blue Dahlia"", and found this instead. What a find! If you are a Film Noir buff like myself, this is a must buy. All movies are excellent copies, except, ""The Big Steal"" (because they colorized it), DUMB! Otherwise a great deal for less than $20. Warning, make sure you have a region free dvd player as this boxed set is for region 2.",1344988800,3,409,4.256410256410256
