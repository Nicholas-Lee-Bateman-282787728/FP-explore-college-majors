7444041,3,B015N8JH84,"Nine Things About the Movie ""The Green Inferno""

1. Horror director Eli Roth made this movie as a tribute to the cannibal genre of Italian horror films of the late 1970's and early 1980's.

2. By making this movie rated R, the movie gave up the ability to really go for the guts (so to speak), so it's weak sauce compared to the grindhouse classics that inspired it, like ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""Cannibal Ferox"" (those two films didn't even bother getting a rating, so their violently cruel scenes are still infamous and remarkable, even 40 years later).

3. This movie is about a group of annoying, over-privileged college students who take a trip to Peru to protest the destruction of the Amazon rainforest and the natives that live there. The plane crashes, and the students meet some natives that torture and eat them, I guess because Amazon natives hate all white people.

4. It seems like Roth knew that making a full-on cannibalistic massacre of white people would not be successful, so he tried to justify the violence by stapling it to the end of a different movie about saving the rainforest. This way, Roth is apparently trying to use the movie to make a satirical statement about social activism or the inescapable cruelty of the modern world. But all the activists are clueless morons manipulated by cynical masterminds, so the message is muddled, and none of it matters anyway once the cannibals show up.

5. The violence is fairly extreme for an American horror movie, but there's really not that much of it; the cannibals don't meet the students until the movie is half over. The movie is not scary at all. It's actually part comedy, in that Eli Roth way. This isn't always a good thing - the stoned cannibal scene is kind of gruesomely humorous, but it also completely takes away any sense of menace or dread the movie had built up.

6. There are some memorable lines in the movie, like ""I can smell them cooking my friend!"" and ""It's good they ate Josh first. He should last them almost a week.""

7. The script is not very smooth, and the movie seems like it had story lines cut out of it - there are scenes and characters that feel like they were supposed to be part of something bigger. That's the only explanation I have for the diarrhea scene.

8. The end of the movie doesn't make any sense except to set things up for a sequel. Or else it was Roth's way to deny charges that the movie is racist (I'll let you decide for yourself whether the movie is actually, or intentionally, racist).

9. This is dumb, gory fun, and if you didn't know that cannibal movies used to be a thing, you may be impressed. But it's also kind of boring. And if you're a fan of the original genre, this movie will be pretty tame. It might make you miss the old days when filmmakers didn't care about political correctness or getting the highest box office.",1443225600,3,2858,4.533980582524272
7444042,2,B015N8JH84,"After a long protracted wait, The Green Inferno finally hit theaters and I ran out to catch it on its first day. As a fan of the cannibal film sub-genre, I have to say this was pretty disappointing on many levels. This is more or less just a variation of Hostel set in the jungle. It still squarely falls in the boundries of this past decades torture porn genre without any of the actual exploitation trappings of the cannibal films of the 1970s to early eighties. Why is this? It is certainly more gorey (realistically so) than either of Deodato's cannibal juggernauts, ""Jungle Holocaust"" or ""Cannibal Holocaust,""  yet the movie fails to even deliver the grotesquerie of Eli's own Hostel II.

Could it be that the film is undermined by it's glossy production value - making it seem that the jungle is somehow actually a set? Never does it feel claustrophobic, sweaty or humid. It is shot in a flat, brightly lit way that makes it seem like a standard studio horror movie and lacks any of the grittiness or grime of those famous cannibal pictures from 4 decades ago. Is the brutality of the film completely undermined by the lack of nudity of the white victims in the film. It's jarring - nude tribes, dismemberments, ragged-red dyed natives, yet our white female charcters shall be left with the dignity of their bras and panties. It's a pale comparison to the visceral nature of the old films. Throughout, it is demonstrated that the ONLY place Roth is willing to go is straight up effects gore, but it is still nothing we all haven't seen before. Why doesn't the film actually have the conviction to perform female castration on the main heroine? Why not dispatch all the characters in as horrific and blood curdling ways as the first main victim?Why, in one of the most poorly written, disappointing and narratively frustrating aspects of the film *SPOILER* does the obnoxious, ""villian"" activist NOT get his comeuppance at the end of the movie?  Time and again, looking back, you realize Roth didn't treat his characters as viciously as what they actually deserve or make them even more repugnant than he could have. Which is a shame, because he takes time to set up the satirical elements of sheltered, left-leaning, entitled college students - but refuses to actually portray them as the douchebags they are!

Surprisingly - much older movies, such as Kingdom of the Spiders or the Swarm from the 70s provide more thrills by their unquestionable dedication to actually covering their actors with REAL tarantulas, REAL bees. I have never been so laughably taken out of a film so quick than in Green Inferno's ""Ant Torture"" sequence. CGI ants do not make for cinematic nightmares. I could even go back to a MUCH older film - 1965's Naked Prey - for a film that delivers more taut feelings of actual jeopardy.

Cannibal Holocaust's reputation and notoriety continue to grow - not only for it's controversial animal killings, but for it's general pure visceralness, claustrophobia, verisimilitude and film score. In fact Cannibal Holocaust's music score is rightly one of the more queesily effective score in the horror cannon. If Roth knows these movies, than why did I not notice ONE music cue fom the Green Inferno?

What you will get when you see Green Inferno? The standard horror outing of dead college students with a few spalshes of gratuitous gore, without the novelty, faux realism, exploitation or blunt brutality of the original cycle of cannibal films. I recall now a scene from Jungle Holocaust: Ivan Rassimov (performing his own, presumably very dangerous stunt) tied with vines, a bird tethered to his ankle, being hoisted and dropped repeatedly from the top of an enormous cave, while throngs of natives ritualisticly chant below. You will find NOTHING as strange, nightmarish or realistic as this in Green Inferno, and not an eye or tongue had to be cut out to make you feel digusted.",1443139200,5,3905,4.838323353293413

You join a group of college buddies on a protest mission to Central America to prevent the destruction of the jungle of indigenous people by corporate America.  It's just a statement...not a militant mission.  What could possibly go wrong?  It becomes everyone's worst nightmare.  Definitely not for the queasy, this nail-biting, skin-crawling, and stomach-churning flick is exhausting!  Just when you think nothing worse could happen it does.  Even Stephen King loved it and maybe that's why I fastened my seat belt a little tighter and went for the ride until the finish.  Stephen said, and I quote, ""A glorious throwback to the drive-in movies of my youth: bloody, gripping, but you can't look away.""  Remember...this is not for the squeamish.

7444071,2,B015N8JH84,"First things first: go ahead and skip the first 40 minutes of this, and know that everybody except Justine is a terrible person and their deaths are earned. Second: just skip the whole damned thing and watch either Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox instead. If you must watch an Eli Roth film, watch Hostel or Cabin Fever. If you've already seen all of those, watch them again. Most deaths happen offscreen, and as for what is shown: I've seen better effects on movies that cost a few thousand bucks to make and are sold at the vendor tables at indie fests. There's a really shitty cgi scene, and surprisingly little gore considering it's an Eli Roth film about cannibals. I'm very disappointed with this movie.",1519344000,,714,4.72
7444072,5,B015N8JH84,"Today is Ms Antonieta Pari's Birthday (May 31), and it's night over here. To honor her I watched the movie that I knew her from, Eli Roth's The Green Inferno. This movie is a tribute to classic cannibal films from the 70s and 80s, a homage to ""Cannibal Holocaust."" Antonieta plays a leader of a cannibal tribe, and her performance is terrifying and frightening, with her looks. She's just incredibly fearsome and amazing. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of her films. Lorenza Izzo, who is Eli's wife, was the leading actress and did an outstanding job. The rest of the cast and crew was also awesome. It has that disturbing bloody gore, with scenes that will make you go WTF. It also has comedy, with a mixture of the bizarre that is guaranteed to shock viewers. I have seen lots of bad reviews for this movie and I just don't understand why. Some people says it's gory and some says it's not gory enough. Everyone has their opinions, but for me everything was perfect and it's in its order. Eli Roth really worked hard for this feature. It's not easy making a movie like this. He trained real life villagers who had no experience in acting. Lorenza risked her life in a scene where she nearly drowns. They busted their asses for the movie, and some people just don't give them credit. I truly respect and love them 100% for this bloody, dark, good, intense, adventurous fun ride. One of the reasons I loved it is that there is no animal cruelty in it, and I salute Eli Roth for that. Eli and Lorenza prove that they are one of the best duos in the Horror World. Whether you love it or hate it, this is one of those films people will be talking about for ages. Back in 2013, my Dad was so thrilled when he heard that Eli was doing a cannibal film. He was a huge fan of Eli's films. The sad part is he passed away in June. Fast forward to 2015, and it was released in my country on September 24, my Dad's Birthday. I was like, Dad, I am gonna celebrate your Birthday by watching the movie you waited for. I watched it on the big screen and it was heavily censored, but I still enjoyed it. In January 2016 I finally got to watch it uncut for the first time on iTunes. Later I got it on DVD, and this is a movie that every horror fan out there should own. And I'm so excited that there's a sequel in the works titled ""Beyond The Green Inferno,"" and I truly hope Antonieta Pari reprises her role as the Queen Of The Cannibal Clan!!!",1517961600,2,2438,4.279220779220779

 I spent the entirety of the film trying to follow a horribly sewn together script, where characters make decisions that have you questioning the competency of the writer. If Mr Roth truly dwelt with us in reality, he might've graced us with a cohesive script that could've been thrilling, intuitive and though-provoking. Instead one needs to endure moronic characters, terrible stereotypes and an unwatchable dung pile that lacks any real innovation or uniqueness.
 The cinematography is atrocious from the first to last frame, as if the creators were trying to bombard its audience with poorly constructed scenes, well below par CGI and, a hodge-podge of randomly added scenes that were completely nonsensical.
 I really hope that you would move along and save your money because, there is truly nothing to see here.",1515369600,3,1044,5.023121387283237

Id definitely recommend fans of 70s/80s exploitation movies check out The Green Inferno. I rewatched both Cannibal Holocaust and Cannibal Ferox recently, and this felt like a good companion film to those. It had some great gore effects, beautiful locations, and cheesy characters.

7444090,2,B015N8JH84,"I used to think Eli Roth had at least a few good movies in him. I mean, he worships all the right directors and is inspired by all the great exploitation films, yet he seems to completely miss the point when it comes to honoring these films in his movies. Of all the subversive sub-genres, the cannibal flick is by far the most notorious and derided. Even many horror fans find the original Italian cannibal films to be sickening and unwatchable in their depiction of cruelty to both animals and humans. Roth should be given credit for trying to resurrect a genre no one was asking for, but he seems to have missed the point. I have two main issues with this film and in explaining them, I will have to REVEAL SOME SPOILERS, so if you want to avoid this, please stop reading. Anyone who has seen Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox knows the savages in those films are actually the so-called civilized intruders who agitate and provoke the indigenous tribes to the point of justified revenge. Sure, we have a few scumbags in The Green Inferno, but they aren't torturing and raping the locals to the extent of getting what they deserve. Most of the lead characters are there for admirable reasons and undeserving of their fate which clearly is contradictory to what was a social commentary on the feigned civility of a modern, civilized world. In the context of this film, we are simply watching jungle savages eat torture and people. Another issue is the fact that these films should be totally unconventional. Watching them should keep you on edge that any character at any time can meet their grizzly fate. Italian filmmakers didn't always believe the cute girl or hunky guy would live to see another day at the end. Here, it's completely apparent who our heroine is and you never really feel the danger of her not being the sole survivor. How ballsy would it have been to kill her off midway through and continue on with the other characters? That's something that would have made Deodato proud. Without any unexpected twists, this is simply an uninspired imitation of the films before it.",1503964800,,2093,4.690217391304348

Fortunately, and not surprisingly, any scenes of real-life animal torture are missing Roth has also managed to elevate the subgenre with an unsubtle but well-relayed message that points a finger at us entitled western douches.

Activists out to save the tribes in the Amazon end up getting eaten and tortured by the same people they were out to save. It was a great cast, good story, and followed the script of the cannibal chow downs of yesteryear but something was missing.  I saw KNB effects and thought, this is going to be great. Greg Nicottero and Howard Berger can do no wrong in the world of special effects makeup!

This is the Directors Cut,  however it was rated R so what gives?  Why was it not the Unrated Directors cut?  So many scenes seemed cropped to allow for minimum on screen gore!  I know KNB put more effects out there then we got to see.  Either I am totally desensitized or lots of footage was left on the cutting room floor.

So, the plot goes that some students go into the jungle to ""save"" it from being demolished, and thereby no longer being a home to the cannibals that live there.  Okay.  And all seems well and good until their plane crashes and the cannibals find them.  Cue up the blood!  I LOVE horror!  Preferably a slasher flick but any horror will do, really.  This was SO over the top, though.  *SPOILERS*  People getting their limbs chopped off and their eyeballs cut out, then the cannibals eating them ... poor girls and guys stuck in a cage and one of them having to crap herself in front of the others.  At one point, they shove pot down a dead girls throat so that when the cannibals cook her, they will be ""out of it"" and the students, themselves, can escape.  But what they don't realize is ... the cannibals get the munchies.  And what do you think happens next??? OH!

7444251,2,B015N8JH84,"Spoilers...

The first wave of the cannibal genre had a consistent set of conventions, and they seemed to be missing here.  I actually though the acting was decent if not better than decent, the cast of natives were all great, and the visuals were there, but the staples of a good cannibal movie were mainly absent strangely enough.  I like the idea of a revival of the sub-genre of cannibal films, and I understand the limitations based on the sheer madness of what some of the original films captured which cannot be emulated, but this was not it.  This is a completely subjective list, but here is what I loved about the progenitors of the cannibal genre which this film was clearly an homage to, but did not quite capture, in no particular order.

1. Gore!  Green Inferno had Greg Nicotero in the arsenal, but aside of a few chopped limbs there was nothing memorable!!  Man From Deep River and Jungle Holocaust managed to pull off more impressive gore with bare-bones prosthetics 40ish years ago, so the glaring lack of gore in Green Inferno is unforgivable.  As a cornerstone of the exploitation sub-genre, a cannibal film without gore is just lacking or missing the mark.

2. Abundant/gratuitous/unnecessary but welcome nudity.  Nope.  Momentary instances toward the end, but even the natives were as modest as the Amish.  Nope.  I do not consider this a necessity for the vast majority of films, but this is an homage to the cannibal niche, and to honor a very specific tangent of a cinematic style by constricting it at the core principals is unacceptable.  Nope.

3. The soundtrack.  Riz Ortilani's soundtrack to Cannibal Holocaust is nothing short of beautiful, but catchy synth music was the staple of most others.  The soundtrack to this film did not even register, I had to look it up after-the-fact to even remember what it was like.

4. Social commentary.  Attempted but not realized.  Nearly all past examples either staged several unlikable folks in scenarios they deserved or placed do-gooders in harm's way.  The approach of a main character fueled by good intentions among a group of notoriety seekers was great, but in the end the cannibals were slightly too caricatured to be wholly good or bad and everything came off as a bit muddled.

5. The convert and the symbol.  Essentially ever cannibal film either had an outside-the-box thinking cannibal who helped the protagonist or a character that was a purre symbol of the film's base message.  Cannibal Holocaust had Robert Kerman who condemned the students despite being an objective anthropologist, Lorraine De Selle in Cannibal Ferox embodied objective curiosity, Ivan Rassimov was the survivor, and Mei Mei Lai was awesome in everything.  The main character in Green Inferno may have stood for well-meaning naivety, but suddenly championing one side in the end just seemed odd.  The young helper, who was given the whistle necklace, was an interesting character but did not add much.

The stand-out cannibal characters seemed to be borrowed as well, the leader was basically a carbon copy of the female Berzerker in The 13th warrior and the stand-out male was a rehashed character from Apolalypto.  It is like NASA reminding us that we made it to the moon a few decades ago, but unveiling that their next feat is driving all of the way to Louisana.  A step backward.  I miss the 80's.",1473724800,,3360,4.86443661971831

The kids are idiots that are always protesting for stupid crap like save the tse tse fly; you see very quickly how they realize that life isn't always a trendy, sexy reality show. The violence is exceptional to the point that I wanted to get some ketchup for my popcorn and if you like Andrew Zimmern and his eating brains and bug eyes, this should delight you.

The movie was horrific and frightening with a little bit of humor. There was nothing excessive in it like in some of his other movies, such as blood for the sake of blood or torture for the sake of shock value. The movie was well balanced, realistic and terrifying to the end.

Like most modern horror movies today, The Green Inferno didn't have any cheap jump scares or anything paranormal lurking in the background making silly faces that are meant to be scary. Instead, it's smart, brutal and leaves you thinking about the ending and the choice the heroine makes. I can easily call this movie a modern horror classic, and I hope Eli Roth continues down this road making original, horror films of this caliber.",1469404800,2,858,4.535483870967742

7444480,3,B015N8JH84,"As a fan of Eli Roth's earlier work, and being well aware of his celebrated affinity for 70's-'80's Italian-made cannibal gore-fests, I had high expectations that this movie would be completely over-the-top. It wasn't. Sure, there's a decent helping of graphic, violent scenes full of blood-and-guts at first, but then the movie just stalls. It takes nearly half of the movie before the cast is even captured by the cannibals! The expectation from Roth is that the character deaths tend to become more elaborate and gruesome as the movie progresses, but it just doesn't happen here. There's just an uneven quality to the final edit that ultimately ruins the flow of  movie. The BD extras are also sparse and a disappointment: a boring view-once-and-forget production photo gallery and a cast/crew commentary by Roth, his wife Izzo and selected cast/crew. The commentary is a disjointed mess that runs the gamut from jungle heat-induced cast maladies, to how ""cute"" the various cannibal extras were, through all the gruesome scenes filmed but edited-out of the final cut for dramatic effect and/or artistic license. Roth reasons that the suggestion of violence versus all-out graphic gore is subtler, classier, and ultimately conveys the essence of the intended meaning without actually going there. That minimalist approach may work for more artsy and/or serious fare, but not for a Roth horror flick. An extended alternate cut would have been welcome. They could have at least included the deleted scenes as extras, but didn't.

Bottom Line: Unless you're a Roth completist, I'd skip the expense of the Bluray release and rent/stream it instead.",1458259200,,1646,5.2075471698113205

But this movie does give you a different feeling towards the munchies and cannibals.

The biggest problem with this movie is the general structure of the film since the beginning to entirely useless, and gives nothing to the big first act turn.  mostly cause the main guy is a complete ass and when its a revealed that he is, its like 'well yeah.'  also, the film is soft, I know a lot of people have said that, but i've seen horror movies in recent history that aren't, but don't kill random animals for shock value.  Horror movies in the amazon can be messed up in other ways.

Yes, it was way overboard meal preparation and surprisingly realistic body snacks (in most cheap slasher/slice/dice films the prosthetics look artificial). Filming and acting were better than expected and sold me. Part of the reason the acting was somewhat capturing was the reality of a tropical Peruvian forest and the gusto in which the novice tribal people took to their roles.
End result is nobody (including the eco provocateurs, tribes peoples, deforesters) came away smelling like roses, in fact, I would not have been displeased if, in the end, they were all munched upon by the resident leopard, vanquisher of evil.
A couple of picky points that lowered the rating. First, every tribal member (no matter the age) was totally painted in red clay like pigment - all the time; not realistic given the humid conditions and time they would have needed to apply said substance. Second, all the women (and young girls) wore tops to cover their breasts which as we all know about tropical tribes - that just doesn't happen. Third, why would the village attack the construction armed mercenaries in a clearing given their stealth in a forest. Fourth, a lot of gaps foremost was Samantha's escape then we hear nothing more. Supposedly we are suppose to pay attention to tattoos.
Suggestion: Watch again, afterwards, with cast commentary as it's more interesting than the film.",1456704000,,1474,4.923694779116466

Now this is from Eli Roth (Hostel) who as a film maker tends towards the slash and gore type of experiences  and this is no exception.  The violence is quiet graphic and I actually wasn't expecting it. The Amazon tribe are all played by real natives and that gives this a real sense of reality. Some of the plot is a bit far fetched and some of the acting was just about ok.

The thing is I am still split a bit like some of the protagonists  ooops over whether I really like this or not.

This film is truly horrifying as it portrays the inner workings of an isolated cannibal tribe through the eyes of their naive Western social justice warrior captives. The film's use of female circumcision as a vehicle for terror invites comparisons of Western values to Islam, making the film a timely commentary of Europe's invasion at the hands of Muslim rape gangs and Western feminism's blatantly hypocritical response. If you just want a scary movie, The Green Inferno definitely gets the job done. The acting, dialogue, and visuals are all top notch, and the plot zips along quickly.

7444631,4,B015N8JH84,"Portions of this film make ""Hostel"" look like ""The Sound of Music.""
Eli wanted to push the envelope & recapture the ""essence"" of those 70's cannibal
films, and of course, he succeeded and then some.

In the beginning of the film, when the students are in class watching a documentary
on tribal female genital mutilation, i thought to myself: Oh, Dear God....please, don't
let this be foreshadowing of what's to come....""

Regardless, the story is pretty interesting, though i did find it hard to believe that the main
character would decide to jump on a plane to the Amazon, after deciding to be an activist
over night.
Talk about impulsive!

But it leads to some great scenes & set-ups, including a fantastic sequence involving
a small plane crash (There's some gore & Eli-esque humor during this portion of the action).

From there, the real depravity begins.
Let's just say, the lucky one's perished in the aforementioned crash.

If you can get past that first ritualistic/slaughter cannibal scene, which has to be one of the
most agonizingly gruesome deaths i've ever sat through in thirty five years of horror viewing,
then you're good to go for the rest of the ride.

There is a light hearted sequence, where the tribe actually ends up stoned, which i thought
was funny & clever, though it soon escalates to a case of the ""munchies"", and well...
You can guess what happens from there.

But, overall, one of the better cannibal flicks out there.
Take it as an homage to those films of yesteryear with your expectations in check,
and you'll appreciate Inferno.",1455235200,,1564,4.813432835820896

I had seen Cannibal Holocaust which Eli loved and so I was expecting that movie and man am I glad thats what I did not get. First off this movie is visually beautiful, the lush greenery, the mountains and the water, the skyline just magnificent. As the movie starts you begin to see just as beautiful as it is it is just that dangerous and scary. The natives were top notch mystifying and scary..blood thirsty if you will.  The plane crash looked so good and was done so well.  The camp ground where the natives were, the rituals, the scalping was done so well.

I cannot tell you how good this was. First off it was edge of your seat, it was gory at times and scary maybe even a little sad. The executions were great, the backdrop of the country made you feel like there was no way out. Just a great ride of a movie and the ending was also well done. From the nightmare to the sister calling... just awesome.

The whole subject of cannibalism is so taboo, and rarely used in decent horror movies, but Eli Roth totally rocked it, the right way.  What I mean by that is that there is a good story to it and the actual really gory stuff only occupies about half the movie.  In my opinion, Eli Roth is one of the best in the present day, when I see his name attached to movies, I generally check them out.  Yes, there are a few recent ones, i.e. ""The Stranger"", that made me fall asleep before it was over, but overall he pretty much rocks!  On a side note, Lorenza Izzo, his wife who is in a lot of his latest stuff, is just so drop dead gorgeous, no matter what scene/makeup she's in.  So, even if you aren't a fan of this movie, at least she is in pretty much all of it, so you have a reason to watch! Oh yea, shes also a pretty good actress!",1454976000,4,984,4.046391752577319

There are moments that approach the intensity of those older films, but ""Green Inferno"" almost always pulls back at the last moment. While in this day and age of PG-13 horror, ""Green Inferno"" can be seen as pushing the envelope, genre fans understand that this films fails in delivering the horror and chills that the films which inspired it achieved.

A group of activists fly down to the rain forest in order to stop a natural gas company from bulldozing a native village. When the students' plane crashes, the survivors find themselves captured, and on the menu of the local cannibal clan.

I mean dear god all he was doing was basically a remake of Cannibal Holocaust. The story was there already. Just needed to make some tweaks and update the story a bit, but no, not Roth. This egotistical, arrogant person decides it would be a good idea to open his mind and reinvision a classic. So what do we get? A cheesy, super corny, horrible acted, uninteresting story by one of the worst directors/writers in cinema history. How does this guy keep being given the funds and chances to make movies? We read about this movie for over a year before it was finally released. We were told it would make Cannibal Holocaust look like Sesame Street. We were told it was too gory and horrifying to be released and that's why it was delayed for so long. We were told that it was too extreme for American audiences. Even the production company funding it was so terrified that it wanted the movie shelved so it wouldn't scar the American moviegoer. Well its eventual release told us the true story. This movie isn't worth the cost of the disc its put on. The production company watched this movie and realized what a horrible waste of money they handed to Roth. They didn't wanna lose another cent and didn't want to release this movie for that very reason. Roth battled them and eventually won due to the contract they made with him. They did a quick limited release in theaters to suffice the contract and then put it quickly to disc, hoping people would snatch up the copies from the false internet created hype before word got around just how bad of a movie this is. I just don't have it in me to address the actual details of this joke of a story, but I can say you have been warned. If you insist on seeing it for yourself just to make your own decision then PLEASE be smart like I was and just throw out a $1.50 at redbox.

7444782,4,B015N8JH84,"Four Star rating; Five Star review!  Loved it! A very under-rated suspense movie.  There is nothing in this film that could not happened or hasn't happened.  The plot, although a familiar cinematic pattern, is nonetheless topical and realistic and exposes the naivete of the hopelessly idealistic social/environmental reformer who doesn't or cannot acknowledge the inherent human propensity for evil, deceit and corruption.  If this is the lesson learned, then the insight only benefits a sole surviving member of the sheltered and protected  ""we can make a difference"" American private university student (Columbia?) who is burdened by the guilt of her privileged economic/social status (her father is a UN attorney) and her driven humanistic impulse to ""save the rain forests""--a displaced, sexual transference ala Freud.
  And that of course is why I have to rate this otherwise engaging, even mesmerizing film a four: the plot--the arrangement and interaction of events and characters--relies heavily on the predictable horror movie formula that I refer to as ""cutting and culling.""  We sense from the opening minutes of the film who the hero(ine) will be, and who will be expendable, but this doesn't distract from the suspense and predicted revealing of events.

I loved every minute of this film.  The Cannibalistic community--the real ""sane"" element in the movie as it is naturally opposed to mindless, corporate exploitation--is so realistically and exotically presented that our ""suspension of disbelief"" is never an issue (is there a sequel here?) and I sincerely applaud everyone involved in creating this segment (contribution, apparently, of some really fine Chilean cinematic artists).  I especially ""enjoyed"" the scene of the ""head-chef"" cannibal preparing a classic braised ""leg of human,"" lovingly rubbing this cherished ""cut"" with aromatic oils and choice rain-forest seasonings for the evening feast.

Won't reveal the ending but it certainly arrives with its own dose of ambiguity and irony, and we heartily cheer for our heroine's more realistic redemption (trial by fire--no pun intended): she will, we are now convinced after her experience in the primitive Peruvian rain-forest, temper her idealism and go on to effect real environmental/social change.

7444953,3,B015N8JH84,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

So maybe not so much of a surprise for fans of Eli Roth but Ive never included myself among that group. Im not one of those that have piled hate upon the writer/director as some have but Ive also not been one to sing praises for him as well. I thought CABIN FEVER felt like the middle of a movie rather than one with an end. I found both HOSTEL films to be tasteless and self-serving to gore hounds and not horror or mystery fans. And honestly with the exception of those two films what else has Roth been known for?

He is definitely a fan of movies and I love that about him. His enthusiasm for making movies is also infectious. Because of these things Ive never been one of those people that have wished him ill will or for his films to fail before they were released. So when I sat down to watch THE GREEN INFERNO, knowing not just what I felt about Roths movies but all of the controversy surrounding the subject matter and release of the film I didn't expect much. What I got was a pleasant surprise.

Lets start off by making it clear that Roth is not just a movie fan but a lover of the classic exploitation films of the past. One of the genres that he loved and talks about were the cannibal movies that came out in a burst some years ago. Movies like CANNIBAL FEROX and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST are must see movies for horror fans and films that have driven people into the lobby of many a theater in search of something to heave into. When you see some of the things that have happened in these films you have to wonder going in just what Roth could add to that.

The film opens with a young college student named Justine (Lorenza Izzo) waking up to the sound of a small protest group on campus on a Sunday morning. As she walks outside later she catches the eye of the leader of the group, Alejandro (Ariel Levy). Attracted but knowing hes spoken for she moves on.

Justine ends up having dinner with her father, a career diplomat for the U.S. and they have the standard idealistic young person versus cynic world traveled father. They part on good terms though with Justine letting him know that shes joined the group of peaceful activists and hopes to go with them on a class trip to South America. In reality the plan is to disrupt a tree harvesting group thats tearing down the rain forest and forcing out primitive tribes in the area.

The group arrives and instructions are given. The group plans to live stream their activities online as they happen. As they chain themselves to the trees to prevent them from being torn down, Justines lock doesnt work. It is then that she realizes that shes been used. Armed mercenaries rain down on the group and Alejandro lets them know who Justine is or better yet who her father is. Rather than be shot the mercs unchain the group and send them packing back home.

But on the way the plane they are in has trouble and crash lands. Some members of the group are instantly killed, some injured and others battered but fine. As they try to find a way to communicate their whereabouts and get help, a red painted tribe approaches them. These were the people they came to save. Too bad this is the same group that captures them and takes them to their village. Not only that but before long they find out the intentions of this tribe. The noble minded students are soon to be dinner for their captors as is almost always the case in films of this genre.

The rest of the movie moves back and forth between attempts by various members of this group to escape and their being fileted or tortured by the tribe. While the visuals are gut wrenching, figuratively and actually, there is a certain amount of humor to be found in the predicament of the bleeding heart (no pun intended) students who came to save this group now being devoured by them.
Aside from the gore the movie is an amazingly beautiful film in both color and content when it comes to the jungle scenes on display. The contrast by the lush green locations up against the red painted natives is eye popping. While watching the film I was stunned by each shots capture of the beauty of the land where it takes place. It made the violence feel out of place and yet appropriate at the same time. More than any film hes done so far, this movie showed that Roth does indeed have a directors eye.

The mystery of the film, whether or not any of these student activists will survive, plays on you from the moment they are caught until the end of the film. Their idealism is to be cheered but their activities questioned. And just which ones are the savages is left to the viewer to decide once the end credits roll.

I may have to change my opinion of Eli Roth as a director. This makes the second film hes been involved with (the other as actor/producer) that Ive enjoyed now. Hopefully he will make more films as the years progress and will make them more along the lines of this one than those in the past. I wish he would branch out into other genres where the gore isn't the focus of what it going on, perhaps a western. He has the talent and this film shows that. It would be nice to see him use it for more than just blood and guts. As for this movie, if you aren't disturbed by extreme gore, then its definitely worth watching.",1453334400,2,5292,4.341759352881699

Right up until the lead protagonist leaves the jungle, it isn't bad, but the very ending, after the return to civilization (?), it is simply ludicrous.  Three (count 'em) three bad add on endings, all of which are not only unnecessary, but just plain bad.  Why spoil a decent thriller with that?  I don't know.
And when I say decent, I don't mean good.  It was uneven at best.  But it had it's moments.  The worst part (aside from the ending) was the ridiculous portrayal of the group, and especially the leader, of those who were joined to stop the destruction of the rain forest and the slaughter of natives.  These things happen, and have been happening for decades, but this movie doesn't show it realistically or sensibly.

7445001,4,B015N8JH84,"I have long been a fan of Eli Roth. I really enjoyed Cabin Fever. I absolutely loved Hostel... and I liked Hostel Part II as well (granted, not as much as Part I)... also, his fake trailer for Thanksgiving, from the movie Grindhouse, was by far my favorite. He is a filmmaker that I find myself always looking forward to what he is doing next... and when I heard the name of his upcoming film was ""The Green Inferno"" I got super excited... because everyone who is an Eli Roth fan knows his favorite film is Cannibal Holocaust... and everyone who knows Cannibal Holocaust knows that the film within a film ""documentary"" in Cannibal Holocaust is called... The Green Inferno.

I was of the mindset that if anyone can homage Cannibal Holocaust right... it's Eli Roth... and I was right..... for the most part. Once Eli gets his cast to the jungle is where the film really takes off. Unfortunately, we spend about 30 minutes or so in the city getting to know characters that don't really register to us... or we just plain don't care about... Only Lorenza Izzo comes across as someone who isn't just a ""type"".... but then we get to the jungle and it doesn't matter... even though we don't necessarily give a crap about most of the characters we don't really want to see them munched on by cannibals....

...and once the cannibals enter the picture, the film is very nerve racking... there is the feeling of dread that comes over you of what's going to happen next...

That being said... Eli Roth made a good cannibal film. It is only a disappointment because I expected a great one... and while I really liked this movie I cannot rightfully say it compares to the pure terror of Cannibal Holocaust... but then again, I can't think of another film that does.",1452816000,,1752,4.555555555555555
7445002,4,B015N8JH84,"Everyone needs to realize you can't just give a movie 1 star because it had 1 thing you don't like about it, and 5 things you did like. When horror lovers sit down, they need to realize every horror film is unique in many ways (modern horror too) and try to see the good in them, not just 1 or two bad things about it. This movie is extremely original. I am not a big fan of Roth, but I love producer Blum, most of his movies are fantastic (successful Paranormal Series that came to an amazing interesting end, Purge, Sinister, Insidious, etc.) and this movie was amazing! I cringed while watching when the craziness started about 45 mins into the movie, and the movie was pretty UN-PREDICTABLE. Only thing I wish, which seems to be a big issue with modern horror (don't read this the wrong way, I love modern horrors) was maybe an extra 20 minutes of running time. Specifically in the beginning & the end. The beginning could've had a little more placement for characters & the tribe in the forest, and the ending could've been a little more longer for stylistic/suspense tension reasons with the main characters ""Hollywood"" lie. Don't get me wrong, I prefer more stylistic horrors (Orphan, PA, Sinister, Insidious, The Gallows, Unfriended), but how Roth chose to show the realism in this movie was so well done!!!

7445007,4,B015N8JH84,"Eli Roth has acquired a mixed reputation among film critics in general, and horror fans in particular.  There appears to be a consensus that he is a smart and talented individual, but in among the scattered positive reviews his films earn, the majority of reviewers, both professional and amateur, seem compelled to suggest that he is squandering his abilities with lesser material.
That's too bad; Roth is clearly a keen student of film history, and he chooses to make the films he wants, which is fine with me. Personally,  I have no interest seeing Roth take on Jane Austen.
So in last year's The Green Inferno, Roth pays homage to the narrow genre of cheesy 80's Italian gorefests like ""Cannibal Holocaust,"" and in case you somehow manage to miss the point, Roth goes out of his way to list an impressively thorough filmography of similarly inspirational titles while the credits roll.
Mainstream critics were not kind to The Green Inferno. Some seem offended  by Roth's themes, particularly the--gulp! extremely un-PC notion that a group of socially-minded and energetic youth, rather than doing something productive with their time such as, say, going on Rachel Maddow to demonstrate solidarity with their schools striking janitors,  choose instead to fly down to the Peruvian rain forest and confront the despoiling machinery of Big Business, even if it means risking catching a bullet from mercenaries, or being unwittingly sacrificed for the Cause.  That such a noble (if naive) effort might fail spectacularly  owing, at least in part, to SJW-minded hubris, seems particularly unacceptable to some critics.
Nevertheless, our stalwart students plan actually succeeds, right up until our heroes begin flying off into the sunset, when they suddenly remember this is an Eli Roth movie, and commence dying with sudden gruesome precision, by fall, by crush, by propeller, and---most disagreeablyby ingestion, courtesy of a local tribe of cannibals, whose ravenous smiles suggest it has been a while since anyone enjoyed a good hamstring,
Unlike the immodestly-clothed villagers you remember from your grandfather's National Geographic collection, these natives are varnished in crimson,  which contrasts nicely with Roths verdant forest-scapes. (The director has suggested he sought a palate more  in keeping with Vittorio Storaro than the desaturated tones of his Italian predecessors.)
The cast is game (sorry), but is tasked with doing little beyond acting dismayed by their predicament. On the plus side,  Roths better half (Lorenza Izzo) makes for an attractive heroine, and the numerous practical effects are appropriately horrific.

I loved -and prefer- these other movies much better, and prefer those over this movie.  The effects and gore seemed to be top notch.  BETTER THAN ""GREEN INFERNO"".  And Better stories.  Imagine: 1970s cannibal movies were better!  Even effects to me were better.  And a lot more gory. Oh well.

On Hostel the story line and character development is intriguing as the film goes.  In this its more about lets see how much fake blood we can make shoot out of hidden tubes.  About half way through I just considered turning it off.  Such a bad movie this is a film degenerates will watch while listening to their ICP and hang the poster next to their Scarface poster.

The basic story is a group of activists go to the jungle for their cause, things go wrong, they get caught by a cannibal tribe & things get very bad from there. The gore effects are very well done & the kills brutal so if that's not your thing then id avoid this movie, for those that enjoy that you will like this film. The cast does a good job, one in particular makes you dislike him so much you want something really bad to happen to him in the film while rooting for the others to find some way to escape.

The cannibal scene in Bone Tomahawk is more cringe worthy and shocked me more.

7445037,3,B015N8JH84,"Boy, I waited a LONG time for this.  As not only an Eli Roth fan, but a huge cannibal fan as well, I eagerly anticipated this movie's release.  Does it deliver or disappoint?  I enjoyed it: good clean cannibal fun ensues when an idealistic college student (Roth's real life wife, she is now guaranteed a roles in his movies forever, or until a divorce) becomes involved with some not-so-nice and not somewhat shady activists. The plot is not too bad and the end is nice; the movie is also filmed beautifully.  The contrast of the students with the painted natives against the lush green forest is quite gorgeous. But what you really want to know is about the cannibalism and how gory is the movie, right?  Well, I think it could use MORE cannibalism and MORE gore . . . but I have a high tolerance for such things.  Therefore, for the AVERAGE viewer, I think you will find an adequate amount of cannibalism and gore.  There are also hateful characters to root against and nice characters to root for, as well as ""bad"" natives and ""good"" natives.

Don't quite understand why they were going to circumcise the main character - would she have been spared death and brought into the village after this? Or later served up as chow?

Ironic that the people they first protested, the contractors, wound up saving the main character. But, I don't know why she spoke up to save the natives though. Maybe the one kid deserved saving, that's about it.",1451520000,4,594,4.647619047619048

The third huge flop in a row from Eli Roth, who really needs to stick to minor roles in Tarantino flicks and acknowledge he'd not a writer or a director, just another wealthy actor who thinks he should be in the director's chair. If only M. Night Shamalan and Roth were together on the plane, I'd have enjoyed this movie more.

7445045,5,B015N8JH84,"First of all, I just finished this movie and it will take me a bit to take it all in, which is a great sign of a terrific horror movie. However, I am reading these other reviews and can tell you that at NO time, did I take this movie to be racist or pro-animal activist!  Come on people!! You are going to PC this industry right out the window! To say this is racist ( against whom, I have NO idea) or that because no animals were harmed that it wasn't true ""cannibalist horror"" movie!! Put your big boy pants on and just don't watch it if violence offends you, it's called a MOVIE for a reason.
Now, as for my actual review.  What I have always really liked about Eli Roth's films is that they start out bright and sunny with a chance for you to get to know to the main characters which he does again with Green Inferno. It's nice to develop a character like Justine and Jonah so that when the bad stuff starts going down you actually do feel real sympathy for them, both characters were acted terrifically well, by the way.  Since I am of the age when movies weren't allowed to show violence towards real animals then I have not seen Cannibal Holocaust, nor do I care to, because I don't want to see live animals tortured and killed. So, to those of us under 50, quit wondering about that other movie and trying to compare it. This is a movie made by someone who understands you don't actually have to kill something to make a movie, that is why it is again, called a MOVIE with ""special effects"".
The scenery and cinematography are fantastic and the twist on how the college students turned up kidnapped by the same tribe they came to protect is priceless horror film making.  Anyone who remembers what is like to be a college freshman can kind of understand how these kids got themselves into this situation in the first place. They were trying to fit in, trying to make a positive change in the world and then we see them ruthlessly used as pawns by a government activist who specializes in using fresh young, sensitive minds. Especially the one whose father is a lawyer for the United Nations.
The real villain, just like in so many Roth films isn't so much the one who perpetrated the violence but in the ""ordinary people"" who stood to profit from it. Saving the rainforest still is a good cause and I know most people aren't ignorant enough to let a movie deflect them from that. Overall, it's creepy, gruesome, unsettling and has one of the best endings I've seen in a while! Make sure and watch through the credits!
I say a big Bravo to Roth! And, hope for a sequel and answer to that mystery ending.
And a big ""grow up"" for you guys that watch a movie about cannibals and get offended by violence.
I think a very poiniant scene is at the end when Justine is forced to stay on her side of the river with the human cannibals or cross it and take her chances with a wild leopard, she inevitably chooses to cross and take her chances with the leopard. Can't say that I blame her! Again, good show!",1451088000,2,3004,4.311504424778761
7445046,3,B015N8JH84,"Actually 3/2 stars is my judgement call. I waited for what seemed like forever to see this and while waiting I read every review I could find. Some called the film far too gruesome, while others complained about it being not gruesome enough. Still many complained there was too much humor in the movie. As far as humor goes it's not really all that directly humorous. It's more of a subtle humor that goes on here. And once things get ugly there isn't much in the way of humor except one line I can recall. The thing that bothered me is this movie got built up for me so much that I really was expected something so vile and brutal that it would haunt me for months. Given Roth's Hostel films, it's easy to understand why I would feel a bit apprehensive, those two films, especially the first one are merciless, horrifying and gruesome as hell. Here I thought Roth would give us his opus, his most grueling film to date. But sadly the movie never does go far enough to really make one feel the audience has been subjected to something that would make them leave the theater traumatized, as was the case when many people saw Cannibal Holocaust. I realize some have complained that it isn't quite kosher to compare Roth's vision with that film. But considering Roth willingness in the past to get down, dark and nasty with horror, one would think he'd be up for the task of making something so brutal and unsettling that it leaves a memorable reflection in the mind.

Unfortunately when the carnage get's started, though it goes for the jugular and it is gut wrenching within the first 10 minutes of the grueling stuff, one would hope and expect it would keep getting more brutal and more horrific, but instead it feels like Roth is having mercy on his audience and the film backs off, and the carnage sort of takes a dive. One thing that made Cannibal Holocaust work so well is that it left no hope for any of it's victims. They all die in a horrifying symphony of brutality rarely seen on film. Cannibal Holocaust is unforgiving and unmerciful. It is foreboding and hopeless. It's not just the grim music that made it work, or the actual killing of animals. Those two products, if you will, actually stayed in the minds of many who had seen that film for a long time. We seem to remember quite well how icy cold and grim the music was and how horrific the animal killings were. But had the film ended without the graphic killings of the humans involved it would never have been considered the great classic mother of all horror films. It all went hand in hand. The music the animal cruelty and the brutal killings of the people involved. But instead Roth decides to retreat somewhat and that is what let me down.

Roth's use of 4k cinematography gives the film a striking appearance but at the cost of sacrificing a certain kind of mood and gritty feel. it still works well, but the use of 4k does seem to give the film too much of a polished feeling rather than a foreboding darkness. Some grimmer music also would have helped The Green Inferno. But I think the main issue here is again that the carnage get's things going just the way we were hoping, but then because it backs off a bit after those moments, it seems a bit of a letdown. I was thinking ""My god, that was pretty sick, and man it is only getting started, this is going to be one grueling experience. But after the first 10 minutes of brutality it just never goes any further than that, and though I enjoyed the film over all, I felt really letdown that Roth didn't just go for it and get as merciless as can be imagined. Maybe even do his best to outdo Deodato. Why not when he's been known for giving audiences more brutality than they can take in the past. I felt he should have pulled out all the stops and just gave us the ultimate nasty experience, otherwise what's the point? I mean after all it's a cannibal flick. They've been done before. Why not take it on and get down a ugly with it?

The acting was actually not bad, but seemed slightly juvenile earlier on in the film, and rather almost ""aww-shucks"". Kind of like a cheesy after school special during the earlier portion of the movie. I also felt that when things get ugly the reactions of the characters were sometimes not convincing. Though they seemed terrified when they are first captured, they are less so when their friends start dying, and that seemed a little off. Over all this is not a bad horror movie at all. If there had never been another cannibal film to compare this with I think people would have considered this something of a new horror classic. I think comparing this to other cannibal films is what hurts the movie. I think the best audience for this movie might be people who like strong horror but who have never seen any of the other cannibal movies. I think I would have been more satisfied had that been my case.",1451088000,,4869,4.425863991081382
7445047,4,B015N8JH84,"The Green Inferno was a wonderful surprise, yet exactly what I expected. A new take on the Cannibal films of the late 70s early 80s. The scenery was beautiful and the acting superb. But the score was what left me feeling not so nostalgic,although good in it's own right. The early cannibal films had music that really set the mood.

The gore was awesome and there was quite a bit of it. There were characters I rooted for and characters I really hated,similar to the early films. I believe Horror lovers will want to see this film ,if not for the hype but for the reality of the quality of the film.

There was a really good dismemberment scene ,eyeballs gouged out,then used as hors d'oeuvres,Several severed heads and more gore galore!

No animals were tortured so that to me was a plus. It wasn't anywhere as raw as the originals but it has it's own merits on which it stands. It's a fun gory ride from start to finish and definatley leaves open the possibility of a sequel. Keep watching during the credits for a nice little (oh Hell no) moment!",1449792000,2,1049,4.453125

I guess I would just read all the bad reviews and pure entertainment and see for yourself how good this movie really is. My advice for all you would-be critics out there. Just stop. Nobody cares.,1448755200,4,485,4.465909090909091
7445049,3,B015N8JH84,"Reviewing this is a mixed bag of emotions. If I was to review it on the gore, and makeup alone then its brilliant. But being an honest reviewer you cant just rate a movie on a one sided reality. I am a fan of Eli Roth, and his simple world of gory horror. One thing I enjoyed about Green Inferno was the throwback to 70's and 80's Grindhouse films. I have a wicked love for Cabin Fever, Hostel and Hostel 2. I am one who enjoyed Hostel 2 more than part 1. Now lets make something very clear, Roth is not one that make scary movies. His ability is not scary, its gross out, or simply put, to cause a reaction of a disturbing nature. From that stand point he works. None of the mentioned films are scary. The films mentioned are the definition of horror, and The Green Inferno is a definition of horror. Horror states an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust. Roth gives the disgust with a crystal clear clarity that he works so well at. If I was to rate on that reality then this film is a Golden Ticket. But I don't rate films that way.

The plot is very simple. A corporation is tearing down the rain forest, and murdering local tribes inside the forest. An activist group decides to go to the Amazon, and make a political stand. Joining the group is college freshman Justine who basically comes aboard because she is attracted to the leader of the group. Once in the Amazon it doesnt go as planned.
The Green Inferno has all that shocking, bloody murder moments, and disgusting gore that you would expect from a film paying homage to such gems like Cannibal Holocaust, and all over the top films of the 70s and 80s that explored the depravity of cannibalistic tribes, and flesh eating humans.

The Green Inferno has its major flaws. Character development it lacks greatly. Certain moments are ludacris, and had no purpose or bearing in the film such as the masturbation shot. Yes it was created, to make the character all the more hated, but was unrealistic in his actions. The other problem was the CGI. I am not against good CGI. What I am against is bad CGI. Its okay to have CGI in horror films as long its done right. The ants in this film on a particular person, was so fake looking, and godawful that it had me rolling my eyes at how stupid they looked.

The movie is a rehash of all the older 70s and 80s film of this nature. It basically pays homage to the classics. Nothing will ever beat Cannibal Holocaust, and I am not saying that The Green Inferno tried to, what I am saying, sometimes the same storyline, or plot to films become a little boring. Watching The Green Inferno you as the viewer already knew what was going to happen. It didn't take a rocket scientist to know what was going to happen next. That is also the plus about this movie. You go into these films for simple, gory entertainment. Sometimes you hope that at least there will be a story, or something new to praise, but in the end most of the time its the same thing over, and over again, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt.

The Green Infernos stake in the heart was that it suffered limbo for over 2 years. Created in 2013, and finally saw the light of day in 2015. The problem that happens with this is people start to anticipate, and come up with ideas of how truly disturbing it is. People build a mythos around the film that never lives up to the hype. The Green Inferno I think suffered from that reality. The buildup was great. Also when a movie is in limbo it becomes fair game to online illegal postings. The Green Inferno was one of those films that people could watch illegal down loads, and could easily find online. In reality, the film suffered financial problems and not because of content. It was in limbo because of money.

The other problem with the film is there is no real likable characters other then 2. I enjoyed the character of Lars, played by the wonderful young actor Daryl Sabara. I have been a fan of Sabara for many years. I loved him as Juni in the Spy Kids films. He is a great natural talent behind the lens. He was funny in the part of Lars, and ultimately made you believe his reality. The next character that stood out was Aaron Burns as the character of Jonah. Now a little trivia for you. Aaron has worked with Roth, and this Rat Pack of Splat group of Quentin Tarantino, Eli Roth, and Robert Rodriguez. Burns is also, besides an actor, a visual effects artist working on 2007s Grindhouse, and Planet Terror, 2007s Machete, and 2013s The Green Inferno, also working the graphic design department of 2005s Sin City. Plus Burns is also in two other related Roth films. Eli presented and produced 2014s The Stranger, Burns is the character of Officer Harris in The Stranger. Burns plays Louis in Eli Roths 2015 Knock Knock.

The Green Inferno is co-written by Roth, and also Guillermo Amoedo. Both have worked together before on 2012s Aftershock, Roth as I have stated produced Amoedos films, 2014s The Stranger. They also worked together on Roths new 2015 movie, Knock Knock. That is something else unique about Green Inferno, many of the actors or behind the scenes people have been a part of the same team in many films. Lorenza Izzo who plays Justine, your main lead in Green Inferno has also been a part of Aftershock, Roths Hemlock Grove, The Stranger, and Knock Knock. You see, she is married to Roth. So I guess its a great reality when you have an actress, and a director as a married couple.

Green Inferno also stars Ariel Levy who has worked in Aftershock, The Stranger. Nicolas Martinez who also has starred in Aftershock. Ignacia Allamand who also starred in Aftershock and Knock Knock.

The two main characters that are truly amazing, and disturbing is the two main baddies. The Head Hunter who is amazingly played by Ramon Llao, he also played in Aftershock. His character of Head Hunter is one that stands out, and is an imagery of disturbing forcefulness that lingers with you. Next would be the Character of The Village Elder, played by Antonieta Pari. Pari is amazing in this part and another one of those movie characters that makes you remember them. Both Llao and Pari are true cinema monsters.

I also have to mention the beautiful cinematography. The places it was filmed was amazing. The shoots in Peru and Chile are stunning and give a realistic reality to the film.

So I am going to rate this film a little different. I am going to use a number chart. 10 being the best. 1 being the worst. I want to rate this film different because of the categories. Some of the realities of the film stand out and also for fans of these styles of horror films, get them, enjoy them. Some will like, and some will not. There is a huge fan base to cannibal films, and for that reason I rate this movie differently.

Gore: 9 out of 10
Makeup: 10 out of 10
CGI: 2 out of 10
Acting: 6 out of 10
Direction: 6 out of 10
Storyline: 4 out of 10
Music Score: 8 out of 10
Film Rating: 5 out of 10

Final Verdict: For fans of gory horror. Lovers of cannibal films. Movies paying homage to 70s and 80s Grindhouse films, then I feel its a must. For the average movie lover, I don't think you will get this style of film. This is geared to a select audience of gore-whores and 70s and 80s Drive-in Grindhouse film lovers.

On a funny note, I made my mother watch this. She flinched and covered her eyes in many of the violent, and over the top gore moments that Roth captured in great detail. He elicited an emotional response from my mother, which he accomplished perfectly.",1448409600,2,7508,4.420101229211858

7445053,1,B015N8JH84,"I will be reviewing this film on a few different levels. First review is side by side with the old school cannibal films. (Yes, there was more then just Cannibal Holocaust). Pretty much all the old school cannibal films were exploitation films and over the top in many different areas of insane. This film is really tame in all of those areas. And actually there is really only 1 violent scene in the entire film. 1 scene of nudity, kinda. And thats it. Which is confusing since Roth is known for Gore and Exploitation films *Ex. Hostel. And he has claimed to be a really big fan of the old cannibal films.....so what went wrong?!

Im going to be hard on this film review because I actually like Roths Cabin fever and Hostel films. I had high expectations for his new take on the old cannibal films. Next review level is on a Roth film. Which again fails, the guy can make good films so what happened with this? Maybe he was over his head in a bigger scale film? The whole movie is a big joke. Takes 45 minutes for ANYTHING TO HAPPEN! Then when it gets going, poor writting and Troma jokes (Where Roth got his start) Take over and ruin the horror.

Last Level review is just on an entertaining film putting aside the old cannibal films and Roth older films. And in that case, it again fails. Terrible acting (And I mean, really really bad....kinda like they maybe did the film for free acting), weak violence, 0 terror, no rewatch value, just a really lame film all together.

In closing, I respect Roth as a film maker and going into the jungle to work with real cannibals. I respect he didn't kill animals real or fake for the sake of making the movie stand out in the news. The only part I enjoyed in the movie was when the lead got painted up all white, that was on target and reminded me of some of the older films. I waited like 4 years or so to view this film and it was a waste of time. Based on the 3 levels I reviewed this film I cant recommend this to anyone....Watch Jess Franco's CANNIBALS instead. Atleast that way you will have fun.",1445817600,4,2047,4.2979274611398965

7445055,4,B015N8JH84,"Minus one star for some actors and actresses, who I found irritating to watch and listen to.  Also, there is practically no nudity (not counting in of course the cannibal tribe) nor not to mention sex scenes, which are none existent.  Its is definitely not as sexually explicit nor as realistic as Cannibal Holocaust (1980).  However, that being said -- I still found the film horrifying and disturbingly gorish to watch.  The movie also does not have any soundtrack...and if it does, it sure does not add any special effect.  The film is mediocre up until 45th or so minute.  From than on, it gets interesting with every passing minute.  I like the ending too...and the special effects in regards to body mutilations, cut off limbs and other bodily parts are done exceptionally well.

The story revolves around NYC students who travel to Peru as an activist group (something along the lines of Greenpeace organization) in order to stop deforestation of a rain forest. An incident occurs and the group gets stranded in the middle of a jungle.  Soon enough they get caught by an indigenous tribe, which happens to feast on human flesh...will they be able to survive? who will die first and who will die second?

7445058,2,B015N8JH84,"A number of comments have been that ""The Green Inferno"" is not a retread of ""Cannibal Holocaust"".  That is a good thing, because as compared to ""Cannibal Holocaust"" it is nowhere near as gritty, gory, or disturbing.  In fact, given that we have had something like 35 or 40 years of technology in the movie industry, the special effects were disappointing, that is, when they were used.  If you are looking for gore, Eli Roth had quite a bit more in his Hostel movie series.  The cinematography was well done and visually the movie is very rich.  However, the actual ""gore"" special effects of the film were not much better, if even as good, as the much older Holocaust, or even ""Cannibal Ferox"".  The plot was somewhat original, with some twists. While some reviewers have said it shouldn't be compared to the older movies of this genre, it is difficult to make a cannibal themed film and not have it viewed in light of those that were made before it.  Rather than compare it CH, if compared to either Hostel or Hostel 2, the movie is somewhat flat in both special effects, and the portrayed fate of a number of the characters.  Much is left to the imagination, in this film's case, probably too much.  Unfortunately, the movie in my opinion, didn't live up to the hype which preceded it.",1445212800,7,1287,4.560869565217391

7445060,4,B015N8JH84,"Theres something very off with Eli Roths latest horror film The Green Inferno, but I cant quite place exactly what it is. Its possible that its too broad to pinpoint, because the whole movie has this surreal and otherworldly feel. Its the kind of film youd stumble upon in a deep, dank corner of some video store in the 80s. Or better, on an unmarked VHS tape in your friends attic. Its definitely not something that youd expect to see with a huge audience on a Saturday night. But, surprisingly enough, thats exactly how I experienced it.

We follow a group of student activists from a New York City university who venture to the Amazon in order to save the rainforest. Theyre a bit naive and aren't fully aware of the potentially dangerous situation, and matters are made worse when their plane crashes in the middle of the green landscape. Soon enough, they're surrounded by a tribe of cannibals who kidnap them and plan to eat each and every one of them alive. Its a story-line thats likely to come off as either completely ridiculous or incredibly terrifying, but the movie never fully reaches either extremes.

I cant say that I was ever scared by what was happening on-screen, but there was something about the perverse, unapologetic nature of the film that intrigued me. The acting isn't particularly good, and neither is the movie as a whole, but I found it to be a fascinating watch. Eli Roth always brings controversial images to the screen (most notably with his Hostel franchise), and  his latest is no different. There will be some that simply cant sit through a film like this - and I can certainly understand why - but theres undoubtedly a place for these gory, throwback slashers in todays cinema. Seeing an unusual film like this on the big-screen was a bizarre experience, but an enjoyable one nonetheless.",1445126400,8,1825,4.714733542319749
7445061,4,B015N8JH84,"So finally the anticipated release of Roth's homage to the Italian stable of all things mangiati vivi emerges. Certainly the direction is luscious and the vibrant greens of the flora is a contrast to the reds of the pigmentation of the indigenous villagers and the blood letting which , on occassion, is graphic but very well orchestrated. Admittedly Roth had potentially one of the most difficult genres to bring to a 'hyper sensitive' audience of 2015 in comparison to a much more liberal, carefree and 'harder' 70's/80's audience and the balance he has achieved admirably. One cannot help compare Green Inferno to it's stablemates and what Roth has successfully achieved is pleasing a 'new' audience and keeping happy legions of fans who, through their admiration, has made such grindhouse fayre as 'Cannibal Holocaust', 'Cannibal Ferox' , 'Deep River Savages' et al into cult films. Such films, in some cases deemed 'unmentionable' are now worthy of appraisal and in some instances given a scholarly treatment where as before was considered by self opinionated critics as 'grindhouse trash', which rather embarrassingly has highlighted how cinematically ignorant these 'critics' are/were.
Regrettably the scourge of political correctness and the 'tread on eggshells' culture we have been steered into by our self appointed (and opinionated) moral guardians has meant a few unsavoury things associated with movies of this ilk are held back that Roth could (and probaly would've loved) to have staged but overall he has seemed to triumph in not only bringing us a slice of grand guignol adventure but providing enough nauseating episodes of cruelty to keep the bloodthirsty members of the audience happy. The film also works on many, many levels combining politics, the misanthropic, dark humour and absolute irony; the latter two you would be able to spot if you have a comprehension of schadenfreude.
Some of it is a little 'pristine' and you certainly know you are watching a film where as the older cannibal films has a sweatiness and scuzziness (in some cases you can almost smell the B.O from the screen); which has somehow been lost - perhaps this is due to the format used for filming ? Due to this sleaziness with the old school methods you sometimes forget you are watching a 'film', and the documentary vibe is so dominant in it's juxtaposition it  makes the older entries all the more unsettling than this modern appreciation.
If you take away the publicity and compare the new to the old you could know from the get go that the actors in the 2015 variant are quite, quite safe where back in the day , and if you were unaware, you could genuinely question whether the actors and actresses were protected from the perils of the Amazon and most likely comparing Health and Safety in 2015 to 1972, 1979 or 1980 (if it existed back then - probably not) has also got something to do with it as well. Despite this it doesn't let the movie down as I , as a viewer, viewed this and put the films before it aside and am attempting to review The Green Inferno purely on it's own merit where I can  although it's stablemates do have such an important part to play I cannot push them aside completely. I found myself unashamedly thinking of what scenes have been emulated - and am pleased to say Roth's spin on these have been done very well indeed and it's obvious he adores this genre as much as I - thank you!!
I felt some Animal Cruelty (using CGI as we have the technology now) wouldn't of gone amiss just to intensify the experience and maybe the ant sequence could've been replaced by a piranha fishing scene which never made it to Deodato's edit. Such criticism however are only minor blemishes on an overall 'accomplished' project and ten out of ten for a director who wants to tackle this type of genre and (to re-iterate until I am blue in the face) in such 'safe' times and without the 'zeitgeist' safety net of it's predecessors.
The actors themselves were quite convincing and on the whole portrayed 'detestable' very well but not a patch on the vile westerners in Holocaust, a film which I feel will never be equalled and thankfully Roth has steered clear of focussing his energies on being the same as or trying to surpass -  as this is the definitive of the genre with, of course, Ferox (although much 'trashier') coming a very close second.
Other characters were pure two dimensional cannon fodder which is not a negative as in such films one needs a high body count to showcase a variety of denouements, which is part and parcel of the 'thrill' of the cinematic journey.
The main female protagonist was very good and echoed Lorraine De Salles character from 'Ferox' but as it's 2015 was much more 'emancipated'. Although she didn't seem to be particularly messed up as De Salle at the ending which surprised me after such an ordeal. The ending, without spoiling it, does have capacity for a re-make but personally , I feel, it doesn't warrant it as what has been accomplished is enough.
Perhaps another attempt is warranted but with an entirely different 'cannibal' movie all together. One thing I loved was the 'dedicated to...' credits which listed a brief history of Green Infernos inspirations I feel it is wrong and selfish of modern directors to steer clear of thanking the those that have given inspiration when you know full well , if you have the knowledge, that what is presented and marketed as 'new' is meerly a rip off of something independent that has faded from the publics memory or is simply deemed too obscure and was made a long time before. For this I would definately have to mention the majority of stalk and slash material that are re-workings of Bava's 1971 'Bay of Blood' - good grief we owe that man so much ! However, I want to clarify that in no way Green Inferno is a rip off merely a 'variation on a theme' as it stands up well as a film in it's own right and refeshingly Roth lovingly nods towards it's cousins.
Overall I was pleasently surprised by this offering but one has to view it on it's own merit and try to avoid comparing it to those wonderful nuggets of sleaze that played on 42nd Street before the armani boys took over and sanitised everything in the name of making money. I hope Roth continues to surprise us with revivals such as this and would love it if  he may consider re-imaging De Ossorio, I am sure he could really pull it out of the bag with a 'Tombs of the Blind Dead' remake although the recent, excellent and in my opinion 'must see'  -  'Morituris' nods in that direction and successfully pulls off a fusion of genres that were a lot nastier than Green Inferno - perhaps a collaboration by both directors on the next Cannibal film wouldn't go amiss as one director would push forward with the nhilism and gruel where the other one holds back in visualising the unmentionable and the nasty.
As a footnote and from some reviews I have looked at some class this as racist - this is baffling - how can something fantastical and make believe , something that is essentially a morality play be racist ? It seems the word racist is being liberally applied to everything these days and I find it baffling - people will be called this for liking doves over crows next . Roth is not saying that all indigenous peoples are like this but in film land he is saying a tribe , or a few, could be.
I would hate to think what the tie dye brigade would say if Roth decided on re-making 'Goodbye Uncle Tom ' , well I probably could imagine and would applaud him in his defiance at sticking an index finger up to such kill joys - you stick to your rom coms and marxist beliefs and we will stick to our enjoyment of cinema - deal or possibly do as what the main protagonists in this film did.",1445126400,2,7750,4.616388687454677
7445062,4,B015N8JH84,"Well it's about TIME! I've been waiting 2 years for this movie and I finally got a chance to see it. I'm a huge Eli Roth fan (as I've stated in most of my reviews) and I'm glad that this movie he didn't disappoint! Unlike his latest turd, Knock Knock (2015), this movie actually lives up to Roth's ""gory"" reputation. Now, I will say that prior to seeing this movie, I thought Lorenza Izzo was not a very good actress. Having only seen her in ""Knock Knock"" (and HATING that movie), I wasn't expecting much. However, she completely changed my mind.

The story follows Justine (Izzo), a college freshman that is genuinely concerned about the well beings of native tribes and other regions. Wanting to help make a difference, she joins a group on campus that is planning a trip to the Amazon rain forest in an attempt to stop the destruction of the local tribes and their surroundings.

Unfortunately for Izzo and the rest of her group, things don't exactly turn out as they were hoping. After taking care of business, they attempt to head home when their plane's engine blows and they nose dive. Sadly, the very native they are attempting to save turn out not to be much of the ""friendly"" type.

*******spoilers ahead*******
At this point we are 45 minutes in, and THIS is where the movie becomes what we are all watching it for (like waiting on a crash in a NASCAR race). The (surviving) members are quickly thrown into a cage (most of em, anyways) and forced to watch what happens when you journey to other people's land. Unfortunately, Carlos (Matas Lpez) has it all WRONG! Those cell phones DON'T make good weapons. This is also the point in the movie where the typical stuff happens that takes you away from the moment. Case in point: Amy (Kirby Bliss Blanton) decides she can't hold her bowels and what follows is more reminiscent of Jeff Daniel's laxative scene in Dumb and Dumber than any horror movie. Granted, I can see that happening to a very frightened person, but the movie could have done without the little ""fart"" noises that added nothing but kid humor to an otherwise uncomfortable scene. Also, I can't really see an entire tribe that feeds daily on God knows WHAT, being completely stoned from what looks to be a dime bag of weed? While I'm on the subject, if I'm about to get eaten, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't utter the line, ""Oh no, they got the munchies!"" Or maybe I would, who knows?!

All in all, I found this to be a fun return to what Roth fans have been missing since 2007's, Hostel II.

The movie wasn't as good as I was hoping it would but it wasn't terrible either.

They're two seperate films with two different directors so of course they aren't going to be identical! This is a great film, however the ending could be a little unclear it is still an overall entertaining, gruesome film. It is by far in my opinion better than Cannibal Holocaust though. The only thing gory about the Cannibal Holocaust is them actually killing animals, besides that it's weaksauce! The focus on Roths film is the actual cannibal tribe and the students who remained trapped in the jungle. Its trully gruesome to the core. Decapatition of limbs, removal of human eyeballs, and even the preparation of the human corpse to be cooked. This movie trully lives up to gore and roth did a great job. Its a must watch and must buy.",1443657600,4,904,4.764331210191083
7445068,5,B015N8JH84,"Unexpectedly suspenseful grindhouse/gore ""pulp"" tale (story by the director, Eli Roth) features the lovely Lorenza Izzo as a routine college student who gets inadvertently suckered in to joining a gang of nave, idealistic fellow students whose motto is ""don't think...act""--and when Justine (portrayed by Izzo) decides to act and allow herself to get involved, she becomes part of a doomed expedition to stop the devastation of an Amazon rainforest that is being exploited by the West. If I say anymore, you may as well not even bother with watching the picture, but rest assured it is never less than gripping, revolting, and unexpectedly surprising.
Be forewarned, if you are at all squeamish about the idea of cannibalism even, then you had best stay away from this movie--but Roth's savage and unrelenting brutality actually presents one of the best metaphors for animal rights that I ever been forced to stomach in a film. While indescribably cruel on some levels, Roth's method of introducing you to characters that you can get involved with and then jerking their safety out from underneath your feet is as effective a cinematic storytelling device as one can hope for. I had to turn my head slightly during some scenes, and at times felt as if my lunch were going to start traveling the wrong way, but I endured it and I am grateful for the experience. If you don't enjoy tension, suspense, and savagery, then please don't watch this (certainly not alone, like I did!), but if you can take it, it is certainly one of the best adventure pictures that I have seen in some time.
Some have been griping about the lack of grim extremities that they think Roth held back on here--and be sure, the film does not include genital mutilation or severe animal cruelty that the old Deodato and Lenzi classics contain, but for my taste I'm glad that the film didn't go to the outer limits of bad taste (and, for Western audiences, I think we've seen the last of THAT kind of Italian exploitation brutality in mainstream theaters). It's best not to think of Roth trying to remake ""Cannibal Holocaust"" here, because this is an original story and one that takes its own path into the hell of a world that the modern day civilians of the present time cannot even imagine. This is probably about as savage a film as we will get in a mainstream theatrical setting, and while Roth's vision does use delay and avoidance in specific things that MIGHT have been shown, I think this only goes further in building the graphic gut-twirling suspense. It may not be as visually sick in mind as the Deodato classic, but it is probably worse than some of those Deodato-influenced Italian films in its impact upon the psyche (certainly the more fragile ones amongst us). In the end, it is the feeling that counts here, not the onscreen blood and guts, and for that intensity and power I am awarding this film an outstanding rating.
I also have to add that the cast does quite a good job overall, and I don't understand anyone's criticism of the acting in this film. And, Antonio Quercia's blazingly bright cinematography goes a long towards making Roth's eerie vision into a real motion picture experience, and no addition of silly 3-D effects were required to jack up the huge intensity of the overall impact. If you are going into this picture cold, you may get sick to your stomach while viewing it, but for those of us who are sick of the cinema playing it safe all the time, this is one grueling exercise in terror that at least makes the effort at setting things right for future no-holds-barred film projects. And as a fan of anything set in the jungle (don't ask me why, it's just something I enjoy in a cinematic sense), I have to point out that this is also an adventure movie and that it is truly as effective as any other jungle film that I have yet witnessed.
I have always believed that gut-level exploitation film-making should resemble the Vietnam War more so than the comfortable confines of Hollywood movie studios (one of Roth's admitted inspirations here was Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now""), and this practical approach to hardcore film creation is one thing about Roth's aesthetic that I wholeheartedly agree with. But the images from this film have been alive in my mind for days, and it's not easily shaken off from memory once seen. It is a completely visceral experience that burrows deep into one's gut and will not leave until you experience an expulsion (either from mind, or from gut) a few days later. The only drawback to this picture is that Roth's savage imagery actually takes us out of his (rather solipsistic) point that he is trying to make about social media and fraudulent attempts at idealistic, misguided cultural activism. But how can that be a valid criticism in truth when the picture's vicious qualities lift it into a truly frightening (and often admittedly unpleasant) fantasy/thriller area in which the fear truly surrounds the minds of everyone watching? Call it torture-porn if you so choose, but you won't easily be able to forget the movie and that means that the movie-making here is grotesquely effective. I don't really think that the humor works though, because it operates in an arena that is much too cruel for such misplaced attempts at tension relieving levity. Still, the picture gave me the chills and had me genuinely alarmed during the second act, so my advice is see it if you really want to be shaken. If not, find the nearest exit.
Now I'm actually looking forward to see what ""Beyond the Green Inferno"" is about, as it is reportedly supposed to be far more frightening and gruesome than this film! Yikes...",1443657600,26,5647,4.75152749490835
7445069,3,B015N8JH84,"Green Inferno is a (welcome?) return to directing for Eli Roth who hasn't directed sh*t since Hostel  2, & coming from someone who's typically disappointed by him, I wasn't disappointed. See most of his movies take place in a dungeon somewhere but this film being made in a lush green environment with an authentic village of natives who haven't seen a movie before (until Roth came around with Cannibal Holocaust) were very convincing.

So we get a bunch of slacktivists who need to feel like they're making a difference in college so they embark on a tour to the Peruvian Amazon to stop the bulldozers & save the natives. After they make their big show with the 'corporations, man' the plane crashes & they wake up being held as livestock for the local village they were trying to save. The only thing more delicious than human flesh is irony.

So if I know Roth for anything, it's gore. His actors & directing aren't exactly top notch, so you go into one of his films looking to get disgusted. He pulled that off with the first kill, but failed to keep that momentum up the rest of the movie. It's like an awkward kid telling a joke but reveling the punch-line too early because they're uncomfortable with making you uncomfortable. The deaths later are some off-screen, some underwhelming (where did all the ants go?), & some just straight up funny. My biggest gripe with this movie is that Eli knew it becomes a comedy & had to keep winking at us, instead of not acknowledging the ridiculousness speak for itself (Killer Joe is a great example of doing this right). Making an awareness to the comedy pulled the curtain back too much & dissipated the first kill's shocking scene.

All in all Eli Roth isn't a bad director, he's just not a great one which the horror scene so desperately needs right now. The movie's still fun & I'd rather watch college kids get eaten alive than Will Ferrel fart than fall in love. You can imagine the limitations in shooting outdoors throughout the movie but still I'm glad it was done guerrilla style, if only the ending wasn't so contrived to be happy. Right when a circumcision is about to take place we get the call of the plot convenience which was the final nail on the coffin of the vibe the movie started off with so well. Minor gripes aside The Green Inferno is still a lot of fun if you love torture & gore, and I can promise you at least one scene that totally delivers the goods. Here's to hoping Return to the Green Inferno steps up on the gore!",1443657600,7,2495,4.501103752759382
7445070,4,B015N8JH84,"SPOILER ALERT:  There's a lot of carping in the horror hound community about Eli Roth's new film ""The Green Inferno"", an homage to 70s and 80s Italian cannibal films, the chief one being ""Cannibal Holocaust"", Ruggero Deodato's classic gore and shock fest.  The main gripes seem to be that Roth's film isn't nearly as gritty as those earlier firms and that the heroine escapes the female genital mutilation at the end.  Roth has stated that he was inspired by the cinematography of films like Werner Herzog's ""Fitzcarraldo"" which is known for stunning and lush photography of the South American jungle, the exact opposite of the grimy, sweat-soaked imagery from the Italian films.  He wanted the striking juxtaposition of the verdant, green jungle against the red skin color of the cannibals and, of course, the blood.  In that respect, it works brilliantly.  As far as the ending goes, the heroine's escape from her impending genital mutilation by the cannibals was, I think, necessary for several reasons.  Roth clearly wanted the character to survive, and if the quick scene which rolls over the end credits is any indication, she will be back in the sequel to deal with her decision to leave the bad guy behind and lie about it,  Plus, can you imagine the outcry from women's rights groups if Roth had gone there with the FGM?  Just the idea of it was enough to unsettle, which I believe was the point.  There's another issue that there have been complaints about - how could the bad guy not get his comeuppance?  Well, the heroine certainly thought he would by leaving him behind to be eaten.  Were people expecting her to kill him herself?  By leaving, she assumed he was getting his comeuppance, as did the audience.  But there is obviously more to the story.  Frankly, I have to scratch my head at some of the criticisms, especially that the acting was bad, which I did not find to be true.  There have been lots of comments about the ""sophomoric toilet humor"" because of the scene where one of the girls has violent diarrhea while caged up.  Folks, when people are scared out of their wits, they can defecate in that manner, uncontrollably.  Just ask any of the survivors of the trains to Auschwitz or those who watched the terrified being ushered into the gas chambers.  ""The Green Inferno"" is a smart, well-directed cannibal gore film and deserves a little better than the media and some fans are giving it.  A sequel was in the works, and may or may not still be, but I hope we see more of this story from Roth.",1443484800,79,2522,4.66289592760181
