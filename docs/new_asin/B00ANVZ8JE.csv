5462105,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"The workout is challenging and I consider myself moderately fit. After 6 weeks (3-4 times/week not 6 as recommended) I do notice a difference in tone and shape. The workouts are 30 min each, not an hour as occasionally stated. I do a modified version from what is recommended with my own cardio (not the dance routine) in the morning and toning workouts in the afternoon. These are great if you can't squeeze in a full hour, as they make it easy to divide up your workout. I do agree that a little more notice when the transitions on the exercises happen would be good, but overall I like the system and will keep using it.",1363219200,12,623,4.379310344827586
5462106,3,B00ANVZ8JE,"I must first say that I feel a little duped about spending $90 on this. For one thing, Tracy Anderson has ZERO credentials. I also think some of her stuff is dangerous. Her cardio workout is weird, it's just Tracy jumping around and staring at herself. Seriously, that is it! It's really high impact and bouncy. The ""diet"" plan she recommends is not safe. You alternate for one week drinking your meals (you'll need a juicer and something to puree ingredients with) and then the next week eating 3 little ""meals"". You're supposed to do this for all 90 days. I don't think it even adds up to 1,000 calories a day. She is not a dietitian, do not take her advice. She is always saying you can have a teeny tiny perfect body if you do what she says. Really? Teeny tiny = perfect. No wonder so many people have eating disorders.
I have to say, the only thing I like about these dvd's are the transformation workouts. They hurt really bad (in a good way). I believe in confusing your muscles, so I'll continue with this for a while (using zumba for cardio), then switch it up.
FYI, her ""transformation"" moves seem to be high rep pilate moves....",1362960000,14,1139,4.428571428571429
5462107,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"Tracy kicks my butt into shape! She offers music or no music, which is nice. Her movements hit all of the minor muscle groups that normal exercise doesn't even acknowledge.",1362441600,16,172,4.766666666666667
5462108,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I have used this program for over a year (am into Tracy's continuity program), but in reading the other review here I felt compelled to present an argument from someone who completed it and not just started complaining in the first month.

The first two ""facts"" (regarding choosing a food program and cardio) from the other reviewer have some validity... if you are not into following the dance portion and want to free flow as Tracy suggests... do it.  If you have another form of 30 minute cardio that is already your soulmate cardio, by all means I would agree to do that as well.  It is intended as a complement to the training as the movements will also work to hit the muscles groups that the Tracy Anderson Method is looking to transform.  For the first 90 days, I would say stick to her program as close as possible with the cardio but edit where needed.  For the first 90 days, I would say stick to her program as close as possible for the diet (which is largely vegetable based) because you will get lots of energy on it and it will get you started on the right track for feeling good and using food as FUEL not comfort.

I was not a fit person when I started this.  I was FAR from it.  And I am no angel when it comes to following a diet.  I've recently switched to Paleo and find it to be a good fit for me... maybe not for everyone, but for me.  Everyone is different.  With the Hipcentric program I lost 12 inches off my hips in 6 weeks.  My arms were toned and shapely, I stood taller, my abs were flatter, and I dropped 5 pant sizes over the 90 days.  The 30 minutes of the transform dvd's FLY by.  They are brilliant.  They are completely different than other workouts because they hit angles that others do not.

Each of the transform workouts consist of 15 minutes which will be the same regardless of which program you are following (hipcentric, glutecentric, omnicentric, abcentric).  This is arms, weighted arms, standing abs, laying abs.  The last 15 minutes is all based on the program... so for me, hipcentric, it was all leg/hip work.  Burning, searing, painful legwork (in a good way of course).  This is a strategic muscle exhaustion section and you will feel it the next day.  Every day.  You do 40 repetitions of each motion on each leg.  You have to follow the angles she is doing to get the correct intention... she even recommends using a mirror to make sure you are hitting it, but for most people you will know if you are doing it correct.  The mirror will help more to keep the form as you progress and start to lose form when you muscles are exhausted.

Each transform workout is completed 10 times.  If you stick to it, you will get amazing results that you will not see with an extreme intensity workout, running, or any other large-muscle group focused program (which most of them are).

It is fun, and at 30 minutes, it is quick too.  While you should do an additional 30 minutes of cardio, be it the dance cardio dvd or not, the transform dvd alone will suffice when you are truly in a bind for time.  I wish she had instructors and studios in my area, and maybe someday I will travel to do a live class, but this is the next best thing!  Look at her website and all the celebrities she has trained... watch the clip about the program, and you will see there is a difference in her method.

If you cannot commit to a program, yes, this is just going to sit in your pile/collection.  But if you really want to change your physique, whether you are a seasoned runner or new to exercising, this will get you where you want to go.",1361404800,480,3568,4.334841628959276
5462109,3,B00ANVZ8JE,Exercise made my muscles stiff the next day ( I had a good workout). My only complaint is that I which Tracy explained the exercise movements better. At some points needed more guidance regarding exercise movements.,1359504000,7,215,5.0
5462110,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"If you don't enjoy dancing, don't buy this. I like it much better without the music. I perform it while listening to an audio book.  I don't like dancing, but it is a REALLY good work out. I have never been more sore, and I noticed changes within the first week of the program.",1359331200,35,277,4.12962962962963
5462111,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"Okay, I've just purchased and watched Tracy's DVDs.  I am physically fit -- a runner who also does yoga -- and not overweight.  I thought that this program might provide a change from my usual routine.  Also, I enjoy dance (9 years of ballet lessons), and a dance fitness program appealed to me.

First, Tracy's program includes a diet that alternates weeks of so-called ""nutrition boosting,"" in which you eat the same 7-8 low-fat foods each day (boring, and very low calorie -- hence the alternate week plan), with weeks of so-called ""body resetting,"" which consists of a standard, low-fat, 2-meal, one nutrition bar daily regime.  I am a pescatarian -- I eat fish and veggies, but no meat or poultry - who eats no processed foods.  The diet seems to be basically healthy, in that, except for the nutrition bars (and that's an important exception), you are not eating processed foods and probably won't die of starvation. But it is no different from any other, healthy, low-fat diet.  You don't need Tracy for this.

Secondly, the ""cardiodance"" half hour, to be repeated each day, consists of Tracy jumping up and down,  kicking her legs out in several directions and waving her arms.  She suggests that you might depart from the demonstrated moves and try ""free form"" -- I suggest that you discard the DVD, put on some fast music, and shake your legs, behind and arms for half an hour.  You don't need Tracy for this one, either.

Thirdly, the ""Transform"" portion of the program, which consists of three DVDs to be performed consecutively over 90 days, is supposedly designed to exercise ""small muscles,"" and thereby mold your body anew.  I acknowledge that I am no physical fitness expert.  Yet these moves seem to be the same ones that I see in every exercise tape, or in classes at my gym, and are to my eyes no different from those that Jane Fonda was demonstrating in her fitness videos back in the eighties.  It's fine to follow Tracy's program; but you'll find similar programs all over the Internet, and for free.

I still have two payments to make on Metamorphosis, and suppose that I'm stuck.  Serves me right for falling for hype.  I will probably use ""Transform"" to exercise at those times when I can't  get to the gym and don't feel like a home yoga session.  I have to say, however, that I don't think that this program is worth the money -- it's expensive.  Basically, it's old wine in new bottles.",1356739200,257,2415,4.648584905660377
5462112,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I did this entire series and am now on month 5 of continuity.  I am a certified personal trainer and health a lifestyle coach.  This style of training is very unique and different from the current treads but it works.  There has yet to be a month that I haven't lost inches.  It has changed my 5'1"" body!",1507507200,7,304,4.189655172413793

5462114,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I have been turned off by Tracy Anderson for many years. She does not have the most approachable personality. However this program will get results.

After having my son I got down to my pre baby weight and got back to my previous fitness level. But I could not get my ab skin back to being tight. This workout system is helping me get there. I did Jillian Michael's workouts for years and while I can do a lot of push-ups, those just weren't working on my problem areas.

My advice is to get a beginner DVD before you do this to learn her techniques and reasoning. That is what I did. Tracy doesn't talk much and honestly it is OK. It will take a minute if you're used to other traditional workouts though.

I would also recommend skipping her cardio. Get other dance DVDs. Go for walks and hikes. Do kickboxing. I do 30 min/6x week and sometimes that just means pushing my kid for an hour in the stroller.

These workouts go by fast, and they are effective. You will be sore. Once you master the moves and sequences, consider putting your own music on and really focusing in on your accuracy and control of the movement. I would recommend slowing the movement down and having good form while hitting all the reps rather than going fast and skipping reps. You can always add ankle weights!

I would not recommend using heavier than a 3lb dumbbell.

If you follow this, you will see a tighter shape and cleaner lines in no time. Results come quickly.

I also want to debunk that this program isn't about NOT using major muscle groups but rather engaging even more muscles in addition to the major ones in a strategic way. And you will gain muscle and become firm. But it won't be in a bulky way like some other programs I have done.

Ok one last thing - Tracy does not account for diastisis recti in her videos. Don't do crunches if you just had a baby. My stomach is flat now and I didn't do traditional ab exercises until 6 months post partum. I focused on other ways to strengthen and cardio fitness. So make sure you listen to your own body and are aware of this because you don't want the fit mom pooch because you were too strenuous too soon.

Good luck!",1506470400,5,2160,4.3399503722084365
5462115,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"This set comes with two DVD's. The first is a 30 minute cardio DVD with a dance routine that you repeat every day for 90 days. The next is a 30 minute DVD with toning and strengthening exercise.  The 30 toning/strengthening workout seems to be effective, however there are a lot of repititions of the same exercise for a long period of time. It gets boring real fast.
The 30 minute dance cardio DVD on the other hand is beyond boring. If you want to pay $90 for a DVD to watch a woman dance around in random ways for 30 minutes, go for it. I would get the same workout essentially jumping in place for 30 minutes. It's not much different than that. Prepare for your calves to be rocked because it is literally 30 minutes of just jumping up and down. I can't imagine doing this every day for 90 days. I'm heading back to my treadmill for my cardio.",1506038400,,847,4.228395061728395
5462116,5,B00ANVZ8JE,So far so good. I got an email with links to the calendar and food plan right away! I printed those. I have been unable to follow 10 days in a row (even with the 1 day break) as I was so sore I had a hard time walking for 5 days after the first workout. I had to hit pause at least 15 times too. I am not in horrible shape but this workout is no joke. With that said it is a little joke being that it's weird and she looks like she's making stuff up as she goes. With that said I doubt I'll use the cardio and yes it's only for 3 months and then you will need something else. I find that If I make it 3 months that will be a welcome issue to have. It is a little boring at times and I have had some slight knee and a little more than slight right hip pain but I am listening to my body and waiting until I recover to move on. I used her videos before and It was the only system I saw actually arms toning and ab definition. I am 44 so take that as a guide I think someone late 50s might not be able to do. I haven't had any arm pain from this yet so I'm feeling like the other video was harder in the arms but I like that this isn't impossible. I watched almost all of the videos the rest of the way out and there seems to be a lot of plank type moves. I am excited to try those but I'm sure will be killer.,1504915200,,1307,3.6382978723404253

5462122,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"I primarily run and dance for my exercise routines, and found the Metamorphosis muscular structure DVDs helpful in building my endurance strength and balance for my activities in addition to trimming my body. While I also like the barre/pilates/ballet inspired workouts like P57, Core Fusion, and Cardio Barre, I find I'm more consistent using the Tracy Anderson DVDs because I move my legs in a wider range and different angles (i.e. move my legs into an arabesque or attitude positions). Her leg sequences are more interesting than the leg workouts done in the other barre workout DVDS. I also find her workouts are more portable when I need to workout outside my apartment; you just need a mat and 3 pound weights for around 30 minute, which I can find at any gym outside my apartment.
The reason I'm taking off a star is because I don't use the cardio disc very much because it's basically 30 minutes of jumping around, which I feel I could substitute by jump roping for that long. Like the what other reviewers have mentioned, Metamorphosis is not for beginners because TA provide minimal instruction. Beginners are better off picking up TA's Method for Beginners, the TA Mat Workout DVD, or pick up her book for explanations. However, if you are able to learn by watching, then you might be able to follow Metamorphosis without issue. I also don't follow her nutrition plan because I'm already under medical nutrition counseling, so I have my own eating plan anyway. Just clean up your diet, find an cardio activity that involves jumping as much as you're able to, and use the muscular structure DVDs. You'll basically capture the essence of Metamorphosis.",1491523200,5,1662,4.855633802816901

If you've never done TAM before I recommend doing her beginners DVDS first so you are not so lost and confused. This is a great program and works!!

I believe not every workout is for everyone but give this a try and don't give up on yourself before the miracle happens! I highly recommend this to someone who is ready to be commited to themselves and transformation in addition to have an open mind to try something new. Thanks Tracy!

5462132,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"Totally agree with another reviewer: Overworking large muscles causes breakdowns in knees, hips and shoulders, where these accessories are located. Body builders, runners, lifters, often injure their knees, hips, and shoulders for this very reason. They are tearing their accessory muscles.
-excellent point, considering most PT involves using the accessory muscles (through pilates and some other large range of motion and or small isolation work)  to help strengthen the overworked ones.

I have been using TAM and had the opportunity to work with Tracy in person for a few days and spent some one on one time. I am 5/4 and 120 lbs...I build muscles if I think about running, or benching large weights. I would do really well as a bodybuilder but ... I am dancer, TAM  has TOTALLY changed my body. I worked hard, super hard. But her method works. And TA is no joke, she works her ass off literally and get's results. Her workout does what she claims, period. if one doesn't want the TAM look or is going for something else, then by all means do something else.

5462133,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"UGH!  I have done tons of work out dvds - from PIYO with Chalene (great) to Brazilian Butt Lift with Leandro (great) to more people than I can name.  I switch it up and like to try new things so I finally thought I would try Tracy.  It gets two stars because some of her leg work is really good.  BUT really it's a one star because this is absolutely the most boring and awful workout I have ever done.  1) She offers NO advice on form, or how to do the exercises you simply are supposed to watch her and pick it up.  Who knows if you're holding your arms right, you just have to sort of see what the heck she's doing 2) She doesn't even COUNT - which is wonderful seeing as you're supposed to have your head down so as not to screw up your neck during the leg exercises but constantly have to look up to follow what she's doing.  My neck killed me after one week of this workout, constantly looking up don't even know when she changes the exercises so have to watch the stupid video like a hawk 3)The CARDIO is an absolute joke.  A bunch of jumping around - which not only is hard on your knees and rest of your body, but is basically no form, just jumping around - it's unbelievable to me that this is even called a cardio workout - just put some music on and jump around yourself you don't need the DVD 4) The diet is also an absolute joke, who has time to do that ridiculous diet - and after having a very clean diet myself over the years I have to say it doesn't even look healthy 5) I don't care if this workout gives results - it most likely wrecks your body - there's easier and better workouts out there that don't screw up your bod - so what if you're thin, your body is gonna pay for this.  I know one week of doing it and my knees wanted to scream for mercy - she would say I'm not hopping light enough on my toes, but that's a bunch of B.S.  it's incredibly hard on your body - high impact.  6)  Last but not least, you can't forward through the disclaimer - which I understand - but you also can't forward through the ten second ridiculous model shoot of her smiling into camera and spinning around.  So everytime you work out you have to watch her spin around and giggle into the camera for 10 seconds before you can move on.  HORRIBLE.",1465776000,5,2251,4.074829931972789

5462135,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I want to take advantage of this outlet to address the criticisms of the Tracy Anderson Method that I've read here and other places, some of which are valid, and some less so. She gets ripped on a lot, but usually by people who are pushing their political agenda and most of whom have not actually done her program, i.e. the hilarious feminist ""objection"" to her refusal to have women lift more than a small amount of weight, which Tracy is by no means alone in recommending when a specific goal is intended.
Common sense should make it obvious that some of Tracy's rhetoric is marketing, and each customer has the responsibility to define their goals, do their own research and/ or consult a medical professional before embarking on a fitness journey. It is each trainer's business model to assert that he or she is the end-all be-all of fitness. If you actually watch some of Tracy's interviews, however, she clearly and repeatedly states that your fitness goals are valid even if you don't want to look like a ballet dancer. Many women do, though, and we do not deserve to be shamed about it on the internet.
Another thing Tracy sometimes gets blasted on is her dietary guidelines. To be honest, she and her pal Gwynnie partly deserve it. They are not healthcare professionals and it is a dangerous abuse of their celebrity status to recommend food rules to anyone. But if you choose to follow their advice and get adverse effects, it's your own fault for not applying critical thinking. If you are already more or less are happy with your weight and have a healthy relationship with food (moderation), eat whatever makes you feel good and this program will do great things for you. If you need to lose a substantial amount of weight, go to a credible medical professional and have them layout a food plan that's fitted to you and will not throw you into a mental state of deprivation (very dangerous and bound to backfire).
Tracy talks a lot about targeting ""smaller muscles"" and gets criticized for not targeting large ones. First off, I'm no expert in anatomy... but if you've done the Glutecentric program, for instance, you know that your entire posterior is on fire at the end of that, so there's no way ANY muscles get left out.
If you have any sort of knee problems, do yourself a favor and find something else. I don't, but still ended up investing in knee pads that offer both cushioning and stability. The jumping in the cardio portion took some getting used to, and she does remind you several times to use momentum from arm movements to stay light on your feet. It took some practice, but as promised, it eventually became a lot of fun and completely manageable and invigorating, provided you get into it.
The last (completely valid) complaint that many customers have is that she does not offer enough cues. Personally, it is my favorite part about her...It takes 1-2 times for me to fully learn her workouts, and after that there's no need for all that chirping. 100% matter of preference. There may be a drawback to those who are new to certain types of fitness. I switched to Tracy after having plateaued on Mari Winsor's Pilates, which I did for years. Mari Winsor taught me that controlled movement is everything; both the key to maximizing results and avoiding injury. If you don't have the benefit of a yoga or Pilates background, keep in mind that while some of Tracy's movements may seem jerky and reliant on momentum, they are actually very strategic. You have to stay conscious and deliberate in each motion. Otherwise you're asking for sore joints and pulled muscles.
Tracy's unimpeachable contribution is that she offers a unbelievable amount of content of truly unique, innovative and effective moves. There is no comparison that I'm aware of. She won't let you get into a rut. I also love that she encourages that good selfishness which makes you feel obligated to show up for yourself and work hard to be your best possible version.

I don't use the cardio workout because it is way too high impact for my joints. I sometimes do a 15 minute cardio work out from her cardio for beginners, but usually don't. I don't follow her diet, though I do eat sensibly. And I have lost inches in just a few months.

The workouts themselves are great (I'm on the 4th one). I like that it's quiet. The workouts are challenging and I like to get in the zone without a lot of cheering from an instructor. It is really annoying that she doesn't cue you on the left side, (I think there is a musical cue if you can figure it out).  I just rewind the right side when I finish it so I don't have to even deal with trying to figure it out. Overall, I highly recommend TA method and like the Meta series.",1459209600,20,1191,4.1965065502183405

5462143,1,B00ANVZ8JE,"I did this workout and Tracy's continuity program for a year.  I started gaining weight, and having too many injuries, so I stopped and donated all of the DVDs to goodwill.  I now do ballet beautiful every other day and I have already started losing weight (3lbs this week) after a year of gaining.  Some thoughts on the workouts: Tracy's workouts are not good if you have any knee problems whatsoever.  The muscle work is done on all fours, and sometimes in plank ( brutal on your Achilles) and the dance cardio gave me stress fractures, extreme swelling of my knees and ankles, and weak muscles.  I injured my body instead of helping it.  THe jerky  throw-weights-around arm section caused too many muscle pulls....and the final straw was gaining weight.  Doing this workout daily was so stressful and injurious....I'm so glad that I stopped.  I now do Ballet Beautiful, my muscles are getting stronger, and I'm losing weight.  I'm also much happier.  I don't dread my workouts....they don't cause so much pain.  I will not do any of her workouts again.  I purchased my DVDs from Tracy Anderson online, and the continuity program was constantly back ordered or they ""couldn't charge my card"" (they had before) or they just cancelled my subscription without my permission.....no end of customer service problems.

5462145,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"I almost didn't buy this program because of all the negative reviews and then I thought I'll give it a go. Then once it arrived I started noticing all the things the negative reviewers were saying like she doesn't cue well and the dance cardio video is hard to follow and sucks. I started to feel like I didn't like Tracy or her way of teaching. Then I decided that I bought this program and I was going to look at it positively and not just feed into what others said. I do enjoy cueing but all in all it's not what gets you results. I also watched some videos of Tracy speaking and how she doesn't cue because she thinks it takes away from workouts and that's just not her style. I can dig it.

So after I got over my own negativity about it I started to really enjoy it. I love love love piyo, but I needed some new moves that had a similar vibe. I think her moves are hard, but unique and I know things are working in there. I lost 45lbs 6 years ago and try new things to keep it off. I've been doing this for at least 4-5 weeks now and I'm in love. My trouble areas are starting to pull in in all the right places where as almost all other workouts in the past never did that other than piyo. I think her cardio is hard to follow, but I took others' advice and just had fun with it and eventually you start to get the moves. I rarely write reviews, but I thought it was necessary for others to know while this workout has some flaws and isn't perfect, it's still got great moves that work. It also gives me the lesson at not listening to what all the negative nancies say because let's face it they're always going to find something negative to say about things.",1455580800,9,1667,4.0823170731707314

I did the diet, the exercises...I could not do the cardio.  Way too hard on my knees and low back (and I'm in shape - I go to a gym and do yoga).  Instead, I followed her cardio routine for the treadmill, doing 30 min, which was pretty intense.  I have to say, I got nothing out of this.  3 months into it, I was flabby, no tone, no anything. I looked great before I started it, by the way.  Using 3 lb weights did nothing for me.  And the routines are tortuously boring, so I was miserable as well.  I was back at ground zero, and had to go to the gym again, which took several more months for me to get looking decent again. So, all in all, I looked like crap - over the summer months, and couldn't put on a bathing suit.  I kept thinking it would get better if I just stuck with it, because she kept saying in the videos that I should be noticing differences.  I even forgave the fact that she didn't count out the reps for you, or give you a heads up when changing positions.  And she even messed up on a few, doing a different positioning with her hands on the left side as opposed to the right.  I didn't even try to sell this.

5462158,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I am only on day 4 of this program, but I'm already seeing major changes in my body and couldn't wait to post a review. I've done other workout DVDs from Tracy in the past, and I absolutely love her method. My body responds to it, and it provides instant gratification -- both in physique and in method improvement from day to day.

I did make a few modifications to ensure I stick with it. First of all, I knew I would never stick with the program if I followed her meal plan. I don't handle hunger well, and I've already discovered diets that work for me, so I chose to stick to those. I cut out all beverages other than water and the occasional black coffee, and I drink a green smoothie for breakfast and for dinner. All lunches are low carb (below 30 grams). I sometimes add PB2 to my smoothie to get more flavor and excitement.

I also mute the DVDs and listen to my own music. The music she plays is awful and so not motivating. I freestyle the cardio section and just have fun dancing. I follow along with her moves when possible, but she's hard to keep up with so early in the program.

Again, I'm only 4 days in, but so far I love it! I've already lost 4 pounds, I've noticed considerably tighter skin, and I'm finding myself eating far less than I used to, while still enjoying my food.

I highly recommend this to anyone interested in fast, life changing results!",1432339200,7,1375,4.276923076923077
5462159,1,B00ANVZ8JE,Didn't even make it through the first session. No instruction whatsoever. Jumped from one move to another without even a cue. Not for beginners! I am very dissapointed. She looks mad in most of the video. Put it in the garage sale pile.,1432166400,4,236,4.511627906976744
5462160,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"You know what I love about Tracy? She doesnt BS you. She tells you right away that it is not going to be easy that, in fact, its going to be really hard. Because thats how bodies work: they resist change. I am so tired of trainers telling me how easy it will be to transform my body. Lies! If it was easy, everyone in the world would be in great shape and super skinny.

Despite how easy it is to walk off the weight (or whatever tripe they are selling these days), I have been carrying about 15 extra pounds for my entire adult life. I tried everything and could not lose it. I eventually gained another 15 pounds and realized that I needed to make serious changes. I started running 4 miles a day. I mastered the legendary Buns of Steel video (with the magnificent Greg Smithy). I counted every last calorie that passed over my lips. And I didn't drop a pound.

Enter Tracy. Her moves are changing my body. I am on level 9 and I have lost 20 pounds (!) and I continue to lose. I was in pretty good cardio shape when I started but I could not get through the cardio portion without taking a few breaks. If you are serious about losing weight and are ready to put in the work, then get this program. My only regret is that I did not start it years ago.

That said, all of the negative ones on here almost discouraged me from getting the set! So, I wanted to respond to some of the criticisms. First and most importantly, I do not think this program is for beginners. As I said above, I was already in pretty good shape when I started and I STRUGGLED with it. If you are just starting out with a fitness program, I would recommend staring with some of her beginner videos and working your way up.

And yes, the cardio is 30 minutes of jumping and free-styling. It is still one of the most intense cardio workouts I have ever done. It absolutely looks silly. But don't let that discourage you! Listen to your own music and get some shoes with a lot of arch support (or some shoe inserts). After I got the hang of the moves, I started have a lot of fun with it.

I did not follow the diet, so I cannot speak to that. I looked over it when I got the program, and it does look intense. Its my impression that Tracy does not intend for the emphasis to be on restricting calorie intake rather the diet is designed to eliminate unhealthy foods and reset your system to not crave junk. I don't think you need to follow it to get results, but if you want to lose weight you do have to choose some kind of diet. Weight loss really is 80% about what/how much you eat, so adopting some kind of restricted diet is extremely important.

In all, if you are serious about changing your body and are ready to put in the work, then get this program. Dont be discouraged by some of the bad reviews on here (many of those reviewers never even made it past level 1!). If you put in the work, this program will give you results.",1431993600,34,2905,4.160142348754448
5462161,3,B00ANVZ8JE,"This program is a 90 day program, with cardio dance 30 min workout (to be done 6 days a week), a muscular toning program (a new workout every 10 days so you don't get bored) and a diet plan.

Pros:
It's nice to have everything laid out for you so you don't have to think about it.
The diet plan is easy to follow and doesn't require heaps of ingredients like a lot of other programs.
The workouts have a great option whereby you can silence the music and have just Tracy talk (or the other way around) so you can put your own music on.
The dance cardio is fun and not complicated and though Tracy recommends that you do this by yourself, I found it fun to do it with the kids.
The muscular work seems simple when you watch it but some muscles you didn't know you had will make you hurt the next morning... And it happens every 10 days with the new workouts.

Cons:
Firstly, my kids are small, I wish that on the DVD cover, she would wear more clothes. Anyway...

Diet - I have to admit that though I felt cleaner and I did lose weight, I am constantly hungry. It took all of my will power to not eat anything else she prescribed. It did make me grumpy... But I did have more energy! Weird.
Dance cardio - there is so much jumping that my knees suffered. I had to stop after 10 days of jumping and walk instead.
Muscular workout - I have nothing bad to say about these, only that I wish I had more time and that they were longer. They reshaped my legs after 5 days and my body felt stronger after a week.

5462164,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I absolutely love Tracy Anderson. I have her Method for beginners, Mat Work for beginners, Precision Toning, and her book in addition to my newly purchased Hipcentric tape.

Tips:
-I strongly advise buying any of her beginners tapes before you try to do Metamorphosis, she explains things in detail in them, where she does not in hipcentric, so if you have an idea of what you should be doing, the tape will be easier to follow. A lot of her moves are similar between the tapes, but the way she puts them together is different.
-With the dance cardio, don't be worried if you can't keep up with her the first few times. She does all of her moves with NO explanation. But I find that if I can't figure out what she is doing, I just do moves that I do know. I don't think that it is about doing EVERY move she does, but just keep moving. I have been working out on an eliptical and stationary bike, and I find that I am infinitely more exhausted after doing the dance cardio for less time than I do on either of the others. I am incredibly uncoordinated, and still had a blast.
-Be prepared to get your butt kicked with this tape. The last part of the workout is muscle exhaustion (while on all fours) and I could barely keep up with here/make it to the end, and my legs felt like jello once I was finished. Stretch good before and after!

This set does not include the anything but the four discs, but you get an email with PDFs with Meal Plan, Grocery List and Workout Calendar.",1426464000,13,1478,4.275
5462165,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"This review is for the complete boxed set (instead of just DVDs, as this specific Amazon listing is for). I purchased the Omnicentric boxed set at a big box retailer for $40. I reviewed most of the workouts via YouTube, and decided to purchase. I am currently at 4 weeks, and very happy with the results so far. Here's the breakdown:

*Documentation/Tape Measure: the complete boxed set includes a Welcome Message, Program Tips, Workout Tracker Chart, Dynamic Eating Plan, and tape measure. I personally feel that you're not losing out on much by receiving just the DVDs. The Dance Cardio DVD includes a Welcome Message that pretty much summarizes the Program Tips, the Workout Tracker Chart is simply a check-off chart of where you are in the progressive 90-day program (I just kept a tally on a Post-It note), and the tape measure is...a tape measure, if you need to measure yourself - I personally find it more satisfying to feel the difference in how my clothes fit. I asked my neighbor, who is a RDN (registered dietician nutritionist) who confirmed that the meal plan seemed too low calorie for me - I'm 5'3"", 115-120lbs, exercise regularly, with a pretty active lifestyle chasing after two elementary school aged kids. My focus was on reshaping and toning - not losing weight - so I stick to my usual healthy eating habits. I really don't want to be a super cranky hangry mom :p

*Dance Cardio DVD: this is NOT a beginner cardio exercise. It is 30 solid minutes of fast-paced, hopping around, without much verbal cueing or transition breaks. I'm pretty fit and can handle an intermediate dance cardio hour...but this one exhausts me, as there is no break in intensity for the entire duration. I do still do it every few days, but I have been switching it up with other cardio (hour of Zumba, Tracy Anderson Dance Cardio DVs, elliptical), to give my ankles and calves a break. I do like her other Dance Cardio DVDs, there is better instruction and cueing, good cardio exercises. If you are a person who needs to do as the instructor does, this DVD may be frustrating - as other reviews have said, there is quite a bit of freestyling here...I'd say 10% of the time, she does not do the same thing on both sides. I still like it as it taught me the moves I need to be doing per her method, and the pace at which I should be doing them. Now I pretty much freestyle to my own music, with the DVD on mute to cue myself on the pace I should be keeping, and focus on accuracy and intensity of the moves.

*Muscular Structure DVDs: Good stuff. You get a new 30-min workout every 10 days/workouts.  After the first few days of each workout, I was more familiar with the routine, and focused on accuracy (angles, pace, follow through) and engaging the parts as cued, checking in the mirror. I think this is the stuff that makes her so popular, it really does work if you do it right. I saw results in my arms and thighs/tush in the first week! I feel tight and springy in areas I've never really noticed before. A lot of it is mat work on hands and knees - if you're not used to this, you may feel it in your wrists and shoulders, just as you would if you just started yoga, etc.

I am seeing results as promised. I usually average 4 days in a row; some days I am only able to find time for the Muscular Structure work, but try to make up for it by doing an hour of Cardio the next day - so not doing the 6 days in a row as suggested but still seeing nice results, yay. Plus she is so cute to watch, what an amazing tiny bundle of lean muscle she is :)

Taking away a star because - and this is going to sound snobby but I'm in marketing so I can't help but notice - this set seems a bit thrown together. The list of what is included on the outside of the box differs from what is listed on the documentation (mine only mentions the tape measure on the documentation, and did NOT include the tape measure). The set feels as though it assumes you know your abilities, dietary needs, limits. Works for me, but as it's being marketed for anyone and everyone, it does concern me that there is very little handholding beyond the federally mandated scrolling warning at the beginning of the DVDs. There really are no warm ups, cool downs, reminders to hydrate. The muscle structure stuff is gold and it works - but if you're new to working out and plan to drop significant weight via the meal plan, please take care.

I thought about taking away another star because I contacted customer service about two things: the missing tape measure and the inability to access the special website section mentioned in the documentation - I received a cut-and-paste answer that the website is being revamped ""for the near future,"" and no response to the missing tape measure. Now I really don't need the tape measure, but I was looking forward to accessing the site. Oh well, the DVDs still deliver.",1425600000,10,4878,4.431438127090301

5462178,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"I didn't give it 5 stars due to some of the tricky to follow instructions. I still give it a 4 star because it works and it's worth sticking to.
Her program help my problem with sciatica and pretty much gave me the tools to the maintenance when I get a hint that it may be coming back. The one thing in her program that I did not do was the dance cardio. It was a little sporadic for me and I have a dance background. I can see what she is trying to accomplish but I choose to not do that DVD and did my own cardio regimen.
I may have had some more dramatic results if I tried to do her cardio, but I was still very pleased with the toning and strength I got from just doing the rest of the DVD's. When you are just not into a full hour or so of work out, popping in a 30 minute work out in this regimen was perfect! You will sweat and feel energized just after 30 minutes. Even if that is all you can do for the day, it's worth it.
It's nice to just follow along and not have to think about what's next. I wish there was a count given, and the music is a little weird.
She does not cue you on things so there will be times of awkward movements and not being able to keep in time.
There is a method going here and I was really pleased even though it's not straight forward.
It's worth giving it a go. Especially if you happen to sit a lot and develop problems with a sciatic nerve. At least it really helped me. Going in for round 2",1421539200,7,1432,3.857627118644068

The dance DvD (which should be done before each actual workout, lasting about 30 minutes) is fun.  It reminds me of Zumba where there is minimal talking or cues to the next move.  There is a lot of light jumping and bouncing around because she says lifting your own body weight is the key to a good workout.  The other DvDs each have an arm and ab workout and then you move into the floor work (lasting about 30 minutes).  I was surprised to see such amazing results with the arm routines because the highest weight you use is 3 pounds.  It really does work, though!  For the floor work, the angles she uses are challenging and it's sometimes difficult to complete all the reps, however, it is the most effective workout I've ever tried.  I've developed muscles that have been previously challenging to develop and it really does pull your body in tight from the inside out.  I love that she doesn't fill the time with annoying chit-chat but instead, allows you to focus on the movements so that you receive the best workout.  It is done on a mat on the floor and usually on all fours. I initially thought this would be a problem for my bad knee but I have found that if I use a small pillow under my knee for support that it is not an issue at all.  I plan on buying more of her DvD programs in the future and I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking to slim down their hips and lift the toosh.

Tracy also lacks motivation. She hardly talks during the workout so you easily get bored. It is also extremely repetitive.

5462199,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"First off, let me say this: this is NOT a beginner's workout. The daily cardio will kick your butt if you're not in shape, and the muscular structure programs are extremely tricky at first. But, that being said, it's difficult because it's tough and tough is GOOD.

I have been a runner for 12 years now. I am 25, 5'7 and 155 pounds (around a size 9-10) and have pretty much plateaued on my body shape and weight; I needed something more. I am on day 20 and have already seen crazy results: my body shape is actually changing. My runner's thighs are slimming down (the curvature and ""saddle bags"" are disappearing), my butt (which was quite big and muscular) is perkier than a stripper's and looks smaller! My arms are also slimming and I am noticing that my waist seems to look longer. I don't weight myself, but all of my jeans are looser than they were 20 days ago, and most of my friends have commented that I look thinner.

I am surprised at some of the comments I am reading. I am seeing a lot of ""too hard,"" ""sore knees and ankles,"" and ""the dance routine sucks,"" or ""the music is terrible!"" This program really isn't about the music... or the dance routine. It's really about connecting to your body through intense movement and pushing it in news ways, to really grow and foster an appreciation.

If you're sore, buy some braces and fitness tape. I look like I am a robot (and kind of feel like I am in sausage) with the amount of tape, braces and spandex that I need to wear for this workout. Also, I am sore in places that I didn't even know existed; but it's awesome! In regards to the music, she gives the option of no music. Put your iPod on or plug in your iPod to some speakers. I put on a Latin Dance mix and pretend I am JLo. DO NOT let the music or the fact that you ""can't dance"" be the reason you do not do this. You can jump, and shake your hips. No one is saying you have to look good doing it. In face, Tracy Anderson is probably the ONLY one who looks good doing it.

Bottom line: if you want to feel kick-ass sexy, like you're the fitness queen of the world... while never leaving the comforts of your own home.. DO THIS! Rock it! Put on a playlist of all of your favorite dance songs and rock the hell out of cardio. If you have to laugh the entire time you're doing the muscular structure, or swear at her, do it. This is about you becoming fit and getting out of your routine workout. It's definitely an addictive program and already I feel like I am making a life-style change.

Make it work for you, the energy you put it will definitely match with your results. I am a slave to Tracy for now and forever.. I don't even miss running!",1405468800,57,2664,4.215686274509804

I liked it but didn't do it consistently, it was really hard for someone so out of shape.

I just finished day 75 of the Hipcentric Meta and I've lost 15 pounds and 19 inches!!! It definitely works if you are consistent, I can count on one hand the number of days I've missed.

I don't do the dance cardio or the diet so you definitely can get results without those. I took one look at the diet and laughed it's bogus!

I just do supplemental cardio videos I find on demand on my tv, take long walks with baby and try to do some sort of cardio every day to make me sweat a little!

Finally a workout that actually gives me the cuts I want & the lean muscle all over. I am into year 2 of metamorphosis & can't imagine going back to the standard workout DVDs alone. Since the routines constantly change I am never on auto pilot or unengaged.

I find it ridiculous that people actually posted negative reviews of this program after one workout or after just watching a few & thought they were just the same moves they've seen before.....seriously??? You should at least attempt the workouts for a while before reviewing it. Sure there are annoying aspects to the DVDs, but I find that true of a lot of workouts.

5462213,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"Ok.  I HAVE to address some of the criticisms of this set.  I almost didn't buy this because some of the people here were SO critical (It does seem to be a love/hate relationship with her).  I found it at Bed Bath and Beyond on sale for $60, used a 20% coupon and walked away with the whole set for less than $50.  I have been at it for 2 months.

I am 44 years old, a stay-home-mom to three boys (so the gym is not in the budget or on the schedule).  I am in ok shape.  Although I have exercised moderately and worked on my diet my whole life, consistency has not been my strong suit.  I am 5'3 and weigh about 125 lbs.  The cellulite has been settling in over the last couple years as I have become less active (due to the boys being bigger and able to do a lot more on their own.  My arms went to hell-in-a-hand basket when I stopped lifting toddlers to reach things or get to places faster!)  My diet is very clean, comparatively, than it has been in the past or with other Americans.  I have worked on this steadily for years.  YOUR DIET - WHAT YOU PUT IN YOUR MOUTH - ACCOUNTS FOR 80% OF WHAT YOUR BODY LOOKS/FEELS LIKE.  If you have not mastered your diet.  STOP.  Go back.  My suggestion is to take a year or two to work only on this.  Do moderate exercise while you work on this all-important life-style change.  The effort involved while you work on changing your taste buds from enjoying greasy, bad food to actually enjoying vegetables, fruits, clean grains and proteins is IMMENSE.  Go easy on yourself.  Love yourself while you make mistakes with it.

#1:  The Dynamic Eating Plan  --  Well.  There are a couple issues.  While I commend her for the excellent food choices (fruit, veggies, low fat proteins), she is a bit irresponsible with certain aspects.  For example, during a Body Reset week, she has a person eating only 750 calories a day!!!  This in NOT, repeat, NOT ok.  DO NOT try to eat less than 1200 calories a day!  ESPECIALLY if you are exercising an hour a day.  She is very nave about this.  She deals with movie stars fitting into Academy Award gowns.  This is not realistic or safe.  Please don't do this.  Her naivete is further evidenced by statements like ""if you are allergic to chestnuts, just substitute them with berries"".  These are not nutritional equivalents and I am not sure what she is thinking.  Use the eating plan for examples of good food to eat.  And eat a lot of it.  YOU MUST increase your intake of this type of good food in order to have the energy to do the work out.  (If you are not there yet, go back.)  DO NOT under any circumstances load your diet up with ""light drinks"" , or ""low calorie vitamin waters"" or Kashi (CRAZY!!!!) bars.  These are garbage loaded with artificial sweeteners, gmo's and additives that will make you feel like garbage.  Because they are garbage.  This poor girl needs a nutrition 101 class.  Oh well.  Also it is ok to lower your carb intake dramatically, and make it more like quinoa or sprouted grain breads - like Ezekial Bread.  But I wouldn't eliminate them altogether as she seems to suggest.  Your body will need carbs to complete proteins present in vegetables and to have the energy needed to burn for exercise.  LEARN ABOUT NUTRITION FIRST.  There is a ton of great information out there.  Her ""diet"" plan should NOT be your resource for this.

#2 Yes -- the cardio routine is a bit silly.  BUT.  Listen a few times to what she talks about during the routine and why she chooses the moves she does, the reasons for them.  My legs always get HUGE from step routines, or running, or ""circuit"" training or even walking.  I have always hated it.  She tells you why this happens and why it is so vital to do the types of moves she does.  Once you learn what she is talking about, you can turn the whole thing off, make a 30 minute playlist of dance music and freestyle the whole thing.  It is FUN and I now look forward to cardio, knowing my thighs aren't blowing up, but actually slimming and my butt is lifting.  PS:  If you already have a cardio routine such as jogging that you already know works well for you and your body, don't do this one.  Also, it has taken me 2 months! to get anywhere near the level of cardio she is at.  I am still pushing my system to do the whole 30 minutes.  I slow down often, still.  But I keep moving as much like her as I possibly can.  If I don't push a ton of good foods and water, I totally bonk.

#3  The Transform.  And here why you NEED TO BUY THIS.  The reviewer who ""watched"" the set before letting us all know she wasted her money is a bit of a ninny.  (Yes I just used that word, lol)  These are not your typical ""Jane Fonda"" Movements.  Not by a longshot, honey.  I have been doing exercise videos and classes since Jane Fonda was popular (yes, I even had one when I was 14).  This is DIFFERENT.  These moves CHANGE YOUR LEGS.  They work on the accessory muscles (which Jane Fonda didn't even know existed - she just starved herself and toned a couple large muscle groups, by her own admission).  They pull you from the inside out.  You will wake up sore in places deep within your legs, places you didn't know existed.  This is GENIUS.  why?  A).Because when we build these small muscles, we  take the stress off our skeletal system (building large muscles without building these accessories, weakens the accessories and taxes our skeletal system.  Overworking large muscles causes breakdowns in knees, hips and shoulders, where these accessories are located.  Body builders, runners, lifters, often injure their knees, hips, and shoulders for this very reason.  They are tearing their accessory muscles.)
B)  These small, accessory muscles require FEWER CALORIES to sustain them.  You can eat minimally and remain strong.  Why is that good?  Well fewer calories means fewer chances in a day to make a bad choice about what we put in our mouth.  Large Muscle groups require tons of protein to maintain.  You start putting crap like protein powders into your veggie smoothie.  This is disgusting and BAD FOR YOU.  Needing more calories means wanting to ""stop"" while you're on the road for food.  And we all know what this means.  Giant Muscles are High Maintenance and cause very bad habits.  We all  know how easily that large muscles turn to fat.
C)  This one is just my opinion but I have always thought that Large Muscle Groups look like crap on a woman.  Our bodies were designed to look longer and leaner than a man's who historically has had to use large muscle groups for lifting, etc.  I don't think large muscles are beneficial to either men or women due to the two reasons cited above (my husband has large muscles and his joints are breaking, not to mention he can put away 3000 calories a day without gaining.  This is fine until he eats an entire ice cream carton in one sitting and then feels like crap for two days).  But for women, this just seems especially true......I don't know why.  Maybe because we are just supposed to be smarter than that.

Final notes -- I don't do this 6 times a week.  (Good Lord Tracy!).  I shoot for 4-5 times a week,  sometimes even 3,  letting my body rest for a day after I have pushed it especially hard, letting these small muscles rest and rebuild.  I have never, ever,  in two months, been able to complete all the Transform reps on the legs.  But it is a goal.  Go easy on yourself, LOVE yourself.  I am and it IS WORKING!!!!!  I will report back after a couple more months.....I did use her tape measure.  And I have lost a half to a whole inch or so in each area. (I don't have a scale.  But I know my body well enough to know when I take in fewer calories and burn more, I lose weight.)  I put a calorie counter on my smart phone.  You would be shocked at how quick 1200 calories gets eaten up.  Even with healthy food!!  Forget crap food - you can't eat hardly any before you reach 1200 calories and you feel like crap.  I bought a ninja to make vegetable smoothies.  I can't sit and eat whole fruits and vegetables.  But grind it up into a smoothie and I can put away five servings like that!  Good Luck.",1395964800,402,8102,4.360887096774194
5462214,3,B00ANVZ8JE,"I'm a big girl, but I am great at working out when I want to. Before attempting a new workout, however, I try to watch the video first to prepare myself for what is in store for me. I sat down one day and watched the first disc of this workout. I do think it is a good workout, and maybe something I'll be able to do someday, but I don't think I'm ready just yet and I'll tell you why...

She works one part of your body over and over and over again before moving on to another part of your body. My arms get tired and burn just brushing my hair. There is literally no way I could do, like, 10 minutes straight of keeping my arms raised and working them.

The workouts I find most effective work each body part for a couple minutes, then move on to another body part, and eventually work back to the first, etc... it gives each muscle group a chance to rest before continuing, without stopping the workout entirely. My favorite workout of all time is the original Billy Blank's Tae Bo. He is fantastic at working the muscle groups in shifts.

So, as I said, I do think this is probably a good workout, and something I will be able to do someday. I'm not sorry I bought it. But if you're like me, and have trouble with your muscles tiring out too early, I think this workout will prove too strenuous until you're in a bit better shape already.",1395705600,8,1342,4.153846153846154

This disc set is unlike any routine I every tried before.  Really read the reviews before buying the set.  I am 11 days into the set determine to complete it even though I HATE IT and you should not hate a exercise routine because you will eventually give up on it.  Pros:  The exercises or very easy and not hard on the joints, it last only 30 minutes but that's it.  Cons:  She barely instructs you on the entire routine.  She doesn't tell you how many reps to do of each exercise so you eyes have to be constantly glued to the TV which intern has given me a sore neck especially when your doing floor exercise and she does not tell you when she is going to switch an exercise so you end up loosing reps to catch up.  Some reps or 4, 6, and 47.  YES I said 47.  I think she calls it the floor frequent muscle exhaustion sequence each exercise is about 47 to 50 reps it's hard to count because I am always trying to watch the screen for when she switches.  This (FFMES) last for about 15 minutes of the entire routine THANK GOD.  The disc set also comes with a every day Dance Cardio disc which is just a lot of  jumping around moving your feet and legs and arms different ways it last for about I think 30 minutes but I have yet to complete it because she doesn't tell you when she switches exercises so I end up getting bored because I feel like I'm just jumping around and end up turn it off.  Any exercise that you have 47 reps for is just plan D BORING.  So if you want to have fun doing exercise and still loosing weight this is not the set for you.",1395273600,9,1757,4.108504398826979

5462221,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"I have never written a review on anything but after seeing some people give this workout a 4 or 5 rating; I MUST!

Firstly, I am not going to dispute if the exercises work because if you move your body and eat well the weight loss is inevitable. However, fitness professionals have a responsibility to offer products that work for AT HOME USE!

There are 2 parts to this program: dance/cardio and the arms/abs/legs segments.

This chick gives 0 (zero) instruction or break down of moves that you have NEVER done before. She barely talks at all. However, when she does talk, it is to tell us how important it is to follow her moves. HOW LADY? The music is so corny and the moves are so strange that I have long given up on anything that she calls dancing. WEIRD WEIRD WEIRD!

The moves in the arm/abs section can easily resemble a seizure fit and her lack of instruction only exacerbates the situation.

The leg section is challenging but doable and understandable. However, it is extremely difficult to maintain your momentum and proper form while having to count yourself and constantly look at the TV for your next move. As a matter of fact, I have given up on every portion of the series except for the leg section. I used the voice recorder on my IPhone to count out the leg reps (and play it back each time) so that I can have some semblance of a decent workout.

I use other workouts (Turbo Jam, Zumba, Hot Hula Fitness, Leslie S, etc) to fulfill my desired effect.

I read some reviews that suggest Tracy's lack of cueing and instruction is no big deal but I beg to differ. There is a specific obligation that comes with producing an at home product. We don't have the benefit of any face to face interaction; therefore, it is more important than ever to create an easy to understand and approachable program for the purchaser/user. Needless to say, she missed the mark! BTW, after she has turned your legs to mush, she doesn't even offer a proper stretch or cool down!!!!!!! Who does that? WE ALL SPENT HARD EARNED MONEY! When is the last time you took a class or used an at home workout without a stretch/cool down? Give me a break!

I like workouts where it appears the instructor has personality and Tracy (IMHO) appears aloof and unapproachable. She got 2 stars because with MY modifications the leg section works.",1393804800,19,2326,4.521428571428571
5462222,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"First of all, I have to say I would have given this workout program five stars, but since I've made modifications to it I figured I shouldn't it go for the full five stars.

My advice to people on this workout is to know what you are getting yourself into before buying it.  I bought this workout full aware of at least two things: 1.) The food program is ridiculous and 2.) Tracy does a bad job of cueing.  But since none of my other workouts were doing what I wanted (and my food habits weren't working), I decided to give this one a shot.  I am 42 years old and have tried a lot of different workouts but this one has definitely yielded me different results (and my husband notices the results too).  I've been doing this workout for a little over a month and have lost 8 pounds and several inches from my hips, thighs, and stomach.  I have not been sticking to the regimen as strictly as I should be or I probably would be further ahead, but I'm OK with that.

First off, the food program: After spending most of my Sunday securing the foods for the first week, I spent another 3 hours preparing the food for the following week.  I tried to make as much of my food in bulk as I could, but it only lasted me for four days.  After the food ran out, I couldn't bring myself to spend another three hours making up all the food.  I will say, that I wasn't starving and the calorie count (according to MyFitnessPal) was above my recommended 1,200 calorie intake for the day.  So I wouldn't call it dangerous in any way for me.  Would I do it again?  YES.  The main thing that happened for me was that it got rid of my sugar and carb addiction, which was something I never realized I had become so reliant on.  Also, I gave up diet soda over it too (which now that I've researched it more, is horrible for anybody trying to control their weight) and cut back significantly on dairy.  I have a little bit of cheese here and there, but I've replaced my milk with almond milk and have never looked back.  Because of the diet changes, my husband (who isn't even doing a regimented workout plan) has lost almost 25 pounds in the past six weeks.  I attribute all of this to Tracy's food program or I would have continued to eat yogurt, granola bars, and diet soda, only to continue to never losing any weight.

For the workouts, I have to say the dance cardio that came with the DVD set is not for me.  I tried it for a week or so, and even tried using my own playlists to make it fun for me.  After about the seventh workout, my knee (which I injured running a couple of years ago) became so painful from all of the jumping around that I quit doing the dance cardio altogether and have been focusing on the muscle structure workouts.  Just lately, I've discovered another Tracy Anderson beginner's dance cardio workout that I bought off Amazon and I LOVE it!  She goes through each move and I think after I do this one for several weeks, I might be ready for the one that came with the DVD.  The muscle structure workouts are the ones that will really give you the huge payoff.  I am shedding inches like never before and sculpting in areas I've never been sculpted.  I will say that it is WAY easier playing the DVD on a laptop computer that you can put on the floor with you.  You don't have to crane your neck to see the TV screen to see what she's doing.  Also, on the computer it is way easier to just skip back to the beginning of the right leg when it's time to workout your left side.  Tracy only gives cueing on the right leg.

I'm currently on week three, day one of the muscle structure series.  I have not been able to workout continuously for six days straight as shown on Tracy's workout tracker, but I'm still seeing results that I'm very pleased with.  I had purchased the Jillian Michael's Body Revolution set back in 2012 and couldn't hardly get out of the week one exercises because the workouts would stress my knee too much.  I would always give up before I could get fully into week two, then I would try to pick up week one again only to have it bother my knee.  It was a never-ending cycle.  This is one workout series that I can see myself sticking with through the whole program.",1393027200,34,4197,4.236477987421384

Tracy makes these workouts fun and up beat while challenging you. Yes, she's not good at cueing but neither is Zumba. You do the same workout for 10 days, you will learn it! And by no means are these workouts whimpy, my husband does P90x and he joined me one time and was winded and even sore in the abs.
I am 5'8 and 150 lbs. I've lost only a couple of pounds and lost an inch off of everywhere. I'm on day 42 but that doesn't mean I don't think it is working.

5462226,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"Oh, wow! So not going to repeat what everyone else is saying about instructions or the craziness of the ""dance"" dvd, or all the other minuscule issues many people are having...what I will say is I love this workout! I am a very athletic person who loves to sweat and feel the burn...I did cross country and triathlons throughout high school and college and then continued to workout at least 6 days each week. Then life happened, I got pregnant and I wasn't able to work out like I used to...once I had my little dude and I was able to workout again, I no longer had the drive to do what I was doing before. My workouts were barely doing anything for me. Then I finally decided to give TAM workout a try, despite some of the negative reviews. I just finished the 1st DVD (3 different workouts over 30 days) and I still have 2 dvds (the rest of the 90 day program) and I have to say I am really loving this workout!

If you like to sweat, if you like to move, if you like to feel that you actually did something, then you should give this a go! The dance DVD reminds me of doing jump rope for 30 minutes straight, b/c you really are jumping for the most part and doing various leg and arm moves...it took me at least 5-6 days to do the ""dance"" without having to stop and rewind it b/c I messed up. But I still miss a step here and there, but I think that is good...my mind is involved in the workout vs being on a machine and going through the motions.

I have lost inches already, and while I am eating better, I am not one to follow a diet. While I am not following the diet, I am more cognizant of what I am putting in my mouth and how much. My butt is higher and my abs are back!! (this really got me excited since I haven't seen my abs since giving birth!!) This workout also got me in enough shape that I can start running again, which I have not done in over a year!! So, thank you Tracy!

If you don't like to sweat, if you have really bad knees, or you care too much about what you look like when you are ""dancing"" then this isn't the workout for you. However, if you love to sweat and enjoy having fun then I think you would really enjoy this...I am looking forward to getting the continuity when I complete this first series.

I am a TAM fan! Oh, and I purchased mine at Bed, Bath and Beyond for under $70...just an FYI. I think her website retails for about $85 or $90.",1392249600,8,2380,4.068230277185501

I called that dvd a loss and do the 30 minutes of cardio on my elliptical. The transformation dvds are a tiny bit more easier to follow but it is so boring.  You are doing the same move for a long time and what few words she says in her monotone voice are not encouraging at all.  I can definitely feel it working and my muscles burn but there is no way I can put up with it on a daily basis.

My problem is that I get bored of the same workout after a few months so I move on.

With that said, this method is not for people that appreciate structure. While I am sure there is a reason for the method she teaches, it makes absolutely no sense to the structured mind. She does little to no explaining of the movements throughout the workout and just gets worse as you go through it. You spend more time trying to figure out what's happening rather than working out.

I had to keep watching the screen to see what she was doing.  ( I would have liked to have seen Gwyneth doing it.  I wonder if she was as frustrated as I am.)

I previously bought a couple of her older DVDs and was fairly happy with them and decided to spend the cash for this - thinking newer is better and improved upon technically speaking. The older cardio DVD was a little corny and unpredictable so I especially expected her to improve upon this. I'm not terribly disappointed with the muscular structure workouts (so far) but the cardio is no easier to follow and the continuous jumping is insane and dangerous for many, many people, fit or not.  Sure, its great for the heart and calorie burn but not at the price of ruining knees.  I know she's trying to keep the choreography simple for non dancers but I believe she is not creative and failed at making it ""easy"".  A dancer looks for a certain predictable, logical pattern so I was crazy frustrated.  Maybe it is easier for a non dancer but I doubt it.

5462237,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"I was determined to use these DVDs.  I saw Gwyneth's behind in that see-through dress and I'd like mine to look like that too!
I did the routine everyday for about 12 days.  I thought the exercises seemed like they would tone and I definitely could ""feel it"" after the first couple days.  I liked that the whole routine was not very long and that I could do it at home.  But, finally I just gave up, because I was so frustrated by the lack of instruction when trying to follow the exercises.  Tracy says very little during some parts of the exercises and I kept finding that she had moved on to the next movement and I had missed it.  And there are MANY, MANY changes, constantly.  That's the whole premise of her exercise philosophy.  I kept having to stop the video and go back to redo some part of the routine that I had missed.
I've done many exercise routines and found this just so frustrating and I wanted it to work, too. (Like I said--the see-through dress and all.) The reason I decided to quit was that I realized that I was going to finally learn the first routine and then was going to have to move on to the next one.  You only stay on each level for 14 days, as I recall, then you move on and don't come back.  I watched the next level to see if it was any better and could see that it was just as complex and constantly changing, with just as little talking.  When I say that it is difficult, it is not that I could not do the exercises.  It's that when my head was down and not looking at the tv, I could not see that she was changing movements and sometimes this happened every few seconds.  And, truly, she says nothing some of the time.  I looked to see if there was some different track with more instruction, but could not find one.  There is a track with no music, however, which would be nice if you did like the routine and wanted your own music.
If they ever remake these videos and she speaks more it would be great.  I think the exercises seem like they are very effective.  Just too frustrating for me.",1390089600,24,2031,4.179948586118252

That said, I think the muscle transformation cd, although with bad or should I say really nonexistent cueing, is doing its job.

You should've seen my soccer legs when I was in high school. Anyway, I think it's funny a lot of the people who can't stand her workouts ... they are for silly things like her expressions, the music or something else they find humorous. Regardless, her method WORKS. From the first time I tried her moves for a week and saw my jeans were less snug and my arms were tighter...complain about the unimportant things all you want, if you stick with the program, you will see amazing results!",1388707200,32,663,4.579831932773109

There are a few things that I did not care for with the Tracy DVD's. I did not care for the music-that for me is key to getting me moving. It was background music-I guess it would be hard to use current music as it becomes outdated  but the music she picked it not for me. I also  did not care for the way she cues the moves or does not cue.!!! Some are fast paced and by the time I figured  it out we were on to the next move.  I am not a rookie and think I know what I am doing most of the time  so for a beginner I feel this would be discouraging. The moves are great,they work and you really feel the impact . I can honestly say it for me is a ho- hum workout due to music and poor cueing so it is sitting in the box on a shelf",1388707200,8,879,3.7243243243243245

I kept reading about Tracy Anderson and after seeing the infomercial one night I decided to buy her boxed set. If you follow the musculature structure work and cardio, you will get amazing results. I didn't follow her nutrition plan because it seemed too low-calorie. Even modifying the eating plan I still saw visible results. If you are looking to change the way your body looks buy TA products.
One thing to keep in mind is Tracy's instruction style is very visual. She doesn't explain her movements at all. I suggest watching the entire sequence through and then doing the movements. This box set is worth the money. If you are brand new to TA, I highly recommend getting her book to learn the nuances of her movements.",1388188800,18,828,4.639455782312925

5462248,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"I wanted to wait until at least the first 30 days to write this review, with the intention of updating it every 30 days for viewers to try and get a picture of what the process is like before buying it.

Some Background:  I have been a Jillian Michael's devotee for the past year, but saw myself bulking up without burning fat, and didn't exactly feel like I looked very feminine anymore.  I was starting to look barrel-chested and didn't like it.  I am 5'8'', 130lbs, althetic, consider myself to have a healthy diet (I NEVER eat fast or greasy food, stick to mostly veggies and fruits and lean protein, etc. but i do have a bit of a sweet tooth) and didn't really have much weight to lose, but really wanted to trim some things up.  After this I wanted to switch it up, so I decided to give Tracy a try because her method was just so entirely different than anything I was comfortable with or have ever done before.  It is by far the goofiest workout program I have followed (i am really not coordinated, and there is quite a bit of a dance-element here (which makes sense, as Tracy is a former dancer)), but I have never seen anything work as well as Tracy's method has worked for me.

I am posting this review for those who aren't overweight and consider themselves healthy, are in a healthy weight range, but just want to try something new.  I find most of the reviews on here come from heavier people, or people who haven't consistently worked out, and I feel like I often can't compare their results to mine because they tend to see any results from fitness at a much faster rate than I would.

The Positives: This is not as intense of a workout as Jillian's, but I actually dread it less and find it more effective.  I enjoy the dance cardio portion (30 minutes) because you sweat but don't feel exhausted like you can't take another step.  The muscular structure portion changes every 10 days, but also consists of several components in the 30 minutes (standing arms, arms with weights, standing abs, abs on the mat, and so far a leg lift portion).  In the first 1-3 weeks my body was so tight and pulled together, all my clothes were fitting better, and i just looked lean and fantastic.  All without the scale even moving.  I am doing Omnicentric, so I lost inches first in my bust, arms, and waist (you know how it goes ladies), and the hips and thighs budged only after 3 weeks and only budged a bit.

The Negatives:  Yes yes, she doesn't really cue you.  But I think this is just her method of instruction, she does the same thing at her studios.  If you can get over the fact that you may sometimes be catching up to her, or not doing everything perfectly all the time, then you will be fine.  I sort of find it a bit freeing, but you do have to pay attention.  Just don't freak out and get overwhelmed when you don't understand what she is doing right away.  Relax, it's supposed to be fun.  Also, if you can at least count to 8 you should be able to follow ... it's not hard people.  I did go out and buy her Dance+Cardio DVD that just came out to switch up the cardio portion a bit because it was starting to get a bit boring doing the same routine everyday.  It helped a lot.  Regarding fitness, I am currently in week 4, and let me tell you, I am feeling a bit squishy.  This is something I have read about both here and in forums, and possibly has something to do with your muscles repairing themselves, growing, swelling, and pushing out the fat that is on top of them in an unattractive way (who knows), but in the matter of days my perfectly flat stomach got pouchy.  And let me tell you, I was not happy.  After suppressing my freak-out and doing some research, this actually seems quite common, and in the next 1-2 weeks, things should firm up all over again, even better than the first time.  So just don't get discouraged and stick with it.  This is usually the phase in any workout program where people drop off (I am told).  I also thought I would have dropped at least a few pounds by now, even though I am in a healthy weight range.  However, it is the holidays and I have been cheating on the 'dynamic eating plan' pretty consistently, so that probably has something to do with it.

In conclusion, I would like to revisit this at the 60 and 90 day mark, but for right now I would say that this program has done for me what nothing else ever has, and I am committed to sticking to it through the 'squishy' 4-week phase and seeing what else happens.  If you are looking for something new and that will challenge you in ways you haven't been challenged before without becoming boring, this is for you.",1387324800,87,4631,4.315606936416185

I bought the Omnicentric because I have hips from having a kid and zero butt. Tracy gave me a lovely butt and slimmed my hips down. I'm so happy with it that even when I get into a rut and stop working out I always go back to Tracy when I get back into the swing of things. I haven't tried any of her other dvds or food things but this method is AMAZING. Also I tried the food menu and I was not in a good mood so I just got smart about eating.

5462257,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"There are aspects of this workout that are easier than the Mat Workout DVD.  For instance, the arm segments felt very easy when I began Metamorphosis after doing the Mat Workout.  They're shorter and don't consist of as many moves.  I used one pound weights at first because it felt so easy, but then my arms got too tired when I needed to support my weight on my hands and knees during the butt lifts.  I would have to take more breaks because my arms were shaking so hard.  In the Mat Workout she works your arms harder because the butt lifts are done while standing rather than on hands and knees.

The leg lift portion of this workout is so hard.  It is so, so, hard.  She exhausts the major muscle groups and then does moves that force you to use the smaller accessory muscles that are often quite weak.  When I'm done with all of it I feel completely wrung out, so much so that I have to do this workout at the end of the day or I will be physically exhausted all day.  But my body feels so much stronger.  Going up lots of stairs doesn't even feel like a chore because my quads are so much stronger, and I have so much greater stamina to hold my arms out and continue dancing in my bellydance classes.  I feel like this workout makes me a better dancer, and that's part of what motivates me to keep going.  Tracy works the muscles I'm going to need to keep doing my snake arms without taking a break.  For me, that's a big deal.

People who try this workout are dramatically polarized on the issue of whether they like or hate her teaching style.  You can see it in the reviews.  She mostly demonstrates the movements and lets you copy her, and she does give some instruction, but sometimes I still feel frustrated because these moves are so different from others I've done in the past.  It can be confusing to follow along at first.  For my own part, I like it when Tracy is quiet.  When I feel like I have the movements down, I use the ""music only"" feature to mute her and just listen to music and concentrate on the workout.  I find that her talking breaks my concentration, and I need to focus all of it and continuing to do the reps.  So I'm in the group that is completely fine with her teaching style, and I actually prefer it to other DVD trainers out there.  If you love relentlessly upbeat trainers like Chalean Johnson or Leslie Sansone or Denise Austen, or even Jillian, you may not like Tracy.  For my own part, I find those other trainers unbearable because they never shut up.  And that's OK.  Different strokes.

I think Tracy is the right trainer for me, and I'm glad I've discovered her workouts because they make me feel strong and confident and they give me greater stamina for dancing.",1383436800,47,2713,4.310276679841897

I am small and have had a history of getting hurt from many different workouts I do and workout videos. I got to the point where I felt like there would never be any workout for me because every workout i did and loved hurt me really bad.  I found Tracy Anderson after not getting worked out enough from Zumba and other programs (I love the insanity workout but with my scoliosis and knee problems I had to discontinue it after a month) i was looking at trailers of her videos on youtube and saw a lot of jumping (which is a great workout to burn calories and work different muscles in the body as well as balance.)  I got her cardio 1 DVD and i had trouble finishing it because i was so tired but my body didn't hurt and it was amazing.  Long story short I have been doing her workouts for 9 months and not only have i seen great results but i am not in pain!!!

I eat healthy and have a lot of dietary restrictions so i don't follow the diet plan.  I also like to do 45 minutes of the cardio i am 5' 1"" and started at 120lbs, i am 110 now!

My neck hurts every time from straining to watch my tv because that's the only way you know when she's switching exercises!! This is a joke.

As a former fitness instructor myself I know a few things and admittedly may be more critical than most, but TRUST ME, this is not the quality program you are expecting from such a big name in the industry. I've showed it to my friends just to get their reactions and every time I hear the same remarks: ""are you kidding me?""  ""How can you follow this?"" And the answer is, you can't! And I was a dancer and gymnast!

Let me be clear, this COULD'VE been awesome. Her moves are different and effective, it's not monotonous and boring, and the routines change up enough to make it potentially a great program. Unfortunately 90% of it is just her jumping around flailing about and trying to decipher for yourself what the heck she's doing!

Utterly self-serving and disappointing. And to be quite honest, I'm never all that sore even after the most advanced workouts. I gave it 2 stars simply because I learned some new moves and the DVD isn't totally unusable. But seriously, personal training 101: tell us what we're doing!!!",1379548800,9,1313,4.5508474576271185

Tracy's mat workout is intense, but her cueing is difficult to follow or non-existent.  She has inconsistencies with the number of reps and the form she uses on her exercises.  The camera angle changes constantly and it can be difficult to see how she is doing a move until the last rep.  Then you realize you have been doing it wrong the whole time.  Also you have to watch the tv screen constantly as she does not verbally cue you to change to another move.

Gaining and loosing the same ten pounds with my pooch belly and big booty .
I started actually doing her workout and following her diet plan . The food is so delicious and simple . People complain that it is low calorie , well duh ! Its primarily vegetables and meant as a jumpstart to weight loss . It is so nutritionally dense that even though it is lower calorie , it provides more nutrition and energy than a  typical diet .
I saw phenomenal changes in one week . Im at a week and a half and I can see where this is going . My stomach looks smaller , my butt feels higher , my digestion is better .
This is an all around healthy program . Instead of doing one part of her program and complaining , I suggest actually committing yourself to doing it right .
Yes her workout lacks cues , but its not too hard to figure it out, come on . its dancing , how is she suppose to spell out every move . ?
Im no longer mocking her , she has done more for me than insanity or p90x did and I can honestly say that I see my stomach shrinking in , not getting thicker . Im sorry I laughed . This is hard and I give her much respect . For those of you who don't get it or don't like Traci because she is confidant .. well you won't be seeing her results . I think her energy is infectious .

5462266,3,B00ANVZ8JE,"I originally purchased this set because of the amazing results my cousin got after doing the TAM Omnicentric, so I figured I'd try out the one for my body type. I'm almost at the end of Level 2, and while the muscular structure workouts seem to be doing their job, I've had to swap out the cardio (I use the Cardio Axe from Brazilian Butt Lift or the Burn Intervals from Chalean Extreme). After about a week of doing her cardio dance workout almost religiously, I had developed shin splints and it became painful to do most movements involving jumping or shuffling around. My knees were not affected, luckily. I would recommend using really good quality shoes or a rebounder if possible to avoid any long-term injury.

The ""free arms"" segments don't seem to have a whole lot of logic behind it, and it can be hard to follow, and I'm not far enough in the program to know if the weighted arm segments get any more challenging. The abs involve a lot of variations on crunches, but can tend to strain your neck.

Finally, the part of the workout that actually appeals to me the most- the muscular structure workouts specified to your body type. Since the moves require you to be on all fours, your knees get pretty banged up unless you use a thick mat/cushion or find those cushioned knee bands (braces? whatever you call them, I got them at the Japanese dollar store). For awhile, I was using a pillow under my knees because it hurt too much. But now that I've got all those little details sorted out, I enjoy the leg exercises. Since it's 40 reps of each move, I've got them memorized and can do them anytime without having to pop in the DVD.

Overall, I'd recommend this program if the right equipment is available to you. I'm already seeing results (albeit a little slower than if you stuck to her program exactly) and I'm excited to see my progress in a few more weeks.",1379116800,22,1871,4.464912280701754

I think she could explain her method a bit better than she does. Now that I understand the theory, it seems way more wonderful than she describes! I like visuals and clear description. This is where the program lacks for ME, but not a biggie. (Tracy: How about a screen inset with a computer generated image so we can all SEE what areas you are targeting, making it easier to find on our own bodies!)Through the course of the workout I have certain ""Aha!"" moments where I figure it out. I DO recommend just sitting and watching these discs FIRST! I am not yet strong enough to do these movements exactly as described. Almost 4 weeks in, I am still working towards that. I will cut the number of reps at times and do one move for her two (so as not to injure myself) At 53 and with a few injuries, I have to pace myself. Having said that, I will likely progress at a slower pace than prescribed, but that's okay! I am making PROGRESS! My arms are tightening and I noticed my jeans are now slipping off my rear! Thanks to the standing abs exercises I am VERY aware of my stomach muscles. I can feel them working. I stand straighter now and I think my posture has definitely improved. The cardio portion is pretty ambitious! I cannot get through that yet and so I have modified some moves to accommodate my weak knees. Some might argue that one could accomplish the same goals with another method. BUT, like I said before, I understand the theory of 'accessory muscles' and it makes sense to me. I feel great after these workouts and so I look forward to doing them again. That alone is HUGE for me! I have never had nice upper arms and now I see it happening, at my age, and it's enough to get me misty-eyed! Bottom line: Keep an open mind about this workout.

I'm pretty active, mixing TurboFire (Chalene Johnson) with spinning, Physique and gym work but found, after the winter, I'd put on a few lbs and had gotten a little fleshy. I've done the first 25 days now and it's worth the investment. I've been trying to do her strengthening/toning 30 minute workouts per her schedule, adding 30 minutes of aerobics (alternating her dance dvd with other stuff like TurboFire or elliptical) at least 5-6 days/ week. I've noticed a 2"" reduction in my waistline, a slightly more lifted butt as well as a 3-4 lb weight loss since I've started. My arms tend to be my problem area and this is where her workout excels; my upper arms are more toned and less fleshy. Her diet plan is plain ridiculous if you need to function as a normal, healthy person with a full-time job, so I skipped that part of her package (but I try to eat fairly healthfully, in general). She does NOT cue/coach well (the only reason why I'm docking my review by 1 star) so it helps to try her Mat workout (more instruction) as well as watch the video at least once before actually doing the moves. In most cases, the reps are around 30-40 per side. I also appreciate that she's doing the entire workout herself (unlike other DVD workouts where the instructor walks around and talks).
Initially, it seems costly but when you consider that an hour of a spin or barre class in NY might run 30-40 dollars, this pays for itself after a few days",1375056000,22,1476,4.4907063197026025

It could be a case of user error or the fact that I've never done a cardio-dance type of workout. I was just looking for a change in my workout routine and think Tracy Anderson looks amazing. So I began doing other types of cardio and then doing Tracy's 2nd workout which changes every 10 days. Some of those leg execises are really tough and I did start to notice results in my legs.

I actually have the Abcentric version, since I carry more weight in the middle.  You don't have to like Tracy to love what she can do for you.  This is hard to follow at first, it may kill you when you start out and certain parts of your body may ache a lot.  You may get annoyed with aspects of the DVDs.  All I can say is block out about an hour and 15 minutes, six times a week (I am a working mother, it can be done).  Do what you can at first and know your limits.  I needed a thick mat for the floor exercises, as my knees ached a bit, and all the jumping jack type moves can strain your lower legs until you are used to them.  If you commit, you will learn it - whether you do it exactly as she does or mix in your own moves - and you should LOVE it.  I have already seen results like that of no other program I have done.  It will be addictive once you see those results.  The great thing is that once you have it down on the transform/strength routine, she switches it up.  If you don't like the dance cardio, I would still recommend the transform/strength portion with 1/2 hour to an hour of your favorite cardio.  My only regrets are that I didn't rip open the package when I first received the DVDs and that I don't have more time to try out the diet portion.  The diet portion is interesting - every other week it is typical diet type food (probably much less food that most are used to eating in a day though), but the Nutrient Boost Weeks are something I have never tried to live on before.

Let me start by saying I've been into fitness for 30 years now (certified instructor/trainer) and have tried just about every tape, DVD and workout craze out there. I was very skeptical and not exactly the dance-y type aerobics person so at first glance the moves looked pretty strange to me especially since you only use 3lb weights but I figured if it could work for the celebs, I'd give it a try. The dance cardio takes awhile to get used to and I don't like the fact that TA doesn't cue at all. She says it's so you don't have to learn a ""routine"" but the dance cardio is a routine so more cueing and better editing would be helpful. It would also be nice to have a second dance cardio option just to break up the monotony. That being said, I do look forward to my dance cardio daily. However, I just use the voice only option with my own playlist.

The moves in the strength section are much more challenging than I expected and the 3lb weights during the arm moves add a nice challenge (even though I'm dying to add more, I've held off and stuck with the 3lb weights). The strength section changes every 10 days or so and becomes increasingly challenging which is nice.

Although I do enjoy the workouts, I feel like I'm looking skinny fat and am not quite as defined as I would like to be and was my hope from this DVD set but, I'll keep plugging along to the end and report back. Stay tuned...",1370649600,15,1562,4.291525423728814

5462300,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"OK, I've read EVERY review on Amazon, QVC, etc. about the Tracy Anderson Method.  In essence, I'm basically obsessed with the program for some reason, probably because of its polarizing nature.  I have never seen a program that is so LOVE/HATE.  Anyway, I am NOT going to go on and on about what every other reviewer out there says...not enough instruction vs. they love the minimal instruction; missing counts/cues vs. oh, well, she's human; no physiology training vs. this stuff works, etc.  I'm going to address one simple thing that I have NEVER seen in any review of TAM on any website.  Those who say the dance cardio is just jumping around and flailing their arms about, hey, we could do this at home by ourselves, why pay for THAT kind of ""training?""  To those folks I simply ask, ""Have you ever just danced about and acted crazy for 3 0  f r i c k i n g  m i n u t e s???  You would DIE of trying to come up with alternatives.  Trust me, I know!!!  I've tried that plenty before even hearing about TAM.  When my kids were young and I was trying to fit in cardio wherever I could, I'd be playing w/them while doing burpees, jumping jacks, squats, lunges, crazy moves, etc.  And I was always so proud of myself because it felt like, really, I was doing it for at least 20 minutes!!!  Lo and behold, I'd look at my clock and WTF, it had only been four minutes!!  So while I agree w/folks that the DC isn't anything new, there is something very solid about just jumping along w/someone else taking the lead for 30 minutes without having to improvise on your own.  So...for those out there thinking the DC is old news, just get it and jump along w/Tracy for Pete's sake. And if you don't like it after giving it a two-week trial, then go running or spinning or hiking or what have you, just fricking move. The muscular structure is really where it is at...that alone is worth the money for this program.
That being said, I'll leave my review about that particular grievance.  Perhaps one day I will chime in w/a full review about why this program is so weirdly effective...and why I am just beginning Year Two of the program that changed my life.",1366934400,79,2150,4.36180904522613

5462304,4,B00ANVZ8JE,"I gave Tracy Anderson's Hipcentric a try a few years ago when it first came out. I made it through 42 days of the program before I had to stop since I had so much low back pain.  I was the smallest I've been in my adult life, and so (ah, vanity!), I decided to give it another go-round, this time with Glutecentric. I posted a separate review of that set, too, but am recording my thoughts about Hipcentric here.

When I did Hipcentric, I had ordered it before the Body Type Calculator was available on her website.  Hipcentric ended up deflating my booty, which I guess is one of the classic signs that you're doing the wrong Centric.  Before ordering a system, definitely check out her website so you can be sure that you're getting the right set for your body type.

Basically, this set comes with nine Muscular Structure (MS) workouts, each of which you do for ten days.  The MS workouts are a half-hour each, and there is also a thirty-minute Dance Cardio workout that comes in the set, which you're supposed to do each day, too.  In total, you'll be working out an hour a day with this program.

Although the Tracy Anderson Method (TAM) has some problems, it really does give results if you're consistent with the workouts!  Here are some considerations to keep in mind so you can decide if this is right for you.

* Expect to be frustrated.  A lot.  I don't understand why there couldn't be better cueing on this or, especially in this day and age, chapters so you can repeat segments more easily.  I don't always know that I'm doing the correct angles that she is since the cueing is pretty much non-existent in terms of form pointers, but I'm still getting results.

* When you're on the floor, keep in mind that Tracy has her support leg not off to the side, but centered between her arms.  I didn't realize this until someone mentioned it on her blog, and since I started doing this, I've had a much easier time.

* I've found that it really helps to watch it the first time through on a laptop (if you have one) that you leave on the floor in front of you so you don't have to tweak your neck to watch a larger TV.  After the first time I do a new level, I then watch it on my TV.

* Since the second leg has no cueing, I rewind to the first side and do it over again, on the other leg, so I have the benefit of Tracy telling me when to switch exercises.

* Count on some time added in to stretch.  As I said, when I first started, I didn't take time to strech my hip flexors, and really struggled with back pain. I now take time to stretch my hips after each session, and I have no back pain.  Allow yourself 1 hour and 15 minutes total to do all this.

* I find the dance cardio disk to be boring and too high impact for my knees, so I've just been doing other dance workouts, kickboxing, and things like Tonique.

* This is a hard workout!  Really hard!  Expect to be challenged both physically and mentally - but also expect results if you put in the work!

* Yes, her belief that women should only lift three-pound weights is nuts, but when you do high-repetition workouts like this, you can't lift too much more than that anyways.

If you end up hating the program, you could always sell it on the big online auction site.  I did that with my Hipcentric set, and almost recovered the full cost that I had originally paid.

I hope this review has been helpful!

UPDATE ON 5-30-13:  After the four-week mark of doing Glutecentric, I all of a sudden started getting really ""squishy"" and cellulite-y.  In a panic, I stopped doing the workouts, and moved on to something else.  On the Video Fitness forums, however, there has been a conversation this week about how this ""squishy"" stage is part of the Metamorphosis process.  Supposedly, it happens about four or five weeks in in each of the Metamorphosis series, but then around weeks 5 or 6, things start pulling in again.

Armed with this new information, I'm going to pick back up with where I left off, but I wanted to share this information here in case it helps anyone else who panics like I did!  :-)",1365206400,171,4071,4.310526315789474

Maybe this could work for someone who's starting out but the instruction is terrible. I was terribly disappointed by it.

5462306,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"I am a fitness enthusiast and love trying new things in the name of having fun and banishing my muffin top forever.  I read all the reviews about Tracy coming off like she did an exercise video as an excuse to watch herself bounce around for 55 minutes and look cute...while neglecting to give you any instruction whatsoever as you sit abandoned in your living room, flopping around like a fish on the dock.  I figured that I was experienced enough with exercise, dance, and how to hold my body without hurting myself to maneuver through it.  I was MOSTLY right, although I can't imagine I was getting the most out of it.  I need someone like Jillian Michaels to remind me of my form and encourage me at the same decibel level so I REALLY have to listen to know which it is.

It's ENTIRELY true that Tracy gives little to no help on form while the camera angles offer no insight, but it's not too hard to follow the moves and do them for maximum results--you just have to push YOURSELF, because she won't do it.  During the Dance Cardio portion, she just moves around.  It doesn't seem to follow any rhyme or reason--type A personality exercisers should stay far away, because this ""routine"" reminded me of just dancing for fun.  Having said that, it was it HARD.  I did it a few times and could mostly follow, and always had to take a breather.  I guess when the apocalypse comes, and you need someone to dance for the lives of everyone in your rag tag group of survivors, call Tracy.  She's in top form.

I didn't stick with this one because Tracy shows little to no personality that I could attach to (unlike the charisma of Jillian or Leandro Carvalho from Brazilian Butt Lift that keeps me working), and combined with the lack of instruction, I felt like I was wasting my time and was going to hurt myself with all that joint impact.  Tracy's exercises are fine, and she has a GREAT ab workout, but this one bored me because I was just watching a hot chick mostly ignore me.  Now I know how nerdy guys in high school feel.",1364774400,58,2027,4.385026737967914

5462308,2,B00ANVZ8JE,"Where do I begin with Tracy Anderson Metamorphosis? When I first went to tracy's website, I was impressed with how clean, techy, and easy to navigate it was. It didn't seem gimicky and I liked that. It didn't take me long to realize though that it seems tracy is EXTREMELY into herself and that drives me crazy while I'm working out. When I received my DVD set I immediately realized that it's plastered with her in pictures of herself in bikini/lingerie type outfits. Tracy doesn't leave much to be unseen and thats uncomfortable for me. I want to feel like I'm working out with my friends, or in a relaxed environment and not like I am far inferior to the girl on screen. Now onto the DVD's. Tracys flaunting of herself doesnt stop at the advertising. She doesn't wear a bra in her workouts. WHAT KIND OF PERSON DOESNT WEAR A BRA WHILE WORKING OUT!? she literally drives me nutts LOL! Onto the workout. It's a pretty fun work out but I imagine that there are much more fun ones out there on the market. She calls it ""dance aerobics"" but your basically just jumping up and down the whole time. She doesn't explain the moves AT.ALL. for me that is frustrating because I'm not a dancer and appreciate the extra instruction. She doesnt give guidance on how to accomplish the move OR on what muscles it should be targeting. She also doesnt say when she's transitioning into a different move and this can be especially frustrating when your doing floor muscle work. I like that the workout gets me sweating and hopefully in shape. Like I said its fun enough to keep me moving but I still have to motivate myself quite a bit more than i just enjoy the workout. The music on the DVDs is pretty boring and I always mute it and turn on the radio instead. Also, all of her instructions are pre recorded so it doenst feel like shes actually talking to you because her face is blank the entire time and you just hear her voice in the background. Over all, I don't like this program but i paid 89$ for it so I'm going to suck it up and finish the 90 days.",1363996800,18,2043,4.364829396325459
5462309,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"If I were to have rated Tracy's Metamorphosis program when I first purchased it, from Tracy's site, I wouldn't have wanted to even give it 1 star.  Because I was a Jillian Michaels devotee,  and Tracy's Method was strange, and completely different from anything I'd ever done.  I found her lack of instruction frustrating, and hated the music.  I wanted to return it, but luckily for me, Tracy's site doesn't allow returns of any open product.  So I was STUCK with it.

I've given it 5 stars today, based on my RESULTS.  I'm now on Continuity Year 2, and I'm SO grateful to her.  Her method is changing my body in a way that I never dreamed possible  I'm 49 and I've never felt or looked better.  NEVER!  But if you're new to Tracy Anderson's Method and don't want to spend any time feeling frustrated, do yourself a favor and don't start with Meta.  Unlike Jillian Michaels who releases a new stand alone DVD all the time, Tracy's Method is really an evolution and builds upon itself.  Read her 30 Day Method Book (Hardcover comes with a great DVD which has 3 different muscle structure routines (1 for every 10 days and Dance Cardio)  Then try her Dance Cardio DVD and Mat Workout DVD.  That's where you'll find all the explanations and instructions you'll need to fall in love with Tracy's method and become addicted to the results.  Doing Tracy's Mat Workout is still one of my favorite ways to spend an hour.  I also recommend her Perfect Design Series.  By the time Tracy created Meta, I think she expected everyone to be familiar with her method so it doesn't contain as much instruction or explanations as her earlier DVDs.  But if you don't want to do her older workouts, Meta is still VERY doable.  I know because I did it.  You just have to be willing to be patient with yourself.  Don't expect perfection from day one.  The cardio portion of the Meta program might feel like you're watching Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance, but just step your way through the parts that are too hard for you.  You're gong to be doing the same moves for 90 days.  Trust me you WILL learn what's coming next, and you'll be grateful that she doesn't talk through the entire workout.  When doing the Muscle Structure workouts for the first time, you will have to watch it once and count the reps, usually it's 40, but big deal.  You should watch any DVD before doing it the first time, anyway.  Yes.  The music sucks, but I'd rather use my own music anyway.  Changing the music keeps the workouts feeling fresh and new.  I've never followed Tracy's Diet Plan, it was definitely too restrictive for me, but I agree with the healthy principals behind her plan...  no processed foods, lots of fresh veggies and fruits, lean protein, and after watching Hungry for Change and Fat Sick and Nearly Dead I started juicing.

If you're looking for a program that produces the results that it promises, and you're willing to make a commitment to yourself and stick with it.  Tracy's program will get the job done.  When I started the Meta program I was 47, with a bad knee, bad wrists, and a bad shoulder.  I stepped my way through some of the moves, and took a break between reps when I needed it.  Every day I got stronger.  Now, working out to Tracy's Method for an hour 6 days a week, is something I look forward to doing.  I'm officially addicted but that's a good thing.",1363737600,621,3360,4.490909090909091
5462310,1,B00ANVZ8JE,"I was so excited to get this DVD after hearing Gwyneth Paltrow's rave reviews of Tracy, but I guess working with her in person is much better than following this DVD.  There is absolutely no direction.  You just jump right into hopping around on the cardio segment with no idea when she's going to switch to a different side, to a different move...nothing!!  I felt like a spaz in my own home.  I just hopped around the best I could on my own, trying my darndest to follow her just the slightest.  Three kicks here, 2 hops there, 4 skips, etc.  I was clueless!  I believe there should be a segment for beginners--going over the moves 'slowly' that she does throughout the cardio.

The transform section was slightly easier to follow but there was no cuing.  I had no idea when we were switching to a new move.  A simple 'we'll do this 10 times' would have sufficed.  When you switch to the other side of a body part, there is absolutely no reiterating what was just done.  She is completely silent.  It would be a perfect time for her to remind us of good form, etc.  I think you'd have to do this for a few weeks to get it down, but after 10 days, you're on to the next transformation disk so there's really not much time to learn it.
Because I spent so much on this, I will give it a try for a couple more weeks but most likely I will sell it used.  If you've trained with Tracy personally, then I'm sure you can follow this.  Otherwise, expect a very sore neck from having to watch to see what she's doing throughout (while you're on the floor too), especially never knowing the amount of reps before she switches to a new move.  I do NOT recommend this.  I will slowly go through the DVD counting the sets and writing them down for myself so I have a clue next time I do it.  Don't trust celebrity endorsements.",1363392000,30,1815,4.254385964912281
5462311,1,B00ANVZ8JE,"Beware. I just ordered the DVD set paid 89.97 plus processing and Handling and tax for a total of 113.88. I didn't order from Amazon, I ordered from the Tracy Anderson Website. The set of 4 DVD's arrived in 10 days and it made me miss my amazon prime shipping. I put in the first DVD, it's ok, it has her introduction which is Tracy talking about her program and then her 30 minute cardio workout on the same DVD. I decided to play the second DVD Transform 1 and guess what it was a religious DVD selling a product, no Tracy Anderson workout. I checked the next 2 DVD's and they were ok. Seriously??????? Where is the quality control? I called the company and they said ""...oh yeah that's been happening it's an error and we'll send you a replacement DVD that will arrive in 7 - 10 days.""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tracy-Anderson-Metamorphosis-by-Tracy-Omnicentric-4-DVD-Set/dp/B00ANVVQYA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tracy Anderson - Metamorphosis by Tracy - Omnicentric - 4 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;The religious DVD was a 60 minute low budget DVD with Tracy Anderson's name, logo and workout printed on it. There were no apologies from the company. It's a lot of money for something that is mediocre, might want to check out the Firm DVD's or Gaiam.com. They both have been around for eons and have a track record. Tracy appears to be celebrity hype. Celebrities have a whole team on board in their multiple workout routines, trainers, nutritionists, health consultants, plastic surgeons and more. If it looks too good to be true, it just might be.

I have to agree with the other reviews, the nutritional plan looks not well researched. You might want to think twice before ordering. I recommend that you do your own research before spending this kind of money.",1363305600,18,1798,5.053872053872054
8554984,3,B00ANVZ8JE,I'm not sure I purchased the right program for my body type. The meal plan was bland so difficult to maintain. Everyone's different! Worth a try :),1528588800,,147,4.481481481481482
8554985,5,B00ANVZ8JE,"Just did the first workout of Omnicentric and loved it. I've done a few other TAM workouts in the past, so I knew what was coming. I do agree with other reviewers that you should do some research on her method/moves before diving in since she doesn't really explain the moves or cue. I didn't have an issue with her lack of explanation since it seems pretty self-explanatory based on watching her. I do wish she cued for the 2nd leg, but others have suggested replaying the video from the first left in order to have cues. While a bit cumbersome, I think it's worth it since it only requires you to rewind once.
I'm 27 years old, weigh 145lbs and am 5'6"". I'm in okay shape, but I don't workout more than 3 times a week currently. Usually, it's closer to 1-2 times a week. I found all of the moves doable, but I did have to stop for breaks during the floor leg routine. I could see this being difficult/ineffective for someone who is much heavier than me. This almost feels like the last step in a body transformation. I don't see myself losing weight with this system, but I do hope it'll change the way my body looks. This also has to do with the fact that I don't plan to follow her diet (I already eat sensibly) nor her cardio dvd (based on everyone else opinion of it). My favorite thing about this is that 3 hours later I can already feel my sore muscles! I think this is because I am so used to working my larger muscles (squats, deadlifts, hip thursts, bench press) that my body is shocked to be forced to use the smaller accessory muscles that this DVD works. Another great thing is how fast it goes by. I think this has something to do with the lack of talking from Tracy. I used to do a lot of Jillian Michaels videos and she did so much talking that I memorized what she said and I knew how far a was in the work out based on her phrases, making it feel longer. Not sure if that makes any sense, but overall I feel the workout goes by very quickly. It's definitely difficult and I was sweating quite a bit, but I can't wait to do it again tomorrow.
