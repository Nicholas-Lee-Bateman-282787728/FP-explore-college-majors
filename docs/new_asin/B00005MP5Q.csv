7946069,5,B00005MP5Q,"This is a remake of the 1969 series created by Dennis Spooner. It was where a lot of the talent that worked on The Avengers went after that show wrapped; however, it's amazing the talent acquired for this remake, including David Tenant, Hugh Laurie, Martin Clunes, and Peter Bowles among the guest actors. David Arnold, who went onto compose the soundtracks for several James Bond movies, did the music for this version, where he is better suited.

This show is a variation on Thorne Smith's Topper. It's about a small private investigation agency run by a Jeff Randall (Bob Mortimer) & Martin Hopkirk (Vic Reeves). Marty dies working on a case, but returns as a ghost to help Jeff find his murderer. When Marty finds himself cursed to walk for another 100 years, he helps Jeff with his cases. Marty also finds Prof. Wyvern (Tom Baker) to act as his mentor in ghostlihood. Emilia Fox plays Hopkirk's surviving fiance, Jeannie Hurst. Writer, Producer & Director Charlie Higson also makes a point of taking on a different role in each episode.

This version is much faster paced than the original with a lot of little acknowledgments to the original series. The scripts are decent with some amusing scenes. Jeannie is also much feistier than previously. Although this series was once aired on BBC America, the biggest weakness of this DVD set is that it is region 2 only. Americans need a region-free DVD or BluRay player to be able to watch it.",1418774400,2,1443,4.745019920318725
7946070,1,B00005MP5Q,"DO NOT, ...repeat, DO NOT buy this remake by mistake, thinking you are getting the Brit. original.
This is just SO goddamned awful as to defy description.
Incredibly bad over-acting from surprisingly familiar names too.
It's normally against my form to condemn anything without watching it in its entirety, but this turkey is SO bad I couldn't take it a moment longer.
Absolutely without even so much as a single redeeming feature.
Should be buried to stop it stinking up the place!
Why can't I award NO stars! It pains me to even have to give this the one, just to warn others who might purchase this thinking they were getting the original!",1393804800,4,642,4.6902654867256635
7946071,4,B00005MP5Q,"I knew nothing about the series while it was playing, but thanks to the DVD have had a chance for a bit of amusement. One of two partners in an investigation agency dies but his ghost remains to carry on the business. Save for one episode, only the remaining partner can see or hear him, the ghost,  on the other hand, has little power to do anything but be where he cannot be seen. Their adventures are mild, the comedy is not uproarious, but the sum is quite pleasant. Worth the price of admission.",1351036800,2,500,4.319148936170213
7946072,1,B00005MP5Q,"I picked this up because I LOVE every thing else that Reeves and Mortimer have ever done, (especially Catterick). This, however, has none of the absurd and surreal humor that I need. I watched the first few episodes, and I can say for certain that I was not entertained in the least. I do not doubt that if I were a brit, (I am american), this would speak to me on some level; but as things are, I fail to see any value in Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased).",1312070400,2,454,4.170454545454546
