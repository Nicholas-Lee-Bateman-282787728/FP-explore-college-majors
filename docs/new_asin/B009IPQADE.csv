5340619,5,B009IPQADE,"Having followed the Tower of Power from here on the other coast since their first album, I always thought I was part of a special family to be a fan of these excellent musicians and people. As if people from the East Coast didn't have the same kind of musical taste that I did, like that level of horn section fluidity was not for everybody's ear.  I have followed their many progressions through the years, even when they weren't putting out their own albums, they were on others and I bought those just to hear them one more time.  At the point that their ""Monster On A Leash"" CD came out,  I'd thought that they had given up and moved on.  Since then, they have put out some monster CDs.

This CD set highlights the best of all those....I would have put a few different tunes in,  but there was quite a discography to pull from and I'm highly pleased with the end result.  I probably could have done without the interviews in the middle of songs on the DVD....but the CD itself with the extra horns lets you know this is an exemplary collection.  It's getting much airplay in my house. And, if you're down with TOP,  it'll get its fair share of airplay at your place as well.",1301270400,,1178,4.318181818181818
5340620,4,B009IPQADE,"I excitedly pre ordered both the cd and dvd of this concert not realising the cd actually contains a dvd as well. This dvd is exactly the same as the dvd that comes with the cd. Save your money folks and buy the cd which comes with the dvd. It's even cheaper this way! Saying that, brillian concert. Great sounds and so so so much better than previous Tower dvd's that have been released.

5340621,4,B009IPQADE,"This DVD has been over 2 years in the making as the concert was held at San Francisco's Fillmore on October 18th, 2008. There have been countless delays and I'm sure the making of the DVD could, in itself, be a documentary. I was there that night in the front row and I can tell you this was an amazing live show. Everyone truly came to play that night, and play hard they did, The concert is packed with ToP alumni (Chester Thompson, Richard Elliott, Greg Adams, and Ellis Hall just to name a few, Lenny Williams was invited but did not go) and special guests, notably Soul Man Sam Moore (even the ""ghost"" of Bill Graham was there to introduce the band). There were tons of outstanding musicians playing lots of great solos.

THE PERFORMANCES ARE OUTSTANDING!!!! These songs have never sounded better. The sound quality is superb. Video quality is high. Camera work is about a B- but at least it doesn't suffer from 2-second edits common in concert videos.

BUT (big but).... I don't like concert DVDs interrupted by interviews and you probably don't either, but this DVD takes this editing technique to a new level by actually interrupting some songs right in the middle of amazing jams, sometimes two and three times a song, virtually ruining them. RIDICULOUS! Greg Adams says it perfectly at the end of the DVD: ""Really, as is fitting, we should let the music speak for itself""!

This is not the whole concert and while some songs and introductions are missing, the songs aren't necessarily in the right order either. The DVD doesn't flow very well.

Sure, it took about the same time to complete as did the Bay Bridge the band drove over to get to this gig, but this DVD set is a funkin' hip groove of monumental proportions - a MUST have, but could have been even better.",1294876800,21,1777,4.561128526645768
5340622,5,B009IPQADE,"TOP is one of the world's best bands . . . ever!  However, after 40 years most bands slip into lazy predictability especially after churning up the lineup half a dozen times.  This is where Emilio, Doc, Dave, and Rocco come in.  Emilio is the band leader (extraordinaire) and visionary, while Doc (baritone sax), Dave (funky drummer), and Rocco (best bass around), constitute the finest rhythm section anywhere.  They came to play!

Despite some close calls in the 80s, they have never made a bad album.  However, I was a little skeptical about a forty year reunion.  That's a long time and who would be on the stage?  An all new line up again?

Past alumni and the present lineup combine effortlessly to expand the music to something special.  The band continues to grow as alumni continue to join on stage.  By the end of the show there are 3 or 4 guitarists, a dozen horn players, and a couple of drummers and keyboard players.  This might be a mess, but this is TOP and they don't do messes.  It is super.  A very special reunion that is executed with precision, enthusiasm, and exciting energy.

My only wish is that there were some archival film of the old TOP.  I hadn't remembered how much Lenny Picket stole the show in the 70s until I saw him play in some film here (he is not on the formal concert stage).  He truly was a monster on a leash.",1382745600,,1352,4.4089068825910935

5340628,5,B009IPQADE,"This DVD just blew my socks off! - In my opinion, TOP is the best american band in the business. Any band that can survive 40 + years in the music business and stay true to the high standard they set in 1968, has my vote. This DVD features allot of the players that are no longer with the band and some great guests (Dave Matthews, for example) that give the band an extra shot of excitement to their already high energy performances. If you are a fan of this band, get this DVD if you don't have it. If you don't know this band, get this DVD. It will take you on a musical tour that will prove quality always stands the test of time.
I still don't know why this band has not been inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of fame - nobody deserves it more.",1368057600,,750,4.006666666666667

5340634,5,B009IPQADE,"I'm a long-standing TOP fan, so my review may be a little biased. I love their music and have been fortunate enough to catch them live many times over the years.

It was fun to see (and hear) TOP alumni at this show. The band brought back several former members to help celebrate their 40th anniversary. The audio is great, as are the extra features (interviews with band members and a review of the band's history) but as mentioned in the title, it's NOT filmed in HD. That beinig said, the band was on great form. Bump City!",1358985600,,526,4.36734693877551

Appears to be a ""filmed"" Tower of Power stage performance instead. Once again on Blu-ray, no lossless audio option as the choices are standard 2 channel or Dolby 5.1.  Quick note for those thinking about ordering this title so you wouldn't make the same mistake I think I did.  Quick 2-star rating (less than an average production when compared to the many other Blu-ray concert/music titles I also own) is appropriate for the as presented video quality and lack of expected lossless audio options on this disk.

I had recently seen TOP in Orlando live (spring 2012) and was blown away by their incredible performance and sound... probably one of the best sounding concerts I have ever heard in my life. They are better now than ever... this DVD which I heard about at the show, captures them live for ever in my mind, plus has the extra background history of the band which I really enjoyed.. excellent sound, and picture quality.... Amazing when they bring out all the members who throughout the years... forms a ""super"" band with so many horns and keyboards etc. on the stage... just a great group of guys and awesome music that will live on for a long long time...

5340644,5,B009IPQADE,I've always been a big fan of Tower of Power and recently saw them in concert at Parker Playhouse in Ft. Lauderdale.  That's where I learned of their 40th Anniversary DVD.  I purchased it from Amazon and have watched it several times already.  It's absolutely outstanding!  The sound quality is great and the performances by the band are wonderful.

It's so wonderful to see all the current band members performing with ToP alumni on one stage!!

It's a ""must have"" for any ToP fan.",1318464000,,450,4.857142857142857
5340649,5,B009IPQADE,"Tower of Power on of the best bands out there after 40 years. The CD / DVD is very good. Like the part were past members play again, makes the whole concert more memorable.",1305417600,,172,4.088235294117647
5340650,1,B009IPQADE,"I picked up Tower of Power's 40th Anniversary dvd recently, mainly to see and hear Greg Adams' unique take on his more than 25 years with the group. I was a BIG fan of the group the whole time he was in it precisely because of his unique style of writing and his voice both as an arranger and as a player.

His leaving the group left a void (in my opinion) that was never filled. Try as they might, and although they have carried on, TOP has attempted to ""cookie cutter"" Adams' unique style and conception of writing on to the horn section. Yet, try as they might, the arrangements are sterile and clinical, with none of the heft and ""soul-weight"" that Adams' unique voice has. I say that with nothing against the arrangers or players. What they've attempted to do (which is in itself a tip of the hat to Adams' influence) has been a valiant one, but it hasn't quite worked. It isn't bad, but it's just not the real thing, to quote one of the most famous ad campaigns of all time. (If you want to hear where that ""void"" went, it's alive and well on a CD called, ""East Bay Soul."")

Adams' contributions to the band's success can hardly be measured when you realize that at the time TOP hit the scene, for the most part the only ""horn bands"" that were getting any kind of broad recognition were Blood, Sweat & Tears and Chicago. What Greg was doing at that time was unlike anything those bands or any other bands were doing. Before Adams, no one had funked-up a band's sound and style by orchestrating 5 horns the way he did. He essentially transformed a fledgling soul band into one of the most recognizable in the history of funk and soul - a band which, without him, would probably still be in Fremont playing pool halls and dives.

The producer(s) who put TOP's 40th together obviously knew this when they chose to strike any acknowledgement of Adams' essential contributions to the band out of the interviews that were included on the dvd. Even founding members of the band were shown to have said nothing about how important his writing and arranging was. Whether their comments were edited out or not, I don't know. But if they DID acknowledge Adams and his efforts and they were censored out of the film, whether they realize it or not, they've been party to the producers' obvious intention to essentially rewrite history the way they want it to be told...

Instead of a realistic picture of the band's history, what we have is founding member Emilio Castillo essentially being followed around by a mute Stephen Kupka (his co-writer and ""best friend"") and Dave Garibaldi, (who made his debut on the very first TOP album) to various ""stops"" marking the band's beginnings. Watching, it's painfully obvious that even with his ""honorable mentions"" of certain other band members, Castillo wants to give himself all the credit for the band's success. Not coincidentally, those ""honorable mentions"" follow suit, parroting Castillo's apparent need to be recognized as the one who alone was instrumental in effecting virtually everything about the band that made it successful.

However, anybody who knows anything about the band KNOWS that a very substantial piece of the band's history and success (i.e; who the creative force of the horn section was) has been left out. Adams didn't just lead the horn section. He crafted its very sound and style from the very beginning. Whatever the members of the horn section had in terms of their personal musical style was essentially harnessed and used in service to what was clearly a very unique and creative ""vision"" that he had for them as a section, not to mention how it served the band as a whole.

There's a song called ""Jump, Shout & Holler"" on Adams' ""East Bay Soul"" CD that captures in a proverbial musical nutshell what he does so EXTREMELY well. He infuses it with a sense of itself that I would bet even the writer probably didn't have. His arrangement, in other words, elevates the song to something not just different, but better. You can't say that about some songs. With or without a great arrangement, certain songs can stand on their own. ""J,S&H,"" like so many other songs that Adams has put his unique stamp on (including virtually all of the iconic songs that made TOP famous), is not just better, it's a whole different musical ""animal.""

If I didn't know better, and if I believed in reincarnation, I would think that in another life Greg Adams was something of a literary master. The musical questions, answers and parenthetical interjections he incorporates in his arrangements are literary in ways that are cohesive through lines of thought, as well as driving forces that make the songs as ""whole pies"" more interesting than specific and separate aspects of them. Put a little differently (and once again to use a culinary term), I would liken an arrangement of Adams' to a kind of binding agent that infuses a song with a character and depth it so desperately needs, and which the song wouldn't have without it.

Mr. Castillo & Company know how Adams' talent has contributed to the band and yet they've clearly chosen to simply treat the group's history as having been devoid of Adams' influence, essentially ignoring the fact that he was ever there - like he had nothing to do with TOP's sound and direction. Such a choice is not only a very clear statement as to their regard for someone who played with them for so many years and who contributed immeasurably to the group's sound and success, but a sad and regrettable one - at least it should be to those responsible for making it...",1304553600,5,5557,4.663265306122449
5340651,5,B009IPQADE,"This weekend my copy of the dvd and cd arrived through amazon and has been playing almost non stop. If you are in for a treat of some real Oakland soul/funk energy, go buy this! With the extra horns from the past (Greg Adams, Rihard Elliot, Bill Churchville to nam a few) it sounds fuller and richer than ever. Personal favourite is As surely as I stand here. A stunning perfomance with high quality vocals of LB and keys by Chester Thompson (which I truly miss in Santana nowadays). Enjoy.

8542061,1,B009IPQADE,"I ordered the Blu-ray - thinking I was getting a ""high-definition"" experience... isn't that what they advertise?

Instead, the show is an NTSC 4:3 transfer to 720p - and not a great one at that.  There is no DTS or even DTS-HDMA - which one expects when ordering a modern music concert (Most good ones are in this format) - it is AC3 stereo or AC3 surround at a ""modest"" bit rate.  Very disappointing...

Since getting a large screen and surround system, I buy music Blu-rays specifically for the high definition experience - and this is not HD... but unless you really read the ""fine print"" its easy to think otherwise.... so in my opinion Amazon should take some responsibility here:  they put DVD reviews for Blu-ray releases claiming ""excellent"" video and excellent audio... its like false advertising, except since this is done by the public, I guess Amazon feels its OK for the public to mis-represent the product on their behalf.  This happens all the time on Blu-ray releases (with DVD reviews) and unfortunately I missed it this time around... so I take responsibility for that.
