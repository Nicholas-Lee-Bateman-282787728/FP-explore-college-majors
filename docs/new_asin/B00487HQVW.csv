4285854,4,B00487HQVW,"Everything about this new series is pretty enjoyable, EXCEPT for two main things...

1) The complete change in dynamics between the characters with the whole ""romantic interest"" addition.  I really don't understand the point of this... well, I mean I do understand the point, but it just doesn't work, and detracts more than enhances.  They should just let the characters be the friends they've always been, and leave the romance stuff for short storyline stints outside of the normal cast.

2) The complete change in personality of Fred and Velma.  What were they thinking!?!?  I'm certainly not one to mind changes, but they've nearly ruined the very essence of what made these two characters great (not to mention what made them work, and stand the test of time, for over 40 years now).  I think I understand what they were trying to do, but they just went WAY too far with it.  They should have kept both of these characters in the same vein as the ""What's New Scooby Doo"" series, which I think was a perfect blend of the original characters updated slightly with some more humorous elements.

Unfortunately, those two things make this series a little hard to swallow.  On top of this, about half the episode's storylines are REALLY weak.  The only thing that saves this series is that it's Scooby Doo, and Scooby Doo is awesome!... Scooby is unchanged, Shaggy is great (and Matthew Lillard is great), and there's some really entertaining and witty humor and dialog thrown in here and there throughout all the episodes.  Plus, SOME of the story content is good, and Mister ""E"" is kind of interesting.  Combined together... despite being personally really disappointed in a show that had huge potential for greatness... the show still manages to maintain itself as an enjoyable watch for me.  I really hope they straighten out some of what they've messed up on here as future episodes unfold. I will definitely be buying this DVD to support the franchise and hope it stays around for a while.

There are in fact a few other things I don't like... other changes they've made from previous Scooby gang incarnations... but I consider them to be minor in comparison, and possibly just my own personal bias... so I'm not going to bother mentioning them here.  I've covered the most important stuff.

Whoever is writing this series, they need to be paying attention to the latest Scooby movies that have been made... Camp Scare and Abracadabra Doo... because both of those were simply brilliant in every way, from characters to storylines.  It's obviously a different set of people that must be working on the movies and the series.",1294012800,21,2629,4.830357142857143
4285855,5,B00487HQVW,"Understandably, some of you are upset by the ""updates"" to the series.  I happen to LOVE every element.  I think it's great to update the characters and have Fred and Daphne and Velma and Shaggy dance around romantic relationships.  Plus, the original series always hinted at Fred being a lug, Daphne being overly vain and Velma having crushes (yes, she really should be a lesbian).  I actually love the addition of the parents and how they protect the town for tourism.  If you watch closely in the scenes in the Dinkley's museum - you'll see lots of references to monsters from the original series.  The show has some awesome jokes and I find myself guffawing loudly while watching (and I'm in my 40's!).  The mysteries are great - and scary - and the overarching mystery of the original Mystery, Inc. along with Mr. E is fantastic.  Every time they advance the story arc with reveals (I actually gasped at the reveal in the pet insane asylum!), it just draws me in deeper.  I am a HUGE Scooby Doo fan (have been since I was a wee one - I was born the same year Scooby Doo - Where Are You? premiered) and I think this is a great continuation of the series.  After the very disappointing live-action ""Scooby Doo and the Curse of the Lake Monster,"" I'm very pleased that the animated Scooby Doo continues strong.  Although I'll agree with the rest of you that delivering the short series on multiple discs is annoying.  It was hard enough to find on Cartoon Network as it did not show every week.  Just give us all 13 episodes in one package!!",1294012800,4,1542,4.483870967741935
4285856,2,B00487HQVW,"The good: The ""Mr E"" storyline is very interesting, and the bad guys are some of the creepier looking in the Scooby world - good monsters with good (usually) motives.

The bad: The mysteries in this series play second fiddle to the absolutely horrid romance plots - the monsters and the clues seem almost like an afterthought thrown in to keep it from being a soap opera with a talking dog. Freddie, one of the smartest characters in the original series, is a bumbling idiot with no intuition whatsoever. Velma, also one of the smarter series characters, is a whiny, completely unlikeable teenage girl who is possessive, clingy, wanting to change the guy she supposedly likes, who is jealous of a DOG... In fact, she personally makes the show barely, it at all, watchable. Its a train wreck.",1293753600,9,791,4.731884057971015
4285857,1,B00487HQVW,"I've been watching Scooby Doo cartoons since I was old enough to say his name.  I loved the original series.  So why has each subsequent revision gotten worse and worse?

We have Matthew Lillard reprising Shaggy in this series. I absolutely love that.  I really wish they could have gotten the guy who did the voice of Scooby in the live movies to do Scooby's voice.  Of all of the amazing voices that Frank Welker can do, Scooby just isn't one of them.

Personality-wise, Shaggy and Scooby are pretty much the same.  That's where the similarities end.  Velma is a nagging girlfriend to Shaggy.  Daphne has a unrequitted crush on Freddie. And Freddie, well he's a moron.  In fact, every incarnation of Freddie that has been created has dropped in IQ since he was portrayed in ""A Pup Named Scooby Doo.""  It was understandable when he was a child, but the original character was at least the second smartest member of the group.  What they've done to him since is a tragedy.

Not to mention the stupid supporting characters.  The parents are universally incompetant and Freddie's father, the mayor, would rather the gang leave the monsters alone, since they are fodder for tourism.  And some of these monsters are actually dangerous, like the phantom tractor trailer that kept running people off the road.  And don't get me started on the idiot that they have for a sheriff.

I was always willing to suspend disbelief for a talking dog.  But the rest of this has really made me loathe this newest Scooby Doo cartoon.",1293667200,7,1514,4.692015209125476
4285858,5,B00487HQVW,"This show is a direct sequal to the 1969 series from Hannah-Barbera. Also the first series not to be shown as a Saturday morning cartoon. I believe it to be just as Eerie as the original series and it captures the original flavor of the show, with one set back. Velma is in love with shaggy. Yes that's what I said. Of course Shaggy does not feel the same way. It is the only part of the show that could be left out. Otherwise the monsters and the villians are great. Voices by Lewis Black, Patrick Warburton, Mindy Cohn, Frank Welker, Maurice Lamarche and bringing back Casey Kasem as Colton Rogers. It is a must see incarnation of the Scooby Doo franchise. Even though it is released on a partial collected set of volume one. A must see.  There are only 13 episodes in the series. I do not understand why it could not be released as a complete series. That is the only big dissapointment. My rating is for the quality of the show, not for it's marketing scheme of vol. 1",1293580800,3,972,4.311475409836065

4285870,2,B00487HQVW,"My boys love Scooby Doo, and when my son saw this on Netflix he couldn't wait to watch it.  Unfortunately, it's nothing like the original.  The characters are all off.  Daphne was never obsessed with Fred. They are cute together, but her obsession in these new episodes is too much.  And Fred is not an idiot, like they've made him out to be in these.  Velma and Shaggy?  Cute, I guess, but Velma would never be jealous of Scooby, and likewise, Scooby would not be jealous of Velma.  Silly.  There seems to be a little too much teenage drama for a show for children, not teens.  And what's up with making all their parents rich and snobby.  We've met Fred's parents in some of the Scooby movies, they were kinda cool, why change them completely?  The mysteries are okay, but too many changes to the characters.",1365206400,,810,4.47945205479452
4285871,1,B00487HQVW,"Hello amazon :) well, I am an old friend of Scooby's, since my little brother has been obsessed with it since he was about two years old. I've told myself that I don't like it, basically because it's about 75% of what I've been hearing from my little bro for the past seven years. But actually, I've grown rather fond of Scooby and the gang.

The original cartoons were a classic. Really. They illustrated exactly what scooby doo was about: fun, lighthearted mysteries that encouraged you to think about who had done it, and attached you to a lovable cast of brilliant and headstrong characters. The characters were the first thing that this show messed up. I'm honestly not sure what they were thinking when they turned a strong leader into a stupid jock, a smart respectable young lady into a guy-obsessed stalker, a resourceful and endearingly stubborn girl into the Scooby equivalent of Bella from twilight, and Scooby Doo into a jealous disheartened dog that you don't really feel acquainted to. This is what they did when they decided to put mystery solving next to dramatic, romantic soap opera-ish scenes that shouldn't be in scooby doo.

See, like I said before: Scooby Doo is supposed to be fun and lighthearted, because kis are mostly going to warch this. But this show just hangs in some limbo between the age ratings. The poor younger kids are going to be turned off by all the romance, drama, and DEATH! People aren't supposed to die in Scooby Doo. But, yes, Warner Brothers went there. And the teens, like myself, are going to fondly remember the old Scooby Doo, then look at this, and say ""What the **** is this ****!?!?!?""

In summary, Warner Brothers took a classic cartoon filled with headstrong, respectable, lovable characters, lighthearted mysteries, and good mysteries, and turned it into a weird soap opera drama filled with real monsters, too much romance, and stupid teenagers that will do anything to get a boyfriend. And that was just what I got from a few episodes. I couldn't watch the whole thing, and neither could my little brother.",1360713600,3,2065,4.778711484593837
4285872,1,B00487HQVW,There is to much drama first of all. Second of all it is not funny. The original Scooby is what you want.

4285874,5,B00487HQVW,"I grew up watching Scooby Doo, it was always one of those silly, but endearing cartoons, pretty predictable in scenario, but enjoyable nonetheless. Now that I am an adult, I find myself looking forward to Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated! The characters have been elevated to help identify with them and every single one has a much deeper personality. Even Vincent Van Ghoul, I recently watched one of the old cartoons and I am so happy to see his character again! I mean, I am not longer a kid, but these series are great! I follow them daily! With Season 01 of Mystery Incorporated I found myself extremely curious as of what happens to Crystal Cove, can't wait for season two.

4285876,2,B00487HQVW,"I bought this, and the other two volumes that complete the series, for my daughter, who just can't get enough of Scooby Doo.

However, three discs, packaged and sold individually at an average of $10, brings me to a total of about $30 for a SHORT (12-episode) season.

Add to that the fact that the plastic cases are beyond flimsy, and I'm not feeling like this was my best-value Amazon purchase.

The compression quality is not exactly stellar either, which is inexcusable given how little material is on each disc.",1343520000,3,516,4.711111111111111

4285878,3,B00487HQVW,"When my kids and I first saw that there was a new ""Scooby Doo"" series, we were thrilled-- we're big Scooby fans at this house. And, when we saw that Shaggy and Velma were having a clandestine romance, I thought, ""Oh, how CUTE-- about time!"" And, the Daphne/Freddie thing... also good, because they belong together, too. However... I became disenchanted halfway through the first season, because I became mildly uncomfortable watching it with my kids. The story was too dramatic and soap-opera-y, and the characters were just wrong. Scooby would not have been jealous over Shaggy and Velma dating-- he'd've been happy for them! Velma and Shaggy dating was okay, except it was too much drama, and Velma turned into a crazy stalker. Daphne, by comparison, may have loved Fred, but she wasn't all suicidally obsessed with him like she was freaking Bella Swan, and Fred wasn't a complete freaking idiot.

4285881,5,B00487HQVW,"What a tremendous job they did with the newest incarnation of Scooby Doo, Mystery Incorporated.  The characters have really come to life and each adds something interesting to the team without demolishing the stuff that made the original versions great.  Their interactions are fast, fun, and amazingly charming; their conversations are always entertaining and sometimes become hilarious.

The technology is modern--cell phones, chat rooms, etc.--and the clothing is late 60's and yet it's done so seamlessly you never question it.  Heck, it's great to see the gang in their (pretty much) original costumes again.

The monsters are truly monstrous, but the writers keep to the tradition and have them all unmasked at the end.  (As an aside, I do not like Scooby Doo shows where the monsters wind up being real witches or aliens or whatever.  That's a personal preference; your mileage may vary.)  Also, the villains typically are used to poke some lighthearted fun at the conventions of the show.  One lady believes her son or daughter is slighted and so does ""what any mother with an advanced degree in robotics would do..."" Which is just awesome.  Oh, and the tried-and-true ""I would have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling kids,"" is parodied consistently through the episodes.

Inside jokes abound; there's a beach scene with the teenage versions of Bam-Bam and Pebbles rocking out Flintstone style.  And there are 2 characters from 90210 or some other 90's show that constantly show up to be terrorized by various monstrosities.  There's a statue of Scrappy Doo that makes Daphne shudder, and an equally horrified Fred puts his arm around her, leading her away, reminding her how they promised they'd never speak of that.  H.P Lovecraft--excuse me, Hatecraft--makes a few appearances as well.  Lots of fun.

Additionally, there are overarching storylines similar to something you might see on the X-Files concerning the original Mystery Incorporated Gang.  All in all, really just a magnificent effort, updating the franchise while remaining true to its spirit.  If you haven't seen it, you really should.",1331769600,3,2125,5.145772594752186

Now they're back in a brand-new series for fans old and new alike: ""Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated"".

Come join the gang as they tackle all-new mysteries in a seaside town called Crystal Cove as they track down a slime creature (""Beware the Beast from Below""), gator people (""The Creeping Creatures""), a spooky trucker (""Secret of the Ghost Rig""), and a human crab (""Revenge of the Man Crab"").  Of course, it's just gonna be someone in a very convincing disguise if you follow practically every mystery in the past with those ""meddling kids"", if you will.

Not much else to say about this DVD (even though I feel your pain for those of you wanting a season set), but there are a couple things about the series that puzzles me: one, the fact that Fred is acting a bit more trap-happy in the series despite Daphne trying to win him over; and two, the bizarre romantic relationship between Velma and Shaggy.  What's up with that ?

Ah, well, at least this series as well as new movies like ""Abracadabra-Doo"" and ""Camp Scare"" are faring nicely.

4285890,5,B00487HQVW,"I love this new take on Scooby-Doo, but understand why others would see the differences as shocking.

One of the most interesting new aspects of Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc. is the underlying mystery which provides greater depth to the show as each show helps builds upon the next one with small parts of the larger mystery slowly being revealed. In previous versions of Scooby-Doo it was rare for the other mysteries to be mentioned and very little looking back, which worked well for the original Scooby-Doo but also made going back and re-watching previous shows something to do just to re-watch, not to watch again for subtle plot points which might have been missed in the first viewing leading to better understanding of the characters and the larger mystery.

As to the romantic interests developing in the show others have mentioned, I actually think these new romances help to breathe more life and give more depth to the characters. In my opinion, within previous versions of Scooby-Doo Velma, for example, was a very smart girl and a interesting character but she was mainly to me the smart girl, friend of Daphne, Shaggy, Scooby, a bit of a klutz at times but nothing really to bring her more to life then that; this new version though with the romantic interest show to her character helps show more sides to her even hinting at possible darker side then previously shown and as a result works to bring far more life to her character.

Fred and Daphne's romance was always hinted at and lets none of us forget both boys and girls in high school and be rather oblivious to signals sent from the opposite sex as some of us might remember being ourselves in those days. So Daphne sending out massive hints and Fred being a bit dense about the signals does nothing to take away from his character for me and again helps to make him more real. His character is still the one who is crafty and intelligent with building the traps but with this added dimension to his character, like with Velma, more life is breathed to the character for me.

Overall an excellent new version of a classic that I think succeeds and honors the original series far more in putting its own mark on the classic characters within the classic series then it could ever by trying to copy the original, which with other versions in the past is where I think those versions have failed, trying too hard to be a precise copy of the classic.",1295654400,35,2415,4.6223776223776225
4285891,1,B00487HQVW,"I'd like to pick this up for my son, but he's going to have to wait, as should you.

Studios are increasingly catching on to the 'double dip' of multiple versions of the same product.  Extended vs. theatrical release is somewhat forgivable, but breaking up seasons into volumes is a blatant money-grab.

Basic points to skip this release:
The show is broadcast in HD -- an HD release is possible.*
This is an actively produced and re-fun show (you can 'tape it' and wait)
Unless you're chucking the case, this is going to take up more room in your collection than a full set will

If you honestly can't wait for this and don't care about possibly re-purchasing the same thing later, I doubt you'd be reading the reviews;  if you're on the fence, at least wait for a full season 1 release before purchasing.

4285892,5,B00487HQVW,"This is a great series, EXCEPT, like many others have stated, for the annoying Velma/Shaggy romance nonsense. Velma is a loner who does the thinking. Scooby and Shaggy are the best buddies who won't let ANYBODY, whether it's Velma or Angelina Jolie, get in between them.

They need to get back to the basics...the show's romantic elements make it look like Degrassi High or B.H. 90210. Keep the romance out of it and get back to the basics....a bunch of friends, try to solve mysteries, two of which (Scooby and Shaggy) always end up facing the adventure together, with plenty of good food, and scary monsters to keep them busy.

The series HAS featured these elements, but the romance has gotten in the way. Take the romantic nonsense out of it (Besides, Daphne is MY woman) and the show would be one of if not THE best Scooby Doo series' in history, right up there, with ""What's New, Scooby Doo?"".

I also agree: Release the ENTIRE Season, instead of this ""four episodes here, four episodes there"", junk, which is done to make the ""Volume price"" of $9.99 more attractive to the buyer than the ""Season price"" which would be about $25 to $30. Think about the fans of the show, instead of profits for a change.",1294617600,7,1209,4.587962962962963

8418574,5,B00487HQVW,Sooby-Doo is a 5 star because he's funny and likes to eat alot. I like it because Shaggy and Velma are girlfriend abd boyfriend and Shaggy has to keep it a secret from Scoobywitch is hard to do and is funny how they have to do it.
