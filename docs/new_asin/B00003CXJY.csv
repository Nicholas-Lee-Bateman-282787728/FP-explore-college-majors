1270216,5,B00003CXJY,"Blue Streak was a suprise hit to me last fall, Big Momma's House suprised  me this summer.  I laughed my astrodynamics off watching Martin Lawrence  dress up as BIG MOMMA (A 60 year old 400 pound lady)  Not only was  this a super funny movie, but a great story and excellent chemistry between  Nia Long and Martin.  Paul Giamatti, playing Lawrences FBI partner,  is just as funny as Martin when given the chance.  A few scenes stick out  in mind like when BIG MOMMA (lawrence) take self defense class and when BIG  MOMMA dunks over two other guys heads.  Non-stop laughing in this  one, go check it out--you're sure to like it.  --Star Wars on DVD--  Come  on Lucas!",960076800,15,666,4.470588235294118

1270435,4,B00003CXJY,"2000 brought the release of Big Momma's House starring Martin Lawrence at perhaps his comic best, directed by Raja Gosnell, and written by Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer.  Many accused Martin Lawrence of copying things off of Eddie Murphy's recent success of The Nutty Professor (the use of make up and prosthetics) to play multiple characters, and its blending of dramatics with comedy.  Yet, this was one of the funnier movies in recent years.

Martin Lawrence plays FBI agent Malcolm Turner who along with his partner John Maxwell (Paul Giamatti) have stumbled upon a unique opportunity.  While working another case, a convicted felon  Lester Vesco (Terrence Howard) has escaped from prison for armed robbery and murder.  They are staking out an older, heavyset black woman named Hattie Mae Pierce (Ella Mitchell; whom her friends call ""Big Momma"") in a small town in Georgia.  Lester's ex-girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) has fled once she heard of Lester's escape.  Believing that she may try to contact her estranged grandmother, Big Momma, Malcom and John await her arrival as she may know of where the money they stole in an armed robbery case is.  When Big Momma leaves town unexpectedly, Malcolm pretends that he is Big Momma on the phone in the hopes that Sherry will come to them.  A few days later, she arrives with her 10 year old son, and meets Malcolm posing in full Big Momma drag.  A series of screwball comedy antics unfold as Sherry and her son are trying to hide out and Malcolm tries to keep up appearances as Big Momma.

This is not a heavy drama, to be sure, but the comedy antics are rather hysterical as Martin Lawrence tries in vain to be something he isn't without letting his inner cop come out.  We have to set aside the fact that all are fooled by his prosthetic makeup into thinking that he actually is Big Momma.  Paul Giamatti offers his unique sense of awkward, weird guy in his interactions with the real Big Momma and trying to be a tough guy FBI agent, as well as Nolan (Anthony Anderson) trying to be his haphazard tough guy self when he is a happy, bumbling fool.  And it's a happy ending as all learn from it and the audience has a good laugh or two.  The only scene that wasn't received well was the bathroom humor scene, which is pretty gross, yet they have to push certain limits with the audience to get certain laughs and show that they have a certain edge.  It's a lot of fun and silly at times, but you need a silly movie once in a while to make you laugh.",1466467200,,2499,4.542410714285714

1270439,3,B00003CXJY,"This movie's a rip off of the movie stakeout, which came out in the 80's.
Every single plot point from that movie has been included here.
Even the characters are pretty much the same, with Martin Lawrence filling the role of Richard Dreyfuss and Paul Giamatti as Emilio Estevez's character.
The only thing they added is Martin Lawrence's character gets to play dress up and disguise himself as an old woman, other than that it's pretty much the same.
You can see the plot points coming a mile away.

SPOILER ALERT

The guy gets the girl, the bad guy goes down and they all live happily ever after.

1270869,5,B00003CXJY,"I got this for my mom as part of her Christmas gift. She loves this movie and kept talking about it so I thought it would be a great gift.

The movie stars Martin Lawrence as Malcolm Turner, an FBI agent, who goes undercover as Sherry Pierce's (Nia Long) Grandmother, Hattie Mae Pierce aka Big Momma. Sherry worked at a bank which her ex-boyfriend Lester robbed and she was thought to have given him the key to the bank. Malcolm and his FBI partner were sent to Georgia to stake out Big Momma's house in an attempt to capture Lester. Big Momma unexpectedly leaves town to help out a friend. Sherry decides to get away and visit her grandmother (not knowing her grandmother left), and when she calls the house Malcolm pretends to be her grandmother. The next morning Sherry arrives and Malcolm answers the door undercover as her grandmother.

This is a very funny movie. One that you can watch over and over and it never gets old. I promise you will not be disappointed!",1393372800,,969,4.5

1270871,1,B00003CXJY,"We were a captive audience for the screeening of this movie on a flight from Europe to the U.S.
This is the most boring movie I have seen in 25 years. The acting is poor. The script is poor. The editing
is poor. The movie is not funny. This movie is just stupid. It may appeal to a few youngsters and those
who are on drugs.",1387238400,,324,3.9242424242424243
1270872,5,B00003CXJY,"This movie has three distinct plots, not in order but overlaid with each other, intertwined with humor and timed to reach a belly-laughing and mind-blowing grand finale.  The plots are a comedy, a crime thriller and a serious love story.  A charming sub-plot involves a young boy's adjustment to developments in the love story.  The comedy centers around a real, 400 pound Big Momma (Ella Mitchell) and a fake Big Momma which is FBI agent Malcolm (Martin Lawrence)wearing an incredibly accurate and life-like fake Big Momma disguise.  Malcolm is intent on solving a major bank robbery crime and gets a lead that the thief's girlfriend Sherry (Nia Long) lives in a small Southern town across from the real Big Momma's home.  He learns that the real Big Momma will be out of town and decides that he and his assistant John (Paul Giamatti) should set up a stake-out in the real Big Momma's house across the street from Sherry's house, hoping that the thief will expose himself by visiting Sherry.  Malcolm also learns that Big Momma is close to Sherry, manages to hear and imitate Big Momma's voice, then dons the disguise as Big Momma and uses it to get close to Sherry.  This opens the possibility of a romance from Malcolm's side, but not from Sherry's perspective since she thinks she is talking to the real Big Momma.  This difficulty becomes comical and is made more comical by the ongoing friction-loaded and slapstick relationship that develops between Malcolm, who is creative and impulsive and John who is regulation-bound and filled with reservations concerning what could go wrong in their efforts. In time, Malcolm emerges from his disguise, allowing he and Sherry to fall in love.  The movie's ending reveals that Sherry has a son, who the son's father is, how the son acclimates to Malcolm's interest in his mother, who the thief is and where the money is hidden.  If you think endless belly laughs are essential to your health, see this one.",1380844800,,1954,4.823353293413174

1271137,3,B00003CXJY,"This isn't really Martin Lawrence's best work, but it's not his worst, either. It's very average, with both funny and unfunny jokes here and there. The premise is unoriginal, yes, but it's taken with some good hilarity. Everyone gives great performances, but some of their dialogue could have been improved. What I liked the most about Big Momma's House is the soundtrack (Lil Jon at his best!), and that's the only greater thing about this movie. So if you're into Martin Lawrence's work, then you'll probably love this 2000 comedy. If you want an excellent comedy, then you'll probably find this very adequate.",1255305600,,612,4.951456310679611

The F.B.I. believe that Sherri was involved, so Malcolm tries to get a confession, but he soon believes that Sherri is innocent and begins to fall in love with her. Malcolm gets into a lot of crazy situations as Big Momma like playing Basketball, delivering a baby, singing in church, and much more!

1271139,4,B00003CXJY,"When I read the comment at this site about the film, I spontaneously decided to add mine. We saw the film in a lesson of Business English - which seems quite odd - but I really enjoyed it. It was not as flat as I expected, actually it was really funny and romantic. I had not seen a film with Martin Lawrence before and found him really cude. Also his girlfriend ""Sherry"" is very sexy... And at last, the music was really good: The soundtrack met my favour and the gospel song ""happy day"": I could not sit quiet any longer... So my opinion about the film is much more positive: I think it's the right film to pass a nice video session with some chips and laughter!!!",1223510400,,666,4.2109375
1271140,3,B00003CXJY,"I'm sure Lawrence had the character before the story and worked the movie around it, and this is what it looks and feels like. Some funny scenes, but too many scenes that you know are going to happen(Aka. Lawrence disguised as Big Momma having an uncomfortable scene in bed with a beautiful lady that he happens to be attracted to as his FBI character, his emotional involvement with the women in the previous statement etc.) I had a hard time laughing at much of the movie because it was so predictable, and the one joke mentality that the movie started with(Lawrence disguised as an overweight straight-forward and rough African-american woman)doesn't make an entire movie.",1220918400,,675,4.9298245614035086

Martin Lawrence portrays the comedy to the hilt, and, surprisingly, he also does an good job of being a suave man pursuing his woman.  Nia Long is a beautiful and excellent actress in this film making the romance part so adorable.  Terrence Howard's role was done well too.  He really can be a scarey character when he needs to portray it.  Altogether this film is excellent on so many levels and a must see for anyone who likes the combination of action, romance and humor.",1186876800,,596,4.381818181818182

1271274,4,B00003CXJY,"Big Momma's House is far more entertaining than some of the reviews would indicate.  Yes, the plot is almost impossible:  an FBI agent who is forced to disguise himself as a very large grandmother, in order to track down an escaped killer.

But the film has so many enjoyable scenes.  Who can forget lovely Sherry (Nia Long), asking if Big Momma (Martin Lawrence) has another flashlight?  The makeup and body padding make Martin Lawrence an awesomely agile grandmother.  His basketball back-dunk is something we would all love to see grandmothers be able to do.  It's kind of like when we wish we had super powers.

I can't spoil it for you, because there are just so many memorable scenes:  like detective Malcolm caught in a tree branch as he slowly sags out of his ""granny suit.""  Or when he somersaults, breaking through the front window, shyly commenting, ""I forgot my keys.""  Or when the reverend (Cedric the Entertainer) discourages Big Momma from talking too much about what happened in the back of an El Camino.

OK--it's kind of kitsch--but it's a whole lot of fun.  It will not be considered the greatest movie of the twentyfirst century, but it is an escapist romantic comedy and lots of fun.

1271275,3,B00003CXJY,"I'm not usually a fan of movies in this genre, but Big Momma's House is not as bad a diversion as some might have you believe.  If you've ever witnessed someone doing or saying something so stupid,low and crass that you had to laugh in spite of yourself, then this movie fits the bill. One of the strongest draws of this movie is its unusually strong cast of talented actors, who make the most out of what they are given. Like most comedies in this vein, you have to suspend your disbelief much of the time:  the plot of this situational comedy is highly improbable, but sometimes quite funny. Martin Lawrence won't make you forget Eddie Murphy's star turn in the First ""Nutty Professor"" remake, but he does have some surprisingly amusing moments impersonating ""Big Momma"" while in pursuit of a criminal who is on the lam. Nia Long, his love interest, is as cool and ravishing as ever. Ella Mitchell gamely plays the real Big Momma and, best of all, Anthony Anderson is uproariously funny as a bumbling security guard who moonlights giving self-defense classes to elderly women in the neighborhood community center.  As most reviewers here have indicated, ""Big Momma's House"" is definitely not worth agonizing about.  It's the film equivalent of pleasantly disposable junk food.  It could have been much worse.",1157241600,3,1310,4.830357142857143

1271401,2,B00003CXJY,"Big Momma's House was a huge hit for Fox Studios, which had gone through a yearlong dry spell. Much of the reason for its success is that Hollywood has finally realized that there is a big urban market, composed mainly of young Afro-Americans, with plenty of disposable income and an obvious fondness for movies. What the industry may not know is that the novelty of having more movies aimed towards this audience will wear off. When this happens, the product will need to improve. Take Big Momma's House as an example. If it had had mainly a white cast and starred Robin Williams, it probably would have died after its opening weekend. Different audience groups vary in what they think is funny, but lazy movie making such as this effort eventually ends up discouraging the intended target.
Martin Lawrence is Malcolm, a FBI agent whose skills include impersonating people. Nolan [Anthony Anderson] is a dangerous criminal who has just escaped from prison. The Feds assume he will head for the $2,000,000 he stole in his last heist. His old girlfriend Sherry [Nia Long] is put under surveillance because she may or may not know where the money is. Before they can properly stake her out, Sherry flees to Georgia with her young son. Malcolm and his partner are assigned to follow her. They think she is going to her grandmother's house. Before Sherry can contact Big Momma, the woman leaves town. Malcolm decides to impersonate her. Sherry winds up believing Malcolm is Big Momma, Malcolm falls for Sherry, and the movie gets progressively sillier.
Seeing a man dressed as a woman is not in itself necessarily inherently funny. The humor resides in how the man reacts to being in this role, as in his getting accustomed to such attire and in his discovery that his feminine side is starting to show. Great examples of this are Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor and Robin Williams in Mrs. Doubtfire. In those movies, it was necessary for the actors to be convincing because the story depended on it. The plot of Big Momma's House also requires believability, But Martin Lawrence seems uncomfortable in his role. He often contorts his face and rolls his eyes as if to say to the audience that he is really a man. The audience knows this, and his tentative approach to being Big Momma becomes irritating.
The people who wrote this movie should learn that, while humor can be crude, all things crude are not humorous. There is a scene near the beginning that takes bathroom humor to a new low, not that it was very high to begin with. I am not at all a prude. I realize we live in times which are basically wide open. I simply didn't find the scene amusing. Of course, I didn't find much of the movie to be that funny.",1016409600,2,2743,4.657731958762887

Yes this is one of those movies that is not only heavily reliant on fat jokes and toilet humour but almost revels in them.  The humour is tacky and dull whilst the romantic subtext is tired.

1271520,3,B00003CXJY,"In ""Big Momma's House,"" Martin Lawrence goes the ""Some Like it Hot/Tootsie/Mrs. Doubtfire"" route, dressing up in drag and embroiling himself in a mess of plot complications - just as Jack Lemmon, Tony Curtis, Dustin Hoffman, Robin Williams and a whole host of other comic actors have done before him.  This is practically a rite of passage for any movie comedian, harking back to a tradition that is as old as drama itself.  You really can't go too wrong with this cross dressing scenario, particularly if you happen to have a talented comic actor buried under all the makeup.  Luckily, this is the case here.  ""Big Momma's House"" may be far from original in its premise and execution, but the film does manage to deliver its fair share of laughs - enough, at least, to justify giving it a once-over if you happen to be in the mood for some undemanding, mindless entertainment.
In terms of the setup, this film fails to deliver even the modicum of credibility that distinguished its predecessors.  This is mostly due to the fact that, in the previous films, the men in drag were portraying characters no one in the film had ever met before.  Lawrence, on the other hand, is playing the part of an undercover FBI agent who dresses up and passes himself off as a figure named Big Momma who is a well-known person in her family and in her neighborhood.  That he is able to bamboozle all these friends, family members and acquaintances into believing he is indeed Big Momma does require us to suspend our disbelief even more than usual with a story of this type.
Be that as it may, the truth is that ""Big Momma's House"" is a fun, fast moving and enjoyable little comedy, due, in no small measure, to Lawrence's skill in bringing the character to life through the expert use of vocal inflections, facial expressions and mannerisms.  The script relies on some fairly conventional slapstick routines involving split second near-misses as well as dialogue that ranges from the clever and sassy to the crude and vulgar.  Still, in comparison to the truly raunchy ""Nutty Professor II,"" ""Big Momma's House"" seems like a genteel Sunday school picnic.
""Big Momma's House"" certainly doesn't rank up there with the classics of the genre - ""Tootsie"" or  ""Some Like it Hot"" - but it does get the job done, which is more than can be said for lots of other comedies these days.",999907200,,2358,4.673913043478261
1271521,1,B00003CXJY,"Someone explain to me why Martin Lawrence gets paid as a 'Top Dog"" to be featured in any film, short film or disastrous FOX sitcom?  Just because you personally know Eddie Murphy isn't an excuse, but apparently, Martin has made a living at doing it.
It makes a man angry (me and you...even if you're a woman) when you see Martin Lawrence on screen without a semblance of talent...and you realize he's making about eight times what you make.
After the first fourteen minutes of this film, I figured out a fun game to play:  Count how many times you hear the two words BIG and Momma.  Everyone says it throughout this [...] tale without substance or heart.  It's incredibly annoying, believe me.
This film is a disgrace to the intelligence of blacks and whites as nobody realizes that the real Big Momma isn't the one that's being displayed throughout the agonizing hour and a half plus of this film.  How could ANY of these people not know the difference?
The basketball scene is a complete disgrace considering Mah-Tin stands about 5'2"" to begin with.  He dunks with about 100 pounds of flop and make-up on his body?  Oh Lord...it's really that bad.
Save yourself a few good hours of the life you have on this Earth and don't watch this complete and total sham of a film.  It doesn not possess one redeeming quality to it....and the only reason it gets one star is because [I have] to give it that, as the minimum.

Some good laughs, but doesn't come close to Mrs. Doubtfire or Tootsie.  I was expecting the DVD to only have a trailer or something, but to my surprise the DVD has some good features.  They include:  deleted scenes with commentary, outtakes and bloopers, a documentary, feature-length director/producer commentary, 2 music videos, a makeup test, and some trailers and TV spots.  If you like the Tootsie rip-offs, then you should like this movie, but if you don't dig it, stick with Mrs. Doubtfire.",977356800,,717,4.788617886178862
1271770,3,B00003CXJY,"This movie was highly entertaining, but I would not call it hilarious.
The plot is rather simple and lacks originality.  Martin Lawrence, who is an agent in the FBI, impersonates an obese grandmother in attempts to capture a robbery suspect.  There isn't anything more to say about the plot.
Parts of the movie I did find hilarious.  Three scenes I enjoyed was him delivering a baby while posing as the grandma, the grandma and her grandson teaming up to play a little two on two basketball with some kids, and the grandma in self defense class.
This movie reminded me a lot of Mrs. Doubtfire (if you liked that movie, you will also like this one).  I definitely found the movie entertaining and is worth seeing.  However, if you don't see this one, it is not the end of the world.",977270400,,781,4.51063829787234
1271771,5,B00003CXJY,"Man, Martin Lawrence is a Comical genius.  I thoroughly enjoyed Blue Streak and Life, but i laughed harder in this movie than i think i ever have!  The way he portrays an obese southern african american lady is so funny.  The cooking is hysterical, and the romance between him and the girl is interesting.  I reccomend this to anyone who could understand all of the great humor in it, even though sometimes it is crude.",977184000,,419,4.546666666666667
1271772,1,B00003CXJY,"The summer of 2000 will be remembered for being the summer of movies that did not make us laugh. Sure there were some exceptions, but there also were two films that made us realize that unfunny comedians get paid way too much in this country. The first black eye to comedies was that of nutty professor II. a painfully unfunny film that featured an ego maniac (eddie murphy) in 6 different roles, many of them in ""fat suits"". come on eddie, you need a ""fat suit"" to get laughs.  then comes Martin Lawrence. another comedian with a complex, this one not so much with his ego, but the thought that everything he does is funny to everyone. well, truth be told, you are only funny to yourself Martin.  does anyone realize that someone does not need to have a funny costume on to get laughs. real comedy is made with situations and clever dialogue. comedy needs to come from those that are truly funny, not those that get paid way to much to annoy us with the same formulaic jokes that we have seen over and over again. I think i speak for many of Americans when i say that Martin and Eddie owe some of us some money for having to watch these painfully unfunny films",976924800,4,1161,4.345622119815668
1271773,4,B00003CXJY,"Not Martin's best work, but it was truly enjoyable. I guess that I'm still stuck in the BAD BOYS mode wishing those two would hook up again and do a sequel. This movie was one for the rental list, but I'm not sure that it will actually buy it for the home library. Funny, entertaining, but lacking the TRUE Lawrence flair!",976233600,,322,4.295081967213115
1271774,1,B00003CXJY,"Fortunately for me, I waited til this total waste of film, and time on my part, was on video before viewing.  I am not even a fan of Martin Lawrence.  I did like Blue Streak, but only because the charming Luke Wilson was in it.  I don't think Lawrence has alot of comedic talent.  I have to admit there are a few, very few rare momments of Martin Lawrence that I actually consider funny.  And maybe one of them was in this film.  Blue Streak was a much better movie and story.  I am a fan of some of the older, much more funny comedies that involve men dressing up like women for whatever reason.  SOME LIKE IT HOT & TOOTSIE are probably the best of the bunch. Plus, how many times can bathroom humor be funny?  It's getting old. This waste of time has maybe two or three funny parts, and the rest is just totally stupid.  The ending was totally predictable.  I think that Martin Lawrence should maybe hangup his fat suit and go back to t.v.",975283200,,941,4.201117318435754
1271775,5,B00003CXJY,"I love Martin Lawrence as an actor and comedian.  This movie was soooo funny.... Great movie if you want a good laugh.  I didn't think he could be funny after Blue Streak.  But yes he was.  You go Martin, you're my favorite.",973728000,3,224,4.261904761904762
1271904,5,B00003CXJY,This Movie is the bomb!  This movies is very funny. If you all have or had a big momma you know what to expect. This is one of the best movies Martin  have done beside Blue Streak. You Go Boy!,969235200,,192,3.775
1271905,4,B00003CXJY,This movie is a pretty good movie with great characters. Martin Lawrence does a good job as two characters and being funny. Camera work is great as  is editing. The only bad part is a few plot holes at the end. It's nice  that about 15 minutes of the movie takes place in a church since you don't  really see that often these days...,968976000,,333,4.171875
1271906,5,B00003CXJY,This movie was one of the best movies of his career. Blue Streak was number one in my book. If you want a good laugh you need to rent or even  buy it. Keep up the good work Martin.,968889600,,180,3.6153846153846154

1271908,1,B00003CXJY,"Ok, this will not be a film review, per se, more of a confession on my part: yes, I have seen Big Momma's House.  Shoot me now for I have come  forward!  My only saving grace is that I got in for student price.  You  thought I'd say I liked it?  I didn't.
  There are many, many reasons  how and why we ended up watching this, but I won't bore you with that here.
  Pic features a one Martin Lawrence, who was amusing in Nothing to  Lose with nice Tim Robbins, getting dressed up in drag and makeup and  pretending to be the Big Momma in question.  Oh, how we laughed!  Or not,  as the case may be.  Sure, there were some laughs here and there.  ALL  placed within the first half hour of the film.  We then peter out into a  mess of, er, um, unfunny tripe.
  Film ends in the worst possible way:  a big coming-of-age / revelation / spiritual awaking type deal in a big  church sing song.  Please, kill me now.
  Most enjoyable part of the  flicker: eating Haagan-Daaz Cookie Dough iced cream during the trailers.  True Story.",964656000,,1025,4.1875
1271909,1,B00003CXJY,"I was looking foward to seeing this funny looking movie when it turned out I had already seen the jokes in the trailer preview. This movie got unfunny  extremely quickly. Instead of paying money to see the jokes, watch the  trailer instead cos they're all there. The only highlight was Martin  Lawrence who is a brilliant actor but he did better in 'Nothing To Lose'  which is the kind of movie to see for laughs. Utterly Disapointed",963360000,,433,4.584415584415584
1271910,1,B00003CXJY,"The trailer made this movie look extremly funny. Its nothing short of a  Tootsie rip off. It plays just like it and that makes it so predictable. It  tries to hard to be funny and touching. Someone who is young or not  familair with Tootsie or any other comedy of that nature might like it.  Very bad, i would never recommend to anyone.",962150400,,336,4.285714285714286
1271911,2,B00003CXJY,"I'll put aside my distate for the plot, acting, and utter cliched nature  of this film to talk about what's really important: the rating.
This  movie has no business being rated pg-13. Occurences of 'damn,' 'ass,'  'shit,' and other profantiy are profuse. Sexual inuendos are rampant... ala  ""Big Momma... do you have another flashlight down there?""
Now,  I'm not a right-wing radical. I do enjoy movies and am not for censorship  at all. I don't object to profanity in general, just when it's in a movie  that's been advertised as if it's a fun children's movie like ""The  Nutty Professor,"" of which it has 'borrowed' so greatly  from.
Parents, you might a few laughs out of this one, I just strongly  suggest that you preview it before taking your kids to see it.",961200000,,765,4.684210526315789
1271912,2,B00003CXJY,"You've seen them: Mrs. Doubtfire, Some Like It Hot, and now Big Momma.  Of  course, there's tons of others where the whole movie is revolved around  morons dressing up as women.  Morons being men.
Big Momma's House is that  kind of movie with a Martin Lawrence twist on it.  Only it's more to  protect a fine woman from being killed by her criminal ex.  She has a son  as well.
This movie has lots of loopholes in it, and just the stupidity  of it.  No woman would go for someone who dressed up as their mother and  thought she was a theif, and then she would make love to that person in a  church.
Of course, there's too many crotch, giant butt, or giant breast  in the face jokes, but it's still a little funny.  Blue Streak was funnier,  though.  That's the Martin Lawrence movie.
This is the mindless,  tasteless entertainment people manage to enjoy.  This is fluff for a good  time, if there's nothing else to really see at the theatre.  Most of it is  repeated material, too.  Not badly directed, though.  Recommended for  mindless entertainment.",961027200,,1052,4.497326203208556
