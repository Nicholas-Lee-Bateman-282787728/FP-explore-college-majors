855563,5,6304288115,"This is an excellent program in a series done by Finley-Holiday Film Corp. It is a perfect keepsake for anyone who has visited Monticello or intends to visit Jefferson's home. It also is of interest to anyone who loves history.  It has interior views of the home which visitors are unable to take themselves since no interior home photos are allowed. I have purchased the Shenandoah film previously and this too was excellent.

I would recommend this series if all the others are at the quality and depth of the two I now own.",1254182400,9,526,4.585106382978723

7869255,4,6304288115,"The color and pictures were clear and great, the background music was too loud and this DVD hinted that Thomas Jefferson had black relatives from the slaves.  I was disappointed that this video did not have information  on a study that was done with five diverse people who all had different political backgrounds. Bob Turner who is with U.VA. was one of the five participants involved in this study.  These five people came to the conclusion Thomas Jefferson did not have any relations with the slaves it was his brother because his brother use to mingle with them.  Bob Turner spoke at an event I had in 2011 and his credentials are stellar.  I think the people who did the video should have been more objective regarding Thomas Jefferson's relatives and should have investigated more to see if there was any evidence which was contrary to what they believed.",1399248000,2,861,4.751677852348993
