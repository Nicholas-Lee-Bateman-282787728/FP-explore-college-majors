I was very angry when ""Jesse"" got cancelled also. I would think that an actress of Christina's caliber would be getting more leading roles in high bugget productions. I must be missing something?

1089129,1,6305837481,"The actual plot of this movie was not that bad, but the casting and dialogue really destroyed any chance this movie had for being watchable.  Christina Applegate is a good actress, but she has a very small role. The  storyline strayed here and there and never successfully satisfied the  viewer's curiosity. The only aspect that kept my interest was Moon Unit  Zappa's performance, as a quick-witted and lonely lesbian. If you like Moon  Zappa, get the movie; otherwise, save your money, and your time.",966729600,23,502,4.928571428571429
1089314,4,6305837481,"It's a pretty good drama that deserves a higher rating. It should not have been advertised as a thriller, which I think is the reason for at least some of the bad reviews. Putting Christina Applegate on the cover was also a bad idea. As others have said, she's not really in the movie much at all. But it's a solid story and the actors pull it off. The understated mystery and light dark comedy plays with the tension to create an intermittently brooding atmosphere that weakly builds up to a satisfying ending. Give it a try.",1480377600,2,526,4.43298969072165
1089315,1,6305837481,"One of the worst movies I've ever wasted my time on (the other was Nurse, another Amazon Prime freebie).  Contrived ""plot"", assuming you can even come to the conclusion that it had a plot, awful acting, amateurish production, and writing that was all over the place.  Midway through the movie seemed to have a crisis identity and it seemed to suddenly try to be more of a teen comedy, resulting in two stoners kidnapping a blind man's god and killing it.  Hilarious, right?  As others have mentioned Christina Applegate had the smallest of parts in this movie and spends the least of time on screen of all the characters; who, by the way, are the most annoying collection of morons I've ever had to endure in a single flick.  I was hoping and praying about 20 minutes in that a serial killer would show up and slaughter them all, but no such luck.  At the end of the day someone could have taken this generic idea and made a worthwhile flick out of it, but as it is this was a total disaster.  I now know what happened to Molly Ringwald's career - she took a part in this movie and it completely killed it off.  The producer seemed to even know that there was no chance the audience would feel what we were supposed to when we were supposed to, so the movie seems to CONSTANTLY have (bad) background music and songs playing in order to give us cues that ""Now you're supposed to feel happy; now you're supposed to feel sad; now you're supposed to be touched"".  I really can't say enough bad things about this movie.  Avoid at all costs.",1479945600,,1535,4.392226148409894

Christina Applegate has like 2 sentences of dialogue, and Molly Ringwall is stuck in the background except for a couple of scenes.  The rest of the cast are ok, but I thought the actoress playing Vanilla was really good.

The story is about a bunch of young adult friends coming together for the weekend after going their own ways for a few years.  Everyone seems to have a problem, but the main problem that ""ties"" the movie together is annoyingly hinted at through the movie.  The rest of the cast have issues that aren't related to the big problem, or that are small and petty.  It's just a disjointed mess.",1466899200,,672,4.467213114754099

1089720,2,6305837481,"There is a good cinematic idea lurking in ""The Brutal Truth"" (Moonstone/Alliance Atlantis 22399 being the North American edition viewed), a film also known by titles ""The Giving Tree"" or ""Shaded Places"". Emily invites friends, all connected with herself and mostly (though not entirely) with each other, to her relatively remote home in Southern California's backcountry. Emily finally appears, only to hang herself on the rope of her childhood swing. A rather strong earthquake strikes, leaving the friends stranded at her house.

The friends, while trying to cope with a corpse that cannot be disposed of normally due to telephone service outage, short supplies, absence of the small town's sheriff and coroner, etc., fall to reminiscing among each other in various pairings and groups. Some very ugly truths, most often of a sexual nature, emerge about each other, in large part connected, too, with now dead Emily. Many flashbacks occur to their own and to Emily's respective pasts.

There are numerous movies with plots similar to this one; for example, one vaguely on the theme is ""Tabou"", starring Nick Stahl among its cast, but that one leaves loads of corpses in its wake, not just one! This movie, however, is not even in the league of ""Tabou"", which, for its part, is no masterpiece, either, but that one exerts more fascination, at least, on the viewer than ""Brutal Truth"" does so.

Hamstringing the potential of ""The Brutal Truth"" is an ailing script with banal dialogue, confusing sequence of actions, some flashbacks which sometimes do not convey information clearly enough about Emily's friends and her past (or which at other times are too trivial), frequent lulls in pacing, use of music that sometimes stalls the film unduly, hammy acting, and much more. The whole film, which definitely is not one of director Cameron Thor's better cinematic endeavours, just sort of lurches, lopes, and stumbles along erratically from beginning to end.

This one is for keeps in this viewer's collection only really due to the presence of Jonathon Schaech, a favourite actor (memorable especially for taking part in that rock music movie classic, ""That Thing You Do""), who is  in the cast of ""The Brutal Truth"". Another asset is the natural loveliness of the California setting, the camera work capturing it very beautifully. Most movie lovers, however, probably can do without this motion picture at all.",1414281600,2,2409,5.104060913705584

1089831,1,6305837481,"The film is divided into two parts. In the first part Emily has a great relationship with a swing. A group of friends have a reunion at a country home which Emily invites them to. Then Emily has a bad relationship with a swing and the group becomes isolated due to the earthquake that happened at the same time. They examine their lives and ignore the gorilla in the living room, i.e. the reason why Emily had a bad relationship with the rope of the swing.

The dialouge bored me as did the soundtrack and the lame narration at the beginning of the film. If anything, it was funny to watch good actors struggle with a lousy role and lines. Worthy of a pass. The flashback scene was stupid. They could have done a far better job.

I rather enjoyed it, I really liked Molly Ringwald's icy, chain-smoking character. Yeah, I agree, a few too many ""flashbacks"", and a little slow, but you all act like you've never actually SEEN a BAD movie before. Truly BAD movies you don't even finish watching, no matter your liking for an actor or not. I've seen countless BAD movies, and sorry folks, but this ain't one of 'em. Give it a little credit. It's NOT that bad. No, not even close to award-worthy, but not as bad as you all're saying. Yes, the rape scenes were a bit brutal, but I've seen 1000 times worse in VERY good films. The Brutal Truth was a good film I'd watch again - I very much enjoyed watching it last night. I liked the story & found it a little original - it had a lot more potential than the film showed, but still worth watching.

1089833,1,6305837481,"If you're a stoner, you may enjoy this week-end cabin flopping, never-ending drone of apparently a half-dozen out-of-work actors who clearly had nothing else better to do but to transcript one of their pot-head boring parties.  It was one of those few misconceived independent film attempts that is amateurish on every level, and I couldn't fast-forward through it fast enough.  All the while I was watching it, I was hoping Christina Applegate (Married with Children fame) would come in and save this story.  But she only shows in a disappointing series of short  flashbacks, except for her terrorized cameo roll toward the end that she performed near perfection.  In a short while, you quickly hope this film transforms into another teen hatchet picture---if only to halt the harangues.

1089834,1,6305837481,"If you liked THE BIG CHILL, you probably won't like THE BRUTAL TRUTH.  Trying to set the same kind of mood as the CHILL, TRUTH offers us characters that are hardly likeable, a slow moving and banal plot, and acting that should make the actors responsible feel very embarrassed.  The writer tries to make Emily (Christina Applegate in a very small role) appear to be some kind of saint who changes everyone's life she touches.  The big ""secret"" is hardly that devastating for Emily, but one of her friends is pregnant with a baby that was the result of a brutal rape.  The movie has about a dozen worthless songs that they keep putting in, along with mood shots of the reflective actors.  Johnathon Schaech (Judas, The Forsaken) appears as some writer who ends up narrating the story, with a really coy and ridiculous ending.  Moon Zappa appears as a lesbian, and the other actors merely go through the motions.
