5344113,5,B009JVQ4KG,"This movie is fun to watch and sort of reminiscent to Disney's ""Midvale"" movies of an earlier time.  The movie is new to me and somewhat different than I might have expected based on the title.  It is a great light-hearted movie to watch.",1401062400,,238,4.386363636363637
5344114,5,B009JVQ4KG,"""The Ghosts of Buxley Hall"" is a very funny movie.  Excellent.  The actors that portrayed the ghosts were the right choice.  I shall enjoy watching this movie over & over again.",1394064000,2,177,4.645161290322581
5344115,3,B009JVQ4KG,"Buxley Hall is a military academy with few students and even fewer teachers.  In desperate need of cash, they reluctantly, begrudgingly join forces with a girl's school in a similar situation.  Into this muddle of clashing attitudes  arrives a rich boy that everyone assumes is their saving grace, as long as they can keep him happy, keep him at the academy.  Naturally, there are conflicting agendas at work.  The bank wants to foreclose, the boy's penniless aunt wants his money and will gladly get it dead or alive, her rarely seen brother is the boy's legal guardian (for the time being), and lastly the head of the academy (Monte Markham) just wants the boy enrolled because he could lead to an endowment of sorts.  There are three ghosts; two are opposed to females on the premises.  Along the way there's a pillow fight, sexist remarks, mice, an impromptu boxing match, no end of conniving on everyone's part, and the penniless aunt manages to buy the academy with no money, seeking to demolish it with all in attendance.  The humor is broad (from a pie in the face to a b-zillion double-takes).  You can tell it was a made-for-TV movie by the way it's pasted together (lots of abrupt blackouts where the commercials were awkwardly placed).  It's not high art but it has a few fun moments and manages to stay lively thanks in large part to Victor French's performance.",1376870400,4,1375,4.7154811715481175

8542303,4,B009JVQ4KG,one of the best movie of the week type of movie from the wonderful world of Disney There are quite a few movies like this of Disney that should be remade as well as sequels to There was one can't remember the title it dealt with a boy who left his body while staying with a old man in the woods and possessed a wolf. I also think that also could use a sequel or even a remake.,1528848000,,376,3.8333333333333335
