7820268,2,630202370X,I just couldn't get into this movie. The acting was very bad. This movie just didn't do it for me. Not very good at all.,1511222400,,120,3.84
7820269,2,630202370X,"Let me see where I want to start with this one...

Pros -
Concept / Idea is great
Entertainment-wise it was ""o...k...""
Sound quality was decent

Cons -
Acting was mediocre at best
Camera work was mediocre at best
Special Effects were ""meh..."" ( kinda reminded me of like TV Show A-Team special effects )

MAJOR flaws -
I hate when movies don't live within the confines of their own imagination...  For one, vampire powers are not clearly defined in this flick...  apparently they can go out in the sun...  and apparently getting a wooden splinter in the leg can cause death...  Beyond that, they can sometimes move at the speed of light, while in others they appear to run as slow as a turtle...  Beyond that, sometimes they can catch bullets and throw them back faster than a gun can fire them, while in others they get shot up left and right ( and it really hurts )...

It just makes no sense how in some scenes a single vampire can slaughter and entire platoon in seconds, while in other scenes they are pinned down ( as if helpless ) by a handful of guys shooting at them...

Either the vampires are super fast / nearly invincible or they aren't...  the movie never seemed to make up its mind...

If a movie defines some bizarro laws of physics / science...  fine, I can accept that, provided that the movie stays within its own laws...  But you can't just make them up / change them as you go...

( Side note...  I don't think I ever saw what our protagonists were feeding on...  I guess they don't have to eat at all?  I dunno... )

So...  poor movie overall, and I wouldn't recommend...  but I suspect vampire fans may want to watch anyway...",1510704000,2,1649,4.376237623762377

This film (Along with ""Trick or Treat"" & ""Killer Clowns from Outer Space"") was one of the few that we could watch umpteen times without getting sick of it.

It may have been the ""implied"" vampirism, as we were big horror fans, or just that at the time we were into war films (""Platoon"", ""Jacob's Ladder"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", that sort of thing) .",1386201600,,522,4.262626262626263

7820273,2,630202370X,"Lost platoon I thought was a LOST BOYS/NEAR DARK/PLATOON type of movie. The concepts are somewhat there, the actors are not though. The acting is very bad, the production ... there's not much blood for a movie that's suppose to be compared to Platoon. It has a good concept but it could have been done a hundred times better...I found it very boring. Some like some may not. This is one person who did not like it.",1037404800,3,414,4.3896103896103895
7820274,4,630202370X,"This is a truly different vampire film.  The premise is there is a platoon of vampire soldiers that travel from war to war, century to century, tipping the scales of wars in the name of defeating evil.  In the movie this platoon is trying to tip the scales for the greater good in the civil war in Nicaragua.  They meet up with a reporter who last crossed paths with them when he was a soldier in World War 2.  We eventually learn that they had saved his life in that war and continue to keep him alive in this one as they battle the evil dictator and his deranged lady love who are at the heart of the problem.  The movie itself is worth watching although by no means what one would call a polished production by anybody's definition of the word.  For diehard fans of vampire films this is one that shouldn't be missed.  At least it's a completely different story line than the usual worn out themes of the vampire cinema.  Vampires using their powers for the good of mankind . . . what a concept!",1028160000,7,998,4.2712765957446805
