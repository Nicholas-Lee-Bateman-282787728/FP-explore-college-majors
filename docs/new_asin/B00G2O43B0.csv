6045152,4,B00G2O43B0,"An entertaining story about the New York accent and ""Knishes"", a popular New York food brought over by Eastern European Jewish Immigrants, and how the two show what it means to be a ""typical New Yorker"".  This is a nice twist on the theme of life as a New Yorker, told by celebrities and everyday denizens alike.  The flow of this film is erratic and it sometimes wanders into tangents, but that is part of the charm.  It is truly fun to watch if you love New York and especially if you have an interest in its neighborhoods and the Jewish people from there.  My husband is from Long Island (Lawn Guyland), and enjoyed this tremendously.",1422748800,3,637,4.4655172413793105

6045157,5,B00G2O43B0,Great Documentary.  Well made.  Entertaining and easy to watch.  I watched it while eating cereal.  It's that easy.  Try it with other foods.  It's probably just as easy.,1388016000,5,170,4.892857142857143
6045158,5,B00G2O43B0,I recently moved to NYC.  There are so many accents here.  This movie help me understand them and what they are all about.  Heather did a great job on this film!,1387411200,2,161,4.129032258064516
6045159,5,B00G2O43B0,We loved hearing the stories from the people who lived there at a time when NY was still affordable to everyone. We passed the video along to a friend who grew up in Brooklyn. He was thrilled to with it!,1386460800,4,203,4.1
6045160,5,B00G2O43B0,"I'm from New York (Brooklyn, Queens and Lawgylind) and now live in Portland OR.  I haven't lived in NY for at least two decades and yet I speak like I just left there last week but I have managed to slow my speech down when I talk to people as they may not understand me.  I laughed throughout this documentary and my favorite people in the interviews were the Korean guy from Staten Island and the man who spoke in sign language.  I also was very happy to see the great scenic photography of the city which brought back so many memories.  I have maintained throughout my life  since I left NY that I don't have an accent and that people who listen to me have hearing problems!...lol  This documentary is fun and well worth seeing and most especially, listening.  btw there is a neighborhood in Portland OR called Brooklyn.  Now that's even funnier.",1383523200,14,849,4.467532467532467

6045167,5,B00G2O43B0,Very interesting.  I've been told by a speech specialist that the New York accent makes people use more facial muscles and thereby people from this area have better facial muscle tone.  Accent does matter.,1485561600,,205,5.0

Film basically justifies why some individuals speak the way they do and encourages the proliferation of slangs or dialects that will perpetuate the general classification of New Yorkers as ""stupid,"" ""ghetto,"" or ""uncultured.""

6045234,2,B00G2O43B0,"Much of this movie is fairly informative and entertaining but other parts are rubbish.  I won't go into extreme detail but suffice it to say, the movie's fatal flaw is mistaking cursing for a New York accent.  The endless scenes of the Italians eating dinner, drinking wine and cussing over and over is pointless and not entertaining.  You could go to any part of the USA and find people cussing in a very similar way.  The patterns of speech, the intrusive R sound, the inclusion of foreign words brought by each wave of immigrants are what make the New York accent what it is.  I would say that there are about 20 minutes worth of good movie here, stretched to its playing time by adding the uninteresting banter of unintelligent types to create a pseudo-artistic effect.",1451952000,,773,4.654411764705882
6045235,1,B00G2O43B0,"Maybe if you're a nostalgic New Yorker, this might resonate, but it views like someone swept up the cutting room floor and someone's kid spliced all the pieces together to see what would happen. This is a confused, muddled paean to New York, but it's not about the dialect, although it revisits that theme periodically, sort of like when you realize you are falling asleep in a lecture and you jerk yourself awake for a minute before you start to drift off again. This is a little about the dialect, a little about the boroughs, a little about the history, but mostly about various New Yorkers waxing nostalgic about the lost wonders of their youth, which is not only uninformative and uninteresting, but also unrevealing since you would get the same wistful sense of longing talking to people from Cleveland about the golden days of their youth.

Like it or hate it, this is really not well done. Maybe, just maybe the problem is that the narration keeps interrupting itself before it ever completes a coherent thought, so in that sense, it would be, according to Dershowitz, quintessentially of the New York vernacular.",1450483200,,1121,4.808290155440415

6045239,5,B00G2O43B0,"Powerful ending to what starts off as a documentary about the linguistics of the NYC accent-through conversations the art of language mirrors some of the current issues NYC faces-a gem. The conclusions seem to evolve as the movie , i.e. film for the PC in the audience and not from NYC ( excepting the upper west side colony ), quite naturally . The lack of contrivance struck me-so while I wish there were more interviews, I stand by the 5 stars. This Brooklyn American highly recommends this movie no matter from where you hail.

When I was in London, I was shocked to learn that my accent was not only cute, but downright sexy. Go figure.

It was not produced all that great and some of the footage and interviews were a little less than perfect-and that's being nice. (Now that I see Penny Marshall was credited as producer? Director?) I removed one star. The production should have been much better if this was her piece. The positives were... it didn't run too long (just about, or a little over an hour) very manageable.

No. But if you've got time to kill and are stuck for something to watch, need a good chuckle and you like documentaries, that I say give this one a spin.",1444953600,3,678,4.520325203252033

6045266,5,B00G2O43B0,"Regional accents will continue to evolve and the heart and soul is from cultural influences from immigrants but in the new millennia it has changed. I think the big complaints from people are not the influx of immigrants but other Americans who relocate from other parts of the country to gentrify and don't add to ""the flavor"" of cities and want ""whitewashed"" experiences and commercialized neighborhoods. This, along with the downtrend of the neighborhood business has gutted the soul and uniqueness of many cities.

This is the direct result of globalization, e-commerce, and the explosion and influence of massively available information on the internet. I traveled around Europe in 1998 and then in 2014 and it was like two different worlds. The uniqueness was a little gone from each country, the languages and food were different in each but the global influence was there; from clothing, music, large chain stores, to even slang/jargon.

Everyone says the homogenization of the world is inevitable and leads to unity and peace but I see it as sad, dystopian, and soulless.

6045272,3,B00G2O43B0,"As a former New Yorker,  I watched this from a unique perspective.  Further, having taken  undergraduate courses in linguistics this documentary would be beneficial for such a class.  However, the filter on obscene language was lacking.  When I grew up in New York people that used obscene language would do so with a filter.  For example out of respect for your elders and for youth the use of coarse language was limited.  Some of these scenes using the f word and the like were not necessary to make the point.  In fact I could have done without it because it was only used in private or close-knit conversations among peers only.  This use of indiscriminate f word was probably because the guy they were interviewing was drunk.  That sort of language usually was reserved for bars etc.  I did not find it terribly entertaining but it was interesting to see how the city has changed since I lived there.  It sounds like NY is just getting better but the old drunks do not think so.  They complain you can't just smoke on the streets anymore. I think that is a good thing!",1443225600,,1074,4.53125

There was extremely scant material involving the ""Story of the New York Accent"" covered in this blurb of a video. Lots of talking with random people about gentrification of Manhattan, some black and white footage thrown in from various time-frames, not necessarily relevant to the topic. Penny Marshall was pretty funny, but I can just watch an old episode of Laverne and Shirley for that.

I bought this because I read that NPR had featured this ""documentary"". Guess I should have done more research, but, it sounded worthwhile. I'm portraying a female shirtwaist striker In NYC in 1915 in a play that opens in a couple weeks, and was trying to gain some insight into what a NY accent might have actually sounded like during that time frame, and I gained nothing from this film regarding that whatsoever.

It's really too bad because the (his)story of the NY accent could be really interesting to cover in a documentary. This one didn't do it.",1440892800,,1055,4.791208791208791
