4525979,4,B0051T480I,"THE PERFECT HOST has more twists than a pretzel and most of them are cleverly executed.  But is there a point where too many twists sabotage the whole project?
The movie focuses on a bank robber's attempt to elude capture by insinuating himself into the confidence of a foppish gentleman preparing to host an elegant dinner party for a few close friends.  Of course, both the host and the robber have underlying secrets that provide the first major twist and as the evening progresses, even stranger things are revealed.  Further information would result in the verboten spoilers; suffice to say it borders on incredulity.  It does have a devilishly perverse ending, though.
David Hyde Pierce is indeed the perfect host.  His performance is deftly controlled even in his most manic moments, shifting effortlessly from perverse humor to simple perversion.  It is a remarkable performance.  Clayne Crawford is equally impressive as the robber who mistakenly underestimates his host.  Singer Helen Reddy shows up in a small role as Pierce's busybody neighbor, and acquits herself well.  The movie held my interest and is refreshingly different.  The last twist regarding Pierce's real identity just seems a little over the top.  Still worthwhile viewing.",1315180800,3,1251,5.205
4525980,4,B0051T480I,"Films with a twist are a strange animal, aren't they? Certain filmmakers have made a career out of it like Christopher Nolan and M. Night Shyamalan while films like Oldboy and The Usual Suspects completely rely on a twist to give everything a bit of a deeper meaning. But when does it become too much? If a film has more than one twist is it overkill? What about the ones with several? Getting tangled up in swerve after swerve probably isn't a good idea. That's one of the reasons most people hated Basic. Maybe it's a guilty pleasure of mine, but I almost always enjoy a movie with a good twist or two in it. And frankly, The Perfect Host is unlike anything the films it may share traits with.

Everything seems like an open and shut case as the movie begins. John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) just robbed a bank and is looking for a sanctuary of sorts to take cover in until the heat blows over. He stumbles onto the home of Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce), which happens to be a rather extravagant home. Warwick is preparing for a dinner party and eventually lets John in after John convinces him that he's a friend of a friend. Push comes to shove and suddenly Warwick is up to speed and John now has the upper hand. But things aren't always what they seem and it just so happens that John walked right into Warwick's trap. The night only gets stranger and stranger for John as Warwick's insanity takes center stage.

The movie is mainly a cat and mouse game between John and Warwick. John Taylor initially comes off as a selfish, despicable lowlife but there's actually a pretty interesting back story to him. Warwick's story is just as interesting. He's classy, quirky, and charming in an awkward kind of way. He has this Jack Torrance quality to him that draws you to his character. His antics are what make the film as good as it is. It'd be like injecting Rubber's outlandish qualities into the first half of The Human Centipede before the actual human centipede comes into play. The Perfect Host is a dark, humorous, and spellbinding journey.

The music also compliments the visuals so well. The quieter and more orchestral sounding pieces not only match the class that Warwick is trying to project, but also make his darker intentions put you a bit more on edge. Not that anything is relatively terrifying in The Perfect Host, but everything is so outlandish that you're not entirely sure what to expect. The music tends to get more over the top to match Warwick's spiral into madness, which is a superb quality for a film like this to have.

The Perfect Host may be a bit overwhelming to some. The way the film is constantly twisting and turning in directions you don't expect may come off as a little tiresome, but it is really fantastic if you're a fan of unpredictability. Things you've thought you've figured out unravel to reveal you only knew part of the story. It's as if The Perfect Host has a never-ending amount of layers that's driven by the rather incredible performance of David Hyde Pierce and the equally impressive Clayne Crawford. The Perfect Host won't be for everyone, but to the ones it does speak to is some of the finest bat$#%! insanity to ever be filmed.

The DVD is mostly bare bones when it comes to special features. We get a Making of featurette featuring writer and director Nick Tomnay. The feature is about eleven minutes long and features Tomnay talking about the film spliced with scenes of the film. There is some interesting stuff in there like how The Perfect Host was originally a short, black and white flim that was shot in 2000, only taking 17 days to shoot the film, and Clayne Crawford putting a rock in his shoe to keep his limp up throughout the film. Tomnay also tells us how David Hyde Pierce came aboard and discusses how important the music is to the film. Then there's the four and a half minute featurette HDNet: A Look at The Perfect Host. This is mostly just a highlight reel from the film along with David Hyde Pierce talking about it. Throw in the theatrical trailer and that wraps up the special features.

The Perfect Host is rated R for language, some violent content and brief sexual material. It's presented in English 5.1 Dolby Digital sound with optional Spanish subtitles and has a widescreen aspect ratio of 1.78:1. It's approximately 93 minutes long and should be available in both retail stores and most online retailers now.",1314748800,13,4402,4.601273885350318
4525981,5,B0051T480I,"I loved this movie. It's a psychological thriller/dark comedy with twists I did not expect. It's a very entertaining, clever, fun, ride. Suspenseful one minute, funny the next. The movie, the characters in it, and the plot, are completely unpredictable. It has it's own original style. A brilliant script, beautifully directed and the acting by David Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford is excellent. David Hyde Pierce is amazing as the memorable Warwick Wilson. I first saw this film at the Sundance Film Festival and it was one of my favorite films there. Highly recommended.",1314316800,8,573,5.1063829787234045
4525982,3,B0051T480I,"A criminal running away from the scene of a crime falls into the hands of a madman. Then the fun begins with some quite interesting twists and turns. As time got on, the story got better as nothing is quite what it seems.

The characters are I will not say believable, but interesting.

The acting is reasonable. I did like Nathaniel Parker performance.

What did surprise me was I found out it was made in 2011, the set and equipment shown in the movie seem much older. I am not sure whether that was done on purpose.

Would I see it again, no. Much of the excitement in the plot is these twists and turns, and I know them now but I would recommend it!",1314230400,2,653,4.2
4525983,4,B0051T480I,"""Your my guest and I'm glad your here, but you only have yourself to blame."" After robbing a bank and having his face and name broadcast all over TV, John (Crawford) needs a place to lay low. After con-ing his way into a strangers house he thinks he's safe. This is another example of a movie that could have been a terrible made for TV movie made into a legit movie by the casting. Warwick (Pierce) is a character that could be way over the top and unbelievable, but due to the fact that ""Niles"" played him it made him that much creepier. He really added a dimension to the character by playing him normal, simply by who he is. If a no-name was cast in the part he would not have been as creepy has Pierce (due to his ""baggage"" he brings). Trying not to repeat myself too much...this is a C- movie made much much better by the acting and casting. I liked it. Overall, a very creepy movie with a very cool twist. Very surprisingly good movie. I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I think I would.

It did not disappoint.  It's a very character-driven suspense story. Even if you figure out the first couple twists, you won't guess them all.

4525993,5,B0051T480I,"Perfect Host is a completely unexpected movie. It has elements of horror but also of pitch black comedy and whimsy. David Hyde Pierce as Warwick is simply amazing. He lives in his own fantasy world where he is the life of the party with countless friends when in reality, he's just home alone. His favorite friends that include Roman, Chelsea, Rupert, and Monica are all different people in his mind that speak to him and give him advice. It's kind of like a very disturbing version of Heart and Souls. We get a glimpse of him in his life outside and his demeanor and even his way of speaking is completely different than when he's in his fantasy world. The entire dinner and after party scenes are filled with tension. Unpredictable Warwick could engage in polite conversation or drug him or bet him or anything in between.

John Taylor knows he's in way over his head when Warwick introduces his friends and shows John his murder dinner scrapbook. Based on this information, I had a firm idea of where the film would go, but time after time I was proven wrong. John is our entryway into Warwick's world and he fades into the background over time. He was the main character, but Warwick was infinitely more interesting. John robs a bank to help someone he loves, but this storyline has been seen time and time again. He couldn't even keep up the facade of knowing one of Warwick's friends up for very long because of his temper and his lack of commitment. No wonder his heist didn't work. His story line is the most boring, but Warwick definitely makes up for it. The ending leaves the story open for a sequel that I hope happens because it will be infinitely more sinister. I would only watch if David Hyde Pearce returned, obviously.",1490054400,,1736,4.564102564102564

I got Silence of the Lambs meets Sybil, meets Six Feet Under.  I wasn't disappointed!  This movie was unexpected, unpredictable and thoroughly enjoyable.  It wasn't TOO dark, wasn't TOO funny.

4526022,5,B0051T480I,"I love David Hyde Pierce and think him a terrific actor. Well, in this film he does not disappoint. This indie film was an entrant in the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. It had a budget of only $500,000, and is a much better film than so many multi million dollar blockbusters that I have seen. Moreover, it is highly original in its premise.

The initial premise is simple. A man is wanted for bank robbery. This man, John, is on the run from the police. He needs a place to hideout. He randomly selects a home and gains entry through subterfuge. There he makes the acquaintance of the homeowner, a seemingly effete and mild mannered man named Warwick, who is cooking and getting ready to host a dinner party. John then makes his move, only to find that things are not as they at first seemed. More than that I will not say, as the best is yet to come.

The film fills in John's back story, and there are many surprises there, as well. In fact, the film is filled with many surprising twists and turns, most of which I did not see coming. David Hyde Pierce steals the show, as he gives a bravura performance. The film is alternately funny and sad, and, above all, suspenseful and surprising.",1453766400,2,1189,4.4

I definitely watched a movie that was different than expected but taught me quite a bit about imagination, story telling, character profiles, and plot development.  You have the character of John Taylor (played by Clayne Crawford) whose life dramatically changes when he decides to go into the house of Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce) after only telling him part of the story on how he might have got there. Taylor realizes what he got himself into after some time at Wilsons house.  Wilson gives Taylor a strange wine that induces hallucinations and the ability to imagine whole scenes and people unexpectedly. Taylors memories of a woman who he fell in love with Simone Demarchi come into his mind (played by Magahn Perry).  Warwick Wilsons neighbor Cathy Knight (played by Helen Reddy) becomes concerned for what she hears next door but goes back to her house after Wilson uses his storytelling skills to explain away the moans and his dinner guest wearing a mask.  Viewers are then eventually treated to the job where Wilson is actually employed at to where his coworkers (played by both Joseph Will and Nathaniel Parker) are unaware of Wilsons double life persona.",1444867200,,1436,4.868852459016393

Certainly not a feel-good movie; rather, more like finally stepping off a roller coaster when the credits roll and you can finally let your pulse come back down to normal.

The latter can therefore manipulate and toy with those stuck in the common perception of events.

4526192,4,B0051T480I,"This movie was a joy to watch, but somewhat surprisingly, I expected it to be more outrageous considering the previous reviews. This movie didn't have a surprise ending - it had clever plot development. I won't add spoilers, but there is plenty of foreshadowing to suggest a vague version of what happens in the end. It kept me guessing, no doubt, but I was hardly surprised. I give it four stars instead of five because of a lack of development at the end of the movie, which wraps up fairly quickly. Throughout, there are parts that are very well done compared to parts that seem lazily filmed, which I didn't like. The music was okay, but could have been better (I suppose I expected better of Dr. Niles Crane, haha). Overall, it was well acted by its main cast, but over-acted by its supporting cast, which weighed heavily on the light, subtleties that made the film so enjoyable. Very funny and entertaining, as it should be, considering the title. The film was, indeed, the perfect host for an delightful evening with a great glass of wine!",1416787200,,1046,4.629032258064516

4526208,4,B0051T480I,"I stopped watching this film when Hyde Pierce's character started showing John the black and white Super 8 video (you'll know why when you see it). However, curiosity got the best of me--I HAD to know how the storyline played out so I continued watching.

THE PERFECT HOST has one of the most unexpected twists I've seen in film, and a brilliantly witty ending.

Clayne Crawford is exceptional as career criminal John Taylor, and David Hyde Pierce is, well, he's crazy good in this role (you'll have to see the film to appreciate that statement).

THE PERFECT HOST is not an easy film to watch, the premise may be too hysterical for some to swallow. Hang in there if you can.
The plot twist and ending are well worth the ride.",1413590400,,726,4.526717557251908

4526216,5,B0051T480I,"At the onset, this film began to remind me of all the tension of The Rope. The tension between two men in a room was oddly reminiscent of Hitchcock's amazingly taught and suspenseful film. As the film goes on, there are even more twists and turns, and each and every one was totally unexpected. There will be no spoilers here, but be advised that The Perfect Host consistently evolves into a greater story, ultimately culminating into an astonishing climax.

Take the phone off the hook and prepare to be astonished by story-telling at its very best. This is easily one of the best and most surprising thrillers I have ever seen!",1412035200,,629,4.666666666666667

His guest gets the pleasure of joining a dinner party with many guests who are all fantasies of his host.  I won't put in any spoilers but there is one unexpected turn after another and absolutely nothing or anything is what it appears to be.  Everyone has a touch of madness in them.

The cast did an excellent job, the film had many amusing moments and the reveals at each twist were amazing. While I realize this movie was apparently low-budget, it didn't require any crappy special effects, just a damned good story. I WILL watch this again, and WILL recommend it to people I know.

As the Movie starts his character seems  a weak pushover who is in real trouble when his Dinner Guest arrives but what happens next is a surprise and he becomes more of a monster than I though he was capable of portraying. It gets even better with a fun ending. I would highly recommend this movie,1395187200,,446,4.373493975903615

Take note. There's a key difference between rating an item and reviewing it. Get this right and separate the rating (giving a certain number of stars) and reviewing process ( writing your opinions).
If you can manage that you might find that more users would be willing to rate your products if they are not also forced to write something about it.

4526319,1,B0051T480I,"The Perfect Host is an impatient movie.  Rather than delivering subtle, sumptuous hints at what is yet to come, it rushes forth, half-cooked, dropping one sloppy serving after another into viewers' laps.

John, on the run from police after robbing a bank, gains entry into the posh pad of dapper Warwick Wilson by feigning an association with one of Warwick's close friends. Warwick's accommodating gestures prove short lived when a radio news alert reveals John's true identity. His ruse exposed, John's affable demeanor turns menacing and aggressive, with all indications portending a dire outcome for Warwick. Surprisingly, the effete, ostensibly weaker, Warwick gains the dominant position, and John finds himself gagged and bound to a chair. Thus begins the first course of a deranged dinner party served with ""deception"" as the theme.

As guests begin to arrive, Warwick makes no attempt to conceal John's compromised condition. He skitters manically from room to room, ensuring the satiety of his friends whom we come to learn do not really exist at all. As host, Warwick also stops to check on his prisoner, John, every so often, leaving him with a kick, punch, burn or other assault. During each sadistic pit stop, Warwick force-feeds alcohol to John before scampering off to showcase some freakish talents which include dancing in twisting, writhing serpentine movements as well as an inexplicable air humping act.

A Perfect Host - even one played by a perfect actor such as David Hyde Pierce - needs to include more on his dinner menu than roasted duck, hardcore slapstick, and court-jester shenanigans. The superior abilities of Pierce and Clyde Crawford (a young, Michael Keaton type) might have taken this dinner gathering to a glorious finale had their roles been complemented by other interesting characters.  Evidently, The Perfect Host production team thought otherwise, opting to toss in some extras bodies as filler content, while delivering no substance. Consequently, the easy-bake oven approach that created this flop of a movie misses an opportunity to deepen the story's message about the human tendency to deceive and to mislead others. Instead, the writer fires a farrago of disordered elements into The Perfect Host's salver, straight through to the film's absurd ending.

An audience would have been better served without a mist of made-up dinner guests and a muddle of disparate, distasteful side dishes littering the table.",1392768000,3,2455,5.265984654731458
4526320,5,B0051T480I,"No spoilers here.

Any more we don't see too many movies that are ""different"".  This one is...but not something so far out of the norm that it's too far fetched either.  I watched this movie and the special features and caught myself thinking about it still a week later, even recommending it to friends as something different and very enjoyable to watch.

I'd call this movie suspense, not horror.  Horror to me any more is the blood-and-guts stuff that this movie doesn't really have.  It's also more psychologically engaging than it is visually - it's pretty low budget but this movie did not need a high budget to make it wonderful.

David Hyde Pierce plays a role so out of the norm for him that I honestly can only associate it with John Lithgow playing Arthur Mitchell - the Trinity Killer in the Dexter series from Showtime.  Not that it's the same role at all (or even really similar in most ways) but the contrast of a funny character actor switching over to a suspenseful role is what makes me bring it up.

I Love that this movie is based off of a short independent film made in Australia around 10 years ago.  I really like seeing independent film makers do something major with their work and I hope this has helped to springboard thier careers.  It's certainly well deserving.

Get this movie, it's so worth it.  ""TONGA!""

It's an attempt to get you to relate or feel sorry for him at this point, but it fails miserably. The entire movie feels choppy and splintered like a bad dream.

4526368,2,B0051T480I,"I found the movie very slow and rather boring.  I didn't find the twist of the ""turning the tables very surprising"".  I have seen it done before in several movies.  I did find Warwick's profession to be a hoot!  I believe that was the best part of the movie for me.  As for the torture...I didn't find it offensive..or horrid.  I found it tame compared to movies like Cannibal or The Serbian Film. In fact, I was rather disappointed there wasn't more and the fact that....SPOILER ALERT.....the small wounds and slashed throat were done with Warwick using a make up kit was just a let down.  Warwick may have been coo-coo for cocoa-cocoa puffs but he didn't kill anyone in the movie. In fact, he seemed like a kind caring host by even setting his victim free once the party was over.

I didn't care much for the acting/casting in the movie. The only one I was amused by was Mr. Pierce when he did his little table dance to the tune of ""Car Wash"" and there was another scene in the bathroom where he was having sex with one of his imaginary friends and spanking her imaginary behind...that was worth a giggle.  Aside from those two laughs I don't know where the rest of the comedy took place or was suppose to.

If you are into truly twisted movies or a gore hound then this is not the movie for you. If you are looking for a knee slapping comedy then this movie is not something I would recommend for you.

4526372,5,B0051T480I,"Bank Robber John Taylor (Clayne Crawford `The Baytown Outlaws' and `24') has done a heist at his girlfriend's bank, during the job he gets injured. After realising `the feds' are on to him, he seeks refuge by going to ground. After initial lack of success he rings the doorbell of seemingly nice if slightly anal type in Warwick Wilson (David Hyde-Pierce `Frasier's brother). After spinning a convoluted story of being mugged and knowing a mutual friend, he is admitted to the home of Warwick.

Warwick is expecting guests for a dinner party of perfectly cooked and presented roast duck with all the most fashionable trimmings. However, it is not long before his inquisitiveness coupled with Taylor's lack of panache start to reveal his true motives. What unfurls is a deliciously dark story of hidden desires, warped minds petulant double crosses and plot twists from plot twist Nirvana.

To say any more is trespassing in the area of plot spoiling so I will desist. This though was just broodingly sinister in places full of dark humour with David Hyde-Pierce acting himself out of the ball park in a bravura performance of the completely over the top, host. There is even a superbly camp dance routine to Rose Royce's seventies disco hit - `Car wash' - marvellous.

As you can tell I ruddy loved this; it insinuates itself into your mind for an illuminating 94 minutes and left me wanting more, it was simply effortlessly brilliant.  This is one of those films that had passed me by but is one that should have garnered a whole lot more attention; there is a cameo by Helen Reddy too.

4526391,4,B0051T480I,"I find it hard to classify this movie, and perhaps this is what has brought mixed reviews to it. Warwick Wilson seems to have come out of a Patricia Highsmith book, although with a funny twist.

If you are looking for a comedy, parts of this film are funny, but this isn't really comedy. The same applies if you're looking for a thriller. Whatever it is, I think that David Hyde Pierce's representation of a character who is a role model in the public eye, but a complete psycho behind closed doors (a funny one, though), is the highlight of this film.

If you're looking for a movie where all of it has to match, work according to reality and be feasible, watch another film.

David Hyde Pierce is absolutely perfect for this roll, as if it were written just for him to show his range of acting.  When an injured young bank robber who claims to have been mugged shows up at his door seeking entrance under the guise of knowing a mutual friend having gained information from post card in mail box, we wonder who's fooling who here.  He is eventually invited in and after using the phone to call a non-existant cousin who is not yet home, he is invited to sit for half an hour with a glass of wine until cousin will be available.  David Hyde Pierce is preparing for a dinner party and eventually invites the young man to join them which he gladly does.  Oh my, the guests are only seen through the eyes of the host (and we the viewers) who talks to them and interacts with all while always including our young man in the conversation.  Neither man is who he seems to be.  There are just too many twists and turns to tell that would only be spoilers.  I must tell you that I was very surprised when I realized that the ""old lady neighbor"" was Helen Reddy of all people.  Don't we all like to judge our aging by someone we have totally forgotten about until we see them and the recognition hits?  What a wonderful surprise this movie was.

I found myself rooting for both Taylor (Crawford) and Warwick (Hyde-Pierce), as each would gain the upper hand, only to lose it. The ending brought a nice, eeevil smile to my face...

David Hyde Pierce shows a side of his acting ability that I have never seen before and does a fantastic job going against the comedic roles he is best known for to create a creepy, psychotic character. The acting, all around, is superb and helps to kep the feeling of suspense high.

4526412,4,B0051T480I,"""The Perfect Host"" is one of those films that is at its best when nothing is happening.  Two lives collide: our protagonist, a down-on-his-luck ex-con looking for one more score, and a mild, unassuming fellow who is just trying to have a pleasant dinner party.

The thrill of ""The Perfect Host"" is that not all is at it seems and the power structures we think are calling the shots are flipped more times than a flapjack. Our criminal isn't necessarily as tough as he talks, and our mild host is far more terrifying than he at first appears.

If the film stopped there, meshing one man's lower-class struggle with the mental decay of the upper-class, ""The Perfect Host"" would be a brilliant if short film.  But director Nick Tomnay wants to keep peeling back layers, so he keeps inventing increasingly unlikely surprises about each of character.  By the time the police get involved, ""The Perfect Host"" starts overstaying its welcome.

Still, David Hyde Pierce as Warwick Wilson is at his best here playing a character that's essentially Myles with a wicked edge. He effortlessly switches between simpering and sadistic without skipping a beat.  His counter is less compelling, if only because his role consists of swearing, shouting, and stomping around in frustration.

John Taylor's (Clayne Crawford) flashbacks introduce a third character who complicates the film in ways that aren't always positive. Simone's (Meghan Perry) machinations are only slightly less believable than our host, which starts to really test the audience's patience.  The plot also tries hard to make both main characters a little more likable with mixed results.

Barring some plot hole questions (what happened to Taylor's foot? How does Wilson do any work without sleeping?), ""The Perfect Host"" is a compelling psychological thriller of one-upmanship.  Although it may not be quite perfect, it's an enjoyable way to spend an evening.",1353369600,2,1913,5.118971061093248

4526415,4,B0051T480I,"Well, i've seen this the last month or 2 showing up on some of the movie channels but to be 100% honest, I never even considered watching it. Mainly due to the fact I've never been a big fan of DHP. Never liked him on Frasier & cant say i've ever seen a film with him in it so again, had no desire or intention of watching this flick.

I just happened to turn on the tv & the movie was just starting on whatever channel the tv was on when I turned it on. Before I could change the channel, my phone rang & as I spoke on the phone I watched the 1st 3 or 5 minutes. Once I hung up the phone I wanted to at least watch a few more minutes just to see what was going on with the guy & his bag & his injury.

Needless to say, the next thing I knew I was halfway thru the movie & was really enjoying it so I obviously watched it all.

All I can say is I was shocked out how much I enjoyed the flick. LOTS of twists & turns you simply never see coming which is always good with any flick. Far too many movies are 'predictable', but this certainly was not.

Who ever thought good ole 'Niles' could not only act, but could play such a 'twisted character' & boy did he do a great job.

Anyway, no spoilers here but I will say I liked the movie so much I set my DVR to record it next time its on as I really liked the movie & certainly will watch it again. To those who were like me & had no desire to watch this flick, you may want to give it a shot. I figured I would HATE it, but I actually loved it, so don't dismiss this flick.....watch it yourself & see if YOU liked it. Im thrilled I watched it by 'accident' as had it not just been starting & had my phone not rang, I would not have watched it & im very glad I did.

Call it a 'TWIST' of fate that I caught this flick, & yes, pun intended for Niles who plays his 'twisted' charachter to perfection, imo.

Also, big thumbs up to whoever came up with this plot/script. Just great is all I can say. Movies with ALOT more 'hoopla' don't have scripts this good with so many unpredictable twists & turns. GREAT ENDING as well!

4526425,3,B0051T480I,"The Perfect Host (2010) is a tale of suspense involving a criminal on the run, with a couple of major twists that make it hard to say too much without spoiling the story.  Several times the film establishes a particular situation, only to radically change direction.  While these transitions and events do not make for a particularly credible story, the offbeat nature of what happens, and some strong acting performances by stars David Hyde Pierce and Clayne Crawford, make for an odd tale that mostly holds your interest, at least for one watch.  Some spoilers follow, so proceed as you will.

John Taylor (Crawford) has just committed a robbery, and is wanted by the police.  With an injured foot, he wanders into a residential area looking to find some refuge.  After being turned down by a woman (former pop star Helen Reddy), he convinces her neighbor, a man named Warwick Wilson (Pierce) to let him into his home.

Taylor has claimed to be an acquaintance of a friend of Wilson's, who is travelling in Australia.  Wilson, who is preparing dinner for gathering to take place at his home, plies his guest with plenty of wine, and engages in small talk about the land down under.  Taylor blows his cover when a news report about his crime comes on the radio.  He threatens his host, but before he can do anything, he falls unconscious from drinking drugged wine.

When Taylor awakens, he is tied to a chair at the dinner table, as Wilson is carrying on apparently having a party with a group of imaginary guests.  When the movie assumes Wilson's point of view, the guests are visible having a good time.  But when events are seen through Taylor's eyes, Wilson appears to be interacting with no one.  Apparently quite mad, Wilson shows Taylor a photo album with pictures of abducted people, who appear to have been beaten, cut, or perhaps killed.

The stage is set for some horrific acts to take place, but rather than a torture session, the film takes another radical turn, as Warwick Wilson assumes a completely new role, but one that still directly involves Taylor.  This much too convenient connection is a sticking point, as Taylor and Wilson soon cross paths again.  As things wind down, it appears that suspicion has fallen on the clever and confident Mr. Warwick Wilson, but whether he will pay for his crimes remains in doubt.

The writing displays a certain degree of cleverness, but the gaps and flaws in this unconventional crime drama are difficult to overcome.  Clayne Crawford gives a strong performance, but it's remarkable the way his character seems to take in stride whatever happens, no matter how weird.  David Hyde Pierce's edgy performance is entertaining, and makes the movie fun to watch.  Familiar to many for his work on the TV series Frasier, he seems a very natural fit playing a highly intelligent, but mentally unbalanced jumpy type, and the way he ambles along is another engaging quirk.

The Perfect Host is uneven, and doesn't quite pull things together, leaving the viewer to accept Warwick Wilson for the strange fellow that he is.  With some tense moments, the movie is an interesting although not entirely satisfying watch.",1340928000,,3164,4.818518518518519
4526426,2,B0051T480I,"David Hyde Pierce stars in this odd, twist-heavy home invasion thriller, in which he suddenly turns the tables on both a desperate assailant and the unsuspecting audience. It's a cinematic contortionist, so desperate to shock and surprise that it gives every single cast member a chance to swivel one hundred-eighty degrees. Unsurprisingly, that trick quickly gets old and we're left to make bold predictions on a shallow, random plot while the puppets perform their jangly, awkward little dance. Pierce is loads of fun as the ludicrously demented straight-lacer with a secret, but the film isn't particularly well-acted and the greater story arc makes almost no sense. It looks terrific for a low-budget production, but desperately needed a few more rounds of screenplay revisions and the caring touch of a proficient editor.",1339632000,,826,5.312977099236641

4526434,3,B0051T480I,"It's nice now and then to be surprised a bit by a movie. They say there are only a handful of plots that are rotated and transformed into various films so when something original comes along it's a treat. THE PERFECT HOST is one of those movies.

John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) is on the run. He's just robbed a bank of over $300,000, is wounded and the police know his name and are showing his picture on the news. Now he needs a place to hide until things cool off.

Trying one house in an affluent area of LA he's rebuffed by a Jehovah's Witness (Helen Reddy) who keeps him out of her house. Checking the mailbox next door for some insight into who lives there, he meets Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce). Spinning a tale that he's just back from Australia where he met Warwick's friend Julia, he asks to use his phone to reach his cousin for assistance since he's been mugged.

Preparing for dinner guests, Warwick allows John to use his phone and launches into a discussion about Julia. He dresses for his guests and all goes along smoothly until John, while trying to listen to the news about his robbery, loses his cool and threatens Warwick. And this is where things begin to change. It seems that Warwick had been giving John red wine that was drugged to drink and now the tables turn.

In a normal film this is where the victim would call the police, the criminal would threaten him and then later escape to insure his threat. But here we have John wake to find himself tied to a chair at the dinner table while Warwick attempts to introduce him to the party guests who have arrived. The problem is that all the guests are there in Warwick's mind only.

As the night progresses a game of cat and mouse fluctuates between these two characters. John is given an insight into what the night holds in store for him as Warwick takes his picture with a Polaroid and then shows him a scrapbook that he keeps. Each page has a picture taken of someone else. Could it be that John has landed in the home of a serial killer? And what are the chances that he will live past this night?

The movie is a great combination of mystery, suspense and dark humor as the night goes on, the party in full swing (at least in Warwick's mind) and John looking for the opportunity to escape. Occasional moments are there for him to do so, but one might guess that Warwick planned them that way to make the night more entertaining.

Pierce does a fantastic job as Warwick, a demented soul that seems like a combination of the Niles Crane character he portrayed so well on FRASIER, Hannibal Lecter and Elwood P. Dowd. He's fussy about his home, deadly to the extreme and able to see folks who aren't really there. When pieced together they make him a dangerous and unstable person to be around. A twist that I won't reveal towards the end makes him even more unusual if that's possible.

Crawford does a great job as well, keeping up with Pierce as he goes from a menacing to a sympathetic character. We didn't see the robbery from the start and never really see the entire thing, but with flashbacks we get to find out his reasons for the robbery, noble though faulted they might be. Before the night is over we hope he escapes, we hope he can find a way out of this nightmare and the city.

The twist that comes when prey becomes hunter is a nice one but it doesn't stop there. As the night winds down another twist comes across. And then this one is followed by yet a third twist and the fourth twist that makes the whole story unusual, funny and keeps you waiting for the final moments to see how it plays out. And as the final credits are about to roll, you wonder just what will happen afterwards. The answer isn't offered but various possibilities come to mind.

THE PERFECT HOST is an interesting and unusual movie more for fans of dark humor and of David Hyde Pierce. Both have something to offer here and will keep you guessing until the movie fades to black.",1332806400,3,3952,4.386612021857924

I NEVER knew what was going to happen next in this movie; (2) this movie has good acting in it -- I never liked Frasier but David Hyde Pierce should be given an award for this movie.

And then the ending of the movie came... and entirely too soon... and I was floored. I am willing to say that this movie is the single most gripping foray into such a theme as I have ever seen. Bar none, a classic worthy of watching at least twice. This movie is something shot out of time, not carrying itself on a big budget and over inflated visuals to get its point across, instead relying on an incredible performance by both leading men in the movie, and a script so well written that the twist alone elevates the movie from one I would have rated four stars, to five.

Clayne Crawford is bank robber John Taylor who gets injured on a job and crashes at Warrick's house after being rejected by the religious zealot next-door, played surprisingly by Helen Reddy.

John has every intention of victimizing Warrick, but our host is severely unhinged, and the tables are turned...and then the tables are turned...and, well, stay tuned for lots of sadistic and dark comedic fun with a surprise ending that will have you reeling.  One of my favorite parts in the movie is the ""Car Wash"" scene during which I couldn't help laughing out loud.  Part thriller and part dark comedy, this film has plenty of punch for viewers of both preferences, yet won't turn off those who like their gore and violence on the light side.

4526445,3,B0051T480I,"""The Perfect Host"" may not be the perfect movie but it's darn entertaining particularly when David Hyde Pierce dominates the movie (which is most of the movie). ""The Perfect Host"" moves from a suspense thriller into a black comedy fairly quickly and the cast does their nimble best to keep up with the shifting tone. There are a couple of twists in the movie and, if you buy them, you'll enjoy the movie more than less.

John Taylor (Clayne Crawford)a bank robber on the run from the police cons his way into the home of Warrick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce)unaware that Warrick who is hosting a dinner party that night isn't mentally there. The tone shifts and rather than Taylor being the cat preying on an innocent homeowner, he finds the tables turned.

The Blu-ray was shot in digital with the Red One camera which results in a presentation that doesn't have as much depth as I'd like although blacks are pretty solid throughout and color--although muted--is consistent as well. The meager bit rate probably doesn't do the film any favors considering how short the movie is, you'd expect this to be at a higher bit rate.

The lossless audio sounds quite good although you should keep in mind that this is primarily a dialogue driven movie it does come alive during the party scenes where music is blasted at full volume.

The special features are on the lean side. Co-writer and director Nick Tomnay discusses his decision to expand his 25 minute black and white short film into a feature film and working with a low budget often having to DIY most of the stuff including editing the film on weekends.

The second featurette was clearly created as a promo piece to entice viewers to see the film and it's quite good as summarizing the plot and appealing to those who haven't seen the film. We also get a couple of previews and the trailer for the film which interested me in seeing this initially.

It's a pity that the film doesn't include the original 25 minute film that the director made. It would have been fascinating to compare the two and even see how they compliment each other.

The performances by Crawford and Pierce as mentioned are marvelous and provide much of the fuel that makes the film chug along. The somewhat clumsy introduction of the subplot involving the police looking for Taylor would probably have worked if it had been more carefully introduced into the film. As it is the two strands run parallel without truly intersecting until the very end of the story for the pay off twist ending. There's a lot of potential in the story some of it realized nicely (the main story thread) and some of it not so much (the subplot involving the police).

Although it's not a perfect film, ""The Perfect Host"" will do a good job of keeping you entertained but like a party the last act veers out of control a bit appearing a bit tacked on.

I'd still recommend ""The Perfect Host"" for rental. 3 1/2 stars",1325808000,,2918,4.606936416184971

As a general note, I don't consider anything in the trailer or the first ten minutes of the film to be any real spoiler, but apparently I'm alone in that so: SPOILER WARNING.  This movie is somewhere between ""The Last Supper"" and ""American Psycho,"" with just a touch of ""Sybil.""  The main plot involves a bank robber, John Tyler, on the run from the law after a job goes south.  He impersonates a friend  of a friend to Warwick (Pierce) to get inside his home which spells his own doom.  He ends up drinking from a bottle of drugged wine and wakes up at the dinner party.

This is a beautiful movie, a gorgeous blend of suspense and comedy.  Definitely a mind game that will keep you guessing to the end.  I plan on sharing this with everyone I know.  If you like something that breaks the mold and is unpredictable, this movie is one to watch.  I am a die hard fan of suspense thrillers and this is my absolute favorite.

4526450,4,B0051T480I,"I won't waste your time repeating what others have said, nor will I offer any ""spoilers"" in my commentary... so feel free to read on if you've not seen this film yet but have been wondering if you'd enjoy watching it:

David Hyde Pierce is one of America's most versatile and skilled actors working today. It certainly goes without saying that his brilliant portrayal of ""Niles"" in the television show FRASIER was consistently incredible. And his wildly successful performance in the enthusiastically acclaimed Broadway musical production of CURTAINS was thrilling to watch. But this little motion picture skillfully guides out him out of anyone's belief that he'd ever become type-casted. It grabs your undivided attention from beginning to end, causing you to marvel at how such a small-budget film can succeed at being SO entertaining in *spite* of having such a small budget.

The movie is a unique, well-paced and small cast black comedy ""thriller"" wherein both male leads - Mr. Pierce and Mr. Clayne Crawford - deliver such enthralling performances that you will find yourself wondering exactly which of their two characters you ""should"" be rooting for. Rather than presenting the viewer with ""super-smooth,"" finely detailed cinematography so common among today's digitally-photographed high resolution motion pictures, this film is deliberately shot with a somewhat grainier, ""grittier"" feel. And while its supporting cast members deliver incredibly fine and properly restrained performances, the supporting male cast member portraying the character of a subordinate police detective deliberately presents his role as a cardboard character for the sole purpose of reminding you of exactly which characters you need to keep yourself focused on. It's done on *purpose*.

So without ""giving away the store,"" I'll leave you with this final thought and suggestion: If you loved the character of ""Niles"" in FRASIER, enjoyed the 1982 comedy thriller DEATHTRAP (with Michael Caine and Christopher Reeve), find yourself to be a secret admirer of Showtime's DEXTER, and still find yourself just occasionally longing for another sneak viewing of THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW, you will LOVE ""The Perfect Host""! Buy it or watch it via streaming or downloaded video; either way you will NOT regret it. - And yes, it has creatively entertaining elements of ALL FOUR!

We see him carefully prepare for a dinner party - he impeccably sets the table and times the duck for exactly 8:30 p.m. And then career criminal John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) enters the scene posing as a friend of a friend.  He tells a sad story of being mugged and losing his luggage.  But as the evening progresses and the alcohol flows, a very different dynamic is revealed.  This twisted psychological thriller reminds that appearances can be most deceiving.  Although the critics did not embrace this film, I kind of enjoyed the LA based story, especially the apparent premise and first half.  Before the story derailed, it captured a lot of what the City of Angels is all about in terms of how far we will go to satisfy our fantasies.  As the poster says, ""Dinner parties are a dying art.""

The character Warrick played by David Pierce fits the part just right. And paraphrasing one reviewer, who stated; ""you might guess one or two of the twists but you will NOT guess them all or the ending"". The acting and the story would fit a Hitchcock movie or be labeled as a dark mystery or even as a dark comedy but it keeps the viewer wondering what is going to happen next, or who Warrick really is!

Then I went to Broadway to see him in the most fantastic Kander & Ebb musical, ""Curtains"".  He was phenomenal in that show. I wound up seeing it a total of 17 times, the number would be greater if the show had not closed.

That's why I pre-ordered this movie. There is nothing wrong with DHP's acting, he is always great, but the script, or the director, or some thing was terribly wrong. If you like strange, weird movies, you might enjoy it, but if you are looking for comedy, watch some ""Frasier"" re-runs.",1318550400,3,731,4.244604316546763

4526456,3,B0051T480I,"Few movies successfully manage to combine horror and comedy, probably because the two are such perfect companions, people tend to over-think it.  Not so with Nick Tomnay's THE PERFECT HOST.  The film is laugh-out-loud hilarious in spots, while in others it is genuinely disturbing.

For it's first two-thirds, HOST is almost existential.  It revolves around bank robber John (Clayne Crawford) who seeks refuge in the house of unassuming Warwick (David Hyde Pierce), who turns out to be a lunatic.  There's no mistaking it: this is Hyde Pierce's film, and for much of it he nimbly carries its weight on his unpredictable shoulders.  Known for the straight-arrow role of Niles Crane on ""Frasier,"" Pierce clearly has a ball slipping into Warwick's blood-soaked shoes, dancing and humping air and twisting about like a nine-year-old on an acid trip.  He's utterly mesmerizing, switching from serious to hilarious with a snap of his fingers.  More surprisingly, Crawford is a perfect match.  He has some hilarious moments himself (""I can't speak for everyone else, but I'm having a great time""), but he's really meant to induce a sense of pathos, which he manages admirably.  For a good part of the film, he's swooning in an alcoholic daze, and yet he still manages to be likeable and sympathetic.  His role is rather thankless (Pierce is the star here), but Crawford doesn't seem to mind much.

If the film had remained with these two characters, inside Warwick's house, it would have been an easy 5 stars.  Unfortunately, somebody somewhere must have expressed concerns about having a film revolving around one clearly unsympathetic character, and another who pushes the limits.  So they creates some flashbacks, and then a few scenes with detectives, and then tacked on a third act that sort-of brings everything together.  Or at least it's meant to; what it actually does is destroy the point of the film.  THE PERFECT HOST is, indeed, near-perfect when it's confined inside the walls of Warwick's house; but when the outside world encroaches, it becomes entangled in its own innate unbelievability, and so flounders.  The film is still worth a few viewings, but that third act is so utterly disappointing, it makes you wish the filmmakers had been a little more gutsy.",1318118400,21,2268,5.037533512064343

4526459,4,B0051T480I,"I really enjoyed the film.  The acting is good.  David Hyde Pierce completely sheds his sit-com persona (a few times) and gives up some really intense acting.  The other guy is pretty good too, but I wouldn't recognize him if he came up and spat in my face.  Anyway, the film offers a lot of surprises which will keep you hooked.

It is beautifully filmed.  We expect the rich guy to have a great looking California pad, but check out the lowly bank teller's joint.  It's decorated on a bank-teller's salary, I think, but it is really sophisticated.  This works well with the appearance-vs-reality theme of the movie.  You might know how to play chess,  but do you really know how to move people?

........................Spoiler Alert.............................................

In spite of the 'likes' I have for this movie, I was a bit disappointed by the ending.  Much of the movie works because of the tension between the characters acting in a real world and their perception of the world.  In the last twenty mintues or so, after the main character takes off the fake cuts and we learn DHP's real job, we lose that tension.  It becomes pretty much a standard cat-and-mouse game and the cool psychological element is lost.  Sure there's the tension of the assistant cop getting the info he does, but that just leaves this open to blah blah blah.  This movie should have ended with the main character killing himself with one of those swords hanging over the fireplace, with his understanding that something very dark inside his host has a counterpart inside himself.",1317945600,,1574,4.857142857142857

Who remembers Helen Reddy ? Well she's the nosy neighbor who plays her part so well and tries to get involved.

I'm a big fan of Indie flicks as they rely more on the story and the characters as opposed to effects, egos and bank roll. This one delivers. The acting is top notch and DHP delivers a crazed character with a Niles Crane overtone and a Jeffrey Dhammer undertone that has you smiling at his antics when you know you shouldn't be.

4526462,3,B0051T480I,"John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) is a bank robber on the run, wounded in his leg. To find a place where he can hide temporarily from the police, John cons his way into the house of Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce), a mild-mannered, middle-aged man living in a big and comfortable house in a suburb. What John Taylor didn't know is that the house's host was preparing a dinner party. And kind and polite Warwick Wilson is ""the perfect host"" of the very strange dinner party John has to join.

First, let me say that if you are looking for gory horror movies like ""Hostel,"" this movie is not for you. (The film's trailer is a bit misleading.) Violence is included in ""The Perfect Host,"" but the thriller - I think it should be called a thriller - has also some off-kilter comedic elements.

The best part of ""The Perfect Host,"" Australian writer/director Nick Tomnay's feature debut, is David Hyde Pierce as nice and polite Warwick Wilson, who slowly reveals his true colors. Clayne Crawford is also effective as the criminal who has to deal with the very unusual situations around him.

However, the film feels padded even at 93 minutes. (""The Perfect Host"" is based on a 2001 short film by the same director.) Not every action takes place inside of Warwick's home, which weakens the intriguing premise considerably. Also, the film's lengthy third act adds little to the film's thrills. What intrigued the viewers initially is replaced by something more banal and unoriginal as the film attempts to wrap up neatly.

In ""The Prefect Host"" David Hyde Pierce shines as the titular host. His superb acting as the ""perfect"" host is worth the money and time you spend.",1317513600,,1660,4.73356401384083
4526463,1,B0051T480I,"First off, it was in the comedy section of Amazon streaming.  It's definitely NOT a comedy.

Second, it's very dark and twisted, edited very slowly, and has little redeeming value.

The only good thing about it is that David Hyde Pierce played a screwed up character very well.  But it's directed and edited so badly that doesn't redeem the film at all.",1317427200,4,353,4.645161290322581
4526464,4,B0051T480I,"I think I am still in shock over this one.  David Hyde Pierce is astounding in this very unorthodox role of madness.  This movie is so psychotically delicious, it borders on ""The Twilight Zone"" meets ""Sybil"".  I found myself laughing out of total fear of the incredulousness and depravity of the host.  I did NOT see the ending coming or even imagine it to end the way it did.  The movie works on several levels, from the civility of human compassion to the intrinsically evil darkness of insanity.  This movie is a must see for those looking for just plain ""bizarre"".  This one had me thinking about it several days after watching it and when a movie does that to me, then my appetite for wanting 'something different in a movie' is complete.  Get ready for one heck of an emotional roller coaster ride.  Mr. Pierce, WOW.",1317081600,77,822,4.537414965986395
4526465,5,B0051T480I,"I loved this movie. The twists and turns were great.  This movie shows how a situation can change at the blink of an eye.

About 15 minutes into the movie I thought WTF?!? and went back to the previous chapter to make sure I saw what I thought I saw.

I actually screamed with surprise when the detective showed up at Warwick's door.

Warning to those who have not seen this movie yet.  You must use your imagination in order to understand what each character sees to get the full effect.",1316131200,2,488,4.318681318681318
4526466,5,B0051T480I,"John Taylor (Clayne Crawford) is on the lam. We get flashbacks of the crime as the movie progresses. He cons his way into the home of Warwick Wilson (David Hyde Pierce) who reminded me of a gay Kelsey Grammer. John's picture is all over the news. Before the party can start, John reveals to Warwick who he is and forces him to call the guests and cancel the party that is supposed to start in 15 minutes.

The film has an early twist...and a few lesser twists later on, so don't expect to see too much on plot in reviews. We have seen this kind of thing in horror movies, but the delightful soundtrack turned this movie into an excellent dark quirky comedy. I suggest you watch the movie and not read Amazon reviews on this one as they give away too much of the twist.

F-bomb, no sex, no nudity.",1315180800,,796,4.264900662251655
