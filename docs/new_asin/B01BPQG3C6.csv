7665362,2,B01BPQG3C6,"This is a story I know well, fortunately because this film glosses over so much of the story. For me it felt like reading the Clift notes rather than any type of true examination of the events which occurred. The film failed to engage me, which is a huge disappointment. Perhaps the film makers assumed that everyone already knows the in depth accounts and were only attempting to dramatize them. If that was their goal, I suppose they succeeded, albeit a very low bar. I think they could have done much better.",1458432000,6,511,4.565217391304348

Champion
Hero
Legend.

He did what he had to do to make a living in a known dirty sport. He didn't invent doping he just had to get on board with it. It was that or give up your life time career path. The whole peloton was doping. He was just the fall guy. Yes, he lied about it but........he was protecting the sport. If tested all the other 199 guys out there would have been positive for  performance-enhancing drugs.

That's my two cents about this. Think about it.....what would you do if your lively hood was threatened by people getting an edge. ( epo) most would decide to jump on board.

I have seen this film it is filmed well.
Long live the best cyclist ever!",1458172800,2,687,4.2615384615384615
7665365,3,B01BPQG3C6,"Directed by Stephen Frears and based on the book by Irish sports journalist, David Walsh (Chris ODowd), who penned Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong. While writing for The Sunday Times, he became relentless in his suspicion and search for any evidence that the cyclist used illegal and/or enhanced substances to perform much too inexhaustibly while gaining win after win in the Tour de France races. He believed him to just about average and now he actually was a tremendous feat and a cycling sport which Walsh loved personally. Something didn't add up now for Walsh concerning Armstrong; he was just too good too quickly.

The audience which I viewed this with was not very knowledgeable about Lance Armstrongs (Ben Foster) story in the media, even as it is still now widely known. Just their responses were as entertaining as what I was viewing on the big screen. As they were becoming educated, I was learning all over again about this arrogant man and Foster performed the role of the narcissist quite well. As David Walsh takes an early interest in Armstrong, becoming acquainted in 1993, he believed that he certainly had the enthusiasm to be a cyclist but not the possibility of ""greatness"" to achieve what he did. He knew straight away that something was very wrong (or was he?) and had to be going on to see this particular cyclist going on to win seven in a row - from 1999 to 2005 - at the Tour de France, something that nobody could have predicted, and to this particular level? Even the doctor Lance approached way back at the beginning, Michele Ferrari (Guillaume Canet), told him point blank that he could be a good racer but never a great one and why that was so. Any of these very honest exchanges came prior to Armstrong and his team beginning The Program of Ferraris which put Lance Armstrong way out in front in the world of professional cycling and a national hero of the U.S.

Lance begins doping to get ahead very early in the film and his cancer is realized directly at the start; testicular and brain cancer for which he undergoes the necessary treatments and surgeries. Having no white blood cells to speed the healing process and void of natural antibodies, his surgeon must question him. Among a roomful of visitors present he actually gives the doctors the ""go ahead"" to question him about whether he had ever used any ""performance-enhancing drugs"". Armstrong answers without restraint and goes on to heal almost miraculously from cancer of which he will say later; After the disease, I never want to be that close to losing again. Becoming the cycling champion year after year, Armstrong begins a cancer foundation in his own name before a large-scale merging with another and also marries beginning his own family life. David Walsh is closing in with the press following whether alongside him or in total disbelief while questioning about performance enhancing drugs (doping). Will journalist, David Walsh be understood involving his own reticence to believe such a remarkable rise to the top for this mediocre cyclist whom he first met? Lance Armstrong is a huge figure - or icon, if I may - by now. He has Presidents in his pocket, other significant names such as Mayors of extremely large cities and ceos of major companies all who are all constantly praising him. He has become as if he is the biggest item of pride for the United States, a national hero, and there is nobody to topple Lance's grandiosity Or, is there? When it comes to the ways that cyclists are tested for doping, it is getting harder and stricter to get around these tests each time. Will they catch up to him or will he catch up with them? By the way, the ending plays out; I would say both are true. Kind of as the old idiom goes, ""you scratch my back, Ill scratch yours"" - Lance Armstrong uses his 'own' back scratcher on himself and that was his downfall.

Using a great amount of information (at times, I even forgot that this was Foster and not Armstrong during the film), Frears gives us another look at Lance Armstrong through the eyes - then words - of David Walsh (nicely done by Chris ODowd) who was suspect, then extremely let down by the athlete, from the very beginning and was nobodys fool throughout the film, either.",1457740800,10,4254,4.684491978609626
7665366,4,B01BPQG3C6,"This is the story of Lance Armstrong and is based on the book by journalist David Walsh called ""Seven Deadly Sins: My Pursuit of Lance Armstrong"". Walsh worked for The Sunday Times and is played by the brilliant Chris ODowd in the film. Walsh was one of the few who questioned the phenomenal rise of Armstrong from mediocre hill climber to King of the mountains and unbeatable in The Tour de France.

Now the story is full of lies and deceit and evil doings and as such you would think it was full of Machiavellian twists  but no; it seems a bit flat to be honest. The story is interesting but seems to lack the oomph moments to bring it to anything approaching a dramatic crescendo.

I think half the problem is that we all know the story by now and so there is not that much to reveal and we have already gotten truly over our initial shock and disgust at what was a crime the perpetuated for years and corrupted so many  so called- athletes. Having said all that I really enjoyed it. Ben Foster puts in an excellent performance as the duplicitous Armstrong and was even convincing in the cancer bits and the double dealing lies. So one that rises from being above ok but do not expect to be blown away.",1457481600,11,1205,4.342222222222222

7665369,4,B01BPQG3C6,Not a documentary and should be not expected as such. I enjoyed it.,1497657600,,67,4.230769230769231
7665370,2,B01BPQG3C6,"I watch the Tour of France every year; I lived in Europe for five years, and over there, cycling, rugby, and football (soccer) are the leading sports like baseball, NFL football, NBA basketball, and NHL hockey is for us here.

So in part, I watch the Tour for different reasons. One is to see the picturesque Pyrennees and the Alps mountainsides, and the Chameau goats climbing the steep cliffs. So to see the movie, The Program, is old hat. The acting was so-so, even though Ben Foster did look a little bit like Lance Armstrong, and Chris O'Dowd didn't remind me of Floyd Landis.

As far as directing Stephen Frears missed the boat. This movie simply wasn't his gig, since it appeared he didn't have an in depth understanding of the Tour. That's understandable. Cycling is a minor sport in the country at best. The three-week tour is on TV, only for a day in the network channels, yet on cable it's on every day like it is in Europe. So for someone in this country to understand the Tour and to understand this whole complicated debacle with enhancement performance drugs is complicated matter.

The bottom line is the Tour de France has been going on for over 100 years. It started in 1903, and the Tour was stopped for both World War I and II. So Armstrong getting caught for doping is no big deal in Europe. It happened, nevertheless, the Tour goes on. His doping confession on TV was a lot bigger deal here than over there. Just like professional cycling is a bigger deal over there, than over here.

This movie fails to get that concept. It was more about Armstrong's misdoings than it was about the Tour de France. Yet over here, most don't care about the Tour de France. That's where this movie falls flat.

And as far as EPO abuses, I would guess, simply a guess, that the NFL has plenty of cases of players taking EPO, performance enhancers, as well as baseball, less so, and let's not forget hockey and basketball. EPO has taken over the sporting world. Simply because the players play better, the drugs make them stronger, quicker, and faster. This movie does show that. The Program shows in detail the mania involved in sports.

It also showed Armstrong telling the camera that he has never been caught, tested positive. Yet this move fails to explain the reason. Every day, a new EPO, performance enhancing drug comes out, doctors like the ones in San Francisco, cook up new EPOs often. So it becomes almost impossible to test for a substance that the testers don't know exist yet. To test for drugs, the tester picks a certain drug to test for. If the tester doesn't know the drug, he/she can't test for it. That's why Armstrong had never tested positive. Dr. Michele Ferrari was a smart doctor, and knew how to circumvent the loopholes in drug testing.

Enhancement drugs are a complicated mess. The movie, The Program, only explains the complications in part. Yet for dramatic sake, I guess it would have been best to avoid it. And another knock on this movie, some of the details had either been stretched, rearranged, or invented, simply to tell a story. Fine of those not familiar with the Tour, not so fine with those who know and understand the Tour de France.",1497052800,,3183,4.59330985915493

7665438,5,B01BPQG3C6,"What a fascinating story.  The film does a great job making a boring subject worth watching.  However, the more significant accolades should go to the lead actor and his ability to convey many different emotions.

I didn't realize the depth of deception and dangerous practices this man was capable of all in the name of winning and ego. A very good depiction of the downfall of an icon and destruction of a life that could have gone so well, but ended in disgrace. The saddest part is he still can't be honest about it even today.",1475712000,,456,4.376470588235295
7665441,4,B01BPQG3C6,I thought it was entertaining.  And taking into account one of the years you had to go to 23rd place before you found a rider who was not doping.  Lance still had to ride the bike.,1475712000,,180,3.9722222222222223
7665442,2,B01BPQG3C6,It tries to tell too much of a story. 18 years of Lance Armstrongs life and he looks completely unchanged. There is a great story but not enough effort was made to tell it like it should be.,1475539200,,190,4.026315789473684
7665443,3,B01BPQG3C6,Film is done very nicely with the original footage from the time. If you are into cycling however you already know every detail of the story. I thought it was disappointing that they cut the end short.,1475539200,,201,4.45945945945946

Lance Armstrong is the cycling equivalent of Bernie Madoff, and I personally believe that both their asses belong in jail. At some level, I really don't give much of a damn what happens to either of them, but it DOES seriously irritate me to imagine what Lance must have been telling his wife that allowed her to go ahead with that whole Overhaulin' charade. Everybody deserved better than to be involved in his life in any way. Sorry Sheryl, you deserved better than to be duped by this guy. You, too, Chip. And Bernie - well, there's really no way to properly express the contempt I feel for him. It's kind of hard to really comprehend what must have been going on with either or both of them to have made their actions even remotely understandable.

Almost completely absent (except for one scene with a cancer patient) is Armstrong's extreme charisma, and the graciousness that he showed so many times.  Equally missing is the suffering and preparation in terms of equipment, wind tunnels, training, and the financial ability to focus on a singular race and goal each year that is equally responsible for the success of USPS/Discovery.  If you know anything about Armstrong you will be struck by the fact that any time there is an opportunity to portray him one way or the other, the result is always to place him in a negative light.  (Example, the sneer at Alberto Contador, which simply was not existent on the podium after Armstrong finished 3rd in the 2009 TDF).  I appreciate that there are those who feel the need for vindication and/or retribution against Lance Armstrong.

You can't sum up the rise and fall of Lance Armstrong (spanning roughly 2 decades) in a 1 hour 43 minute film and hope to do the story any justice.  Ben Foster (an amazing actor) was great in his portrayal of Armstrong yet even he couldn't make up for the poorly written, short, erratic script.  This could have been an epic film, possibly even worthy of some awards, but it ended up being just a mediocre film that I will never watch again and won't recommend to anyone.

Occasionally you see a human side but the vast majority of the film demonized him. Granted, he was a jerk throughout this period but people are seldom as one-dimensional as he's portrayed here.

I feel that Frears showed us a fairly balanced representation of Armstrong leading up to his doping program and through his rather brilliant management of it. Occasionally the film even showed us the dichotomies that Armstrong and other cyclists faced in one of the world's greatest and most difficult competitive sports. That was good and helpful. It uncovered many aspects of doping, the competition, the media coverage in a clear way. Ben Foster was very convincing and eerily similar in looks to Armstrong and Chris O'Dowd was very watchable. Before I watched the movie I thought that Armstrong had cornered himself onto a path of deceit and because he is so ambitious, thought he could keep everything in check by being a bully. But it took a lot more than that to keep fooling the world for so very long. It took a team of various professionals with their own agendas and it took lots of continual looking away and not seeing, still not seeing the clear evidence or at least strong indicators of wrong doing. It took a lot to bring him down because he wasn't alone. Of course he wasn't. I thought about this film long afterwards an felt for the cyclists who would have come first if it wasn't for his extremely long tenure as champion.

7665610,3,B01BPQG3C6,"This movie does in a little under two hours what it actually took 15 years plus to gestate. There's no way the time limits of this medium could do the complexities of Lance Armstrong's cycling career any justice. Probably this would've been better served by a ten-part series, a la the People v. O.J. Simpson as was on FX recently. That said, I thought Foster had Armstong's smile/sneer down pretty well; he isn't as tall as Armstrong, but he does resemble the real McCoy somewhat. The acting was alright, but it came across as a little forced in some cases. Having lived and ridden in Europe and going to several bike races including the '04 and '05 Tours as a spectator, there was very little I wasn't already familiar with as regards the Armstrong dossier. However, somebody that doesn't know the ins and outs, let alone the nitty gritty, of the pro peloton was probably lost and it's understandable. As Armstong himself is a complex individual, so is the case and controversies that surrounded him them as well as now. Things that could've been included and still brought it in under two hours: Tyler Hamilton's role in bringing him down; Hincapie testifying against him; his divorce from Kirsten; the 2003 Tour in more depth, the one he almost lost. Bottom line: it wasn't bad but it wasn't great, either. I think a multi-episode drama across 20 or so hours of TV programming would probably make this topic a much more worthwhile endeavor.",1469923200,13,1444,4.734126984126984

I knew that Landis was from PA, but I didn't know that he had an Amish upbringing.  You could see that Landis was a man torn, but finally did the right thing after Lance didn't give him a job on his last TDF appearance.  Overall my rating is 4 stars, but that's mainly due to my heavy interest in cycling.

It feels less like a story is being told for entertainment, and more like admonishment is being delivered, and we were made to watch, bored.

All debates about doping aside, I expect stories about villains OR heroes to delve deeper and try to show how they came to be who they are and hints at what might have lead them to greatness or infamy. Without the subject's input, we can only guess at these things, but still...

7665646,2,B01BPQG3C6,"I was wondering why this never went on general release in the US..now I know, Lets start with casting. I suspect Ben Foster was cast because they could easily make him look like Lance as long as his face never moves..which it rarely does. In fact it is quite possible that a robot played this part and Ben Foster was paid a residual to allow them to use his likeness. Even people who wound up in conflict with Armstrong described him as a social, lively character who could be a lot of fun to hang out with. Foster captures exactly ZERO of that in this um..""performance"". The whole movie is a rote, lifeless , zombie-like run-through of all the well known public scenes from Lances life and adds nothing new to the understanding of the motives and characters behind the drama.",1469404800,,776,4.51063829787234

What it doesn't show you is how the other riders (other teams) were cheating (likely). It does show that hard hearted Armstrong, willing to do anything to win, including threatening riders, had a soft spot for cancer victims.
The one other shortcoming is that it doesn't really identify individual racers--there are a few exceptions. Maybe in the credits, they do, but would be nice.
Not very deep (shows no angst as he decides to come clean on Oprah), but a solid rendition of what probably happened with Armstrong.",1469318400,2,585,4.801980198019802

7665688,2,B01BPQG3C6,"For someone who doesn't know much about Lance Armstrong, this movie might be fine. For those who have followed his story and are fairly knowledgeable about his rise and fall in the cycling world and the manner in which he handled both, this movie will be very disappointing. To be fair, I'm sure it's very difficult to fit 20+ years into 1 hour and 45 minutes, but there are other biographical movies that seem to do a much better job than  The Program. It feels very disjointed, like it's just short clips of various parts of Armstrong's life thrown together without a good flow from one to the other. If you want to truly learn about Armstrong and the doping that went on during his professional career, you're much better off watching a documentary or reading any number of books written on the topic (Lance Armstrong's War, The Secret Race,Wheelmen, etc) than watching this movie. There has been much praise for Ben Foster's portrayal of Armstrong, but for me, Chris O' Dowd was the only actor who positively stood out in this movie. His portrayal of David Walsh, the key journalist determined to uncover Armstrong's doping, was smooth and believable, whereas I felt Ben Foster's portrayal of Armstrong was forced through most of the movie and seemed to be more of a caricature of Armstrong than anything else. The cycling scenes actually made the movie worse, with close ups of Ben Foster interspersed with actual footage of Armstrong - the difference between the two was too pronounced for those scenes to work well. Also, one of the biggest things that set Armstrong apart from all the other cyclists who were doping was the manner in which he set out to defame and destroy anyone who dared to speak out against him, and while the movie attempts to touch upon this a few times, it really fails to show his malice and how he made the lives of a few key people (Betsy Andreau, Emma O' Reilly) a  living hell for years. The one point I believe the movie does get across to a certain extent is how eager and willing Lance was to do whatever it took to win (i.e. doping).

Overall the movie fails to give you anything but the most basic info regarding Armstrong and doping and is absolutely worthless to anyone who already knows the basics.",1468800000,,2242,4.614035087719298

7665752,3,B01BPQG3C6,"I'm giving this three stars, but only because I am happy to see another cycling movie out there. Truthfully, if you've seen any of the documentaries or read any of the books about the USPS doping scandal or Lance, you won't learn anything new here. Of course, that is not the purpose of this movie. However, it doesn't flow like a movie. It seems like a collection of cinematic ""skits"" detailing certain events that took place throughout the Lance era. It wasn't very entertaining at all. Very disappointing.",1468108800,,508,4.784090909090909
7665753,5,B01BPQG3C6,"As a keen runner and cyclist I was eager  to watch ""The Program"" following  the life and disgraceful exit of once esteemed rider Lance Armstrong. Ben Foster as Lance was excellent in his portrayal of Armstrong as an egotistical self-centred individual concerned only with the betterment of himself. His perfection of the role was enhanced by his ability to acquire all the little nuances and expressions that was part of the makeup of the said cyclist.

I particularly enjoyed the testimony of Betsy Andreu and her disclosure of the conversation that Armstrong had with his cancer consultant on first hospital treatment..."" I said, I think we should leave to give you your privacy. I said that to Lance. And Lance said, that's OK. You can stay. And I turned to Frankie and I said, I think we should leave. And Frankie said, no, Lance said it's OK. We can stay. And so the doctor asked him a few questions, not many, and then one of the questions he asked was... have you ever used any performance-enhancing drugs? And Lance said yes. And the doctor asked, what were they? And Lance said, growth hormone, cortisone, EPO, steroids and testosterone.""

There were many casualties along the way most notably the flawed and easily influenced Floyd Landis who decided to tell all when he was dropped very quickly from the US Postal Service cycling team following his own dope scandal allegations after the 2006 tour de france. At book signings and cancer ward visits there were some glimpses of the human Armstrong before the ego returned. The real enjoyment of ""The Program"" was Foster's ability to step so convincingly into character portraying Armstrong in almost God like terms who felt he would never be caught....but the 2009 tour was a race too many and soon after followed the warts and all interview with Oprah Winfrey. Even though an admission was sought and given the cheating cyclist still believed he had really done nothing wrong...."" I viewed it as a level playing field. I looked up the definition of cheat. The definition of cheat is to gain an advantage over a rival or foe. I didn't do that. I viewed it as a level playing field.'",1468108800,,2142,4.75

It provides a good inside look at the dark side of professional sports, whether it's cycling, baseball, football, track and field.  Ben Foster did an outstanding job of portraying Armstrong, as did the actor who portrayed Landis.  I would have liked to see more interaction with Tyler Hamilton, who was also a major player in the whole mess.  I thought the story line moved along well, with powerful flashbacks.  It's hard to fathom that most of the cycling community was involved in the cover-up, from coaches, doctors, delivery men,, massage therapists, spouses, to the riders themselves.  Wow.  Lots to think about.  I highly recommend this film.",1467849600,3,705,5.069565217391304

7665778,2,B01BPQG3C6,"Beyond the cheat Armstrong was capable to hide for so many years, the film portraits an arrogant, selfish and unsensible personality, designed not only to reinforce the ilegality of Lance's actions, but to make the audience feel hate for the person (the scene when he rests over his bed speaking over the phone with Floyd and the brief time he spends without really caring at the children cancer hospital are the best examples of that). Given that most of those situations are charged with a lot of emotions of those who provided their personal experiences, who knows to which extent the film director added his own interpretation of things, making it clear that the film intention is to destroy Lance and save Landis (even if he cheated as well). Armstrong seems to have hurt badly a lot of people; his riding buddies, the media, his own exwife. Everybody knew what was going on, but kept silent for a long time. In the end, everyone brought out their frustrations and revenged against him.",1467590400,,991,4.767441860465116

He ruined peoples live's to further his own image. As a cyclist myself, I was never a fan of Armstrong, and now that the truth has come out, the only thing I ask of this fraud, is that he go away. I don't want to hear anything further about this mediocre athlete and shell of a man that doesn't deserve our time or attention. If you're reading this Lance Armstrong,

I applaud David Walsh for standing up for his beliefs, not compromising his principles, and not backing down even now. I stood up and yelled ""Finally!!!"" when Mr. Walsh challenged this cheat publicly and told the liar that he was ruining the sport of cycling. I couldn't believe it was actually being shown on television.

For me, this movie had an emotional pull because of how close I was to the story.  Switching between live (real) tour footage to the dramatized scenes pulled me in further.

I give it 3 stars because it was a compelling experience for me.  But the movie was not that great.  It seemed more like a dramatized enactment of court case details.  There was minimal character development, story arc, suspense or even humor.

If you are a bike racer, I'd say it's probably worth the hour and a half. If you are not, I wouldn't bother.",1467331200,,684,4.248062015503876

7665897,2,B01BPQG3C6,"If that is what you want, rent or view on Amazon or Netflix, ""Stop at Nothing."" Many reviewers have commented that they were disappointed not to have learned more about Armstrong from this dramatization...Well, that was not the purpose of this film. There are a few really good documentaries available that provide more analysis and insight..watch them. Nonetheless, Ben Foster was pretty good. I thought he had talent when he was on HBO's Six Feet Under. Guilluame Canet, a fine French actor and director, was o.k. as the Italian Dr. Ferrara. There are other satisfactory performances, but the film itself may have taken on way too much, because editorially speaking, there is a lot of back n forth and jumping around, but such is the life of Lance Armstrong and such is the problem of trying to condense so much into a short feature length film. This production was more like a made for t.v. movie. In fact, there is so much Lance stuff, a mini t.v. series would have been the way to go. Steven Frears is a major directorial talent and if he couldn't pull this off then nobody can, because the Lance story is just so big, Lance's life is so big and what a life it is, no, really. And for me that is the take away of this film version...I do not condone nor judge what Lance and others did, including the peloton and cycling's governing bodies, I just come away in awe of this man's life. I really love him for having guts! But this film version isn't very good. The documentaries are the way to go...until we get a book from Lance taking us into his thinking and mindset both before, during and after his rise and fall. What is he thinking now? I suspect, he is thinking about how to compete again at something, anything.",1466380800,,1723,4.507987220447284

I actually F****ing hated his character so much, I couldn't even look at him as an actor lol! Then I was a little impressed with him in his co-staring role alongside Russel Crowe & Christian Bale in ""3:10 to Yuma"" he played I think Crowe's character's ""top guy"" or lieutenant if you prefer. Then I just noticed him in handful of other movies, he can be funny too. Overall though, I gained much knowledge of that whole unfortunate story. Armstrong seamed/seams like a decent, and super hardworking & dedicated to his craft type of guy. Sans the cheating obviously. I'd like to find out for sure how accurate the portrayal was, if Armstrong himself, feels that it was a fair assessment or does he or has he, shown disdain, for it, & didn't agree / or consult at all. Anyway I'll stop babbling now, 1 more opinion, is that while he did take whatever hgh, supplements, banned s*** etc., he is/was still a hell of a bike rider, not everyone would be able to ride half as good, EVEN IF THEY WERE on substances! Like baseball, yeah steroids, ok whatever, but, do you know how great some of the steroid baseball guys have to be, the ones that always had good batting averages? Substances or not, they DO NOT, enable you to time a 100 mph pitch and put the bat to the ball & put it in play!",1465689600,4,1444,4.371747211895911

7666028,4,B01BPQG3C6,"Really cool to see the Lance story with the inclusion of doping from the start. Since his admission of doping came out some time after his racing career had ended, the supporting documentation and findings were less in the news than they might have been a few years earlier. Because of that, it's hard to say how closely this film follows the truth of the history. But it seems close enough, is entertaining,and production values are good. Seems kind of odd that there's no mention of Linda, Lance's mom, since they were close. (Some would say unnaturally close.)

In an effort to keep the characters sympathetic, there is only a halfhearted attempt to show the co-conspirator's involvement in the Program.  It illuminates the guilty in the same moral light as the innocents caught up in Armstrong's web.

Strong performance by O'Dowd.  The expression on his face when he realizes Armstong is a doper felt uncomfortably reminiscent of my own reaction of disappointment.  Foster's Armstrong seems to coast along, moving along with the story, instead of creating it.  There is a genuinely touching interaction with a cancer stricken child which is played well, but Foster cannot summon the anger, chutzpah, and narcissism that was Lance Armstrong.",1465430400,2,851,5.079136690647482

7666057,5,B01BPQG3C6,A chilling portrayal of the Doping problem in  professional cycling. One must go into the movie with an open mind. Doping was the norm at this time not the unusal. Lance Armstrong was still the better cyclist do to his devotion and his training ethic. He found very early on he could not over come the norm and win. Had everyone been clean including Lance I have no doubt he would have had the same winning results. But the movie brings out some things I was not aware of after reading every book I could get my hands on on this subject. As an avid cyclist this entire situation was a true disappointment to say the least. I hope the doping problem is cleaned up once and for all.  I sincerely hope Livestrong Foundation will be able to continue to save lives and inspire Cancer victims to fight the fight.

Sad because those same fans were left with great disappointment.  In reading some of the other reviews of this movie, it is obvious Lance, in his desire to win in any way possible, deeply hurt the mass psyche of sports enthusiasts worldwide, especially in cloaking himself with the mantle of helping those with cancer.

Not only did make a mockery of the very sport he professed to love, he, also,made a mockery of his care for those who were sick and dying.  In the movie he appeared to be a sociopath.

It is my hope for him that he is able to come to terms with and heal the part of himself that is so wounded that he cannot feel the harm he does to others.",1465257600,3,836,4.265822784810126

I railed against those awful French who couldn't handle an American winning their precious Tour.  I was a cynic but Lance made me believe. Then I talked to a former pro cyclist who told me that they all doped and that Livestrong was just an excuse to hire scientists to beat the tests. I was crushed and barely watch the Tour anymore. This film succinctly showed how the world and I were duped by this guy. The cycling scenes crackle with energy and the landscapes are gorgeous.

7666108,3,B01BPQG3C6,"Low-budget production, story development was rather weak and seemed to skip many important details leading to key events. Lances character was also not portrayed very well, imo. He came across as a weak movie villain and not as a charismatic leader and mastermind narcissist that manged to out think and out dope the rest of the world for so long. The acting in general was a bit disappointing. Important characters such as Frankie Andreu and Betsy were only briefly portrayed and not given enough attention. Since it was based on Walsh book the movie seems to be more from his perspective and Walsh character was played well but his role was too dominant in the movie.

7666143,5,B01BPQG3C6,"I see poor reviews, here, but I actually thought Frears did a very strong job directing and Ben Foster played the character of ""Lance Armstrong"" as well as can be played.  Film was an excellent additional education on the matter.  I will say that I suspect that Armstrong was ""tuned-up"" enough in reality to where his tirades were off-the-charts, constantly, and maybe the film didn't capture that enough, though.

This is an aside, but sports where $$$ is involved are mostly hard work but also quite a bit of ""art"" -- BS, chemistry, whatever you can get away.  Young kids should know this going in when it comes to the pro-levels and the $$$.  I could have told people this in the 1970s.  And it's hard for people who know better to tolerate -- the rest of the public seems like fools.

My guess is Lance Armstrong  was ""educated"" through his exposure to more advanced, experienced racers (far more so than the film depicts).  And he became what he became -- a guy who was already damaged and frankly didn't care about what other damage he'd incur to himself to score the wins.

Major Armstrong errors:  Failing to quit while he was ahead and not taking care of his associates early on (sure Landis got busted, but he wouldn't have been ready to ding Armstrong if he'd had a bit of a financial cushion -- same for the other riders in Armstrong's USPS team).  These are holes that wouldn't have appeared if Armstrong had had better management and maybe more than a high-school education.  But, frankly, the drugs he was taking might have caused him to bulldoze through any common-sense that was imparted through those channels, also.  So...

Anyway, good film.",1464998400,2,1661,4.65979381443299

7666153,2,B01BPQG3C6,"If there's anything Hollywood loves, it's a rags to riches story. The only thing it likes better is the polar opposite: a fall from grace. The story of cycling champion Lance Armstrong's descent from hero to top heel due to a doping scandal has all of the ingredients to make an incredibly incisive, razor sharp story about athletics, celebrity, media, and more. It had everything. And yet Stephen Frears' ""The Program"" offers absolutely zero insight into Armstrong, who he was, or why he did what he did. It doesn't even offer up a compelling look at his cycling career, which begs the question: Why does this movie even exist?

It exists to give a platform to Ben Foster, one of the most underrated actors working today. It's unfortunately rare to find him in a lead role with this much potential, and yet the screenplay by John Hodge (Trance) offers him very little to sink his teeth into. The film begins in the '90s before Armstrong is...well, Lance Armstrong, when he's still a fresh-faced cyclist with a hunger to win and a sunny outlook on the sport. He's still clean, basically. But after being told repeatedly that he doesn't have the right body type to be a winner, Armstrong turns to sports doctor Michele Ferrari (Guillaume Canet) for a little bit of help. He begins by taking the drug Erythropoietin (or EPA), and it helps him gain his first significant wins. Just as his career was taking off, Armstrong was struck by testicular cancer that put everything on hold.

If Armstrong is known for anything, beyond being a liar and cheat, it's his desire to win. That drive gets him through brutal chemotherapy and the loss of a testicle. When he's recovered, he only wants to be champion more, turning back to Ferrari to help him do it. He assembles a team led by bullying manager Johan Bruyneel (Denis Menochet) to protect him as he wins Tour de France after Tour de France, all while on Ferrari's illegal doping regiment, which they call simply ""The Program"". But Armstrong's actions catch the eye of cycling enthusiast and journalist Dylan Walsh (Chris O'Dowd), who has been a fan of his since the beginning. His curiosity begins the investigations that would ultimately bring Armstrong down.

Here's the thing: most of this is swept through in about 30 minutes, with the film looking like a brief PBS documentary on Armstrong, not a feature-length biopic. We catch brief glimpses of key moment; Armstrong's victories, the cancer, drugs, suspicion, more drugs, betrayal, and finally it all goes up in smoke. There's very little attempt to connect the viewer with Armstrong's motivation, or to engage us with him or his supporters. That includes the under-utilized Jesse Plemons as Floyd Landis, who was key to exposing Armstrong as a fraud. There are characters who pop up in one scene, made to seem important, then simply vanish. Armstrong's wife is one such character. Why introduce her at all?

It suggests Frears and Hodge had no earthly idea what kind of story they wanted to tell about Armstrong, just that they wanted to make a movie about him while the time was right. Well, the time wasn't right and ""The Program"" definitely isn't the right film. Perhaps it's time to just close the book on Armstrong and let him fade into infamy where he belongs.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Program/dp/B01BPQG3C6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Program</a>",1463788800,28,3413,5.003521126760563

7666167,4,B01BPQG3C6,"""If we keep cheering loud enough maybe it will go away and no one will ever hear the unwelcome question. Is this real, or is it dope?"" Lance Armstrong (Foster) is the greatest cyclist in history. He wins the Tour de France year after year and has become the poster boy for the sport. Everyone loves him and is inspired by him and what he stands for. David Walsh (O'Dowd) begins to wonder how he wins so easily and suspects that it isn't legit. This is a story that everyone knows the basics of. What I didn't know was how early he was suspected, and how everyone wanted to hide it and not talk about it. Walsh really took heat for suggesting what was happening but stuck with it. Armstrong was as smooth as he could be in dodging and deflecting the questions about his use. I actually liked this movie a lot more than I expected to and even though it didn't really drop any bombshells it is still interesting and very much worth seeing. Overall, a movie that is entertaining and very much worth seeing even though everyone knows what happened. I actually recommend this. I give this a B.",1460160000,,1087,4.3861386138613865
7666168,3,B01BPQG3C6,"As a fan of most everything about this film, director Stephen Frears, Ben Foster, chris O'Dowd and professional cycling, I was disappointed.  This movie is, generally, we'll executed but lacks depth or soul.  It functions best when O'Dowd is on screen.
The script is two dimensional at best.  It is just the prescient heroic journalist vs. an overachieving evil cyclist.  The world of professional cycling and every cyclist represented is little more than a shallow cartoon version of reality.",1460160000,,493,5.2025316455696204
7666169,1,B01BPQG3C6,"Good thing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences doesn't ban actors and directors because this movie tests positive for bad acting and an even worse script. The central players appear as caricatures, with Ben Foster making annoying Hannibal Lecter grimaces throughout and lacking any of the charisma Armstrong could use so effectively. The players say 'the program' so often with great gravitas that it becomes comedic by the end. The worse part of all is that the writer/director decided to take the easy way out - Lance and his cronies were evil. It was a simple case of moral failing. This is an absurd notion. Doping in sport - like cheating in society - is an institutional, systemic, coordination problem. It's simple moral hypocrisy to take the moral high road in this case and condemn Armstrong. Moral situationists suggest most of us would have cheated too (just like most of us would have inflicted lethal shocks in Milgram's experiment). What of the corruption in the sport, commercial interests that used Armstrong when it was in their interests, and a public in denial? And if you're going to make a movie and not just a documentary - which this is without a coherent narrative - why not examine what drove Armstrong?",1460073600,4,1240,4.85377358490566
7666170,2,B01BPQG3C6,"After viewing this online, I now understand why this movie never got a theatrical release in the US. It's boring. Characters are poorly developed, acting is wooden, and even the cycling scenes are sapped of any energy or emotion.

There are probably two root causes of the failure of this movie.

 One is that the source material was David Walsh's book about Lance Armstrong. Walsh was instrumental as a journalist in covering the first dramatic arc of Armstrong's career -- his return to professional cycling after surviving cancer, winning the Tour 7 times, and surviving a legal attack on his reputation via the SCA lawsuit.  However, Walsh was not so close to the second arc of Armstrong's career -- his return from retirement, and the decision by Floyd Landis to spill the beans on Armstrong's doping and subsequent efforts of the FDA and the USADA to bring him down.  As a  result, the second half of the movie covers a lot of dramatic events, but doesn't really get into the drama of the situation.

The second problem is that the movie covered both parts of Armstrong's career -- just so much to cover, and so many incidents, that it felt like the movie had to ""check in"" on each major point for two minutes and then move onto the next.  I think it would have been a strong movie had it focused on only part of his career. I think the best choice would have been to start with his return from retirement, and the entire movie could have played out as a ""chase"" scene -- was Armstrong going to successfully win the Tour de France again before his many critics caught up with him? In the end, the drama to the last couple years of his career was whether, and how, the truth would come out. Anyone with half a brain knew he was guilty -- but it was not at all certain that he would get caught. The drama was all about how the story unfolded, and it was poorly told in this movie.",1459814400,2,1884,4.42485549132948
7666171,2,B01BPQG3C6,"Movie was fairly well done, Foster's performance was good but not great, however the story is just too old and worn out, most of us know everything that happened...nothing not seen in the other movies is seen here, its almost seems like a remake.

It should have hit harder on the fact that everybody else was doping too, the movie makes it seem like Lance won by cheating, which he did, but everybody else was doing it too, maybe he was better at cheating or better at competing!",1459468800,,480,4.454545454545454

That said, had I not seen the referenced documentary prior to seeing this film, I would have been completely lost at many moments during this movie.

And he did against a whole field of competitors that were doing the SAME THING HE WAS!!!

I was interested in finding out a little more of the Lance Armstrong story, and this looked intriguing from the trailer.  This is nothing but a stitched-together collection of dramatizations of snippets of Armstrong's life, and they don't even go together very well.  There no plot to speak of.  Scenes jump around in time only to display Armstrong's reaction to certain events, but other than the reporter and the physician, there is little time spent on anyone else.  I was really expecting this movie to be more like Shattered Glass, which chronicled the real-life rise and fall of a fraudulent reporter from The New Republic (a phenomenal film if you haven't seen it) in one cohesive narrative.  That movie developed Stephen Glass's relationships with his colleagues and brought a lot of emotional depth to the story being told.  ""The Program"" fails to do that on all counts (though the acting is very good, garnering a 1-star bump to my rating).
