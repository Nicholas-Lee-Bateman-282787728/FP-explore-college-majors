7965435,5,6305685436,"This is a film I had never heard of but took a punt at a local bootfair and ended up with a boxful of DVDs from Renown. I'm gradually going through them and so far, each one has been a black and white extravaganza, remastered to the highest quality.

A Brighton estate agent is burgled and all that is taken is a pile of lease agreements. The owner of the agent remembers the last lease and he and Detective Sergeant Wilks and Inspector Fellows (played by Jack Warner, a man who only ever seemed to act as a copper) drive a few miles east to Saltdean to talk to the female tenant. Whilst there, Wilks discovers a saw and a knife in a fire grate and thinks the worst. He's proved right when the pair uncover a dismembered body in a trunk. They have to piece together the pieces of the jigsaw.

Filmed on location in Brighton, this 1962 whodunnit is brilliant. It's black and white, which adds to the atmosphere, the environs play an integral part, the story (based on a real life murder) is superb and the direction is top notch. But what makes this and other films of the era stand head and shoulders above anything made in the last 40 years is that and you can actually hear every word spoken. There's no mumbling, no intrusive background music, just good, solid appearances by a plethora of character actors. The interrogation and reaction of the main suspects is top notch and makes you think you're really there.

Though these films are superior in every way to current offerings, in some ways it's all rather sad watching them. A time when the police knew and did their job, villains realised the consequences of being caught, and everyone didn't exist in a throwaway society. When did respect and good behaviour lose their way? Combined with some great shots of Brighton, a surprise ending (I was way out in my guess) and a cracking twist in the final 20 seconds, you'll be glued to every 100 minutes.",1463529600,4,1907,4.489913544668588
7965436,1,6305685436,"This movie reminds me of some old VHS tapes I have been tricked into renting which never made it into a theatre or even TV. Only buy it if you have trouble sleeping. It is boring beyond belief and the transfer quality is worse than a cable TV picture. Jigsaw is a good name for it - it looks like they made it in pieces and then threw darts to decide how to put the scenes together. It is sad that with so many good movies that haven't made it to DVD, someone chooses to market this kind of junk. I guess they only have to sell a few of them to turn a profit, since it looks like it cost nothing to produce.",979948800,5,607,3.903225806451613
