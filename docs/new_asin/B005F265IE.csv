4670726,5,B005F265IE,I can't believe you can get these four disc sets of such great old classics for such a low price! These films are timeless classics that are as entertaining today as the days they were filmed!  Fred & Ginger were absutely stunning as a dance couple & they still never fail to entertain!,1353542400,10,286,4.39622641509434
4670727,3,B005F265IE,"Don't expect Shakepearean plotting in these musicals - BUT - do expect to see Astaire & Rogers in their partnership debut in the supremely silly Flying Down To Rio.  What a great beginning!  And you probably don't remember the Castles (who does?) but the dancing in The Story Of... is enormously satisfying.  Any road, can you ever have too much of A&R?  Just grab a beverage, plop down, and watch Ginger keeping up with Fred (and in high heels!  and dancing backwards!)",1348963200,9,470,4.682926829268292

4670731,5,B005F265IE,Purchased as a gift and the recipient was very enthusiastic and enjoyed all of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers films on this DVD.,1329091200,2,132,4.541666666666667
4670732,5,B005F265IE,"You just don't get any better than Astaire and Rogers and this collection of four of their best is wonderful.  Very affordable and they have many extras.  I also enjoyed seeing a very young blonde Lucille Ball in two of the films, Roberta where she plays a model but gets no billing, and Follow the Fleet she plays Kitty Collins.  The dancing is so amazing at one point, my husband was watching and said, 'let's see them try that on 'Dancing with the Stars.'  Films of the thirties are a passion of mine, and this is a great way to round out my collection.  You can't go wrong.  I am so happy TCM collections are making these fabulous films available for a more affordable price.",1326067200,32,679,4.392
4670733,3,B005F265IE,"I'm pretty much copying the content of my review of volume one of this set in that I praise that one and pretty much have a so-so assessment of this one.

This volume is really for the completist. ""Flying Down to Rio"" and ""Roberta"" don't even star the pair. Gene Raymond and Delores del Rio star in the 1933 precode ""Flying Down to Rio"" and Ginger and Fred are fourth and fifth billed feuding - and dancing - members of an American troupe that is performing in Rio. Its main virtue is that it is a precode and therefore some of the lines and situations are priceless. ""Roberta"" stars RKO's queen of the lot at the time - Irene Dunne - and Randolph Scott before he found his niche in westerns. It's a good romantic comedy, but just don't expect too much of Fred and Ginger. ""The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle"" is the last film the duo did together for RKO and is ironic because, if the Castles are remembered at all today, it is because Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers played them in a movie. Plus, because the two are happily married in the film, you're missing all of the fun of the misunderstandings, squabbling, and sexual tension of their other RKO starring vehicles. ""Follow the Fleet"" stands alone in this set as one of the best that Astaire and Rogers did together. There's lots of great music and a good supporting cast. It's just too bad that in this second volume that there wasn't room for ""Carefree"", since it is one of the few films in which the plot has Ginger putting one over on Fred rather than vice versa.

4670738,5,B005F265IE,"I loved this collection of movies! ""Roberta"" was my favorite! After seeing these movies, I don't understand why Ginger Rogers ever needed Fred Astaire? She was really the one that held these movies together because she could act, dance and sing and he could only dance (bad actor, bad singer). But note that even though the pictures on the DVD cover are color, these are black and white---what a waste of all those beautiful gowns! Anyway, I recommend this highly--I really enjoyed these old movies even though ""Follow the Fleet"" was so bad; that's okay, still a lot of corny fun.",1503532800,,580,4.752475247524752

The only one with the trademark exquisite Fred & Ginger dancing is ""Follow the Fleet.""  The other three are major disappointments - the dancing is simplistic, pedestrian and forgettable.  I was particularly disappointed in ""Vernon and Irene Castle"" because it was a bio of a very popular turn of the century man and wife dancing team - I assumed the dancing would be show stopping. MAJOR disappointment - the dancing was so simple that I could've done it.  The saving grace of all four films is the terrific big band music.",1468886400,,623,4.6880733944954125

4670765,5,B005F265IE,"Although these four films may not compare to the first collection (The Gay Divorcee, Top Hat, Swing Time, and Shall We Dance), they are as enjoyable. It doesn't matter whether they receive top billing or not, the presence of Astaire and Ginger Rogers are invaluable in each film. In Flying Down to Rio (1933), Dolores del Rio is the main character, but the top performances are done by Astaire and Rogers. Both characters immediately show that they are very talented performers and actors at the same time. They reveal the comic qualities that will characterize them in their latter films. I enjoyed very much watching them dance the Carioca number, a very sensuous dance with Latin flavor. This is their very first dance in their careers together. During this dance, Astaire and Rogers show how playful they can be while dancing. They are accompanied also by a dance ensemble for the Carioca. Astaire also briefly dances with Dolores del Rio. This may not be a great movie, but it is good enough to watch for pleasure. In Roberta (1935) Astaire and Rogers get top billing along with Irene Dunne. I cannot miss Astaire and Rogers dance I'll Be Hard to Handle, which I consider one of their best dances ever, as they communicate through their dance steps. I found this quite fascinating. Irene Dunne gets to sing in this film. The music here is by Jerome Kerns. Follow the Fleet (1936) is probably my favorite in this group. Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dominate throughout the film. It is the only film where they know each other from the beginning of the story, and the only one where they don't belong to the higher class. Astaire is a sailor on leave and Rogers is a young hoofer working at a night club for a living. As Rogers' sister falls in love with Astaire's best friend, Astaire becomes a sort of match-maker for Rogers' sister. Rogers and Astaire dance to Irving Berlin's music once again.

As in the first volume, each film comes separately in its own disc. I really enjoy watching these over and over.",1463184000,8,2016,4.67887323943662

4670804,4,B005F265IE,"I liked watching the evolution of Fred & Ginger's dancing/acting, not to mention the changes in style.  The early Fred is stiff, the early Ginger sings too much (her voice is too whiny).  the first movie, Flying Down to Rio, makes you laugh with the poofy sleeves and scantily clad women on the wings of obviously stage-bound aircraft.

The stories are weak, the acting only so-so (they get better as you move forward in time).  It's how things were done in the 30s. But the old big-band songs are wonderful and the dancing entrancing.

The sound quality is good (as it can be), as is the video quality.

My reason for not rating this a 5?  It's not the mentioned acting and dancing and singing issues.  It's the packaging, which I detest.  There is single spindle with all the movies on it.  To watch moving #3, you have to pull movie #1,#2 off the spindle first.  I'd rather the cheap cardboard sleeves many collections resort to.  This is too much like buying a set of blank DVDs that someone pre-recorded.

Follow the Fleet is super charming
Flying Down to Rio has JUST enough of the pair to make it watchable.

Roberta is odd, no lie, but it has good moments.

Carefree is still missing :( so my Astaire/Rodgers collection is not complete.  Still looking for this film.  That one is great too.

Follow the Fleet has some really great moments. . . . all their films do really.  Definitely worth a shot if you haven't seen any.",1391817600,2,563,4.216981132075472

An error message said, ""Disk Dirty,"" and it just won't play. When I tried to exchange the faulty DVD, Amazon did not allow an exact exchange. Different items were offered for exchange, but I don't want anything different. I want this set to work. The DVDs are packaged such that the disks are one on top of the other, which damages the disks. You have to pull all the disks off the center holding piece in order to choose one disk from the set. The other option was to return the whole set and get a refund. I guess I'm stuck with three disks that work and one that I'll never see. It's a shame because I really love Astaire and Rogers. They were a class act.",1511740800,,806,4.1075949367088604
