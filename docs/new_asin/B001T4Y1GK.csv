8340532,4,B001T4Y1GK,A good primer for this synth...but I could have used more screen shots to see exactly what he's doing.,1413072000,,102,4.421052631578948
8340533,5,B001T4Y1GK,"Have not seen all of the video yet, but i watched video of david wills before and like the way he explains things.",1406592000,,114,4.0
8340534,5,B001T4Y1GK,"In short, awesome. The tutorial is nicely paced, and can be watched as a general overview, or paused so you can follow the steps nicely (and ensure that the what you see on your screen is what your instrument is displaying). The video gives you more than you will ever need, yet delivers it in a compact easy-to-understand package. More details can be obtained from the manual as required, and you are encouraged to experiment according to the specialization you want your Fantom G series workstation to deliver. The instructor used was the first instructor in the VHS video for the original Roland Fantom 76 first manufactured in 2002. He is very experienced, knowledgeable and expresses the material well.",1335484800,,707,4.949579831932773

This a must product for every one who has purchased Rolan Fantom G keyboard.
The training modules are just perfect, which targets both beginners and advanced users. The tutor has sound knowledge of the Fantom G product and the training helps a lot to understand the advanced keyboard techniques and enables us to use it effectively to produce great sounds & music...",1314144000,,399,5.0606060606060606
8340536,5,B001T4Y1GK,This video is well worth the cost.  The tutorials are well explained and is a great way to get started.  Each tutorial is accessible through the menus but I watched it from the beginning to the end.  It is at about mid level of experience.  If you know nothing about synth and sound recording I would not start here.  On the other hand if you are an expert and looking for precise details than this could be a little too general.  Its a good level of detail for me with average music and recording experience.  It covers all major capabilities of the Fantom G7.  The instructor is very knowledgeable and talented and the pace is quit good.,1252281600,5,639,4.401709401709402
