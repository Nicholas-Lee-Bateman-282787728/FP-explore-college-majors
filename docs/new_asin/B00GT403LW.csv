8627272,4,B00GT403LW,"It was a good show but way to short I thought it would have been a lot longer for what I payed it cost me 25.00 dollars and it was over so fast I was disappointed that there wasn't more, but I did enjoy it even though it was not long enough, Blake Shelton is a great country singer, and I also love him on the voice he has a wonderful personality he makes you laugh keep up the good work Blake love your music.",1423180800,,410,3.835294117647059
8627273,5,B00GT403LW,"This is definitely not your typical family Christmas program, but I laughed so hard during most of the skits, and I do every time I watch it! I have watched it several times since buying it last year!! Blake Shelton is a hilarious entertainer, but he has a beautiful voice, and every song performed is wonderful. Really cute to see his mom come out and sing the Christmas song she co-wrote with him, and very touching to see Miranda come out and end the show on a serious note with a lovely performance she does with her husband (who really is a big softy!).",1418860800,,558,4.375
8627274,5,B00GT403LW,"I saw this special on tv and it was so, so funny!  Blake is such a comedian and is so down to earth. His guest stars all did an outstanding job. I have been searching for this for a while and was lucky enough to find it at Wal-Mart for $5.00!!!!!! I highly recommend this DVD.  It is definitely not traditional Christmas, however, I promise that you will laugh a lot!",1418515200,,367,4.154929577464789

8627277,5,B00GT403LW,"I have been looking for this dvd since the special first aired.  I love Blake's warped sense of humor.  My favorite sketch or bit is the sendup of Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer Rankin Bass claymation with Larry The Cable Guy.  It is hilarious!  The bit about the Voice's spinning chair Blake is endorsing is very funny too.  I love the duet with Miranda Lambert HOME is heartfelt and beautiful.  I like it better than Michael Buble's version, and I'm a fan of both.  I like the duet with Dorothy Shackleford Time for Me to Come Home as well, although my wife doesn't think much of her voice.  I think it is pretty good in the harmonies.  Reba is always funny, and Blake has great rapport with Kelly Clarkson who is surprisingly very funny as well, on the singoff competition.  Jay Leno does a quick cameo and is pretty funny as well.",1394496000,,834,4.427631578947368
