But mostly what I detest is the politically correct underlying propaganda.

In one of the most infamous episodes Islamist terrorists are seen taking over the Saudi embassy. It turns out they are not Islamist terrorists at all but MOSSAD agents-in other words the writers of this series are pumping the conspiracy theory that 'Zionists' are the real perpetrators of Islamic terrorist atrocities such as 911 and 7/7-that the Islamists are innocent and being framed by the evil Jews...ooops 'Zionists'

In nearly every episode we are lead to BELIEVE that the terrorists are Islamists, but we always discover they are not, Islamists are being unfairly framed. The real culprits are always the Mossad, Sikhs, Amish, Christian pro-lifers, British Nationalists, you name it.
Muslims are always portrayed as cruelly treated and downtrodden victims of prejudice and exploitation. This show has a political agenda
In one episode a far right British political party, no to loosely based on the British National Party no doubt are the villains of the peace. Whatever you think of the BNP and I am not fan by any stretch, the BNP has never forced third world immigrants out of council houses. But in this episode our heroes visit pitiful and destitute Pakistani, Bengali and Somali families, forced out violently out of their council houses by thugs of the British Way.
Now the fact is that if anyone is forced out of council homes, schools, employment and hospital beds it it white working class or underclass people to make way for the very Third world immigrants , usually Muslim, being touted here as these hard done by.

But you would expect the propagandists to recognize this. It is a sad day when art becomes the tool of the ruling class to disseminate politically correct, pro-Islamist agitprop.",1359331200,7,1921,5.015673981191223

I am watching series 8 and have purchased series 9, and very much looking forward to purchasing series 10 when out on DVD.

One to buy.",1318464000,2,372,4.314285714285714
