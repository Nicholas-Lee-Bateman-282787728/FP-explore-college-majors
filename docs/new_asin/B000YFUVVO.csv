8232624,1,B000YFUVVO,"I have very little patience for Terrence Malick. He constantly breaks the first commandment of film - thou shalt not be a bore - by concentrating solely on the visual aspect of film-making. Days of Heaven, a film about people standing around in fields of wheat, is at least consistent with his style. Also, I am utterly convinced that the film was inspired by Christina's World, a painting created by Andrew Wyeth, and that I never would have had to sit through this drably colored time vampire if Malick had not seen the painting. I could be wrong. Perhaps he looked out a window once. Or saw a postcard of some Plains that looked Great.

The plot is stock, better handled in both The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity. The latter is brilliant and you should watch it instead. Or take a gander at the painting I mentioned.

I can't speak for the special features since I could hardly sit through the film itself.",1370390400,,927,4.578313253012048
