7823102,3,6302265886,"The second episode ""The Moonglow Affair"" was the reason for my purchase. It is superior than ""The King of Diamonds Affair"", but not to be argued in either case is the style quotient.

Enjoyable, but really for diehards:-)",1457308800,,221,4.815789473684211
7823103,4,6302265886,The King of Diamonds Affair and The Moonglow Affair are both second season episodes. The King of Diamonds has Ricardo Montalban back again after he played in the Dove affair in the first season. He plays a diamond thief with the help of a mafiya type gang to steal diamonds and transporting them in plum pudding. I love the Illya and Napoleon banter and Illya gets to do a lot. The Moonglow affair doesn't have much of Illya and Napoleon since they are stopped by a THRUSH ray projecter. Rookie April Dancer (Mary Ann Mobley) with the help of a veteran Mark Slate (Norman Fell) are assigned to stop THRUSH and retrieve the ray projecter to save Illya and Napoleon. This episode is the Girl from UNCLE pilot and the only episode with Mary Ann Mobley and Norman Fell to play April Dancer and Mark Slate.,985910400,9,801,4.493150684931507
