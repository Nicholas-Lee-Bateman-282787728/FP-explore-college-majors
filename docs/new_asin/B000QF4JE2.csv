8196069,5,B000QF4JE2,"In my top 5 of ""Greatest martial arts series of all time"", this sits squarely at #1, and the sequel ""Dragon saber Heavenly sword is a close second.
The shaw brothers told this story years before in a film called ""Little dragon girl"".It is a much abridged version of this story and is a great appetizer for this series. It is unmatched in visuals and storytelling. It is the epitome of ""Epic"". MUST SEE.",1481760000,,402,4.445945945945946
8196070,5,B000QF4JE2,"Haven't no bias ( not seeing the first one) part 2 was magnificent. Then I took a look at part one, i really wanted to see what it was like and the bias that came is the main character is different, but there are some same characters. Giving it some more thought watching it i felt great compassion for the first film as well. IT was indeed classic. So I have to say i love part 1 as much as i love part 2.",1279843200,3,406,3.8452380952380953
8196071,3,B000QF4JE2,"I suppose it is hard to write my opinion on this series, as I am already biased by watching the first part ""Legend of the Condor Heroes"".  The first series you are introduced to the characters, and after multiple episodes, they seem like old friends; in the second series, the story continues, but many of the actors have changed, especially in the main roles, and you keep comparing them to the first series.  Also, the people used to to dub the Cantonese into Mandarin are different, so even their voices are unfamiliar. The biggest disappointment was the replacing of the woman playing Rong (Yung Mei Ling), but unfortunately she died shortly after the first series ended she ""made"" the first series). The good news is that there are several other actors that remained in the series, and give it enough familiarity to connect the two parts together.

The story is fairly well written (but remember, this is a 1980's TV ""soap-opera"", so don't expect the quality of a major film in acting and special effects), with a balanced amount of drama, comedy, and of course- a lot of gung-fu!  The story is very slow going in the beginning, and not until the fourth or fifth disc does the story finally start to get interesting.  One other thing about this series (and I don't know whether I find it funny or annoying) is that a lot of the background music in the series is the ACTUAL soundtracks to Indiana Jones and Star Wars! No, not something that sounds like it, but the actual soundtrack!

My feeling is, if you watched the first part, you have to see how the story comes out in the end over several generations of characters.

So, good, but not as good as the first, but I have to remember that there is a third part coming, so we will see.  I will say though, the ending was very good (in this, it was better than the first).  The story came together, and gave you that warm feeling of satisfaction in the end.",1243900800,6,1911,4.5
