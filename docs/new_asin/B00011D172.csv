1966086,5,B00011D172,"This is so good!  for bar method beginners...  Intermediates can add this on to their cardio for some toning and stretching.  I use it as a cool down after stepping because it really shapes your body.  I love Burr, and I'm anxious for some advanced tapes to come out.",1092268800,7,267,4.387755102040816
1966087,4,B00011D172,"I really knew nothing about these DVD's and just randomly chose them from amazon.com.  It was only after I ordered that I saw a review in Self that gave the Fat Free DVD a great review.  So I wanted to see for myself.
The most motivating factor in doing these exercises is seeing Burr (who is in her late 50's and looks AMAZING!) and three other women from various backgrounds do these exercises and look good doing it.  They promise you'll start seeing results after 10 workouts, and you are supposed to do this workout 3 times a week.  I really have trouble doing it more than twice a week, but the DVD's contain bonus workouts which are shorter and are easier to squeeze in when you're low on time.
You don't need much equipment for these workouts: 3-5 lb. dumbbells, a sturdy chair, and a strap (like a bathrobe belt) for doing leg stretches.  So that was nice too...I already had all the equipment at home.
The workout goes by fast.  45 minutes is over before you know it.  The only complaints that I really have is that the exercises are very similar between the two DVD's...I would've liked a little more variety to prevent the boredom that will eventually come from doing these workouts over and over.  And Burr is encouraging and motivational, but can sometimes be annoying.  I would just prefer that she instruct in the proper form for the exercises and remind you to breathe on occasion and leave it at that.  The words of encouragement she speaks seem kind of forced and strange.
But after using this for a few weeks now, I am beginning to see a difference.  I don't expect a dancer's body, since I am rather short with stubby legs, but I can already tell that I'm a bit leaner.  Although I would suggest doing cardio in addition to this, since you're not getting a cardio workout here (I do cardio at least twice a week in addition to these DVD's).",1080864000,91,1861,4.457227138643068
1966088,5,B00011D172,"I absolutely love these two DVDs.  I am a dancer and aspiring model who wants long, lean muscles, and the Bar Method definitely delivers.  I have been alternating the two every night for 2 weeks now and I am incredibly happy with the results.  My tush is tighter and the cellulite is dissappearing, my arms are skinnier, my calves have sexy definition, my abs are super flat again, and my legs look better.  I love that you only use your own body weight as resistance (except for the arms in Designer Sculpting when you use 1-4 lb weights), this prevents bulky muscles. Fat Free focuses more on ab and butt work while Designer Sculpting has a more intense arm section.  Both provide a good 45 min total-body workout that is not to strenuous, but definitely works as the moves are isolated and tiny but very intense.  I also like that after working each muscle group, you stretch to keep the muscles long, plus it feels incredible.  You still need to do cardio as well as the DVDs if you want to lose weight.  I am [so] excited for summer since I know Burr going to make me bikini-perfect.  Bring on the minis!  Burr is so encouraging and nice, I ""click"" with her.  My nightly workout has become a ritual for me, a time for me to focus on my body and release the stresses of the day, and I have, as Burr promises,  become addicted to the deep-muscle feel of the Bar Method!",1080345600,23,1372,4.379446640316205
1966089,5,B00011D172,"This is a good workout for all levels. I've been working out for a while, but I can do this set with my beginner friends.

1966102,5,B00011D172,"I lift weights four days a week and one day with a trainer. I purchased this video because I was looking to add some variety to my bodybuilding and treadmill workouts. Wow! does this deliver! Even with strength training I do, this video had my muscles burning. I wouldn't have made it through without the wonderful stretches she does after each exercise. That's not to say it's too difficult for a beginner either.

There are great modifications shown and no impact. Anyone could do this, but be ready to focus on the muscles & form if you want to feel the burn and get the results promised. If this workout feels easy or boring, your not using  proper form.",1217462400,11,658,4.5210084033613445
1966103,5,B00011D172,"This is a great slimming, toning workout.  By the third workout I noticed my thighs, especially my inner thighs contouring and reshaping.  I definately felt it in my buns the next day and feel that lifting as well.  I do alternate the Bar Method with my other DVD's since I feel that I need more cardio.  I tend to get bulky with my legs, so this workout will slenderize your legs and make them leaner looking.  My sister and I inquired if they will be making new Bar Method DVD's and they are in production this month of July 2008 and will be coming out in the Fall of 2008.  Well that is what they say.  I will be definately purchasing their new DVD's since I know that Burr came out with some new excercise positions that are not in the older DVDs that came out in 2003.",1215993600,9,773,4.1824324324324325
1966104,5,B00011D172,The Bar Method is by far the best program I have used to date. I did see excellent results within 10 days. I enjoy exercising with this program and I like the way she helps you precisely target each muscle. You can feel results after each session. WHY IS THIS DVD PROGRAM NO LONGER BEING PRODUCED!? This is such a shame. I would feel awful if one of my Bar Method DVDs got damaged.,1212192000,6,381,4.162162162162162
1966105,5,B00011D172,"These two DVDs offer a great workout in a short amount of time (45 minutes each). I really found that they changed my shape immediately! The instructions are clear, and the exercises are varied enough that the time passes quickly. It's an intense workout, extremely similar to the Lotte Berk workouts, where you exhaust the muscles, stretch, and move to the next muscle group. They improved my posture, and I really dropped a belt loop after only three sessions. I recommend the Bar Method, and the Lotte Berk Method DVDs as well.

I do want to note that over time, I found that these workouts reduced my flexibility quite a lot. I suppose you could add some stretches to overcome this drawback.",1209945600,7,695,4.69672131147541
1966106,5,B00011D172,"Highly, highly recommended. You will feel this for the next day or two. I was running regularly and felt that I needed to tone up more, and this has been really amazing. My main problem area is the back of my thighs, and a lot of exercise DVDs do not really cover this area (you'd be surprised...not even Callanetics, which is otherwise also great).

Main complaints I've heard are that Burr Leonard, the instructor, is irritating, the pacing is too fast and there's not a lot of help counting, and that the music is hilarious. Burr is perky in a slightly disturbing way but you can get over that when you have learned the exercises so you don't need to pay as much attention. (This also takes care of the issue with the counting. Most are sets of ten. If the pace is too fast, pause and continue at your own pace. It's a DVD! This is why I prefer it to a class, where I can make a fool of myself.) I don't even notice the music really - this is an intense workout.

If you don't want to pay an insane amount of money, I found my set (new!) at olivefilms dot com. I'm otherwise faithful to Amazon but paying nearly two hundred dollars for this seems silly.",1208563200,10,1156,4.25
1966107,5,B00011D172,"I decided to try the videos before my wedding seven months ago to tone my stomach, arms and legs. I did the workout for 4-5 times a week for a month before my wedding and I looked and felt fabulous. I stopped the workout after the wedding because of time/work but recently picked it back up. It's been 2 weeks and I can see a small difference. I am making more of an effort to continue with it now.
Also, I am a person that hates going to the gym and workout classes, so these videos are great for me. I am amazed that it only cost $25. One class in the San Francisco Bar Method studio costs more than $25. I definitely received my money's worth.",1203033600,5,646,4.094488188976378
1966108,5,B00011D172,"I started using this program in the Spring.  I tried both DVDs, and I found that for the legs and behind, they are unbeatable.  The arm and abs exercises are not worth doing.  I have maximized my use of the 2 DVDs by choosing the exercises that work quickly, as well as my preferred stretches, and incorporating the lot on a single DVD using DVD Shrink (freeware).  I also ripped the final DVD to extract only the sound, and further cut out the author's endless chatter (using dvd2avi, and Audacity: freeware), adding a wonderful Callanetic series of stretches at the end, and added the compressed file to my iPod Shuffle, the one that clips on to clothing and is super light.  The only evidence of my early morning exercises is my groaning because of the intensity of the exercises.  My husband says that I have never looked so good, and that is saying plenty: I'm 56.  I have many exercise DVDs, but these combined DVDs are short and sweet and they deliver:  10 minutes plus final stretches.  What more could a woman want?",1192406400,6,1024,4.551912568306011
1966109,5,B00011D172,"I have had this for a two months.  After working out for approx six weeks, my leg strength has improved.  I have weak knees.  I carefully followed her instructions.  I made sure to modify it to accomodate my limitations and found that my knee strength has actually improved.  My muscles are firmer and my thighs are trimmer.  I have bulky muscles from years of weight training.  In the last year, I have taken to working out with ballet bar/pilates type training.  This workout is effective and can make a difference in leg shape without compromising leg strength.  It improves flexibility and it has helped me in my posture as well as bettering my center of gravity.",1191024000,4,667,4.681034482758621
1966110,4,B00011D172,"I have been exercising regularly for about a year and have purchased many exercise videos in that time.  Since I get bored easily I'm always looking for something different to try and I found it with the Bar Method Body.  These workouts are not your typical strength training videos and after doing  one the first time I wondered if I had gotten a workout at all.  After completing Designer Sculpting I wasn't breathing hard, sweating, or tired but within hours I knew that I had indeed worked some muscles.  With other strength training videos I had been using 8 lbs for tricep  kickbacks, here I was using 3 lbs and felt it more afterwards.  The exercises work deep in the muscles using very small movements but are very effective.

I've only done the tapes a few times so I can't say that I've seen a difference in my body yet but I have certainly felt the workouts.  I'll add to my review after doing them for a few more weeks.  I hope to look like Burr Leonard one day soon.",1190592000,5,979,4.388888888888889

1966122,5,B00011D172,I tried this DVD due to the extensive great reviews and I must say this has been one of my favorite workouts I've ever tried. If you want to be more flexible and have a leaner toned body check this out. You'll really feel the burn. But before I do this workout I do at least 10 minutes on my eliptical trainer you'll feel the results the next day but don't give up! I also recommend blending this workout with the 20 minute windsor pilates workout its a great combo especially if your crunched on time.,1188604800,,502,4.239583333333333

1966125,5,B00011D172,"I love it!!! After waiting for soooo long for it to arrive in the mail, it came today!!! I tried out the fat burn and burn it did!! I was shaking half way through and was wobbly afterward. The entire experience was great. I have a short attention span and even shorter when it comes to working out. I will turn off a tape after 3 minutes if I am not interested, but I stuck through the entire 45 minutes. I looked up at the time and 20 minutes had passed!!! I used a chair and a belt as substitutes for the bar and band and it worked fine. You basically can take this on the go and keep yourself in shape. I have one month to lose some extra baggage, so I plan to alternate the tapes every other day and hopefully I can see some quick results. Burr is so encouraging and right when you feel like you want to quit or stop, she stops and gives you a break and coaxes you into the exercises. Overall I love it!!! I'll try to check back in a couple of weeks and let you know my results! Bri",1180137600,2,986,3.959798994974874
1966126,5,B00011D172,"These two videos are wonderful. I actually look forward to doing them and want to do one each day. I have two very small children and finding the time is hard. But I have managed to do it 3-4 times a week so far for 3 weeks. My kids actually let me do these videos and play around me while I am doing them. They are like yoga with callesthetic elements. I can FEEL them working already!

For many years, I stopped exercising because I thought I needed  a life altering/join-the-gym kind of change. But these videos have shown me that change can happen in small steps each day, without all the hoopla and sweating and exhaustive work!

I now look forward to exercising and have a new perspective on it. Through these two videos and Ally McGraw's yoga video, walking and some weight training, I can easily see a healthier, happier future ahead of me. The best thing about all this is that it WORKS with my life. Even with two kids aorund me at all times, I can fit these videos in and what a difference they have made!

So try it. The Bar Method really is wonderful. Plus, it's great for backpain. My back feels so much better and I am actully taking less tylenol than I used to!",1179446400,5,1177,4.288288288288288
1966127,3,B00011D172,"I checked out this DVD after hearing wonderful things from people who have taken classes at Bar Method studios in CA. While in-studio Bar Method classes may offer a challenging workout to people who already have good all-over strength and flexibility, these videos really don't. I kept wondering, ""when does the workout begin?"" My heart rate never broke 90, and I wasn't tired afterwards like I am after running or biking, or floaty and relaxed like I am after yoga or Pilates.

Paradoxically, the moves in these videos seem like they'd be painful for people who are completely out of condition and have the catalogue of injuries, back pain and joint aches from which out-of-shape people suffer. There are plenty of good, gentle yoga and pilates tapes that would give them better results with less pain.

That said, these DVDs might be a good addition to the exercise routines of runners and cyclists who blow off stretching and upper-body work because it's boring. The Pretzel alone was well worth the price of the DVDs; it works the neglected piriformis, a muscle that can act up and cause sciatic pain. Working through these videos a few times a week would help to prevent injuries.

The Bar Method DVDs would probably be ideal for healthy, uninjured people who have been meaning to sign up for a martial arts class but have put it off because they don't have the muscle strength, flexibility or endurance to make it through a kung fu class without pain or exhaustion. Once you've practiced these workouts until you can make it through them without wanting to collapse, a beginner's kung fu class will still be challenging, but you'll have the fitness base and confidence to complete the workout and not feel absolutely shattered the next day.",1178236800,11,1746,4.832775919732441
1966128,5,B00011D172,"These are two great workouts.  Gets the whole body toned.  Nothing like making your body work with it's own weight.  Goes by quick.

1966145,4,B00011D172,"With the Bar Method workout tapes you can feel the effects right away. Seeing them, is a completely different story. It seems as if it tones and sculpts underneath the more fatty areas, rather than reduce the fat while it tones despite the title of the second tape ""Fat Free"".

As far as my arms were concerned, they looked like Burr's after about a week and a half lol. (I did the workout 6 times a week rather than the 3 suggested). However, my legs were another story entirely. I have somewhat thick thighs (runner thighs) and that's where  the cellulite hides out so I was ready to work them out as much as necessary. No doubt I felt the burn and muscle tighten up underneath the fat. But this workout alone didn't do anything to burn fat away on top.

I integrated parts of Burr's workout into my weight training routine and started running again...NOW I can see the difference in my legs.

All in all, I believe that if you just need some toning and you're already pretty close to the slender category, this is for you. You can use the Bar Method alone and see results. But if you have some meat on your bones that you want trimmed down first, you should try walking daily before you do this workout. Walking is a non-impact warm up too!",1172188800,13,1243,4.367965367965368

1966148,5,B00011D172,"I love this workout.  Not only does it energize you and make you feel long and lean, but you definitely see results very quickly.  It looks really easy, but holding a squat position on your tippy toes for a few beats really gets your legs shaking.  It is very similar to callanetics--which I really tried to do since I hear the results are just as good, but i found that to be very boring.  Bar Method is NOT borning, the time flies and the results are amazing.  DS starts with light weights for your arms.  You do bicep curls, shoulder raises and tricep lifts--they are really hard if you focus on your form.  Then you do a few leg exercises using the bar--plie pulses and pelvic tucks, both really make your legs shake and burn.  You then move to the floor for the pretzel, which will make your bum lift and tighten after only doing once, but it's hard to get the form right so make sure to only do what you can until you're strong enough.  Then you do curls (ab work) again seems really easy, but if you do it like they say it kills.  Last you bridge work (they call it seat dancing).  In Fat Free you start with pushups and tricep dips, then tons of leg work on the bar--you do both leg and seat work--it's really hard and I am dying by the time it's over, then you do ab work and seat daincing. I alternate the workouts and do it 3 times a week and in only one month i see definite improvement in my bum and my thighs.  Both workouts are relatively the same--as far as body parts worked they are both total body--but they compliment each other and I really feel you need both to make progress.  You should definitely get this and you will see great results really quick.  Good Luck!",1171238400,10,1687,4.23125

1966166,5,B00011D172,"The Bar Method exercises have been such a great investment as I find myself doing them on a weekly basis. Derived from the Lotte Berk Method, these mostly ballet and pilates-inspired movements in combination with calisthenic exercises, will especially work your thighs and seat muscles in a way that classic squats and lunges alone simply can't. The abdominal portions are especially effective - becoming increasingly challenging as you progress and build more strength in your core. It is especially important to get your form right when doing these exercises to really reap all of its potional effects, and Burr Leonard does an excellent job with her insctruction and queing. The arms portions consists of pushups and tricept dips on ""Fat Free,"" and the use of light weights on ""Designer Sculping,"" which are quite challenging due to their uniquely straight alignment. The music is pleasantly upbeat throughout, with Enigma-like ""cool-down"" music at the end of both DVDs which is absolutely wonderful! The series of stretches between each exercise and final stretch promote overall flexibility and rejuvination. Overall, these are amazing workouts consisting of many small, isometric movements that work deep in your muscles to help create a more cut, lean look.",1167350400,16,1264,5.325

I'm fairly athletic and active and have been my whole life and this was super challenging for me and continues to be 9 months later. I think anyone who says it isn't difficult isn't doing the moves right (I mean, it's a ballet workout--are they saying dancers don't work hard!?!).

With her long, lean physique, she looks incredible. I don't know if the Bar Method is all she does to stay in shape, but judging from this DVD set, it must help. The approach is part Lotte Berk, part dance-inspired (Leonard, in fact, studed the Lotte Berk method in the 1980s), and the workouts are way tougher than they look. This exercise style relies a lot on small, subtle movements that, if done properly, are highly effective.

I watched the DVD before trying it, and thought, ""This will be a piece of cake!!!""  The workouts seemed so simple; tiny pulses, tiny tucks, barely lifting the leg.  Boy was I wrong!!!  My first time doing it, my standing leg was shaking so badly I almost fell to the floor.  Those tiny pulses really dig deep and are not for the faint of heart!!

I find myself doing the leg/seat and ab sections only.  The upper body portions just don't do it for me.  (Hence my 4 out of 5 star review).  But if you are looking to work your lower body like never before, this is the workout for you!

This is, in my opinion, a great advantage when following the exercises on the DVD because you know exactly what the teacher means by 'tuck in' or 'push the hips forward but keep the back straight' and so on.

Also the 45mins are over pretty soon, it does not get boring :)

The bonus material on this DVD allows you to do the exercises without the teacher speaking, also it contains extra workout exercises.

My chest lifted, my shoulders tightened, my arms became long and lean, my back became flat and sculpted, my stomach curved in, and my legs lengthened and sculpted.  My hips shrank and my saddle bags have gone! And I have a tight firm butt! I am so pleased and happy with my results that I want to open a Bar Method studio.  I am so committed, loyal and faithful to these workouts.  I do both Fat Free and Designer Sculpting three times a week.  They really challenge me and I sweat like crazy.  I love feeling the burn and am sore the next day but I have dropped inches, pounds, health problems, and disease thanks to these.  I started these when I was over 300 pounds and modified and I could still do it! Do this.  It really works!",1127433600,67,1003,4.344086021505376
1966190,5,B00011D172,"This DVD set ranks on top of all my fitness videos I own for one big reason: I'm actually getting some great results QUICKLY. I'm now addicted to these type of exercises and loving every minute of it. I still have a lot of weight to lose, but these exercises are making me look good now!

The Bar Method exercises are deep muscle, non-impacting, very precise exercises that nearly everyone can do. Beware, because the exercises are precise YOU WILL FEEL THE BURN VERY QUICKLY, especially the exercises that target the hips, thighs, and buttocks. The movements are small, but have lots of repetitions. By the time you reach your last rep, if you last that long, you will be begging for mercy. As you increase your endurance, you may want to repeat certain chapters of you favorite exercises to maximize your potential. After each set of exercises, you will do deep stretches that will feel oh-so good. Oh, yes, modifications are shown for beginners (or for those less flexible) so they won't miss out on the exercises.

The tools you will need to do these exercises are two lightweight dumbells (for Designer Sculpting), a strap, and a barre. If you don't have a barre, a sturdy chair or piece of furniture will do nicely. Two participants in the video work with a chair.  The barre is needed mostly to keep your balance; you will not be leaning on it for support unless your severly balance impaired.

Designer Sculpting is my personal favorite. There's lots of intense deep seat work on this one. Fat Free is not as deeply intense (don't get me wrong - it's still intense), yet its a wonderful full body workout that totally compliments and finishes off what's done on DS. Very few of the exercises are repeated in each workout, so you won't be doing the same old thing in each video. Designer Sculpting is concentrated, deep sculpting work; while Fat Free goes a bit faster and tightens the body up.

I found Burr Leonard very enjoyable to workout to. She's an older woman, in her late fifties as she states in her videos, who has a great, youthful looking body. She's friendly, sweet, a bit peppy, and not overbearing. I chuckle everytime she says, ""Ten more, and then we'll break."" At that point, I'm usually in deep burn, so I wonder to myself - ""Does that mean we're going to stop or just shatter?"" Maybe it's both.

Again, the one thing that has me totally sold on these videos is the great results I've gotten in such short amount of time. I did these videos 3 times a week for 2.5 weeks and then took a few days off being lazy. I few days later I was shocked to find my rear end looking noticeably better! I wasn't even looking to improve that area - I kind of gave up hope on it until after I would have lost all 45 lbs. But, this was the first place it showed up. Even my husband noticed (and loves it!) without being prompted. I've continued to do these exercises, alternating as of lately with Callanetics to avoid boredom. Now, 2.5 months later, my behind has completely changed and is still improving! It's nowhere near what it used to be and I love it! Poor eating habits have kept me from losing the weight I want to lose (I was losing weight gracefully until I fell off the proper eating habits bandwagon), but Bar Method has kept me looking great despite. I'm 35 years old and have renewed hope for changing my body now that I know about the Bar Method and other videos of the like. Thanks, Burr, for coming out with these videos and opening my eyes to these truly effective exercises!",1120003200,192,3504,4.4929356357927785
1966211,5,B00011D172,"Don't bother with anything else - this is it.  If you want serious change in your body, this is what will do it for you.  The moves are simple, though it may take a try or two to get the hang of the basic form (the ""tuck"").  Once, you do, it's a breeze.  The variety makes the time fly.  The first time I tried these DVDs, I was skeptical that they would do anything for my body because the moves are so small and simple.  I was astounded with the results.  Doing these exercises shattered my weight plateau, brought me to my target weight and measurements within three weeks, and has increased my overall health, energy, and happiness.  If you care at all about getting and staying fit, this is the product for you.  Anyone can do it.  There is even a modified version of each move designed to accommodate those with back problems.  My experience with the Bar Method has been phenomenal.  I feel more in touch with my body than ever, and I really enjoy exercising now.  I don't have to force myself to work out - I really want to.  Take it from me - I've tried every diet and exercise regimen imaginable.  This is the only one that has given me the results I wanted - mind, body, and spirit.  Do yourself a favor.

You can become much more uplifted and cut than with Pilates, (which I like for its more rehabilitative properties). Burr really works the entire body and people will definitely notice your slimming legs and trunk! This is a definite improvement on the original Lotte Berk moves.",1114473600,9,433,4.864864864864865
1966213,5,B00011D172,"This is a very intense workout full of very small, yet tough moves that will definitely shape those trouble fat zones we all hate so much like hips, saddlebags, thighs, waist and lower abdomen, arm jiggle and bra rolls. The instructor is in her late 50's and she looks amazing!! That's one of the things that motivated me the most.

The first DVD I did was Fat Free. In here you will do exercises like push ups, standing exercises like the ones performed in a dance class on the bar, except you don't need a bar, you can use a sturdy chair and then you move on to do floor exercises that will kill your abs, butt and thighs...

The second DVD, Designer Sculpting, in my opinion, is more intense than Fat Free. You will work your triceps very intensely and you will be sore the next day. You will also do the famous pretzel move which will make your waist and butt burn. You will also work your abs and thighs and at the end your body just feels really nice and tight.

These workouts are very intense, they require a lot of concentration and focus BUT they are not overly strenous, you will not find yourself gasping for air or on the verge of passing out.... so this is good for beginners as well as advanced exercisers. It's all about how much you put into it. I even broke a sweat, this really gets your legs shaking!! And because they are just 45 minutes, they're easy to fit into a tight schedule.

So far, I have done these workouts twice and I can tell you I already see a very subtle difference!! No wonder people are raving about this! You will definitely see your abs flattening out, and your thighs getting leaner, your butt will begin transforming into a sexy, perky, little tight dancer's butt and your hips will narrow down. Not to mention your triceps and entire arm and upper body will be toning up significantly. Maybe I am seeing a difference so quickly because I am already in ok shape and I workout regularly. But you're supposed to see results anyway in 10 workouts IF you stick to it and do the DVD's 3 times a week. If you need to lose weight you will definitely have to add at least 3 days of cardio per week, otherwise doing this by itself ain't gonna cut it. So if you're not doing cardio, and have extra pounds, don't expect to see a big difference. You have to burn that extra layer of fat in order to reveal the nicely and newly shaped muscle underneath.",1114473600,26,2383,4.324384787472035
1966214,5,B00011D172,"Tuck, tuck, tuck and when you are about to start the moves, tuck again. This is really what you must perfect and remember as you do these exercises.

When I first started TBM in late February, I loved it right away because of the intense stretching and the feeling of elongation but I didn't really consider it an intense workout. The moves looked so simple and effortless. I really didn't feel very much in terms of having worked my body. I didn't feel I'd done anything strenuous, I didn't break a sweat, I wasn't breathing heavily (or hyperventilating, which is the usual gauge) and I was smugly confident that this workout would simply complement the other DVDs I was doing on off days. I felt absolutely fine.

Until the next morning. Then I felt as if every major muscle in my body had been *zapped* Oh, yes. These workouts are beyond intense. You'll hear from muscles you never knew you had and you'll soon begin to see striations in the muscles you were aware of but had pretty much given up on toning. Like the thighs, hips and around the tummy. These are notoriously difficult to sculpt. The tummy is the last area of fat/flab to pack up and go because you've got to target the diet first but wow! If you press on your tummy, what you feel beneath is rock hard. (If I can just diet the overlying fat away, I'll see some impressive abs)

I've lost 10lbs and my clothes are fitting so much better! I can't wait to see how my body changes over the summer. Nothing else has ever given me the results I've had with the sculpted and elegant Ms. Burr Leonard so I'm sticking with her.

The tricky (and clever) thing about this workout, particularly in Fat Free, is that the stronger you become, the more difficult you find the exercises because you're dipping lower, holding your bodier steadier (because you're stronger) and you're internally making the work deeper. You no longer will default to taking the easy/less painful way through the workout because it's so wonderful. I can't understand how something so intense and challenging is simultaneously relaxing and exhilarating but it is. It's very clever and the instructor is so soothing, genial and nonthreatening, even when she's doing really challenging work, you feel as if you really CAN do it.

 The weights are very light, she's using about 3 pounds I think (although the ladies in live studios are very competitive and brag/show off to each other about the weights they're using, up to 5lbs :rolleyes: ) but don't laugh because you are using such strict posture and form, they feel heavier. There are only about 4 exercises in which she uses the weights but you really feel it the next day.

The basic difference between the two DVDs is there is more emphasis on lifting the butt in DS (there is a move called the Pretzel that is kick butt and will lift your bum and work your obliques simultaneously). The core workouts are the same. I think DS is much easier than FF.

And these DVDs are beyond addictive! Thank goodness there are plans in the works for more DVDs and a book! Of course, I'll be all over it ...

I do them every day, sometimes twice per day alternating between them. I had frequented Bally's, done Tae Bo Advanced Ripped series, The Firm, Cathe Friedrich, you name it and I'd done it and more over the last 2 1/2 years and nothing, absolutely nothing has made the changes I've noticed during the last 2 MONTHS of TBM. So I'm definitely an advocate, addict and unabashed devotee.

I'd just tell you to try them. Don't underestimate the seemingly simplistic moves. They'll get you the following day. And then you'll be back again and again. It works.",1113436800,46,3633,4.592592592592593

It works fast if you do it 3+ times a week - you will see & feel the difference after the first week.

I know these work because I own an ancient copy of the original Callanetics video and the complete set of Lotte Berk videos. They are all similar in the way the exercises are done with very small pulses or contractions and produce very great and noticable results even after a few workouts.  What makes this DVD better is that you get a full body workout in one DVD unlike Lotte Berk in which there is a seperate dvd for each target zone. Callanetics is great but really outdated to watch.

I really do believe it is an effective way to sculpt and tone long, lean muscles (I usually supplement the upper body workout because it's so short). I checked out Fat Free from the library just for kicks, to have another DVD in the rotation for awhile.

The good:
As always, Burr's cueing is good. The production value is fine and the music isn't distracting or annoying. I felt enough of a burn during most of the exercises to not have made doing the workout a complete waste of time.

The bad:
It's simply not as thorough a workout as any of the other DVDs I've ever done of The Bar Method. The upper body work consists of a couple sets of push-ups and some stretches. That's it. There are no calf raises. Each section seemed substantially shorter and less strenuous than DVDs that were released later. I didn't get that trembly, Jell-o leg feeling I've come to crave from The Bar Method. And lastly, my back is totally killing me after completing it, which is never the case with the other DVDs I do.

So uh, yeah. I would really check out any other Bar Method DVD before checking out Fat Free. My favorites are Super Sculpting and Dancer's Body.",1395100800,2,1210,4.392857142857143

I now adore barre workouts, and I can thank these little gems for a solid foundation for barre work.  Instructor Burr Leonard cues amazingly well, taking time to set you io tor success, giving instruction for key little tweaked to form.  She won't leave you guessing about any angles or what muscles you are working - or why you are working them.

I was amazed to find these held good on their promise that you'll start yo see changes in ten workouts.  It was actually less!  These have made the greatest positive influence on my thighs!  I thought it would be impossible to ever even ""not Hate"" my thighs.  Burr proved me (happily) wrong.

I love the ladylike toughness of barre work.  I love the barefoot quality.  I love the hint of ballet.  I love the results.  And if you are going to try barre--you have to try Burr and her Bar Method.  She will set you up tor success with good form (knowledge is power).

Get them at dvdbyte.com for $30 for the set.,1295308800,4,332,4.061538461538461
8005297,5,B00011D172,"I've read other reviews where people say Burr's voice is ""annoying"" or they're bored with these workouts. Personally, I do not suffer from either, but perhaps it is because I have decided to LISTEN to her, and DO the WORK - she is there to remind us to use good form. And I NEED TO KEEP HEARING HER HELPFUL GUIDANCE! Since I've started really paying attention and actually doing what she says to do I've noticed better results. As well, she is a consummate professional, very organized and prepared, and not at all high-strung or giggly or grating. She smiles and encourages, and it feels like she's welcoming me to join the gorgeous-muscle crowd; extending an invitation to improve my individual body.

As well, Burr does not shove any other products down your throat. No barre at home? Use a countertop or sturdy chair. Use any old light dumbbells for the arm work (she recommends 1-4 pound weights). A terry cloth bathrobe belt works great for a stretching strap. (So does a nice soft winter neck scarf.) And there's NO DIET PLAN. NONE. You're on the honor system diet-wise. Do what works best for you. (Here's mine: Drink lots of water, go easy on the sugary treats, get ample lean protein, whole foods are good... oh, and get enough sleep.) Burr doesn't even mention diet. It's GREAT.

Also, once I did the workouts a few times, I was familiar with the progressions and instead of doing the beginner set-up thing along with her, I now get into position quickly and start doing the reps I know are coming before she does on some exercises. I get anywhere from 2 to 20 extra reps in that way, depending on the move and how long she takes to get set up for it.  Every little bit helps!

I love how this non-impact deep muscle work feels, how it stretches my back (nothing else has done this; I have had lots of lumbar issues for the last 20 years and I have 30 workout videos or more), and how relaxed and ""tall"" I feel after I'm done. Running/jogging was the only other thing I thought could help my lower body - but it was killing my knees, hips, feet, ankles... NOT WORTH IT. Not only is TBM non-impact, but it works your muscles so much better than running. And that burn... ah... it is BETTER than a ""runner's high.""

The Bar Method studio classes, I've seen online, are about $24 EACH and TBM studios have gone from three in 2003 to over a dozen five years later.  It is no wonder these DVDs are out of print; I grabbed one of each while the grabbing is good. I ran across VHS copies of the workouts in 2004, in a Ross store - they were (luckily for me) $2.99 each - right in my budget - but always wanted the DVDs.  It's nice not to have to rewind or worry that the VCR will eventually ruin the tape.

One last idea: keep track of your starting weight and inches (I take upper abs, waist, lower abs, thigh x 2, calf x 2 and upper arm x 2, both separate and then also added together), as well as a mental note of how one certain pair of just-washed jeans feels as you're putting them on - how they button up, how much room there is once you have them zipped (if you can). Then put the jeans in the laundry and wash/dry them again and hang them in the closet. After 10 workouts, try them on again... and just see how much of a change there is.  It's FUN when too-tight jeans fit better less than two weeks later, especially if you haven't cut yourself down to 900 calories a day!

Hope this helps.",1227916800,14,3404,4.312989045383412
8005298,4,B00011D172,"I've been doing these two together for 3 weeks.  The thigh work is amazing and I can already tell a difference in my butt.  However, the stomach work is iffy.  I understand it is meant to flatten the abs, but it is really hard to get the correct positioning and form if you have weak abs like me.  However, unlike traditional cruches, it doesn't kill your neck and back.
The arm workout was on the easy side. I started out using 5 lb weights (more than the instructor recommends) and my biceps are not getting much of a workout.  Good tricep work though.  I have to stop the tape and do more reps of arm work for a challenge.
I am getting a bit bored of the workout, but the results in my lower body have been significant enough that I will keep with it.  Looking forward to the new tapes this fall.",1222473600,,799,4.183006535947713
8005299,4,B00011D172,"I'm nearing 40 and bought these because I wanted (read: needed) some toning exercises.  I didn't do these very often in the beginning, maybe once or twice a week. Once I saw how these exercises were shaping up my flabby thighs and rounding and lifting my butt, I almost couldn't go one day without doing them.

The method involves doing deep muscle contractions.  You never do over 30 reps of any movement, most often it's 10 or 20 repetitions.  After working each body part you stretch before moving on.  The exercises aren't easy, at first, but they are incredibly effective.

The instruction is pleasant and I found it to be thorough.  What bothers me about both DVD's is that you can't access the menu straight away.  You are forced to sit through advertisements before starting the workout (at least my player won't let me forward through it).  I appreciate their need to promote other products, I just wish it was short and sweet.  It seems like I spend 10 minutes doing other things while I wait for the DVD to load.  As with most exercise DVD's, you will tire of the background music but there is an option to turn off the sound.

Despite my frustration with those things, I still find it very worth doing this program on an almost daily basis.  Nothing else I've tried has made me look this good in such a short amount of time.  Burr promises longer looking legs and a butt that sits higher on the hips and this program definitely delivers!",1220659200,6,1449,4.544401544401544
