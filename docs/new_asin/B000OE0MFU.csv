2794648,4,B000OE0MFU,"A real genre classic for stop motion fans...
It is hard to spot which is the special effect - the cast or the dinosaurs!
For all lovers of seventies shlock!

Loved it!",1235692800,3,167,4.21875
2794649,3,B000OE0MFU,"SORRY TO BE THE SOUR PUSS OF THE REVIEWERS BUT THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY WIDE SCREEN EDITION OF ""PLANET OF DINOSAURS"" WAS GOOD AND REAL BAD AT TIMES.
BUT I TEND TO LOOK BACK AFTER I SAW THE FILM AND HAVE FUN MEMORIES IN SPITE OF IT'S VERY LOW BUDGET MOVIE MAKING. BEING ONE OF THE LAST STOP MOTION ANIMATION B-MOVIES I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO SOMETHING A KIN TO A GOOD OLE SINBAD MOVIE. IT WAS A LOT SHORT OF THE SORT OF DINO FILMS I REMEMBER AS A KID AT THE DRIVE-IN THEATRES IN THEIR DAY. I'LL GIVE IT TO JAMES WHITWORTH THOUGH FOR SPORTING THAT PAINTED-ON BLUE AND WHITE POLYESTER SPACE SUITE WITH THE WHITE TENNIS SHOES ROVING AROUND THE DESERTED ""PLANET"". EVEN AN EARLY SCENE WHERE ONE OF THE FEMALE CO-STARS BARES DOWN TO HER BIKINI, ONLY TO JUMP IN A LAKE TO RETRIEVE SOME LOST EQUIPMENT AND GET PROMPTLY EATEN BY A DINO-FISH OF SOME SORT (BLOOD IN WATER TO BOOT). ALL IN ALL THOUGH I FOUND MYSELF FORCING THIS ONE DOWN LIKE A BAD NOVEL, JUST HOPING IT WOULD END RATHER THAN JUST HAVING FUN WITH THE FILM AND ENJOYING MYSELF. I GIVE THIS NOT SO OLD DINO FILM A C+ FOR AT LEAST KEEPING ME IN THE GAME TILL THE END..KIND OF...(THIS IS A GOOD DVD FOR ANYONE'S OLDER MOVIE SCI-FI COLLECTION..BUT ONLY IF YOU LIKE VERY B-MOVIES)",1229299200,,1224,4.235042735042735

I RECONMEND BUYING IT",1227571200,,83,4.533333333333333
2794651,3,B000OE0MFU,"Filmed as the '70s drew to a close, ""Planet of Dinosaurs"" represents one of the last examples of the skillful use dinosaur stop-motion animation before computer animation began to dominate the scene.  For fans of the art, this is a worthwhile entry.  Granted, the acting by the humans involved is pathetic.  So just ignore it and enjoy what the special effects artists on this film identify in the commentary as a tribute to Ray Harryhausen.  And a worthy effort it is!",1207526400,4,469,4.753086419753086
2794652,4,B000OE0MFU,"Another movie short on budget, but great on thrills, Planet of Dinosaurs gets an official release. It is waaaaaay better than Goodtimes.
The story is simple. Astronauts land on a well, you guessed it a Planet of Dinosaurs. Tons of dinosaurs,big and small, with a spider thrown in as well. Some minor gore.
The print is widescreen, and was taken from both 35MM and 16MM film sources, which you will notice..
Recommended to fans of low budget B movies, Dinosaur movie lovers..the dino EFX are pretty damn good all things considered
Better than that other goofy dinosaur movie Dinosaurus...
The cover states that this is the 20th Anniversary edition, but it is the 30th Anniversary edition. After emailing Retromedia, Fred Olen Ray says they're not going to fix the cover...shame on you Fred
Overall Retromedia did a good job with this movie print - but the cover mistake is huge.",1193184000,6,877,4.8533333333333335
2794653,1,B000OE0MFU,"I've loved this film ever since I was a kid and, after some good press, was really looking forward to this DVD.  Retromedia drops the ball again, however, in providing an artifacty interlaced transfer crudely blown up to fit the extra resolution of a 16:9 enhanced frame.

Even worse, new digital special effects have been added in at random and for no discernible purpose.  The audio commentary is a wonderful asset, but it isn't worth paying $13 - stick to the old Goodtimes DVD.  It was sub-par, sure, but at least it kept the film intact.",1191024000,20,542,4.614583333333333

8184778,5,B000OE0MFU,"It's a good thing the special effects are so good, as the acting leaves much to be dsired. That being said, this is one of the last stop motion Dino products to be made, and as such deserves to be rescued from destruction. The DVD copy tells you that a portion of the film was restored from a personal copy of 16mm film. Get yours today!",1470700800,2,337,4.121212121212121

8184780,3,B000OE0MFU,"If you like ""Planet of Dinosaurs"", great!  But this set also has the ultra-rare silent ""Ghost of Slumber Mountain"" by Willis  (King Kong) O'Brien. The film is not in the greatest shape  (be forewarned)  but is still worth watching.",1442275200,,231,4.846153846153846

8184782,2,B000OE0MFU,"Ha ha. The year is AD 3045 or something. A bunch of unrealistic astronauts crash on a distant planet, which is millions of years behind ours in its evolution. If you can cut through the hippie love summer stuff and the pseudo-philosophy, you might actually be able to see a couple of dinos, too. Somewhere.",1376784000,2,306,4.581818181818182
8184783,3,B000OE0MFU,"This movie is so bad it's good. GREAT dinosaur special effects from Rockne S. O'Bannon. However, the ""acting"" is hilarious on so many levels. The real hoot is the constant reappearance of Pam Bottaro's (Nyla) mustache. I guess she has a 5 o'clock shadow! Anyway, it's good for relieving the boredom on a rainy Saturday afternoon. There's NO lewd language or nudity either so the kids can watch.",1372896000,2,394,4.8088235294117645
8184784,3,B000OE0MFU,"PLANET OF DINOSAURS is about a team of male and female astronauts who crash-land on the planet of the title. All of the males are uber-macho, moustache-sporting he-men, while the females are sizzling-hot, hippie-chick types. Sometimes, bad acting is an insurmountable distraction to a movie's believability. However, in this film, the acting is so dreadfully ridiculous, that it actually adds to the overall, euphoric, brain-numbing effects of the cheeeze. The idiot dialog matches the robotic performances so completely, that it's easiest to just see the characters as androids. Of course, most people are watching this for the stop-motion dinosaurs. They are fairly well-realized. Unfortunately, their role is minimal when compared to the synthetic humanoids' scene-hogging antics! Most of the film's running time is taken up w/ mindless bickering between crewmembers, whining incessantly about their various duties and responsibilities. Thankfully, the most annoying among them is impaled on a dino-horn, in one awesome scene! Anyway, the scenery is nice, the soundtrack is groovy, and the babes are bodacious. How can you lose?...",1366502400,3,1134,5.637426900584796
8184785,4,B000OE0MFU,"This movie is SO 197os, from the costumes to the dialog. But it's still a lot of fun for those of us who remember Friday night monster and/or sic-fi films on TV - or the drive in. The stop-motion dinosaurs aren't bad. Not up to Harryhausen standards, but definitely better than many other of the gender. I'm glad I added this to my collection. If you don't mind 70s campiness, you may very well enjoy it, too.",1303862400,,409,4.324675324675325
8184786,3,B000OE0MFU,I bought it to see a girl friend who acted in the movie.  Unfortunately she broke it off before delivery.,1275696000,,105,4.25
