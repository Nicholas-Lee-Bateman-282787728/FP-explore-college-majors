8292332,5,B001D7WF8Y,I saw an episode of this when I was over in Ireland and had to own it.  This is a great series.  Very funny and I would highly recommend it.,1285632000,,140,3.6333333333333333
8292333,5,B001D7WF8Y,"Inspired lunacy in the best tradition of brilliantly skewed Irish humor. A must-see for anyone who appreciates the finer points of subversive comedy. For devotees of League of Gentlemen, Little Britain and My Hero. The only problem? This is the ONE available season in the USA. Not good. When I conducted a search to obtain the rest of the series, I was seriously disappointed to discover this glitch. So, too, is the case with My Hero. I want my perverse British/Irish comedy...and I want it now.",1264809600,2,497,4.790697674418604
8292334,4,B001D7WF8Y,"Probably will be compared with Father Ted, but much more ""Irish"" humour in it. Nice characters and some nice situations, true to life of small village ireland.",1230854400,4,159,4.925925925925926
