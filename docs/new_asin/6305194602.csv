1175070,5,6305194602,I work at a library and have had the opportunity to try many different yoga tapes.  This was by far the best that I've found!  Wai Lana is an excellent teacher and this video got me to look forward to doing yoga every day.  It is a gentle 30-minute workout followed by a 5-minute meditation.  It has been a great way for me to relieve stress!  I always feel more relaxed and invigorated after I do it.  We have even started a lunch time yoga group at work and use this tape instead of a live teacher.  I would highly recommend this tape for beginners like myself!!,980985600,35,564,4.214953271028038

1175073,5,6305194602,"I have very tight muscles due to stress, anxiety, and lower back pain. I have had to udergo deep muscle massage with a Naturalpathic physician twice a week to be able to continue my career as a nurse and be able to get out of bed in the morning. I have tention headaches and my neck muscles are like knotted ropes.

I discovered Wai Lani through my local library DVD selection. The colorful outfit she wore and the beautiful background made me check it out. It was her beginner workout.

I have tried other Yoga and I liked it, but the poses seemed to make me more tense and I was unable to relax. I immediately began to relax with the easy and slow stretches and the music was so freeing for my inner spirit. I made it through all of the routines without feeling worse than when I started the DVD.

I went to the library and checked out Wai Lani's ""Toning"" workout and the ""Relaxation"" workout. These three are my favorite. I'm not strong enough yet to work out to the ""Goodbye Inertia"" or the ""Invigorating"" workouts. Those two are too advanced for my lower back at this.

I'd love to be able to do these everyday. I'm good to do them every other day/night. Wai Lani's instruction is so thorough and soothing. I believe the scenery shots are different locations in California. I wish I could afford to live there!

I'm a Wai Lani fan now!",1324252800,,1340,4.365461847389558
1175074,5,6305194602,"This is a great DVD, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a beginners workout. It seems more of an advanced beginner to immediate level. Nonetheless, it's a WONDERFUL relaxing yoga video! I love the background, music, and cueing! Even though the asanas are challenging, she tells you how to modify and to do your best! I just wish she tells you which pose you are doing when she does it. Beginners need to know which pose is what at the time it's demonstrated. You are able to go to extras to find out the different asanas but still, it would make it more convenient, if it's said at the time it's demonstrated.

1175075,3,6305194602,"I usually love Wai Lana Yoga videos. This is good, but I think it shouldn't have been labeled for beginners. Since I'm definitely a beginner I was attracted to this title, but I found it more difficult than the ones I've tried and really liked: ""relaxation workout"" and ""goodbye inertia"". Those are great and don't offer the kind of difficult poses found here. Don't get me wrong, it's good and I'm working with it, but I wouldn't make it my first one: I'd make it my second or third, after I had a little more experience.  In general Wai Lana videos are very good: focused, practical,  with a  relaxing and educational attitude and gentle, appealing settings.",1295740800,8,660,4.672413793103448

After going through this video about 4 days in a row, my back and thigh muscles had loosened up enough that I no longer needed pain killers.  It saved a lot of money when the chiropractor wasn't able to help.  Now, when I get tension anywhere in my neck or torso I use this video.  It has helped!",1261267200,2,369,4.083333333333333

After recieving Wai Lana's Yoga set as a gift several years ago with her Toning video, I was totally hooked. She has all but cured my asthma... Anyhoo, after recieving this video I popped it in and was astounded. Not having much time before I had to step out, I did the first two of the excersises and was amazed even more. She opened up my rib cage, my chest, shoulders, lungs, traps, etc. all with only two simple standing moves. I will always be grateful to her. I recommend her videos to every one, especially those with asthma -- I know first hand.  Try her excersises. Her voice in gentle, the locations are beautiful and will always put you in the move to workout the moment you press play. Her instructions are wonderful. And the music is always peaceful. Please, listen to her advice and utilize it. You will have a much safer and productive workout. I will definately use this video as my cool down session after completing my more strenuous workout sets.. Enjoy.",1259366400,,1046,4.505263157894737
1175078,3,6305194602,"But Wai Lana's dvds are so relaxing, I use them for napping.  She creates the atmosphere wonderfully (music, scenerey, tone of voice) and you won't feel like you are physically exerting yourself.",1231718400,,195,5.09375

Finally, no sun salutation! A refreshing change. You wonder of other yoga traditions know any thing else to start a beginner?

 My only reason for not giving 5 stars is that there is no short version on the dvd. It doesn't even say how long the work out is...seems like way over an hour?? I would have liked a short 30 min workout included for busy days and a separate meditation section. It seems to just go on forever...",1202774400,,575,4.364485981308412
1175080,4,6305194602,"The poses and stretches in this video are great for someone who is just starting out. The instructor does a good job of displaying the poses and she gives alternate poses for people who might have difficulty with some aspect of a certain pose. The music is also very nice. The only gripes I have are really just a matter preference. Her accent is quite noticeable, and although it is not difficult to understand what she is saying, it is distracting to me at times. Also, her outfit changes about every 8 or nine minutes and that is a little distracting too.
I would definitely recommend it though, especially since the price is manageable.",1185062400,2,640,4.62280701754386
1175081,5,6305194602,I used to watch Wai Lana's T.V. show on my local channel and I loved her 30 min. programme.  After the station shut down I decided to purchase her beginners dvd.  I was not disappointed.  This dvd was easy to follow and it keeps me motivated and interested.  I had stopped exercising for several years and so was very surprised when some of the poses were a challenge.  I'm going to purchase more of her dvds as my flexibility and strength increase.,1177200000,2,449,4.426829268292683
1175082,5,6305194602,"Wai Lana may take some getting used to, but once you have done this routine a couple of times you won't be able to give it up.  The feeling you have afterwards is more ""invigorated"" than ""relaxed"" which is terrific.  The combination of poses is excellent, by the time you are done you will feel very open and loose.  As others have said, her voice is very calming and the music is nice, the scenery is beautiful.  It has to be said.....you should watch this for her outfits alone.  It works because her yoga is so good...she truly has her own style.",1171411200,3,549,4.3431372549019605
1175083,4,6305194602,"Wai Lana's Yoga: Beginner's Workout, much like her Relaxation Workout, is very calming; however, some of the stretches and asanas that require balancing on one leg may be difficult for some beginners (like me). All-in-all, though, I enjoy the workout!",1167782400,4,251,5.3
1175084,4,6305194602,"This dvd is mostly just stretching but its very relaxing.  Her voice is calming and gentle but a little strange, takes some getting use to.  It kinda freaks me out for the first few minutes every time I put it in!  This is the dvd I like to use before I go to my yoga class for some reason.  I guess because of all the stretching it really loosens ya up. She uses different poses than most other dvds which is nice for a change. A great one to have in your library. Beautiful scenery also.",1159660800,2,489,4.0625
1175085,5,6305194602,"Wai Lana's yoga Beginners Workout is the perfect balance of challenge, toning, and relaxation.  Her accent and colorful clothing took a bit of getting used to, but now I love it.  Her voice is soothing, and her instruction is helpful without being intrusive.  In addition, the scenery is so beautiful and really adds to the relaxing mood of the practice.

While it is very appropriate for beginners, you can make it more challenging by deepening the stretches.  Wai Lana never pushes you to do more than what is comfortable, but she is very encouraging.

While so many of the newer yoga dvds seem more like aerobics, Wai Lana does yoga the way it should be.  I would recommend this dvd to anyone who loves yoga.  I look forward to trying Wai Lana's toning workout next.",1122076800,14,769,4.644444444444445
1175086,5,6305194602,"Great beginner workout.  Scenery is beautiful and soothing, as is Wai Lana's voice.  So effective I bought her kid's workout dvd for my little boy.  He demands to do yoga every morning.

Other workouts have actually made me a little tense with too much talking or monotonous background scenery and music.

1175087,5,6305194602,"Got it today, did it today! Wai Lana doesn't dress like the other video yoginis and the video covers are colored somewhat like kid videos so I bypassed her for WAY too long.  She doesn't demonstrate modifications but even without prior yoga experience her instructions and encouragement to do the best you can are enough, imo.  This video starts off with the shoulders which is wonderfully different, especially since mine are extremely tight and the beginning postures completely release them and the upper back.  The asanas have different names than you're probably used to but the pacing is perfect so there's absolutely no stress or straining.  I don't think you can call this gentle yoga because you will be doing much more than mild stretches with Wai Lana but the music, scenery and her voice overs make it so accessible that it's quite relaxing. Okay, I thought, so she leads a thorough session, how's she going to do with the relaxation at the end?  Fortunately, it was wonderful (woo-woo free) and if you peek you'll see tranquil and uplifting scenes of happy people, wildlife and water.  All the visuals are superb throughout and now I'm thinking the other yoginis have been shortchanging me! If you're want something slower and with little heat, Wai Lana may be what you're looking for.",1113436800,37,1298,4.877272727272727
1175088,5,6305194602,"I've been doing yoga over 3 years starting with Rodney Yee who helped to get yoga more mainstream years ago with Oprah. I started with him & tried at least 20 others, but only liked Rodney Yee & Rainbeau Mars the most. With their help, I went from unable to each touch my feet to doing full splits by only doing 20-30 min a day 1-3x/week.

In the extras menu option, there is a guidelines option to get more detailed infomation about each asana, with her demonstrating, how to do it & what to watch out for to avoid injury. Also you can Customize your workout by deciding how many & which asnanas to do for your workout.

Grass Tiger wrote the asanaa in the 3 DVD Easy Series which this dvd is part of:  Blowing tree, Hummingbird, Folding Triangle, Wraparound Twist, Diving Pose, Krishna Pose, Churning Butter, Easy Arrow, Boomerang, Easy Wheel, Easy Spinal Twist, Easy Bow, Mini Sit-up, Head Roll, Cannonball, Yoga Nidra, and Meditation.

I wish I known about Wai Lana earlier. Her beginning DVDs are not easy for those who are very out of shape, but she gives modifications. She's one of the only ones who tells you the benefits & what conditions it helps you treat as you do the poses to keep you inspired. I wish more of them did that to keep you going & not be bored & reminded why you're doing it. When this workout was done, I was actually upset it was over rather then relieved like I normally am with most yoga workouts. After each pose/exercise, I really felt the stretch & the energy/blood circulation after, I always feel lighter & more graceful & more aware. She also does poses that most don't do that really feel awesome. Some may be considered Kundalini yoga style such as shoulder rolls, leg lifts in some of Wai Lana's workouts, but they really help you stretch more. Any moving exercises are done slow so you feel the joints losening up. Most yoga DVDs I've gotten have been the same exact poses in almost the same sequence (so many sun salutations!), but she's totally different. I loved her relaxation workout, my back feels much straighter then it has in years. I can't wait to get her toning workout of her easy series.
2007: I own ALL her videos now & love them all. I believe her asanas really are authentic & have Qi Gong/Chi Kung martial art healing exercises in them that really build up your energy deeply.

There are great pictures of her in poses on her site wailana com",1110240000,57,2401,4.472602739726027
1175089,5,6305194602,"Hi. This is a great DVD for someone just starting yoga and/or getting into fitness.  It's mostly stretching which is a great starting point. Once you have done this DVD and feel ready for the next level, try one of her more intense DVDs which you can see on her Web site. Google search ""Wai Lana"" for her site. To start using a balance ball, look at Gaiam's ""BalanceBall Beginners Workout"" DVD.  If you are looking to purchase a ball see if you can find Gaiam's that comes with a free DVD balance ball sampler. Great starter!  Also, this DVD is great to get your blood moving and get the sleep out of your body without making you all sweaty before you would need to go to work.  You can also use it as a relaxing yoga DVD before bed as it does get the blood moving to your joints, but does not really elevate your heart beat.  Lastly, make sure you have a yoga mat for any yoga and/or balance ball workouts.  Carpet is nice, but hard on the spine and knees.  You can get a cheap one at Wal-Mart or Target, but if you perspire a lot you may want to invest in one a little better that can be machine washed.  Have fun!",1104969600,15,1116,4.1342592592592595
1175090,4,6305194602,"This DVD is great for those beginning yoga or those getting back into it. I was on a one year pause from yoga (slipped disk) and I am now back into it. Wai Lana has a very soothing voice, explaines breathing technique while doing the work out, also clearly explains the positions. The scenery is stunning...Hawaii i think?? I'd like to know where she is! I have been doing it for a couple of weeks now on a regular basis and my spine feels great, flexible and stronger. I highly recommend it. The end part where she's jumping off the sand banks is a little corney...but just close your eyes at that part and relax to the soothing sounds....enjoy!",1104278400,5,646,4.436974789915967
1175091,3,6305194602,"I bought this set as a gift, but ended up keeping it and using it myself. For an entire winter, I got up and did one of the 3 tapes every morning. It definitely produced good physical and mental results, but I got burned out on Wai Lana. She is kind of a kooky character, and I found myself reluctant to do the tapes and listen to her odd, almost bizarrely-sedate sounding voice. Keep in mind that you may want to rotate this set with another teacher's.",1102809600,,453,4.218390804597701
1175092,5,6305194602,"I really love this DVD. OK, I have done a little yoga here and there over the years but I always kept it simple and easy, just enough to feel stretched out in the morning, but Wai Lana's beginning DVD has been such a welcome addition to my life. I've already ordered the toning work out and I cant wait for it to come. Wai Lana's instructions are easy to follow and she is very thorough about guiding you with breathing and making you feel ok if your range of movement is not that of a master. I feel totally comfortable. The postures she has chosen are wonderful and have a way of working deeply on all levels, mental , spiritual, and physical. Yet there is no spiritual philosophy pushed. You get the feeling you are learning from someone who is living it, not preaching it. The scenery is beautiful, from Hawaii and Sedona and some other beautiful locations. The photography is beautiful and careful to show the postures in a way that you can easily see how to do them. She has a gentle, soothing voice, and she is dressed beautifully for each scene. I think there are more costume changes than a Stevie Nicks concert! You may wonder why her clothing is important, but it really makes a difference. She wears all these beautiful flowing colors and I really think they have a positive healing effect. She also wears pretty leis (sp?) and flowers in her hair. It really makes for a very nice workout and she has picked some of the most beautiful places in nature to teach her yoga method. Even though this is a beginners DVD, there is alot of room to grow into it and to get better and better at the postures. I am totally pleased with this DVD and am looking forward to trying the others in her beginners series.",1101686400,14,1714,4.3930817610062896
1175093,5,6305194602,"I am new to yoga and knew nothing when I picked Wai Lana's Beginners Workout. To my delight, this DVD provided both encouragement for the beginner and challenges to look forward to. As each week goes by, i can see improvement and am now trying some of the asanas that were too difficult for me to attempt. The ""design your own work feature"" allows me to customize my work outs just how I want them.

My sister,who has been doing Yoga for about 30 years, says that ""This is how Yoga is suppose to be!""",1092873600,10,500,4.2631578947368425
1175094,5,6305194602,"I found this easy series just right for me as a beginner and this ""Beginners Workout"" DVD is my favorite in the series. I have had to do some for less time than shown and have over the last couple months strengthened incredibly. This is really the only exercise I do and my muscles are firm and movement is coming much easier for me. When finished I feel like I've had a full body workout. It is refreshing and energizing.
Wai Lana has a soothing voice that my husband calls monotone, but I find is slightly melodious and very easy to ignore when I'm doing something else, but easy to hear and calming to listen to when I do. She moves between poses rather quickly, but after a while I got used to this. If this is bothersome to you at first you can do the ""One Asana at a time"" or just do the poses in less time to give you time to rest more between poses. Wai Lana has beautiful outfits that change throughout each session and a variety of beautiful backgrounds. Her outfits are very modest and not form fitting (a plus for men who don't want distraction). She wears an elastic belt around her waist, which helps you see what she is doing with her waist. She is very descriptive of how to do the poses and what benefits you are getting. Because her voice is non-intrusive it isn't irritating that she talks most of the time. She says nothing extraneous that would distract you from the pose and over a long period of time of using the DVD hearing her say the same things each time also doesn't get irritating.
On the main menu you have ""Start Workout"", ""Extras"", and Introduction (which is the same on each DVD). The ""Start Workout"" is the entire work out for that DVD. The workout itself consists of about 35 minutes of asanas. After that is a time of music and meditation. Under ""Extras"" it lists ""One Asana at a time"", which does as it says; ""Customize your workout"", this lets you do the asanas (poses) in any order you wish with 17 asanas and 20 slots for your choices, so you can do one more than once or some not at all as you don't have to fill all the slots; ""Guidelines"" this is a basic rundown of things to do and not to do to get the most out of it and prevent injury; ""Wai Lana's Little Yogi's"", this includes some snippets advertising her children's DVD; and ""More from Wai Lana"", which covers all the things she has to sell - her other DVDs and tapes, her music CDs, mats, etc. You can also see those things on her website: [...]
The DVD comes with an illustrated book showing a picture of each asana, its English name, and what it physically benefits most. This is useful if you are going traveling and don't have a DVD player, doing the set outside, or if you want to do the set at your own pace.
There is also an option on the main screen of each that allows you to change from English to Spanish.
This Beginner's DVD includes these asanas: Blowing tree, Hummingbird, Folding Triangle, Wraparound Twist, Diving Pose, Krishna Pose, Churning Butter, Easy Arrow, Boomerang, Easy Wheel, Easy Spinal Twist, Easy Bow, Mini Sit-up, Head Roll, Cannonball, Yoga Nidra, and Meditation.
Side note: the asana Wai Lana is doing on the front of each DVD cover is not included on that DVD, so don't pick the DVD(s) you buy by the asana pictured on the front.",1085097600,111,3263,4.359605911330049
1175095,5,6305194602,"Being a very macho type of guy, I've always thought yoga was for sissies. That is until one night my girlfriend coaxed me into trying Wai Lana's Easy Beginners Workout Video. She told me it would help me with my workout regiment (I workout with heavy weights at the gym 5 nights a week). After trying it just once, my attitude changed completely.
I've briefly watched yoga classes at my gym and even watched a bit of yoga instruction on TV, which did nothing to attract me to yoga. But Wai Lana, WOW! Her soothing voice, the way she makes it so easy and enjoyable, the scenery, the vivid colors, and the beautiful locations...
This video can calm the wildest of beasts; I'm living proof. I now look forward to it every day and find that I'm working muscles that were otherwise neglected with my usual weight training. I now have great stamina and feel a sense of calm I've never had before.
I'm a believer!

Wai has such a soothing voice and the DVD has beautiful backgrounds, images, and music. The work-out closes with a meditation with lovely music and images. It is a very relaxing close to the sessions and will leave you feeling very refreshed. The DVD is around 50 minutes long with a nice introduction and you can also go to each exercise in the DVD by using the chapter menu or you can even set up the exercises in the order YOU want to go in. I would say this DVD is perfect for not only beginners at Yoga but those who practice Yoga already but do not want too ""heavy"" of a work-out.

Wai Lana's Beginner's Workout makes it easy, because I can pop in the tape and do only as many of the asanas as I have time for.  I have tried different aerobics and workout tapes, and the routines are very awkward to start and stop in the middle - plus your body doesn't get the full benefit of the workout.  With the Beginner's Workout, all the asanas work out and stretch the whole body, so you know you're getting a full workout even if you can only do a few of the asanas.  Also, my kids love to do the workouts with me, so I don't have to worry about what they're getting into while I'm exercising!",1072656000,5,684,4.120300751879699
1175098,5,6305194602,"I'm new to yoga, but a friend introduced me to this tape, and now I'm hooked! I thought yoga was just about trying to twist your body into a pretzel and then zone out. I had no idea what a workout it is. I can't figure out how it energizes AND relaxes me so much at the same time - but I love it!
Wai Lana is a terrific teacher. She's warm, always encouraging, never pushy - and never made me feel like I was just a dumb beginner. Even though a couple of the postures were a real stretch, I just did what I could and that was great. And on the last posture, the Yoga Nidra relaxation, I just melted into the floor.
The tape is beautiful to look at, with amazing tropical scenery, and the music was a pleasant surprise - not your dreaded New Age stuff, but full-bodied, upbeat and mellow.
With yoga, it hardly looks like you're doing anything - but at the end, you know you've done some aerobics. I call it the ""stealth workout"" - and ""stealth"" rhymes with ""health"". It's certainly doing wonders for mine! This tape is terrific.
