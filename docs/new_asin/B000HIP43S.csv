8139964,5,B000HIP43S,"Kagome is a normal high school girl, until she falls down a well at her home on her 15th birthday. She climbs out and finds herself in a 16th century Japan where demons run rampant. She is pursued by a centipede demon and finds herself clinging to a boy stuck to a tree. He wakes up and tells her if she removes him from the tree, he will kill the monster. He makes good on the promise. While the fight goes on a jewel comes out of Kagome's side. It has the power to make any demon or human immeasurably powerful. That makes it a hot commodity. While retrieving the jewel, Kagome breaks it, and the shards are scattered throughout the country. Inuyasha and Kagome must work together to find them all and keep them out of the hands of evil doers.

The demon horse, Entei, and Hakudoshi are now traveling all over killing scores of demons. Their goal is to open the path between the land of the dead and our world. The last jewel shard is believed to be hidden there. Meanwhile Inuyasha's group encounters an child otter demon, who's father was killed by Hakudoshi. They decide to help him search for his father's head. Even if they find it, there is only one person that can resurrect the boy's fther. Sesshomaru is their only hope. Afterwards, our heroes seek out the magic jewel maker, in an attempt to find a way to beat Naraku to the land of the dead.

This anime is a legend. If there is someone out there who hasn't seen it, they need to remedy that situation as soon as possible. This series has everything. Drama, action, comedy, suspense, and romance. It is a fairy tale that you will never forget. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are also unforgettable. This anime is one of the best ever, and a must see for anime fans of all ages.",1353456000,,1753,4.390769230769231
8139965,5,B000HIP43S,"You would think that Hakudoshi, the pint-sized infant incarnation of Naraku would be dead after being split in half by a powerful priest, but that's not the case. Instead, he is able to transform into a pint-sized walking killing machine that doesn't need Kagura to carry him around! He even finds a new steed after quickly dispatching the fiery demon horse Entei's original master. He's also no longer interested in murdering priests to get a glimpse of the nether region where the last jewel shard lies. He needs something more powerful, so he begins to hunt down powerful demons instead, all the while playing a cat and mouse game with Inuyasha and friends, who are unknowingly being manipulated into aiding his cause.

Overall, this was an above average volume of Inuyasha. The fact that Hakudoshi is a little kid and yet is still so evil makes his character twice as intense and disturbing. My favorite episode on the disk had to be the one where Shippo steps up to the plate to help a young otter demon, who much like himself, is in danger of losing his father. Sesshomaru also has a nice little cameo in that episode. It really nails home the point that all the characters in the show are vibrant, living beings that show their true selves at different points during the show. You also feel the love all the cast has for each other. Even a character like Sesshomaru shows a little heart sometimes. Great series.",1165190400,,1418,4.672
