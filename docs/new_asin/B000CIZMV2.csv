2465416,4,B000CIZMV2,"I just was looking for some Pilates DVD's to give me new ideas on how to teach my Pilates class. In general,I do like Winsor Pilates DVD series.",1325289600,,144,4.178571428571429
2465417,5,B000CIZMV2,"This is another one of Mari Winsor's fantastic 20 minute workouts.  I love it because in 20 min, i feel i've had a pretty good workout even if i can't do anything more in that day.  It's great stretching, great for the posture and good particularly for core and legs...it's challenging but do-able.  i am not a workout fiend but find that i don't feel that great if i don't do at least some pilates each day.",1296345600,2,408,4.2727272727272725
2465418,5,B000CIZMV2,this is an awesome work out! I love it! If you master the 20min. video this is the next step! If you eat right and do this regularly you really should get results! Cardio alongside this is a big boost to results too!,1257033600,5,216,4.046511627906977
2465419,5,B000CIZMV2,"if you want a quick pilates workout, this is the dvd for you.  it is moves along, is concise and clear.",1256256000,3,103,3.9047619047619047
2465420,5,B000CIZMV2,I have Mari's original dvds and got this one and the ball workout for xmas.  I love this!!  It is an intense core workout.  Note:  you must be familiar with her original workouts first.  I do them on a regular basis and had trouble keeping up the first time.,1199577600,3,258,4.183673469387755
2465421,4,B000CIZMV2,"This 19-minute Pilates routine ups the intensity by moving more quickly than most. Instructor Mari Winsor starts with the traditional sequence of the hundred-the rollup-the rollover, moving briskly through the repetitions and with little pausing between the exercises. After rolling like a ball and single leg circles, Mari leads you right into the series of five, increasing the intensity by adding a second set of faster repetitions to each move. Other exercises included in this workout are leg kicks, back stretch, child's pose, the neck pull, the jackknife, swimming, several teaser variations, heel beats, and some of the side kick series. You'll end with a few additional side kick exercises performed on the knees (tough!) and finally the seal. I use this video frequently whenever I am looking for a quick, intense Pilates workout at an intermediate level.",1162771200,40,865,5.27536231884058

2465424,5,B000CIZMV2,"If you are a fan of Winsor pilates, this video is for you!  It is a fast pace version of her other videos, that gives you an awesome workout it just 20 minutes.  I like to incorporate this with her other 3 20min videos.  If you have never done pilates before, this may be to fast paced for you, and she gives very little instructions on how to perform the excercises.  I would definitely recommend!",1153094400,9,398,4.266666666666667
2465425,5,B000CIZMV2,Love WInsor Pilates. I received this in a very short period of time!,1438646400,,68,4.3076923076923075
2465426,4,B000CIZMV2,Good workout but too short,1435968000,,26,4.4
2465427,5,B000CIZMV2,Advanced means advanced.  As a beginner it took me a while to get up to speed with this workout.  Great Price and fast delivery.,1433635200,2,128,4.291666666666667

2465430,3,B000CIZMV2,"I've loved every other Mari Windsor Pilates video that I've done--she's pleasant and the moves are not difficult but they really work at toning my muscles and it's pretty relaxing even though it's a tough workout.  I didn't love this one as much because of the fast pace.  This video moves very quickly so you need to be familiar with Mari's routines to keep up.  Also, if anything hurts (back, neck, etc.), I would not recommend this video because of the fast pace.",1426032000,,466,4.590361445783133
2465431,5,B000CIZMV2,"my favorite workout, strengthens core, doesn't take to much time, helps my back tremendously...use it along with a mini trampoline for back problems!!!",1424476800,,151,5.608695652173913
2465432,5,B000CIZMV2,"I have 20 minutes pilates, recently ordered upper body sculpt.  And I do like both, and today I received this body slimming advanced and tried this morning.  It is a combination of both 20 minutes pilates and upper body sculpt (just a portion of it) and much faster tempo with a few completely new movement that are challenging.  I love it.  Yes, I sweat it more than other ones.  But I think this is good since I feel 20 minutes pilates are too easy for me now.",1409788800,,462,4.264367816091954

2465435,5,B000CIZMV2,Love Winsor Pilates and use this dvd often to tighten and tone my body.,1404864000,,71,4.142857142857143
2465436,5,B000CIZMV2,This is a great strength workout that will give you results and you can do on those days when you just don't have time to do anything else.  It is also great for those days when you really just can't get motivated to do anything and when you finish you feel really good.  It focuses on you breathing so it is calming and effective at the same time.  There are some difficult moves but you can just do what you can until you get stronger.  I actually pair this with the Lower Body dvd when I want a nice long strength workout instead of the regular weight or bad workouts.  There is also an arms one that I am trying out and all together or individually you get a full body workout that feels really good and gives great results.,1401926400,,728,4.171428571428572
2465437,5,B000CIZMV2,"Great condition of the DVD, practically NEW! This DVD is easy to follow up and understand each posture or movement.",1390780800,,115,4.8

Not for beginners.",1381795200,,136,5.2272727272727275
2465439,5,B000CIZMV2,"I've had this Windsor DVD for nearly 10 years now, I still love it.  I had to stop my workout routine due to health issues, and I am now finally able to get back into it.

Thankfully, Mari Winsor shows how to do these workouts if you have issues with your neck and back.

  I hope to re-gain what I have lost (muscle wise) ... or and vice versa.  I'm also looking into some of her other dvds ... I enjoy her method so much.",1377388800,3,423,3.9176470588235293
2465440,5,B000CIZMV2,I needed a challenge and this workout was it! Only wish it went on for a longer workout. Sometimes I do it after doing something else by Mari as a warm up.,1372636800,,155,3.875
2465441,5,B000CIZMV2,"I have had a pilates machine and still, this DVD set is one of the most wonderful pilates exercises out there for general core build up.  I love it and ordered after having loaned mine a year ago and not getting it back.  Love Winsor Pilates programs.",1365379200,3,251,4.319148936170213
2465442,5,B000CIZMV2,"This is a great 20 minute core work out.  I use it every week and see the results - stronger core, more toned abs, better posture.  I highly recommend it and the other Winsor Pilates DVDs.",1357084800,,188,4.194444444444445
2465443,5,B000CIZMV2,"Mari Windsor gives the best pilates workouts in my opinion.  Great paced, not boring, and  her tone is not annoying-very cheerful and inspiring.  I get great results.  Been doing her videos for years!",1354060800,3,200,4.96969696969697
2465444,5,B000CIZMV2,"I LOVE this exercise video, because it it short, fast, easy, but I also feel a difference in my boy and energy level after doing it. 20 minutes a day and I feel and look great. LOVE!",1331942400,,182,3.945945945945946

8099140,5,B000CIZMV2,Have used this DVD many times and it was tome for a new one. The best 20 minute  advanced/intermediate Pilates workout. She dosen't break it dow so you need to now what you are doing...just what I wanted.,1502841600,2,204,4.368421052631579
8099141,1,B000CIZMV2,"Another useless dvd from the Winsor instructor. Its not challenging enough to change your body.
Cassey Ho pop pilates dvd is excellent! And so is weight loss pilates by Kristen M. Top dogs.",1502236800,,189,4.757575757575758
8099142,5,B000CIZMV2,I love Pliates!!!! this is so much more 'to the point' than the accelerated. i can get my workout in without all the explaining Mari does :) I already know what i'm doing so this dvd is great.,1478131200,,192,4.078947368421052
8099143,5,B000CIZMV2,"It's not a game-the exercises may look easy but they hurt like hell and you'll get your heart rate up. You don't need special equipment for this, so you can just put the DVD in and go. I'm glad I got this-especially for the price! I use it on days I am in between weight training.",1476316800,,280,4.017857142857143
8099144,5,B000CIZMV2,Thank u,1473120000,,7,3.0

8099146,2,B000CIZMV2,"Not bad, but she goes to fast. I'm already familiar with the moves cause I been doing her pilates 100 dvd that is avout 50 minutes long. This one has very similar moves but it feels like she wants to cramp allbthe moves in a 30 minute video. Is not easy on my hip, and I'm 30 years old lol. I usually use for a quick work out but i try to go easy even though I might miss some steps.",1453680000,,383,3.740740740740741
