8262435,5,B0016GOO54,"I watched Madhumati last night- not exactly sure what to expect. I'd never seen an Indian film before, and was very pleasantly surprised!  At first I had a bit of trouble following the English subtitles while at the same time following the movie.  I loved the woman who played Madhumati- she was gorgeous and danced in ways I had never seen.
This is a story about love that transcends time and space, it's about reincarnation, and ghosts too.
I won't add any spoilers, just want to say that this is a lovely film.",1308700800,,513,4.505376344086022
8262436,3,B0016GOO54,"The movie Madhumati was made for lovers everywhere. It portrayed the saying ""love never dies"" perfectly and the actors, Dilip Kumar and Vijantymala were the perfect couple in this love story. There was just the right amount of romance and tragedy shown in this movie with a very interesting twist towards the end. The songs were amazing and they fit the movie perfectly. My favourite one was ""toote hoi khabo ne."" To top it off, Johnny Walker gave a wonderful performance that added much needed comedy to this film. I cannot think of any scene that i disliked, the directors did a wonderful job making sure that the movie was always interesting.",1301875200,2,645,4.767857142857143
8262437,5,B0016GOO54,"One of the best movies to come out of Bollywood. The songs are part of the story instead of just being breaks in the story as in other movies. The acting is good. Some subtitles are not grammatically correct, but the movie is still worth watching.",1261008000,4,247,4.391304347826087
