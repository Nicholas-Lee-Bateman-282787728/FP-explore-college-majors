This 1968 film directed by Robert Stevenson is a rousing light hearted comedy from Disney starring Peter Ustinov, Dean Jones, and Suzanne Pleshette. I love these older Disney films. This one is quite good. It is a fun movie. Dean Jones had certain easy going screen presence that just fit these Disney movies perfectly.",1421452800,,377,5.096774193548387
7912633,5,B00000JMLB,"I had watched this movie when I was 6-7 years old and I remember we all loved it at home. For the past so many years I was unable to remember the name of the movie except that it was about a dead pirate. Went on to search online and found it here! Watched the movie again with my kids. They didn't seem to like it so much, of course movie is dated and seems rather slow for a comedy. But I still loved it, laughed at the silliness of the pranks. All time classic!",1319587200,,463,3.8842105263157896
7912634,5,B00000JMLB,Just an overall family fun comedy from the 60's....  Great for adults and kids alike.  Never gets old.  Great Seller.,1289865600,,117,4.75
7912635,5,B00000JMLB,I love this movie and I wanted to order it.  After reading the reviews about the DVD version I decided to just order the VHS.,1184889600,,125,4.0
7912636,1,B00000JMLB,"This is my all time favorite Disney movie, but I have reason to hate it now. Where is the widescreen version?
When will Disney quit pandering to those unknowing consumers who sacrifice the full movie for ""Full Screen"" format. I'll bet they think that they actually get more picture since there are no 'black bars"" on the top and bottom of the screen. If they only knew that the edges are chopped off to make it fit...or worse, the picture is squeezed out of proportion.
I personally don't enjoy two noses talking to each other. Give me the FULL movie! Give us WIDESCREEN options!
C'mon Disney, show some class.",1023235200,9,610,4.605504587155964
7912637,5,B00000JMLB,"I remember back in 1988 when my father bought our very first VCR, back then they where ridiculously expensive. But, I also remember that the very first movie I saw on that thing was Disney's ""Blackbeard's Ghost"". It was so funny and smart. I would watch it over and over again. A must for any family to watch together.",999043200,2,318,4.406779661016949
7912638,5,B00000JMLB,"A very funny movie. I am not a big fan of old movies, but this one is awesome. Lots of fun. A definate must see if you like Classic Walt Disney",961459200,12,143,3.6451612903225805
