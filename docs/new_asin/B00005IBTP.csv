7938242,5,B00005IBTP,"I had the opportunity to view 2 out of 3 parts of Entre Terre et Mer during a recent sojourn in Brittany. It is a very well acted drama, based in solid historic research, and filmed on location near St. Malo. I am disappointed that it is not available in a subtitled DVD format accessible to US audiences. Brittany is a popular travel destination, and this film offers wonderful insights into the region's 20th century history.",1196726400,,427,4.631578947368421
