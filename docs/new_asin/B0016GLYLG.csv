8262461,5,B0016GLYLG,"I am not even sure what bands are on Earache's roster these days, but I sure as hell knew the score during the classic period represented by the first three-fourths of this DVD. Essential videos--including some that were even played on MTV's `Headbanger's Ball' back in the day--from Entombed, At The Gates, Iron Monkey, Sleep, Pitchshifter, Dub War, Brutal Truth, Godflesh, Napalm Death, Cathedral, Carcass, and more, plus live clips, band discographies, and some other cool bonus features. This isn't a double-sided DVD/CD hybrid like the original release, but it's still a fundamental lesson in grind.",1293926400,3,604,5.302083333333333
