4092907,4,B00393SFTS,"after reviewing this film i rated it a 4 star production. the ators in the film did a good role portrayal of their characters. the story line was a well narrated folk-llore tale. the action was great and the locations were well chosen. one of the characters in the film i had seen before in a film production by tony jaa. he fit the role very wll. i appreciate the actors in this film because the elders had much more acting experience and portayed their character role well. the screen play was well written and the audio production and music was great. the lead female role was great, i applasud the spirit of her character...she fiesty, strong willed and proved her character as a leader who believed in her leadership abilities to over come the enemy and not surrender to their demans. the costumes were well designed and quite appropiate for the action scenes in the production. will look for more pmovie production from this production team of writers, actor, directors, and writers.

thanks for the adventure.",1289606400,10,1016,4.740112994350283
4092908,5,B00393SFTS,"My wife and I enjoyed it. It was a kick in the pants since it was nice break from typical chop suey flicks
It was nice to get something different that was entertaining.
Glad we added it to our collection.",1282953600,2,204,4.125
4092909,3,B00393SFTS,"Legend of the tsunami warrior seems to mix in a little bit of everything. Pirates,Ninjas,Martial Arts,Aqua Man, romance, drama, etc...etc... it's all here. For what the film is it's pretty entertaining. I can't say anything truly bad about it. It has a lot of action and special effects, and the acting is on par with the typical acting you'd expect from an action movie like this. The films is also lengthy about 2hrs or so but it actually feels longer since there is so much happening. Matter of fact I think that's the only part about this movie where anything can be taken away from it. There is just too much going on in the movie.

There's about 5 different plots and sub plots all happening on film at once. Trying to follow the main story is a bit hard because you can't figure out just what is the main story. Is it about Wizards? Is it about revenge? Is it about romance? just what is this film about. I'm still asking myself haven seen it and I still don't have the answer. My advice to anyone watching the movie is to pick a character and follow their story. It's almost like a Choose your adventure story. You can pick The body guard,the Queen, The Princess, The Canon Engineer, The young Wizard,The Old Wizard, The Pirate king, I mean just pick one. All of their stories get about equal play time in this movie (I picked the Queen I liked her outfit).

Basically to anyone interested in this movie the first thing you need to know is that it's subtitled, and that it was made in Thailand and has a heavy influence of Eastern Culture. If your not into those types of movies than right of the type you won't enjoy this film... however if you don't mind a little culture shock, than like me you will probably find the film entertaining.

There's really no comparison to this film. It just branches off into too many directions. The mains story is about a Young man who is born with the power to control the sea. He has a gift for a magic art called ""Dun Lum"" that allows him to do this. The young man grows up in a humble and peaceful village. When he is older he finds himself wanting to protect the things he loves so he joins a group of local towns people who ward off pirates. Some stuff happens and he finds himself looking after the village inventor who has many secrets that lead him to the adventure that turns him into the Tsunami Warrior.

That is the bases of the plot the rest you'll figure out on your own should you decide to watch the movie. I recommend checking the film out it's on the level of a Pirates of the Caribbean with the action sequences cinematography. The feel of the film isn't cheap but there's some effects that you have seen done better (which some reviews nag about). It you watch this expecting an entertaining action film that is what you will get because that is just what this film is. Don't try to pick it apart or try to fill in all the holes. Just enjoy the film for what it is.

I recommend renting this film to see if you like it before adding it to your collection.",1282435200,40,3020,4.328621908127208

I must say it was a bit predictable, a little hard to follow because there were so many underlying stories. I feel like the main character Pari, could of had more of a back story and just spoke more about him period. I guess the main story is not even about pari, it's about the queen vs the pirates. That whole back story was explained but I felt like their were many plot holes. But other wise minus my analytic way of thinking, it was a good watch and has a power that I haven't seen in any other movie. Also, I enjoyed the mix of different cultures.

This is the plot for those who don't know or those who would like to know
Plot[edit]

Queen Hijau (The Green Queen) of Pattani faces overthrow by the rebel Prince Rawai, who is allied with pirate captain Black Raven. The pirates attempt to capture some giant cannon invented by Dutchman Janis Bree and Chinese inventor Lim Kiam, but the Dutch ship carrying the cannon blows up and the cannons sink into the sea.
Meanwhile, an orphaned sea gypsy boy named Pari (meaning ""stingray"") is raised in a fishing village, which is constantly under attack by Black Raven's raiding parties. The boy, gifted in the magical art of Dulum, is taken by his uncle Anyar to learn more of the magical ways of the ocean from White Ray, but the sage refuses to teach the boy. Nonetheless, Pari is soon communicating with the marine life. He grows into manhood and becomes a fighter against Black Raven's pirates.
Black Raven, also a practitioner in the Dulum ocean magical arts, has been trying to raise the cannons from the depths of the sea.
Queen Hijau wants her own large cannons and seeks the inventor Lim Kiam, who has been living in the sea gypsy fishing village. She sends away her sisters, Princess Biru (The Blue Princess) and Princess Ungu (The Purple Princess). They will be under the protection of the queen's loyal commander, the fierce silat exponent Lord Yarang.
At the fishing village, Yarang comes under attack. Pari aids Yarang in fighting off the pirates, and Yarang makes his escape. In the confusion, Princess Ungu is believed to have been killed, but she has actually been rescued by Pari and taken to White Ray's remote island.
There, a romance develops between Ungu and Pari, but neither are able to commit. Ungu is due to marry the Prince of Pahang, an important ally of Langkasuka. And Pari is still tortured by the death of his childhood sweetheart Bintang at the hands of Black Raven's men.
In a cave on the island, Pari encounters Black Ray, an evil, unstable alter ego of White Ray, and Pari begins to learn more about Dulum and the conflict between the black and white sides of the practice.
Eventually, all the forces - the rebel prince, the pirates, the ocean sorcerers, the queen and the princesses - will battle for the big cannon.",1389830400,,2888,4.5626204238921

The result is a story that is at the same time classic (you may say cliche, in some cases), epic with its dose of action and heroic characters (Lord Jarang and Pari on everyone else), and a very particular twist (the magic of the Du Lum).

4093020,5,B00393SFTS,"An unashamed, marvel of mishmash genres this high action and imaginative sea adventure is probably an undiscovered gem for most fans of fantasy. Think the Princess Bride meets Pirates of the Caribbean with Bruce Lee as the captain. This movie has it all. Martial arts, sea battles, revenge, romance, intrigue and even magic. If this sounds like too much or overly convoluted then you are sorely mistaken as everything fits so well and never feels tacked on you can't help but love every minute of this beautiful constructed fantasy epic hybrid.

The story is loosely based on the Thai legend of Langkasuka and starts when Prince Rawai, who has allied himself with pirates, attacks the ship carrying a Dutch cannon master and his cannons to be delivered to Queen Hijau to protect her kingdom of, you guessed it, Langkasuka. The cannons are lost to sea and only two survive the attack the Chinese inventor, who helped build the cannons, and a baby boy named Pari.

After the Cannons are lost the Queen and Pirates both spend the better part of two decades trying to amass armies and even reinvent the cannons that were lost to ensure victory for their respective sides. I won't say much more as this gives the main points of the movie without giving too much away. The action scenes are well choreographed and executed and the effects are extremely well done especially the aquatic marine animals. The costuming is also a step above as well making each faction in the movie very unique while still looking authentic.
With all this said the movie does suffer from some pacing issues but nothing that will disenchant you from continuing to watch. There are also a few, maybe like two, scenes where you can see certain swords not making contact or obviously not running a person through. Honestly these things have more to do with missed editing opportunity or camera angles but otherwise do not overly distract too much.

All in all this a roll licking kick ass movie and I highly recommend it to fans of fantasy and action. I would also say that like any international movie it is more enjoyable to watch it with the native audio on and English subtitles. 4.5 stars hands down!!!",1358380800,2,2176,4.736147757255937
4093021,4,B00393SFTS,"Though difficult to follow at first, once  all the characters and relationships are established, the movie moves quickly into quality entertainment.  The interwoven subplots are necessary to explain the ""legend"".  This movie is well worth the watch if you enjoy the mythical genre. The heroines are strong and willing to sacrifice their own desires and lives to the survival of country and people.

The dialogue (subtitles) is almost childish like the plot, and at times confusing. In short, it's watchable if you have nothing else to do for 2.5 hours.

As for the title???!!! There was no tsunami! More like a few humans capable of manipulating water and fish! Who came up with this title? Did they watch the movie first??!!",1341878400,,457,4.858974358974359
4093027,5,B00393SFTS,"I've pushed watching this movie back for several months. Finally, I decided to play it through streaming (on Netflix as of 6/13/12). To my surprise, Tsunami Warrior brings a unique fantasy epic that I truly enjoyed.

The story is about a rebel war against the queen. Each side really needs cannons to beat the opposing force. Each side also has their own set of allies. There is the queen's army, the rebels, some ninjas, pirates, and even sorcerers. The magic used throughout the story is called Du Lum, which has a light and a dark side; think of it kind of like Star Wars, they even use a similar Force Push. The Du Lum is also used to summon sea critters for assistance. There are martial arts and weapons based fights along the whole movie, leading to an epic war from sea to kingdom. The movie is a mixture of action, adventure, fantasy, and some romance.

I was interested throughout the entire movie, especially when it starts to pick up about 30 minutes in. The settings were also great. I don't have any complaints in the acting. My complaint comes from the weak special effects, but I quickly got over it. I enjoyed the movie because it's so different from the regularly released movies. For anyone looking for something out of the ordinary, I highly recommend it.

4093028,5,B00393SFTS,"This movie was a nice surprise.  Very well done.  Solid story and solid acting. Beautiful cinematography.

I agree with reviews that indicate a folklore story-telling style. But, I disagree with the reviews that give the impression of multiple unconnected story threads.  It's one story about a queen who needs to protect her land and her people.  But, there are several characters who play a part in being either allies or enemies to the queen. Each story thread provides the background information on key allies/enemies who surround the queen, and what has motivated or is motivating their actions.

Nice fight scenes.  There was a particularly cool fight scene, which seemed to be a show down between Mway Thai and Ninjitsu. Since seeing Ong Bak, I've been convinced that Muay Thai is the deadliest martial art ever.  Lots of Muay Thai moves were incorporated into the Queen's lead warrior's fighting style - definitely entertaining.

If you don't mind reading sub-titles, I highly recommend this movie if you are imaginative and enjoy action adventures.",1329696000,,1057,5.1345029239766085

After watching it I must say I was very very pleased with it, Even though  the movie is written in English subtitle, it had a very well thought out plot. The movie kept my interest from beginning to ending. It's action filled as well as having other story lines, that all tie in together. Its a worth watch movie. You will not be disappointed with this one. Rent it, stream it, or buy it, you will be happy you did.",1329523200,2,530,4.086538461538462

Its decent don't know if I would watch it again but it was worthwhile to see.
Slightly different viewpoint than Chinese or Japanese similar genres.  I would say more ""innocent"" storyline, ergo the folk tale.

Acting and direction was fine.  Character development good.  Nice scenery.  Dont know if I agree w/the title.",1319241600,,390,4.923076923076923
4093031,3,B00393SFTS,"The most confusing part of this movie was the plot, or plots, or understanding the direction the story and its motley plots are taking.  In the beginning these giant, powerful cannons are lost in battle and sink to the bottom of the sea.  Some Princess anticipating more of an unending battle with her nemesis wants to retrieve them, but they're just too gosh-darned deep.  So this princess' engineers try to recreate the technology, but fail.  Our attention then begins to shift between a love story of sorts, a fisherman-sorcerer whose powers grants all the insights offered by your local weather forecast and allow communication with sea life, a sundered tale of betrayal and revenge, a sorcerer who employs a cadre of pirates and Thai-style ninjas, another maybe-not-bad sorcerer, flashbacks involving some Dutchmen and the cannons, and a Dragonball-like sorcery training session.  Basically a whole lot of sorcery and a whole lot of random crammed into a whole lot of generally slow-paced movie.  Two hours of it to be exact.  But wait, towards the end we come full circle back to the cannons in a siege battle.

 Just about everything in this movie is of inconsistent quality.  The combat choreography is not complex, some of the moves are filmed crisply while others seem poorly executed, and a few solid acrobatics are snuck in among other lethargically-wired maneuvers.  This movie features beautiful underwater shots and gorgeous set design.  However, the CGI effects (when they are not CGI sea creatures) are of inconsistent quality and the wardrobe follows suit, ranging from stunning to uninspired.  Most outfits are dull and maybe authentic, but then the team of assassins in the beginning had the most impressive garbs of the entire movie.  What gives?

 That said, it appeared that they were trying really hard to make this a Thai mega-adventure movie.  I can respect that.  I'd never watch this movie again, but I wouldn't necessarily suggest that you never watch it.  I have a feeling that you'll either love it (like many an Amazon reviewer seemed to) or just feel ""eh"" after watching it (like me).

 This is a mediocre Asian saga movie.  It's like they tried to combine Pirates of the Caribbean without the comic relief and Red Cliff without the awesome.",1316044800,,2274,4.976127320954907
4093032,5,B00393SFTS,"The Legend Of The Tsunami Warrior (original Thai title - Puen Yai Jon Salad) takes place in a fantastical centuries-ago Thailand, where a peaceful and prosperous coastal kingdom is threatened by the increasingly bold raids of a small army of cutthroat pirates.  As the land's benevolent queen and her allies attempt to navigate the diplomatic waters and gather allies - often at great risk of life and limb - to stand against the murderous anarchy, two warriors end up leading the struggle on the battlefront.  One is an extraordinarily skilled young member of the royal guard. The other is a man who was orphaned during a pirate raid years back, and now seeks to learn the ancient art of 'Du Lum' (I believe that's what it was called) - a magic that can control the oceans and its creatures - to fight back against the pirates and avenge his family.

  In this fast-moving, twist-filled adventure tale, there's tremendous imagination and all kinds of surprises and plotlines running.  The most powerful cannon ever built lies sunken at the bottom of the sea and both sides seek to retrieve it; the orphaned warrior seeks out the last living master of Du Lum, who refuses to teach it to anyone for fear of its destructive power; the backstory of various characters becomes revealed.  Come to think of it, it sounds very much like a live-action anime, and I think this will have great appeal for anime fans, as well as fans of everything from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings-The-Motion-Picture-Trilogy-Platinum-Series-Special-Extended-Edition/dp/B000654ZK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)</a>&nbsp;to Chinese historical epics like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Warlords/dp/B003DVB7F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Warlords</a>&nbsp;to Thai action-eers like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ong-Bak-The-Thai-Warrior/dp/B0009VBTQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ong-Bak - The Thai Warrior</a>.  Cool special effects, engaging heroes and villains, astonishing action sequences and spectacular visuals all help raise this one way up.  Another thing I liked was the way they set up the 'good guys vs. bad guys' scenario this time around.  Often with a story like this you have the good kingdom and the evil kingdom.  The good kingdom is present, along with the good kingdom's attempts to search out like-minded allies.  But instead of an evil kingdom per se, we've got a loose association of pirates, mercenaries and assasins from all over the place - Thailand, Java, I think Burma was the homeland of some of them - all gathered together for their own gains.  Nice change of pace.

  While some will think that some of the more dynamic action sequences were overkilled a bit, and some will think that some of the drama tended toward the melodramatic, I don't really agree.  It all fit in with the huge, epic feel of the tale being told.

  And kind of on topic with 'huge, epic feel', who can resist the sight of vicious marauders on the open seas being opposed by heroes riding in on the backs of giant manta rays?  And to answer any questions, it DIDN'T come off campy.  You need style to make that kind of thing work so well, and the filmmakers here have it.
