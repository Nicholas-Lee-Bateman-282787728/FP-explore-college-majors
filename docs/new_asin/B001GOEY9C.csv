8306374,4,B001GOEY9C,"A gripping, gritty black and white film of the 1960s, set in an Irish prison,  portraying the tranformation, of a law and order, by-the-book, neophyte Warden, from his belief in the appropriateness of capital punishment, to the realization he was assisting in the state sanctioned murder of another human being. The Irish poet, Brendan Behan, was the author of the play on which this film was based. Patrick McGoohan gives a convincing performance as the unthinking prison warden who comes to question and regret his complicity in a prisoner's hanging.
Still relevant in our own century, and decade, the film would be more powerful if the dialogue of the working class prisoners were made clearer, perhaps by subtitles, since their local accents and articulation had me missing out on many lines.",1457308800,,796,5.076335877862595
8306375,4,B001GOEY9C,"Patrick McGoohan and Sylvia Syms in their youth and an adapted play from the wonderful Brendan Behan...who could ask for more?  The black and white movie is set in a prison where a new idealistic guard has just arrived.  He is prepared to witness the hanging of the ""quare fellow"", or condemned man.  It's just a part of he job, he thinks.  Then he meets the man's wife and hears the real story behind the man's crime.  He is changed by both her story and his interactions with some of the other prisoners, and the race is on to save the ""quare fellow.""",1436400000,,553,4.330097087378641
8306376,4,B001GOEY9C,"Very good film rendering of Brendan Behan play set in a Dublin prison in late 50's, dealing with the inherent Irish conflict with conservatism.  The title simply refers to queer being ""odd"".  It is at turns wistful, dramatic and profoundly philosophical.  If you enjoy other British dramas from the same period such as Look Back in Anger and The Entertainer, you will be moved by this one as well.  Also it features the great Patrick McGoohan in a very sensitive part unlike all his authoritative Secret Agent roles.  But all the actors are excellent here; as is the direction and photography.  This would make a very good choice to watch for St. Patrick's Day instead of all the blarney tripe like The Quiet Man.",1424908800,5,713,4.709677419354839
8306377,5,B001GOEY9C,"I was pleasantly surprised to find this on Amazon prime. Worth watching just for the old scenes of Dublin.

The ending is very moving.",1420416000,,134,4.583333333333333

8306379,4,B001GOEY9C,"This film adaptation of Irish playwright Brendan Behan's drama against capital punishment charms subtly.  In fact, everything about it is low-key.  Inattentive viewers might even miss key elements.  Patrick McGoogan ably plays Crimmins, a new prison guard eager to see the inmates pay their just debt.  Walter Machen is the veteran guard Regan, whose view of capital punishment and prison in general is considerably more nuanced.  At question is the fate of ""the quare fellow,"" a never-seen, never-heard inmate found guilty of murdering his brother.  Will his execution go off as scheduled or will Regan and Crimmins in concert with Kathleen, the quare fellow's wife (Sylvia Syms), manage to have it called off?  The movie is one of those filmed play types, and is dated into the bargain,  but the questions it raises have neither been answered nor gone out of style.",1393372800,4,867,5.056338028169014
8306380,4,B001GOEY9C,"Very sad movie. Certainly a commentary on the cruelty of the death penalty....not only for the condemned, but also for the family and the justice system that have to carry it out.",1393286400,,179,4.625
