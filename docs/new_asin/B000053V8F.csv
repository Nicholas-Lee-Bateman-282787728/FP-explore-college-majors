1390607,2,B000053V8F,"I was very dissapointed in this revision of the perfect DUNE.  The actors did not grab me as did the original movie, they seemed as if they were trying to hard, it didn't come across naturally.  The special effects were very nice but, again the original had more depth, the actors were real.  I understand that it is very difficult to improve the perfection of the original movie, nice try.",976060800,3,390,4.542857142857143
1390608,4,B000053V8F,"Ah, yes, the crowning masterpiece of the novel Dune in a TV miniseries.  Perhaps the best part of this whole movie is the fact that it follows the book pretty closely.  There are a few MINOR changes, but the overall effect of the novel can be found in the miniseries.
The characters in the miniseries have the same development as those in the novel.  Yes, Paul can seem to be a bit annoying and whiny, but this comes with the territory because of his Messiah complex.  Perhaps the best performance is done by Cheni, Jessica, and Jessica's adominination of a daughter. As a result, the characters are a real plus to the miniseries.
The scenery of Arrakis, and the worms of the planet are simply awesome.  Finally, a director has gotten the correct feel of what Dune really looked like, and what the worms were like.  Personally, I think that the images of Dune and the worms are accurate and again add to the success of the miniseries.
Perhaps the greatest difference between this movie and the previous movie, is the fact that this movie plays more on the political environment found on Dune.  The whole basis of the book is on what is occuring in the local politics and how rebellion will affect the overall rule of the Galaxy.  Again, since the political scheme of the novel is found here, it only adds to the success of this movie.
So why does this movie fail to get five stars?  For one thing, some of the special effects  and acting are second rate.  For example, there are numerous fight scenes in the movie that seem too choreographed.  Perhaps they could have drawn out the fights and produced more realistic blood in order to make it seem more lively.  Another reason the movie does not get five stars is because it gets boring at certain parts, but again this could be the negative drawback of following the book very closely.
There are many positives in this movie such as roles played by Cheni, Jessica, and Alia.  Added to this is the images of Dune and of the worms.  Due to the limited number of negatives, the movie is a crowning success.  It should be highly recommended to anybody who has read the book.",976060800,2,2121,4.513089005235602
1390609,5,B000053V8F,"The first time I read Dune, I was in the eighth grade, desperate for science fiction.  I was astounded; it was as complex a novel as I could have hoped for.  Now, years later, I still find depth to the work every time I read it.  I've read the series more times than I can count, and even though I have to force myself to finish ""Children of Dune,"" the books as a whole have inspired me like no other work.
Therefore, especially considering Lynch's admirable - but ultimately lacking - attempt at a screen ""Dune,"" this miniseries had a LOT to live up to.  Never once did it disappoint.  In fact, the two versions are totally different animals, and comparisons are probably unfair; as far as I'm concerned, this miniseries is the ONLY Dune.
This miniseries managed to totally and completely capture Herbert's vision, leaving a vast majority of the depth of the original book intact.  The costumes accurately reflected an empire mired in politics and complacency, and the harsh desert reality of Arrakis as well.  The sets were excellent; it was nice to have shots of Arrakeen from the air, and everything from the design of the Guild's spaceships to the Navigators themselves to the wonderfully crafted palace on Arrakis fit the tone perfectly.
The dialogue - or at least some of it - was created to make up for the nonexistent voiceovers and internal monologues.  Never once, though, did the casual viewer have to sit there and say, ""What the heck is going on?""  Everything seemed to flow together coherantly, and it only dragged as it was trying to introduce the characters and plot situations in the first hour or so.  The almost minimalist score never detracted from the movie, and faded almost perfectly into the background, creating a uniquely Arrakeen atmosphere.
There were some changes for the miniseries, most notably that Paul is a little more ""human"" than he was in the book; he acts much more like a teenager being forced to move from the comforts of his home to a place he doesn't want to go, and then has responsibility that he doesn't want and can't refuse handed to him.  This changes his character slightly, especially at the first part of the movie, but Alec Newman develops the character beautifully.  The second major change is the introduction of Irulan as a major player, first establishing her as a kindred spirit for Paul, suggesting their marriage may not be as loveless as the books portray them, and setting the stage for her betrayal in Dune Messiah, which should, if this miniseries does well enough, be produced along with Children of Dune as another miniseries from SciFi.
The acting was a little bad in places, especially minor characters, and the voices sometimes sounded like the dubbing didn't always capture the correct pitch; one line would sound like a character spoke it in the desert, his next line like he was in a cave - but he was still in the desert.  In addition, the Baron Harkonnen spoke these stupid rhyming couplets at the end of his speeches that weren't in the book; the man was supposed to be a monster, not Shakespeare.  It was a nice reference, but a little overused and a little out of character.
The only other issue was that almost everything was shot on a soundstage, and it certainly shows, especially in the desert scenes.  In fact, many of the backgrounds look painted, which doesn't necessarily detract from the film; in fact, it gives it an almost play-like or opera-like quality that is certainly present in the novel, and is more than appropriate for the scale of the drama that unfolds.
Dune is destined to become a science fiction masterpiece worthy of Herbert's name.  There are rumors of a DVD release, perhaps with the half-hour or so of scenes deleted for content and length from American TV, but that European audiences got to see.  If there is no DVD, I'll be one of the first to get a copy of this tape.",975974400,55,3877,4.677941176470588
1390610,5,B000053V8F,"Look, this was an astonishing take on a timeless epic. to tread upon its ground, to make an attempt at even the slightest alteration, is to invite some kind of death, some kind of humiliation, unless it is done flawlessly. and here it is. i could not believe my eyes. the transition between book and movie is invisible. each complements the other in a harmonious unison. grandeur with intelligence. beautiful. like a dream only so tangible. you cant afford a hypnosis session...here is your escapade. buy it now now now!",975888000,2,520,4.788888888888889

1390612,5,B000053V8F,"A little different interpretation than the movie; however with the time allotted to a mini-series there was more time for detail.

Now this is a very entertaining mini-series. The time was taken to explain more instead of just implying things and making you guess what they are talking about. Not using such spectacular sets forced then to do some fairly good acting to make up for that. The story did not come to an abrupt end. This leads me to thing it is left open on purpose as a pilot for a TV series.

Many complex plots overlap, from greed over a commodity to a peoples struggle to be free. We see all the spectrums of the good and bad of mankind. We see also a Joseph Campbell type of hero's struggle where the sleeper awakes.",1506643200,5,734,4.389705882352941

1390615,4,B000053V8F,"I own the 1984 Dune movie which I though was pretty good except for being really over the top in Harkonnen disgusting (to me) gore. This Dune 2000 movie was pretty good too, it being a bit closer to the book than the original. Though I liked the actors in the original much better than this one. However, the biggest flaw in Dune 2000 is there are NO subtitles. I love subtitles in movies. A bit hard of hearing you see.

With a bit of time and effort, my Dune 2000 now has English subtitles!!

1. I downloaded the SRT subtitle files for this movie from the Subscene web site. Available in many languages.
2. I ripped the two Dune 2000 DVD disks though DVD Decrypter (free) to my hard drive.
3. Merged the VOB files for each of the 3 episodes (thus making 3 disks instead of the two originals) through VOBmerge252 (free) into one VOB files for each episode. I used VLC (free) to view and manage these VOB files.
4. Then ran each of the these 3 episode VOB files through Winx DVD Author (free), added the subtitle file and then burned to DVD.

Cringing and groaning and cursing through the parts I

didn't just FF through, hoping for some? part that wasn't

cringe worthy. The black haired Leto and Paul? Or

Hollyweird talking up a blonde Skywalker look? The Kid was

such an obnoxious brat (Paul) I just wanted to smack him.

The wrinkled ancient Rev. Mother? Just got a fine face

lift and is cowed by the brat instead of vice versa? Wm

Hurt just mumbles and looks bored throughout. Jessica acts like a teenager not a BG or Leto's partner. I guess making everyone Youthful! and Modern! is de rigeur at all costs. The original 80s film at least tried to do justice to book. Had a great look, not the Star Wars/Iraq war theme. Frankly, still waiting for the real Dune approximation. Wonder if it is such a powerful book that there's some conspiracy to keep it from being made into a decent film? Too much Middle Eastern atmosphere perhaps?

1390619,4,B000053V8F,"As others have noted, this miniseries follows the novel much more faithfully than Lynch's film, though it still doesn't get into some of the more intricate plot points (at least, I didn't notice anyone referring to the Bene Gesserit program of seeding planets with religious myths to prepare them for the coming of someone like the Muad'Dib). Simplifying the plot is obviously necessary, and if you haven't read the book, this miniseries may still be impossible to follow.

Despite its obviously low budget, I was amazed at the creativity of the effects people and set designers. They used a lot of clever colored lighting and shadows to disguises the deficiencies in the visuals (especially exteriors in the desert), and most of the time it works very well. On the other hand, the interior palace sets are very impressive, and the costumes are excellent. Ian McNeice is perfectly cast as Baron Harkonnen, and Saskia Reeves makes a memorable Lady Jessica. Alec Newman as Paul takes some getting used to at first, but eventually I came to like his performance.",1494720000,,1059,4.949438202247191

1390638,5,B000053V8F,"The toughest thing about reviewing this miniseries will be the fact that Harrison stuck so close to the book (in composition). Which I do like because I don't like reading a book and have the movie/miniseries totally different. The inside of the palace at Arakeen was beautiful, but didn't improve on the Lynch's movie set in my book. I think that William Hurt did a good job. I feel that he understood how to react as the Regal Duke who
sacrifices himself for the good of his family and his royal house. He is somewhat depressed by this (as he shows us) but is also forced
forward by things beyond his control. The head-dresses were beautiful in my opinion. If you are a Dune 'purist' I think you'll like the Harrison miniseries better. If you're a movie buff, the Lynch version will probably standout for you. But I suggest watching it with an open mind and make your own conclusion.",1476748800,8,885,4.5375

1390657,5,B000053V8F,"This series is truly awesome. I get blown away every time I watch it. It follows the book closely; where changes are made they are reasonable.

I've seen people criticise some of the insane costume design, but this seems odd to me. The story is set in a 10,000 year old decadent empire, of course their clothing would be crazy.

The use of surreal lighting is a bit odd, but it strikes me that this entire series works much better if it is regarded as a televised stage play, rather than a typical ""realistic"" presentation. Things like the lighting being used to add emotional depth to scenes rather than realism, and the use of a physical photographic backdrop for desert scenes then make a lot more sense.

The only thing I would like is a re-release with updated effects, to take account of the advances in CGI that have occurred in the last 16 years. The CGI is truly terrible and if that were redone (which couldn't be too expensive these days) it would then be pretty much perfect.",1469318400,,987,4.5027932960893855

Lady Margot Fenrig is missing & replaced by Irulian where needed.  There are several invented scenes added of the Emperor that contradict his character as established in the novels.

I still prefer the David Lynch version, despite its limitations. Although it was an extremely abbreviated portrayal, I believe it really captured the essence, atmosphere, and depth of the characters as intended by Mr. Herbert. I don't believe Frank Herbert would be completely disapponted by the made-for-television version, other than some blatant discrepancies:

-The costumes are RIDICULOUS, ...making this serious science fiction novel appear more like some spin-off of ""Star Trek the Next Generation"".
-Many of the actors are entirely unconvincing in their roles: Duke Leto Atreided gives one the impression of a farmer from Nebraska or a used-car salesman from Kansas, ...rather than a prominent nobleman of the imperium. Vladimir Harkonen is supposed to be a severely evil, sadistic, devious, homosexual psychopath, an utterly vile and degenerate human-being ruthlessly obsessed with revenge. In this movie, he comes across as little more than a corpulent, effeminently foppish, and completely un-scary flamboyent pimp, or maybe a designer of ""haute couture"".
-Where are the ornithopters? The primary terrestrial aircraft in Dune were ornithopters (aircraft that fly by oscillation of the wings), ...not jet aircraft.

On the other hand:
-At least there were no ""wierding modules"".
-The sand-worms are much more predatory in appearance.
-This version is still a more complete telling of the tale, ...and they made some of the sequels!",1407110400,,1684,5.51937984496124

The David Lynch movie stank the first time I saw it back in '84, in just about every way a movie can stink. Terrible plotting, dark, boring sets, costumes stolen from some 80s punk band, and with only a few exceptions, terrible acting all around. This mini-series was alive from the first frame to the last and made for gripping entertainment that very faithfully conveyed the essence of the book. In fact, after finally reading Frank Herbert's Dune, I actually felt the mini-series did a better job of bringing the world and the characters to life (blasphemy, I know!), but true for me.

1390753,5,B000053V8F,"Frank Herbert was one of the hardest working authors of our time, and his book shows up to readers as the sci-fi equivalent of Lord of the Rings, and it shows. It is also a very contemporary message, not mere fiction--it is a visceral commentary on our own world, as well as the world of 10,191. This film truly made up for what the other, older big-screen movie lacked--although both films have their proud moments. The costumes, international-cast acting, and set decorations are excellent, and the stylizing, particularly the lighting effects and special effects, were remarkable. My only wish was that there were more deleted scenes included in the final package, and that the dessert scenes were fully outdoors, but otherwise, one might not have been able to tell the difference. A great version of this book and it's sequel was just as well done. I recommend this version right alongside the 1984 film, for it helps to flesh out the story through an explanation of the galactic human civilization of 10, 191 as a year not all too different from 2014; a universe that thrives on the exploitation of 'Spice' as much as our Oil, and the dramatic revealing of souls in both universes to be just as respectably real.",1394064000,5,1217,4.7725118483412325

Hurt doesn't come across well as an aristocrat and a man who has earned the respect of all the great houses of the Lansraad. Alec Newman comes across as being far too arrogant. He was truer to the character in Children of Dune. Still, it was better than the original (with concession to the fact that Lynch had just over two hours and this four plus).",1391731200,,561,4.456310679611651
1390756,4,B000053V8F,"After the 1984 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dune/dp/B000ICZD5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dune</a>&nbsp;reached cult-classic status, it must have seemed something of a daunting task to adapt Frank Herbert's science-fiction saga into a television miniseries, even given the added running time that it afforded. Yet despite the popularity of the film, there was certainly much that could have been improved on, particularly in fleshing out the nuances of the novel.

Where the film could only capture the storyline and characters in broad strokes, the two hundred and sixty five minute run-time of the miniseries means that things can unfold at a much more leisurely pace, giving the viewer a chance to understand the complexities of the political situation and the intricate plotting that various factions undergo in their attempts to consolidate power.

Set at some point in the *very* distant future, the planet of Arrakis is at the centre of growing galactic turmoil. The only planet in the known universe that can produce spice, the near-priceless substance that makes space-travel possible, as well as grant extended life and prophetic visions, it is a commodity that ruling houses will fight ruthlessly for.

The story opens with the powerful Padishah Emperor (Giancarlo Giannini) sending the noble Atreides family to govern Arrakis in place of the brutal Harkonnens, knowing full-well that their takeover will be fraught with danger and bloodshed. Though Duke Leto Atreides (William Hurt), his bound concubine Jessica (Saskia Reeves) and their fifteen year old son Paul (Alec Newman) adapt surprisingly well to the harsh conditions of the desert planet, the Harkonnens are unwilling to give up their monopoly on spice, and place a traitor within the Atreides household.

When the attack comes, Paul and his mother must rely on the desert-people known as the Fremen for their survival, a suspicious and xenophobic population that have their own set of beliefs regarding Paul and his destiny, and who guard the secrets of the deserts and the natural production of spice. Harnessing what his father called ""desert power"", Paul makes his own play for control against the cruel Harkonnens and the mighty Imperium.

This really only skims the surface of Herbert's magnum opus, referred to by some as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Lord-of-the-Rings/dp/0618517650/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Lord of the Rings</a>&nbsp;of science-fiction. Delving into religion, ecology, politics, mysticism, and the question of fate versus free will, the novel is a complex work of fiction that yields further insight with each rereading. In that light it seems impossible that any adaptation could do it justice, but this makes a valiant attempt. All the major plot-points are touched upon, and though some characters are dropped or merged with others, most of the cast embody their roles well.

As with most ensemble casts, there are certain actors that stand-out and those that fade into the background. Alec Newman is an adequate Paul Atreides, though he doesn't really foster a great rapport with the audience. A little stiff at times, I felt more invested in him as a symbol than a person, and he only really came alive when opposite Barbora Kodetov as Chani (who might be a little too curvy to be an accurate portrayal of a water-starved desert-dwelling girl, but who is otherwise so striking that she easily becomes the heart of the miniseries, the rock upon which our emotional investment in the Fremen cause lies).

Strangely enough, Newman is brilliant in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-of-Dune/dp/B00008RUYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children of Dune</a>, capturing the wisdom and weariness of the character in such a way that's totally missing here, where in woodenness he's matched only by William Hurt, who seems to be in some sort of trance for the duration of his screen-time. But I enjoyed Saskia Reeves as Jessica, and was disappointed when she was replaced by Alice Krige for the aforementioned sequel ""Children of Dune"" (even though most seem to approve of the change. But Reeves manages to bring both strength and vulnerability to the role of a woman who is in over her head, yet determined to adapt and survive.

Also noteworthy is Ian McNeice as the slimy Baron Harkonnen and Julie Cox as Princess Irulan, whose extended role in the transition from book to screen is of particular interest. In the novel, she's barely a character. Though her name is affixed to the various epigraphs that are strewn throughout the book's length, their presence is explained in the final chapter when it becomes apparent that she will marry Paul to secure peace - though never truly become his wife. In Jessica's words: ""that princess will have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine - never to know a moment's tenderness from the man to whom she's bound...they say she has pretensions of a literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little else.""

Yet this idea naturally does not translate well to a visual medium, and so the writers here decides to take the opportunity to flesh out Irulan's character. Expanding her role makes Irulan a character in her own right, a compelling figure whose youth belies her cunning mind and who the denouement portrays as a proud yet pitiable figure whose future is cast in shadow.

Any viewer not familiar with the book would probably be rendered baffled by mentions of such things as the Spacing Guild or the Bene Gesserits, and the script walks a fine line between trying to keep the plot moving without getting bogged down in exposition (something that even Herbert's text struggled with). But it's to be commended for its diverse cast, in which a variety of Czech actors play the Fremen, and its production values look remarkably high for what was apparently quite a restrictive budget. Some of the special effects have dated terribly since 2000, and many of the costumes are as ridiculous now as they were back then, but other things like the sand-worms and the elaborate gowns of the women hold up well. And hey, I was actually rather partial to the elaborate head-dresses of the Bene Gesserits. As absurd as they seem, they're also something that you could imagine a religious sect wearing in order to bolster their intimidating image.

Though the miniseries obviously has more time in which to plumb more of the novel's depths, in never really engages fully in the philosophical ideas that Herbert raises, or (with the exception of Irulan) take any risks in the way the story unfolds. Instead, it's happy to simply transcribe events and character beats as faithfully as possible. Depending on whether or not you think an adaptation should be slavishly loyal to the source material or try to keep the spirit of the story whilst telling it on its own terms will probably determine your enjoyment of John Harrison's take on ""Dune"".

There are pros and cons in both film and miniseries, and fans of Herbert's novel will no doubt take something from each of them.",1391385600,,7198,5.271378708551484

In comparison to the original David Lynch movie, Harrison is able to offer far better character development and tell the story cinematically.

1390781,4,B000053V8F,"This is it-- the Special Edition, widescreen, 3-disk Director's Cut of the Emmy-winning Sci-Fi Channel's miniseries version of DUNE. It stars William Hurt, Alec Newman, Giancarlo Giannini, Saskia Reeves, and the gorgeous Barbora Kodetova as Chani. Almost 5 hours of top-notch sci-fi!

Finally done as a tale of this scope must be done --as an extended series-- with much better character development and plot continuity than Lynch's film version was ever able to convey in its limited time frame (and budget). The acting is great, and the screenplay is quite faithful to Herbert's original story, with a few enhancements intended to convey subtleties not easily converted to film.

Of course Herbert fans and Sci-Fi fans in general would wish that someone would make a version that was COMPLETELY in line with the novel (Peter Jackson, perhaps?). . . but of course, that's probably not possible in a film format. At least not if the producers don't want to go broke in the process. (Are you listening, Pete? This could be a challenge. . . .) A version that had some of the best special effects, lighting, mood, and music from Lynch's version, combined with the length and development of this one (without the obvious breaks for commercials), would sure be nice.

But anyway, as it stands now this made-for-cable version is still the best one available, by far. Honestly, the first time I saw Lynch's movie I felt sorry for anyone who hadn't read the book and wasn't already familiar with all of the characters and plot points that whisked by, in seconds. This miniseries version stands on its own. It develops the story fully, fleshes out all the characters nicely, and has much more inspired casting (not just ""which stars are available this month""--probably what killed Lynch's budget)

Oh yes-- and Barbora is sooooo much more believably tough and sexy than Sean was, as Paul's love interest.

I know more than one person who was introduced to Herbert's tale via this miniseries when it ran on cable (commercials and all), and have since become real fans of the book.

This (3-disk) version includes thirty minutes of never-before-seen footage, and a huge amount of extras-- production & cast commentary, 5 separate featurettes, a sci-fi author's round-table discussion, a critique-essay, photo gallery, etc. So if you like Dune, and want some great images to link to your memories of it, Get This Version!",1368230400,,2409,4.980099502487562

1390803,5,B000053V8F,"Dune is the first book (actually three sub-books) of an astounding award-winning Science Fantasy epic by Frank Herbert, that ultimately consisted of seven total original books over 7,000 pages.  This movie, along with its sister movie, ""Children of Dune"" is EXTREMELY lengthy and complex, with dozens of pertinent role-playing characters.

Twice before, this movie was attempted.  The first was widely acclaimed, yet juvenile in its approach and special effects; the second was a flop.

This third movie is a welcomed, adult approach giving validity to the unique universe within.

The basic story line revolves around a spice called Melange that permits certain users to ""see"" the future.  The spice is only ""grown"" on a single planet, and various factions or ""houses"" seek to control that planet.  However, an unexpected human of unnatural capacity arrives a generation early within a breeding program, who's unusual vision brings forward a much broader, expansive destiny for the universe.  Still, his inner conflict with the death and destruction mandated by his fate constantly imprisons him to an irreversible path he initiates.

As a Hugo/Nebula award winner as one of the greatest ever epics of its genre, this story introduces many mind-boggling concepts and explores the ramifications in depth.  One can imagine how prescience alone would alter mankind irrevocably, yet that is miniscule to the other deeply astounding concepts entwined within this and its sister movie.

Having a HUGE array of characters with their own multitude of ploys makes this story, at times, difficult to follow (I recommend reading the books), yet the story is told in a very adult fashion.  Themes of romance, war strategy, religion, deceit, technology, planetary politics, culture and etiquette all play intertwined roles in this vast story.

For those simply seeking a very good story, this, though lengthy and complex is among the best.  For those seeking science fantasy at its best, this story is unparalleled  in ingenious diversity of epic proportions.

This is a must-see movie, and the ""Children of Dune"" must follow!",1358035200,3,2114,5.303303303303303
1390804,4,B000053V8F,"If you're looking to watch Dune on your TV now that you have read it, there is this miniseries, and David Lynch's movie. If you want to watch something that follows the book more closely, watch the miniseries. If you are wondering what a bad trip feels like, watch the Lynch movie. This miniseries is the best Dune film out there. The Lynch movie is based on Dune, then runs off with it somewhere over the hills and far away. Still, it's an interesting movie to watch when you are in the mood for fascinating surreal things.

Movies based on books will always disappoint a little. You fell in love with the book, or you enjoyed it and had certain expectations for a movie based on it. Maybe the movie put emphasis on all the wrong things or failed to address what you interpreted as a key element in the book. Maybe the actors don't really play the characters well, or are not what the book described (or what you interpreted as the book describing) at all. The list goes on. This series won't live up to the Dune that the book has painted in your head. However, this version of Dune is pretty good and entertaining to watch. I love Dune for the sci-fi aspects more than the political intrigue aspects. It's one of my favorite sci-fi universes. I like the miniseries so much because it does a pretty good job on the Dune world. A low budget job, but a good job nonetheless. The sandworms!",1357862400,,1388,4.400778210116732

1390820,5,B000053V8F,"This is a miniseries based on a quite extensive series of novels. There was also an older movie made in the early 80's about the book. It would be great if the old movie and the miniseries could be combined. The background of the story was described better in the older film I think, but the acting special effects and details throughout the middle of the story were better in this miniseries. Overall I think this is my favorite version.

The planet Dune is the wasteland of the galactic empire. However, it is the source of the greatest wealth known to man. On Dune there is a race of people that have been changed by the ""Spice"". The ruling clan has been ousted and the new leadership is being well received. That's not the end of it though. A plot is in motion that willbring tyranny back to the people of Dune. The son of the murdered Duke will lead the people of Dune in a rebellion to reclaim their freedom.

Overall this is a great miniseries. It's not like any other Sci-fi show I've seen. If I had to give you a frame of reference I'd call it a cross between Star Wars and The Chronicles of Riddick. That may seem kind of odd, but that's the best comparison I can think of. I also have the sequel entitled ""Children of Dune"".

Just finished reading Dune for the second time only. Very most worthy of a re-read. The biggest disconnect I noticed was super trivial in that Irulan did not attend dinner, but the SFCh dinner was perhaps at least as interesting as Frank's.

1390824,1,B000053V8F,"I am baffled by the editorial review asserting that this ""goes a long way toward satisfying science fiction purists"" miffed by Lynch's film, or that it treats ""Herbert's novel with more comprehensive authority"", and a little surprised that anyone finds it stronger in any capacity.  The running length did allow for several details to be covered that were skipped in Lynch's film.  But plenty of additional stuff was thrown in or changed:  plenty of comic relief, the Fremen are made into a weird sex cult, there are new scenes showing worms rising up tamely, made up hallucinations of grass sprouting up, countless lines stuffed into people's mouths that did not fit in the slightest with their character.  Everything about the Fremen culture is wrong. Princess Irulan is given a completely invented subplot.  The tone of relationships is throughly changed.  Critical thoughts that define the world or a character are routinely tossed out & skipped over.  The iconic ""litany against fear"" is changed for no discernible reason.

I don't feel like many of the actors bothered to even read cliff notes of the book, and I sometimes doubt whether any significant percentage of the screenwriters/directors actually read the book.  It was a free-for-all.  Lynch's film certainly made changes but the his constraints were fairly clear and most of his choices had a clear line of reasoning in support of the essential story.

Indeed in the miniseries the essential story still exists but it is arbitrarily tweaked.  Add to that embarrassing production values, costume design apparently by a third-grader.  (If you want a spot a fake paid review, find someone who said the costumes were good.)  The only thing I can think is, this is for kids, and heck yes it'd be cool enough to watch if I were 12 and had no appreciation of the numerous subtle important details, in terms of relationships, choices, and the world itself, that make the novel so genius.

At least two shots were framed in exactly the same way as David Lynch framed them (shots that could've been done plenty of other ways).  To top it all off, they didn't consult anyone on pronunciation.  Harkonnen has a right pronunciation.  Chani has a right pronunciation (they didn't even make the best guess, which is in fact how it is pronounced).

Look typical Friday night and I am more then willing to kill a couple hrs catching dune then 4 hrs of ""Children"", and yes I know I said SUCKS.

THATS the issue - they spent 5/10 minutes on the scene w/Irulan but leave out the significance of the party. Best character yet is Kynes with a noble attempt at Gurney. 1984 actors minus Paul where much more convincing. Anyway - I think the casting is terrible, the costumes where designed by children on crack and for the purist, well like me you're gonna sit through it. I just wish prior to contract signing and paychecks actors should be required to read the books. Anyway -could go on forever, some aspects hold true and others will make you want to kick in you're monitor. Sorry for the negativity but I'm not into glorifying the powers that be for butchering a good book. Bottom line "" If you thought the LTR Jackson trilogy was great -you'll probably like these, if you're a diligent purist have a couple beverages of choice and be happy it's not Ralph Backshi's version. 3 stars because honostly we have no choice, better then nothing.",1340841600,,1726,4.465189873417722
1390827,4,B000053V8F,"I have seen all the videos and enjoyed them all. The production too weird??? Hey! It's REAL SCIENCE FICTION people!!! If you think DUNE is weird, watch some of the LEXX videos. I always thought George Lucas was brilliant by dumbing down the Star Wars universe to 3rd grade level. It sells. And don't get me wrong, I liked SWs. I read a lot of SF that would translate well to the screen but require adult attention and would not go well with the average BIG MOVIE VIEWER's need for instant gratification and short attention span. I read the first six Herbert authored Dune books from 1980-something on and I really gobbled up the Lynch theatrical film because it captured the mood, passion and evil of the Dune Universe. After Herbert's death I have read every prequel and sequel novel. As a result, I was forced to go back and reread several of the original books. I have concluded the DUNE story arc is far too strong to put on any video format because of the dense written dialogue and so much intense convoluted internal thought by the myriad of really interesting characters. Some of the later books would make great film but I am afraid much of the action required would be too gruesome and the scope to broad. Perhaps if Lynch had tried to direct less of an art film and more leaning toward pop culture we would have seen a chain of enjoyable Dune films much like what happened to Star Trek.",1339200000,,1397,4.482352941176471

Although other films may have more famous players, this one is enjoyable through all 3 disks, it's never boring. I've watched it so often the case is wearing out.",1328486400,,420,4.454545454545454
1390842,4,B000053V8F,"I first watched this mini series when it came out and to be 100% honest I judged it (more specifically the first ""book"" of the mini series) by the cult classic feature film version of Dune by David Lynch (which like a few others is one of my favorite films)... Which had its own problems of course. Just different ones than the SiFi channel (Ugh SyFy... more like WyTyFy). So basically I wanted to dislike it, and they gave me plenty of reasons to do just that, when it broadcast I didn't even finish watching the mini series the first time... Perhaps the Directors cut improved it, or my bais for the admittedly also flawed feature film has relaxed; either way this is a MUCH better movie than I recall. Part of this is intentionally not comparing the casting as I watched; the very strong performances in the movie, with in some cases wooden and miscast performances in the series, and part is getting over the fact that the director of the Series clearly loved the art direction in the lynch film, and thus liberally re-used it. The ships and decor all have very familiar art deco mashed up with Victorian look the Film had.

Yes you will have to ""get over"" a few very forehead slapping terminology problems, and things that threaten to jar you out of your suspension of disbelief; Specifically terms like ""Fedykin"" which should be pronounced ""Fey-De-Ah-Keen"" as in the feature not ""Fah-Dyk-in"" and then there's Paul's first love who's name is ""Chaw-nee"" not ""Chain-nee"". Quite a few botches like this. There are two silly looking ""running in place"" green screen action sequences that are terrible (reminding one of Saturday Night Live skits where they run or walk or drive in front of a projections of moving scenery), as well as some very mixed CGI (even compensating for the era when it was done). Some CGI is wonderful: The first Worm sighting when it rockets out of the sand, actually reminded me of newer ultra realistic CGI in monster movies like Cloverfield, especially the well done camera shake shot over their shoulders point of view as it slams back into the ground, quite well done.) while most are so-so (again compensating for the state of the art at that time) but some are simply jarringly terrible (the in-famous CGI mouse). Also wart like is the re-use of earlier ""effect on matt painting"" shots of the city burning using the same shot they used when the Harkonen attacked as they do for Pauls triumphant return at the end. Also glaringly bad, is the same ""warehouse exploding in little pops of firework-like explosions"" which is reused at least 4 or 5 times through the movie.

Those things ""gotten past"" or at least quickly forgiven, the series is amazingly faithful to the books, more so than the Feature... As an example The ""weirding way"" in the mini series is correctly; a process of perfect control of ones body and mind, most notable instance; that of speeding up the human body/mind faster than your attacker (Frank Herbert envisioned this as a evolutionary change (with help from Bene Gesserit breeding manipulation of the noble families) being able to speed your own physical time frame up while others were still at a normal speed).. There are no cheezy ""Weirding Modules"" that use thought to trigger sound waves to 'splode rocks (do they really need THOUGHT WAVES for that? can't they just pull the trigger with their finger?). But also notable is the process (part of the weirding way) where Paul and Jessica convert the poison (water of life) into non-lethality by metabolizing the poison and converting it inside themselves) something not explained much (or at all really) but it is true to the books this is not ""Magic"" or supernatural, basically in the Book they can control their own metabolism so well they can operate on the poison at a molecular level the same way our bodies turn complex carbohydrates into basic (less complex) sugars and break down proteins into amino acids.

All of the performers get better and more believably cast after the early sometimes wooden sometimes awkward dialog, almost as if the early scenes the actors (especially the Duke and Paul) weren't fully sold out into their role. Some even manage to be better or comparable to the feature. Paul is very good after the early scenes, Jessica and in particular Chany are wonderfully well played (and Chany better cast than Sean Young her counterpart in the feature) and even the overly wooden performance of Hurt as the Duke seems less so after a few years and whatever added scenes the directors cut put back in (perhaps the scene before the formal dinner scene). Priness Irulan has a much larger role as per the book, and is very well acted/cast.

Looking forward to Children of Dune, and now a little disappointed that they don't seem to be doing God Emperor Of Dune... with all the ""giant aligator"" schlock that SyFy AKA WTFy seem to shovel out, and the two Dune miniseries being hands down the best things that channel ever did it's hard to imagine why...",1327795200,,4979,4.745958429561201

I had read the book prior to wathing the Lynch version and I feel the miniseries is more to form despite its lack of well known stars even though the mini features William Hurt and a few other easily recognized actors. I can hardly beleive that Frank Herbert was involved with the making of the big screen original. The weirding weapons are kinda dumb and the Sardukaur soldiers look like they are wearing black trash bags and welding helmets.

1390861,3,B000053V8F,"I was introduced to the Dune series by way of the David Lynch movie so it will always hold a special place in my heart for that reason alone.  I enjoyed some things abou the miniseries as well.

Pros for the Movie:
  Less elaborate costumes...
  Paul didn't come off as a spoiled brat in the beginning of the movie...he didn't act like that in the book either
  Lady Jessica, played by Francesca Anis, came off as regal and you just knew she had the fist in the velvet glove, I always picture her as Lady J when I read the books
  I loved Jorgen as Duke Leto, thought he did a really great job
  I thought Kyle did a good job at showing Pauls anger and fear at what was happening to him just have to love the whole ""Father, father, the sleeper has awakened"".
  I liked Alec Guiness as Liet Kynes, he made me believe
  I can't remember the name of the actor who played Stil but he did a believable job as well.
  I loved ""hearing"" everyones inner thoughts...that is why I love the books so much
  The baron was more menacing in the movie

Cons for the movie:
  The lessions and blisters all over the baron, just eee[...]
  The music was just really bad 80s stuff
  We barely got to see Duncan
  The weirding module thingy...very lame and wasn't needed
  Sean as Chani
  Making the Bene Gesserits bald, so silly
  Loved SP as RM Giaus Helena, even with her bald head, she was much more compelling and mysterious(the nerve box scene between her and Paul was really good)
  Very choppy and so much was left out and too much added that was rather useless

Pros for the Mini:
  Longer, so more was shown and in better detail
  Love William Hurt, thought he did a good job as well
  Paul becoming less sullen as the series progressed...Alec Newman wasn't the best actor...he did improve though
  Love, love, love the music!!!
  Barbara was a much better Chani
  I liked the guy who played Feyd as well...Sting was just too old for that roll.

Cons for the Mini:
  Hated the change of Irulans character...I hated how she came off as a do gooder, her characterization in the book(with her schemes and intrigues, was more interesting then in the miniseries. It clearly states in the book that she was a flawed BG, yet in the mini she comes off as all knowing and never doing any wrong.(This is my biggest pet peeve with the mini series along with how much of a spoiled brat Paul was in the beginning)
  Absolutely hated most of the costumes, they should have been much simpler.  Especially the headdresses. Hated all the satin just looked too cheap.
  I didn't like how Lady Jessica came off as too whimpy, I don't know if it was the writing or the acting
  The actress who played the RM Giaus Helen, came off as odd but not powerful...I disliked the nerve box scene between her and Paul(I blame both actors for that mess)
  Hated the changes in the formal dinner scene especially with Irulan showing up and coming off as adventure girl
  Some of the actor choices left much to be desired as well as the acting
  Not enough Duncan
  Irulan showing up on Geidi Prime and ""seducing"" the truth out of Feyd...now she is coming off as universal spy girl too bad Feyd didn't strangle her

All in all I do enjoy the miniseries...I have both(the movie and the mini) on DVD. I also have CoD on DVD.",1302307200,2,3279,4.360601001669449

This is a well-directed, well acted story.  The art direction and ""look"" of the film is outstanding.

It's taken me four years to finally sit through the three disc series.
The casting of characters was the worst in movie history. No film that I am aware of has ever messed up so badly on casting actors. I do love William Hurt, but he comes and goes so quickly that there's no reason to watch it any further. You will instantly start comparing this series to the movie and venting your frustration out over the ridiculous acting and wrong looking actors.
Everybody has shaved heads and look like prison camp refugees. They have no personalization.

Everybody in the 1983 Movie was attractive. Even the bald men had unshaved heads. Humans are supposed to have hair.
The Dune movie was perfectly cast and directed. I am totally convinced that the director here with the series was either a woman or a very gay man , and had gotten a lot of their ideas from old comic books. ""If you know what's good for you, you'll come here"". Come on man. I had an image of little orphan Annie with her fists up and daring a fight.
There are many weird and stupid lines like that.
Some things that were just too much to accept were, for one, the Bene Gessserit women were actually dressed up like witches. I was waiting for one of them to pull out a big broom. The Emperors or the Barons Sardaukar soldiers were dressed like a weird Sci-Fi Samurai, bright red costumes with chrome masks and chrome swords. Chani, who was supposed to be beautiful was very not. I don't like writing that, but its true. I have never seen so many unattractive actors in one show. Then you have the constant butchering of the names and words. The eyes were another difficult obstruction to get through. They're supposed to be blue on blue.
Super bright and reflective contact lenses were so annoying.
There were more and more inconsistencies and problematic parts. I had to yet again use the fast forward button on the dismal ending. There was no floor breaking, nor summoning of the rain by Muad'Dib, no demonstration of any
powers of any kind.

The Series Sucked.

The weird thing is that they actually reused the same terrible actors for the next series in the Children of Dune. I just couldn't take any more torture, maybe in another four years.

The only thing good about this series was the CGI-Computer Generated Images. The CGI team did a great job.

  One area where the Miniseries shines is in the casting of Uwe Ochenknecht in the role of Stilgar... Unlike the actor in the first film who was more of a ""big brother"" and showed no sign of doubt or introspection, the casting of Uwe was a master stroke.  A second father to Paul... While a product of his culture... and trapped by its conventions... he can see beyond it.

  While obviously a dangerous man... once on your side you know that this is a man that you can not only trust... but a man with whom you can be comfortable.  Jessica likes him almost immediately and shows consternation when he tells her that he can be replaced... by being called out and killed.

  Uwe (I am not going to type out his last name ever again...) brings warmth, humor and thoughtfulness to his character.  It was unfortunate that he was not in the follow-up, Children of Dune...

1390882,4,B000053V8F,"I've been a Dune fan since the movie came out in 1984.  I hadn't read the book before then, but since the movie was so dark, I knew I had to read it.  (Dark movies are very appealing to me -- ""The Crow"", ""Blade Runner"", etc.)

After reading Dune, and watching the movie, I have to admit that the 1984 version left a bad taste.  I wanted something more, but sadly,  I had to wait until 2000 when Frank Herbert's Dune showed on the SciFi channel.  I was stoked!  But, the finished product was not what I had expected.  My desire for all things ""Dune"" died.  Until...

One quiet evening not too long ago, I downloaded the unabridged version of Dune off of iTunes.  Listening to it made want to see the movie on the big screen once more.  The 1984 rendition was out of the question.  So, I settled for 2000 mini-series.  Listening to the audio version of Dune first helped to refresh the storyline.

Pressing on:

The Storyline: The series holds to the book -- more or less.  There are a few Hollywood liberties, but not too many.  They did a pretty good job of packing the essentials into 3 DVDs.

The Characters: Believable.  I don't see what the complaint is about William Hurt's performance.  He is supposed to be a duke!  He showed the noble reserve and aloofness one would expect.  Alec Newman as Paul -- a good choice for an older Paul, but trying to be a 14-ish year-old teenager in the beginning...uh...just doesn't work.  He is much better as Paul later on.  Saskia Reeves as Jessica -- well, to me, she's not the tough Jessica as portrayed in the book.

The Baron is the baron.  Feyd -- well, he's not a rock star this time.  Alia -- not menacing, but at least she didn't try to burn any houses down like the ""Firestarter"" kid from 1984.  Gurney Halleck -- too old.  I kept waiting for him to fall over in the combat scenes.  Hawat and Idaho -- their involvement was brushed over, in my opinion.  Oh, and they didn't die that way in the book.

Special effects.  Very well done.  The landscape is perfect.  The ships are excellent.  The worms are awesome!  The costumes...well...they are a bit overboard.  However, the story is about Paul -- not some costume designer's whim.

My favorite parts of the series:

1. The Guild Highliners.
2. The worms!
3. Paul's evolution to a Fremen warrior.
4. Riding the worms!
5. The Shield Wall explosion, and the Fremen attack.

Least favorite parts:

1. Did not show much of Caladan.
2. The Navigators.  A bat?!
3. No explanation of the Crysknives.  The book detailed these.
4. Doctor Yueh and Thufir Hawat.  Needed more involvement.
5. Too much Princess Irulan -- Hollywood interpretation.

On the whole, it is a good series to watch.  I'm considering purchasing ""The Children of Dune"".  But, I need to re-read both books first.  Have to come at it fresh.

""Bless the Maker and his water.  Bless his coming and going...""",1275782400,,2865,4.49609375
1390883,4,B000053V8F,"I'm a huge Dune fan. I've read all of the books (even the awful prequels and sequels from Brian and KJA) and pretty much every book Herbert ever wrote. That being said, I think the Sci-fi miniseries is the best we're ever going to get. I have a lot of complaints about it, but overall it's fairly enjoyable to watch. My biggest complaint is that at the beginning of Part 2 (Disc 2 of the 3 disc boxed set), they misspelled Muad'Dib. The screen goes black and you see the title for the second part written as ""Maud'Dib."" I've watched the miniseries numerous times, but I can't get over that blatant spelling error. I don't know what an accurate comparison would be, maybe like watching a miniseries about Nazi Germany and having someone write ""Hilter"" instead of Hitler. It's a glaring error that anyone who has read the book should notice.

The costumes are ridiculous. I imagine they wanted them to look futuristic, but mostly they come off as silly. The stillsuits look good, but they were missing the jubba cloak a lot of the time. In the book, Herbert mentions that the cloak was necessary to protect the fragile stillsuit from light. I guess it would've been too hot to make everyone wear cloaks too. Either way it's just a small omission. Most of the costumes end up looking like runway pieces as opposed to clothes people would really wear. Then again, this is set something like 20,000 years in the future.

The CGI is low budget. They improved this a lot in the 2003 miniseries for Children of Dune. The sets are also obviously sets. The backgrounds look like something painted for high school plays, not a $20 million movie project. The good news is that the CGI and sets portray accurate descriptions of the sandworms and desert. The problem is that they're so low budget. Since CGI is usually done after the movie has been shot, I guess they ran low on funds.

The acting is bad in a lot of places. Paul is portrayed as a whiny teenager, when in the book he starts off completely in control of himself and stays that way the entire time he's alive. A lot of the characters in the book seem superhuman, and because of that they're inhuman. What I mean is that you can't relate to these characters who have control over their entire body (The Bene Gesserit in particular could decide to conceive, make the child a boy or girl, eradicate viruses in their body, extend their life, etc.). My guess is that sticking totally to the novel would've been too difficult or would have resulted in totally emotionless acting. I think it's kind of the same problem with the movie ""Equilibrium."" You have to choose between emotionless acting or humanizing the characters. I think the choice to make them seem more human was good, but Paul shouldn't be so whiny. The Baron Harkonnen should be way more evil and less goofy, but he's much better than the ugly, disgusting Baron in the 1984 movie.

Count Fenring looks more like a pervert than a cold blooded killer. He seems like an afterthought rather than a key player in the final events of the novel. *SPOILER* Fenring decides not to fight for the emperor Shaddam, his lifelong friend, to kill Paul at the end of the novel. In the movie this is glossed over, but in the novel it's important because it demonstrates the transition between the old emperor to the new. Fenring theoretically could have killed Paul, but he decides to do nothing.

Mentats are glossed over. They could have put in a few lines about how they're humans who took on the functions of supercomputers after the prohibition on making ""machines in the likeness of the human mind."" I imagine time was an issue, but I would have liked to see some more character development of Thufir Hawat.

A lot of the book is glossed over or omitted, making the miniseries somewhat difficult to follow without an explanation. I've watched it with friends who know nothing about Dune, and they ask endless questions about what's going on, because you don't get sufficient explanation to really understand what's going on or why things are happening the way they are. Everyone should read the novel before watching the movie to really get a sense of what's going on.

I know these are a lot of negatives, and some are trivial, but I'm afraid this effort from 2000 will be the last for at least a few decades, or maybe the last movie adaptation ever. Dune will never sell like Avatar simply because it's too complicated and asks too much of the reader/viewer, and as such I doubt it will ever be done on a $100+ million budget that it really would need to do it justice. If they could have spent $100 million instead of $20 million, the CGI and costumes probably would have been spectacular instead of ridiculous.

I'm hoping this movie will come out on Blu-ray someday. I'll definitely purchase a copy even though I own the DVD set. I think the Sci-fi miniseries was an excellent effort and is definitely worth watching, especially as a prelude to getting into the novels. I think the negatives are outweighed by the story being close to that of the novel, and many of the characters (Stilgar, Gurney, Irulan, Kynes) are portrayed superbly, albeit at times inaccurately from the point of view of the novel. The production values are fairly good, despite the poor CGI and sets. The movie looks good and has excellent music. I give it 4 stars out of 5 because of the glaring ""Maud'Dib"" spelling error, and because it's still not a perfect Dune adaptation. Despite that, it's worth viewing, and in my opinion, owning. I liked the miniseries a lot, and I think that despite all the negatives I've mentioned, it was well done and stands on its own merits.",1275609600,,5651,4.610337972166998
1390884,5,B000053V8F,"The Sci-Fi Channel's mini series, FRANK HERBERT'S DUNE (2000) is a refreshing shift from the 1984 film, and one that more accurately tells the story, and gives the viewer a better ""feel"" as to the world of Dune. The 20+ million dollars that was spent (a fair chunk at that time) shows in the above-average quality. While the special effects aren't spectacular, they are respectable, and accent the film very well. Furthermore, the environments are eye-pleasing. While the story of Dune is hard to follow for the average viewer, this adaptation manages to keep the viewer interested enough. I think that (contrary to popular belief) Alec Newman's performance as Paul Atreides is very commendable, despite being a young actor. I prefer him over Kyle MacLachlan from the 1984 film. William Hurt is the anchorperson and marquee actor in the miniseries (only because he's an established actor with awards), but doesn't give a great performance. His acting is wooden at best, but it doesn't affect things too much. Finally, the music of Graeme Revell is the icing on the cake, as it's a better soundtrack than Toto's soundtrack in the 1984 film. Toto gave it a shot, but they pale in comparison to an established composer. Revell's music is compelling, feeley, and relevant. Overall, I give this miniseries a stellar rating of 5 stars. I still think that one more movie could be attempted, but if it isn't, I can still live with this one as the ""true"" Dune film.",1274313600,,1456,4.85140562248996
1390885,4,B000053V8F,"Dune is one of those franchises that has a story in society nearly as epic as the material within.  Beginning as a highly praised novel by Frank Herbert way back in 1965, to many the defining moment came in 1984 when a society still caught up in the revelry of George Lucas' original Star Wars trilogy were treated to a theatrical adaptation done by the always-controversial David Lynch.  Suffice it to say, the film was met with mixed reaction and by mixed reaction I mean it generally managed to offend nearly everyone: Non science fiction fans came away off put with the reliance upon monolog and sheer muddled complexity surrounding the political conflict presented.  Perhaps even harsher were the criticisms coming from fans of the novel that felt as though the casting was askew, the plot structure discombobulated, and the beauty of the source material lost in translation.

I presume that had Frank Herbert's source material not been so beloved throughout the years, the live-action Dune saga could well have lived and died in Universal's motion picture effort.  However, legions of fans are rarely wrong and SyFy (back then the SciFi Channel) realized that the novel deserved a more ""traditional"" approach in production value and, in 2000, released a three-part miniseries titled Frank Herbert's Dune.  On 07/08/2005, the miniseries enjoyed a box set DVD release with footage originally cut from the US broadcast, a whole host of extra features, and a freshly remastered 16x9 widescreen version of the film.  It is this DVD set that I am critiquing below.

To summarize the plot as thoroughly as a 544-page novel/ 300-minute film to a couple paragraphs can withstand, Dune tells the extensive tale of a desert wasteland planet called Arrakis; which happens to be the center of an intricate power struggle within an interstellar empire. See it turns out that Arrakis (commonly nicknamed `Dune') is the Universe's only known source of spice (called Melange in the book series, but unnamed in the film). Melange is no mere food seasoning however, and in fact is requisite for interstellar travel as well as grants psychic powers and increased lifespan to those who use it (indicated by pale glowing blue eyes).

The core of the tale centers on the political ripples put in motion when the Emperor assigns the noble House Atredides control of Arrakis. The former stewards, the Harkonnens, aren't exactly eager to hand over the rights, and through an elaborate plan of cunning and treachery, attempt to overthrow the honest Atreides clan.

The viewer essentially tags along with the Duke's teenage son Paul Atreides, who begins the story a spoiled noble, and ends up (along with his mother) stripped of everything but the clothes on their back and left to parish in the vast expanses of the desert.  Fate or predetermined destiny intervene and result in their taking up refuge with the believed to be barbaric natives of Arrakis, the nomadic Fremen tribe.

A sort of antihero theme, Paul may be the end result of a centuries-long genetic experiment designed to breed the perfect human specimen; his use of spice hints toward a much more important destiny: the one who will free the Fremen people from the empire's oppression.

Perhaps my summation appears ignorantly simplistic, in which case, rest assured much of the political strife and tension between noble Houses that makes the novel(s) so enduring has been retained in this, John Harrison's definitive take on the material.  In fact, much credit is due to Harrison's teleplay, which actually manages a very commendable job on delivering on the key themes of the book without falling victim to the ever-present risk of translating book dialog too directly (something Lynch's version is often criticized of).  It turns out that even the most perfectly written novels rarely translate to the screen on a word for word basis.

That said, the pacing and scale of Fran Herbert's rich universe are captured here surprisingly well.  The DVD set (wisely, in my opinion) retains the 3-part miniseries format; in this case each disc contains a roughly two-hour section of the film and a host of extra features (rather than say placing the film across the first two discs and devoting the third entirely to the bonus stuff).

And speaking of, the Frank Herbert's Dune Director's Cut box set contains a whole plethora of extras including: Newly remastered 16x9 widescreen print, director's cut with nearly 30 minutes of never-before-seen footage, ""Willis McNelly on Dune"" featurette: author of the Dune Encyclopedia gives insightful perspective on Dune and his longtime friend Frank Herbert, ""The Lure of Spice"" featurette: a behind-the-scenes look at the production of the film, ""The Color Wheel"" featurette: Lessons of Life and Light with master cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, ""Walking and Talking with John Harrison"": an exclusive interview with the writer-director of Frank Herbert's Dune, ""Defining the Messiah"" featurette: Talks with religious scholars, such as Rabbi Mordachai Finely, Elaine Pagels, Munir Shaikh, and Jungian psychologist Gabrielle Bodo, ""Science Future/Science Fiction"" featurette: Distinguished science fiction writers Harlan Ellison, Octavia Butler, Michael Cassutt and director John Harrison discuss with award-winning inventor Ray Kurzwell the emerging technological paradigm shift and the moral issues that surround it, moderated by Arthur Cover, ""The Cinematic Ideation of Frank Herbert's Dune"": essay by Vittorio Storaro, Cast & crew information, a photo gallery including stills and sketches from the film, Children of Dune sneak peek pre-production gallery.  Finally there is a commentary track with John Harrison and some of the film's production staff over each of the film's three parts.

Despite much to adore in this incarnation of the franchise, it is not without it's detractors.  In this case, and not unlike Lynch's version, the casting choices once again fall under scrutiny.  I suspect that much of this stems from the inherent risk associated with turning any well-known book into a visual affair as finding human actors to live up to the expectations within our collective imaginations is no easy task (Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings excepted).  Make no mistake; most of the cast here does an adequate job, especially considering the limitations that accompany a made-for-tv budget.

Additionally the special effects, though certainly passable, do look a bit dated when compared to today's standards.  Many of the areas where one would expect to find visual flaws (like the flying ""thopters"" and the massive sand worms) actually hold up quite well.  It is the small things like the desert mouse that inspires Paul's name that will have today's CG-addicted fans snickering.  However, in all, it is actually quite a small complaint due to the fact that the story itself is so strong.  This isn't a film that relies upon flashy visuals to get it's point across; in fact much of the plot's key moments take place indoors in palaces, massive dining rooms, within space craft and so on; all of which are finely portrayed.  Additionally, elements like the Guild Navigators are undeniably cool in their presentation (something that the book doesn't really dwell upon).

In all, a few peccadilloes notwithstanding, Frank Herbert's Dune represents a solid weekend's worth of quality science fiction entertainment.  In my opinion there is no sense in attempting to compare this incarnation to the David Lynch version in effort to establish superiority because, after all, that is a relative label.  They each bring a unique perspective to the table with this, the Harrison version, more thoroughly retaining the intricacies of the original book.  Fans and non-fans alike would do themselves a favor by actually picking up both versions for comparisons sake and determining which they more easily connected with for themselves.  Better still, slip the novel in your cart as well and prepare to become immersed in one of the richest science fiction universes of our time.",1271203200,,8059,5.197683397683398
1390886,4,B000053V8F,"Frank Herbert's Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Special Edition Director's Cut) (3-Disc DVD Set) is much better than the David Lynch Dune (Extended Edition). It's much longer and so it can actually develop the plot and characters. It also seems more accurate and faithful to the book (although admittedly I haven't scrutinized it in detail). I thought the acting was overall decent enough for a Sci-Fi Channel show. I actually like Alec Newman's portrayal of Paul. On the other hand, William Hurt as Duke Atreides was horrible - cold and boring. It's not A-list acting, but it gets the job done.

The real disappointment - and the reason I think this film only deserves 3.5 stars - is the special effects. The movie came out in 2003, long after computer generated graphics had advanced enough to create the wonderful creatures in The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Theatrical Editions) [Blu-ray] and Jurassic Park Adventure Pack (Jurassic Park/ The Lost World: Jurassic Park/ Jurassic Park III). But in Frank Herbert's Dune, so many of the settings and creatures look outright fake. It's actually kind of embarrassing to watch. The deserts look like painted canvases on a soundstage. It's a shame the producers didn't just invest a bit more money into the movie and make Dune adaptation that could last the ages. Instead, there's already talk of yet another film adaptation of Dune in the near future.",1270425600,,1414,4.966244725738397

1390888,5,B000053V8F,"Quite simply, The Dune Mini Series is the best ""movie"" version of the classic novel. I don't mean it's closer to the novel than the 1984 movie, both deviate from it in many ways, but because it's roughly 2 hours longer than the movie it explores in more detail many aspects of the story the 1984 movie either skips over or truncates. The mini-series, for example, devotes a lot more time to exploring the Fremen and the role their mysticism plays in the story. It's a more detailed telling of the story, one that feels more authentic. In going back to watch the movie after watching the mini series, the movie feels rushed and incomplete. Also, if you haven't read the Dune novel the movie will be a bit confusing in parts. The mini series is much better suited than the movie for those who haven't read the novel. I still enjoy the 1984 movie, but I prefer the mini-series when all is said and done.

One thing both the movie and the mini series did well was the casting. The actors selected in both versions did a good job of capturing the essence of the characters.

All in all, I highly recommend the mini series. Five stars!

I agree there are small issues here and there with costuming, and maybe some casting, but it really tells the tale.

1390893,2,B000053V8F,"Let me start off by putting this into perspective: I read the original Frank Herbert novel, and I greatly enjoyed it.  I agree that the David Lynch movie was a mess, but it was a thoroughly entertaining mess.  When I heard that there was a six hour miniseries out there that paid scrupulous attention to the book, I was excited.  I wanted another interpretation of the story, and a big epic miniseries would do the trick.

 I had a few serious, serious problems though.  Namely, these: the special effects are straight from the dime store, and the costumes occasionally verge into being outright absurd.  Alec Newman created, in my opinion, a thoroughly dislikable and unrelatable Paul Atreides, and to be honest I didn't like too many characters in this version.  It was all a bit rushed, and even with knowledge of the book I almost got lost.  And the filmmakers chose to enhance the storyline of Irulan in such a way that left me with a bad taste in my mouth at the end.

 First, the effects.  I don't quite know how to be diplomatic about this, so here goes: it looks like something a fourteen year old whiz kid geek put together with no budget and his father's computer.  The sand dunes of Arrakis look like a video game, as do the giant sandworms.  These are supposed to be terrifying, wondrous monsters, and that's not how they come across.  At best, they look like a Super Mario Bros monster, at worst they look like a scabby...well...part of the male anatomy.  With teeth.  Seriously, I just about lost it.  Must be seen to be believed.  Not sure I recommend you do that.  Also, the matte painting backgrounds of the desert...look like matte painting backgrounds of the desert.  If you wanted a planet entirely made up of matte painting backgrounds of the desert, this would be the place for you.

 Costumes are generally okay, really, just a few awkward pieces.  I'm sure Irulan's butterfly dress looked great on paper.  In reality, however, it's a different story.  The Fremen still suits, I have to say, look MUCH MUCH better in this version than they did in the David Lynch one.  These look like direct fashion descendents of the Arabs, a good choice.  Lynch's looked like a puffy body suit with a Groucho Marx mustache as a breathing tube.

 As for acting, I was pretty sure William Hurt was just going to phone it in for a paycheck, so I was pleasantly surprised when he made an effort.  He didn't go all `I am acting' here either, and that's a good choice.  His Leto was relatable, noble and interesting.  I also have to say that the actress who played Jessica was TERRIFIC.  She was both poised and restrained and emotional and vulnerable.  Then again, I'm pretty sure that Jessica is the most overall interesting character in the Dune story.

 Unfortunately, we have to get to their progeny now, and he's the weakest link.  I'm not sure what else Newman's done.  He's an attractive man, and I got the feeling while watching him that he's a good actor in other things.  I'm really not sure why this character failed on so many levels.  I've come to the conclusion that the writers, the director and the actor must all accept some share of blame.  In other words, no one person screwed this all up.  It was a team effort.

 Now don't get me wrong, I appreciate the fact that they tried to make Paul a little more, well, human at the start of things.  Okay, if by `human' we mean whiny little brat who has a chip on his shoulder about EVERYTHING, then yes, he is human.  The whining seriously got on my nerves after a while.  This guy pouted at EVERYBODY and everything. Also, I think they aged the character up for this show, so I wanted to tell him to move out of his parents' house and get a job or something.  You know something's not right when Paul Atreides, in line to the Duchy of wherever they are, eventual master of the universe, super being sounds like some spoiled brat who doesn't get to hang out with his buds on ski trip.  ""I don't wanna go to Arrakis!  I wanna go to Europe with Hank and Todd!  My life is soooo hard!""

  Look, I'm not kidding, it really feels like that.

 You'd think that when they get to Dune and everything explodes and he has to realize his destiny it'd get better.  Sadly, no.  He does a one eighty and becomes a cold, cold, merciless messiah of coldness and no mercy (and the occasional whine.)  Apart from his freaky powers of everything, it's hard to imagine people wanting to follow this guy, since he's kind of a jerk.  You have not seen anyone quite this devoid of charisma.  When he turns to his mother and basically scolds her for standing up for the BILLIONS that will die in his quest to install Fremen everything all over the universe, you wish she'd slap his face and send him to bed without supper.  He is that bratty.

 Note: I hadn't quite realized until I saw this that Paul would lead a campaign that would quash all rebellion everywhere and make everyone slaves to his will and his nationalized religion and his culture.  It kind of ends up feeling, with this actor at least, like it should be titled Hitler in Space.

 Second note: the whine really came back in that scene with his mother.  ""Moooom.  I wanna do genocide.  You can't stop me.  I do what I waaaaaant.""  God, I hated Newman so much in this role.

 Also, I'm not quite sure why they needed him to be this much of a jerk.  As most people know SMALL SPOILER NOW he has a son with his Fremen girlfriend, and the kid gets killed.  So he sees this in prophetic visions, and when the girl wakes up he greets her with sitting on the mat staring into space like a freak and intoning solemnly `our son is dead' or something to that effect.  Later, when the poor woman shows GENUINE EMOTION, WHY IS THAT SO HARD TO COME BY HERE about the poor dead kid, he basically gives her a hug and goes `There, there, we'll get you another one.""  THANKS, HONEY.  THANKS SO MUCH.  Between the brattiness and the `we'll get you one with spots next time' reaction he has to his child's death, if I were Chani, I'd do something that I'm not quite sure I can print here.  Let's just say it rhymes with Reeve his Glass.

 I found myself missing Kyle MacLachlan.  True, like Newman he was bland (I think that comes with the Paul Atreides territory, though.  It's one of those `I eat breakfast, I get a new power, everything I do is right' kind of roles.)  However, he was also likable, sympathetic, caring and had a kind of regal bearing that worked.  Newman is, like I said, that rich kid that you never liked in school because he had new trainers and would INSIST on telling you about them.

 Moving on, I had small issues with how fast things moved.  Like Kwisatz Haderach, or however you spell it.  It came and went so fast that it was like `He's a criss cross quichera, he's a bushy casserole, he's a bird, he's a plane,' `He's a WHAT?' `Look, moving on.'

 Last thing: the Irulan subplot.  If you've read the books, you know that Irulan is the princess Paul has to marry to solidify his claim to the throne.  She pops in at the tail end of Dune to have this happen, and then schemes through the second book until she has a change of heart.  She's SUPPOSED to start off as unlikable, spoiled, selfish and haughty with no real love for Paul until the very end.  That way, you feel for Chani the Fremen concubine, and you're happy Paul stays with her.  In the book, I was definitely more a Chani person.

 Here's the thing: they created a subplot for Irulan that portrayed her as clever, feeling, brave, a dutiful young woman trapped and used as a pawn, and in love with Paul.  I thought the actress who played her was wonderful, and I'm glad Irulan had something to do here.  But if you see her as all these excellent things, when she SPOILER ALERT BUT IF YOU'RE READING THIS I ASSUME YOU KNOW WHAT'S COMING marries Paul and he turns his back on her and goes to Chani all `ilu bb' you...sort of...feel horrible for her.  In the book, when Chani stands there all sad and thinks Paul will leave her for gorgeous princess woman, he affirms his love and you are happy for her.  Here, when you see what a good person Irulan is and he still treats her like crap, news flash, you don't like Chani so much anymore.  So the thing basically ends with Paul and Chani prancing off together and leaving Irulan in the dust to be treated like crap by everybody, and instead of feeling like `oh I am so happy for Paul and Chani, their love will endure', I was more like `well, you can both go f--- yourselves, how about that?'  And that's NOT how I want to feel after SIX HOURS of miniseries.

 Okay, bottom line is despite all my moaning this has some okay things.  It's faithful to the book if that's your bag, a few of the actors turn in really good performances, some of the sets and costumes are nice to look at.  But I just hated Newman as Paul, everything felt rushed, and I really, really, really did not like how they handled the Irulan character.  But that's my opinion.  If none of these things bother you, I'm sure you'll enjoy it.",1261526400,3,9039,4.393957703927493
1390894,3,B000053V8F,"The biggest complaint I have is that this version gives you no sense of place. Nothing tells you what Arrakis really feels like - how beautiful and horrifying it is, and what it means to be stuck in a place that lets only the fittest survive. The Fremen? Well, they look like just another tv-series-medieval-village-folk (ok, their eyes glow at night. Not that it makes sense...) instead of the tough, lean, skinny desert fanatics they're supposed to be. They're just not that serious (and overacting certainly doesn't help). That's the number one reason for me to still prefer the Lynch version. Unfortunately, there's more: both set design and CGI ranges from nice (Arrakeen, the Guild fleet) to mediocre (the desert storm looked really bad). And while this version sticks closely to the novel, some bad choices were made in showing the world at work (again, the filmmakers didn't ""get"" the concept of the Voice, and made the actors speak through a tube or something).
This said, there are things in John Harrison's Dune, that work. I actually liked most of the performances - including William Hurt (portraying a noble man dead tired from digging himself out of a hole), and even Alec Newman (annoying at first, inhuman at the end, just how it should be). And kudos to Karel Dobry (Kynes - this is a Fremen if I ever saw one), P.H.Moriarty (Halleck), and Saskia Reeves (Jessica - very effective as the ""moral center"" of the story).
Much has been said about the costume designs for the ""nobles"". Sure, they do look weird, but come on. They are supposed to look decadent and, above all, RICH. And they do.
As for filming it all in a studio - it surely adds to the problem I started the review with, but then again Vittorio Storaro made the most of it - as can be expected from an artist of this caliber. A well-deserved Emmy.
Final thought: Dune is obviously a tough one to film. This version, while more understandable than the Lynch one, presents it's own set of problems. I hope someone tries filming it again - and if You, the future director, are reading this - please, don't treat it like fantasy. It may have strange visions, and giant bugs, but it's Science Fiction.",1256688000,2,2175,4.666666666666667

1390899,1,B000053V8F,"Let's get this out of the way first: I'm a big fan of David Lynch's movie. Even if it made drastic changes and edits on the original story to fit it to a two hour film format, it ultimately managed to capture the feel of Frank Herbert's magnificent novel and convey the character's personalities effectively, while giving us Dune fans strong visual images to enjoy the saga. The miniseries, even if it follows the original story closer (thanks to it's four and a half hour length) ultimately falls flat, and it's nothing short of an embarrasment.
Without going into much detail, I'll list my ten reasons why Frank Herbert's Dune (The Miniseries) sucks:
1) Bad story pacing and slow editing.
2) Stiff, horrendous, wooden acting.
3) Atrocious casting overall, especially distracting in the case of Duke Leto, Jessica, Paul, Chani, Stillgar, Baron Harkonnen and Feyd.
4) An ugly production design that looks like a low budget distillation of Star Wars and Star Trek, instead of a medieval universe where religion and mind altering substances are more important than techonological advancement.
5) Laughable, ridiculous costumes.
6) Cheap special effects overtly dependent on barely average CGI.
7) The desert scenes were obviously filmed on a very small soundstage and look as fake as an old Dr. Who episode.
8) A completely superflous subplot involving princess Irulan.
9) Both mentat characters (Thufit and Piter) were grieveously underwritten, and their importance to the story was completely lost.
10)A lot of the actors had very thick accents which made their dialogue incomprehensible at times.
For a truly good Dune experience, read the novel and watch Lynch's feature, don't even waste your time on this disaster.",1248048000,4,1718,5.139285714285714
1390910,4,B000053V8F,"As a Dune newbie, I can't comment on how the movie relates to the book... but as for the content, the movie's political undertones were extremely disturbing. Frank Herbert is obviously making commentary on both the Soviet Union and the Middle East and Islamic Fundamentalism. Replace the Baron's Harkonnen family with Stalin's Soviet Union; the  Arrakis spice with Saudi Arabian oil; the Fremen ways with Islamic belief & Mideast tradition; and suddenly this is a very relevant political story.

Even though this happened well after the writing of Dune, the Afghan Mujaheddin Insurgency against the Soviets was scary relevant to this story... and it was almost like Frank was predicting the future. In this event, highly Islamic Afghan Mujaheddin, assisted and trained by foreign powers (US & Pakistan) helped defeat and drive out the Soviet Union from Afghanistan. Soon after, the whole Soviet regime crumbled and communism collapsed. Many Mujaheddin believed this happened all because of them and felt victory just like Paul's victory over the Harkonnen. The similarities are just way way too striking to ignore. From all the Fremen tradition, to the charismatic but brutal leaders, to the insurgent tactics, to the ""take no prisoners"" attitude of each side, to defeating a far superior power with God on their side, to the incredible sense of victory at the end, and even to the climate & geography... this story seems MORE relevant today than it was before.

All this is well and good except for one fact. Fanatical Islam is no longer fighting the Soviet Union... it is now fighting against the United States and most rational mid-easterners as well. This is what it must feel like for these people to be fighting a war with God on their side.",1246838400,,1747,4.9965635738831615
1390911,3,B000053V8F,"For those seeking a faithful representation of Frank Herbert's book, you need to look no further than this movie.  The book is followed about as closely as anyone has a right to expect when being translated into a movie.  The deviations it does take, while sometimes a bit baffling, do not serve to undermine the integrity of Herbert's work.  Of note concerning deviations from the book are the increased presence of Princess Irulan and a ""how could she know that at this time"" timing discrepancy.  To the former, the Princess is inserted in a number of places in the movie that she was never a part of in the book.  While this might appear concerning, the actual result doesn't yield anything that matters to the story.  The second timing issue is a bit more subtle.  There is a major revelation about blood lines that in the book is revealed quite early, but in this movie is not revealed until near the end.  As a result, Jessica's child has information that she shouldn't have based on this revised timeline.

Where the movie really falls down is in all other areas:

First, the acting ranges from passable to terrible and spends most of the time somewhere in between those.  There are scenes that come off like the actors were sitting at a rehearsal table reading lines and not actually acting them out. For the most part the lines were emotionless and gave the distinct impression that you were watching community theater (with apologies to those in community theater).  The Baron probably did the best job of the lot, but that really isn't saying much.  I do applaud him though for not being too over the top.  Paul's progression comes off a little like Luke Skywalker's progression in the Star Wars films.  This was not the feel I ever got while reading the book.  Overall the acting is distracting.

Second, the costumes are a near total disaster.  They were okay for the Fremen and Paul, but utterly preposterous for royalty and others.  The costumes were completely over the top channeling the worst late night burlesque/drag queen presentation one could possibly imagine.  Why do alien or future attire have to be so completely unwieldy and flamboyant?  If this weren't bad enough, there seemed hardly a scene not involving a costume change involving these people.  It was dizzying and cheapened the presentation considerably.  If someone happened into the room while you were watching this film, they may ask what this movie is trying to spoof.

Lastly, the set design was laughable at best.  I have seen it described as ""lavish"" and while this may be true, that fact alone does not make it believable.  Most scenes looked just like a movie set with obvious painted backgrounds.  Had a boom mic of presented itself I would not have been surprised.  The look of the film reminded me of 50's and 60's movies or TV.  The sets were on par with Star Trek..the original series.  Rocks looking like painted Styrofoam and such.  These sets could have also come directly from the 1956 movie, The Ten Commandments.  It is hard to imagine a modern production looking this cheap and cheesy.  Having said that, there were some pretty good flight sequences and I think the worms were done fairly well.  Other than those few moments, the set design was a travesty.

In summary, it is hard to imagine anyone watching this movie who has never read the book.  It is so cheap, cheesy, and weird that it would be tough to last 15 minutes unless you are one who likes spoof quality films.  Having read the book I was simply interested to see how things would play out on the screen.  That is the only way I can imagine one being able to watch this film in its entirety.",1244678400,,3661,4.6625

1390915,2,B000053V8F,"Perhaps it's just me, but when people are from the same place, should they not sound a little similar? Though a very ""international"" cast, the variety of accents adds to what at most times feels like an overblown, overacted production.

This is a shame because there is some talent on display and the dialogue in the Dune books is certainly ""act-able"". With names like William Hurt, Ian McNeice, Giancarlo Giannini and Uwe Ochsenknecht among the cast, this had potential to go far.

This is a very different production from the 1984 movie version. In some respects it's better. It certainly gives more time to what is an epic story and doesn't try to cram it into 2 hours. Yet it feels like badly-directed stage play at times with overdressed actors taking themselves too seriously.

I'm guessing that much of the budget went into the costuming of the actors. There are wardrobe changes galore and each outfit is more outlandish than the one before. There seems to be a fascination with attaching card rectangles to things...While the 1984 movie version has it's drawbacks, at least the Harkonnen were somewhat menacing - the ones in this production look like the Vatican guards.

Some of the exterior shots and special effects suffer from what made-for-TV movies tend to suffer from and that is the ""made-for-TV"" look. There are one or two scenes where the background is so obviously painted as to make the viewer wonder how on earth the scene  made it into the finished product.

For the uninitiated viewer, the story pretty much follows the book, taking care not to get too bogged down in the minutiae that could have made it a very painful experience to watch. You don't need to have read the book to ""get it"". The story of the fall of the House Atreides and the rise of House Harkonnen in the medieval-meets-science galaxy of the Cirrino is an interesting one and when you think about when it was written (mid 1960s), it's still surprisingly up-to-date.

Where the production really suffers, as I started out with, is the acting. Alec Newman, who plays Paul Atreides / Muad'Dib cannot act. Some of this may be the script or direction. Paul Atreides is a complicated person who in the course of the tale turns from boy into man into pseudo-messiah. Alec Newman plays the character one-dimensionally, at all times coming across as a spoiled rich kid who deserves the respect of all around him.

No amount of supporting acting can save this bad performance. William Hurt does a good job as Duke Atreides, but he is killed off too early in the story to save what goes downhill from there. Ian McNeice does a reasonable job holding up his end of the story as Baron Harkonnen, but the Shakespearean end of scene ""poetry"" is insane and completely out of place. Saskia Reeves as Jessica Atreides isn't a strong enough presence to carry off the role.

A major tangent from the book is the increased role of Princess Irulan from a peripheral narrator to full-blown part of the story. Her character is a Nancy Drew meets Princess Leia combination that doesn't really serve much purpose. What she ""uncovers"" we already know so there is little value added by her; time that might have been better spent on other things.

While Uwe Ochsenknecht is a good actor, a Fremen he is not. One person who fits the casting to a tee in looks and sound is PH Moriarty as Guerney Halleck. Moriarty looks like villain in real life and his accent is perfect (if you have seen ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", that's your accent and actor).

I think that the series would have been much better if Alec Newman had not been cast in the leading role. The rest of the cast could have been carried when they slipped. Instead they try to carry him and the effort fails.

I wish (again) they'd standardize accents. By all means use British for one thing and American for something else and generic ""European"" for yet another. But mixing them between what are very obvious dynastic families and different races doesn't help the parts cement to become a whole.

Oh - and why is it that producers / directors see ""desert"" or ""dunes"" (no pun intended) they immediately think ""this calls for Middle Eastern sounding music""?

With all that said, if you have nothing better to do over a couple of evenings and there's nothing on TV, then this may be worth some time. But if you have something better to do, don't let watching this miniseries take you away from that.",1240272000,,4434,4.675224646983312
1390916,2,B000053V8F,"Unlike some reviewers I love to see interpretations on both film and tv from a novel.  Alot of times the author is rarely consulted or gives in to the persuasion of ""Hollywood"" i.e. directors, producers, movie companies.  So being a person who has read the dune series many times over and found something new each time I read it both the miniseries and David Lynch film did a decent portrayal of the book.  By far the miniseries fell short with acting by the main cast that did not come close to the energy and emotion the book gives to the reader.  Did Harrison forget about the Fremen's living area underground in caves (sietches) carved out under the great sea of sand.  And the stillsuits did not cover anything that would protect them in the open desert.  Not too mention the extra time spent on the fight scenes should of had Fremen fighting the Sardukar hand-to-hand knife combat.  Alec Neuman was too old for the role of Paul Atreides as was Kyle Maclachlan but what can you expect of them when the character is so adult like and yet only 17 years old when he attains the throne as emperor of the known world.  The miniseries portrayal of Duke Leto Atreides was cold and limp in character, not nearly fierce enough for the character Frank Herbert layed out in his book.  The movie version was much more straight forward and believable even though the part was extremely short.  One of the major differences between the miniseries and film is continuity which the miniseries was able to pull off.  With more time and a longer time for the story to unfold Harrison was able to stay closer to the book, yet seemed to forget extremely important parts; red lips, living areas, the mysticism of the Fremen, very essential quotes or character developments.  I love to read ""Dune"" and the sequel/prequel books, but for a true version to come out I believe that to be in each reader's mind.",1240012800,,1889,4.589285714285714

You can read the book and have your own vision, accept David Lynch's vision, or accept the Sci-Fi Channels vision. They are not equal, and therefore no comparison is justified.

I must confess that I enjoy David Lynch's work. It is odd, awkward, strange, bizarre, etc., but so what. The fact that so many people are critical of Lynch maybe due to the fact that ... you are not imaginative enough. As I read the reviews, it seems that many like the mini-series due to the fact that it is ""more faithful"" to the book. So what? I want a different interpretation, a new vision, something creative, something imaginative ... or why not just stick with the book? I do not know of many people who have read ""the book"" and actually liked, or preferred  ""the movie"" -- and I mean this on as broad a scale as possible, not limited to Dune/Lynch. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory vs. Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, e.g., Gene Wilder Vs. Johnny Depp? Or the original Dahl novel? Depp is creepy & laughable, but a favorite of Tim Burton ... but I digress, it was blasphemous to remake this in the first place (Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka).

1390922,3,B000053V8F,"In many ways, this version of Dune is more faithful to the original source material than the David Lynch film, but ultimately it conveys less of the essence of Frank Herbert's epic science-fiction masterpiece.

This version of Dune is a noble effort, but budgetary constraints and some questionable casting decisions diminish it's overall quality. Specifically, the actors portraying the Baron Harkonnen, Princess Irulan and Lady Jessica are all well-chosen and play their roles well. On the other hand, those chosen for Duncan Idaho (arguably the most important character in the Dune mythos) and Stilgar are truly terrible. The actor portraying Paul is uneven in this performance - he is much better playing the older Paul than he is the younger. Chani is also somewhat lackluster, but ironically, this is relatively consistent with her portrayal in the original novel.

Budget-wise, it quickly becomes apparent that this project's ambition exceeded its resources. Recycled footage, unconvincing exterior sets and poor CGI compromise a great deal of the aesthetic. This is especially unfortunate in light of the exceptional costume and wardrobe design.

All in all, this is a worthy effort at capturing Dune, and it is worth picking up if you are a true fan who is able to let some drawbacks slide. It's good when you've exhausted all other Dune media and are still craving more.

1390926,4,B000053V8F,"The original cinematic Dune, while filled with big name actors and blessed with a big budget, was notable only for great sandworms. The acting was substandard, Kyle McLaughlin a disaster, and the Harkonnen clan portrayed as clowns.

The Sci-Fi channel miniseries, while certainly flawed, is superior in every respect. Even the special effects, while modest, are convincing and better yet do not get in the way of the plot.

The miniseries assumes some knowledge of the plot and characters, and is not always strictly true to the book, but is ultimately satisfying in it's overall effect. It is probably not possible to portray the book within the timeline of even a miniseries anyway, but this current effort still merits a passing grade.

The treatment of the messianic theme of Herbert's novel is much more effective and less over the top than the cinema version, and I think fulfills Herbert's intention of illustrating that a Warrior Messiah, while an understandable desire, is a flawed desire that ultimately leads to a worse situation than the original condition that begged for his presence in the first place.

The acting is uneven. John Hurt somewhat underplays the role of Baron Atreides, but to good effect. Alec Newman seems initially uncomfortable as Paul Atreides, but grows into the role, and by the middle part of the film, is a real force. He is at his best when being nasty. Ian McNiece is the perfect Baron Harkonnen. Charming, intelligent, and utterly evil, unlike the Bozo the Clown offering of the theatrical version. Matt Keeslar is suitably arrogant and self-serving as Feyd Harkonnen, and Giancarlo Giannini an effectively charming but dangerous Emperor Shaddam IV.

But in fact, the current Dune is really a showcase for the talents of Julie Cox, who steals the show with one of the most masterful performances I've ever seen on film. Through her thespian skills and elegant demeanor, she quite incredibly becomes the central character of the story. I'd buy this version for her performance alone.

Even the native Arrackian inhabitants known as the Fremen are more or less human, having been descended from religious settlers who travelled to the planet long ago.

All-in-all, this movie is a fantastic production of Dune. Every Herbert reader should watch this and also its sequel, Children of Dune. Most unfortunately, these two films only occupy a relatively small time span within the Herbert's entire literary Duniverse, focusing mostly upon the legacy of Duke Leto Atreides, his son Paul, Paul's son Leto II. The films do not even touch upon much of the overall Dune saga, and could never possibly begin to go in-depth on the saga's rich prehistory including the beginnings of the Cymek invasion and the Butlerian Jihad.

I'm actually proud of myself that I made it through all the way to the end - in the same way that I'm proud of myself whenever I clean the bathroom, or take a particularly lengthy poop. Frankly, I think I deserve a medal.

Just by way of contrast, the David Lynch film was interesting, unusual and daring. I'm not sure it was actually any good, but it was a appreciably strong attempt. It had a few issues - an incomprehensible plot, a painful performance for Paul Atreides and sweet God - Sting?! - but it was a gutsy try at doing credit to the book.

This series managed not only to avoid to keep these same flaws, but also find a few dozen new ones to throw into the mix.

The leads were all just... not very good. In some cases, the casting ranged all the way to the outright terrible. If ""Dune"" was supposed to be a credible attempt at the book, there were a couple things that slipped by entirely. Paul, for example, is young. And Bene Gesserit just don't cry. Ever. Jessica should not be portrayed by a sniveling, doe-eyed woman, who alternate bawls with tears and loses her temper. Even more shockingly, she's clearly afraid most of the time - which is, for fans of the book, a serious breach of the ethos.

The special effects were terrible - a flying leap backwards from the Lynch film. Most shots looked like they were taken in front of oversized stills from the original movie, and the desert scenes were straight out of 'King Solomon's Mines'.

The plot, as I mentioned, was still incomprehensible. In a bid for legitimacy, lots of minor-but-authentic (Fenring) characters were added in an attempt to counterbalance the butchery of the major ones. But if you're going to introduce the many thousands of factions of Herbert's universe, you've actually got to provide a little more background - and that's not just one badly animated Man-bat scene for the Guild. The Bene Gesserit were equally ridiculous, looking like Cirque du Soleil rejects, as they wandered around aimlessly.(Crying and being afraid... did anyone read the book?!).",1210896000,4,2107,4.7146739130434785

1390934,4,B000053V8F,"One of the most popular science fiction novels of all time gets a good four hour adaptation in what I would probably categorize as the Sci-Fi Channel's greatest mini-series aside from the new Battlestar Galactica. This film includes elements of both good movie making and a good stage production. Plenty of people wish to compare the mini-series with the movie that was made in the 80's. To me it's ultimately like comparing apples and oranges as you are looking at two very different formats. While I won't say either is better than the other I will say Frank Herbert's Dune is a triumph of television.

Like all adaptations there is always a fine line to walk between literary accuracy and the time constraints and format difference a television film gives. You can be rest assured it's essentially as true to the spirit of the book as you can expect. The story seems to take dual roles with a focus on the political maneuvering as well as the struggle of a partisan revolution. While the script is very well written on many aspects there were some details that I felt were more taken for granted than they should. I can't help but feel the mini-series was made for people who read the book with some of the assumptions that were made in small plot points and details.

Technically the show is beautiful, especially considering the budget they had to work with. The costumes were great as well as the sets. Though you can notice a few sets were not much more than a painted stage I actually liked how they executed those and enjoyed the theatrical charm it lent to the production. CG animations and designs are very impressive. I love the ornithopters and other ships. I will admit that I prefer the design of the worms from the original movie more than the new ones... just my preference. The action is a mixed back with one on one fights looking awesome especially with that weirding way effect, but the choreograph on the big major battles is lacking and seem more like a stage production than a film.

The acting it top notch in a theatrical sense, but not always in a movie sense. You will catch some melodrama here and there, but nothing to really damage the pace of the series. Interestingly enough I do have to compare the interpretation of two pivotal characters here. I like the way Baron Harkonnen is portrayed in the mini-series as a much more intelligent and dynamic character than the disgusting villain in the movie version, however I find myself liking the Paul Atreidis character less in this production. I'm not saying Alec Newman did a bad job because he was great. Just the concept of the character didn't fit the ""Prince of House Atreidis"" mold and didn't feel as inspiring is all.

Frank Herbert's Dune is definitely a mini-series for fans of Frank Herbert's books. Those of you unfamiliar with his works shouldn't fret too much. Even though some aspects might not be clear to you that shouldn't stop you from enjoying the mini-series by the time you finish it. It's definitely a very conceptual work and I encourage any sci-fi fan out there who likes more than just Star Wars and Star Trek styled space operas to give it a look.",1204070400,,3153,4.635062611806798
1390935,2,B000053V8F,"I feel that this work gets good reviews mainly because it's compared to David Lynch's version, and hence most feel that it follows the plot of the original book more closely.  While I agree, I definately disagree that it is a better movie.  Also, you should be forewarned that this version deviates significantly from the novel in several places and overall, It seems to me to deviate significantly from the spirit of Herbert's novel.

Make no mistake, this is a ""made for TV movie"", so you get everything that goes along with that; sub-par acting, poor directing, badly choreographed fights, and in this instance, something filmed completely in the dry, artificial environment of a studio.  Some of the sets and lighting are actually quite good, some are actually quite bad.  Some of the special effects are good, some aren't.  Some of the costumes are very nice, most are really bad.  Sometimes, I couldn't help thinking how great it would have been had George Lucas been there to rub some dirt on some of the Fremen's nice clothes.

One of my biggest complaints with this miniseries is that it really utterly fails to portray the sense of restriction that the climate of Arrakis enforces upon it's inhabitants.  The only hint of this is in the Fremen's red-neck looking, deer-hunter stillsuits.  Air seals are not shown in any of the Fremen caves or around the palace at Arakkeen.  In fact, the Fremen are shown throughout frolicking in the open air of the desert without stillsuits.  The sietches themselves seem to be completely open to the desert.  More importantly, the psychological effect of this restriction is not played-up well in the movie.

My second biggest complaint is that the miniseries completely fails to portray the ""terrible purpose"" of the Lisan al-Gaib and the transformation that occurs to Paul Atreides with any convincing force.  The inner psychology of the novel is almost completely absent.  The subtle, almost paranoid interactions of some of the characters are not portrayed and several of the most powerful scenes from the book are skipped over.  For instance, the interaction between the Lady Jessica and Thufir Hawat when he confronts her in the palace in the belief that she is the traitor.  Its an incredible scene in the novel when Thufir finally realizes the inconcievable (to a mentat) power of the Bene Gesserit.  It also serves to heighten the sense of paranoia that was taking place within the Atreides house.

Also missing is the climax of the end of the first book, where Paul and his mother have escaped to the desert and in their stilltent, Paul realizes what he is, what it is that his destiny is moving towards, becomes something different than what he was before his father was killed and their house dispersed and in so doing both frightens and accuses his mother.

The climax of the second book is trivialized as some sort of Fremen orgy.  I was completely disgusted by the carnal (as opposed to carnival) portrayal of the ritual of the drinking of the waters of life.  Paul and the fremen are never even shown taking the changed waters.  Suddenly everyone is humping somebody and Paul and Chani are laying in bed somewhere having some pillow talk.

I sincerely hope that a gifted director comes along to make a movie version of the book that stays more true to the inner workings of this incredible novel.  In the meantime, I suggest that you save the four and a half hours and few extra dollars that you would've wasted on this movie and invest them instead into buying and reading the orignal paperback.  There still isn't anything that compares to it.",1203379200,5,3607,4.813311688311688
1390936,1,B000053V8F,"I have to say up front, I am utterly disappointed.  I had very tolerant expectations of the Sci Fi Miniseries - Dune.  I wonder if the creators of the show actually read the book a few times before making the movie.  I am not sure who is to blame, the director, producer, or the writers, but this was a sad attempt at adaptation of Dune.

It struck me that many of the key portions that build the story and the character Paul Atridies throughout the book are skipped, rewritten or ignored.  As a small example, when Liet inspected the stillsuits of Leto and Paul, there were significant portions of the dialogue that could have been taken verbatim from the book without extending the script and invested into the movie the depth of the legends and mystery around Paul; rather this director diminished it.  Liet reminded me of Dr. Who versus someone that was Fremen.  Moreover, while Alec Newman may be a superb actor, it appears that he was directed to portray his character as a combination of a simpering brat that was more of a camp follower who eventually progressed into the karate kid in the end.  The set was fair and no complaints for the budget they were on, its an outstanding job.  It did strike me as being rather sterile though.  For a giant, dusty planet, nobody was dirty or dusty it seemed.  Bottom line - save your money and don't buy this one.",1202169600,5,1361,4.491869918699187
1390937,5,B000053V8F,"This adaption of Dune does take quite a few liberties with Herbert's masterpiece, but it saves the essence of the book. Sci-Fi's minni series is long but entertaining.

1390938,3,B000053V8F,"I read the book & saw both this version & the Lynch version.
I laud the Sci Fi channel to have the bravery to put the budget into making this movie, but its a shame that this production is marked with such wooden acting.  Its strange and parallels the problems with the Star Wars Prequels--some of the actors in this production have been in several other movies, but showed excellent acting in those productions, not this one.  This movie should've been incredible, but the acting only makes it mediocre.
The script is excellent.  Its what all the Dune fans wish the Lynch movie could've been.  Unfortunately Lynch had to present Dune in a movie about 2 hrs.  This movie should've only been made in a series format because faitfully converting Dune requires is be much longer than 2 hrs.
However that's where the excellence ends & the mediocrity begins.  The acting is not good.  Its not even average.  I have seen sitcoms with better acting.  Most of the actors seem emotionally detached, & there are long pauses between some of the dialogue.  The timing added a level of boredom on top of the flat acting.  Some of the other reviewers have defended this claiming that the characters in Dune show hyper discipline.  I disagree.  Even the Harkonnens who are supposed to be over emotional & undisciplined seemed detached.  Yes-they'll grunt & yell now & then but it doesn't seem like its real.  It seems scripted & unpassionate.
The effects, sets, costumes--they also seem uninspired.  This is perhaps something unavoidable given the budget.  They don't look cheap.  They just aren't as good as audiences today expect from sci fi productions.  The entire movie, it feels like its on a set, being filmed instead of making you feel this is real.  The Lynch movie despite being years older had better production in this area.
Overall, I'm glad someone tried to faithfully convert the book into a movie, but this conversion, while brave & not bad, isn't very good either.  It gets quite boring at times due to the poor acting.",1198886400,,2021,4.75
1390939,4,B000053V8F,"Frank Herbert's text has always been very dense, and after watching the Movie, Dune, it was an open question in my mind as to whether it could actually be accomplished.  They story for certain could not be told in two or three hours and a mini-series was exactly what was needed.

The writing and the acting were dead-on in this adaption, and I especially appreciated the rhyming Shakespearean couplets that the Baron Harkonen was apt to throw in at the end of his scene.  Nice touch, that.  The set design was a bit lacking here and there and I would especially note the early Dr. Who-ishness of some of the sets.  Most of it was just fine, though, and there were very few scenes where I thought the actors might step through the background.

One quick note about the acting:  What is it with British Actors and the spitting?  Emoting is fine, but say it, don't spray it.  That aside, it was all well done.

Another, perhaps petty squabble, was with the costumes -- too many silly hats!  Every single character seemed to sport one of these bizarre chapeaus.  Enough!  In the world of the future I believe that everyone will wear sensible headwear.

All in all, good series, fairly well done and true as possible to the source material.",1198454400,,1236,4.5590909090909095

1390953,3,B000053V8F,"Well, so here's another attempt at ""Dune;"" a book that's probably consider to be one of the best Sci-fi ever written - even without its sequels. So, why is it that with such great material in hand, the adaptions have fallen so short?

David Lynch, who in my opinion, is a great director and visionaire, did his version of ""Dune"" in the 1980's; unfortunately it wasn't one of his best work (although I have heard that the real culprit might have been Dino De Laurentiis; the producer of the film, aka director of Flash Gordon). Lynch's ""Dune"" was a bit on the weird side (not surprising), and the entire film was difficult to comprehend for viewers who are not already familar with the story and its characters. Thankfully, Sci-Fi channel's ""Dune"" somewhat fixed this problem.

Sci-Fi channel's version of ""Dune"" added dialogues and scenes to make the story more coherent to any newcomer. So, I think most people should be able to follow the progression. In fact, if you never read the book, you might even think these minseries are pretty good. The special effects are on par with what you would expect from a made-for-tv movie. The actors do a decent enough job, so nothing seems too cheesy. And since this version follows the original book fairly close, if you're a sci-fi fan, it should definitely be interesting.

However, one problem does arise from these sands of ""Dune."" The casting. The casting sucked. I'm sorry, but William Hurt does not even remotely resemble Leto Atreides. Alec Newman doesn't look like Paul, and Thuir Hawat seems wrong (where are the wrinkles), so does Duncan Idaho, Dr. Yueh, etc. Some people might says this is not a big deal, but you know what? I had to sit through 6 hours, watching a blonde Paul Atreides. They could of just dyed his hair black.

Anyways, other than that, this series was fairly enjoyable, but the casting just made it less engaging for a ""Dune"" fan like me.",1194912000,,1911,4.695522388059701

1390958,4,B000053V8F,"I read the novel when it first appeared back in the `70s, and I saw the originally movie when it came out in 1984. You're not supposed to buck the critics, but I rather enjoyed David Lynch's film, even with its obvious shortcomings. (But then, I'm a Lynch fan.) Its biggest problem, to my mind, was the inability of any screenwriter or director to cram all the major themes and characters of the book into a two-hour flick, which greatly confused viewers. This miniseries solves that problem up front by running four-and-a-half hours -- lots of time to explicate what Frank Herbert had to say. Even so, this being a visual medium, the emphasis is on the revolt of the Fremen against the Harkonnen, as led by Paul Atreides, a/k/a Muad'Dib. Only William Hurt among the cast is very well known, and he played the duke as a very downbeat character. But the duke's character is much better developed. P. H. Moriarty's portrayal of Gurney Halleck (an ex-slave, don't forget) is much truer to the book's character than Patrick Stewart's boy scout impersonation in the original movie. On the other hand, Linda Hunt was a much more impressive Shadout Mapes in the original. Ian McNiece provided a nice over-the-top rendition of the Baron -- very similar, actually, to Kenneth McMillan's version in the movie. The sets were gorgeous, the effects were . . . well, . . . adequate, and the costumes varied between interesting (the stillsuited Fremen and the cavalier Saudaukar) and laughable (the Bene Gesserit's Easter bonnets). Well, fans will argue the two versions, and both versions against the book, for some time to come. But the miniseries is very much worth watching.",1188864000,2,1663,4.838596491228071

This 2000 attempt from the Sci-Fi Channel comes closer, though it still falls short. There are many themes and characters in the book that would have to be sacrificed in a shorter treatment that are given their due here. And even minor characters are fleshed out more fully here than in Lynch's version. On the other hand, many details are changed from the book for no apparent reason. The cast does a fair job--no one actor is outstanding, but all do their job in a way that leaves the viewer free to focus on the story. Alec Newman is not as convincing in the role of Paul as Kyle MacLachlan in Lynch's version, and William Hurt is a puzzling choice for Duke Leto; but P.H. Moriarty fits my vision of Gurney perfectly and Barbora Kodetov&aacute; is bewitching as Chani. The special effects are below industry standard, but given that the story is the point of the movie, that's not a big concern. Unfortunately, while the movie is a reasonable first approximation to the book, the DVD release wastes an opportunity to enrich our experience: there are many ""extras"", but only a few are worth watching.

By comparing this 2000 release to Masterpiece Theater I refer to the similarities in the way all those classic British novels receive a chapter by chapter breakdown and re-telling on Masterpiece Theater, and the way Dune was unveiled in exactly that detailed format. But I'm saying this in a good way and I'm glad Dune was handled as it was. I have always really enjoyed this re-telling of Frank Herbert's novel, and feel the way it layered its storylines to create depth was admirably reverential. This is a no frills, no superstars production that puts the plot ahead of all else, and as a result this version of Dune is all the better for it. In fact ""balanced"" is a nice way to describe the final product of this movie: performances, special effects, scenery, story, it all came together very nicely, and I was and am impressed by the result.

It keeps pace is scope and grandeur with its cousin.

It has been lavishly produced and the actors, although only a few truly known, just like William Hurt, do their jobs with dignity and are very believable in their respective roles.

Some special effects were even taken over from the theatrical movie, such as the Sand Worms on Arrakis (the Dune Planet), which were made in both cases by creature designer Carlo Rambaldi. Only this time, they truly come alive and are really menacing.

Even the music, although more Earthbound, and ""orientally"" exotic, seems to work when compared to Toto and Brian Eno's music score of the theatrical movie.

Everything seems to come alive and even though some artistic license has been taken with Frank Herbert's novel, this is probably one of its best transliterations to date.

The transfer on DVD is very well done and presented in a matted 1.78:1 image ratio and is compatible with 16:9 TV sets. The sound is clear and polished. You can understand the dialogue clearly, even during explosions or other sound effects taking place.

1390980,5,B000053V8F,"I'll start by saying I love this series, and still enjoy it upon every re-watch.

Herbert had so many excellent ideas compounded into his first Dune book, which is about...Dune, a desert planet that has no worth except for being the only source of the 'Spice' needed by the Navigators. The Navigators guide the space ships, and thus are essential to trade and communication. Because the Spice is such a valuable commodity, people are constantly vying for the governing spot on the planet. The Emperor, the overall ruler, decides the Baron Harkonnen and family aren't fit for this spot, so he kicks them off and places the well-respected Duke Atreides there. His son, Paul Atreides, falls into place as the 'Messiah' of the natives, and becomes part of a political adventure that draws nobles, the Emperor, and worms alike.

The acting is excellent. I felt William Hurt to be somewhat dry in his role as Paul's father the Duke, but I thought he was respectable and serious enough that it fit well. Paul's actor was stoney the entire time, which although is a little odd at first, made his character stand out. Sometimes it seemed he should have cared more, but overall I liked him in the part. My favorite picks for actors were those who played the Fremen, the natives, because of their beautiful accents. They fit the part of a mysterious people superbly. The only actor I was disappointed in was the one who played Yueh. I think in the old Dune movie Yueh got more of an appearance, and I feel in the miniseries he just didn't get a big enough of a part considering the impact of the actions of his character. His emotions also didn't impress me.

As for effects and costumes, and overall cinematography, I never had to think about them much because they were great. I really liked the costumes, and think the Bene Gesserit's imposing and odd enough to fit their character.

I not only enjoyed this when I first watched it, but have continued to enjoy it since. I highly recommend it to science fiction & fantasy fans, and as well to those who enjoy an inventive and brilliant story.

The sequel miniseries doesn't match up to this one, but if you enjoy Dune, don't forget to see it.

Lastly, a short comparison of the movie, the book, and the mini-series:
I saw the movie first of the three, and was not impressed. I saw it again after reading the books and it wasn't as bad, but this miniseries is many times better -- and not only because it had more time to fit in all those elements missing from the more time-constrained movie.
Compared to the book the mini-series leaves a lot of things out, some of which I miss, but with the time given they did an excellent job in narrowing the content. I get the feeling they tried to make the series more romantic than the books, but they certainly didn't do it poorly. Story adaptation: excellent. (Compared to many other adaptations? Beyond excellent.)

1390986,1,B000053V8F,"Ok, ok... it has been years since I first saw this mini-series. Now, from the 1984 version, I didn't stick around for everything, but I did see enough of the key parts to know that I liked the movie (acting, actors, costumes, music, effects, etc). However, when I first saw the mini-series on the Sci-Fi channel oh so many years ago, I first tried to enjoy it, despite the stark contrasts between the 1984 version and this. Then, thigns started to get on my nerves, here are the following:

#1: I understand that the costumes were supposed to be futuristic (and in some cases aristocratic), but a GREAT deal of the costumes just registered ""a drunk flamer during Marti Gras made these gaudy, ugly, and, in some cases, overtly femine/showing off too much, costumes."" vibe to me. Give me fucntional, durable, and practical.

#2: Give me my deformed Harkonnen, compared to this fat, floating, foppish fool! I'm sorry, but the techy Harkonnen from the 1984 version will always be my bad guy: Ugly, dark clothing, a face covered in sores, and just this intimidating air amongst him! The mini-series Harkonnen reminded me of a versy disturbing cross between John Goodman, and Dr. Robotnik. Not intimidating or impresive at all.

#3: The visual graphics did leave a lot to be desired.

#4: TOO... MUCH... TALKING!!! I almost fell asleep becuase I was watching too many characters talk and talk and talk about things I could care less about. I think it was up to the part when Paul Atreides was mocking Baron Harkonnen by calling him ""Baron Hog"", or something like that, when I finally realized... this mini-series is far too boring for my tastes!

Other than that.. yeah the acting left a lot to be deisred, as well as taking some of the characters unfamiliar directions, and as for an ""all-star cast"", tch yeah... I didn't recognize ANYBODY. Give me Kyle MacLachlan, Kenneth McMillan, Patrick Stewart and Sting, anyday.

In short, visually disturbing (costumes), performingly boring (acting and too much talking about nothing), and just simply not something that said, ""I'm an awesome retelling of a book."".

And what about the 'Director's cut'. Well it's actually the same as the dvd version you could buy in The Netherlands, but there is one big advantage. This US version has a very interesting commentary track and a lot of specials that inform you about the production. The special about the translites is the most interesting.

Even though they take a couple of liberties with the text themselves, the shear scope and breadth in which they covered the first book is just well done.

Duncan dies in Stiecth Tabr holding Sardukar so Paul and J and Kynes can get away, not in the Atreides stonghold or desert. Perhaps you are thinking of Kynes death. Paul starts strong in the story ""gom jabbar episode sp?"" and only gets stronger, till he is ruler of the universe at about 20. This guy is BAD and he knows it but can do nothing about it, he truly wants to avoid the jihad he is fomenting.

Feyd is scheemer and a formidable fighter as he shows occasionally. Rain!? at the end of lynch's? movie, whatever. The fremen are the greatest warriors of all time apparently and take over the univerce in a decade or so just to prove it, so again they are mistreated in the t.v. show and THE WEIRDING MODULES? in Lynches' film?

Yes, the Baron was at one time more like Feyd, hard and muscular, till the B.G. forced him to sleep with Gaius Mohiam, He wasn't amused and raped her so she gave him a wasting disease ( the B.G. can do all sorts of nasty things with their bodies and metabolism at a moments notice) which turned him into a bloated toad of a man.

Of course I watched it anyway, just because it was Dune . . . and then, slowly, incredibly, I watched in disbelief as somebody, finally, carefully, made an credible portrayal of the Dune Universe -- on TV.

I couldn't believe it: A certain character dies as he was meant to die, sacrificing himself at a Fremen sietch to give Paul and Jessica a chance to escape (though he does not get a chance to show his fighting skill.) The multiple plots are actually explained without resorting to soap operaish internal dialog.

Were the costumes what I imagined? No. Were the special effects perfect? No. Was each character what he should have been? NOT; but, most were pretty darn good (the blue within blue eyes were perfect) and the portrayal of the overall story is a good one. The ideas from the novel -- scarce commodities and the blood we pour out for them; beloved yet psychotic rulers; plans within plans, within plans -- come through in ways that never happened with the Lynch effort for all its gore and narcissism.

I finished this series with the utmost respect for the effort put forth by it creators, given the medium, and I say that as someone who has admired the series for three decades and read it at least a half dozen times, plus all the later works, both by Herbert and his son.

And it is said that he will be coming from the Iraqe reagion. I'm not sure if he paying homage to our theory or making fun of it. They even had an 'Athan' *Islamic Prayer Call* in one of the scenes.

That in its self grabbed my attention and see how Mr. Herbert took that and turned it into a sci-fi extravagansa.

 Also I very much enjoyed the Lighting, and the sets were very beautiful to look at.

The Graphics were good at times and silly at other times, but I was willing to look beyond that and just enjoy the desert people with blue glowing eyes.

You get 3 DVDs, and I liked the fact that each DVD ends with a little narration and it fades to black and then you get the message to insert the second disk. Also in each disk there are several features, I just haven't explored them yet.

None of the Fremen come off as rough hardcore people of the desert, more like extras from an Indiana Jones movie.

The stillsuits look stupid.  Like they took pajamas and drew some tubes on.

In about 90% of the scenes its painfully obvious that they have a poorly painted backdrop.  The desert scenes were the worst.  What is supposed to look like an expansive desert vista is so badly painted you cant help but see a 2d backdrop.

Why in the world did they throw in some random made up storyline with Irulan?

Second, putting the DeLaurentiis family in charge of production was the kiss of death. Third, several reviewers have wondered where the ""weirding weapons"" were.

That said, I was very happy with this adaptation-- much more so than Lynch's mess. Although MacLachlan appears closer to the description of Paul in the book than Newman, Newman handles the role better. The casting is superior to the movie, and at the very least because NO Sting (a terrible, terrible actor).

This miniseries was the way Dune should have been handled all along-- breaking down one of the most complex sci-fi works ever into multiple episodes.

1391022,3,B000053V8F,"As both a fan of Frank Herbert's novel ""Dune"" and of David Lynch's work, I enjoyed the 1984 adaptation of ""Dune"".  When I was younger, I enjoyed this mini-series far more, but having re-watched it over the last few nights, I find that this adaptation is far more flawed than I recalled.

The major flaws of this mini-series are weak performances by the actors, poor directing, and some less than amazing special effects (not to mention some unusual costume design).  The performances in this, combined with the often dull cinematography, made me feel more like I was watching a play than an epic mini-series.  The worst performance came from William Hurt, who seems as though he may fall asleep at any moment.  Matt Keeslar makes a very weak Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen when compared with Sting's portrayal from the 1984 film.  There are some good performances, though.  Ian McNeice is terrific and often funny as the scheming Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.  Saskia Reeves brings some life to the character of Jessica Atreides.  P.H. Moriarty is great as Gurney Halleck, as is Karel Dobry as Dr. Kynes.

John Harrison, a former music video director, takes 265 minutes to (loosely) adapt Frank Herbert's novel to the small screen, and even then cannot capture the brilliance of Herbert's work.  Most of the time the actors seem to have little clue what they should be doing.  Most of the events depicted in the novel occur in the film, however they are often out of order.

The production design for the film is colorful, but perhaps a little too much so.  The costume design is at once creative and perhaps a little silly.  The special effects are often weak, though the sandworm effects turned out rather well.  It's obvious that this was filmed on a stage rather than on location (you can tell that the background is made up of matte paintings).

Graeme Revell's score is very good, though occasionally I thought I heard tunes borrowed from Toto's score for the '84 movie.

This mini-series is at times dull, and at a few occasions very good, but all in all it fails to successfully adapt Frank Herbert's novel for the small screen.  Interestingly, it helps accentuate the good points of David Lynch's adaptation, which I must say that I prefer to this.  Fans of ""Dune"" should certainly check this out; I leave it up to them to decide which version they prefer.

(NOTE: Originally the mini-series included 30 more minutes of footage.  This was released on a 3-disc ""Director's Cut"" DVD.  I have yet to see this.  It is likely better than the version I have reviewed above.)",1140739200,,2564,4.775

 capture the ssence of Dune in a movie, but this is

 probably the best attempt I've seen.  I still LOVE

 Lynch's version, because I am a huge David Lynch

 fan anyways and he can add an element of magic,

 psychadelia, and darkness that I feel is absolutely

 mandatory in a Dune movie-- and somewhat lacking in the

 Sci-Fi versions.  Still, I have to credit the Sci-Fi

 version for pulling things -directly- from the book,

 the transfer from book to screenplay was excellent.

 Basically Lynch's has: Magic, morbid curiousity,

 psychadelic visions and the best depiction ever of

 capturing the spice trances.  Basically, Ambiance.

 The Sci versions: more directly taken from the novels,

 more ""true to the story"", but some overall average

 acting took away from this a bit.  Strangely enough

Obviously the book is much more comprehensive and rewarding, but this production certainly attempts to address some of the depth intended by the author. The problem with any of these sophisticated novels is how to translate it into an abridged film production, keep the narrative moving, and satisfy all of those bookworm SciFi gurus who expect every detail to be in order. There's also the problem of creating a production that only the book readers will understand. There are some parts of this film where I feel this is true, but in general, I enjoyed this offering.  The ""worm"" and general settings are somewhat realistic and the special effects are adequate. I highly recommend the Director's Cut version with the additional footage. I found the extra 30 minutes or so to be relevant, and the special features give a credible insight into the production of the film, director's vision, and treatment.

1391027,4,B000053V8F,"At 295 minutes across 3 DVDs I expected this Director's Cut to provide three evenings of entertainment, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself eagerly loading one disc after another. With much more screen time than the Lynch movie, this Sci-Fi Channel production has ample time for character development and clear plotlines: the complexities of the Dune universe become an asset to the story rather than an impediment, as they should be.

This mini-series' TV origins are evident in the sub-Playstation special effects, but the production uses its money where it counts most, in splendid sets and costumes. Apart from the stars, the cast are mostly East European character actors and their accents lend a nice sense of exoticism. Of course, the mini-series lacks the sheer visual splendour of David Lynch's flawed masterpiece, but it does explore the undercurrent of religious fanaticism on Dune much more effectively. Alec Newman, as Paul Atreides, also convinces on his journey from threatened fugitive to demi-god of the known universe.

Of course, there are the inevitable irritations. This version's cockney septuagenarian Gurney Halleck is no match for Patrick Stewart's wonderful grizzled warrior/poet. But then, we don't have to put up with Sting as Feyd Rautha. Sometimes the costumer veers too close to an Aladdin Christmas panto, and the stillsuits, so gorgeously flattering in the Lynch film, are simply rubbish. But the advantage of this version is that you can watch it with Dune newbies instead of the Lynch version knowing you won't have to be explaining what the devil is going on every 15 minutes.

No version of a book as complex as Dune will ever be perfect, not even in that alternate universe where Lynch's original 5hr 40min cut still exists. But this series is the most coherent and intelligible version we have. I ordered the sequel immediately.",1133222400,3,1877,5.127450980392157
1391028,3,B000053V8F,"Something that many reviewers do is sit and compare this to the Lynch version of Dune.  While this may be fun to do, just because the miniseries was purer than the Lynch film by no means makes it a better film.  You judge a film on its own merits.  Lynch was going for something much different than a pure adaptation of the book, he was telling his own story in the Dune universe, and I can respect that.

That being said, there were aspects of the miniseries I both loved and hated.  The miniseries was priding itself on being a pure adaptation of the book.  Well, the first ten minutes disappointed me greatly, and I'm glad it got better as it went along.  My main disputes are with the characters themselves, not the events which took place.

To begin with, the characterization of Paul was incredibly poorly done.  From the very beginning he seems to have strength and power which rivals all around him, including Gaius Helen Mohiam.  His fight with Gurney made Gurney out to be a decrepit old man, and he treated him with no respect.  When Paul was ever shown up he acted like a petulant child.  I do not feel that the early portrayal lived up to what we should come to expect from the novel.

I found the Harkonnen crew to be incredibly amusing and fun to watch, although a bit lighter than I would have liked them to be (as far as mood goes).  The only flaw I found in it was Piter.  Piter had a very small part in the original novel, but he was a joy to read.  This did not portray him very well.  He is a man who is incredibly addicted to spice and who loathes his position as being mentat to the Baron, as well as hating Vladamir himself.

Dr. Yeuh as well as Thufir were very poorly portrayed, especially Thufir who was barely in the film at all.  I'd say something about the way he was portrayed, but...there's really nothing to comment on.  They never made it very clear what Yeuh's betrayel meant, especially the breaking of his Imperial conditioning.

Also, can anyone tell me why Hasamir was in the miniseries at all?  And the way the members of the Spacing Guild were so cheesily played out seemed a bit too over the top to not make them seem laughable.

These are my major complaints.  I guess they might not be as big of a deal, but they were all characters I was looking forward to seeing and characterized correctly.  I think it failed rather miserably in that respect.

As far as giving the novel the epic scope it deserves, it served rather well.  The costuming and sets were beautifully done.  I thought that Jessica and the Baron were very well portrayed.

You may think I'm complaining too much about the characters, but this is a character driven story, so to go half way with that seems to make it half of what it should have been.",1131753600,4,2759,4.365422396856582

1391030,5,B000053V8F,"I have read the entire Dune series.  The characters and stories permanently entered my imagination.  While I was disappointed with the Lynch version, I thought this one really and truly hit the bullseye, perhaps in large part because most of the actors are highly talented unknowns.  Unable to rely on star power - with the exception of WIlliam Hurt, whose Duke Leto is subtle and cunning - the director in my viewing was freed to construct his own vision of the great novel.

The casting, I found, is exceptional and nearly perfect - a must with a story that, unusual for scifi, develops such interesting characters.  Newman is a really great Paul, a brooding prophet who feels trapped by his destiny as a liberator and destroyer.  His mother and Chani are also superb, played by beautiful and talented actresses who are not Paltrow-wannabee stick figures.  Then there is Stilgar, who is portrayed by a German actor with incredible, though muted power, a true leader who can adapt to revolutionary change; the same can be said of Gurney Halleck.  Finally, you could completely believe Giancarlo's emperor, whose arrogance is matched only by the decay of his empire.  It was so refreshing to see this talent come to full flower.  The only one I didn't think that good was the Baron Harkonnen, who came off as something of a caricature to me, laughing studiply at his deviousness in every scene.

Then there is the wonder of the setting, which the computer-generated scenary succeeds in evoking.  At least for me, I could believe in what I was seeing and revel in the grand themes - so unique in scifi - of a messiah and revolutionary, of bursting the bounds of human possibility as defined by genetics and politics, of the unpredictable X factor in the spice and the worms as they influence humanity decisively.

I do not know, however, if this miniseries would succeed with those who did not read the book first.  The ideas are so complex and recondite that I would recommend at least keeping the first novel handy, with the explanations in the appendix.

Warmly recommended for all serious fans of scifi.  This is a superior product.",1126915200,6,2135,4.776566757493188

2)I've only read this once and I can see how much the book gives you, and if I hadn't read the book I would be lost. The movie doesn't do a good job of explaining what's going on.

3)They over use the special effects. Every scene it seemed to be powered by these effects in some way or another. If they had used some of the funding to shoot at some place that actually resembled Dune it would have improved the movie alot.

1391033,5,B000053V8F,"I have to confess that I was never fully impressed with Peter Lynch's 1984 version of Dune.  While it had its good elements (including excellent performances on the part of Patrick Stewart and others), its weaknesses made me instantly shy away.  For one thing, the Pink Floyd music with its cheesy synthesizers instantly dated the movie to the 1980s and makes me cringe to this day.  Additionally, its theatrical runtime was simply insufficient to convene the multitude of deep messages about politics, power, and the future of the human race. Even the extended version at 190 minutes somehow fails to please. Lynch even admitted in an interview that he ""sold out"" and comprimised on his version of Dune.

When the Sci Fi channel announced this new version of Dune some years later, I was skeptical and also enthusiastic. But at the end, I was pleasantly surprised.

For one, Harrison's Baron Harkonnen is much more devious and believable than Lynch's shallow and outwardly disgusting zit-faced Harkonnen.  Gone is the antiquated Lynch music, replaced with a soulful soundtrack beautifully by Graeme Revell.  The special effects were superior of course, having 16 years to the filmmakers' advantage.  The acting in this version was as good or better than Lynch's actors with few exceptions.

Of course the Harrison version still has some flaws - in many scenes, Fremen do not wear their stillsuits, a wasteful practice in the desert world of Arrakis.  The ""star"" of the movie, William Hurt (as Duke Leto), comes off as stilted and weak, not strong-willed and seemingly indominable as Duke Leto is portrayed in the novel.  His appearances are brief, however, and easily dismissed.  Many people were put off by many scenes in which it is obvious that the actors are on a cheap set.  Again, this is easy to dismiss considering the limitations of this made-for-tv movie's budget.  In their defense, this version was longer to begin with and had to pay the actors and still have enough for starships, worm scenes, fighting scenes and many other things.

The director's cut strangely develops the Irulan character more, which is slightly irritating given that she has such a small role in the book.  This is balanced by the additional scenes that help us better understand the Liet-Kynes character, however.

Of course, I do not believe that any film can adequately express Frank Herbert's vision as well as the novel.  The subtleties and nuances are so many, and difficult to put forth onscreen.  But overall, I believe this version by Harrison(and to a greater extent, the director's cut) are far closer to the Dune novel than Lynch's version. For my money, this is the best version of Dune, short of reading the novel.",1122854400,2,2715,4.953642384105961

I'm not a fan of David Lynch's liberties with the interpretation (weirding modules, etc.), but even with that, it comes more to the feel and style of the book than the Sci-Fi version. The Sci-Fi version was simply a poorly acted movie about some outerspace adventure - not the extremely intricate and subtle story that Herbert had envisioned. For example, one of the main aspects of the book, the *extreme* value of water, was effectively dismissed by the Sci-Fi version with open windows (Jessica stands near an open window enjoying the Arakeen breeze) and flowing fountains. Castle Caladan looked like the bridge of a StarTrek ship, not the ages old ""castle"" filled steeped in history. But despite all of this, the acting is what was most lacking. Paul Atreides acts as a petulant child, not the result of strict training and self-discipline. Jessica seems a half-aware dolt asking questions she should know the answers to. All-in-all, I blame the director for this travesty. As I see it, this version has no strengths, only weaknesses.",1121904000,20,1112,4.983870967741935

One reviewer said it best when he said it was great because it could stand alone as a movie of its own.  The sci fi verson wasn't good alone, or as a person who had read the book.  One of my biggest complaints was with Mohiam who wasn't in any way like the reverend mother in the book and with Paul, who was simply cast poorly.  Anyway, the Lynch version is a really entertaining movie that is fun to watch despite the differences from the book.  This version on the other hand will have most dune fans frustrated the whole time.  My advice is to buy the David Lynch version and rent this version if you really must see it.

Horrible.  WHile watching this mini-series I could not stop frowning and having to remind myself I was watching Dune.  I liked David Lynch's version even though it changed some things and added some things.  That's what 'adapted' means. You need to change certain things so it translates on film, they are different mediums, especially dealing with the complexities of the novel and it's structure, style and points of view.  All things considered, Lynch's Dune was pretty good/ESPECIALLY the design and look of the film.

  Okay, now the mini-series....Was it me or did the costumes look really bad and inappropriate for DUNE?  Things looked horrible and plain out wrong!  Why do the Bene Gesserit look like Vegas nuns and all the actors look weired. (In Lycnh's version Reverend Mother Helen Mohiam had silver capped teeth or something like that, AS SHE DOES IN THE ORIGINAL BOOK.  Here in the series she looks like one of those horrible porn versions of an alien/sword fantasy woman who was not imposing at all.

I agree with one reviewer here that said the actors were horrible.  I remember watching a seen with Muad'Dib and Gurney Halleck  and the sheer bad acting between them was ghastly.  The actors playing Gurney Hallack and Chani just didn't look right (are they professional actors? surely they don't come from theater, if they did they would be good).  What's his face as Paul Muad'Dib was just the wrong choice, he looked like he was thirty, at least they guy who played him in Lynch's version was good and could pass for 21 if not 15 (as he is in the beginning of the Dune novel).

Basically , the look of the film : costumes, cinematography and colors used just looked hacky and ugly. The series was also boring and did not have the great feel of the novels (of which I have read at least twice and absolutely loved).  So maybe it went chronologically and was truer to the books than Lynch's version, at least in the film version was interesting and fresh with good costumes, good acting, had good atmosphere and truly innovative.

But even given the extra time this miniseries does not do much of a better job. Moreover, aalthough the sets and costumes are terrific, the special effects seem almost wondrously shoddy and unconvincing: it's always clear the actor playing Baron Harkonnen is on some sort of moving cherrypicker (the filmmakers don't even attempt to make it look like he's really flying--they almost never shoot him below the waist), and the actors always look like they're against bluescreens superimposed with cheap CGI effects when they're outside. Things aren't helped out much either by the cinematographer's experimental use of high-contrast colored lighting, which end up making Herbert's Arrakis seem more horribly akin to Joshua Logan's Bali Ha'i than anything else. Finally, with the exception of Saskia Reeves as Lady Jessica, the cast is uniformly weak: Alec Newman is insistently unlikeable as Paul/Muad'dib, and William Hurt murmurs his way through the part of Duke Leto Atreides. About all this adaptation really has going for it is Herbert's unique transplantation of Islamic religion, Renaissance court intrigues, and 20th-c. ecological concerns into a space opera setting--but that's enough to still keep you watching, whatever the miniseries's other deficiencies.",1113609600,6,1581,5.483606557377049

Despite this, I feel this ""Dune"" to be superior to the David Lynch (and I'm  Lynch fan) in nearly every regard.  Certainly no one expects television series to match up to the lavishness of a film production, do they?

Lynch's Dune was budgeted at $50 million in 1984 - had 75 stages, with 200 workers taking months just to clear the desert, the project took something like 3 1/2 years of filming and editing (six years from pre-production to release).  In today's dollars Lynch's Dune would cost roughly between $85 - $100million).

Contrast this with the Doom Miniseries which stretches out over 6 hours of film, took four months and was achieved on a budget of $20 million dollars in 2000.

I've grown to love this Dune and repeated viewings have allowed me to see some of the subtleties in the acting which I think is where the strength of this lies.  Hurt seems a bit inert at first but he conveys the benevolence that is inherent to Leto's character.

Alec Newman is something of a revelation.  His moody, spoiled, Paul is right on the money, giving no hint of the depth of character that he will develop as Muad'Dib nor the dark wildness he will show as he shares his visions with his mother and reveals unwanted truths.

All the other people, the Mentats and the Spacing Guild, all looked like the designer tried to come up with the weirdest looking thing he/she possibly could.

1391052,3,B000053V8F,"I am a huge fan of Dune, always have been.  And I will say I enjoyed the Sci-Fi Channel Dune Mini-series, but find some of its weaknesses very annoying.  I still believe David Lynch's Dune is VASTLY superior in quality to this enjoyable but luke-warm exercise in mediocrity.  Instead of writting paragraph after paragraph of praise or flamming, like some Dune fans, I'm going to be quick and to the point...

For one, the quality of the production values on David Lynch's Dune are much higher in ALL of the follwing:

Acting:  I like William Hurt and all and he did a fine Duke, but the cast on Lynch's Dune was great, especially Patrick Stewart and whoever the guy is who played the Baaron, he was amazing. (did you know Salvador Dali was originally cast to play the Emperor in a previous attempt to bring Dune to film?)  And I hate to admit it...but Sting was cool as an arrogant and homicidal Feyd.

Costumes and Sets:  The costumes on Davind Lynch's Dune are LIGHTYEARS ahead of the Sci-Fi mini-series, especially with the stillsuits, they look fantastic.  But they look like a joke on the mini-series.  And don't get me started on the other costumes from the mini-series, the Harkonnen and Atredies house uniforms were terrible.  The Sardukar uniforms were even WORSE, you're telling me the most feared soldiers in the universe wear a uniform that GAY, complete with giant beret?..c'mon!  And the formal wear worn by royalty and dignitaries looks like it belongs in a bad episode of Star Trek, in the freakin sixties! The butterflies all over the dress of the Emperors Daughter, YIKES!
The sets on both films are good, but Lynch's fit the mood of the film much more and the mini-series has questionable lighting (Yea....The background is purple but the sand they walk on is green....okaaayyy...)

Special Effects: The Mini-series has adequate special effects, but you can easily tell they are computer-generated, they seem detached from the world around them.  Definately not Lord of the Rings quality animation.  David Lynch's Dune has wonderful effects, considering that it is over 20 years old and still looks more convincing than the computer generated mini-series.

Score and sounds:  Though I did not mind the score on the mini-series, you can't deny the over-powering epic feel of the Movie Soundtrack, 80's synthasizer aside.

Now, after bashing it, I will sell the mini-series on it's strong point, it's faithfulness to the original novel.  It is much closer to Frank Herbert's masterpiece.  However I'm not terribly bothered by the fact that Lynch's movie takes some departures.  For example, David Lynch's Dune altered the roll of ""The Wierding Way"".  Instead of the hard to explain ""Space Kung-Fu"" it is, they described it as a secret weapon developed by House Atredies using sound.  I find changes like this to be a technicality because I believe all core aspects and themes of the book can be found in Lynch's Dune.

When I read the original, or any book from the Dune saga, the characters and things I see in my head are all borrowed from the amazing artisanship and work from David Lynch's Dune.  That's what Dune is supposed to look and sound like, story aside.

Simply put, if you are a story purist you will prefer the mini-series.  If you are a film buff, you will prefer the quality of work on Lynch's Dune.  But I'd just recomend you not get upset about it and own both of them like me!  :)",1102636800,5,3417,4.761904761904762
1391053,4,B000053V8F,"I write this review as a long-time Dune afficianado, having read all of the novels and further, having viewed the original David Lynch film more times than I care to admit.  Dune is a great story, and it is worthy of this degree of enthusiasm.

For those who are new to Dune, this is the story of political intrigue set within a human Galactic Empire in the year 10,191.  Mankind has spread to many worlds among the stars, made possible by a kind of faster-than-light space travel.  This form of space travel is utterly dependent upon the spice melange (much as our own time is dependent upon oil).  Melange enables space navigators to enter into the ""navigation trance"" enabling them to select a safe route for a spaceship to travel.  Melange can be found only upon one planet--the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune.  Melange extends life and is greatly desired by aristocrats within the Empire, but of course its use in promoting space travel and commerce is what makes it the center of intrigue and political power.  Dune is the story of a struggle between the Imperial house, and two other Great Houses to control Dune, the spice, and ultimately the Empire.

Dune the novel is initially a hard slog, but it eventually rewards the reader because Dune is arguably the greatest work of imagination of all time.  The great triumph of Dune is that it presents us with a universe and society utterly unlike our own, but with a realism and internal consistency that is completely convincing. This is a great story.  It is also a long story, not easily adapted to the format of a 3 hour movie.

This miniseries succeeds partly because Dune is almost perfect for the miniseries format.  The original David Lynch film fell short specifically because it simply had to make too many compromises to fit the format of a feature-length film.  The first half of the Lynch film was superb, benefiting from its all-star cast and incredible budget, special effects, and sets, but it went downhill in the seond half.  As Dune afficianados know, the Lynch film also took liberties with the story, primarily by introducing the ""wierding modules"" as the secret to Atreides military proficiency rather than the specialized combat techniques of the novel.

This miniseries is an almost linear depiction of the Frank Herbert novel to the screen--the script takes few liberties with the original story, the only one coming to mind is the somewhat enhanced role of Princess Irulan.  This worked well, and in no way changes the fact that this miniseries truly is Herbert's novel transported to the screen.  The story is wonderful to follow, and this miniseries is about as good a presentation of Dune as anyone is ever likely to make.  It succeeds and succeeds well.

The main shortfall of the miniseries is the casting of Alec Newman as Paul Atreides, the leading protagonist of the Dune story.  Newman lacks the stature to carry off the role of Paul--oh, if only Kyle MacLachlan, who played Paul in the Lynch film had been available!  William Hurt as the Duke Leto Atreides is controversial; some feel that he was unenthusiastic about the role, and presented a somewhat sleepy performance.  I thought Hurt did an adequate job, but not as good as Jurgen Prochnow in the Lynch film.  The rest of the cast in the miniseries was very good, and compares reasonably well to the all-star cast in the Lynch film.

The sets, special effects, etc., while not state-of-the-art compared to the latest big budget films, are nevertheless very, very good; far better than one normally finds in made-for-TV productions.  The viewer will be impressed with the imaginative and lavish sets, costumes, and effects.

If you have seen the theatrical version of the other movie you will recognise some scenes and dialogue that are verbatim, and justly lifted from the excellent book by Frank Herbert. Therein however begins the problem, if you HAVE seen the other movie, this is a lumbering, and ultimately too long adaptation that tries, but never shakes of the ""made for TV feel"". The acting isn't bad, but it isn't great either, and you feel that most of the characters are reading lines, rather than living the story. Another grumble would be the casting, as some of the characters come across as so unlike what one expects, they detract from the story in a critical fashion. If this is your first taste of Dune, you may find this review overly critical, but what this film made up for in better special effects, and more complete storytelling, than it's theatrical predecessor it completely lacked in believable acting. Aside from William Hurt, there are few big names here, which may be another reason the finished product is less than polished, and as much as I have tried to like this, the David Lynch film (albeit shorter) does much more to capture the ""spirit"" of Herberts epic story.

Yes, I agree very much with what Amazon.com had to say.  The architecture is impressive.  The sets are very interesting and the costumes, I believe, were made by a cutting edge French fashion agency.  This is the strength of this version - the sets and costumes.  However.
The acting suffers greatly.  Like most cg filled epics of our day, this one suffers from what I like to call ""Video game cutscene syndrome.""  That is, that what should be an entertainment experience in its own right becomes little more than a computer graphics showcase (a non-interactive one, unlike a real video game).  When acting is sacrificed for the sake of cg graphics, the result is little more than a crippled video game experience, one in which you are unable to control the action and must sit passively watching the equivalent of a video game cutscene.  The acting is downright terrible, with the exception of the Baron and some of the development surrounding Duke Leto.  This version, unlike the David Lynch one, is pure eye candy, nothing more, nothing less.

1391058,4,B000053V8F,"There are a lot of arguments over hardcore David Lynch fans and fans of the movie compared to fans of this min series.  So I am going to look at both in my review of this.
Good points of the Lynch movie:
Costumes, a lot of people consider this a strong point, they were from outer space, which was fitting.  The makeup was a bit overdone, but worked for some characters, such as the mentats.  The cinematography was interesting and original.
Bad Points of the Lynch movie:
It was choppy and poorly edited, they seem to jump over ideas and plot elements with little or no explanation.  The baron wasn't believable, he was loud and thuggish, didn't seem at all like a leader a large group of people would follow.  Sting was a poor choice for Feyd, Rabban was barely touched on.  Some of the sequences were a bit cheesy, when they were riding the worms the music and the filming was almost laughable.  Though I love Patric Stewart, he was too rigid as gurney hallek.
There is also the interesting note that David Lynch hated this movie and considered it his weakest project.  Allegedly his name wasn't on the poster but was attached to the movie later due to contractual obligations.
The mini series
Good points:
It was much longer and had an open feel to it, didn't jump from place to place.  They spent more time with some of the main characters.  The empiress actually has a role rather than just a few lines.  It followed the book, and added scenes that fit the story, i.e. the banquet on Arrakis, the Baron plotting with his nephews.  The Harkonnens seemed more realistic;  the Baron was a flamer, devious, and egotistical.  Feyd seemed much more the spoiled sociopath that he was supposed to be.  Rabban was thuggish and violent.  Gurney Hallek was more animated and would play his instrument.  The show had a feeling of a shakesperan play with the pacing and dialogue.
the bad
Two of the main actors weren't up to par.  William Hurt was poorly chosen and seems more like a aide to a Duke than the Duke himself.  Paul Artredes just seems lazy, like this wasn't the role he wanted, just the role he got. They didn't do what a lot of people were hoping for, more of a look into the Bene Gesseret.  The Lady Jessica wasn't terrible, but also wasn't spectacular.  She was a tough character though, someone who was basically a plant for another order who'd given up on her duties.
All in all I did like some aspects of the David Lynch movie, which is saying a lot, I hate David Lynch's other movies.  But in a whole I don't consider it a good movie.  It is a collection of ideas, interesting sequences, and good costumes, not a good movie.  Even the extended versions make you feel like you are missing something.  Although it could be argued that parts of it were better than the mini series, they are only parts, not a movie.
The mini series gave more of a broad view of the world of Dune.  The characters are explored beyond what the book gave us.  They also add scenes that were not originally in the novel, but they fit.  Feyd's training on slave gladiators, Baron's plotting with his nephews, the banquet of the royal houses on Arrakis, the daily lives of the Freeman, etc....  For its shortcomings, it is a much better movie in the whole.",1087776000,5,3243,4.477001703577513
1391059,4,B000053V8F,"This seems like a pretty good adaptation for the mini-series format. The figures are clearly drawn, for people who came in late. The action is well paced, to keep people coming back. The characters are bold, and mythic, the way Herbert drew them originally.
The script-writer has taken some liberties with the story. Well, some were needed for a successful screen play. The original books were masses of subtle and interlocked detail, way too much to convey on screen. If a few points were lost in the translation, it was because the TV series is a different dramatic language than the book. A few points were enhanced, too. Irulan, for example, is much stronger on screen than I remember her in the original. Perhaps her additional presence isn't 100% authentic - if so, I consider the difference very tolerable.
There are a few points that didn't work for me.  I'm not sure why the imperial soldiers wore their coloful dress uniforms into the field, for example, and the sword-vs-gun battles were a little hard to swallow. The color schemes were a bit florid, as well. Intense, ultramarine blue lighting meant ""night"", even when background lighting was of other color. Tangerine orange encoded the desert scenes, and so on. Some of these problems were fixed later in the series, but jarred in this set.
It's watchable entertainment, and doesn't demand too much of the viewer. It's a bit long to watch all at one sitting, but was never intended as a single endurance exercise. I won't be giving this one away, but I won't be rushing back to it, either.",1084924800,,1553,4.773234200743494
1391070,3,B000053V8F,"Synopsis:
In the far future, Duke Leo Atreides, his concubine and his son Paul travel to administer the planet known as Arrakis (or Dune), the source of a substance known as Spice. Spice is the lifeblood of the Human Empire, lengthening life and making interstellar travel possible. But betrayal by a member of the family's court and a powerplay by the corrupt Baron Harkonan results in the death of Duke Leo and force Paul and his mother to take refuge deep in the deserts of Arrakis.  From there, they begin a campaign to fight back and gain revenge.  But there is more going on than mere politics, for there is a prophecy of the rise of a messiah type figure, and Paul has somehow managed to fit into the center of it.
About the Miniseries:
Frank Herbert's Dune is based on a book by Frank Herbert, published in the 1970's. It has become a classic and easily one of the most unique works of Science-fiction in the past 30 years.  Based on the book, this miniseries isn't the first time it has been rendered on screen. The last was in a film production in 1984 that many hard core fans of the Dune mythos have a tendency to dislike because it plays a little more fast and loose with the story than most would have like.
Produced by the Sci-fi Channel, this 4 hour and 20 minute miniseries was an attempt to more accurately bring the book to life.
""Frank Herbert's Dune"" has a star studded cast, including, Academy Award winner William Hurt (as Duke Leo Atreidies), Ian Mcniece (as Baron Harkonan), and Uwe Ochsenknect (as Stilgar). It is written and directed by veteran TV director John Harrison and boasts the talents of a cinematographer and a costume designer that were both Academy Award winners.
In many ways, ""Frank Herbert's Dune is an epic production.  The visuals are usually quite spectacular and the set design easily manages to look futuristic and grand. It's clear that a lot of attention to detail was put into them.  These sets are often enhanced with computer generated imagery, like Ornithopters, cityscapes and the like. It usually works quite well, usually providing the film with an epic and polished feel.
Likewise, the costuming is excellent. With a flair for an epic aristocratic feel, it manages to look practical, but imaginative enough to make it believable for some far future civilization.  My only complaint is that the stil-suits (suits designed to save and recycle the body's perspiration for use in the desert) aren't very exciting to look at.  As easily one of the neatest inventions of the Dune universe, it would have been nice to see them done with a little more flair.
Unfortunately, despite the star-studded production and acting team, and the excellent set and costume design, this miniseries ends up falling a little flat.
The acting is one place where this obvious. Consisting of a cast of TV and stage actors, occasionally an actor's performance will make you cringe.  P.H Moriarty (as Gurney Halleck) is the worst of these, managing to be so stagy and forced in almost all of his scenes as to hurt the performances of the actors who played with him. It's a shame because he plays a somewhat major role.
Another area, camera direction, also suffers. Despite having a Oscar winning cinematographer like Vttorio Storaro on staff, the cinematography is marred by the poor and unimaginative camera direction so common in made for TV productions. The film shots are usually fairly simple in their design and they tend to last a little longer than necessary, especially where scenery is concerned.  This helps to lower the quality of the production and slow down the film altogether.
In the same respect, editing is almost always the inevitable downfall of most miniseries.  With time requirements forcing a production to be a certain length, you often end up with something that could have fit into three hours, being stretched into four.  That's how Dune feels.  There are plenty of sequences that should have been cut to make the production flow better. This is especially true once you get to the middle of the series.
Overall, Dune drags badly in points, suffers from spotty acting and poor film direction, but it manages to maintain the integrity of Frank Herbert's vision overall. It has some great moments, and can be a fun watch, if you have the patience to sit through it all.
About the DVD:
Frank Herbert's Dune comes in a double door hard case on two DVDs.  The film is presented in 1.77:1 widescreen format and Dolby Surround Sound.  It has only one audio track, in English and no subtitles.
The Picture and sound for this release are pretty good. The video is quite clear with only a few noticeable digital artifacts on high resolution screens.  Likewise, the sound transfer sounds excellent.
This DVD release does have special features including, a 25 minute ""behind the scenes"" featurette, a written treatise on the cinematography in Dune (by Vittorio Storaro), a gallery of sketches and stills, and a selected of cast and crew information page.
The best of these features, is of course, the Behind the Scenes Featurette. While it's not the best of these types of things that I've seen, it's a good overview of the production and the story for those who don't know anything about it and it contains quite a few interesting notes about why certain things were done a certain way.
The written treatise is something of a let down. I have no idea why they chose to place a series of written screens on a DVD in this fashion instead of something more imaginative like a narrated series of still shots.  It's interesting, but most people will not bother to read it.  People don't buy DVD's to read books.
Bottom Line:
A decent, occasionally spotty miniseries on a low frill DVD release. 3 stars.",1080777600,,5743,4.761569416498994
1391071,1,B000053V8F,"First let me say this, I have not seen the David Lynch version of Dune.  It is hard for me to believe that it could be any worse than this mini-series.  The last 40 minutes are more like the kind of film I was expecting, unfortunately I had to set through 244 minutes of some of the most boring science fiction I have seen in a long time.  This mini-series would be a good cure for people who have insomnia.",1080777600,4,407,4.0625
1391072,4,B000053V8F,"Frank Herebert's Dune trilogy is as huge to science fiction as The Lord of the Rings is to fantasy, and is second in the scope of its vision only to Isaac Asimov's Foundation series.  The first book was turned into a movie and this miniseries.  The miniseries is, in this reviewer's opinion, better than the original movie.  The story takes place in a galactic empire where planetary systems are controlled by three groups:  the royal houses, the religous priestesses, and the spacing guild, which makes interstellar travel possible.

The story takes place on Arakis, the desert planet also known as Dune.  One of the lifeforms on the planet is the enormous ""worm."" Full grown worms are the size of an airport terminal, and will easily devour anything smaller than a Boeing 747.  Worms live in the desert and produce ""spice.""  Spice is a halucinogen which is necessary for the spiritual powers of the prieshood, intersteller transportation, and political control.  It is the most valuable commodity in the galaxy and is only produced on Arakis.

The Emperor sees the House Atreides as a threat to his control of the empire because of Duke Leto Atreides popularity amoungst the other royal houses.  Rather than get his hands dirty, the Emperor replaces House Harkonnen's control of the planet Dune with House Atreides, and plots to have the Harkonnens kill the Duke Leto Atreides, his only son and concubine, and reassume control of Dune.  The plan almost succeeds, but the the Duke's son, Paul, and concubine, Lady Jessica, escape to the deep desert.  Under the influence of Spice, Paul (who is now the new duke) becomes a messsiah to the desert denisens of the planet, and leads them in rebellion, retaking control of Arakis, and seizing control of the entire empire.

My recollection of the cinematic version was that it was too compressed to get the story line of the book, almost as bad as my summary above, and was too comic-bookish for the subject matter.  Dune certainly has parallels to both Lawrence of Arabia and to the real world politics of oil/religion in the middle east.  It deserves better treatment than it got in the big screen version.  The TV miniseries fixes these problems simply by having the time to present the story, and treating the material with a more matter of fact rendition.

But where the cinematic version had the big screen, the miniseries fails because the material is too big for the small screen.  The sets and costumes are magnificent.  The production values are as good as I have seen on TV.  But the scope and grandeur of Dune is lost on a 27"" TV screen.

The other problems are that the acting is dry and unemotional, and some of the special effects have been skimped on.  You never get to like the protagonists.  Given these limitations, it is, in my opinion, the better version in that you can follow the story and see what Frank Herbert imagined.

I highly recommend the DVD over the VHS because the quality of the video is significantly better.",1080172800,,2990,4.770428015564202
1391073,5,B000053V8F,"I have never read the dune books, but having viewed this film, I think I may invest the time. I like the story very much, but to tell you the truth, untill I read the books and am able to compare them with the film, I have to say that the quality of the film appeals more to me than the story. That's not to say that I ""dislike"" the story- I simply find it a little too jaded in regard to the suggested opinion of human nature. That being said, I do not think that human beings are absolutley perfect, nor do I see the world through rose colored glasses; however, I AM of a more optimistic mind- I think humankind is capable of far deeper righteousness than the film's story suggests. Also, I find the perverse behavior of the ""Harkonnen"" House very difficult to watch. Nevertheless, overall, the film thrills me from begining to end as a masterpiece of cinematography, and artistic performances.
The relationship between Duke Leto and Jessica, and their personal history and how it relates to and shapes the plot of the entire ""Dune"" story is incredibly intriguing. I guess if I had one wish from the film, it would be that MUCH more time had been devoted to THEIR story, and the strange beauty of their relationship, and the woman who is called  ""wife"".... having been called ""wife"" to a man for almost 30 years now, myself, it appeals to me on a very personal level... and so may it to you who are thinking of buying this film. If Dune is the 'stuff' that thrills you, you are in for a treat if you make the wise decision to buy this film.",1077580800,,1542,4.335640138408304
1391074,1,B000053V8F,"Oh dear, oh dear. I have been a fan of the Dune book series for years. A Sci-Fi Lord of the Rings if I can be permitted to fit the work into that category. When the original David Lynch film was released, I was impressed with the way the movie captured the look and feel of the books and the excellent use of voice over to put elements of the book onto the screen. A key element of the book is what is going on in the minds of the characters, how they read people, how the understand things that others cannot. In my opinion, the movie was true to the book and really was for the Dune fan, not your casual movie goer.
Now, along comes a new slant on the work. A mini-series. I was excited by the idea. Would the mini-series contain elements that the movie couldn't (time was a factor then, two hour movies weren't popular for movie goers)? Would we now have the full saga on the screen with no fear of being too long? Would the effects of today allow the series to be awesome in delivery?
Well, what we have here is a poorly acted; fast paced and poorly created piece of work. Whilst the script is true to the book, certain elements are still missing.
Everything moves too fast where the Lynch movie (only being just over two hours long) had the perfect pace.
The character of Paul Atreides is presented as an angry, almost spoilt child, approach. Not the intelligent future Duke he is in the books.
The effects are bad. Look out for the scene when Paul and Jessica run from the worm after being left in the desert. Almost slapstick.
The acting is shameful. The character of Gurney Halleck is dreadful and William Hurt (who I thought would be excellent in this series) is not the Duke I imagined. There is just no connection between the characters, no love or bond between them. Also, some of the accents the characters have make it hard to understand what they are saying.
As a dune fan, I felt let down. This could have been a huge success, but instead, the ""made for TV"" label keeps it's reputation.
It's a shame Lynch couldn't continue where he had left off. I would love to see his interpretation of the Children of Dune and all the books for that matter.",1074729600,9,2160,4.322660098522167
1391075,4,B000053V8F,"As a TV miniseries, this version of Dune worked extremely well. As a DVD it is nice because you can watch as much of it as you like at one time - it's broken into three 90 minute ""episodes."" The acting is much better than average for television, and the sets and costumes are really superb. The portrayal of the primitive yet sophisticated (and beautifully spiritual) fremen culture will have you cheering for their cause. And the evil baron and emporer, as well as the weasly spicing guild nerds, provide a terrific and fun element of comedy to the production. (They sure have a lot of weird, funky hats in this universe !!)
The special effects and battle scenes do leave something to be desired, although the space scenes actually look pretty real. One star is lost for the cheesy looking battle scenes and fake looking desert mouse, and the DVD itself is pretty bare bones. Nevertheless, this DVD is worthwhile addition to your science fiction collection, especially since the price is so reasonable.
PS - I'm getting really annoyed with reviewers who compare a film to the book upon which it is based, and complain when they don't coincide exactly. When a film is ""based"" on a novel, it is not necessary to copy it verbatim.

This mini-series, however, was fantastic on an epic scale.  Having seen the badly done 80s movie, I was intrigued with the idea of the Sci-Fi Channel taking on one of the most revered sci-fi space operas and turning it into a lavish mini-series (it's a shame the Sci-Fi Channel chooses to produce mostly B-movie garbage instead of great sci-fi like this).  The casting is both a strength and a weakness for the movie.  William Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides and Ian McNeice as Baron Harkonnen are perfect; however, Alec Newman as Paul Atreides/Muad'Dib and Saskia Reeves as Lady Jessica are bland at best, which is a shame since they are the center of so much of the story. As to the production, it was lavish and beautiful -- definitely some of the best to grace television in a long, long time.

1391080,4,B000053V8F,"Dune, Arrakis, desert planet. More than a mere science fiction novel, Dune touches upon a variety of themes: ecology, politics, religion, messiahs, prescience, and ultimately at the core is a detailed study on human nature and how humans deal with larger issues, sometimes leading to unavoidable death and destruction. This is what many Dune fans have waited for, some for as many as three and a half decades. Those who were disappointed by David Lynch's 1984 film release will find a good deal more of the book actually made it on screen this time around with John Harrison's writing and direction. While this may be the most complete version of Dune that will ever be filmed and it is a sumptuous feast of the eyes thanks in part to Vitorrio Storaro's cinematography, the movie as a whole is often uninspired, with some dreadful casting and questionable directorial choices.
The most difficult role of the movie, both in terms of casting and in performing, is, undoubtedly, the role of Paul Atreides, the young boy-turned-messiah. In a world of feudal lords, dukes and emperors, this son of a duke, played by Alec Newman, comes across as a spoiled whiny child, with little sense of his position and place in the greater scheme of things. Not a good start for a story that deals with such grand themes. When this boy assumes the leadership that is expected of him, we see unnoticeable growth into maturity but rather the whiny child transforms into a bitter and angry young man. The character is not at all the kind of lead an audience is going to sympathize with nor cheer for. When he finally claims his throne on screen, we find him once again slumped into his chair/throne, with no regal presence and in a karate kid outfit. The role needs a commanding, demanding, and controlling presence, but what we get from Mr. Newman is nothing more than a passive aggressive, whiny brat who finally has gotten his way. With such a weak lead, the movie is left with a substantial black hole into which the movie rapidly gets sucked into.
""Like father, like son,"" the saying goes, and as this Paul is problematic, so is his father, Duke Leto Atreides, played by William Hurt. We are expected to see him as the good guy, but with a performance that lacks any identifiable action in any of the scenes, we are left to wonder what is his motivation? Where is the man who willingly rushes into a battle, a battle which he knows he cannot win, with strength and conviction? Where is the hero we desperately want in a movie? Not here. In fact there are few heroes in this film, not even among the desert folk, the Fremen.
The Fremen are a desert people, living on the fringes of society, with deep spiritual beliefs and a notion that a prophet will come from another world and lead them to salvation. Any filmed version of this book will face the challenge of presenting these Fremen as a believable nomadic people, living in a harsh world with harsh consequences. John Harrision gives us a people who almost fit in with Storaro's cinematography too well. These Fremen are a bit too water fat, arguably too pretty, and they move like middle aged couch potatoes rather than athletic and nimble desert warriors.
Battle scenes are perhaps the weakest point of the movie and appear generally as the mock combat, staged fights that they actually are. A few special effects dashed in here and there to make us think the ""good guys"" actually have an advantage, but at the core, these battles are truly underplayed and under-realized.
The stand out performance is that of Princess Irulan, played by Julie Cox. In a role that is little more than a prize at the end of the book, her role has been expanded substantially for this movie. She performs admirably and is the clearest and strongest character in the film. Unfortunately, she is also the most disposable character, as most of her scenes on film are only used to clarify political issues and layers of subterfuge that may be confusing to an audience who hasn't read the book. In fact, the whole film tends to oversimplify the complex story line and is generally ""dumbed down"" for wider public appeal. What is lost is the specificity and strength that makes this story unique and utterly compelling. What we are left with is a nicely orchestrated TV drama. We can hope that somewhere down the road, in another 15 years or more, maybe someone new will have the courage to really do the story, subtext and all.
The DVD Special Edition comes chock full of goodies as well, so the extras are well worth the expense and the time watching them. The navigation screens are a bit cryptic at first, but straightforward once you figure them out.
The show rates three stars, plus two for effort and beautiful visuals, and subtract one for lack of inspiration. Overall, a more than generous four stars.",1072828800,2,4823,4.681978798586573

A coherent story, emphasis on the book's major dramatic conflicts, and a realistic portrayal of the evil Harkonnens. This version of the mini-series solves many of the problems the original broadcast version DVD could not.  The final battle at the palace of Arakeen was given short shrift in the original broadcast but has much more impact here when shown in full, as originally intended.  Some scenes containing nudity were originally edited but are now much more realistic. And I for one won't complain about seeing the lovely Barbara Kodetova in the buff! All in all this is a much more satisfying experience than the original broadcast DVD and puts even more distance between itself and the Lynch movie version.  If you only buy one, buy this, and you won't regret it!",1069027200,2,890,4.92
1391084,5,B000053V8F,"Despite my 5-star rating, there are some pretty big problems that need to be pointed out:
-it was too short
-some weak casting, especially for Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam
-considering the quality of the source material, John Harrison should be ashamed of much of the writing in especially the first episode
-the Fremen aren't portrayed correctly (clean, water-fat white people?  I don't think so)
The last point doesn't really bother me, considering the circumstances, but the other three would have wiped out any chance of a perfect score if not for three main points: 1) If it were not for these bad points it would, like the book and its sequels, stand high above all others as a pinnacle of excellence of Shakespearean proportions--instead, it is forced to contend with other 5-star movies, such as Pitch Black, The Matrix and The Lord of the Rings; 2) I believe that for all its shortfalls, it really captures the spirit and essence of the novel; and 3) this DVD set includes not only a good 5-hour movie, but also a nice load of excellent special features.
The movie follows a basic sequence of increasing quality from beginning to end.  In truth, if the whole thing were like the first episode, I wouldn't have such a high opinion of it.  The words in the book should have been taken much more seriously than they were.  But the beginning isn't all bad.  On the contrary, the scenes with the Baron Harkonnen are very high quality.  Ian McNeice and Matt Keeslar work perfectly together throughout the movie.
The second episode is better than the first.  At this point, many people are unhappy, because it looks like everything was shot on a sound stage, which it was.  Part of the problem is that the sand that was delivered to them was not the same color as what they had ordered.  Personally though, I thought it added an artistic touch, giving the movie an elevated quality, like a play about an epic Greek tragedy--a quality that often matches part of the mood of the book.  It is also in this episode that you are finally treated to the outstanding performance of Barbara Kodetov, the best actress in the world.  Even if you don't like the rest of the movie, you're sure to enjoy watching her fantastic treatment of the Chani character.  Like the first episode, this one also races through the story much faster than it should.  This is unfortunate but not fatal.  By the end of this episode, you should be very excited to begin the next.
The final episode is the best of the three.  This is where director John Harrison and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro really earn their pay.  Even Zuzana Geislerov's terrible acting couldn't ruin this episode, although a better actress could still have improved it.  As it draws closer to the end, the spirit and feeling of the book are captured more closely than I would ever have thought possible.  My favorite scenes near the very end are the real reason that I couldn't bear to give it less than five stars.  If the whole thing were this good, it might give a partial idea of just how magnificent the book is.
It's also worth noting great performances by Laura Burton (Alia) and Julie Cox (Princess Irulan).  Have you ever seen a little girl acting circles around a room full of seasoned actors?  You'll have your chance in the scenes with Alia.  As for Julie Cox, she is the definitive Princess Irulan, plain and simple; although Purists might be unhappy about her expanded role.
If you don't have any experience with the books, you should be aware that The Master's writing can't be accurately adapted to the screen.  He uses techniques that are exclusive to the book format.  My point is that you should not think that watching any movie will give you much of an idea of what DUNE is all about.  But it's a great movie in its own right, and it's great to be able to see parts of the story play out in live action.
One more thing I'd like to add.  If it weren't for the book, there would be no question that this movie deserves five stars.  It's comparing the two that causes disappointment.  All of Frank Herbert's incredible dialogue is changed!  It's uncertain why such changes would be made, and they certainly don't help.  So when you watch this movie, you might try to pretend that there is no book.",1068422400,,4269,4.6158940397351
1391085,4,B000053V8F,"While it's impossible to make a perfect replica of the book (well, it's possible but it's be 20 hours long and 90% would be silent while subtitles show what the characters are thinking), this is the best job I've ever seen done.

Being an avid sci-fi fan I was a bit worried when I realized a new Dune was being made, but this rendition is fantastic. The sets are awesome even if you can sometimes tell that they are just back drops. At some points I was annoyed with the lighting and how unrealistic it became but all in all, I really enjoyed this Dune. I was especially proud of how fleshy they made Princess Irulan, seeing as they only had chapter heads to base the character off of.",1066348800,2,841,4.2625

Sure the special effects and the look was amazing, so rich in colors unlike the darker version in 1984. But the audacity to ""enhance"" the original text with scenes not in the book was atrocious. Princess Irulan is a nothing character, yet she is depicted as a serious player in the grand scheme of things in this film version. WRONG! Frank Herbert didn't make her important therefore she is not. A simple pawn in man's game for power.
The director should have stuck closer to the book and he would have pleased more people with the outcome, aside from that his film was flawless in detail to look and feel of the gritty world of Dune.",1062979200,,758,4.460431654676259

The acting was mediocre. William Hurt, who played Duke Leto mumbled his lines and Alec Newman, who played Paul Atreides (he did EXCELLENT in the sequel, ""Children of Dune"") wasn't given good enough lines.
The costumes and setting were downright awful. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give it a two. However, for a movie that didn't have a lot of money in the making, it'd have to do. This aspect is a bit annoying throughout the movie, but the story is nicely illustrated.
However, something that is infinitely good, it is a miniseries. Four and a half hours. This book apsolutely CAN NOT be nicely fit into a two hour movie, which is why I will not see the original.

1391108,4,B000053V8F,"Before ""Star Wars"" there was a book called ""Dune."" The book, written by Frank Herbert is considered a classic among many literature historians and is certainly one of the greatest sci-fi books to ever be written. It was adapted by director David Lynch in 1984 for a big-budget screen adaptation. The film was a very noble attempt and has even acquired a cult following, but it wasn't quite perfect and many ""Dune"" fans shunned it. Now, years later, director John Harrison has done his own adaptation of the book; a 5-hour miniseries that showed on the Sci-Fi channel in 2000. This version is more faithful to the book and, while it has many downsides, is better than the version David Lynch did. It's very thorough in its telling of Paul Atreidies' rise to power on the desert planet Arakkis, also known as Dune. While the middle chapter drags a little, the first and third do a great job of keeping the story going. The visual effects are not perfect. It is very obvious when scenes are done against a matte painting or a blue-screen. But the story and characters are very well thought out and these things can occasionally be overlooked. I would recommend this movie to any sci-fi buff. It's an epic tale told just right and acted very excellently.",1056758400,,1250,4.660633484162896

If scottah thinks that's better, then he should explain why Lynch has it raining at the end of the movie! Major major mistake.
The Irulan character was quite good and the character development was quite obvious as you watched the movie, i.e. you understood why they spent time on her.
I am disappointed that they left out the character Count Fenring - becuase it cuts to the heart of one of the story lines, the breeding program. But overall the mini-series did a good job of telling the Dune story.",1056672000,,818,4.571428571428571
1391110,4,B000053V8F,"Bold, creative and intelligent John Harrison's adaption of Frank Herbert's Dune is operatic in tone and style with theatrical flourish. While Harrison's adaption isn't completely faithful to the letter of the book, it is to the spirit. He manages to condense much of the politics and action of the book into a comphrensible 5 hour film. It's best moments are as lyrical as David Lynch's film but Harrison's focus is creativing a cohesive and involving narrative. On both counts Harrison is very successful.
Shot entirely on soundstages in Prague, Dune has a number of stunning performances. Alec Newman faced much criticism for his portrayal of Paul Atreides but his performance grows in confidence as his character moves from the shadow of his father Duke Leto to the savivor of an entire planet. Herbert managed to meld ecology, his fascination with the messiah myth and the court politics of 17th Century Europe into a cohesive, powerful tale set in the year 10,000.
William Hurt, again, much criticized for his tepid portrayal of Duke Leto captures the right amount of anguish and sense of duty & responsibility that faces him in taking over Arrakis the planet where Spice is found. Spice allows humans to live longer, see bits of the future and travel the universe by ""folding"" space.
All of the performances are very strong although James Watson as Duncan Idaho isn't given much screen time to demonstrate his abilities. The actor who took over the role in the sequel Children of Dune (based on Dune Messiah & Children of Dune)had more to work with. The role wasn't fleshed out a bit more but, given the confines of the screen time and the characters part in the novel, that's not a surprise.
The optical effects are frequently very good to stunning. Although CGI has come a long way since Babylon 5, there are some limitations. Still, the opticals involving the sandworms are stunning and put the visuals in Lynch's film to shame. It's a pity that Harrison didn't have a larger budget to work with but he does wonders with the budget here. The cinematography is stunning using color and lighting in imaginative new ways compared to most films and television programs.
This special edition has more than a couple of nude scenes; there's 30 minutes of additional footage for international broadcast that helps to broaded the characters, story and explain the politics and forces Paul into a forced evolution from Duke to messiah. The direction, writing and performances are very strong. While Harrison's version of Dune could have benefited from the internal monologues in Lynch's film, his actors are quite subtle in conveying the emotional state of the characters. In many respects, the cinematography and use of color is another actor in the film commenting on the actions and situations in the film.
Some of the extras here are the same as on the previous edition but there is an interesting roundtable disscussion included on technology and its effects on humanity (hosted by science fiction writer Arthur Byron Cover and featuring Harrison, Harlan Ellison and Octavia Butler among others). The interview with Harrison and his audio commentary (along with the visual effects folks and producer)enhances the DVD. There are many fascinating tidbits included throughout the commentary track.
Harrison's adaption of Children of Dune benefits from better CGI effects, a bigger budget and a much more complex plot (over the course of the two books). The direction of that film is also quite good although, again, I feel it misses Harrison's affinity for the material.",1056585600,,3571,5.023608768971332
1391121,5,B000053V8F,"Frank Herbert's Dune was very well done. The mini-series always did have it's ups and downs though. They should have put the charater's thoughts into the script which reveals the hidden plots and grudges of the contending houses. It also needed to really explain things a lot more in a few sentences like in the old film,""They tried and failed?...They tried and died."" I also liked Kyle MacLachlan's view of Paul Atreides better than Alec Newman beginning the film as a spoiled son of a Duke. I loved the way they did the eyes of the Fremen in the mini-series. And man Chani was pretty!! The best performances of this film belongs to Baron Vladimir Harkonnen and Gurney Halleck. I'm sure William Hurt loved working this project as Duke Leto Atreides since he is a die-hard Dune fan. The special effects fitted into the movie well.

The book is very complicated to be sure, and making a movie of it is not an easy task, but that does not excuse the lack of depth of this movie. Despite being more than twice as long as Lynch's version of Dune, the percentage of the total story showed is actually less. Some of the most dramatic and important lines are left out to no apparently good reason (""They tried and failed? No, they tried and died."") They would touch on subjects and neglect to add the one or two lines that would have explained it fully. The changes they made to the storyline had no purpose and added nothing (such as their emphasis on Princess Irulan, who they featured heavily for no apparent reason). They made a decision not to show us the thoughts of the characters (a major part of the total depth of the book) which would have been a OK if they had added dialogue to make up for it, but they just threw all that information away instead.
It was decently acted, and the cinematogrophy was quite good at times, though the special effects were unsually poor (that mouse looked straight out of a Pokemon cartoon). All in all I have to say I am somewhat unhappy I spent money on it. Read the book, or get Lynch's film (which has its own problems but on the whole was better.)",1055289600,,1296,4.337448559670782

Although it followed the story line pretty well it didn't seem to really connect well (for example Paul had no real transition from a 15 year old kid to Muad'dib--just happened) This was a very poor adaptation of Herbert's masterpiece, read the book and you will know what I mean. This seemed more like an after-school special effort than an epic sci-fi movie.  I was also disappointed with enormous amounts of ""skin"" that they put into the movie.
David Lynch's 1984 version (although quite strange like all David Lynch movies) was much better.  There were great acting performances in Lynch's version.  This version seemed over-acted and half-hearted all at the same time",1054080000,,795,4.830882352941177
1391124,3,B000053V8F,"Given the rather low budget the producers were able to gather, this is a solid movie.  Unlike the movie from the 1980's, this is true to the book; as opposed to some contrived melodrama pulled out of some sick sad individual's mind.
Like a good book adaption should, this movie conveys a number of idea's that a reader of the book may not grasp; such as what the worm's physical appearance is (which is pivotal to understand how remarkable the fremen are), the actual physical appearance of the fremen (the blue eyes and the like), and how grotesque the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen truly is (ideologically, and in appearance), so basically, it gives a person a physical model for what they read in the book.
However, I'm rather disappointed the producers felt the need to shell out big bucks to bring in a ""name"" actor like William Hurt. Assuming he's a method actor, I don't think he took nearly enough to prepare for his role as the Duke Leto.  And if he's not a method actor, he's obviously like one of the ""name"" wrestlers from the 80's & 90's, that independent wrestling promotions bring in, such as the Road Warriors & The Road Dogg Jesse James, who no longer care about the matches themself, and judging from their physical appearance, no longer care about entertaining fans, but only care about the money.
One can deduce from the book, that the Duke Leto was a charismatic man, who had an optimistic perspective in regard to the planet Arrakis.  And if one is to presume Hurt actually read the book (which is a dubious presumption to begin with), then he totally missed the motivation for the Duke Leto character.  A solid analogy for Hurt's misrepresentation of the Duke Leto character, is Richard Burton's portrayal of Leon Trotsky, in the ""Assasination of Trotsky""; an actor just going through-the-motions, so to speak, and taking money for a role he apparently has no interest in playing.
I mean seriously, Hurt probably amassed six-figures for this role, six-figures they could have used to increase the production value of the movie; the movie appears to have been filmed in some sort of performing arts center, kind of like a Broadway play; just a little more elaborate.
Aside from the infuriating presence of a prima donna actor, who has no interest in the Dune universe, the performances were top notch.  I have no complaint on how the other characters were portrayed...
So I would indeed recommend you purchase this movie; but I'd also recommend you try and weather Hurt's blatant misrepresentation of the Duke Leto, and watch the rest of the movie; which isn't exactly Braveheart or Gladiator, but it's not the Thin Red Line either (which is to say it's not great, but it's not total cinematic garbage either).",1053734400,,2726,4.779193205944798
1391125,5,B000053V8F,"John Harrison, in this long tape (four hours), manages to get the main atmosphere and the essential developments of the book by Frank Herbert. He puts a strong emphasis on the details about the various families, the connections between them and of course the Fremens. He is very careful to depict with enough details the political situation among the families, the emperor, the Guild of the various merchants, the smugglers on Dune itself, the clans, the religion and the tribal rules of the Fremens, and the various nodal points of the plot. We thus learn essential details like the fact that Paul Muad'dib is the nephew of Baron Harkonnen, through his mother, and so on. This is the main difference with David Lynch's Dune. While David Lynch puts a very visible emphasis on the rotting and rotten elements of these families and this situation, particularly the Baron of course, but also the total moral decay of the empire, John Harrison tries to give a fully believable version, hence the details that make this complex situation intellectually acceptable, in a way logical, even if it is the logic of rotten []motivations. This procedure hence gives a fully developed image of the Fremens and how then can be considered as desert power. Less extravagant and magical elements are used, more realistic elements are put forward. The shift that Paul undergoes in the consciousness of the Fremens from Paul Muad'dib, one more potential clan chief, to their Duke, that is the uncontested leader of all the tribes without having to challenge or accept the challenges from the various tribal chiefs is shown clearly as the acceptance to consider him as being over their tribal rules and at the same time as being invested with a higher religious value that explains this acceptation. He becomes some kind of living god and thus he no longer is of the same nature as the other tribal chiefs. This is very well shown. The common point between this version of Dune and David Lynch's is that both directors refuse to overuse special effects. They are quite limited in scope and dramatic force. They only come into the picture when it is absolutely necessary to show something that is invisible, like the visions and hallucinations Paul experiences after he has drunk the water of life. John Harrison is thus able to concentrate on human motivations, just like David Lynch was able to concentrate on human rotteness and decay. The two adaptations are not competitors. They are just different and both can be enjoyed. John Harrison's version is definitely fascinating in its exploration of human motivations and concrete events within the plot. The final marriage with the emperor's daughter is absolutely perfectly understandable as a political act though it may look like the negation of Paul's love for his Fremen concubine, and yet it does not compete with this love. This marriage just becomes a political alliance and arrangement that will forever remain on paper and will never be carnally fulfilled.

It is truer to the spirit and the letter of the novel than the David Lynch version, and it clearly explains the story to the newbie ""layperson.""  Throughout, I kept having to remind myself I was not on Broadway or the West End watching one of their fine plays because of the well-scripted dialogue and the sets.  My only troubles were the uninspired battle scenes--boring, boring, boring--and some of the acting.  The actor who played Gurney Halleck was a letdown, for example.  Lady Jessica reminded me of Diane on Cheers.  Paul sometimes got a little whiny.  But I loved what the director did with Princess Irulan's character--fleshed it out and made her an integral part of the story, all in keeping with Herbert's vision.  Baron Harkonnen virtually stole the show.  For us fans of the novel, no movie will ever be good enough because the theater of your imagination will always be clearer, sharper, and better cast than the one on your tv screen.

1391127,4,B000053V8F,"It's understandable that if you've read a book a few times, you'll have a vision on how to translate the book to the screen. However, most readers are not really authorities on how do so, nor do they have the resources to do so. I'm not either, but I know that IT IS DIFFICULT!  The Lord of the Rings crowd falls into the same trap.  You cannot make a perfect adaptation.  The screenwriters and directors have their own versions of the characters and events in the novel.  Sometimes they have to add new aspects, give other characters more purpose in the narrative.  The medium requires adaptation and adaptation requires addition and subtraction.  What you think is important may not be what the screenwriter thinks is important.  We all read the book and get different messages.
This version of Dune, being almost 5 hours long total is about as thorough as one can achieve on the screen, especially on a made-for-TV, shoestring budget.  To fit everything Herbert wrote in the book would require two or three seasons of episodes.  The screenwriter took shortcuts in places that were completely excusable.  Ultimately, this tells the story.  The actors are cast well and achieve what the screenwriter intended, though it might not be exactly what Herbert intended.  Yet Herbert's spirit is still alive.
For those who criticize the acting and fight scenes, why don't you watch the last few science fiction epics that have come out on screen and then make judgments (e.g. Yoda scene from Episode II - octogenarian vs. cartoon monkey).  The special effects were also formidable for a TV series.  It was pretty inexpensive CGI, but it achieved as well as the CGI we see in many modern sci fi films.
This was a good screen adaptation of a great book. I think a reasonable fan of the book can enjoy it, provided one doesn't go in with a checklist of factors that ""must"" be in any adaptation. It's one vision, one interpretation, probably not mine, but it's also not bad.  If you can do better, start writing your screenplay.

I'll be the first to admit that it wasn't exactly like the book (and though it was closer, SciFi's wasn't either), but there are certain glaring problems with this edition. For one, with all of the money that went into special effects, you'd think SciFi could pay to get a bigger set. The matte painting's edge can clearly be seen at the back of the 10X10 meter set. As if the technical problems (which extend far beyond the size of the sound stage) weren't enough, the acting is truly sub par. Is one looks to the David Lynch version, not only do we see a movie filmed mostly in the deserts of Mexico, we see it starring a wonderful array of actors, all of whom were at their prime. As well, tacking on Frank Herbert's name to the SciFi version of the film doesn't make it his work. If one reads interviews from the early 80's, you'll see that Herbert was working along side Lynch, and approved of the script. Why oh why did SciFi then go and spend oodles of money to ruin a perfectly good legacy? Ah yes, the ""newer = better"" theory. What a disappointment. Ah well.

The worst performance was in my opinion Baron Harkonen - it was artificial and completely unrealistic. Also ""visions""

Generally these blue Fremen eyes were very unrealistic - blue eyes does not mean that they emit light. But I like graphics, I live music and I like it.

However, fans of the book will be much more pleased with this miniseries than the movie which leaves so much unexplained that it is impossible to understand anything going on without having read the book.  The SciFi Channel's version goes into much more character development and gives attention to important details that work to tie together Herbert's intricate story-line.  Harrison's stylelized view of the Dune universe, particularly Arrakis is wonderfully inventive and gives this miniseries a look that is unique and unlike anything I've ever seen.  The characters are wonderfully portrayed by veteran William Hurt, and such delightful actors as Saska Reeves and Alec Newman.  If you desire to see a visual feast that is faithful to Herbert's vision of Dune, this is the show for you.  You will not be disappointed.

The series' best elements were the actresses Saskia Reeves, Barbora Kodetova, and Julie Cox. The sensitivity brought to Jessica, Chani, and Irulan by these actresses were wonderful. I could not have asked for a better cast of women.

The series overall is long and a little confusing for those who have never read the series. As a fan I admire the series creators' dedication to bringing forth the heart of the Herbert stories. It serves as a great introduction to the book series.",1048464000,3,604,4.752380952380952

1391148,2,B000053V8F,"I'm with the people who really wanted to like this production, but was put off by the entirely too cheap sets and use of the HORRIBLE FILTERS!  Who ever compared this to Xena was doing a discredit to that show, which at least filmed exteriors in the, well, exterior.  One reviewer said, ""Nevermind the special effects aren't up to full-blown Hollywood CGI standards.""  Hollywood?  It's not up to cable TV standards.
I made the mistake of watching the first part of ""Children of Dune"" before deciding to watch the first miniseries.  The hair, makeup, costuming, effects, and sets are all fantastic compared to the original Dune miniseries.  I had already read the review about approaching it as a theatrical production, but I found the direction and sets too distracting.  For instance, the moons never moved on the backgrounds, even when time had clearly passed.  It's an idiotic error and very careless.
The backgrounds are practically comic, at one point Paul and Lady Jessica are shown running against a blue screen, the effect is of a comedy sketch off Conan O'Brien.  I was laughing so hard I couldn't breathe, and the moment is supposed to be suspenseful! The apparent low budget also hurts the use of extras, there are supposed to be thousands of Fedyakin, and instead there are tens of tens.  Not to mention at the end, all the Major Houses are supposed to be participating in the war on Muad'Dib, but instead there are only soldiers shown in Harkonnen and Sardaukar uniforms.  Also people are constantly wandering around with their stillsuits off, skin exposed to the desert.  It would make me cringe if the desert weren't so clearly a soundstage.  And when did Herbert decide that Fremen eyes glow? Time and again, in the book, they are referred to as DARK. So many things in this miniseries are simply careless.
My final complaint about the look of the film is in the stupid filters.  It was like a madman was in charge of them, ""Look I found a green one, and here's a red one!  How about blue?!""  The scenes are literally bathed in one-tone light and the effect is distracting and gaudy.
As to the actual acting and script: I'll stay neutral on the William Hurt issue.  I've never liked him, so approaching the film from that angle, I was never going to give him a fair chance.  As to Alec Newman, who some feel mis-played Paul, I would say it was the script that betrayed Paul, not the actor.  He later does a very convincing Maud'dib.  From the first scene of Paul, the whiny brat, being pulled out of the chair, I knew that they were departing too far from the book.  While he has his moments, Paul is for the most part collected and thoughtful, and the first half of the miniseries cheerfully dumbs him down.  I think they underplayed the strangeness in him, and I can't believe they skipped his first encounter with spice-enhanced prescience.  To me that scene is elemental to who he is becoming.  At first, I thought it was a budget choice, but then I saw the later scenes with the Water of Life.  Maybe they thought it was redundant, I would certainly disagree.
The problem for me then was getting into the film on an emotional level.  It was until the last third that I could really begin to let the errors go and appreciate the story it was trying to tell.  I would have taken this filmed like an episode of Xena in a heartbeat over the supposedly ""artistic"" way it was presented.",1048032000,4,3401,4.597014925373134
1391149,3,B000053V8F,"The SciFi ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" miniseries came out 16 years after the David Lynch movie version. Lynch's movie was just over 2 hours long, and many fans disliked because of the scenes it cut out. I think that after watching a miniseries that went for a full SIX HOURS that still cut out key scenes and had to merge characters together, there has been much more appreciation for what Lynch was able to accomplish.
First, one of my key gripes with the SciFi miniseries. It constantly touted itself as being ""Frank Herbert's Dune"". Not just ""Dune"" or ""based on Dune"". And yet many of the characters, scenes and plots are FAR removed from the actual storyline. There are many invented scenes, many characters who have been severely altered. I think the miniseries is fine AS A STAND ALONE STORY. But as a faithful, accurate representation of the storyline, it has many failings.
One of my key disappointments is with the character of Paul. As much as you can complain about Lynch and his doings (and I do have my complaints there too), you have to agree that Paul is extremely well done. His character is right in line with the book, and as Paul is the CENTRAL character, that's rather important. Paul is NOT a whiny, spoiled brat in the beginning of the book. He is mature, intelligent, and able to stand up to the Reverend Mother. I can see that SciFi wanted to show Paul's ""maturation"" but they didn't need to demolish his character in order to do it. I cringe every time I watch the first half of the SciFi miniseries, and what they did to Paul and some of the other characters.
The sets and costumes are sometimes pretty, sometimes ugly. You can argue either way, you can argue that asthetics don't really matter. But again, they were made from a ""Star Wars"" point of view and NOT from a Dune point of view. There were wide open windows on Arrakis!! This would never have been permitted. The stillsuits were a complete joke. The overriding, overwhelming concern of everyone on that planet was water conservation. Stillsuits were meant to keep you from dying. In the miniseries it seemed like you were at a beach and sure, you might get thirsty, but so what. In the book the lack of water and its constant conservation was a KEY element, it was in fact pretty much a character just as important as Paul or Jessica.
I can see why the miniseries would appeal to people who didn't know about the books. It's like Star Wars - a great, engaging tale with interesting characters. And again, if it had been billed as ""an adaptation"" I would have taken it in that sense and enjoyed it. But it is NOT true to the books, and those of us who find great meaning in the books can see that meaning being twisted or lost in this adaptation. If nothing else, the SciFi release has renewed an interest in the books of Dune and its ecology and messages. I would recommend that anyone who finds the concept of Dune even slightly interesting to definitely READ THE BOOK and then watch the miniseries with that background in mind.",1048032000,6,3011,4.536764705882353
1391150,2,B000053V8F,"I'm one of the few people who cannot bash David Lynch's dark and dramatic film, especially the 190 version of that monumental film. I did get excited when I heard that the Sci-Fi Channel was doing a new miniseries based on the Frank Herbert novel. I could only sit through the first three hours before I decided not to watch any more. I always thought of Herbert's novel as dark, but this miniseries is anything but. It has some great visual effects and some fine fight sequences. But this version's gripping story of murder, revenge, love, religion and political intrigue is lost in a mishmash of horrifying costumes, lousy set designs, bright scenery and horrible acting. The only good performance in the film is that of the planet Arrakis, or Dune. Watch the David Lynch film instead of this horrible waste of time and energy. At least Lynch's film has character ""oomph"" thanks to a fine cast (Unlike this piece of ...). Grade: D-",1047945600,,933,4.695121951219512
1391161,4,B000053V8F,"David Lynch's 2-hour feature film (later extended to 3 hours) and John Harrison's 6-hour TV miniseries each have very different interpretations of Frank Herbert's masterful sci-fi novel ""Dune"".  Separately, neither effort adequately captures Herbert's vision of humanity and struggles for power in the far distant future; but each work brings varying degrees of depth to the screen, giving the viewer a glimpse of what Herbert envisioned.
Strengths of Harrison's TV miniseries interpretation:
* Better character development: especially Duke Leto Atreides (William Hurt), Princess Irulan Corrino (Julie Cox), Padishah-Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV (Giancarlo Giannini) and Stilgar (Uwe Ochsenknecht).
* A more comprehensive telling of the story: including the Corrino family, the ordinary lives of the Fremen, the ties between the Harkonnen and Atreides families, and the influence of the Bene Gesserit.  Strangely, Paul is never called Usul.
* Better special effects and panoramic views, except for the often-used surrealistic lighting.
* Little use of stock footage scenes, which was often used by Lynch.
Strengths of Lynch's feature film interpretation:
* Better costumes overall, especially the all of the uniforms and Fremen stillsuits, which, unlike the TV miniseries, looked as if they would actually work.
* Better portrayal of the Mentat.
* Hearing the thoughts of the characters added an extra element.
* Better acting overall: especially Lady Jessica (Francesca Annis), Baron Harkonnen's doctor (Leonardo Cimino), Shadout Mapes (Linda Hunt), Paul 'Muad'Dib' Atreides (Kyle MacLachlan), Baron Harkonnen (Kenneth McMillan), Duke Leto (Jrgen Prochnow) and Gurney Halleck (Patrick Stewart).
Someone who hasn't read Herbert's novel and only sees Lynch's feature film may not understand the story, but someone who hasn't read the novel but only sees Harrison's TV miniseries will probably understand the story without difficulty.  Anyone who has read the novel and sees either live-action interpretation will probably be disappointed to some degree by both, but each one can be appreciated for what each brings to the screen.  The acting from Alec Newman as Paul 'Muad'Dib' Atreides was by no means perfect in the TV miniseries, but did shed a different light on the character from Kyle MacLachlan.
Overall, I give Harrison's TV miniseries version of ""Dune"" a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.  It is interesting to speculate how David Lynch would have added more to his film if he had been able to create a more comprehensive piece like the TV miniseries, as well as use CGI special effects and the best actors from both. Clearly, each screen interpretation shows what each director was able to accomplish with his available resources and artistic license.",1047945600,158,2752,5.465882352941176
1391162,3,B000053V8F,"I've seen both the original David Lynch version of Dune as well as the extended version and found them to be quite good, so I bought the Sci-Fi Channel miniseries on tape with high expectations which were, for the most part, not met.  For one thing, it seems that director John Harrison can't direct his way out of a paper bag--the pacing of the scenes is so far off in some parts that I found myself having to drink an entire pot of coffee in an effort to stay awake through it.
Another issue that concerns me is the casting in this miniseries.  William Hurt, while a fine actor in most of his other films, simply did not have the spark and passion needed to play Duke Leto.  His lines were delivered in such a wooden manner that I thought an Egyptian mummy could have done a better job than he did.  Saskia Reeves wasn't much better; her Lady Jessica had no life at all, and seemed to be little more than animated set dressing.
The supporting cast of Frank Herbert's Dune were the one saving grace of this miniseries.  Alec Newman delivered an excellent performance as Paul Muad'dib Atreides, the future mahdi of the Fremen, and Barbora Kodetova was a good choice for the role of Chani, Muad'dib's Fremen concubine.  Ian McNeice's Baron Harkonnen was wonderfully decadent and evil, as was Matt Keeslar in the role of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen and Laszlo Imre Kish as Glossu Rabban.  I thought that Uwe Ochsenknecht did a passable job as Stilgar, the Fremen naib who helps Paul to discover his destiny, and PH Moriarty was the most enchanting Gurney Halleck I've ever had the pleasure to watch.  Julie Cox as Princess Irulan Corrino was a delight, especially since Irulan got to do more than just stand there.  Young Laura Burton made a stunning debut as Paul's sister Alia, who was born to consciousness while still in Lady Jessica's womb.  In fact, her Alia rivals the one played by Alicia Witt for sheer creepiness.
Once all is said and done, Frank Herbert's Dune is definitely not a miniseries that will be enjoyed by most veteran Dune fans because of the slow pacing, stilted acting by the two main stars, and cheesy costumes that would not look out of place in Rocky Horror Picture Show.  For someone who is being exposed to the world of Dune for the first time, however, the miniseries would be a passable introduction.  Not worthy of an Emmy or Cable ACE Award, but okay nonetheless.",1047945600,4,2388,4.592941176470588
1391163,1,B000053V8F,"It was through IMDB I discovered a new series (children of dune)set to premiere soon on the sci fi channel. I watched the trailer and was instantly inspired to read these books before it unraveled itself onscreen. I have now only read ""DUNE"" and I really liked it. What I then discovered was that there was a mini series of Dune already released and watched it. And let me tell you I couldn't believe how patheticly different it was from my own imagination.
Here I read this book which is pouring with philosophical details, taking its reader through a psycologicly and physically  enlightening process (bhuddistic in many ways). The main character ,Maud'hib, is supposed to be a traine and soon to become master of elementary and universal knowledge. I thought now that YOGA and KARATE have become such mainstream religious sports, one ought to know it has alot to do with living in harmony with the world and its elements. THIS is the approach I felt from the book during paul's training. I was HORRIFIED when ""onscreen"" it all was totally plastic and too high-tech. As I remebered it, the time in which the story is set the people were moving away from that.
ONE of the key moments in the book of describing what a dry desert hell-planet Araakas really is IS when Paul is sitting in the training room on CALADAN and one of his mentors explains the conditions of the desert planet while its raining outside. It gives the moment a contrastic unconscious message. THIS SCENE WAS NOT EVEN INCLUDED ONSCREEN!
I know its not easy to adapt a book into film and that means leaving pieces out. WELL, it is finding these key moments in the book that seperates good directors from bad ones. I felt that this tv adaption had absolutely no feeling no intesity no intrigue. Alot of this has to do with the bad casting aswell. I agree with one of the reviewers here saying that you couldn't tell most characters apart from the other. Feyd-ruath is supposed to look like a pale dark-eyed evil adolscent. Someone the likes of Jaquin Phoenix would have suited that part much better.
In the beginning of the series when seeing Jessica and Paul, I almost laughed my head off. They looked like they had come right out of the 70's ""Starwars"" only without acting skills. The reverend mother was a chiep ""fifth element opera singer"" attempt, while the whole harkonnen scene looked like one nauciously bad MaCBETH play in red filter. The only character that didn't lack facial expression was Leit-Kynes'. Everyone else looked like expressionless catwalk models. How can someone make such a bad choice when evidently paul (with all the things going on in his head) should have the expression of the century. And that expression is not the indifferent one such as Alec Newman tried.
The scnenery looked chiep. We don't wanna look at adjusted paintings, if Dune calls for a desert then go out and film THE DESERT.
I don't really understand when people say that the costuming was any good. Sure, one needs a grave imagination to create such ugly costumes. I on the other hand would think it more beautiful not to mention believeable if the costumes were a LITTLE MORE simple and toned down looking a little more earthly. ONE must not forget that the secret to the heart of the viewer is to make them relate, which is hard to do with looking at costumes that won't even get through the door. I KNOW, I KNOW it's sci-fi but that does not mean it is to become a HIGH-tech dollhouse. One might aswell have painted the furniture on the wall! And indeed the characters were as expressionless as dolls.",1047513600,4,3569,4.6561014263074485
1391164,1,B000053V8F,"I wanted to love this. I admit that adapting Frank Herbert's masterpiece is an incredibly daunting task, but for TWO films to completely miss the mark is unforgivable given the power and majesty of the text.  Besides the surprisingly bad production and art design [not to mention costume work], this film manages to drain any and all tension or interest out of the tale.  One of the biggest shortcomings of the Lynch version is the length:  a story so large cannot be told so quickly.  Harrison simply didn't know what to do with the lavish running time he was given.
The underlying problem here is a screenplay that is faithful to the plotline but not to the themes.  Opting to omit the voice-over narration concept, Harrison *tries* to blend the internalized thoughts of the characters into dialogue.  Not a good idea when the book is almost entirely made up of internalized narration.  Somewhere in the transfer, the resonance was lost.  The importance and the urgency were lost, along with the characters.
This mini-series is flat, boring, and ugly to look at.
This is a film that should look like 'Lawrence of Arabia', not an episode of Xena.  Bad as it looks, the budget isn't to blame.  Maybe they could have cut down on the superfluous Irulan spaceship scenes and Harkonnen hot tub goofiness and shot the exteriors in an ACTUAL DESERT, not a ten-foot soundstage.  For God-sakes its called DUNE for a reason, much of the tone and power of the book comes from the hostility and absolute desolation of the location.
Dune.  Arrakis.  Desert planet.
They spent so much time designing the intricacies of their palace bedrooms and courts they forgot what was important.  The lighting is gaudy and embarrassing [ease up on the color gels, bucko], the end scene looks like a bad Cirque de Soliel parody, and the cinematography is sad and uninspired.
This one makes me want to watch Lynch's version again, not that I liked that one either.

Nevermind the special effects aren't up to full-blown Hollywood CGI standards. The producers and, especially John Harrison, make do with what they had, and the result is a bold vision that is a worthy compliment to one of the greatest sci-fi epics of all time.
Imagine yourself witnessing the Dune saga as if you were watching it performed on a stage, in a post-Atreidean time (just like the Globe Theater patrons would watch Henry IV or Julius Caesar). Dune is, after all, a Shakespearian drama, and by confining it to the ""stage"", Harrison and company challenge your imagination.
The script succeeds where so many adaptations fail: remain true to the logic and ideas of the story, and never sacrifice characterization for the sake of plot momentum.
The art direction (especially the costumes and set design) are simply stunning. The acting is only over-the-top where necessary (and expected, as in the Baron Harkonnen), or subtle and subdued (Duke Leto) as befitting the rigid social order that bound humans in the pre-Atreidean era.
I never saw the series on television (don't have cable), but rented it once it was available on VHS. After I bought my DVD player last year, this was one of my first, essential purchases.
If you haven't read the novel, please do so first. You won't be disappointed.

1391168,4,B000053V8F,"I have never read Dune or any of the accompanying books. When I first seen the regular version on the Sci-fi Channel I was a bit confused. A few of the scenes didn't make much sense and I was left missing the overall moral of the story in itself.
Essentially, the story begins with Atriedes family and the numerous political intrigues revolving around the production and gathering of spice, an essential element in the universe (sort of like oil). Duke Leto Atriedes is sent by royal command of the Emperor of the Universe to take control of the spice production on the barren planet of Arrakis. Once the family, which includes the Duke's concubine and his son, arrive on the planet. A plot to overthrow them is soon hatched by the Duke's enemy, the Harkenon family.
The plot succeeds and the Duke is killed. Paul Atriedes, the Duke's son, and his mother the concubine are sent helpless into the desert.  They soon find help from the battle harden Fremen. The Fremen are a tribe of warriors who are awaiting the coming of a Messiah to end their long and fruitless struggle against Harkonen and the Emperor. It becomes clear very quickly that Paul is that Messiah.
Through a wierd ritual of mysticism and fanatic religious devotion, Paul quickly transforms himself into Mau-dib, or Messiah. He begans leading the Fremen in a fight to retake Arrakis and defeat his father's enemies.
The director's cut is over 30 minutes longer then the version shown on Sci-fi. There are a lot of added scenes and some scenes are enhanced from the original version. This version does provide a little more scope and background to the characters, yet, it doesn't really change the story. Had I not done any research into the books and the story of Dune itself. I would still be as confused as ever.
I haven't read the books, nor have I seen the Lynch version. I am therefore a virgin watcher/reader of Dune. To be honest, I really liked the movie. I thought the special effects were good, and the acting was too bad either. To be honest, the movie inspired me to read the books, which any good movie based on a novel should.

1391169,4,B000053V8F,"After reading the reviews here I was torn between buying this DVD or just forgetting it. I chose to purchase it.
Although 288 minutes of film is considerable time to get things across Dune is a dense book filled with intrigue, politics and religious philosophy. David Lynch created a weird and wild universe for Dune and failed miserably as far as plot went. Still it was enjoyable to watch and he made House Harkonnen more interesting than House Atreides. In John Harrison's version we get a balanced look along with more of the religious and political wrangling.
William Hurt plays a quiet, almost Gary Cooper like reluctant leader. Many of the notions of a Star Wars/Star Trek hero are unwarranted. This isn't Hurt's finest acting but it's not bad and he get's the point across. Alec Newman's petulant, spoiled child isn't all that bad a decision. We need to see he grows up and matures quickly and out of necessity. The first disc is a lot of exposition that is still interesting to watch. In disc two we see the processes and driving forces behind the Fremen and Bene Gesserits (also with the word witch attached as invective) along with The Spacing Guild. That makes six sets of people, including The Emperor we have to be familiarized with which Harrison pulls off to his credit.
Beyond the big cast of important characters and politics there is quite a lot of backstory to make up for which happens on the 2nd DVD where we learn about Fremen culture and it's religious beliefs which prohpecises the coming of Muad'Dib, the messiah from another world. We find that this prophecy is probably true.
By disc 3 we see preparation for holy war and more cultural issues as Paul/Muad'Dib gets his people ready for war.
Now throw in a culture similar to Middle Eastern cultures with more than a fair shot of Muslim themes to the story line and we have a film that tells the story decently but also manages to put a spin on different ways of life and like it or not cultural relativism.
Harrison doesn't get off the hook for some poor sets. I'm sure the desert is difficult to shoot but when you see wind whipping around people's faces and the background is a still shot of land the continuity can break the otherwise good suspension of disbelief he keeps throughout the film.
There is too much in Dune to ever get right and Dune is one of those books that everyone who has read it has a certain idea of what it's universe should be about. My view of the Dune universe differs but not enough to let it get in my way of enjoying a well crafteted film on a television budget. Some of the acting seems bland but at the cost of exposition and plot which is something acceptable to me.
I would advise checking this version out. I liked the David Lynch film which is vastly different and visually more interesting but I enjoyed this production for it's better storyline and intrigue over action.
The features on the DVD are worth watching and are informative. Between that and the modest price it is worth checking out.",1045872000,,3011,4.567467652495379

They appeared to practice the muslim religion, wore Arab garb.... no still suits! Just traditional Arab dress. The acting was want, with the exception of the costuming the entire effort was a miss. They had a lot more time to address the scope of the book, but missed this opportunity and dumbed down a terrific story. Maybe they were playing to a more adolescent audience.

This installment is more true to the book than the movie. But the settings, the overall experence falls short. The costumes are creative, but some are a bit clownish, like the sardaukar ones. Are they soldiers or players in a renaicence fair? One thing I lked very much of the Linch movie was the costumes, in that regard they did their job. Their soldiers looked like...well, soldiers.
One thing I did not liked specially in the miniseries was the disregard for water. Why oh why did they put the fremen walking in the open, with windows to the open desert? playing, and talking and living in a place that its supposedly, the closest thing to hell on earth.
Overall I liked the movie better. The acting was better. The scenary was better. The special efects were better. I mean, they can make a full motion picture now, all in a computer. I expected better f/x.

The acting was flat almost all around. I was sorry to see William Hurt in this as I find him to be a good actor, but nothing he could have done would have saved this haphazard attempt to recreate Frank Herbert's brilliance. Again I recommend Lynch's interpretation. It's a bit bizarre in places but reflects well upon the book. Of course if you haven't done so, read the book and you'll know.",1045267200,4,814,4.821428571428571

1391195,3,B000053V8F,"I have to thank another reviewer for the Shakespeare meets Tremors idea, but as I was watching Paul ride the sandworm, it made me think of Tremors.  What if Kevin Bacon could have been cast as Paul Atreides?  Never mind...
The 2000 miniseries will forever be compared to David Lynch's 1984 version, as well as the book.  I think we need to realize that comparing a film to a book will bring nothing but disappointment.  Here's my main comparison:  The 1984 version tried to cram too much into a three hour movie, and the resulting edit became practically incomprehensible for those who had not read the book.  The Sci-Fi Channel miniseries version has more time to develop the story, so to me there was much more satisfaction.
The story is about royal houses jockeying for power and control of the desert planet, Arrakis, and the production of Spice, the single most valuable commodity in the universe.  When House Atreides takes over from House Harkonnen, Duke Atreides is soon assassinated and his royal concubine and son are left in the desert.  Young Paul Atreides, skilled in mystical fighting/magic methods, embarks on a hero's journey and meets the people of the desert.  He eventually assumes a messianic role to lead the Fremen in revolution against the Harkonnens.
Positives:
I liked the multi-party political intrigue with the various factions.  The costumes were fantastic, with a European Renaissance feel, with some feudal Japanese thrown in for warriors.  As another reviewer stated, Alec Newman's Paul initially sounds as whiny as Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker in Star Wars IV, but Newman grows with the role and his character is one of the few dynamic characters in the series.
Criticisms:
The special effects were little better than a suped up Star Trek TNG episode.  The navigators in the 1984 version were more mystical, and their role more important.  Also, the Baron was much more disgusting.  There were some weird passages of time too, like Jessica's daughter going from infant to about six years old in a short period.  The same with Paul and Chani's son.  Finally, in the final battle, a mob armed with knives attacks guards with automatic guns.  That's stretching things a bit...
Still, this was an interesting tale and about as close to the book as one is likely to see.",1043798400,3,2297,4.89405684754522

The only problem with it, some of the scenes are clearly low-budget blue-screen, and the complexities of teh different training schools are demarcated by silly hats (instead of , say, red-stained lips for the Mentats, or the Suk doctor mark,  they wear silly hats.) The costumes are otherwise magnificently Renaissance (as opposed to the more Gothic feel of Lynch's Dune). Worth seeing. Worth owning.",1043452800,2,537,5.033707865168539
1391197,2,B000053V8F,"To its credit, this treatment's five-hour running time affords the kind of attention to narrative detail and to *pacing* that Lynch's version lacks. And the cast is pretty good--the main actors give, by and large, their all. The fellow playing Paul is especially good in the final third of the show, during his transformation into the messiah/savior.
Sadly, there appears to have been no budget whatsoever--the special effects are beyond bad, the art direction questionable, the editing, directing (and much of the acting) rote and often sloppy. Even the *dialogue* editing is poor, with bits that were recorded at different times having different timbres than other speech from the same scene.
I was floored when I learned after watching that the cinematographer was none other than Vittorio Storaro, the mastermind who lensed *Apocalypse Now*. How could such a genius have boarded this wreck of a production? If one does the work of mentally separating the cinematography proper from the special effects, it's clear that there's some talent there. But when nearly every shot is an eyesore, what's the point? The money used for Storaro and William Hurt would have been much better spent on additional graphics engineers.
It's one thing for Arrakis's deserts to look imperfect. Deserts are big and vast and incredibly hard to fake, like oceans. But even the scenes filmed in *caves* look like they were shot on a soundstage! And it's not like the actors behave as though they're in a fierce desert. Half the time the characters are out there, they're unbuckling their face masks as they approach, blatantly for the camera's benefit.
The director mentions the show's ""operatic"" qualities in the bonus features, as if the staginess were a strategy he embraced rather than an obstacle he lacked the money or the skills to overcome. The sand worms look great in and of themselves, but forget about believability in any shot showing both worms and people. ""It's the story, not the effects,"" say some. But when you can't tell the story because you don't have the effects, it's a problem. How do the Fremen dismount once they're atop and somehow steering the worms? How close to home can they ride them? For that matter, where do the Fremen keep their 'Thopters? And why does the desert mouse, so small but so important, have to look like a discarded prop from ""Sesame Street""? It's inexcusable. I can *imagine* Arrakis when I read the book. When I watch the movie, I'm looking to *see* it. Period.
You could maybe get away with staging a movie for a Jane Austen drama in which most of the story takes place in a mansion. But not with something of the epic scope of *Dune*, where the landscapes and skyscapes are so central to the story.
The preciousness of water to the characters is practically the only thing in this production that's consistently believable, and movies far too often overlook this kind of verisimilitudinous detail. Yes, I'm glad I saw this DVD, and I'll be watching Harrison's next production, too. But still I must ask: Peter Jackson, where are you?!

I am glad that I rented it and not bought it because I would probably never watch it again. Although they may be good actors, they still fall short of my expectations. They may do well in other movies but in this particular movie the rolls demand sincerity, seriousness, and emotion. I do not think that all the actors and actresses conformed to my standards. One main example would be with Alec Newman. Although he gives an outstanding performance (note the three stars not one) with his beautiful body and thoughtful speech, he could have given a better performance by talking slower and actually pretending to care. This would help it be more like the book because the book portrays Paul as being cautious and unsure of himself and his decisions and unlike the movie's sure, defiant, and self-centered Paul.

1391199,5,B000053V8F,"Production value-wise, this remake of the sci-fi classic ""Dune"" was pretty darned good, and the intentions of including a lot more key scenes from the book than the original David Lynch version of the story are commendable. HOWEVER, there is something DEFINITELY missing from this production and I'd say that it has to be that undefiniable aspect known as ""soul"". The Lynch version had a warmth, a charismatic quality that this version just does not have. The casting is bland at best, with only the characters of Vladimir Harkonnen, Count Fenring and Liet Kynes being done any justice. Gurney Halleck doesn't even have an inkvine scar in this one! And Dr. Yueh STILL doesn't look like he's described in the book. In fact, if you can even discern where Dr. Yueh IS in this production, you're doing better than I am!!

The actors portraying Paul Atreides and Feyd Rautha look entirely too much alike, and Alex Newman, who plays Paul, does NOT have the believable charismatic quality Kyle Machlachlan had! The one TRULY glaring error in casting is William Hurt as Duke Leto. Hasn't this wimp screwed up ENOUGH sci-fi remakes? He stands out like a fire hydrant in the big cat house at the zoo!

However, in its favor, the CHOAM company dinner is in this production, something that was sorely missing from Lynch's version, and Jessica's discovery of the terrarium room is here too. However, a LOT of cues were taken from Lynch's version despite the producer's efforts to make the film look different: for instance, the Guild Highliners look almost exactly like they did in the 1984 production.

All in all. the colors and all are nice, and SOME of the acting is quite good, particularly Ian MacNiece, the guy playing Vladimir Harkonnen, also the one doing Liet Kynes and the guy playing the Count, but Lynch's oddball vision counted for a lot in the '84 version....

1391211,4,B000053V8F,"This rendition of the Frank Herbert masterpiece was much more true to the spirit of the novel than the 1984 Lynch version. Any person who thought the '84 movie superior either didn't read (or understand) the books or has fallen prey to the 1990's 'image' bug. Believe me, image is not everything. It is refreshing to see a director worry about substance as well. Which, in my opinion, should be the primary concern. Sure the '84 movie had more visual impact with better special effects but I thought Harrison did a masterful job when one considers his budget.
Were there problems? Absolutely... Did they ruin the overall effort. No! Aspects of the book that were omitted didn't detract from the overall 'feel' of this series and there was very little that was added that didn't work well within Herberts plot line. The character casting might have been better thought out (Stilgar, Leto especially) but I, unlike many reviewers, actually enjoyed Alec Newman's portrayal of Paul. Yes he may have come off as petulant and spoiled at first but this is because we don't have the advantage of the books 'internal dialogue'. Lynch's production proved that bringing that aspect into a cinimatic forum just won't work. Things happen too fast. Reading the book we can pause and reflect on what the character is thinking but in a movie format doing so just leaves you in the dust and you miss too much. Not knowing what Paul is thinking and judging him on his actions alone makes him appear immature and petulant. He, however, grows up as the series progresses and I feel Newman does a good job developing the character.
An overall good job. I must say, in spite of some problems, I enjoyed this series opener very much. I look forward to the 'Children of Dune' follow-up.",1036454400,5,1762,4.742671009771987
1391212,3,B000053V8F,"First let me say this - I first read Dune in 1973, and still consider it one of the best novels ever written. Frank Herbert's vision of a future is perfect and unflawed by the common focus of science-fiction upon technology - Herbert by contrast puts his book firmly in the minds of his characters. If you haven't read it, I highly recommend doing so.
When I saw the mini-series DVD I was pretty excited. I always felt that the David Lynch movie did not do justice to this greatest-of-books. I purchased it on the spot, and set aside a weekend to enjoy it to the fullest.
It does have some bright spots, to cover first. The coverage is much better this time out - nice development of the plot, no strange devices being manufactured to speed things along, development of Feyd (the guy who could have been emperor).
However, there are some pretty damaging aspects here as well.
Paul, the hero of this story, is portrayed by some petulant chip-on-the-shoulder, whining little brat of an actor. This is the man who would send a Jihad across the entire universe? This is the one who would discover the very meaning and significance of presience? This actor was such a horrid choice that it continually interferred with my ability to enjoy the movie.
Lady Jessica, the heroine and very shaper (and manipulator) of bene gesserit breeding, is portrayed by someone who should be selling biscuits in a Hugh Grant film. Some of her lines had me rolling on the floor, she was so terrible, and so utterly unbelievable.
Stilgar? How'd you get so chubby out in the desert? How on earth did you become so lethargic? You were supposed to be tall, lank, wiry, and very dusty. You embodied the fremen in the book, the defacto desert warrior you are. Instead, you look like the chef on a cruise ship Oh and Channi. My goodness she was terrible. I realize she may have been struggling with the English language, however all of her lines were so tortured that I would wince when she would speak. No wonder they didn't even cover her on the casting notes. Undoubtedly she has returned to her day-job.
BAD CASTING!
Now I realize that it is expensive to get good cinematographers, and rent the panavision equipment, but alot of this has to do with art direction and lighting as well. But this part lacked continuity the most. Some scenes, like the banquet, were shot wonderfully. Others, like everything in the desert, or the seitches, was just awful. The cheesy lighting gave away the cheap sets, the plasticity of the still-suits, the painted backgrounds.
Overall, one is left with the feeling of television. Now, on the other hand, I must admit that this is probably the finest television out there. Of course, from my point of view, television is awful anyway (haven't owned a tv since 1981).
I give it 3 stars for trying to stick to the story, and trying to have some character development.
However, when I come to the last problem of the movie, I fear I am really overrating it.
William Hurt is the most wooden superficial character actor of all time. Casting him as Leto was laughable. People would be willing to die for this guy? His son would seek vengance on a universal scale for this guy?
The David Lynch film is rife with problems - a demonic baron Harkonen, a nearly non-existant Feyd, huge gaps in the story, funky technology not in the book, but after viewing it immediately after this mini-series, we all had to agree it was a far superior film, despite its brevity and deviations from the story.

1391214,1,B000053V8F,"Frankly, I'm amazed by the good reviews this has garnered. All I can really say is: yech!
Say what you will about Lynch's attempt, at least the acting was well done. In retrospect Kyle MacLachlan was amazing and if anyone doubts Jurgen Prochnow's Leto over the stiff semi-conscious version offered by Hurt they need to get their head examined.
The attraction of a mini-series is the ability to play out the arc of dune while giving the viewers time to digest what is happening-this version doesn't even address the concept of the Butlerian Jihad or Msentats-both integral features of the book, nor does it give more than a passing treatment to the problems and curses of prescience-which is the very crux of the ENTIRE story arc.
That being said, the very poetics of this effort are flawed. Paul, who by all accounts of the book is a leader of the very first rank, comes off as a petulant and whiny teenager-the Fremen, who are basically described as ""death on wheels"",;an amalgamation of Texas Rangers and ninjas-come off as incompetents-Heck! Stilgar-the tall desert warrior of the book-has become a short fat guy.
HUH?
This version takes all of its advantages and lets them slip without a moments thought. The story arc isn't even faithful to the book-so what exactly is the point?
Sadly enough-the cast is incredible vis-avis talent-but it is easily apparent to anyone who has read the book that they haven't the foggiest notion of what the hell the books were about.
All I can assume is: bad direction.
This was a waste of my time and it will be a waste of yours. Stick to the books. If you want a good visual reference then watch Lynch's version: better effects (ucch-this one looks like it had effects done by a five year old with a digital effects prog.) incredible costuming (the stillsuits in this look as if they were made of paper) and decent to incredible acting(Brad Dourif plays Piter in the Lynch version-the guy in this-ucch.).

Almost every site that I've seen by critics or whatnot have utterly trashed this rendition of Frank Herbert's classic novel.
Harrison did the best job be could with the money he could, and I don't think anybody could have done any better with an unlimited supply of money, apart from better special effects.
But special effects are NOT the most important part of a film, the storytelling is.  People these days are too interested in if a movie ""looks"" good, than if the movie was expertly told and acted.
People say that the performances in Dune by Hurt and Newman were wooden.  I say read the book, forget Lynch's monstrosity, and watch Harrison's again.  Duke Leto is supposed to be, he's depressed up until he dies.  He's just left his home on Caladan and is forced onto a hell planet by the emperor who he thinks is plotting against him.
Newman's portrayal of Paul Muad'Dib is fantastic.  He grows up as the film progresses from the spoiled rich kid to the new messiah.  Newman's performance was perfect.  You could utterly believe what was happening.

1391216,5,B000053V8F,"When SciFi came out with the miniseries ""Dune"", it was a huge improvement over David Lynch's ""Dune"" (which wasn't a bad movie in my opinion).  With a miniseries, one has more time to do justice to the original story.  When SciFi put out that DVD, it was a good one.  So why get this new release?
First, this DVD contains an additional 30 minutes of footage not in the previous DVD or shown on SciFi.  This footage is spread over the three-disks containing the three episodes.  The additional footage adds some more depth to the characters and story and makes this DVD fall even closer to the original novel.  Also, Princess Irulan Corrino's part is expanded even more here.  While she didn't play a real part in the original novel, I liked how her character was given things to do.  This allowed for the political intrigue to play out better.
The down side for me on this DVD set is the brief nudity that appears.  It wasn't shown in the original show or DVD set and isn't needed now.  However, with the way movie makers love getting women to display their breasts in the name of ""art"" (and to make extra bucks from [excited] guys), I guess I'm not surprised. However, this wasn't enough to make me knock down the rating a notch.

1391218,4,B000053V8F,"David Lynch's Dune first came out in theaters around the same time as 2010 (I enjoyed this as a kid).  The reviewers hated it, and I never saw it.  Years later, network TV showed a ""director's cut"" of Dune which added about an hour's worth of material back onto the original Dune.  I hear that Lynch disavowed this cut.  Maybe he preferred his original cut, more than 6 hours before some stupid producers cut it into such a sad mess.  I did watch the ""new"" 3 hour TV version and I liked it very much!  Now, I've just bought a DVD of the Sci-Fi Channel's 4 1/2 hour take on Dune.
My feelings?  Well, the SFC's Dune is longer and therefore has more time to develop the characters and the plot.  It's easier to follow and is more faithful to the letter of the original novel.  It's even a little risque (woah!).  BUT...it also showcases bland TV production values, like obviously staged sets (you can see the seams on the curtain posing as the desert...hah!).  Special effects are nothing special (the navigator scene is cool, though, as are most worm signs).  Cinematgraphy is somewhat neat, with really colorful design (looks like Dick Tracy...same cinematgrapher, too!).  The direction feels very workmanlike, with little sense of awe or true wonder.  One might say...it's like watching Harry Potter but with lesser production values - good, but not really magical.
Acting is up-down.  The UP  - Alec Newman is fair enough as Paul Atreides, Saskia Reeves is quite good as his mother, Julie Cox is majorly desirable as the Princess (ignored pretty much in the Lynch version), and European hottie Barbara Kodetova melted my TV set as Channi (dull-so-dull Sean Young frozed it right back in Lynch's version).  The DOWN - anyone from the Harkonnen family (yawn - I almost prefer Sting in his red diaper in Lynch's version), the Emperor (who is this frumpy fellow?  Santa Claus?  Please give me the Lynch version), William Hurt as Paul's father (well, he wasn't really bad, just kinda dull, I preferred the Lynch version which had the captain of ""Das Boot"" as the father, way cool).  Bottom line, the SFC's Dune is a competent, faithful re-telling of this classic tale but nothing magical.
As for Lynch's extended 3-hour Dune, it is GLORIOUS but a total MESS.  Cinematography is amazing, the special effects have that ooo-ahhh wowness to them.  Costumes are quite wicked indeed.  And Lynch filmed many scenes outdoors.  In a real desert.  So the film does not look so artificial.  Hey, it's even got Patrick Stewart and many nice battle scenes!  All in all, there is a true sense of grandeur and artistry in Lynch's version that is absent in the SFC one.
What's the messy part?  Well, the plotline is totally trashed, even with an extra hour.  It's like watching SFC Dune on fast-forward.  Having seen both Dunes and read the novel, I could follow the plot, but the novice viewer might be hopelessly lost.
Bottom line - I will take Lynch's flawed version for its beauty and awe but SFC's version for its plotline and seriously fine actresses.  But DON'T buy the current Lynch DVD; that's the original 2-hour version, which is sure to be totally incomprehensible.  Do buy the SFC special edition Dune (that's the one with all the special features), and wait until someone comes to their senses and releases an extended version of Lynch's Dune (I hear it's available in Japan but not here...booo).",1028505600,4,3390,4.751712328767123

They may relay many of the events but the ""straightforward"" filming technique cut out entirely the mystique that makes the original film version and the book such a cult classic!  It would be like downplaying the reality of magic in The Lord of the Rings simply because ""magic"" of that sort isn't popular.  I really don't think that they have anything to build on in any sequels as those are largely based in the religion established in the first book/movie.  Finally, how they ever hoped to create as memorable and endearing a cast as the first film, I will never know.  In short, while the original film has its faults, it captures the spirit of the books.

Jessica was portrayed as weak and mediocre, where in the book she was strong-willed and determined, cold and manipulative.  Frank Herbert wrote Paul with a strong sense of loyalty and duty that he learned from his instructors, and he only continued to learn these things from the people he encountered on Arrakis.  He was bewildered by the destiny fate had chosen for him, but eventually embraced it.  He was personable and charismatic, and disappointed once his ""godhood"" came to light and his friends became worshippers.  In this movie, Paul merely appears to be a whining, petulant child, with none of the charisma a leader needs to sway the masses.  Duke Leto in this movie was such a massive disappointment I didn't mind when he was killed.  When I read the book, he had aspirations of one day becoming Emperor.  He was a strong charismatic leader who inspired great loyalty from all who knew him.  This was hinted at in the movie, but he mainly came across as a man who wanted to be voted most popular by buying people off.  The only characters who seemed to remain true to the book were Baron and Feyd Harkonen.  The rest seemed like androids trying to pretend to be the characters they were protraying.....and failing miserably, and that's why I gave this only 3 stars.  Yes, poetic license is allowed, but please be a tad more realistic.....No one is going to follow an arrogant whiny brat into the greatest battle ever known!  None of the characters lived up to the richly interesting people that kept me engrossed in the book(s).  I don't blame the bad character rendition on the actors, because anyone could see they were doing the best they could with what they were given.  The character development could have been so much better if the screenwriter had actually READ the book(s), which I feel wasn't so.
I didn't mind the unknown actors. They were all obviously talented.  However, I have to ask why they didn't find equally talented actors who didn't have such strong accents?  No offense, but this made following the dialog very difficult at times.  I spent quite a bit of time saying, ""huh, what did he/she say?"".  I do hope that in the rumored sequels, they find actors that speak the dialog clearly (even if it is spoken woodenly)....or at least that they have closed captioning.
I guess I'm very different from most viewers.  To me, the story and dialog are more important than the special effects, setting, and costuming.  The special effects weren't so glaringly bad that they offended me (except for the desert mouse and I did find it offensive to see a cartoon mouse in this movie...if you're going to go that far, why not put Mickey Mouse in?).  I do agree with the reviewers who said that the outdoor scenes would have been more realistic if they had been filmed in the actual desert, but hey, I didn't really notice until they pointed it out to me.  And personally, I could care less what kind of elaborate costume the Princess Irulan wears!  (Another character that is totally different from the books).
Having read all the Dune books, I can honestly say no one will ever be able to make a movie that will capture all the subtleties of the book, all the subplots, and cultural significance.  But this movie comes closer than any that have come before.  This one at least resembles the book, where the other was so shockingly different I didn't recognize it as coming from Frank Herbert's wonderful book.",1025913600,2,3517,4.698205546492659

I had to read the books to find out what the movie was all about.
I did submit to temptation, and bought the movie, and I enjoyed all 5 hours. This is a directors cut-special edition package, 5 hours of movie, divided into 3 disks, but this was the first time I had watched this version of the film, so I don't know what scenes were added, what was different, etc.
From what I can recall of the books, this movie seems to have religiously stuck close to the book.

1391243,5,B000053V8F,"My brother and I first read Dune when we were twelve, and wrote correspondence to Frank Herbert; he was kind enough to reply. That said, first:Herbert's genius was not only the ability to imagine a complex human universe, but an almost Shakespearean ability to construct prose. The Director's cut confirms that Harrison's efforts are less than an adaptation, and more of an assimilation of Herberts vision. Where are the emotional crescendo's so abundant in the novel? The Duke's declaration ""Here I stand and here I remain!"", Feyd's eighteenth birthday gladitorial kill of a captured Atreides warrior, the death duel between Duncan Idaho (A swordmaster of Giaz) and Sardaukar as Paul and Jessica escape, the triumphial play between the Emperor and Alia, the chess like move and counter move in the discourse between the Emperor and Muad Dib in the climatic final act, The famous Gurney Halleck quotations (""And the people's rejoicing that day was turned to mourning, for they had heard that the King grieved for his son""), the real reason for the Emperor's betrayal of House Atreides, the disclosure that the Spice extends the human life span as an insidious poison. Harrison obviously believes that the viewing public enmasse is too undereducated to comprehend Herbert's excellent command of literarure even though much more accomplished screenwriters like Kenneth Brannagh (Henry V)have succeeded in diluting their source material while maintaining the essence.  In addition, while liberties were obviously taken due to both time considerations and dramatic orchestra, I was a little disappointed to see that Harrison did not take the logical step of amending the emphasis on short knives to long swords, particularly in the climatic final scene.  There certainly was not risk of being criticized for following the Star Wars franchise since Dune is the precursor of George Lucas' ""borrowed vision"".
On a technical note, I've had problems with two DVD sets of this movie; the most recent leads me to suspect memory or system inefficiencies on my computer dvd player while the director's commentary is engaged.",1025136000,,2111,5.261127596439169
1391244,5,B000053V8F,"I have to say that this purchase was (mostly) worth it. Artisan decided to rip-off - er, I mean treat all the fans of the Dune miniseries that debuted on the Sci-fi Channel last year with a *special* 3 disc 'Director's Cut' release. Even though I immediately bought the LAST version that came out on dvd last year, I ended up purchasing this one for the additional footage.
It features 30 minutes of footage cut from the original dvd release. Most of the scenes added to the story. They weren't all directly from the book, but the were pretty relevant to the story as it appeared in this version. There are some expanded scenes with Queen Amidal- I mean Princess Irulan, as she investigates the Emperor's involvement in the fall of House Atreides, A few more scenes in the director's favorite alcove above the main hall in the palace on Arrakis, and a few PG-13/R rated scenes that didn't make it into the Basic Cable version.
I like this version more everytime I see it. Even though there were some elements changed from the story in the book - especially Jessica's more prominent role in the first third of the book, the movie tries to be faithful to the overall spirit of the book. If you've read the book then it's really cool to follow along as different elements of the story are slowly revealed. Many time those elements are reveled visually, rather than using the rather annoying and insistent voice-overs in the David Lynch version.
There are some interesting Special Features, spread out on each of the 3 discs along with each part of the movie. I found myself browsing through them before I watched each new segment. Most are the standard shot-on-video featurettes, plus some picture galleries of the movie and the upcoming Children of Dune mini-series. There's also am engaging panel discussion about science fiction and the future with the writer-director John Harrison, Harlen Ellison, Octavia Butler, Michael Cassutt and inventor Ray Kurzwell. I wanted to see much more of this discussion than was featured here.
Another great piece that wasn't on the first release is an interview with Willis McNelly, the author of the Dune Encyclopedia and a friend of Dune author Frank Herbert.  There's also an audio commentary.",1024963200,,2231,4.825065274151436
1391245,5,B000053V8F,"I wish that when the DVD on this mini-series was first released that it was this Director's Cut version.  I liked this adaptation of the book by Herbert, better than the Lynch movie (and I really liked that movie).  Although made for the Sci-Fi channel, the mini-series was very close to the book.  When I purchased the Director's Cut of the mini-series, I found it to be far superior to the Sci-Fi channel release and the previous DVD.
There's more story (30 minutes more than the ""theatrical"" release), which provides more continuity to the movie.  This is always a problem when someone makes a movie from an epic novel, there's always some part of the story to be sacrificed.  I'll admit this movie is not the definitive adaptation, but I think it is the best version that can be made.
This DVD comes with 3 discs (the previous release only came with two).  This version not only has the extra 30 minutes of story not previously released, there are also more extras (included is a sneek peek of the next production ""Children of Dune"").
I would highly recommend this DVD over the previous two disc version.",1024963200,2,1108,4.627551020408164
1391246,4,B000053V8F,"Why they chose David Lynch for the first film when they needed a David Lean, I do not know. Mistake! Lynch is not a director of epics. This book needed someone who understood how to take an epic novel and boil it down to feature length. I believe the director of this version has done it as good as it is ever going to be done. Of course, the advantage of TV is that you can do a four hour, or more, version of any book. Still, I would not have picked Lynch to direct.
It has been many years since I first read Dune in Analog and later in book form. That might be an advantage when watching this film as I had forgotten much of the details. What I do remember is the political intrigue and the flavor of the novel. That is what this film version captures. The spirit, if not all the details of the book, is here.
The special effects were not bad at all and the expansion of the role of the Princess was a good decision. Perhaps the only real complaints one might have with this version is the choice of a very uncharismatic Alec Newman to play Paul and the use of William Hurt as Leto. Hurt - along with Helen Hunt - must surely be the most over-rated actor around. I can only atribute the choice of Hurt to the fact he has an Academy Award and the value of that award was useful in advertising the film. Fortunatly he is not on film very long.
Never-the-less, I liked the film and would recommend it to any but the diehard Dune fan who wants something that will never be. I recommend you forget the details of the book and just enjoy the film.

I really liked the movie.  I would have sat through the entire 4 hours and 55 minutes of it in one sitting had I not had to go to work the next morning.
I was so enthralled with the movie that I am starting to read the book, something I never do.
Loved the movie, glad I bought it as it's now one of my all-time favorites.  Going to be buying the original and reading the book now.  Looks like Herbert has another fan.",1024617600,,771,4.154362416107382
1391248,4,B000053V8F,"And that is the truth. This miniseries is not without its flaws, but it holds closer to the story than the feature-length movie. There's one review that says that Paul did not have a son in Dune...well, READ AGAIN. Chani and Paul had Leto before the twins, and he was killed by the Sardaukar. Any person who's read the book and is a true fan of Dune would know that!
To the film...there are some incredibly wooden performances. William Hurt's talent is absolutely wasted in what little screentime he has. Alec Newman doesn't shine till ""The Prophet"" and that doesn't happen till the last half hour. And there are some absolute gems...Ian McNiece is a wonderful Baron Harkonnen. His rhyming couplets at first are a bit offcolor, but they get better. Feyd is played well by Matt Keeslar, who doesn't go so far over the top as Sting did. Saskia Reeves shines as Lady Jessica, and Julie Cox is absolutely wonderful as Princess Irulan. I cannot wait to see her role grow in the next miniseries.
The extras are where it's at. The roundtable discussion of Dune is the best part. Another great featurette is Willis McNelly. Absolutely wonderful. The 30 minutes od extra footage doesn't add much to the story, but is still enjoyable to watch.
If you're a fan of Dune, you'll still have a slight bitter taste in your throat. If you're new to Dune, you'll enjoy it. If you're just some sad sap who can't think for themselves, you should just dig a hole, fall into it, and never come out.",1024617600,4,1476,4.573584905660377

1391270,4,B000053V8F,"John Harrison's four hour adaption of Herbert's classic book did much to purge my consciousness of David Lynch's stunted 1984 film. Even with its flaws, ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" is a far better realization of the epic scale and scope of the novel. The new director's cut, with thirty plus minutes of new footage, corrects some of the original's problems, adding more layers to the plot and expanding the roles of some supporting characters (especially Yueh, who now receives more than a glorified cameo); in doing so, the story gains greater coherence and momentum. However, a word of advice: Read the book before you watch it--Harrison and company have made a film largely for the fans that assumes you have some familiarity with the Dune saga.
Unfortunately, the biggest problems with the original cut--William Hurt's somnatic performance (even more petrified than in ""Lost in Space"") and a lack of energy from Alec Newman in the lead (though he's decent enough in the more contemplative moments)--are still here. Also, much of the poetry and philosophy of the book were lost in the adaption; still, such intangibles (such as inner dialogue and insinuation) are hard to capture in a film. The focus here is on the essentials of Herbert's plot, a story of politics, religion, and ecology that feels even more relevant these days. I was also delighted to see the Bene Gesserit's manipulation of the Fremen worked into the story--and how Paul transcended it. There's also been some grief over the expanded role of Princess Irulan; certainly, she's more involved here than in the book, but Harrison uses her as a physical representation of the plotting and scheming so prevalent in the novel, effectively binding a handful of plotlines to one person in perfect position to to act (in very subtle ways) on the knowledge she's gained. (And those who have read ""Dune Messiah"" know she's perfectly capable of scheming and manipulation). Personally, I liked her expanded role.
Good direction (from veteran TV director Harrison), better than average special effects, and simply sensational production design help make up for the film's difficulties. Production designer Miljen Klakovic and Oscar-winning costumer Theodor Pistek have crafted a fantastic realization of Herbert's world, bringing it to living, breathing life--the sets (especially the Emperor's palace on Kaitian) and costumes are terrific; each world and setting almost perfectly realized. The only flaws are in the desert settings--obviously a combination of sets and matte/CGI backgrounds--are likely due to budget restraints. Also notice, if you will, the moon that never moves. The CGI work on the sandworms is nicely done, and although the effect isn't completely convincing, it still works. Another asset--great cinematography from legendary Oscar winner Vittorio Storaro.
The DVD extras are pretty well done, the best being the sci-fi roundtable discussion concerning the relevance of ""Dune,"" and the interesting featurette discussing the religious symbolism of the epic series.
All in all, flaws and all, this is a pretty decent version of the classic story. Certainly, it won't satisfy all ""Dune"" fans, but the essentials are here; personally, I can't wait to see ""Dune Messiah"" and ""Children of Dune"" from the same creators.",1024272000,2,3289,5.278625954198473
1391271,1,B000053V8F,"I'll make this short.  This version of the Dune saga is touted as a more accurate rendition of Herberts vision.  It is not.  How can it be more accurate when they significantly change the plot?  Any cinematic version of this story should be dark at times.  The Harkonens are sadistic monsters.  They should be portrayed as such.  How can Paul's ""son"" be killed?  He did not have a son; he had twins - a boy and a girl.  His son goes on to be emperor of the universe for the next 10,000 years.  Tough to do if you're dead.",1023926400,5,521,4.171717171717172

Unbeknownst to the new family, the Evil Emperor is awaiting with a huge plot to destroy them once they have accomplished the flow of spice. After that, it's kind of endless. There are battles, desert worms, fierce fighting and strange beings, and the special effects are fabulous. One young boy sees visions in which he is the Messiah of the freaky desert people, come to save their tribe from extinction. I never did figure out if, in the end, he actually fills that role. William Hurt is the new leader, temporarily. He plays a good and solid part, while whoever plays his wife is a bit daft. Star Wars like vehicles traverse the air over the unrelenting dustiness of the desert, but it isn't time for Darth Vader to move over just yet.

1391273,4,B000053V8F,"The Dune miniseries makes many deviations from the novel, but everything has the right feel.  Action scenes take up a relatively small portion of the movie and character development is correctly assigned the highest priority.  The miniseries is willing to slow down for important conversations, but it never loses its momentum.  The use of three episodes allows the viewer to see palace intrigue unfold into deadly traps and all the smaller conflicts build up to the final battle.  The ending has more meaning when a long journey leads to it.
It surprised me, though, that even this new version was barely a summary of the book.  Thufir Hawat and Duncan Idaho were almost left out.  CHAOM and a few other important organizations in galactic politics were entirely ommitted.
A few other gripes:  There were some moments in the dialogue between Paul and Jessica that just didn't work.  Some of the special effects were questionable; particularly a few of the desert backgrounds and especially the little mouse.  I am convinced that no movie can completely capture the grandeur of the book, but these are about all the complaints I can list...  Except that Paul is maybe just a little too cool with his spiky hair.

The good aspects far outnumber the bad.  The palaces of the Corrinos, Atreides, and Harkonnens are portrayed beautifully and the lighting captures the mood of each location.  The casting choices are excellent.  The Baron is his fat floating self, Feyd is dangerous, clever, and conceited, Duke Leto is somber and stalwart to the end,  Jessica is loving and coldly calculating at the same time, and Chani is exotically beautiful.  The audience watches as Paul himself grows from a pampered Duke's son into a battle hardened leader.

The battle scenes, with their close up sword fighting, are a triumph.  The two toughest armies in the galaxy fight to the death and the result is impressive.  The one-on-one duels are even more spectacular.
Even the sound track is well done.  On Dune there is the Arabic theme backed with drums.  In emperor's palace, where blue evening light floods through the windows, there are the pompous strings in the background.  In the red lit halls of the Harkonnens there is a cold metallic sound to set the mood.
 Overall, I was greatly impressed by John Harrison's version.  Though there are some flaws, I see the miniseries as a grand redemption after the abomination of David Lynch's Dune.

It's very simple, if you watch a couple of hours of film, where a gigantic book (I'm not talking about amount of pages here, but depth and complexity of the plot and story) has been squeezed in, having to omit some of the ""explanatory"" parts not having read the book will leave you completely in the dark. The whole deal of political, religious, philosophical, and mental comings and goings, along with the Sci-Fi background, is simply too much to put into one film.
So.. what does this TV version do?.. it turns the book, into a cheap love story, creating character interaction that does not exist in the book, along with completely skipping the parts of the plot, that would have forced the producers to make something more obscure, than this pre-digested let's-make-something-that-sells-and-appeals-to-young-mindless-audiences-who-think-they're-into-psi/fi-because-they-like-spaceships kinda thing.

While holding to the story ""text"" more than the motion picture they failed to adhere to the simplest elements of the story.  Namely the fact that the cast did not appear visually correct.  Paul and his father were not blondes, and their uniforms were definitely not brown as depicted.  Only the emperor's daughter came close to her description and she was entirely overused, taking the dialog meant for other characters.
The movie also portrays the fremen and their sieches incorrectly, showing Fremen outside without still suits, and presenting an open air siech.  We have a Paul who acts as a spoiled brat at the beginning of the film, which itself, the beginning that is, didn't start off well with having the Atreides starship presented as some Star Trek knock off.

i am gald that i gave this mini-series a chance. i agree that it still wasn't perfect and it didn't give us the world described in Herbert's book. however, it was more convincing and coherent as a story itself. however, i think the pace is still a little too slow at times. i think the cinematography, and the art direction/set production compensate the budgetary constraint (relative to filmmaking). the characters can grow and develop gradually and more naturally this time, so IMHO, it was less problematic than the movie-version. as a dune fan, it is a must to your collection.",1022544000,,929,4.886075949367089

The deliciously evil Harkonnens in this film are much easier to take than in the previous David lynch film. Another great plus this version has is the coherency of the battle scenes (the Lynch version war scenes were dark and chaotic). There are however many points where the film taxes your interest and you may find yourself saying ""why don't they shut up and get on with it"".
  Everything is wraped up well in a rousing last half hour, with terrific CGI + live action battle scenes that are completely believeable.
  Acting wise, the cast is OK, with a few odd faces standing out. William Hurt is almost comatose as Leto Atreides (though his screen presence is still undiminished). Alec Newman is a paradox as Paul. His performance actually improves toward the end when he finally settles into the role of the messiah. Other notable names are PH Moriarty as a fine Gurney Halleck and the always welcome Ian McNeice as the Baron Harkonnen. And the commanding Giancarlo Giannini, though in my opinion not as kingly as Jose Ferrer, he still packs a punch with his line ""you do not wish to feel the full effect of my power child!""

The sound is excellent, the sets are excellent, the cast is excellent (although mostly non-moviestar), the cinematography is excellent, the adaptation sticks much more rigidly to the book, and all in all it makes for a valiant attempt.
The biggest problems are the desert scenes, and the CGI's. The series uses 'translighting' - huge posters used as backdrops in Europes largest soundstage, but they look just like that - posters. The CGI's are awesome, but they look just like that - CGI's. The effects in this production stick out as effects, and it's a shame as it kept my eye from what could have been a better attempt than the 1984 movie, but it just doesn't gel.

Lynch was out to tell a messianic epic in 2 hours, and I think he did quite a good job with that.  This version, however, seems to have different aims.  Not higher, not lower; just different.  I think this is actually a reasonably good interpretation of the universe and story of Dune.  I give the crew a lot of credit for interpreting and adapting a difficult work for the screen.
But that's not all there is to it.  Any movie, no matter how well thought-out it is, should not be this PAINFUL to watch.  This movie was extremely poorly executed.  There was no acting.  None.  Just a bunch of people wandering around trying to look stoic and mystical at the same time, while only looking vaguely constipated.  (Note to aspiring directors out there: if you want your characters to be serious/dark/tragic, you can still allow them to have facial expressions.)  Okay, I lied.  Every once in a while, someone looked a little surprised.
Without acting, the character development had to be spoon-fed to us, which I find insulting, and this really compromised the screenplay (which was, for the most part, pretty decent).
The visual effects, while decent for TV, were below even the level set in the 1983 version of the film.  At least it's widescreen, right?

1391294,3,B000053V8F,"If you have read all of the books in the series ""then you would know how I feel"". The power of Frank Herbert's skill is allowing the audience to fill in the gaps. A little freedom to create the caracters in our own minds.
The films fall short of the richness of the text. One annoying area is the Bene Gesserit. If you know anything about the women of the Bene Gesserit, you know they are perfectly composed and in control of their emotions. Why do we continue to portray women in film to be so frail and emotional, almost everything the Bene Gesserit are not.
The film is worth viewing but keep in mind that is does not come close to the detail that the novels employ. If someone were to create a cable television series that would run once a week for a few years, possibly they could touch the richness of the text, but I fear the we lack the acting talent to portray many of the characters as they should be portrayed.
I recommend that you read Dune before you watch any of the films. Then at least you can see why all films will fall short of portraying the novel as written and read.",1020643200,2,1088,4.2105263157894735
1391295,4,B000053V8F,"It's foolish to expect that any cinematic production of a favorite book can ever live up to ANYbody's hopes.  But given the choice between the David Lynch production, with its vastly better acting and casting and somewhat better special effects, and this rather low-budget version (both of which I own), I only now watch this version.  Would that John Harrison had the resources of David Lynch when he made this version.  For the first time, I really believed in an ""ornithopter"": they had a bird-like quality and looked aerodynamically possible.  The ridiculously shaped aircraft in David Lynch's version look like they were designed by some studio model-maker who hadn't a clue what the things were supposed to do.  And what's with the steam craft in the year 10191?  Further, I was always put off by David Lynch's ridiculous ""sound"" weapon which has no foundation in the story whatever.  Even more ludicrous, indeed nauseating, was his vision of the Baron's perversity and those silly ""heartplugs"".  There is no suggestion of such sick imagery in the book, and makes his version seem rather like a punk/sadist nightmare.  In no manner, watching David Lynch's version, will you ever see the real story as it was written.  John Harrison, I felt, portrayed the Harkonnens vastly more accurately.  All things considered, I find John Harrison's version, with all its flaws, to be as near to a ""definitive"" version as is likely to happen.  Flaws I can live with (what movie is without them?), but I like to think that the director at least had READ the book he's filming!",1020124800,4,1568,4.8977272727272725

1391297,3,B000053V8F,"Sometimes miscasting can produce the odd surprise. Case in point, the Vampire Lestat with Tom Cruise. Dune the Miniseries unfortunately cannot make up the gap. As a fan of the last three novels, I was pleased to see a more accurate portrayal of the legendary first book. It does delve deeper into the complex relationships between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen and the all important socioeconomical factors behind the spice. The miniseries also provides a detailed look into Fremen culture, their role in the development of Paul Atreides, symbiotic relationship with the planet Dune, and of course the sandworms. The special effects for a low budget TV series were impressive, in particular the guild navigator and highliner. In comparison with the sandworms in the Lynch movie, these worms are impressive.
Where the miniseries utterly fails is in the miscasting of William Hurt as Duke Leto I and Alec Newman as Paul Atreides. Hurt sleepwalks through the role and depicts a Duke with little charisma or leadership. Half the time, his lines are muttered and the scene where he succumbs to a Harkonnen tranquilizer dart is well...I've seen better acting in adult films. Alec Newman's screen presence though admirable at times leaves us wondering how a spoiled brat could ever have become Paul Muad'Dib. I don't believe Frank Herbert envisioned him to be so petulant and immature.
Gurney Halleck, Jessica, the Baron, Beast Rabban, and Feyd Rautha all come across as quite believable and the actors are to be commended. Duncan Idaho is a shell of the Duncan I imagined and the same can be said of Stilgar and Thufir Hawat.
As a last disappointemt, I always felt the Bene Gesserit played a central role in the story but for some reason their part is bit, to say the least. I don't know what version of Dune that John Harrison read but he is so off the mark in their portrayal that they come across as little more than gossiping geese. Their elaborate headresses and costumes say ostentatious not austere. Nothing about their principles or influence on the central characters is ever examined It's more like they're some kind of fancy girl's prep school.
While the miniseries clearly helps viewers to understand some of the inner working of Dune, Lynch's version comes a lot closer to conveying the mysticism that Herbert origianlly intended. If the two versions could be combined taking the best of both worlds, then most Dune freaks like me would smile and utter a sigh of pure satisfaction.
If the last three novels are ever made into films they should clearly be superior. You have to figure that they'll get better as a result of trial and error.",1019606400,15,2646,4.89532293986637
1391298,5,B000053V8F,"The Complete Story Filmed - I prefer Lynch's art
Dune si a novel written by Frank Herbert. It happens in a futuristic world quite different from ours, yet still very similar in many respects. The story of Dune, although it does not feature many weird creatures,  has something of the stories of Star Wars or of The Lord of the Ring, it really transports you into a different world. You have to figure out what are the civilizations and major players, you may feel lost at the beginning, but that's the charm of the story.
The story was first filmed in 1984 by the famous director David Lynch. It was not complete, and now the author of the story has collaborated with a director to have a fidel, but long (it lasts for hours...) version of the storie in movie format (originally TV series.) The quality of the film, special effects, is very high, higher than Lynch's film which is quite older. Unlike stupidly politically correct movies made in Hollywood, the movie respects the book in featuring an all-European (white race) cast. This has become rare nowadays.
However, when I compare this movie to David Lynch's, I find it too slow, wearisome, lacking unity. And Alec Newman, the actor playing Paul (the Messianic main character)  have the charisma of Kyle MacLachlan in Lynch's film. BTW, I have noted that none of the reviewers has noticed that Mahdib, the prophetic name used in the movie, is borrowed from Islam (Haddith), where it refers to a token or Messiah that will come at the end of the world. There is definitely a strong religious, metaphysical and political inspiration beneath Dune, just as in Star Wars and the Lord of the Rings.
Clearly, the way the underlying ideas, the spirit, are expressed, the flow of events, the acting, etc. are much better in Lynch's version. Lynch's movie is much more charismatic, conveys the pantheistic ideas much better. I used to blame movies that would not quite respect the book they were putting into film. However, comparing those two movies have convinced me that at least in this case, it is better to make strong adaptions for the audio-visual media than the respecting the letter of the written original book media. This full story will be great for the unconditional fans of the book, but as for the cinematographic art, Lynch is more gifted. I still give the movie five stars, as it is still great and enjoyable.",1019174400,3,2373,4.729468599033816

The 1984 version had better acting and costumes and sets. In this version the sets are cheesy with matte paintings to provide backround. The hats in this version look really stupid and the stillsuits don't even look like they would work. The best acting in this version was from Lady Jessica and Alia. The really needed to cast a different Paul and Baron Harkonnen.
The production quality of the one from 1984 was it's downfall, everything was dark, I don't mean dark as in depressing, but dark as in the contrast of the screen. YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING!
Despite all the things that are wrong with this version, the faults are minor and you start to ignore them into the second part. This one is a lot better than the 1984 version, in that version you would of had to read the book to understand anything.

Although this TV Miniseries presented more details as described in Herbert's book than David Lynch's rendition in 1984, I felt strongly that the absolute lack of faithful reprensentation of the main characters ruined this version of Dune.
I also wasn't too crazy about most of the actings with this cast.  A great deal of the characters were of the noble born, namely the Atreides, the Corrinos, and the Bene Gesserits, they should have carried more regal air among them.  The Harkonnens weren't as sinister as what Herbert wrote.  Also, the guild navigator and the ""foldspace"" scenes aren't as powerfully felt as in Lynch's.

Alec Newman who played Paul and Matt Keeslar who played Feyd were for the most part pretty wooden, Matt Keeslar especially, I thought he was going to sprout branches at one point. One cannot help remember the excellent performances from  Kyle MacLachlan and especially Sting in the Lynch version who really stole every scene he was in. In the sci fi version the scenery managed to out act Newman and Keeslar. William Hurt was likable enough but just didn't manage to convey the emotion and passion of his counterpart J?rgen Prochnow in the Lynch version.
The Lynch version has bigger battles, more battles, better music, and better worm effects. The sci fi version is truer to the book although one unforgivable lapse is the death of Thufir during the initial Harkonnen strike. In one pen stroke they managed to ruin the entire film for me. Thufir was one of the most interesting characters in the books and here he is treated like a plodding fool, standing and screaming while bombs and bullets fly about him, master of assassins? Hardly!

The legendary science-fiction novel by Frank Herbert is, of course, by far to complex to be described this short, and the 1983 theatrical film by David Lynch was trashed by many fans of the novel. After seeing this made-for-television disaster of an adaption, maybe they change their opinion. I found the Lynch film to be one of the best sci-fi films ever made - of course it lost much of the substance of the story, but all of the really essential parts made it into the film.
I made it through the television version in one sitting (273 minutes PAL). While adding some scenes of the novel not seen in Lynch's version it still manages to lose BY FAR more of the spirit and story created by the novel than even the theatrical cut of Lynch's film. Not one single actor of the cast manages to match his counterpart in the Lynch version, in fact every new introduction seemed totally ridiculous to me. The script was inferior by far, at every time, and the obvious lack of budget for a story of this proportions can be seen always and everywhere (set designs, costumes, slow pace/lack of action, miscasting...). The special effects (few and far between, and all done by CGI... of course) were fake-looking and simply terrible when compared to the fantastic SFX work in David Lynch's ""Dune"". And gone is the fascinating, powerful music score by Toto... The new score is forgotten the very same moment when the viewing of the film ends.
Ok, that sounds very hard for this new film... at least they tried... To be fair, it somehow still manages to entertain it's audience (at least a little bit), due to the genius of the story it's based on. And the effects scenes, while very CGI-looking, are still beautiful enough to be enjoyable.

1391358,3,B000053V8F,"SPOILERS!

It is with a heavy heart that I write that, once again, an adaptation of Dune fails to live up to expectations.  While overall better than David Lynch's version, there are even some problems with this version that the 1984 film did not have.  The most noticeable of these problems is the fact that the entire mini-series does not feel like a cohesive story, but rather like a collection of scene recreations.  As soon as one is recreated, I can just imagine a group of set-strikers saying, ""Okay, that's over with.  Let's get on with the next one.""

One of the major problems with this approach is that it makes said sequences feel less important than they are.  Take, for instance, the pain box sequence.  Somehow, the meaning of the scene is lost; it just happens and then it's over.  (A lot of this could have to do with the loss of dialogue explaining how the gom jabbar kills only animals and the implications of the fact that Paul passes the test.)  I also felt this way during such sequences as Jessica's changing of the water of life and the scene where Paul learns to ride a worm.

There are also some inaccuracies that are for the worse, such as the scene where Chani cries over the death of Dr. Kynes.  The Fremen do not cry because it is a waste of water, and not placing this emphasis on the sacred nature of water truly detracted from the characterization of the Fremen as a people.  And speaking of Dr. Kynes's death, Herbert gave any filmmaker a perfect device to explain how exactly he dies with the inclusion of Kynes's hallucination of his father, who explains the pre-spice mass just before it kills him.  I'm certain that having Kynes just exclaim ""The pre-spice mass!"" just before it exploded left many who hadn't read the book scratching their heads.

Characters were also unsuccessfully drawn for the most part.  For instance, I didn't even know which character was Dr. Yueh until the scene in which he is revealed as the traitor.  (At least the actor playing him made an effort to seem conflicted about what he was doing in this version.)  I also felt the extension of Princess Irulan's character was unnecessary.  While it was not a bad idea, it took time away from other more important story elements that could have been expanded upon.

I could go on and on, but I'll stop here, so as to save on the length.  While I'm not completely certain that any film adaptation of Dune would live up to my expectations--even if I had complete creative control over it myself--this is most likely the best we'll get.

This new movie in comparison was too clean and well-wardrobed. Too many pastels and soft acting. Being drawn into a movie or show is important to me. I want to feel like I am in their world, not mildly interested so that I see them as just actors playing a part from a script. This movie lacked an inner fire. I prefer my Dune memories of the 1980's movie and the first six books. Now the books are a very detailed, religous hard-scifi set well worth the purchase. I give the first six Dune books a 5 rating.

Even though its newer, the miniseries simply lacks the granduer and scale of Lynch's movie. Watching it is like watching a rerun of Star Trek or Babylon 5 on tv, simply run of the mill.
The original movie brought with it a sense of wonder, of awe, that was fitting to Hebert's vision. It was an epic, which the miniseries sadly lacks.  The score was dull, to say the least, and I missed the voice overs the original movie had, which I felt provided an important insight into how the characters thought and felt, much like how the book overlaid the narrative style with the descriptive.
While it adheres a bit more closely to the book, faults remain many. The still suits in the miniseries are pathetic, looking more like cotton T-shirts. The imagery and backdrops are unexciting, despite the advantage of 15 years of technology over the movie. The worms look better, but the desert scenes look like the sandlot in my backyard!
Overall, I also believe the cast was badly assembled, and did not complement each other. Willaim Hurt was sub par at best, and thats even when I am a fan of his acting. Paul was simply uninspiring, and all the actors were still stuck on a stage...the way its put across, its more like a play than a movie...if u thought Anakin was bad in Phantom Menace, wait till you see the people here.

That having been said, the earlier David Lynch film captured the mystical, dangerous atmosphere of Dune. But it miserably failed to tell the story. It also injected a whole lot of nonsense (campy over-the-top mysticism), and actually diverged completely from the whole point of the story (by Herbert's own admission).
By contrast, the miniseries is on a lower budget, but does away with much of the nonsense and captures the story of Dune much much better than anything else on film. It loses some of the charged atmosphere, and the visuals aren't as stunning. Anyone new to Dune should prefer this movie to the older one for certain.

Costumes: [were bad]. Good point about the new still

Special Effects: in many ways better. especially the spice addiction blue eyes. that was done alot better and actually responded to lighting.
In summary: some great improvements to the original in the story line.

In short, except for the desert scenes (where they have a very obvious wallpaper background), the movie's special effects and props are quite impressive! Unfortunately, most of the characters' acting is WAY below the standard set by Dino de Laurentiis in his Dune version (which by the way I HIGHLY reccommend for all Dune reader fans). Costumes are fairly elaborate, yet overdone. A few important themes in Herbert's book that I realized in neither his book nor the first film was clarified in this one.

Instead of making the miniseries rugid ( a quality that fits Dune) the low budget just made it cheesey.  It was filmed completely on a set with horrible background art where as the first was filmed actually in a desert.  the customes were way overdone in most cases as were the silly northern european accents (this is really obvious in the differences between bene geserit and fremen: in the movie bene geserit actually wear black abas and the fremen have stillsuits that look real and functioning whereas in the miniseries it seems like the costume designer has never even read dune and they wouldn't be the only person on the production crew).  there were somethings that were decent or better.  the barron was actually smart this time but the uglyness and still evilness of the old one was cool plus sting was better as feyd (in fact the original cast is about twenty million times better).  the special effects were ok at parts (worms were cool), cheesy mostly and used far too much.  plus the miniseries was incredibly too long and too boring to watch, whereas the original movie is only slow at the beginning and has an intense ending, the miniseries droned all the way through and it was hard to watch.  basicaly old movie is way better  and if you want to hear me bad mouth the new miniseries some more, email me 'cause, man, i hated this thing, but if you like dune, rent it and see it for yourself.",1001808000,2,1735,4.58252427184466

The Emperor was much more powerful than the original, and very well cast. Princess Irulan was well cast as well, and her character was a bit more in the open than in the book.

1391381,4,B000053V8F,"Since it has appeared well after David Lynch's Film version, the MiniSeries will probably be compared against the film by most viewers.
Overall, it is not as stylish as the film and is more 'gritty' (no pun intended !). However, it does score over the film with a greater emphasis put on the politics and the society(s) involved (ie. Baron Harkonnen is portrayed as not just nasty, but intelligent as well, the Emperor's daughter comes into view more, and the society of the Fremen is shown in more detail).
This is all far more in tune with the book than the Film (although doubtless the fact that the Film is a lot shorter has something to do with this !).
Unfortunately, these improvements are offset by the characterization of Paul (who never truly seems to shine as the lead character) and Feyd (who appears a little effeminiate !).
The Worms are, if anything, better than their counterparts on film but the Guild Navigators less so, alas. The special effects are generally well done (especially the flying sequences above Dune).
The 'Special Features' were a little sparse - just a 'Behind-The-Scenes' feature, Cast and Crew info, some stills and sketches and a 'Cinematic Treatment' (a series of screens of writing by a member of the production crew to help explain the story).
The overall picture quality was reasonable (although the 'Blue within Blue' eyes did not always show up properly ! It seemed to depend on what angle a character was facing the camera ! Also, the 'Cinematic Treatment' was somewhat blurry and was a little difficult to read).

1391383,2,B000053V8F,"Like the previous reviewer, I can't figure how so many people liked this film so much. I confess that I've seen the Lynch movie more times than I've read _Dune_, so while watching it, I could not help but see how in so many ways the Lynch movie far surpasses this near-disaster, particularly in the first half. I will hereby lay out a case for why the Lynch film (hereafter referred to as tLF) blows this thing out of the water.
The extra length in this miniseries version seems to be squandered. The exposition, to a scene almost without exception, is far superior in tLF. Someone should splice the analogous scenes from each version end to end, and it would be so obvious: the Pain Box scene, Paul and Jessica's escape into the desert and realization that Leto is dead, the sandworm riding scene,  and so on. They keep showing Feyd in his little fighting-arena but never get to the part in the book where the slave almost kills him, so it just becomes pointless. Worst of all, I believe Dr. Yueh is shown on screen *once* before he is revealed as a traitor. Once again, contrast that to tLF, where his strong ties with the family are clearly portrayed, making the betrayal actually _mean_ something. Count Fenring appears in this version, but seems to just drawl incomprehensibly while hovering around Princess Irulan. If someone had no familiarity with the book, they would be *way* more lost while watching this than tLF, which as people have pointed out, does a good job with the whole `internal monologue' thing which is so crucial to this story. The makers of this miniseries seem to think the additional length will somehow paper over the need for exposition. It doesn't. The only bright spot is the role of Princess Irulan, who is actually well-used in the plot to full effect here, while she barely appears in tLF.
Many of the casting decisions are simply ludicrous. Stilgar looks like someone's Uncle Vinny; he simply occupies space. Contrast this with Everett McGill in tLF, whose `ironman' portrayal is very appropriate. Ironically, the terminally soporific William Hurt is only too appropriate for this film in his statue-like turn as Duke Leto. Feyd looks like a spoiled college frat kid; hardly feral and deadly. Alec Newman seems to be trying too hard for the gravitas and regality that Kyle Machlachlan brought to the role of Paul Atreides. Jessica is merely adequate here and has nothing of the quiet strength and dignity that the actress in tLF did. Emperor Shaddam IV looks like some Vegas singer whose name escapes me. Worst of all is Gurney Halleck, a distinctly unwarriorlike old man who (besides being a *terrible* actor) is a pathetic contrast to Patrick Stewart's flinty, lionhearted Gurney in tLF, a dead-on portrayal. I will concede, however, that the Chani in this version, while sometimes too emotive, is certainly better than Sean Young (prettier too). Too bad they pronounce her name like ""Janey"", though. Also, Alia in this version is pretty cool; she has a very adult concentration about her, whereas in tLF it was just a little kid in a black robe with a weird voice-over.
Thirdly, this miniseries is visually flawed. The costumes are way over the top, and are just ornamentally distracting. The set designs, while lush, are merely elaborate rather than convincing. One gets no sense of what Caladan was like; in tLF you at least get some externals with crashing waves on the rocks so you can see what a change the Atreides had to deal with in their move to Arrakis. The desert scenes, worst of all, are so obviously backdropped that it's just painful to watch. The caves and rocks of the sietch almost remind one of the old Star Trek episodes with the big polystyrene boulders being thrown around.
That's a lot of negatives, but I give this two stars instead of one because it does get somewhat better and more coherent towards the end. Also, the portrayals of Irulan, Chani, and Alia are quite good. And part of its value is, as I've been at such pains to point out, in highlighting what a good job the Lynch movie did (although adding the non-book Weirding Modules) in portraying a complex story with compelling visuals and effective actors in 150 minutes.",1000080000,5,4195,4.7544581618655695
1391384,4,B000053V8F,"There is really no way to adapt this complex book to the film, unless you do it as a two week long mini-series. I think some cowboy wisdom from Bruce R. McConkie is in order here: ""Don't drink below the horses."" If you want the full effect, just read the primary source, the book.
This is ""Take Two"" on adapting the great sci-fi classic to the screen. The Sci-Fi Channel learned from the ""Alan Smithee"" edit of Dune (1984), and kept this film long.
GOOD: This adaptation corrects the two mistakes that Dune (1984) made: adaptation and editing. It is the more faithful adaptation of the novel, and you get a better feel for the plot of the book, which is what makes a better film. The problem is that Dune is primarily a milieu story, and secondarily an action story. That is the main problem adapters have in transposing the book to the screen.
The second good thing is the editing. A coherent story is told, and you follow the lives of characters across time and against fate, which is precisely why we see films. Compare ""Don Quixote"" the novel to ""The Man of La Macha"" the musical. We remember the musical over the novel precisely because of the editing. Don Quixote is primarily a series of gags ad misadventures, which eventually work their way up to a point in part II. We get the kernal of Quixote in ""The Man of La Mancha,"" without doing violence to Cervates's point.
This version puts more emphasis on the Fremen culture and technology, and we are given an explanation about what a mentat is. They also got the navigator's eyes right: all users of spice should have blue in blue eyes.
I'm not sure if this is a good or bad, but they give Princess Irulan a more prominent role in this adaptation. In the book, she serves as the narrator/chronicler of the life of Muad'Dib.
BAD: The fist thing we notice is the sets, costumes, and lighting which make this film look like an episode of Farscape. Another issue is Casting. Kodetova doesn't look like an elfin Chiani, and she has a lot of personal strength to be imposing. Not like the elfin Sean young from Dune (1984).
This can also be called the ""American"" version of Dune. On July 4, 1776, we lost our sense of royalty and the pageantry and majesty associated with royalty. Lynch captures this feel for royalty, this version doesn't get it. Fro example, Alec Neuman starts out by playing a ""James Dean"" Paul Atreides (notice the feet on the table), though he eventually squares up to being Muad'Dib.

The book spans some three hundred something pages, and to fit the intricacies of a novel of this length and detail into a mini-series is impossible; the comparison between the tv mini-series and the book, even, is a pointless one. With each transfer to a different medium, you lose details and you gain others, since each medium has its unique idiosyncrasies. Therefore, it seems to me a mistake to judge the mini-series or even the movie in comparison to the book, and makes even more sense to judge it independently within the context of each medium. If any comparison can be made is that this mini-series adequately preserves the human element and its metaphoric parallel relevance to our own time of environmental degradation, political intrigue and corruption, lifestyle dependence on finite natural resources, and spirituality as the original book intended. Some might even consider it ""injustice"" to the book, that some details of fremen rituals or political ""feints within feints within feints within feints"" were excluded. I might even suggest that for the medium, and the time allowed, these scenes, although relevant, are not necessarily needed. The directors of the mini-series have done a wonderful job adapting the book to the screen.

I saw the original at the movie theater, when it opened, and I watched the original again a few years ago--but, this New version is Much More Comprehensible (!!!) and flows very well.

This version of Dune will suck you in and keep your attention for hours.  The special effects are fascinating, but not over-done.  It's all-about the Story & you get a lot more of the Story, with this new version of ""Dune.""  This version gives a Deeper look into the life and development of the main character.

This considered, I think that Frank Herbert's Dune is a triumphant success that manages to outdo the David Lynch offering from the early 80s in almost every possible way. It is clear that Lynch tried to fit a vast narrative into a two hour feature, and that the pacing suffered as a direct result of it. Thus the miniseries format (in which this first premiered on Sci-Fi) has a definite edge over its predecessor. The tale is finally given the canvas that it deserves (and the modern technology as well).
Dune is full of intrigues and bitter rivalries, and all of the actors involved in this project are superb. The set designs are amazing and probably set new standards, and the visuals are far preferable to those seen in the 80s version (as can be expected, of course). And yet none of the production values serve to conceal the true star of the picture - the story. And the story is most certainly a winner.
Frank Herbert's Dune is certainly the best made-for-television picture to come forth in quite some time (next to Attila in its quality). As a result, grading on a made-for-television curve, Dune earns its 5 stars, and even were it a theatrical motion picture I would have no reluctance to offer 4...",997920000,,1393,4.598393574297189
1391393,2,B000053V8F,"The new Dune mini-series is a prettier version of Herbert's epic, but is not a patch on Lynch's 1984 version.  It lacks the sheer menace of Lynch's film - it is, after all, the tale of a life and death struggle - and takes distorting liberties with Herbert's text.  Paul, for example, is portrayed as a sulky, rebellious youth rather than as the dutiful,conscientious and loving son of Duke Leto.  The sympathetic relationship between Paul and Irulan is not in the book.  William Hurt is wooden and impassive as Duke Leto, and lacks the charisma necessary to be the potent leader of a great House.  While it is true that Lynch's film is incomprehensible unless the viewer has read Herbert's novel, it is a far more faithful translation of Herbert's story into film than the mini-series.  If you enjoyed Herbert's book - and I think it is one of the great science fiction novels - than you will be annoyed by the mini-series' departures from the text.  The film for all its faults, is still gripping viewing and conveys the classic tension between the forces of good and evil more convincingly than the almost languid mini-series.
To be fair, the mini-series does have some positive features.  However, beautifully designed sets and costumes, and realistic computer generated technology are no substitute for engaging characterisation and enthralling plot.

1391394,3,B000053V8F,"The battle rages... Not the one in the movie, the one over which ""Dune"" is THE version to watch: the David Lynch 1984 version or the 2000 made- for-TV version.
If you are unfamiliar with the story, it's far too detailed to go into here, but I can tell you that it's really less of a science fiction story and more of a political/coming-of- age/love/prophecy/war/action story all rolled into one.  The reason Herbert's novel was (and is) such a hit is that all these elements are present and done well.  It spoke to a lot of people when it came out in the 1960's and still does today.  It's a very powerful story that, let's face it, is almost impossible to successfully put onscreen.  But let's take a look anyway...
The 2000 version has several advantages over the Lynch version:  It is much more comprehensive in scope, there is a much clearer distinction of which planet we're looking at and what is happening there, and the film just plain looks good.  The sets and costumes are first rate, and most of the special effects work convincingly.  Even though the producers went to a lot of trouble to get a wide variety of actors, they really never settle in or have chemistry as an ensemble.  Several people have mentioned William Hurt's ""sleepwalking"" performance.  Actually he's not in much of the film.  Probably the filmmakers needed a successful, proven name to carry the film and bring in an audience beyond those who typically watch the Sci-Fi Channel, where it was first shown.
After all is said and done, the best way to experience Dune is in print.  It is a fascinating book (even if you don't like science fiction) that will pull you into the worlds of Dune and its characters.  Get the book, dive in and enjoy.",997833600,,1723,4.594771241830065
1391395,2,B000053V8F,"Alot of people slammed the original Lynch movie of Dune because it absolutely made no sense and changed or added so much junk (e.g. giving Baron Harkonnen purple zits, making ""Wierding"" really stupid, and so on).  And they were right.
The Dune mini-series doesn't commit such obvious gaffes.  It tells pretty much the whole story and doesn't add or invent insipid gimmicks just to make the movie more ""cool"" (such as heartplugs and the Baron harkonnen eating black slug juice?!).  Did I mention they did alot better job with Baron Harkonnen?  But it still stinks.
1.  The acting ... .  William Hurt was comatose, and Paul Atredies... who was supposed to be a deeply wise prodigy... came off as a ... wanker.  Thufir Hawat, who works for the Atredies and is supposedly one of the deadliest people alive, comes off as a goofy bureaucrat.  The best part of the cast was, in a 180 degree turn around from the Lynch film... Baron Harkonnen, who comes of as smart and devious (which he was) instead of really gross and insane.  Give Lynch credit, though, at least he had Patrick Stewart play Gurney Halleck.
2.  I'm sorry, but in Sci-Fi you have to bring SOME special effects to the table.  This mini-series had pathetic special effects.  We aren't talking about not living up to ""The Matrix"" here, we're talking about not living up to ""Ghostbusters"" or one of the more recent Star Trek TV episodes.  To be fair, it WAS better than the Ghostbusters CARTOONS...
3.  The one place where the Lynch film got it right was in feel; it really gave you the sense of being in a wierd, advanced-and-primitive-at-once far future.  The miniseries had headache-inducing color schemes but that's it.  Maybe if they scrimped on the miles of sumptuous fabric and paid for some decent CG effects or, God forbid, actually FILMED DESERT SCENES IN A DESERT instead of on a soundstage not fit for a ""Win Ben Stein's Money"" episode.  And lest you think this unfair, at least Ben Stein filmed his beach-themed shows ON A BEACH.  So it can be done.
I really wanted to like this miniseries but wasn't all that impressed.  I don't know how they goofed up with such good source material, but there ya go.  To be fair, though, probably the only way to really do the book justice would be to make it into 3 feature-length movies with a humungous budget and top actors.  And Patrick Stewart.

The SciFi Channel's version is based on the 25th Anniversary rewrite of Dune.  Does William Hurt seem to sleep-walk through the first part?  I couldn't think of a less exciting portrayal of Duke Leto.  And he is given top billing?  Like the 25th anniversary book, this film version lacks the character development and intensity of the original.  There is, in my opinion, over-emphasis on the Fremen adoration of Paul, and little time to character development; the characters of Thufir, Gurney, Duncan, Pieter hardly seem to exist.",996969600,2,680,5.127272727272727
1391399,1,B000053V8F,"This ""praised"" new version of Frank Herbert's masterpiece does not even begin to capture the essence of the original work.  Some say that creative liberties were taken with David Lynch's version, but this version is an entire metamorphoses of the novel.  No respect was paid for critical events such as the true importance of Yueh and his role in the downfall of House Atreides, the Harkonnen bloodlust seems completely absent, and Paul is a whiny disciple of Luke Skywalker.  I remember hearing that this version was better because it brought in many important events left absent in the original version, but this is also untrue.  Whatever elements this film adds, it disgracefully skews in a hopeless attempt to make it more digestible to an illiterate, TV watching populous.
Key details such as the Bene Gesserit and their breeding program, the strength of the Spacing Guild, and the extent of the Emperor's involvement in the downfall of the Atreides are either completely ignored or distorted beyond all comprehension.  Princess Irulan, intended only to play a small part in the original story as Paul's key to the throne, but more importantly, as a pawn in the Bene Gesserit schemes, attempts to take the story over, obliging herself with a role she was never intended to have.
But I think it was the little details that bothered me the most.  For example, no one paid any heed to water customs (why in God's name are any Fremen running around without Stiltsuits?).  And it seemed the director was more concerned with casting every other actor with some ridiculous accent then attempting to suit them to the role (Duncan is an outright disgrace).
I am aware that I'm among the minority that enjoyed the original version, not just because it's light-years better than this current version, but the integrity of the book was preserved, regardless of the obvious fact that it was dreadfully condensed.  For anyone who truly appreciated the book, respect must be paid to the 1984 film which extrapolated some brilliant representations of the characters that Frank Herbert himself said, in some ways, contained better characterizations than his own book.  Supposedly, Harrison was very familiar with Herbert's masterpiece, but his knowledge of the book certainly doesn't reveal itself in his film version.  He went beyond the scope of creative liberties and constructed an appalling heresy of one of the greatest science fiction novels of all time.

1391401,5,B000053V8F,"I've read the book, and seen both David Lynch's version and this version many times. Although the book is obviously the best of the three venues one can experience Dune, this is by far better than David Lynch's version.
The book tells a story of political intrigue, violence, ancient prophesies, rebellion, and various religious cults fighting for control of a tiny desert planet of Arrakis, or Dune, which holds the Spice that controls the entire universe. ""He who controls the spice controls the universe."" The world created by Frank Herbert ranks among my favorite sci-fi/fantasy universes created in a novel, along with Tolkien's Middle Earth. Herbert created two distant religions, that of the Fremen and the Bene Gesserit, and a believable feudal system of government of the known Universe.
Now let's get to the two movie versions of this great epic. The beginning of the David Lynch version is good, introducing you to the Atreides, Harkonnen, the Emperor, and the Bene Gesserit, but they take a long time to do it. I consider that segment equal to the corresponding segment of this new movie version, but there is a problem with the Lynch version. After you get to the fall of House Atreides, you only have 45 min. to tell the rest of the story, while in this new version there's another three hours to tell it all! In Lynch's version you don't get to know anything about the Fremen whatsoever, just that they are some native desert people that Paul ""Muad'dib"" uses in his quest to take back Arrakis. In Lynch's version all you get of the Paul/Chani love story is a 15 second snippet with some narration ""Paul and Chani's love grew"" where as in this version you get to see the complex relationship that they have, their love for each other, but Chani's fear of Paul for the power he holds. In this movie you get to see a lot of Fremen culture, which is really the heart of the novel. In short, this new version gives you so much more of the STORY and CHARACTERS of Dune.
Now let's talk special effects. It is true that Lynch had some better effects in his film, even though it was 15 years older than this new version, but special effects are secondary to a story as rich as this. Besides, I didn't think they were that bad for this new miniseries. After all, Harrison is working on a TV budget and is trying to make a 4 1/2 hour movie. But the space special effects I thought were very good, and even some minor effects like the shields, and when Jessica takes the Water of Life, much richer than in the Lynch version. And the sand worms, they were just spectacular, almost horrifying, although they obviously copy off of Lynch's design. Yes, the little jumping rat was such a shame, and many of the scenes in the end looked like they came from computer games, but that doesn't detract from this film, since the story carries the movie in a way the Lynch movie didn't.
In Lynch's movie you get such a long set up, and then some fighting, and the knife battle at the end, and it ends. You're like ""man, what happened?"" Even for someone who hasn't read Dune, there are obviously unanswered questions and plot lines not followed up on after that elaborate of a set up. And, the last 45 min. of Lynch's Dune was so confusing that if you hadn't read the book you couldn't understand it! Now, I grant that some of the stuff dealing with the sand worm's relationship to the Water of Life would be confusing in this movie if you haven't read the book, but it's just so much better.
I'll end on this note: Read the book, it's great. Buy this movie and watch it over and over again. Rent Lynch's version and just watch it once to compare the two, and you'll see why this movie",995760000,3,3675,4.494768310911809

My lord the characters were so horribly portrayed in this version that it ruined anything that could have been redeemable from it.  What is most contradictory is that in the director/producers own words he claims that his first instinct to tackle a film of this magnitude was to go with great actors.  Well he failed miserable and aside from some random quality performances (Irulan is decent, Gurney is quality, Kynes is done well on occaision) you will be left bored and unconvinced that this series was taken seriously.  There is talk now that they will be combining Dune Messiah and Children of DUne to create the next miniseries.  One can only hope he goes with a whole new cast.

1391407,3,B000053V8F,"Visually, this is very stunning, and overall and I am quite impressed with the caliber of this treatment of the colossal and important book Dune.  The story really is one that needed this longer treatment, though I would say it really needed at least one more hour, since even as full as this movie is, it still leaves out some cool stuff.  But unlike the first Dune movie, this one doesn't need you to have read the book to understand what is happening (though to understand the political, ecological, and religious message that Frank Herbert was giving us, you really must read the book).
I think the sets are really quite cool, and there is wonderful stylistic differences between the Harkonnens (angular, sharp, lots of reds, lots of open flat spaces and surfaces), Dune, the Emperor (authoritative blues, hints of classical governmental architecture), the Spacing Guild (mysterious architecture and clothing), etc.  The characterizations are well done, the filming is quite good.  I mean, apart from a few moments, the film does not exude that ""made for TV quality"" that made for TV movies normally have.  This was seriously done, and done well.
The writing really took the story of Dune and was very honest and true to it.  I haven't noticed anything yet this is blatantly against the book, except that I don't think Baron Harkonnen is fat enough, and the Reverend Mother comes off as a bit of a high-pitched shrieking shrew and not the imposing and fear-causing authority figure that she should be.  This is where the David Lynch film excelled - the Reverend Mother and the Lady Jessica were acted like serious, intense powerful beings, with their own secretive religious and political agenda.
The only detriment to the movie is the consistently poor quality of the acting, on the part of all the actors (except Baron Harkonnen and Princess Irulan, who, IMO, are very good actors).  Paul Atreides has moments of wonderful acting, and then moments of stiff, poor acting.
The special effects are great, Arrakis really looks like Arrakis.  The sandworms are really cool. The sietches look like natural rock.  The Spacing Guild navigator looks like he is described in the book.  The stillsuits look like what stillsuits should look like.  Very, very good production, especially considering it was made for TV.
For the Dune fans - you really are safe watching this movie.  For people who have not read Dune yet - I suggest you watch this movie and get a feel for one of the most epic writings and stories ever put on paper, and then go read the book, and be transported into a literary artistic world that will leave you changed, and forever wondering and thinking about how politics, ecology, and religion are interrelated in our own world, and will make you wonder about the wheels within wheels within wheels of our country's political schemings, and the schemings within the Church. It's a story about the process of gaining power, and holding on to power, using power, and losing power. But of course, it's also about much, much more than that.",994032000,11,3051,4.855491329479769
1391408,4,B000053V8F,"It had been years since I last read the excellent first book of the Dune Chronicles, so I was a little rusty when I watched the new 4-hour mini-series.  All my memories of Dune had been colored by David Lynch's excellent 1984 movie version.  Sadly, that may have been why I enjoyed Frank Herbert's Dune much less than I should have.
David Lynch injected so many visions of grandeur and mysticism in his 1984 movie that this new version seemed lacking in comparison.  For example, the Bene Gesserit ""voice"" was done to much better effect in the 1984 version - here, it lacked convincing power.  The scene of a Guild Navigator ""folding space"" was also much more mystical and awe-inspiring in the 1984 version.  The computer generated effects such as those of space-ships and ornithopters looked, well, too much like scenes from a computer game.  It's sad when the special effects of a 2000 production cannot hold up to one made in 1984.  However, I'll admit that the sandworms looked as awe-inspiring as ever.
Kyle MacLachlan portrayed a wonderful Paul Atreides in 1984 - young and inexperienced, but calm and in control of his own destiny - but Alec Newman's Paul Atreides came across almost as whiny as Luke Skywalker was in Star Wars: A New Hope, in some of the earlier scenes.  The Baron looked and acted much less menacing and degenerate than he did in the 1984 version, though Feyd did have a bigger role here than Sting's ""stand around looking pretty and menacing"" role in 1984.
All the above does not mean that I did not enjoy ""Frank Herbert's Dune"".  I did, and I also liked the fact that it followed the novel much more closely than David Lynch's version.  The sets and costumes (especially Princess Irulan's gowns) were wonderful.  However, its weaknesses precluded a five-star rating from me.

But you are still left with an epic movie, deep, indeed complex, thrilling, and enjoyable. I watched the whole thing from beginning to end in one sitting, and I thoroughly enjoyed every moment.
Based on the reputation of the book as a very complex tale of intrigue and struggle, I knew a four-hour movie just wasn't going to do the book justice. But the trade off is that most of the scenes are rich with story info just asking for analysis and synthesis. They left stuff out because if they packed any more in, the audience might get lost. Maybe. But there are many details and studying them is interesting, it's just not as deep as the book. Well, if you want to read the book, you shouldn't be buying the movie, right? I know, I know.. Actually it sounds like the book and the movie conflict, so if you read the book you won't like the movie.
As would be expected of a pan-galactic human civilization, there is an abundance of cultures. The nuances that you encounter in the movie fit in perfectly. Many of the characters and personalities have strange accents and place emphasis on odd syllables. Not only do they do this well and believably, but it adds a lot of realism to the whole production. I really enjoyed the facet that toyed with speech.
All in all, Dune is visually spellbinding. But, sometimes you can see that they are filming on a cheesy pile of sand set with a backdrop. What can you expect from a four hour movie that is supposed to look like it was all shot in a desert? But for the scenes that count, the special effects are breathtaking.
Towards the end of the series the story kind of breaks down. Too much is going on, and much of it is mystical, having to do with the effects of ""the Spice"" on a few of the main characters.

Now in my thirties, I see the whole Dune series so differently, all thanks to the TV series. In fact, after watching the TV series, I scoured book stores to buy another copy of DUNE (which I threw away after reading it in my teens!)! I gave up my search and finally ordered them from Amazon!
In a weird and inexplicable way, I could never forget, till today the strange icons of DUNE: the god-like Navigators and their mysterious spacing-guild agents (one wonders why the Navigators, who can traverse the universe  without moving, need to be 'chaperoned' around by humanoid guild agents!?), the mystical Bene Gessirit witchdom and its antithetical Mentat counterparts (who worships ""...Logic & Statistics.""), the CHOAGM commerce system not unlike our terra equivalent WTO, the WORMS, the SPICE MELANGE (so rich in imagination and detailed description by Herbert that you could almost be deceived into thinking that it actually exists in the universe!) the systematic breeding program to cultivate a KWISATZ HADERACH - a messiah figure...the central theme running through all the DUNE books. (sorry folks, DUNE is about messiah-figures, NOT about SPICE or Space-travel.)
Herbert was a genius in creating all these idioms of a highly provocative and complex yet so intriguingly and enticingly real world (and thereby human). Yet, when he created the world-view in DUNE, he had intended it to be a series of studies on messiah-figures. In other words, he attempted to humanise something which is divine and immortal. He played God and tried to think like God when constructing the Mahdi/KWISATZ HADERACH/messiah Paul Muab'dib Atreides. Personally, the whole DUNE series of books is Herbert's personal search for God, whether futile or otherwise, nobody knows. But thanks to him, I get to write this review and enjoy his story!
On the above basis, I think the DUNE TV series outperforms the Lynch adaptation. The messiah psyche was explored in much greater depth and with greater sensitivity as well, pay close attention to the private conservations between Jessica and Paul...when Jessica had intrigued, whether she believed or not, to perpetuate the godliness of her son amongst the Fremen just to preserve their lives. It makes you wonder whether gods are incidental, self-made or truly divine. See also how frustrated Paul was when he couldn't see the future and was driven to risk his life by taking the poisonous Water of Life. Is this how a messiah becomes created? Read the next book DUNE:MESSIAH to see how Paul's life ended...
Other nuggets in the TV series provide compelling comparison with the movie version, e.g. a blue-eyed (caused by consuming spice) Navigator who looks more humanoid than the orange (spice color) gas spewing bug-like Lynch version. MUCH, MUCH better WORMS in the TV series, and a better depiction, i.e. explanation of the Water of Life from Shai-hulud. With the exception of Paul & Chani, everyone on the TV series looked better. Special mention must go to Emperor Shaddam IV, the Italian actor who also acted in Hannibal and Jessica, Saskia Reeves, who added that all important touch of human vulnerability into her character. I give 5 stars to the TV series because despite all its short-comings (e.g. too short, awful costumes, sets that were less opulent and grand than the Lynch sets), it fleshed out the critical details of a great story and more importantly, it was just long enough to provide a more satisfying characterisation of the protagonists, thereby adding depth to the story where the Lynch version failed.
In summary, get the TV series if you are NEW to DUNE and can't be bothered to read the book...and chances are that after watching the TV series, you will still find too many questions unanswered and end up buying the books! The curiosity will drive you to buy the books, IF you like sci-fi and opulent epics.",993081600,4,4078,4.979472140762463
1391413,2,B000053V8F,"I read all the Dune books well before the first movie came out. They were awesome! When David Lynch made his version, I was pleased by his visual interpretations. I understood too, that it is nearly impossible to recreate the book on screen.
Well, Obviously I should have waited for more reviews to come in before I bought this wasted attempt of a Dune remaking. I certainly agree with most of the negative comments in the reviews herein.
First off, as a general goal, a second try at a Dune production should at least be a little better than the first. This one wasn't! I was especially surprised at William Hurts terribly weak portrayal of Duke Leto. My jaw dropped every time he mumbled his lines on screen. My gosh, is this guy really playing a leader? terrible! and the other actors? terrible too!
It looked like half of it was filmed on a simple stage with plastic rock outcroppings. what a famine for the eyes! and the clothing and props? heck, I could make better ones out of paper mache'!

1391414,3,B000053V8F,"This is supposedly the second crack at filming the first novel of Frank Herbert's Dune series.  Set in a far-off future where drugs are used to expand human consciousness, and living computers replaced the thinking machines that had previously enslaved the human race, Dune tells the story of Paul Atreides, heir to the Dukedom of the Atreides family.  Sent to rule the key world of Arrakis (AKA Dune), the Atreides family is nearly wiped out by its blood-lusting adversaries of the Harkonnen.  Dune's importance stems from the fact that it is the sole source of Melange, a hallucinogenic spice that is relied on for much of the era's prosperity.  In small quantities, it extends life and even youth.  In greater quantities, it expands consciousness, turning its users into living computers called Mentats, or telepaths like the ceaselessly plotting Sisters of the Bene Gesserit.  In its greatest quantities, spice turns men into ""navigators"", advanced life-forms who use thought control to guide spaceships through space-warps.  Between the Emperor - the Universe's nominal ruler - together with the Bene Gesserit, the Navigators and the nobles who comprise the Landsraad, power is divided and nobody rules concretely.  As a result, all are subject to a state of perpetual plotting and live a life forever on guard.  The Harkonnen- Atreides war is only one of the more noteable Machiavellian plots.
Thought dead by the Harkonnen, Paul and his mother Jessica, a secret sister of the Bene Gesserit, escape into the harsh desert of Dune, only to meet the Fremen, the poor but faithful and strong indigenous people of Dune.  Between the melange, the harsh ways of the Fremen and his mother's Bene Gesserit training, Paul finds his mental capabilities changing but in ways never previously seen.  To the remnants of the Atreides, Paul becomes a hoped for omen of revenge against the Harkonnen.  To the Fremen, he becomes a leader, the promised saviour who will lead the fremen in a holy war against the empire that has used Dune as its reservoir of spice.  To Jessica, Paul shows signs of becoming the mysterious Kwisatz Haderach, a genetically engineered super-being whose power will exceed even that of the dreaded navigators.  Paul ofcourse has the least idea of what is happening to him, knowing only that it will lead him head-on with the forces that have embittered his life and those of the Fremen.
Dune is a classic mostly because it resists attempts to re-interpret it as you'd get in movie or TV versions (or in ""prequels"" too).  Though the first shot at  a Dune movie (Dir. David Lynch, 1984) was a monster flop, this new version doesn't really surpass it, and only made me appreciate the earlier attempt.  Freed from having to fit the epic story into something less than 3 hours long, this newer version goes a bit too long, unstructured and mis-timed.  Some of the story actually takes its cue from the Lynch movie and not the novel it's supposed to be loyal too (here, as in the film, Baron Harkonnen rejoices at the death of his rival, Duke Atreides, though the book's devotees remember the moment as an embarassing moment for the Baron).  The special effects are mostly CGI (though better CGI than on LEXX) and less exciting in most spots than the admittedly crude models of the '84 film.  The neatness of CGI also robs the story of its oppressive paranoia (the main characters are supposed to see themselves as the sleep-in-the-upright-position type), while the sets look as real as something from a latter Dr. Who episode, and the characters lack the subtle sociopathologies that made them so much fun (the Baron's misogynistic side remains untouched).

I found this disappointing when compared to the Lynch version on many points.  First, the acting; it is blatent that the quality of the cast of the mini-series serious lags behind the Lynch version at nearly every major character. I found myself missing Kyle Maclaughlin, Sting and even Patrick Stewart.  Even William Hurt seems to be phoning this one in.  Second, the effects and sets look seriously cheap.  The desert scenes are performed in front of what looks like painted backdrops for a really elaborate high school production of Paint Your Wagon.  Costumes seemed to be borrowed from the set of a special 2 hour Xena.
I do like the choices the  director of the mini=series made as far as cutting a few of the scenes to explain epic.  Making this a jazzed up Cliff Note version of the Dune saga.

1391418,4,B000053V8F,"It is a TV film in three parts. It only concerns the first volume of the Dune series by Frank Herbert. It is both better and less good than the cinema film. It is better because it gives a lot more details and it takes time to analyze the various dimensions of the book, and particularly because it gives the full and final negociation between Leto II and the other proponents (the Emperor, the navigators of the Guild, the Bene Gesserit).So we are more satisfied after this series because we do follow the plot and the discussions of the book. But it is less good than the cinema film because it has a typical television rhythm, slower and cut up in sections to enable advertising to slip in. This cut up progression emphasizes the naturally slower rhythm. Of course, too, special effects are a lot less rich and brilliant, and anything that is slightly warped in the book is cleaned up in this TV series. So, it becomes more difficult to follow the extreme provocative value of the book in this adaptation, though we had that, even if too fast and too skimpy, in the cinema film.

I wanted to see such an awesome book put into picture, even though i knew it really couldn't compare to the book. But this movie/miniseries was just horrible. The sets were bad, the backdrops didn't blend at all with the real set. The only set i really liked was the interior of the palace. The costumes were ridiculus to the point of laughable. Like Thufir wearing a purple chinese take-out box on his head! And the casting was poorly done too. Paul was stupid, his mother was too wooden, and many of Pauls mentors and such were too old and clumsy. Take for example the training fight between gurney and paul..it looked as though gurney was drunk and uncoordinated. The only people i thought played their parts relatively well were Dr. Kynes, and Duke Leto. The others were just too obviously SF channel cheesy.  The ornithopters looked stupid, nothing else to them, just stupid. And did anyone else notice the computer screen in the Duke's thopther? It looked like my ancient Tandy 1000!  One thing i did like was the sandworm..the first time i saw the worm rear up out of the sand to devour the harvester i was just like, wow.  Another thing that sorta left you in the dust was the whole thing of Paul being the Kwisatz Haderach(or however u spell it).. they never even mentioned that, they just showed fremen staring at him in the street saying Muad'Dib.  Pauls whole mystique as a god or what not was completely lost in this movie.  For example, they showed him dreaming and then he wakes up and he's like, mom you made me a freak.  Well, where did that come from? I mean, everybody dreams weird stuff.

1391424,4,B000053V8F,"Having read the entire series of Herbert's ""Dune"" novels, and having seen both film adaptations, here are a few thoughtful comments. Inasmuch as both films are based on a pre-existant literary work, common sense dictates that any evaluation of an adapation must procede from an understanding of the source material. Many of the reviews I've read here strike me as utterly arrogant and illiterate for their casual dismissal of any involvement with the source material. Other people are more concerned with packaging and ""chatchkes"" than with substance. So it goes, I guess. Real criticism must spring from other roots.
Herbert's novels are complex literary vehicles. It is probably not possible to take any work of literature and transpose it to another medium without losing much in the translation. Such a transposition must, therefore, find ways of portraying its sources without doing violence to them. Both of the Dune movies demonstrate this problem quite clearly, but each has its own character and succeeds in its own terms.
Whatever went on behind the scenes with David Lynch's film, the end result was a highly stylized condensation of the novel. ""Condensation"" is the key word - for Lynch evidently tried to give the broad outline of the narrative - rather than the details. What his production might miss in terms of technological sophistication is made up with its solid core group of actors. Many object to the Baron Harkonnen characterization in Lynch's film. But, go back and read the book. VB (Vladimir Harkonnen, not the computer language, or myabe both!) is a rather a disgusting fellow. Take the film for what it is - and don't criticize it for what it isn't.
Now comes the mini-series - and we have a curious reversal. With one's own inner intuition about the visual/dramatic content from a)the book, and b) the first movie, the second movie strikes one as much more complete - at least insofar as representing the events and structure of Herbert's narrative. Visually much more stunning than the earlier film, and much more complete in its exposition of the situations, it is also more than twice as long. Those who can not think in long stretches complain that the action moves too slowly. Sorry, friends, complex situations can not be rammed down your brain to a hip-hop back beat. If anything, this film was too short for me. So many scenes invite comparison - but, remember the source that material came first. Curiously, the acting overall struck me as serviceable, but rather leaden - one almost has the impression of ensemble performance without direction. It's hard to be completely objective about this given the ""other"" film and one's own personal preferances. So it goes.
The musical scores for both films were atrocious and, professionally speaking, were serious handicaps to both films. Can you imagine what Bernard Herrmann or Alex North would have done with such films?
So, in the end we have a draw. Each film, without question, has things to recommend it. Neither is entirely satisfactory. For the rest: read the novel(s). Enjoy Lynch's rather gothic treatment-as-summary, but also enjoy the mini-series for its greater depth and detail. Ultimately, the best version will be seen in the theater of your mind.

1391425,2,B000053V8F,"Really very weak.  Nearly all of the acting is really bad - the quality one expects in a soap opera.  The only performance that stands out is Ian McNeice as the Baron.  Many of the actors have thick accents that make the dialogue difficult to follow. Many of them mumble their lines, in a misguided and failed attempt to make what they're saying seem portentous.  With the exception of McNeice, most of the actors seem to have badly missed the proper interpretation of their character - I suppose that is the fault of the Director.  Nobody appears to have read the book.  The fighting sequences (with the exception of the final knife fight between Muad'Dib and Feyd) are poorly done.  Fremen society is portrayed in a way that makes them seem like a bunch of salad-eating new-agers, rather than the proud, fierce warrior culture of the book.  The costume design is odd, and appears to have been heavily influenced by the Italian renaissance.  The stillsuits don't look like they'd do what they're supposed to do.
On the positive side, the set design is really outstanding.  Some of the long shots are very obviously backdrops, such as the city of Arrakeen, but for the most part the sets are very impressive.  The worms are pretty good.  There are a few interesting special effects.

But, I just kept wanting more, wanting to soak in the detail and the depth of the production. Yeah, there's lots of niggling about what COULD have been better. Everybody knows ""good art"" when they see it, and can be a critic, right? My observations are based on having read and reread the book countless times, having dreamed of what the movie would be like since I was a teen, having seen the ""Sting"" version of the film (""abridged"" is the most polite term I can use for that, as it dashed my childhood hopes), and having read every other Dune book in the series excepting the new Dune 'House' prequels.
This movie is faithful to the script and even the irritating things about the characters are pretty true to interpretation about them derived from the book. Paul is a talented, well-trained, inexperienced boy at the beginning and comes across that way. By the end of the book he's become a god - not an easy transition to make for an actor in a 3.5 hr movie! But it comes across well. The sets and effects are splendid. The sandworms are SOOOOOO much more like what I expected after reading the books. Beast Rabban is exactly as you'd expect; Feyd is pretty close to right on target; the Guild and their navigators are pretty good...I could go on.

I was enraptured when I heard of a new mini-series dedicated to the timeless tale of spice and sand.  Yet, when I finished this little tidbit, I was left wanting...wanting more, wanting people to stop trying.
First, lets say that the cast was acceptable.  I mean, I could buy William Hurst as Duke Leto, yet, there was something missing...I mean, I just couldn't feel his performance.  But no matter, a weak performance here and there isn't going to seriously cripple a movie.  Alec Newman is simply Ok was Paul...I expected them to use two actors as Paul, as he does get much older through the course of the story...but, Ok, I'll let it slide.  We got one Paul that could hold the role, much better than we got in Lynch's version.
What I can't take is the inclusion of practically non-exsistant characters.
Now, I may be tooting the same old horn as many other reviewers, but here is goes:  Princess Irulan did not play an intregal part in the book.  She was barely there at the end, merely a toy for Muad'Dib to marry so he could secure the throne.  She did not flirt, talk, or even see him presumably before that point.  This does not jive well with me, o my fellow movie watchers...
The whole package left me a bit short, I'm afraid.  I mean, I wanted to like it...and I did like it better than Lynch's version.  There were just too many little inconsistancies and problems for me to truly like it.  I can't buy the open sietch idea, and the wandering around without the stillsuits.
On the other hand, though, the graphics were superb.  They were done well, and I loved the look of the Guild Navigator...kudos to the graphics team...
...but the money should have been spent on screenplay production.  I've seen it tried twice, and I want it to stop.

Unfortunately, all of the lead actors were wooden and unconvincing, especially in the first two hours.

The story itself is really okay. Although it supposed to take place some thousands years ahead but the storyline is close to reality these days. Dune is about politics, survival, war, love, conspiracy, superstitious, competitive advantage of the spice (okay let's say monopoly), etc etc. It's all there and the storyline flows perfectly, although I got little bored in the last 90 minutes (episode III). Perhaps that's what happened when you tried to watched the whole 4.5 hours in one evening.
The actors and actresses are okay, although only William Hurt is the only well known actor. The others played their part well. I'm not very comfortable with Paul's wife (who's her name?). At first she's a strong character. I was hoping she could be Paul's righthand, but in the end I have to realize she has responsibility to her family/ child. Another character who I hoped could be important was Idaho, The Duke's righthand and Paul's best friend. He only appeared thrice before he got killed during the ambush.
Another character I liked is the Princess. She's beautiful, smart, ambigious, etc. I thought she could be on par with Paul, on the empire side of course. But after I watched the interview with the Director and everybody, I just knew that this character didn't take part on the book. So the expanding character is definitely only in the movie. What a good job. I also love Julie Cox, the princess. I was surprised when I read her biography saying that she once stayed and learned acting in my hometown, Jakarta Indonesia.
Paul's mother could be exploited more. Especially with the relationship with the Empire's Reverend Mother. They are not just like a mother with her daughter. It's more than that. When Paul's mother escaped with Paul and joined the desert people, I thought the emotional bond between her and Reverend Mother could be exploited. Something like Ben Kenobi and Luke Skywalker in Star Wars.
The interior designs of the emperor's castle, the duke's castle, the designs of the ships, the design of the costumes are outstanding! Especially the desert airplane that looked like a fly. Very innovative.
Overall I love this mini series. I promise myself to buy this DVD in the future.",990316800,3,2370,4.854320987654321

I can not say it surpasses the original movie only that it provides a better depth for the story that the original lack due to time constrants. Making it into a mini series was about the best way such a story could be presented for comfortable viewing and I would recomend it to anybody looking for a good story, if they don't mind watching it over a couple of days.",990144000,,515,4.16
1391436,2,B000053V8F,"BEAT THE COSTUME DESIGNER!
He is a bad, bad man for bringing back eighties costume style into the new millennium. Most of the costumes were excusable...this being a small cable station's first major presentation and all...throughout most of the movie. Then, the headband Paul wears at the end of the movie was just too much. Another inexcusable costume no-no was Feyd's triangle...what was that all about?! So, the costume designer needs some sense beat into him.
Story wise, it had it's flaws and strengths. I did like how the princess had a bigger role, since the first few books were her chronicles of the Muad'Dib dynasty. However, in the beginning it skipped a lot of the set up Lynch's original version included. This helped build character recognition for more impact during the later events. If it wasn't for the costumes, I probably would have rated this five stars.
Did I mention I hated the costumes?
The DVD is a worthy buy though. The extra's are very informative...except for everything relating to the costume designs...I thought any mention was crap. The widescreen format is a good touch too. I recommend buying it and pretending it was made in the eighties, much easier to deal with the costumes.",990144000,,1214,4.898058252427185

I hadn't read the book when I first saw this, and although it differs greatly from the book, and it convinced me to do so,and I agree that the book was an improvement. But we have to remember that books and films are completely different media, and it is impossible to tranform a book into a movie exactly as it was written. But they did an excellent job on creating a captivating and beautiful film, though it pales in comparison to the book, they did a wonderful job, and the book and this film remained as they should be, two very different things. The acting was very well done, and though the characters weren't exact to those in the book, they managed to make them seem very real. The best thing about this movie was the setting, the landscapes they created were phenomenal, and held up to those in the book, and the costumes worked well. Over all, I would say this was one of my favorite movies yet, and it was a supreme effort for turning a book into a movie.",990057600,,987,4.311827956989247
1391438,3,B000053V8F,"Setting aside all of the debate about which was better (Book! 1984 movie! 2000 miniseries!), I'd like to review the DVD from the point of view of someone who actually bought it and would like to share that experience with others.
Personally, I'd pass on this one if I had the chance to do it over. I'm a Dune fan so I might have bought it anyway eventually, but if I had rented it first I definitely would have thought twice about picking it up the day it came out.
I don't own the original on DVD yet, because after renting the version that's available, I'm waiting for it to get a proper treatment--all the cut footage available, full 5.1 sound, cleanup of some of the matte lines, and all the goodies one could ask for. You know, the 'Criterion' Dune.
So it is with this DVD. It hasn't really been given the proper treatment either. It's on 2 discs (hard to believe that was strictly necessary, considering what they didn't provide), and of course the print is fine visually, a reduced widescreen that looks better than it did when it was broadcast.
The sound, however, blows. It's Dolby 2.0. Although it sounds OK for being 2.0, I felt fairly cheated that I wasn't getting 5.1 on this disc. When that sandworm comes out of the ground I want to FEEL it! And I want my entire apartment building to feel it too!
The extras on the disc are similarly weak. There's a self-serving featurette on the disc, and a montage of words by the cinematographer, all of which kind of add up to you wondering how such talented people managed to produce something that was less than amazing. There's not much that's really insightful or illuminative about the extras; they're puff pieces. I would guess that they want you to buy that 'Making Of' book, instead.
In conclusion, this DVD is probably better as a rental than as an owning. Word is that the SciFi channel has greenlit 'Dune Messiah' and 'Children of Dune' for production, so it's not beyond possibility that those might cause a rerelease of this feature as it should be--with proper sound, et cetera. In the meantime, I'd satisfy my curiosity with a rental before taking the plunge to buy this one.",990057600,27,2144,4.542635658914729

The costumes and scenery were spectacular, and it was great to see that so much of the book had been filmed.  As you would expect, there were scenes cut out from the novel, which is a shame.
There is only one true way to do the longer novles. Mini Series.
As for the actors, they were passable. I didn't have any problems with Paul or Jessica, although I'd have to say the best actor out of the whole group (not including Hurt), had to be gentleman who played Baron Harkonan (I disremember his name).

The casting of William Hurt (Duke Leto Atreides) and Alec Newman (Paul) was an abomination from the start.  The dark aquiline features of the Atreides line are lost herein.  But that could have been over come with any attempt at ACTING.  Hurt, who is capable of great intensity, simmers at the edge of a yawn thruout his participation.  Perhaps he's trying to pass for stoic.  Newman makes a more valiant try but falls short....in truth, it's hard being a Messiah.  That being said, the most recent adaption of Dune is worth owning for the cinematography, design, and supporting players (Fremen are well cast, as is the Emporer).

1391441,1,B000053V8F,"Strange how I'm writing a review on something that I couldn't even finish watching, but alas, the mini-series was a typical british production.  Very stilted dialogue with some of the most horrendous acting I've ever seen coupled with some of the worst editing decisions I've ever seen.
Perhaps a bit more faithful to the plot of the books (which I have read) but thats irrelevant considering that this is a visual medium and should not mirror the book exactly since as differing mediums they need to treat the subject within their own constraints.
I felt within the first two hours of this horrendous waste of time, that the budget spent entirely too much time creating the ""gorgeous"" backdrops that did not fit in with the mental picture I had of the story.  Their desire to create ostentatious costumes seemed more an exercise in gaudiness than an actual attempt to create, or more accurately, recreate a certain medieval attitude in a futuristic society that was a fragile dichotomy of the ancient and the unknown.  It seemed every new scene required some new crazy runway show of clothing with absolute disregard as to what the story and ultimately the characters required for the scene.
If you can get past the productions obsession with costumes and sets as well as the most horrendous voice acting (everything is so damn melodramatic.  It is as if the actors were back in their high school plays), then this movie might be for you.  I tried, I really really tried to watch this as I am a devoted fan of Herbert, but after two hours of this drivel I was sad to find that this a blasphemous attempt to cash in on Herbert's brilliance.",989625600,5,1640,4.700348432055749

1391444,4,B000053V8F,"This movie just became available on video after a successful run on the Sci-fi network. It was a 3 evening mini-series totaling about 4 1/2 hours of movie time. Fans have been crying out for a real version after the 1984 movie version of Dune by David Lynch that simply flopped. It is pretty much impossible to condense a book as complex as ""Dune"" into a two hour movie and do a good job.
The only easily recognizable member of the cast of this new version is William Hurt who plays Duke Leto Atreides. He does an excellent job actually, one of the few who was easily a better casting than in the first movie. The remainder of the cast is European, lots of British, Scottish and Irish actors that I've never heard of before.
This is the gist of Frank Herbert's ""Dune"": In the far future, a talented and well liked Duke (William Hurt's character) and his family are sent to govern the planet Arrakis, which for generations has been under the control of an evil family called the Harkonnens. Arrakis, or Dune as it is also know is a blasted wasteland of sand that no one would even consider habitable if it weren't for the production of spice. Spice is a special ""drug"" that is used by various groups to do many strange wonderful things including space travel (they bend space). Without giving away too much, the Emperor, who arranged the Atreides move to Dune is actually plotting with the Harkonnens to destroy the Atreides family.
The production value on the movie is so-so. You can tell that the budget is limited, but they do an admirable job anyway. CG and green screen technology has come a long way and this wouldn't have been possible 10 years ago. There are a few places where you can tell that the backdrop is fake, but it was a made for TV movie so I can forgive them. I generally liked the cast and the acting. The story line is a classic in the genre, an amazing feat of originality and creativity. Dune is unlike any sci-fi story before or since. Still, the story is complicated, there are layers and layers of in-fighting, politics, back stabbing, religion and economics that can not be covered even in 4 1/2 hours. In the end, you almost have to have read the book to understand what's going on some times.
Having said that, this is a far better effort than the 1984 version. There's just more room to breath and many more of the important scenes are presented. The essence of the book came through much better this time around.
I am a huge fan of the original book and I applaud the effort of the filmmakers on this one. As a fan, I give a fan's rating of 4 out of 5 stars, absolutely a must see for Dune fans who were disappointed in the original movie.",989193600,16,2670,4.406882591093117

Nevertheless, I had high hopes for this series, especially in terms of being true to the novel, which were dashed.
Glaring inaccuracies in novel-to-film adaptations make me nuts, and this has plenty of major problems, even to the point where actions taken by one character in the novel were taken by a completely different character in the film, such as the issue with the water at the dinner given by Duke Leto - in the film attributed to Jessica. The scene with the hunter-seeker was messed up, as well, and I wasn't happy with the scene with the gom jabbar.
Most unforgivable was the introduction of the emperor's daughter as a major character and influence - in the novel, she doesn't even appear until the end of the book!
At one point I thought I must be going nuts so I broke out the book and watched the movie with the book in hand to see if my memory was just completely wrong. It wasn't...but the movie was.
The movie might be enjoyable if you never read the book or read it long enough ago that the details have faded, or if you're not hung up on the fact that ""Frank Herbert's Dune"" should reasonably be expected to resemble the actual Frank Herbert's actual ""Dune"".",989107200,4,1300,4.466386554621849
1391446,1,B000053V8F,"Where can I begin? I've always loved David Lynch's version of this classic novel. I watched this version because I heard it was more complete and true to the book. I haven't read the book so I was hoping to get a wider perspective on the parts Lynch had to cut out.
Being a four and a half hour movie, it should have been twice as much movie as the original, but most of what was left out of Lynch's version was boring stuff. There were a few interesting revelations about the spice and the water of life. This movie also shed more light on the political situation. But there certainly wasn't four and a half hours worth of movie here.
The actors were very flat in their portrayal's of the characters. The only notable exceptions were Liet and Princess Irulan. And Paul's character got better as the story went along. His total lack of expression with the black box was quite apalling, however. Also, the voice was scarier and more convincing in David Lynch's version. Here it's kinda wimpy and spineless.
The costumes were cheesy to say the least. Especially the Bene Gesserit. The stillsuits may have been truer to the book, but they didn't look functional at all. The Fremin should have kept them on too, because most of the time they weren't wearing them. But they were still in the desert.
The worst part of this movie was the backgrounds. In virtually every scene there was a flat background. Especially in the desert, where the background was eight feet behind the actors, and the horizon was way too high. The backgrounds didn't even match the forground in most cases.
As for special effects, this was made in the year 2000 where we supposedly have technology. I've seen better effects in movies from the sixties. The dream sequences were pretty weak in this version too.",988761600,7,1779,4.615141955835962

So why is Paul kicking his feet up on tables on treating everyone like they're trash? This movie threw way to much crap in that needn't be there, where as the 1984 version left too much out.

I understand the problems that people have with that concerning plot changes, but I still think it, as a unique work, quite good.  The point being that I saw this version after the 1984 version and must compare the two.
It is fairly obvious that the makers of this film took great care to make a film very close to the original book.  It is in this that I say the movie did a good job.  However, some aspects of this film are lacking.  Particularly the sets and costumes.  The costumes are so gaudy it's almost impossible to get past them.  Now I realize that they are supposed to be a little over the top according to the book (which I have read), but this is just getting out of hand.  Same way with the sets.  Though the more low-key set designs are quite nice, the majority of them are so complex and out-landish that it nearly fries your retinas.  Put the sets and the costumes together and it literally looks like a technicolor yawn.
The special effects were for the most part well done, particularly the ships.  However, sometimes the landscape textures look a little flat, not enough bump to them.  Also, it was INCREDIBLY obvious that the outdoor desert shots and the shots in the siche were done in a studio with greenscreen and poorly rendered backdrops.  The overall effect was one of watching a live play.  In truth, they should have been shot on location, but I guess all the money for that was spent on giving people blue eyes.  But if you can get past the stage feel of it, then you should be okay.
What really killed this movie for me was the actors and acting.  Really, they were horrible.  Now William Hurt isn't a bad actor, but his comatose style is only good in certain situations, and this is not one of them.  Alec Newman, who played Paul Maud'Dib, looked way too old to play the young Duke, but later in the movie he grew into the role.  Ian McNeice did a stand up job as Baron Harkonnen, and Barbora Kodetova made a very alluring Chani (on an even par with Sean Young as the orignal), but all the rest of the cast just couldn't get their lines across well.  They are a poor substitute for the star-studded cast of the 1984 version.
But given all of the that, once Paul joins with the Fremen, things pick up, and aside from the poor desert shots, the film becomes enjoyable.  I don't think it is as good as the 1984 version, but those plot purists will definately go for this one over David Lynch's masterfully shot 2 hour story.  This one could have been better, and it could have been worse.  All in all, it isn't a bad way to kill 4 hours.",988502400,2,2644,4.296969696969697

Thsi is not to say its a perfect film.  Tehre are some scenes in the middle of the film where they clearly made due with inferior and obvious abckdrops to save a few bucks in production.  Also, someone should point the scene designer at the dictioanry definition of an ornithopter, as none of the vehicles in this movie were in fact ornithopters at all.

1391454,4,B000053V8F,"The chief complaints I have read about this sci-fi channel adaptation of Frank Herbert's classic novel, seem to spring from comparing it with David Lynch's cult classic film, rather than with the book itself.  Lynch's film, a classic in its own right, suffered from the studios insistence that it be no longer than two hours.  Dune is an epic and needed to be treated as such.  The miniseries format is uniquely suited to delivering complex, lenghty stories and, in that sense, this film holds up very well indeed.  I am a fan of long movies, that take time to tell a story and this four and a half hour adaptation seems just about right to me.  It is engrossing and exciting, at once epic and personal.  I was skeptical at first but, in the end, I was caught up and swept away by the story and the production.  For fans of good science fiction and good storytelling, this shouldn't be a disappointment.  That is not to say that there aren't problems.  Casting was sometimes questionable.  William Hurt seems barely conscious through his stint in the film.  And young Paul Atreides was played, at first, with such sleepy arrogance that I wanted to punch him about a hundred times in the head.  It soon becomes clear that this is a directorial choice, however, and the character eventually redeemed himself in my eyes.  The special effects range from merely acceptable to pathetic (Star Trek Next Generation was creating effects as good as this ten years ago.) And, perhaps worst of all, the entire production was filmed on soundstages, failing to capture even a hint of the epic wasteland that is Arrakis.  Still and all, this is an entertaining film, an eccellent story, well adapted.

But  when Frank Herbert wrote his epic visonary masterpeice  Dune science ficton got a much needed facelift. Frank's  vison was so ahead of it's time that it changed the way we look at science fiction forever an interglactic way of telling the ten commandments about a massiah that , would unite his people to uprise against an omiunent  force that would threaten the galaxy and the universe.
  When David Lynch did his motion picture version of  Dune it was huge spectacular , with huge grand sets and a gothic look and feel of the film that brought a style all to it's own , but because of the time refraints of  hollwood and movies it had to be shortend wich ment key parts of the movie were cut out. Seventeen years later  the Sci Fi channel took on yet another version of the respected science fiction masterpeice and DUNE was to  become a miniseries.
  In the televison version of DUNE portrays the same conflict the same charachters. But theres far more to the  story the story is not weak but the casting is weak the  way the production is weak , because of worries that to  much money would be spent and a cast of unknowns and  knowns including a very wooden Willam Hurt as Duke Leto Atradies. And some unknown guy for Paul who personally I, have never even heard of until this series came out.
  Combine that with the fact that Dune is sposed to be  made huge it's an epic powerful film. But the buget constraints show up in this version that obviously they wanted you to know it was made on a set because they sure didn't do a good job  covering it up. Borderlines where you can see the line of the  painted stills some very crapy , horrific lighting that more  or less gives it away even if in the story you can't enjoy a  resrained Dune like this a masterpeice because they were so worried about the buget they didn't even care to spend enough to make it satisfying enough , the planets have too peacful  of feeling to them the Harkonans are sposed to be menaceing  but here there peaceful. Feyd the son of Baron Harkonan looks like a feeble wimp where in the movie Sting made him work  because he was crazy with the role.
  All in all Frank Herbert would probly like the look and scale and scope of the film DUNE, but he would like the way  his story is treated in this version. If you want the size  and epic , specticale of DUNE definately the movie is your  best bet, but if you want storyline or book authenticity  this version is definately your best bet.

The only thing I didn't like at all was the Harkonnen house, the Baron was suppoused to be a disgusting being, here we have a choby man, that inspires compassion instead of repulsion. The movie version did a great job with the Harkonen house. By the other hand, the ship's scenes are great, specially with the Ornitopters.
 But not all the effects are cool, the scene when Paul sees the desert mouse (Muad'dib)is pathetic, the mouse is too unreal. But I have to recognize the Worms are great.
 So basically this movie is a good introduction to the Dune universe, gives you the desire to continue with the other books to know the whole story. I'd like to see other series based on the other books. The story of Leto II (son of Paul) is just fantastic, and people would have a chance to see Arrakis as a green planet at last.

Now we have John Harrison's 288-minute TV miniseries with more time, a more leisurely pace with which to deal with Frank Herbert's magnificent novel Dune. Did Harrison succeed?
Well, not quite. Let's start with the cast. William Hurt fails utterly as the charismatic Leto, who was supposed to be such an inspiring leader as to make his fighting men as good or better than the Emperor's crack troops, the Sardaukar. He is mild and lovable, but about as inspiring as milk and water. Boo. We get a slightly wimpy Jessica who is able to rise to the occasion once in a while, and a young pup of a Paul who never really hardens into the holy terror Muad'Dib.
The emperor's daughter, Princess Irulan, is turned into a viable character here, with excellent acting and credible changes to the novel to make her a vital player. Irulan is well acted, so are Chani, Alia, Liet, Rabban and other minor characters. Alas, the leads like Leto, the Baron, Feyd-Rautha, Paul and Jessica are not quite up to snuff.
What about the costumes, script, dialog, battles? The costumes are based on the Art Nouveau magnificence of Mucha and work well to convey the imperial feudal aspect. The worms are fabulous. Perfect in every way. The worm-riding scenes are as right as can be.
The dialog is a mish-mash of lines from the book and good condensation. There are absolutely perfect moments, generally near the end of the series, and others that make no sense unless you are steeped in Dune the novel and even then leave you flat. The best scene was probably the transformation of Jessica to Reverend Mother. That was done so well. Unfortunately, the rest doesn't come up to that level. So close...sigh.
The battle scenes were long and in some cases, downright stupid. At the end, the Fremen wield just their crysknives against the rapid fire weapons of the Sardaukar. Come on! Who brings knives to a gun fight!
Should you see it? Sure! If you love sci-fi, it's worth a look. Is it all one would hope for? Alas...no. I give it four stars no no cigars because it was an awfully good try.",987379200,2,2224,4.632911392405063

1391461,4,B000053V8F,"Dune has got to be the best science fiction story ever written. Rich in political, cultural and ecological detail, Dune won both the Hugo and Nebula awards for science fiction and remains one of the most highly-regarded novels of all time. Is it any wonder it has attracted two big productions? Now it must be said that there's no pleasing the purist's. But my hat is off to John Harrison for doing what Lynch wasn't allowed to do - tell a complete story. Harrison set out to adapt the novel as a miniseries and to recreate the novel's 3-act structure - each act would be told in a separate night of the miniseries. The production attracted great talent, including Giancarlo Giannini (Hannibal), and cinematographer Vittorio Stararo (Apocalypse Now). The result is an epic, 266-minute production. As far back as 1975, filmmakers struggled to bring Dune to the big screen. At one point even Ridley Scott was involved. Finally, in 1984, David Lynch delivered his own vision of the story to theaters which promptly bombed. While I really liked Lynch's look and feel of the world of Dune - the film's special effects were awful. Worse, in order to cram as much of the story into the film's 137 minutes as possible, important concepts in the novel were drastically altered or omitted entirely......
Fans of the David Lynch film will probably dislike Frank Herbert's Dune. For one thing, it has completely abandoned Lynch's dark look. Instead, this production is vibrant. To save money, and to create a unique look to the final project, the entire film was shot on soundstages. The result is a production with a decidedly theatrical feel. Unfortunatly, the CGI is pretty weak, even for TV. And what was up with those costumes? But these are small complaints, really. Very few story changes have been made in the adaptation of the novel for television (the major ones are that the character of Princess Irulan, who is the ""narrator"" of the novel, is a more important figure in the miniseries, and that Paul's internal monologue has been largely abandoned - the film works much better without it). Aside from the wooden William Hurt, the performances by the cast are great. They have a more theatrical flavor, but these characters seem far more rounded than those that populate the Lynch film. The standout is Ian McNeice as a wonderfully over the top Baron Vladimir Harkonnen. Though beautiful stage actress Barbora Kodetova simply IS Chani....Bottom line - put David Lynch out of your head, because while it isn't perfect, this version will probably be as good as get's. So enjoy it, people.
The DVD is presented in letterboxed widescreen. The production's lavish color scheme is well preserved here. The colors present in the costumes, lighting and production design are both bold and subtle at once - accurate, lush and stunning to look at. The contrast here is also excellent, with deep, detailed blacks. The audio on Dune's two discs is generally good. English-only audio is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 surround. It's full and somewhat atmospheric, and supports the video adequately. The major extra is a 25-minute featurette, called Frank Herbert's Dune: The Lure of Spice. It features good interview clips with the director, producers and various members of the cast & production crew. We see ""behind-the-scenes"" video shot during the making of the miniseries, and get a look at the amazing work of cinematographer Vittorio Stararo and production designer Miljen Kljakovic.",987120000,5,3476,4.984509466437177
1391462,3,B000053V8F,"I am convinced that there can never be a video version of ""Dune"" that truly captures the essense of the novel.  The question then becomes, can a video version of ""Dune"" stand as a good view in its own right.  The Sci-Fi channel's treatment of the story certainly looks good.  I was impressed by the visual effects and the costumes (although I probably stand alone on the latter point).  The pacing of the movie keeps one's interest from drifting at the cost of expounding on the finer points that gave the novel its distinctive flavor.  The one major drawback is the acting, or rather lack thereof.
Although the Lynch version had several bad points the intesity of the acting was not one of them.  In that movie, one could tell from the outset that Paul was special, Duke Leto was a man of heart and the Baron Harkonnen was loathsome.  In this version, the duke is bland and wooden, Paul is a spoiled brat and the Baron seems politely bored.  Where Lynch's Baron giggled with maniacal glee, in this film the Baron barely seems interested in Dune.  Paul's characterization suffers the most, however.  He begins the film as a spoiled brat and does a magical transformation to a leader seemingly overnight.  Worse yet, by the time he does he has  become so repulsive its hard to care.  Furthermore, there is no chemistry betwen him and the Duke, like two co-workers who recognize each other but don't interact.  Apparently the duke couldn't stand his whiny son either.

I appreciate many people didn't like David Lynch's vision of Dune (although I have no idea why), but at least the stillsuits in that looked more realistic.  The gaudy bright stillsuits from this production look like they wouldn't be able to stand a hot summers day, let alone the intense heat and sun of the Desert Planet.
Paul Attreides comes across like a spoilt brat with something to prove from his very first scene, something I couldn't fathom at all.

I got to see the David Lynch version--which Frank Herbert supposed helped create--and was stunned by its stiffness and gernerally proding story.  Years later, when the director's cut was released, the movie played a lot better...but not better than this version.
This version is extraordinary. I have watched it 3 times and each time I reveal in the beauty and excellent story telling. This is the book come to life in front of you! The people contributing to the film are first rate. I enjoyed the character transistion of Paul--and this most of all made this movie click for me. Paul matured in this film version. He goes from spoiled only kid to forceful leader and hero.
This version of Dune also brings to life the book's original narrator and observer.  Princess Irulan is wonderfully cast and this character's contribution to the overall story is fantastic.
I wish the makers of this version consider taking up some of the additional stories of Frank Herberts Dune--ChapterHouse was by far the most thrilling and imaginative!

Lynch is perfect for horror and mystery, but should stay away from dramatic Sci-Fi. This adaptation does away with 'creative license' such as 'heart plugs', reworking the Wierding Way as a sound weapon, pus sores on the Baron, and other Lynch style horror imagery.  Harrison also does not destroy the ending as Lynch does. This version, however, does have it's own draw backs.  Casting comes to mind.  William Hurt, usually a surpurb actor, was terribly miscast as the Duke.  His acting, for some reason, is lifeless and disappointing.  Also, the obvious reuse of some sets (while they are very beautiful) takes away somewhat from the visual impact.  The lack of hearing the characters thoughts (the one thing Lynch did well) causes the loss of some very important information as far as the characters go.

1391473,4,B000053V8F,"The toughest thing about reviewing this miniseries will be the fact
that Harrison stuck so close to the book (in composition) but failed
in casting appropriate personnel for costume and set design.  Now some
of the sets were okay.  The inside of the palace at Arakeen was
beautiful, but didn't improve on the Lynch's movie set in my book.
Contrary to some beliefs, I think that William Hurt did a good job.
He is a HUGE Dune fan himself and has read the books time and again,
so I feel that he understood how to react as the Regal Duke who
sacrifices himself for the good of his family and his royal house.  He
is somewhat depressed by this (as he shows us) but is also forced
forward by things beyond his control.
The costumes: Well they
tried.  The head-dresses were a little over the top for my taste
(especially for Helen Gauis Mohiam) who looked like a giant butterfly
had landed on her head.  The Lynch version showed the Aba robes of the
Bene Geserit sisterhood in a dark-light, indicating backroom deals but
incredible elegance (note in the Lynch version how the robe of the
Emperor's truthsayer flows magically as she is asked to leave the
thrown room in the beginning when the Guild Navigator arrives).  I
didn't mind the stillsuits in either version and thought that both did
a good job on different aspects (the Lynch version looking like a
'pumping-type' suit in Herbert's vision versus the face flap in the
Harrison version that was lacking in the Lynch movie).
For purity,
I think that this Harrison miniseries blows the Lynch version out of
the water, however.  Harrison seemed almost anal in his 'sticking true
to the book' version.  There were no 'weirding modules' like in the
Lynch version (where the heck did he come up with that anyway?).
Harrison showed us the vision of Frank Herbert, but if you hadn't read
the book I feel that much might have been lost (for instance when
Dr. Kynes asks Paul about who helped him on with his stillsuit for the
first time and Dr. Kynes just stares at Paul for a while...there's a
lot going on there that's not being said).
The Guild Heighliners
in both versions held up well in my opinion.  Both seemed futuristic
and real.  The Guild Navigator in Lynch's version looked more
worm-like however, versus Harrison's version that looked more like a
giant bat.  But the bluer eyes of the Harrison navigator held truer to
Herbert's vision.
The worms in the Harrison version were better,
hands down.  When I first saw the worm taking down the spice harvester
in Harrison's version I was highly impressed.  And the 'thopters' in
the Harrison version seemed to hold truer to Herbert's version as
well, versus the flying machines in Lynch's version.
And the ending
of Harrison's version held to the book precisely versus the Lynch
version ...
Good and bad from both versions I guess is what I'm
trying to say.  Neither got it perfectly, but if you are a Dune
'purist' I think you'll like the Harrison miniseries better.  If
you're a movie buff, the Lynch version will probably standout for you",985996800,111,3041,4.657943925233645
1391474,5,B000053V8F,"Some people don't like the costumes, whose occassional hats are pretty outlandish.  Some don't like the casting, which includes a whiney Paul and a subdued Duke Leto.  But if one looks beyond that, one sees a rather impressive and unusual thing: a movie that accurately reflects the books.  There is little added, and anything that is is minor.  There are a few things left out, but one is hard-pressed to choose a scene to delete to make room for anything that wasn't included.  Given that this was a made-for-TV movie, I think it is a phenominal achievement in translating book to screen.
That having been said, there are things not to like.  Tactics that are only marginally better than those in Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (I won't call it Heinlein's Starship Troopers), bad hats, sound stage rather than on-location, and acting that, at times, is questionable.  Lastly, this is a movie for those who read the books.  I imagine that some who have not read the books may be confused by a great deal of things in the movie.

Costumes, well I don't think that I'm qualified to speak of things that lived in Frank Herbert's imagination, but I don't think the costume designer does either.
The visuals were great, between opticals, SFX, and CG they did a great job.  The only things lacking were adequate acting skills from the ensemble and adequate directing.

I just purchased ...  the DVD version of the Dune TV series.  It is pretty good?  Must less ""gory"" than the 1984 movie version and much longer in total hours (6 hours for the TV show vs 2.5 hour for the movie version).
The longer time allows one to bond better to the characters and special effects are pretty good (all CGI).
The only down side is that the eyes of Freemen are sometimes blue, then white again.  The other is some minor plots lines left out and there is no effort to decribe the very complicated world of the Empire (ya just hav' ta read the bloody book).

There are so many things that Lynch got wrong that Harrison got right but I won't go into them here.  Just read the book again and you will see what a great adaption this was.

While David Lynch's movie lacked much of the story of Herbert's book, and made some rather liberal changes, it did stand on it's own.  Harrison's Dune is an excellent addition to the book, but without knowledge of the book, it's a confusing mess.
The main flaw of Harrison's work can be summed up in one word:  characterization.  Who were all these people?  Dr. Yueh seemed to be a walk on cameo.  The same for Thufir.  Idaho showed up a little more, but we still have no idea who he is.  Even the lead characters--Paul, Leto, Jessica, the Baron--are all just thrown into the story, with no information given on why they are what they are.  John Harrison should have fought for one more episode (taking the runtime to 6 hours), and given us more insight into the characters.
As much as some of the backdrops were jarring, I can't really complain.  I know the budget was lacking, and the other effects (especially interior shots and the worms) were just amazing.  This is probably the one flaw of the DVD, though--the transfer quality is so good, the cloth backdrops on the desert scenes do look like, well, cloth...
I do applaud Harrison for sticking to the original story quite a bit, though.  Where Lynch's Dune was a Messianic story, Harrison's Dune gave us a little insight into the ""Manufactured Messiah"" of the original book.

Although the costumes were at times over the top, especially when it came to headgear. In particular, the Saldukar tended to look like a band of evil chefs. The acting was not as good either. In the first episode the cast seemed a little stiff and wooden. As the series goes on they seem to ease into their roles more or perhaps I just didn't notice it as much once I got into the story. Since the series was filmed in Czech Republic, many of the actors are not American. There are British, Irish, Scottish, German, Italian, Czech and French actors in the mix. Although this gives the film an exotic touch it makes some of the dialogue difficult to understand and without subtitles, I found I was constantly rewinding to hear dialogue that I missed. Some of the dialogue sounded muffed too, or was that the accents?, and I had to have the volume way up from where I usually set it. The DVD special features were adequate. A good 30-minute documentary with brief interviews with the cast and crew is included. Cast and Crew biographies are included but with notable omissions such as the actress that plays Chani, although she gives a brief interview in the documentary.

The plus side: great computer-generated effects, many of the actors do a fine job, and it manages to communicate some of the feel of the ""Dune"" universe.  The downside: Terribly fake background paintings, outdoor scenes that are very obviously on a soundstage (and not a very big one), some of the actors do horrible jobs, the costumes are appalling (apparently, in the future we'll all be wearing GIANT hats),the majority of the actors are foreign which is not in and of itself a bad thing, but with so many different accents the movie begins to feel disjointed and confused. I would single out William Hurt as the main offender for poor performance, he walks through his pivotal role like he's been sedated.  The DVD itself is somewhat disappointing, on 2 discs they've only put one ""making-of"" documentary (which is essentially a collection of interviews, with no real delving into the effects or the philosophy of the book), a few sketchbook drawings and photos and an extremely difficult to read and dull treatise from the visual director.

1391484,3,B000053V8F,"There's plenty to like about the latest screen incarnation of Frank Herbert's Dune.  There are also several areas in which this version comes up short.  Overall, it's worth seeing, but it isn't spectacular.
We see more of the story with this Dune than we do in the big-screen version.  Crucial scenes like Paul's first fight to the death do a lot for character development.  Many transitions that are skipped over on the big screen are handled adequately here.  Also, there is more of an earthy tone to the film, which may be as much a reflection of the budget as a deliberate device of the creative team.
There's also a strong theme of clashing cultures that wasn't as apparent on the big screen.  Sets, costuming, and a handful of well-chosen scenes make the world of the Emperor, the Great Houses, and the Guild into Europe.  The Arabesque nature of the Fremen, which comes across so clearly in the book, is played up much better.  One can easily see the parallels between the struggle over the spice and the European/Middle Eastern situation regarding oil.
Unfortunately, the small screen version seems, well, small when compared with its predecessor.  The performances of the big screen actors simply tower over what we're seeing on TV.  By comparison, Harrison's characters are quite mundanely represented.  In fact, everything is smaller and duller, so the overall production is far less exciting than Lynch's version.  If you can look beyond the lessened excitement factor, though, Harrison's version has some good things to say.

Finally, the disc is lacking extra footage that was cut from the US TV version of the mini-series to accomodate commercial breaks, rumored to be about 20 minutes of additional material.
Supposedly, this ""Director's Cut"" version of the Dune mini-series is owned by a German company who wanted quite a bit of money for its' use in the U.S.  According to the series' production company, New Amsterdam Entertainment, it is quite likely that a ""Collectors Edition"" of Dune will be released at some point in the future with the longer version of the series and a 5.1 soundtrack.

But, it left out or downplayed several key elements which I thought important to show the depth of the characters, their motives, and the complexity of the political situations Frank Herbert described in his book. The major elements are: Mentats, Thufir Hawat's part, Piter DeVris' part, Suk school conditioning, Sietches were inside caves with moisture seals, and a few others.  This one did a much better job in portraying The Baron Harkonnen, Paul's life with the fremen and how the book really ended.  Here's how to get the best movie out of both versions that have been made:  Use the actors (except for the Baron), costume design (except for the Baron), and the first half of the David Lynch version. Use the special effects and the second half of the new Dune mini-series. I also suggest reading the book to see the differences for yourself.

For all these reasons  you should purchase it. But be advise, it has also some downsides. Some characters are slightly modifed,the interface between the live characters and the computer generated images is at times sluggish and some aspects of the political arena and history are left behind, loosing some of Dune flavor. Some of facts mentioned previosly by the author of the first review are correct, some things are better in linch's version,like the cast and the stillsuits but not many.

The movie was so terrible in  its execution that I wanted to turn it off half way in.  Yes the characters fit there profiles.  Yes the movie follows the book to its entirety but everything else about it is second rate.  THe acting is terrible,  the costumes are terrible, the setting is terrible.  NOTHING about the movie gives ARRAKIS the vast dangerous feel that the book did.

Lynch's dark version (the older movie) was an interesting work, but never came close to illustrating the story that Herbert wrote.  Secondly, truth is not always a function of fiction, however this rendition's faithfulness to the original story is most admirable.  The fabrications protrayed by Lynch, again an interesting work, was not what Herbert wrote for his readers.  The Harkonnens were treacherous and lecherous, but not medically grotesque.  The Bene Gesserit were mysterious philosophical-descendants of an old mother faith, but not dark or evil.  In summary, this newer mini-series has much to share with old fans of the series (the books, not the Lynch movie), as well as for newcomers to the universe of the Atreides!",984355200,10,888,5.35251798561151

1391496,2,B000053V8F,"If the only purpose of this version of Dune was simply to be more faithful to the plot of the novel, more thorough, it may have succeeded there and only there. Otherwise, compared to the David Lynch version, its ersatz quality shows in the worst way. The David Lynch version was brilliant as a cinematic interpretation of the Herbert novel, operating on a level of artistic force and intensity evidently quite foreign to the new TV version. This new version comes off as a dull documentary by comparison. Yes the Lynch film took considerable liberties, and it remains the best film version for those who have not read the novel precisely because it inspires the viewer to read the book, whereas the same cannot said for the TV version.
The Lynch version remains unchallenged in its interpretation of the characters, setting, costumes, and speech of the original epic. The Lynch Harkonnen, as the perverse postmodernist punks, the dark distant strangeness of the Bene Gesserit, the mysterious and desperate spacing guild (as well as the convincingly bizarre navigator), were all unforgettable in the original film. There was something curiously familiar in the the Lynch interpretation, an aesthetic for his time that makes it a good cult film candidate. It's in part because Lynch avoided the now familiar TV stereotype aliens (Star Trek, etc) that we will remember the original as a genuine contribution. The Sci-fi version unfortunately contributes nothing in these areas but instead relies on re-use of jejune TVland sets and outrageous, not to mention flamboyant fruitcake costumes, as well as adding a little corny populism to the screenplay.",983923200,7,1647,5.12639405204461
1391497,2,B000053V8F,"Let me begin by saying that it has been quite some time since I have read the original Dune.  This may be why the movie seemed so distant from the book to me.  I must also say that I liked the Lynch version of the film.  Those things said, here goes.
I don't remember the book being about Chani and Irulan.  I can appreciate the modern need to portray women stronger, but these two were not the crux of the story.  Irulan was barely mentioned short of the chapter intros in the book, but became the focal point and sacrificial lamb of the mini-series. I thought the story was about the rise of a messiah.  Am I wrong?  It seemed to me to that Paul was playing second fiddle (badly playing...).  Paul was not a whiny brat, he was the duke to be, and acted as such.
I must also agree that costuming was ridiculous.  The lack of stillsuits was particularly annoying.
Did Paul and Chani have two sons named Leto???  I feel stupid if they actually had a son that died in the book, but the only Leto II I remember was a twin and God Emperor.  How can they do this?  They tried to make you feel more sorry for Chani and demolished the story.  This made me want to stop watching completely.
I was also very frustrated by the comic book feel of the entire show.  Baron Harkonnen comes across as a member of the Legion of Doom from Super Friends, rather than a sadistic, cruel dictator.
Why can't anyone do this right?  Where are all of the religious undercurrents and biblical allegories?
Take my advise.  If you don't like the Lynch, then just read the books.  Use your imagination and Herbert's brilliance to get a great story rather than relying on half-hearted attempts at films to know this story.",983923200,9,1693,4.357827476038339
1391498,5,B000053V8F,"First of all, and to me perhaps the most important change of all, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (sp?) lost the pulsing sores from the original.  The original version of Dune was certainly not improved by that nauseating addition, and its deletion from the second work greatly enhanced the viewing experience. Second, Princess Irulan was more than a decoration, which, while not in line with the book, was fitting of the Bene Gesserit-trained heir to Shaddam IV's throne, and, while she wasn't a major character, the closing scene was perhaps one of the two or three best I've ever seen, on the big or the little screen. Third, Lady Jessica was shown as a much stronger character than she was in the original.  This is more in line with the book series, and makes her a much more interesting character.  In the original, she was shown as a whining, wilted flower, and in the books, she is far more strong and complex than that. Fourth, Duke Leto was much more subtle than he was in the original movie.  I see this as an improvement as well, since the Atreides style of leadership is based more on finesse and inspiration than the almost Harkonnen-esque brashness shown by Jurgen Prochnow in the original movie.  William Hurt's Duke Leto allowed his actions to speak for him and inspire his troops with their sheer nobility. Since I'm running out of space, I'll summarize the rest.  Fifth, Paul Muad'dib was more human.  Sixth, this version's Chani was more believeable as a desert dweller than Sean Young.  Seventh, the Fremen had a much greater Middle-Eastern influence in their wardrobes and appearance.  Finally, the music, effects, and sandworms were better. In short, this is much, much better than the original, and I rate it as the best, truest adaptation of a book in the history of film.",983577600,8,1794,4.7799352750809065

When I try to play the older movie at home my wife is totally disgusted by much of Harkonen's actions (many of the disgusting segments weren't even in the book in the first place-like spitting on Lady Jessica's eye).  In response to the previous reviewer who thinks that anyone who likes this new version is uneducated etc., who do you think you are?  To imply that someone is uneducated because they like something that you do not is a truly uneducated remark.

1391500,3,B000053V8F,"As some of my ""colleagues"" have said before, you can't expect Hollywood (or cable TV)to hit it on the head 100%. Changes are to be expected, as are omitions. Let's face it, this story is almost too big for any film or television portrayal.  We just have to hope and pray that enough integrity is retained to make this incarnation worthwhile. Is is the science-fiction enthusiasts who cringe in fear when it is announced that our most beloved stories and characters will be represented on large or small screens. Too often we see the efforts come up short. Thus is our fate. To Hollywood, science fiction is more eye-candy than art. It's nice to see that the sci-fi cahnnel had their hearts in the right place with this one. The characters are competently performed.  Chani and Stilgar shine.  While I found the Baron more annoying than threatening, I appreciated that he was portrayed as a cunning strategist, than simply a babbling psychopath.  A big thanks for bringing out the political drama. The Lynch movie was way too vague as to the reasons why the Atreides were being sent to Dune in the first place. Also, applause for returning the weirding way to it's original maifestation as a method, not a tangible weapon. And finally, the eye candy is delightful. Of course as CGI technology has progressed, it was only to be expected. The sandworms are outstanding. The blue-eyed effect is also much more striking.",982713600,,1415,4.786885245901639

1391502,4,B000053V8F,"We are a perverted group, we fans of Sir Frank's Epic. No film will EVER be ""just right"" but this new version comes so very much closer than Mr. Lynch's previous effort. (I can remember nearly having a fit when it rained at the end, a cinematically licensed plot jump that I felt was unforgiveable.) Yes, True Blue Fans, it has its faults but it also has its wonderful and pure moments.
But understand why we love this Epic Saga so much; its scope is nearly unmatched in its genre, encompassing millions of worlds in a richly colored tapestry of awe-filled (sometimes awesome, sometimes awful) events. Good God, it took 3 writers, including his talented son, Brian, to even extend the story!
For the diehard Dune fan(atic), this attempt will no doubt contain a tinge of melancholy but also the added flavor of once again seeing this wonderful story brought to life. We must understand that there is just so much time to tell a story this vast, with so much charaterisation, with so many ""wheels within wheels"" without losing the intiate altogether.
For those who haven't read the book(s), this movie is a wonderful introduction into the Dune Universe. It does a more-than-admirable job of introducing the characters, their settings and their agendas, although the true flavor and depth of some remain to be discovered in reading the books. It is beautifully filmed with sets to rival anything yet seen, even on the Big Screen.
You can cry if you want to that some minor characters did not get the treatment they deserved. And Linda Hunt would have made a better choice than John Hurt as Duke Leto Atreides (Jesus, he was better than this in ""Lost In Space""!) but thankfully, he dies early in the film (about 5 seconds after he comes on screen, if you ask me).
All in all, a delightful romp through one of the Tried & True Masterpieces of Modern Literature. Maybe now someone will tackle the second book?",982368000,25,1903,4.683582089552239
1391503,4,B000053V8F,"After seeing this miniseries and the original David Lynch theatrical release, I felt compelled to read the book and settle some plot inconsistencies (i.e. where did the weirding weapons go and where the heck was Duncan Idaho really supposed to die? In the Atreides compound during the initial Harkonnen attack or blown to bits by Harkonnen patrols in the desert spiriting Paul and his mother to safety?). The Sci-Fi series got it right.
I did not find Allec Newman annoying as some people did. Sure, he was wooden, but Paul was schooled in the controlling of his own emotions by his mother so that they did not betray him. After the Harkonnen attack his ruthless, unemotional behavior became more pronounced as he was immersed in the grim Fremen culture.
In terms of following the original story, the Sci-Fi Channel series is superior to Lynch's version. Sure, nobody seems to be able to get the fact that Paul Atreides is supposed to be 14-15 when the story starts and that he is described as being much darker complected than either actor who has played him in the past, but things actually happened in the sequence they were supposed to in the miniseries. People die where they are supposed to and events take place in the proper sequence.
Another nice element of the miniseries was the use of knives. Everybody has knives in the miniseries, just like in the book, where knives play an important part of Fremen culture. In the miniseries, characters are more likely to duke it out up close with knives than shoot blasts from weirding modules (which aren't even in the book).
Karel Dobry's Dr. Kynes and P.H. Moriarty's Gurney Halleck (characters who, despite their importance to Herbert's original story, were glossed over in Lynch's version of ""Dune"") are both given the attention they deserve in the miniseries. I thought both actors did well, as did the actor who played Stilgar (Uwe Ochsenknecht). I liked both Ochsenknecht and Dobry's quiet, understated menace. Despite their lack of emotion and stoic demeanor, you could instantly recognize them as the most dangerous men in the room. In the miniseries Gurney Halleck looks and feels like the battle-hardened ex-slave who would die for his Duke. If anything, Patrick Stewart's portrayal in the movie (when his character was on screen) was too ""clean"" to be Gurney Halleck.
Hey, Raban even had some dialogue in the miniseries (like he did in the book) instead of wandering around and giggling perversely while eating some indescribable meat product like he did in Lynch's movie. Feyd even gets to do things in the miniseries besides offering Sting's characteristic leer of the Lynch interpretation. Sure, his clothes stunk in the miniseries, but he was shown as being much more dangerous (both physically and mentally) in the miniseries than Sting was in the movie version. Stepping out of a steam-bath and cocking on eyebrow on cue don't concern me as much as the man who looks harmless and has terrible fashion sense, but is a cold-blooded killer. Ian McNiece surprised me as Baron Harknonnen, since I'm used to him in more effeminate, comedic roles. I thought he did a fine job as the Baron, mixing the vicious with the pathetic (now if only I hadn't seen quite so much of him wearing nothing but his suspensor harness...).
The miniseries does have its weaknesses. Once again, the actor who played Yueh fell short. I never once saw the tattoo Yueh had on his forehead that signified his imperial conditioning. How many times is this blasted tattoo mentioned in the book? William Hurt has as much intensity as a corpse. I do think that Lynch's movie made the Bene Gesserit more menacing with their bald heads and black gowns. The Bene Gesserit attire of the miniseries was laughable. In fact, hats were pretty terrible throughout the series. I also like Lynch's interpretation of guild navigators and Harkonnen ""garbage bags with green eyeholes"" shock troops. However, other visual elements, like the stillsuits (the primary wardrobe of the second half of the story) and vehicles, are more accurate in the Sci-Fi miniseries.
Is it perfect? No. Was it enough to cause me to buy a copy of the book to find out if they did a better/worse job? Yes. Is it more faithful to the original story? Yes.",981936000,386,4252,4.8662068965517244

It completly lacks any of the book and first movies flavor.  It took way too many liberties with costumes and key concepts from the book.  I mean paul didn't learn what the Kwisatz Haderach was until like the 3rd hour, while he learned that in the first chapter in the book.  Another thing that completly annoyed me was that they left out the mentats all together making Thufar Hawats role absoultley usless.  And what about the suks.  They only mentioned Suk conditioning once and didn't bother to explain what it was.  As a whole the  entire thing was anti-climatic and the only good character in this version was the little girl who played Alia.  The other thing that bothered me was when Paul and Jessica fled into the desert and encoutered the Fremen, Stilgar said ""You are fugitives from the Harkonnen and Will be from us too.""  I almost fell out of my chair when I heard this. It should have been: ""Any Enemies of the Harkonnen are friends of ours""  (This is from memory so it could be alittle different) As a whole the fremen were supposed to be viscious and pragmatic, yet this version only portraid them as whiny peasants.

I can't decide if the casting was atrocious or if the actors should have their vocal chords removed before they mutilate something else. Then again, it may have been the writers and producers.
I think the title of this rant says it all. Not only did Jessica succumb to morning sickness, but Paul was positively petulant. Baron Harkonnen was not fat or gross. The stilsuits, when even in evidence, were poorly constructed. Where were the catch tubes?
Okay, so you think I'm nitpicking about a director's ""poetic license"". These people changed integral parts of the story for NO GOOD REASON!!!  What needed to change about the opening ""Arrakis...Dune...Desert Planet""? They made Emperor Shaddam IV a pathetic puppet of Count Fenrig. Worst of all, Feyd was sleeping with Irulan, for Bog's sake!
The beauty of Dune, the book, and even Dune the doomed Kyle McLaughlan version, was the plans within the plans and the extra-ordinariness of people 10,000 years from now. That earlier big-screen version was full of pagentry and pomp and danger and meticulous attention to areas of the book which a fan could not help to note. For example, the first movie showed the scars from nose plugs in the men's beards. In this version, some of the Fremen were actually clean shaven. And for the love of little green apples, one does NOT picnic in the open desert!!!

How the Fremen remain masters of stealth with eyes that glow in the dark? Why did the Baron have to rhyme his last line before every commercial break?

1391516,4,B000053V8F,"Dune is a novel such complexity that it can never actually be correctly adapted without a monolithic budget and a near infinite timescale. The primary problem presented by the novel for conversion to a visual medium is the incredibly rich world of Dune as seen through the minds of its characters. It's technological ideas and concepts have never been fully realized on a screen.
But what about the remake and what it got right? What it really estblished well were the atmospheres of the great houses. You could sense the narcisism of Corrino, the sadism of the Harkonnen, and the subtly manipulated altruism of the Attreides. William Hurt and Sasskia reeves give wonderful performances as Duke Leto and his bound concubine, the Lady Jessica. Alec Newman's Paul is overly defiant throughout the first half of the movie. I know the director/writer probably felt this would give depth to the evolution he undergoes during the second half of the story, but I heard vague echoes of Luke railing against his uncle Ben because he wanted ""to go to Toshi station and pick up some power converters."" Paul was enamored and fascinated with his father, not frustrated by him.
The true accomplishment of the miniseries cannot be appreciated without having read the books. There are many subtle moments of implied subtleties that could only be noticed by someone well acquainted with the Dune universe.

While this version is in fact longer don't get your hopes up. Instead of exanding the story to include more elements of the novel or even a hint at the things to come in the second book, Dune Messiah, the film wastes time with such trashy added bits as a seduction scene between the Emperor's daughter and the Harkonnen baron's son.

All Lynch is guilty of is unfulfilled ambitition - a trap succumbed to by many filmmakers who attempt to bring a complex and original novel to the screen.  Are there problems with Lynch's version?  Absolutely.  But at least it gets to the soul of the story - and Kyle Maclachlan had a lot to do with it.
The supposed advantage of this new series, which appeared on Sci-Fi, is that it is comprehensive.  It is also boring and poorly acted.  And I, for one, found the special effects to be worse than some of the better video games I have played on my PC.  (A notable exception - the sandworms, which were done well).
Fans of books invariably tear apart movie adaptations - but movies are a different endeavor, never truly meant to capture all of the nuances of the written word.  The reason Lynch's version is better is that it gives insights, internal monologues, feelings - the hallmarks of the novel.  For goodness' sake - in this version, I hardly knew which person was playing Yueh (a pretty essential character, I would say).

The costumes were more believable, the special effects, pound-for-pound, were MUCH better, and the characters were more believable as actual human beings, rather than comic book villains and super heroes. And unlike the 1984 movie, this Dune ACTUALLY MADE SENSE.

I was overjoyed to see some of my favorite moments from the book-the changing of the water, Feyd's gladiatorial contests, and Paul's fight with Jamis. Also, the film was beautiful! The colors were rich and deep for the Harkonnens implying decadence and luxury, while the Fremen colors were bleached and pale. This made the Fremen's blue eyes stand out very well.
As I watched though, annoying little things began to creep up on me. For one, the pronunciation of HARkonen irritated me to no end!  It seemed that the director was trying so hard to avoid any similarities to Lynch's movie that even pronunciations had to change. Lines of dialog which Lynch took straight from the book were reworked in this movie to be subtly different, losing some of their original flow and meaning.
One more thing, Paul Atreidies is a jerk! The character was portayed as strong and old for his age, but there were no contrasting HUMAN emotions to identify with. I daresay he didn't smile or cry once. In fact, no other emotions cracked that arrogant, cold visage at all. Ack!

Be that as it may, ""Dune"" clearly suffers from the restrictions of the TV-format. In other words money. An epic like ""Dune"" cannot be done (well) on a TV-budget. Sad but true. The computer generated scenes/backgrounds look cheap in most cases. Only a few of the flight-scenes look OK. Actors are another issue. Less money means worse actors. William Hurt (who plays Duke Leto Atreides) is - of course - one of the few exceptions.
There are two reasons why I give it two stars instead of one. Firstly, some of the fight-scenes look pretty good. Secondly, adapting a 'inaccessible' story like ""Dune"" to the screen is bold. And bold TV/movie projects should be rewarded because in these days they are rare.
If you want a accurate adaption of the book by Frank Herbert - buy this one. If you want a good movie - get the one by David Lynch.",980208000,4,954,4.457142857142857
1391522,1,B000053V8F,"To make a faithful version of Herbert's novel would take more like 20 hours than six.  The viable options are to do a movie that captures the essence of the book (which Lynch partly succeeded in doing, as Frank Herbert himself said a number of times, as did  Harlan Ellison)--or do a really faithful adaptation, which takes time.
It also takes somebody who isn't trying to turn the opportunity to adapt the novel into a chance to make a TV movie franchise for himself, which Harrison was clearly trying to do.  Most of his interviews have been sly excuses for self promotion at Lynch' expense.
There are no excuses for the kinds of changes Harrison makes.  Most of the stuff people complain about in the Lynch film is just visual flourish.  The weirding modules, rain on Arrakis, etc.  Harrison goes in and changes the characters themselves, and basically makes up a new Irulan, when there are existing characters in the novel who could show us the Imperial court more effectively.  Clearly, Harrison was trying to put his own stamp on the story, to take it over.  In essence, Harrison is acting as if he's a better director than David Lynch and a better writer than Frank Herbert.
He is neither.
Those who give Harrison slack because he didn't have as much money as Lynch should give Lynch slack because he didn't have as much time--he made a much longer movie than the one we saw which was cut to ribbons by the producer, and then restored in a version he didn't approve).  Harrison, OTOH made the film he wanted to make, and this boring turgid piece of sludge is the rather sad result.

Another complaint, I guess, would be that (again) the Harkonnens are depicted as simple buffoons.  I must have read a different book than the directors of both movies.

I saw it at first as a Dune ignorant person, and it by itself is great. But when paired with the book, it's almost as close as the Lord of the Rings movie will be. I didn't notice much of the music, because I was paying too much attention to the story. The acting is above-average, the costumes are great (I love the sandworm riding Maud'Dib!).

This version followed the 1984 version fairly closely but expanded on the story a bit more.  I have not read the original book, so I am not sure how accuarate it follows the book.  While following the plot of the original almost verbatum, they would embelish what would be going on in between the scenes from the original.
Being filmed in this generation of film technology, this mini-series featured all new special effects as today's audience would expect.  However, the reason I gave it 4 stars is that some of the live-action sets looked like small soundstage sets with fake green screen backgrounds.  But of course being a ""made-for-TV"" production, I can overlook that.
The sand worms were improved since the 1984 version.  Same basic look, but more intricate detail in the mouth area.  The costumes were pretty good, however I liked the '84 costumes better with the exception of the Fremen.  The large indoor sets were very well done.
The casting in this series was not bad, but it wasn't spectacular.  The only main-line actor was William Hurt.  However the guy they got to play the Baron was very good counterpart to the '84 actor.

It runs the starships and gives the society an industry it depends on.
In the film there was too much territory covered in too short a period. The characters were too rapidly introduced.  The new version gives us a glimpse of what inspired the Star Wars myths.

John Harrison shows true affection for Frank Herbert's original material, both in his screenplay adaptation and in his direction, but there are times when budget constraints are painfully obvious.
Overall it is a fair adaptation and probably more faithful than David Lynch's 1984 version, but, like Lynch, Harrison fails to make the film completetly accessible. The Dune mini-series can be enjoyable without reading the Herbert's novel, but it is best appreciated by comparison to the narrative of the novel.
The acting throughout is adequate overall, but I missed Sting as Feyd Harkonnen. I really liked William Hurt and Alec Newman (Duke Leto and Paul) who both did a fine job embodying their characters, but I found Giancarlo Giannini (Emperor Shaddam IV), Ian McNeice (Baron Harkonnen) and Saskia Reeves (Lady Jessica) unconvincing.
The setting and scenery in the first two-hour episode were fantastic, but all of the desert and siech sets were dissappointing - the matte paintings they used as backdrops in many of these sets were obvious and jarring. The cinematography and camerawork, however, were consistently well handled.

In fact, the novel is one of the most brilliant exercises in the medium of writing ever.  There is nothing that has such an awesome thematic and epic scope.  But this film is NOT a great film.  The greatest adaptations, a transfer of the tones and feelings of a work in one medium to another, are the ones that abandon what confined the work in the source medium and allow the other medium to embrace it with its own equal but different qualities.  This miniseries was a complete disappointment because it was not Dune as a film, but rather a stage version that seemed to be shot in one performance.  For being a brilliant and imaginative piece of science fiction, this film has no visual enginuity at all.  It is monotonous and the director, who is very self rituous about making a definative Dune, has absolutely no vision at all. Herbert's vision does not need to be completely reiterated.  the work stands alone.  So why then even make a film?  Because it is a way to convey the scope and power in a different medium, creating a sister experience that enhances the other.  There is no passion or aesthetic in this Dune.  It is a staging, like a book on tape version, making it wholly unnecessary.  It has everything in the novel but its drive, its conviction, and its power.  What bothers me the most is that film is a perfect medium to convey the subtleties and themes of this story.  Imagine what a visionary director could do with the consciousness-expanding moments in this work.  the novel tells us what drinking the water of life did, we do not need it to be read to us by an actor, a film can make us experience it, and allow us to ponder it.  Lynch's version, however different from what many imagined as the Padishah Empire, took these risks, and for that, his work remains the film to see, and experience.  Oh by the way, the portrayal of Paul was terrible (as if he was cast because he was a Mark Hamill look a like) as were the battle scenes. Dull and mostly concocted of reused and reused stock footage.  Also, for being nearly 6 hours, it did not take its time with the characters and their emotions.

In short, what wasn't butchered in the script, was butchered on the screen.  Paul comes across as a whiney, insensitive bastard...  and Chani as positively vapid.
Visually, the mini-series paled in comparison to David Lynch's previous interpretation...  Unfortunately, fifteen years of technological advancement seemed lost on this film.  It was hard to take the film seriously when most of what you noticed was where the effects were lacking...  This production probably never left a sound stage and was unable to adequately disguise that fact.
Finally, and most disappointingly, was the obvious poor costuming and visual character interpretation.  The once frightening Harkonnens were dressed in costumes that made them look more like M.C. Hammer's backup dancers complete with Manic Panic fluorescent red hair.  The Emperor looked less like a distinguished leader and more like Rip Taylor in a huge multi-colored pastel lame outfit, complete with belled sleeves.
I felt like I was watching a cheap Vegas revue!
Overall, this film left me with an increased respect for David Lynch's version.",976060800,12,1637,5.334630350194552
1391541,4,B000053V8F,"John Harrison's interpretation of Herbert's Dune was well done, with a visually spectacular display of special effects. The large use of computer generated animation allowed Harrison to produce scenes that before were only locked in the reader's imagination. Overall the series was fairly faithful to Herbert's work, but I felt there were several key character misinterpretations. For example, the Lady Jessica who was portrayed as an emotional character often losing physical control of herself, i.e. crying, was directly in opposition to her Bene Gesserit training. There were other flaws and additional dialogue that strayed from the novel, but Harrison has presented by far the most accurate screen portrayal of Herbert's Dune to date. I especially enjoyed his effort to bring Paul's visions to the screen, this being an important aspect of Herbert's novel and was severely lacking in Lynch's film. I recommend this film to any true Dune fan.",976060800,,946,5.355704697986577
1391542,4,B000053V8F,"This was an excellent adaptation of the book.  Sure there were a few discrepencies between the two but it is still much better than the David Lynch versio, (which even he did not like).  Certainly Paul might seem a bit whiny, but in the book he was only 14 or 15, and he was being forced with a major relocation, and he whined, like he did in the book.  Certain scenes were added and other removed, but this is done with all movies, it has to. You can't get 800 pages of writing into six hours of tv and still make it coherent.  I recommend reading the book, and seeing this miniseries.  Then make your own decision.",976060800,2,616,4.230769230769231
1391543,3,B000053V8F,"As a Dune fan I found the mini-series acceptable and quite fun to watch. It is less visual than the Lynch movie, but the plot was closer to the book. At 6 hours the mini-series doesn't have time to develop the full plot of the book. I found myself shouting at the screen a few times when I felt important information was left out or modified.
The whole political climate is so abreviated that it makes the mini-series seem somewhat absurd. There was no mention of CHOAM. Maybe if they had 12 hours they could have done better.
Even with the frustrations, I enjoyed watching the series.",976060800,,585,4.4766355140186915
1391544,5,B000053V8F,"I was glued to the Sci-Fi channel for 3 straight nights in glorious satisfaction.  A much better adaption than David Lynch's good attempt, and wildly entertaining.  I can't understand why this cult of Herbert followers must insist on a complete page for page adaption.  Listen up, its not pratically possible!  Be thankful that one this rich and faithful was even possible!  Most viewers won't sit down for, 'what would be asked for from the cultists', a 20 hour adaption, and most production companies won't spend 500-600 million dollars.  So for the so called called Dune experts, get a life, and get off your high horse and take this for what it is; an incredible, complex, and  richly satisfying story.  The SFX are awesome, the acting was great, and the story is riviting.  Trust me, buy this; you will want it for your video collection.",976060800,14,842,4.791666666666667

Very well done TV series and it's gotten many awards to show that.
The special thing is how the entire culture revolves around the Spice. Weird things are people fighting with knives, when they have guns to use instead? Another thing that is completely different and fresh is they use the mental power of the Navigators to move unpropelled ships across the galaxy through worm holes. Actually much more plausible than rockets traveling faster than light.
Definitely has a 1960s vintage show by the obsession with mental powers enhanced by ingesting the Spice.",1515801600,2,688,4.838983050847458
