2298847,4,B0009KNR42,"...hinders the otherwise pretty excellent coverage. I bought this one after purchasing The First World War, based on Hew Strachan's book,  and much prefer that one because of the seeming freshness of the material and the superb narration by Jonathan Lewis who also wrote, produced and directed the project. The narrative here by Robert Ryan (Hollywood Actor)  is not nearly as good, is hard to stay interested in (after hearing Lewis) and, as another reviewer mentioned, seems dated. I found it to be performed in almost a monotone, whereas Lewis' narrative in The First World War is full of emotion and inflection. Don't know if this helps but to me, that seems to be the primary difference. Overall, I just found The First World War to be more interesting but again, this series is no slacker, either.",1191801600,14,803,4.854014598540146
2298848,4,B0009KNR42,"...but nevertheless, great and abundant footage. Just for that it's worth the buy.

2298849,5,B0009KNR42,"This DVD comes in a three-volume set.  It is narrated by Robert Ryan whose voice sets the tone for this truly monumental telling of an event that is still being felt by the world amost 100 years later.

It is non-political, it does not take sides, what it does is show with clarity and feeling the effect war had on the entire world. The social, economic, and political realities of the day are explained.  I have a minor in history and I was impressed with the research and scholarly approach taken by the film makers in this epic documentary.

There are over 70 episodes within the three volume set.  Everyone who watches will gain an appreciation for how WWI changed the geo-political landscape forever.  After watching this series, you will be able to understand in depth what Lawrence of Arbia meant to the Arabs.

This DVD is worth 2x the price.",1178496000,28,851,4.596026490066225

2298852,5,B0009KNR42,"Excellent documentary series produced by CBS News in the early sixties and superbly narrrated by the late Robert Ryan, still has an edge over the many others that were produced recently.  Lots and lots of photographic and film footage, especially of the German invasion of neutral Belgium, the air and sea war, the sinking of the Lusitania, but sadly lacking in many other series.  This series, some will call dated, yet remains remarkably comprehensive and engaging and well worth purchasing. If you like your history in large doses and complete like, for example, Will Durant's 11 volume comprehensive opus, The History of Civilization, then you will enjoy this three disc set.  This set is available at Costco for about $19.95, where I purchased mine, rather than the $30.00 list price Amazon charges here.",1149379200,65,809,5.067669172932331
2298853,4,B0009KNR42,"Not much to add to Rehovot's excellent review except for one nit pick: the series focuses too much on the USA.  America's involvement in the Great War does not warrant 5 episodes out of 26.  (Just as The World at War, the outstanding Thames series on the second world war, is weighted too heavily on Britain.)  That said, this is a wonderful series.  Certainly worth the time and money if you want to learn the basics of WWI.  Watched it as a kid - enjoyed seeing it again.",1122768000,24,473,4.329545454545454
2298854,5,B0009KNR42,"In anticipation of the 50th anniversary of the onset of World War I in 1964, both the BBC in Britain and CBS in the United States produced epid documentary series on the history of the war (The Beeb's is called ""The Great War"").  Both are now available on DVD and I would have to say that someone who has a strong interest in the war and is interested in its visual images would find both series of interest.  Besides the fact that naturally each tends to focus more on the war effort of the country that produced the series, there are other significant differences that make the two series complement each other.  First of all, the CBS programs were made to fit into a half-hour time slot, so taking into consideration the commercials, each program is about 24 minutes long, whereas the BBC programs are over 40 minutes.  In addition, the British series focuses almost exclusively on the military aspects of the war in addition to social and economic conditions in Britain.  The BBC series added interviews with people who participated in the war, whereas the Americans relied only on archive films.  The CBS series places less emphasis on the military course of the war but expands on the political and social forces that led up to the war and affected its conduct.  Whereas ""The Great War"" simply mentions in passing the demoralization that occurred on the German home front that brought about Ludendorff's demands for an an armisitice, the CBS series devotes an entire program to what was happening inside Germany as the war progressed.  A particularly interesting difference is that the CBS series devoted a significant amount of time to a detailed description of the Battle of Jutland in which the main battle fleets of Germany and Britain faced each other, whereas the BBC show just mentions it in passing (my theory is that since the battle was a tactical draw the British were not to interested in talking too much about it!)  Finally, ""The Great War"" ends with the armisitice of 11 November 1918 showing deliriously happy crowds, whereas the American series devotes significant time showing how the indecisive end of the war and the subsequent Treaty of Versailles paved the way for the next, even more destructive war.

One drawback of the CBS film is that little explanation is given to the conduct of operations on the Eastern Front which ""The Great War"" discusses at length, possibly because in the 1960's there was a tendency to dismiss Russian history due to Cold War tensions.

I again strongly recommend both series to the viewer who really wants a comprehensive view of this war that radically altered the world in ways that are still being felt.",1118188800,300,2665,4.796943231441048

2298893,5,B0009KNR42,"On the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I, you cannot get a better overview of ""The Great War"" than this CBS News series from 1964 (produced for the 50th anniversary). Everyone knows of the First World War but few people know much about it outside of movies like ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT and GALLIPOLI which focus on battles. But there was so much more to WWI than just its confrontations. It literally shaped life in the 20th century and made World War II not only possible but an inevitability. What makes this series so invaluable is that it looks at the social and political aspects that led up to the conflict and the social and political repercussions that came about as a result of it. Originally conceived as 22 half hour episodes (24 minutes actually with room for commercials) which were broadcast on CBS back in 1964 (I remember watching it at home as a 12 year old), it was later shown on cable TV back in 1988. It was then issued as a 5 volume VHS set in 1994. Now it's available as 3 DVD set for around $20.

Although the presentation is somewhat dated by today's standards (the silent period footage has not been speed corrected so it runs a little fast), the condition of the films shown is remarkable. You'll see everything from battles to the havoc wreaked on civilians in the cities under siege as well as the personal observations of those involved. There are also political cartoons and examples of how propaganda fueled and prolonged the conflict. World War I truly was a blueprint for World War II and for every war that has occurred since then including those that are currently underway in the Middle East and in Ukraine today. The original music by American composer Morton Gould is powerful while actor Robert Ryan's narration is effective without being pedantic. If you want real background depth, read Barbara Tuchman's remarkable THE GUNS OF AUGUST. For a different spin try any of the series that followed but for an effective presentation of every aspect of the most far reaching war in history, this series is hard to beat.",1417219200,3,2073,4.633152173913044

point of fact, th beginnings were very much the work of a few scheming mid-level
govt officials, not the Kaiser and others, who mostly can be blamed for being
rather stupid rather than evil. But  I always considered Morton Gould's

NARRATION BY ROBERT RYAN MAKES THIS SERIES A CUT ABOVE MANY OTHERS I HAVE SEEN.  LORD!  DID THE MAN KNOW HOW TO READ A SCRIPT LINE.  AT FIFTY THIS IS STILL A MAJOR DOCUMENTARY OF THE PERIOD, AND IT COVERS THE HISTORY SO WELL I USE IT IN MY AMERICAN HISTORY CLASS.",1392681600,,490,4.282608695652174
2298935,3,B0009KNR42,"As noted by other reviewers, this documentary was aired within the CBS prime time line up during the 1964-65 television season.  Each episode is about 20-25 minutes long.  It is perhaps because of this format (and intended audience) that the series tends to be heavy on visuals, but lacks in-depth analysis of the events themselves.

I would highly recommend for anyone who is interested in WWI footage; it continued to surprise me throughout that so much film survived from the battles that began in 1914.  The footage prior to the US involvement was the most startling, possibly due to the censorship of all media that US demanded to maintain public support once we joined.  Still, the images are remarkably well preserved (albeit often ""jerky"", due to the infancy of the motion picture technology, but that is to be expected.)  One really wonders about the photojournalists embedded with the troops; their vantage point is literally in the trenches.

CBS must have decided that a picture is truly worth a thousand words, because there are no eyewitness accounts or historical analysis, save for a few quotes read by the narrator and a final episode that touches on, at a high level, the seeds planted for WWII.  The narration, completely by Robert Ryan, is a little dated (most noticeable in the descriptions of women and Bolsheviks), but is solid.  As common with mid-century documentaries, it takes on a ""news reel"" feel, although the writers obviously made decent attempts at objectivity.  What was distracting, at least in my opinion, was the volume of the music throughout each episode.  Very early on, one realizes why the only credits are given to Ryan and Morton Gould.  Gould wrote the repetitive score, and the CBS Orchestra is prominently heard throughout, using crashing crescendos to denote drama and light-hearted woodwinds when the action on screen is not so grave.  Completely unnecessary and annoying at times.

Having studied WWII since childhood, my goal in purchasing this series was to get a better understanding of the antecedents of the Great War, and I believe it has definitely helped, although not in a vacuum.  Because it is from a US perspective, it does spend some time on the Doughboys, even though the US involvement was slight, compared to the European experience.  The events surrounding the Habsburg and Ottoman empires are almost footnotes, which was unfortunate and begat a lot of questions while viewing this.  I marathoned this series with a friend, and I was in charge of the DVD player pause button, while he researched the topic at hand on the internet.  This pattern repeated itself 3-4 times per episode, in an attempt to get some context on what was just presented.  This method worked, although not the most enjoyable scenario (having to often rely on Wikipedia and posted academic papers as Cliff's Notes.)

Overall, definitely worth the price on Amazon, just don't expect to be an expert by the final episode.",1392595200,7,2959,4.987780040733197

...I saw this many years ago on television and was blown away.  I had it on tape and need to get it on DVD.  I have seen many other documentaries on WWI in its entirety... and this one tops them all.
.
... A great start was having Robert Ryan as the narrator. Unlike some narrators, he was not simply around to pick up his paycheck.  He puts his memorable voice and very real talent into this work.
.
...Many documentaries are lifeless... if they have a musical score, it is usually forgettable... not so here.  Others lack a sense of ""energy""... as if bored with their subject... not so here.
.
...There are many fine reviews here, but I want to cover two specific points.  First, they have really ""cleaned up"" much of the footage... to the point where one is contemplating calling the ""Time Travel Police...""  And in wrapping up the close of the war... the appearance of people that we would hear from again... David Ben Gurion and Ho Chi Minh...
.
...My only quibble is that I miss the original opening used in the TV presentation of the French sniper in slow motion rising to the edge of the trench.

2298954,5,B0009KNR42,"I have always had interest in WWII since I was little as my Grandfather served in Italy.  I knew very little about the first war and decided to buy this DVD as it was the first DVD that came up on Amazon when I did a search and figured...what the hell?

The first thing that I noticed was that the narration was done by Robert Ryan.  I remembered his name from ""The Dirty Dozen"".  You'll remember him as Colonel Breed.  They guy that Lee Marvin does not get along with.  The same guy that Donald Sutherland fools into thinking that he's a general.  That's him.

At first, Robert Ryan's narration was odd as I was not used to the way he narrates...probably due to the way people spoke in the 60's, if that makes sense.  I would go so far to say that I did not care for this series at first, but that went away very quickly.  And now, I actually like this series because of the way he did the job.  You can really tell based on his tone exactly what he means.  He does an outstanding job.

The music score was done by Morton Gould.  I know that you've probably read reviews about how the music does not fit to the film.  And that's it's too loud or whatever.  All I can say is, ignore what you've read.  Once you start watching, you will realize that whoever put the music to the film did an amazing job.  The music and film fit together perfectly.

Sure, there are no battle sounds.  People complain about that.  Big deal.  There was not audio in films back then.  I do not care to hear fake sounds dubbed in.  If you want that, there are many other WWI documentaries that you can watch that have this embedded into the film.

I have watched this whole series many times.  I watch an episode, usually every 2-3 days.  Why?  You can miss so much information. Every time you watch an episode, you learn more about times, dates, events, people involved etc.  I know that they left out information, but I feel that they did a good enough job considering when it was made.

Here's who should buy this:

If you know nothing about WWI and want to learn about history at the turn of the century...what caused it, who was involved, how senseless it was, and how 90% of the world was involved in this terrible tragedy.  And especially how this war directly lead to WWII.  You'll learn that many of the key men in WWII came from WWI.  You'll see that Eisenhower, FDR, Hitler, Lawrence of Arabia, Douglas Macarthur, Hermann Goering, Omar Bradley, Gregory Rasputin, Pancho Villa just to name a few were directly involved in this war.

If you want to see how the airplane started as a novelty only to become a full on war machine in just 4 years.  How the aircraft carrier came to be.  This was also a time when submarines came about and the flamethrower came into action.  In a nutshell, many things stemmed from this war that are present today, that no one really knows about.

If you like well put together documentaries, this is a must buy.

This is no joke.  Total seriousness here.  No one is paying me anything to say this.  If someone put me on a desert island and said that I could take ONE and one only, DVD or Blu Ray series, it would be this right here.  Never before have I been pulled so hard into a documentary such as this.  And I love United States War Documentaries.  If Robert Ryan and Morton Gould were not involved in the making of this series, my opinion would be different I'm sure.

One of the scenes by Robert Ryan still stays with me to this day in the 3rd DVD...this was when everyone was waiting for the war to end...and the happiness you can see on the faces of those still alive that it's over for them, and to see enemies hanging out, smoking cigarettes and trading things after the wars end.

Here's where it starts...

An American correspondent has been waiting to see what would happen at 11 'o clock.

""Nothing Happened"", he writes.  ""The war just ended.""

There is nothing to separate enemies now except Foch's stern orders:

""NO FRATERNIZATION.  IF AN ENEMY COMES ACROSS YOUR LINES, SHOOT HIM"".

The order is widely ignored.",1374796800,3,4046,4.365591397849462

Having bought quite a few DVDs on WW1, I thought there wasn't much I hadn't seen, but this documentary produced in 1964 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the War to end all wars showed lots of footage not used in documentaries since.
There are some fascinating scenes of the rulers of Europe before and during the conflict, of battle scenes not seen on other documentaries and ultimately the wonderful narration by Robert Ryan.
This documentary, World War One in colour and some parts of the BBC documentary, The Great War, I would watch over and over again. Quite simply this documentary is fascinating and ultimately brilliant.
The 100th anniversary of the beginning of World War One is in 2014. I hope that some far sighted producer creates as good a piece of film-making as The Complete Story:World War I. The assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, a relatively minor piece of news in June 1914 caused the whole world to change forever, and caused another World War 20 years later.

2298975,4,B0009KNR42,"This is a worthy companion to the BBC's Great War series which was produced at the same time (1964).  A very well made documentary which has a lot of footage not usually seen in UK produced documentaries.  This footage is treated with more respect than we are sometimes used to and although it is (as usual) cut up to illustrate a point, we are occasionally treated to longer examples of particular films with explanations of their production.  The Mediterranean U-Boat cruise footage is a good case in point.  How many times have we seen this footage in bits and pieces to illustrate a section of documentary narrative about ship sinkings which may relate to any ocean and indeed either the First or Second World War?  Here we get an idea of the original film and how it was made.

It was produced for a US audience and concentrates on that country's involvement in the war and this is understandable.  However, that said, except for Gallipoli and the Lusitania it is as if 1915 never happened.  No Western Front at all for that period.  Also, as it was produced so long ago and because US attitudes to Europeans and their wars have always been circumspect, it is hard not to detect a certain feeling of American superiority in the narrative.  Those stupid Europeans having to be saved by the brave doughboys.  Although, to be fair, it does point out US deficiencies, particularly their tardy deployment, the inexperience of the troops and supply problems at home and at the front.

Overall though, an excellent investment for anyone wanting a good documentary on the First World War.",1352160000,,1585,4.744525547445256
2298976,5,B0009KNR42,"After almost 50 years, this 1964 documentary series is still the best available American documentary on World War 1.  I recall watching it on PBS in the mid 1970's and had been trying to find it for years.  There have been several documentaries on the war in the past 15 years or so, but none that I have seen were so comprehensive.  Newer documentaries use a lot of re-enactments, but this one uses orginal footage throughout.  I had not known that so much film existed from World War One.

I think for me, the mood of the series is what makes it so special, Robert Ryan's narration always seems to contain a hint of melancholy and the footage used really brings home the truth about what a disaster this war was for the entire world, but especially for European society - an entire culture was destroyed and replaced, and you really get the sense from this documentary about how apocolyptic the war was for its participants.

My only complaint is that each epiose cuts out the opening and ending credits - usually I wouldn't be upset over this, but I recall how powerful the credits were, as they were superimposed on a film clip of a soldier rising up out of a trench and aiming his rifle at the enemy, then freeze framed.

2298978,4,B0009KNR42,"After watching British television's Channel Four series ""The First World War"", it's refreshing to see CBS TV's ""The Complete Story: World War I"".  While some might feel that America's involvement in the First World War doesn't deserve five episodes in this CBS TV version, the British series DOESN'T EVEN MENTION America's involvement until near the end of the series. The British series even chastises the Americans because they were unwilling to submit to local Allied commanders and ballyhooed the tactics used by the Americans.  I don't even recall seeing one battle showing American fighting men at work in the British version.  After some of the comments made in the British series, one is left with the impression that Americans only looked good in their uniform but were tactically inept.  Granted, America entered the fray years after it started but some of us had grandfathers who fought and died in places like Bellleau Wood, Chateau-Thierry, and Bouresches.  At least the French appreciated American  Marines' involvement by awarding them the French Croix De Guerre.  And the Germans certainly noticed American Marines involvement by rewarding them with a new title, ""Devil Dog.""
Narrator Robert Ryan lends credence to this CBS TV documentary by virtue of the fact that he served his time in the Marines and was a boxing champion and drill instructor.
The glaring absence of America's involvement in the British version isn't the only difference between the two World War 1 documentaries.  This CBS version provides lots of historical clips, vivid descriptions, and moves at a faster pace with details about various battles.  It's almost a different view, a different perspective of World War 1.
Hats off to the people who made this CBS TV version available.  It's regrettable that the producers of the British version weren't as objective and unbiased as the producers of the great WWII British series, ""World At War.""",1341360000,,1931,5.160256410256411

These discs have some of the rarest footage I have seen including live scenes of MacArthur, FDR, George Marshall, Harry Truman etc.
It is especially strong on the Eastern Front 1914 - 1918, The Russian Revolution,
The Italian Campaigns, The Western Front ,the Ottoman Empire and the rise of the Young Turks, The Hapsburgs, the Archduke,Germany, Air Power, Sea Power and Land Power.

It is exceptionally strong on America and its involvement "" Over Here "" and "" Over There "". For example it covers the early 1900 punitive expeditions into Mexico by Pershing: "" ... a young officer on his staff favors the tactics of a Western Gunfighter - his name is George S. Patton - Pershing nicknames him ' The Bandit ' .
It is weak on the African Front, the Commonwealth.

Most enjoyable for me was 45 minutes of
 "" The Songs of World war I - Tipperary and all that Jazz""

Watching it again now 35 years later it holds up very well. Robert Ryan doesn't put a whole lot of emotion into it at the beginning but his subtlety works as by the time you get to Verdun you can tell his voice is very cynical as he's reading the death figures and gains made. I only just completed disc one and it took me a couple of months of casual but regular viewing so it is an excellent value for the money. I learned in watching just the first disc about Herbert Hoover being the head of Belgium Relief and that the Germans had a cargo U boat that successfully made it through the blockade to America. Both things were never mentioned in the much newer World War One BBC set [...] I guess to write a review that would help other buyers here, I would like to say that I really enjoyed the newer set and watched it almost straight through, but if you were looking for the best set, I vote for this one. It's got a lot more content to it, plus since it is an American production and was done by CBS news during the 60's (Walter was the head newscaster then, very prestigious outfit at that time), it takes a look at both sides more then the British series does. The newer set is more accessible to the everyday viewer (color and better graphics) but if your really into History this set is superior.

Also, it takes into account the early surrender of Russia and the rise of Lenin's Soviet Union.  To sum up, it offers a great panoramic view of the conflict.

8062701,5,B0009KNR42,"World War I:  The Complete Story (2005, three discs) consists of 26 23-minute episodes, featuring contemporary still and motion pictures and maps, with narrative read by Robert Ryan, and music written by Morton Gould.

Of course, this documentary is not a complete history of the First World War.  But it would be difficult to provide a more complete account of the war in such a 10-hour series.  This documentary covers political and diplomatic developments, military strategies (e.g., the Schlieffen Plan, Plan 17), the major fronts (Western Front, Eastern Front, Middle East) and major battles (Tannenberg, Liege, Antwerp, Marne, Verdun, Somme, Gallipoli, Caporetto, the 1918 German offensive, Soissons, Amiens, and Argonne).  It also describes the war at sea.  Among the few things not covered are the seizure of German colonies in the Pacific, and battles in German African colonies.  The film discusses such new weapons and tactics as submarines, machine guns, observation balloons, aircraft, trench warfare, poison gas, flamethrowers, and tanks.  It reveals the lives of soldiersin combat, training, daily life at the front, and medical treatment.  And it does not neglect life on the home frontsBritish, German, Russian, Americandealing with such matters as morale, propaganda, food shortages, rationing, changing roles for women and African Americans, the Irish Easter Uprising, American pursuit of Villa in Mexico, the Russian Revolution, and postwar unrest in several European countries.  The film describes the Armistice, the Versailles Conference, allied occupation of parts of Germany, allied intervention in Russia after the war, the world wide Influenza epidemic, and the contemporary music of Britain, France, and the U.S.

The Versailles treaty stipulated that Germany was responsible for the war.  Since then, historians have disagreed regarding the question of war guilt.  But this documentary places the blame squarely on Austria-Hungaryminimizing the significance of the Serbian secret services possible involvement in the assassination of Franz Ferdinand.  Because of suspected Serbian complicity in this crime, European leaders anticipated a strong response from Austria, but they did not expect war.  A decade of diplomatic crises had preceded the war, but there had been no major European war for a century.  1914 seemed to be just another crisis.  After a while, news about the assassination dropped out of the headlines.  The entangling web of alliances meant that small conflicts could escalate into a major war; but the initial military measures (e.g., partial mobilization) were largely diplomatic movesto enable countries to negotiate from strength.  Unfortunately, the prompt action mandated by military strategy precluded the diplomacy that might have resolved the crisis.  Each nation thought it was acting in self-defense; each expected a short war in which it would be victorious.  Both diplomats and generals were in over their heads.

Some comments in this documentary seem to reflect a bias against Germany.  After quoting the Kaisers comment, God has called us to civilize the world.  We are missionaries of human progress, the script concludes, For those who are listening, the words are ominous indeed.  Of course, similar invocations of the white mans burden had come from other countries.  Although it admits that most atrocity stories were pure fabrication, the film portrays the German invasion of Belgium as an atrocity, and concludes that, A new image has been stamped on the worlds consciencean image that Germany will not live down, and that, in a later generation, Germany will live up to.  This suggests that German motives and conduct in World War I were essentially the same as in World War II.  Unfortunately, subsequent history has demonstrated that Germany was not the only nation willing to take military action against neutral nations, killing civilians and destroying cultural treasures in the name of ""military necessity.""

World War I was the last war to be welcomed by cheering crowds.  It witnessed the end of old Europe and the downfall of several dynasties.  It was followed by disillusionment and social unrest.  There were disagreements among the allies.  The peace terms did not end national rivalries or permanently resolve territorial questions.  The series concludes that the confidence that once held the world togethera faith in the plans of reasonable men was lost.

By the early 20th century, motion pictures had become a widespread form of entertainment.  And hand-cranked motion picture cameras had been present to record the Italian expedition to K-2, the worlds second highest mountain, in 1909, and Scotts Antarctic expedition in 1912.  Cameramen also captured many events of the World War I era on film, but the quality of the resulting images, all black and white, reflects the limitations of the equipment with which they worked.  Viewers are warned that, although State of the art technology has been used to present the highest quality production . . . , some imperfections in image . . . are unavoidable.  CBS did a good job of researching and editing film footage, and combining it with a dramatic narrative and an appropriate musical score.  Although originally aired on CBS in 1964-65, to mark the 50th anniversary of the First World War, this documentary has aged well.  It was re-released by CBS in 1995.  This version, released on DVD in 2005, includes several brief extras on various subjects:  the death of King Edward, VII, the conquest of South Pole, the loss of the Titanic, construction of the Panama Canal, the roles of selected U.S. military officers (Arnold, Bradley, Eisenhower, MacArthur, Marshall, and Nimitz) during these years, Prohibition, Womens suffrage, the Irish Free State, and the rise of Fascists to power in Italy.  Another DVD version of this series was released in 2014 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWI-The-Complete-Story-100th-Memorial-Edition/dp/B00HRUQ9QK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWI: The Complete Story - 100th Memorial Edition</a>), supplemented by a fourth disc dealing with subsequent U.S. wars (WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq-Desert Storm).",1496188800,,6208,5.516913319238901
