1894584,4,B00009WVLG,While the movie is cute I don't think its one of their best. I love the girls so I'm glad I have it.,1402876800,,100,3.391304347826087
1894585,4,B00009WVLG,"My kids love Full House, And she saw this as we were  looking for more of there books on the internet, She begged for this DVD And I bought it for her as a surprise,",1377648000,,165,3.7142857142857144
1894586,5,B00009WVLG,I never see this before and  i watch it. it totally different. It half music and movie. when they was teenagers and their voices are different when they sing it.,1361664000,,161,4.366666666666666
1894587,5,B00009WVLG,"This is one of my favorite Mary-Kate and Ashley DVDs.  I bought one of the last copies of this disc in the bargain bins at my local Wal-Mart. I like the ""Noise about Boys"" and ""Saturday Night"" songs the best.  The twins are so cute in this.",1158451200,,240,4.085106382978723
1894588,1,B00009WVLG,"Im sorry, but the videos in which they were 4-10 years old were Um, but this is pathetic. At least it is one of thier last creepy videos. THIS IS SO FAKE. I mean who's life is like this, Nobodys. And their is one dumb backstabbing freind who is uglier than Mary-Kate's bush hairdo (AND TRUST ME, IT'S UGLY).",1120521600,,307,4.220338983050848
1894589,5,B00009WVLG,"These girls are so cute! They should be rock stars! I mean, they have awesome voices and they have the look. This movie is great. It shows you a deeper acting style that the twinnys have NEVER shown before! The songs are emotional and fun at the same time, and the dancing has never been better. Its a must see!",1111449600,,311,4.2
1894590,5,B00009WVLG,"OK, first of all: I can't belive the people who says that they can't sing:S They are SO good! I LOVE The Noise About Boys, and also the other songs. This DVD also contains Our Music Video, which was first released on VHS. Our Music Video is a lot of fun and so are School Dance Party. It's really fun to watch it! :) Just buy it if you like the Olsens, if you're a fan! :) It's really good! Well, I think that if you're a fan, you can't miss anything they've done!

MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY ROCKS!!",1104105600,,494,4.040816326530612
1894591,5,B00009WVLG,"This is a very great movie and I really love it. When I saw it for the first time I was not able to remove it from the DVD player anymore. Mary-Kate and Ashley look so cute in there and the wardrobe is very nice too, especially in the end where they wear a black dress. And their four songs are very good as well. I can't understand people saying that Mary-Kate and Ashley would not be able to sing. I love these four songs, especially ""Noyz about Boys"". It's a pity that the movie is only 26 minutes long, but it is great anyway and I can't stop watching it. So I think that this is a must-have DVD for every MKAA fan and also for every non-MKAA fan.",1097366400,,651,4.015384615384615
1894592,4,B00009WVLG,i got this a long time a go and i liked it i did not love it but i liked it i am a big fan of mary-kate and ashely and i can tell they are never goinig to be singers  i likeed this movie you suold get it but it is not the best,1036886400,,226,3.109090909090909
1894593,5,B00009WVLG,"This video is my favorite from the You're invited series because it is way more realistic.  It is also great for fans who are a little older such as 13 14 or 15 years old.  mka WERE 14 when they made it!  Now this videos shows content for fans the same age as the girls.  Get this video if you are in your low teens, because you will really be able to relate.",1024704000,,359,3.8767123287671232
1894594,5,B00009WVLG,This is no ordinary Your Invited series. This time Mary-Kate and Ashley are much older and sing and dress more mature. Ashley is wondering whether she will make it Queen for her school dance while Mary-Kate is stuggling to ask a guy she likes to go to the dance with her.,1003363200,,271,4.333333333333333
1894595,4,B00009WVLG,This video I did like a lot better than their other sing along videos. I actually thought the songs were not bad but they were not the best. They were o.k. This video is better for teens. They are a lot more grown up. It is their last Your Invited video but they as usual will still sell a lot.,997228800,,294,3.9166666666666665
1894596,3,B00009WVLG,"Ok, the video starts out cind of strange! The girls are totaly lip singing. Not only do they have bad singing but they have about 1,000 back-up singers! On the song Monday Morning I couldn't hear the Olsens at all! I liked the clothing. My favourite song is What's All The Noise Aboute Boys(because Mary-Kate and Ashley dance in it).",994032000,,333,4.566666666666666
1894597,5,B00009WVLG,"I thought The School Dance Party was a great movie. The dancewas cool and it is just like my dances at school. If u wonderingwhether to buy this or not I think you should. Its great for all ages, even teenagers. Mary-Kate and Ashley Rule! :-) END",964137600,,246,4.25531914893617
1894598,5,B00009WVLG,"I am a big-time oLSEN FAN! So, obviuously i like the video, i think it is their best You're Invited Video. But it is kinda sad that it is the last one in the series. But it is also kinda good, cause they said that now they  are gonna focus more on bigger projects like Feature length movies. I  really liked the video. But, it is much different from the other party  videos. Alot more grown up i think. And, the songs are MUCH better than  ones in the past. And everyone has to admit, MK+A are awesome actresses,  but they are not awesome singers. But, they do pretty well. Don't ya think.  Well, i luved the video!  -Lindsay",963273600,,625,4.201680672268908

7993729,5,B00009WVLG,"The twins have always stayed positive and have role models for the most part. I really enjoyed this movie; and a big story to me, portrays one of the girls not waiting for the guy to call her, or ask her out; but to take control of the situation as diplomatic as possible. I will always love these movies!!",1494806400,,306,4.203389830508475
