8402312,4,B003QHWG3I,"My gracious, we just don't grow our leaders like this anymore. The reason that I gave this only four stars is that I wished there was more to view on this dvd about this great American Hero. Puller McArthur, Patton, Eisenhower and Nimitz et al. Chesty, was more than just a Marine, he was an American Badass who fought in Central America, WWI and after that the Korean War. Chesty even volunteered for Vietnam but his blunt honesty ended his career despite the fact that President Kennedy asked that he continue in service. I also suggest reading the autobiography of his only son, who served in Vietnam and suffered traumatic injuries from a mind explosion. That book is called Fortunate Son. Sadly, Chesty son' descended into a nightmare of depression and alcoholism that eventually made him take his own life. While at OCS in the late 1970's, we never turned in without yelling, ""Good Night Chesty Puller, Wherever You Are At."" Rest In Peace General.",1352678400,5,953,4.781818181818182

8402314,4,B003QHWG3I,"This is a pretty good addition to the information available about Lewis Burwell Puller, the beloved, legendary Chesty of The United States Marine Corps. While not terribly ""deep"" -- it is, after all, a one-hour TV show -- it does give some insight into the man behind the myth.

For more detailed background, DO NOT rely on the Burke Davis book (written in conjunction with Chesty, and, therefore, suspect in slant and detail). Instead, rely on Colonel Jon T. Hoffman's ""Chesty"", a well-written, impartial examination of the life of this extraordinary man.",1290124800,6,556,5.043478260869565
