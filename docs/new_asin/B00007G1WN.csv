1809357,3,B00007G1WN,"The only way I can describe this story satisfactorily is to call it ""Sherlock Holmes on acid"". Sherlock is having nightmares that are actually premonitions of his next case. It's time to hang up the deerstalker when we see Holmes having psychic visions and running about the street in his nightgown. It's not only Sherlock Holmes who's having a bad day here...it's a great looking production, but the storyline and direction ensure that that the audience is just as confused as the Great Detective.
As far as the two lead performances go, Jeremy Brett is in very bad shape here. He was unfortunately extremely ill in the last few years of his life as he was battling heart problems and manic depression. In this story, we can see the effects the damaging drugs he was prescribed were having on him...he is bloated, his movements are sluggish, and he has trouble getting through his lines without wheezing. It's a tribute to Brett that he was still able to continue as Holmes at this stage of his life, but it's hard to enjoy this story (and the follow up series, The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes) seeing this once vibrant actor at such a low ebb.
Edward Hardwicke is in good form as Watson here. Since his introduction in The Empty House from The Return Of Sherlock Holmes (also available from Amazon on a single DVD and in the series box set), Hardwicke proved himself to be the one dependable and consistent element of the Granada Holmes series right through to its end. Changes in production staff, budgets, and Brett's health problems all impacted sometimes negatively on the series...but Hardwicke could always be counted on to give a great performance. He was really the backbone of the Granada series throughout most of its run and he deserves a great deal more credit than he usually recieves.
I view this story more as an interesting curio than a serious addition to the screen adventures of Sherlock Holmes as produced by Granada. It's unfortunate that the series didn't end with The Master Blackmailer as everything that followed was mostly mediocre, and as tired and out of sorts as its star.",1067731200,9,2102,4.761643835616439
1809358,3,B00007G1WN,"Having gone through almost the entire Brett series, I was initialy quite impressed by The Eligible Bachelor. But over the years, it has somewhat diminished in stature. It's still a good full-length movie, but by no means, near as excellent as Sign of Four or The Master Blackmailer.

Again, part of the reason was Brett was visibly ill throughout the filming and he has visible weight gains. It was not his best performance, but he still managed to hold it together, as compared to some of his very last performances on the Memoirs.

Still, it is far better than the Last Vampyre and the mediocre Hound of the Baskervilles, and that is largely due to Peter Hammond's cinematic style, somewhat similar to The Master Blackmailer. Lots of dark lighting and snappy cuts and reflective shots.

It is from this point, that the series took a turn for downwards, but it is still entertaining, but not as rewatchable as some of the best from the series.",1055030400,,944,4.709090909090909
1809359,5,B00007G1WN,"This adaptation extends far beyond the boundaries of the story it is based on, The Noble Bachelor. It does so brilliantly, serving as a fascinating character study of Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett), as well as a  hallucinatory gothic mystery-drama. Holmes actually ventures off from his  religion of rational thinking, to sketch his bizarre dreams.  Simultaneously, the background of Lord Robert (the eligible bachelor),  Hetty, Maude, Helena and Flora unfolds. This film is a feast for the  senses. Miasmic fog swirls throughout the dirty London streets, drunkards  laugh madly with an overlay of dreamy music. Holmes and Watson must cut  through the vices of the underbelly of Victorian society in order to find  the missing Hetty, release Flora Miller, and expose the evil deeds of the  eligible bachelor. Revenge finally reconciles the atrocities, and Holmes  discovers the prophetic nature of his dreams. Devotees of Sherlock Holmes  and gothic period works will love this film!",945907200,16,983,5.359477124183006

1809432,3,B00007G1WN,"If looking at some of the other reviews, you might hesitate to make a purchase. While this is certainly one of the most bizarre of the Brett adventures as Holmes, it does have some redeeming qualities and not quite as horrible as some would allow you to believe.

Perhaps the biggest crime this feature makes is the shameless amount of padding they added to the plot to make the original Conan Doyle short story stretch to meet it's 90 minute mark; indeed, I feel it would have been better served by tighter editing and a shorter run time. Then again, one would be justified in giving this adventure failing marks as so much of the original story is either lost or altered. Holmes purists take note: although it may say 'The Eligible Bachelor' it bares only a passing resemblance to the original story as was written.

On the positive side, what you have is yet another fine outing of Jeremy Brett's portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in a setting that is quite unlike anything he's ever been in before. Prophetic nightmares, veiled ladies who walk the night, a cackling crone, and a gothic mansion that houses sinister secrets give this production a pronounced horror influence; this would be a great treat for a Sherlock Holmes fan to watch around Halloween time.

Overall, if you're a diehard fan of Sherlock Holmes (especially if you enjoy the way he's played by Jeremy Brett), then by all means go ahead and add this to your collection. Just be mindful that it's nowhere near the quality of the episodes from 'The Adventures of' or 'The Return of' and not indicative of the series as a whole.",1396569600,2,1591,4.654804270462633

1809434,2,B00007G1WN,"I actually gave this one more star than I planned just out of respect for the years of great series based on the Doyle novels. I can not imagine how this movie got the green light to production as it has absolutely nothing to do with the original story.

I found it to be intensely confusing, and for the first half of the movie I had no idea who the characters were or what was going on. I found Holme's ""telepathy"" or ""empathy"" to be a complete and utter break in the fourth wall, to which I remember Holmes saying many times ""Eliminate the impossible, and what remains, no matter how improbable, must be the truth"". Holmes scoffed at science-fiction and fantasy and trusted only in powers of deduction. To suddenly make him have an episode of ""telepathic"" revelation betrays everything that Holmes stands for.

I really can't recommend this one, even if you are a lover of the series. Very sad but there you have it.",1388361600,3,919,4.497005988023952
1809435,3,B00007G1WN,"I've only recently begun watching Sherlock Holmes, so I'm no expert on the ""accuracy"" of the characters/plot. That being said, I enjoyed it enough to give it 4 stars. It was a little slow in the beginning (not boring), there was too much focus on his dreams I thought, and he didn't seem to be a main character, at least like in the episodes I've seen. I might watch it one more time, it was just a little dark for me. Very pleased with the ending though.

Christian warning: God's Name is used in vain once that I recall, and there's a scene where there's cleavage exposed, but it doesn't last long, just so you know.",1384041600,,618,4.327586206896552

1809438,5,B00007G1WN,"I had never seen this Sherlock movie, and it definately met my expectations. I would recommend this film to all Sherlock Holmes fans.",1346544000,,133,4.826086956521739
1809439,3,B00007G1WN,"As someone who's read all the Holmes stories several times, I certainly understand that there are expectations amongst fans, a number of whom want (A)their Holmes as close to the written tales as possible and (B) their 'Granada' Holmes as classically ""Brett"" as possible.  Well, this episode is neither overly close to the written tale nor Brett in his classical form.  If that's going to bother you, then this  film will likely disappoint.

But, as others have pointed out, there are other ways in which to view this take on ""The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor"".  I was in a flexible mood when I first saw this program, happily surprised to discover an episode of Brett's I hadn't yet seen, and allowed myself to enjoy it very much.  Just as Conan Doyle sometimes takes Holmes off in slightly different directions or treats him with slightly different handling, ""The Eligible Bachelor"" does push the boundaries of Brett's take on Holmes to the limit, with psychological and quasi-mystical elements that certainly aren't part of standard Holmes fair.  Here we see a Holmes plagued by dreams that seem to foretell aspects of the future, we witness some of the darker underside of Victorian London (let's face it, such an underside did exist) and generally see the facts of the original story jumbled about for the sake of extending the run time to nearly two hours.

But if it boils down to a simple question, ""Will I add 'The Eligible Bachelor"" to my collection of DVD's, the answer is ""Yes"".  For all it's unexpected quirks, I found myself enjoying it very much.  While it will never rank as one of my most favorite Granada productions of Holmes, I will be sure to watch it again.

I realize as I write this that one who hasn't yet seen it might wonder ""If it's so quirky and off beat, what is it that he found about this film to enjoy""?  That's a fair question.  Let's think.  1)  As mentioned, it was great to discover an episode I hadn't seen before.  When I stumbled upon it, I was quite surprised.  I guess it's lack of popularity made it an infrequent candidate for TV or video rental availability.  2) I enjoy the occasional bending of the Holmesian rules, and this provides that while maintaining pretty good production values in other respects. 3) OK, it's true, Paris Jefferson brightens up the screen in a way I must admit I appreciate very much.  4) Casting in general was, I thought, very good, but Ms. Jefferson was a delightful new find for me.  5)  At some point I just stop analyzing things and ask myself ""are you enjoying this or not?"" ... and I did.

So there you have it.  Make up your own mind.",1334707200,,2618,4.594827586206897
1809440,3,B00007G1WN,"""The Eligible Bachelor"" was one of three feature-length episodes made for ""The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes"" television series in the early 1990s, along with ""The Master Blackmailer"" and ""The Last Vampyre"". Unlike the earlier feature-length episodes in Granada's Sherlock Holmes series, which were based on novels by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, these later episodes were expanded to feature length from short stories. As a result, there is a lot of filler, and the writers have the opportunity to take more liberties with characters and story. While the later, 1990s, entries in Granada's Sherlock Holmes series were undoubtedly inferior to those made in the 1980s, it is interesting to note that the writer's had something specific in mind when they took these stories over the top.

""The Eligible Bachelor"" is a much-embellished version of the short story ""The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor"". Lord Robert St. Simon (Simon Williams) is engaged to marry the enchanting young American heiress Hattie Doran (Paris Jefferson) in a classic case of old title and new money. Hattie is taken with Robert's ancestral home, a dilapidated castle no longer fit for occupation, and hopes to live there. But she disappears on her wedding day shortly after Robert's former mistress, the actress Flora Miller (Joanna McCallum), makes a drunken scene at the reception. When Scotland Yard makes little progress, Lord Robert hires Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett) to find his missing bride. But a mysterious woman in a black veil sends Holmes a cryptic message, implying that Robert has some dark secrets.

Holmes is overwrought, insomniac, and regretting the demise of Prof. Moriarty that deprived him of a worthy adversary. Dr. Watson is concerned about his state of mind. Holmes is out of character, and there is an abundance of pointless filler. It's interesting, though, that the writers chose to evoke typical motifs of Victorian potboilers in expanding upon the story. There are women in peril, a devious rake, exotic animals, and extra-sensory perception. It's sensationalist melodrama in the Victorian style. And it takes Holmes right over the top with it. It's a poor fit for Holmes, the deductive rationalist. But, as a shilling-shocker, it's archetypal. I can't say this attempt to marry the two opposite sides of the Victorian cultural coin is successful. How could it be? But it is not simply sloppy, as it may at first appear.",1285891200,,2419,5.168367346938775
1809461,1,B00007G1WN,"Toward the end of the run of the Granada TV Sherlocks with Jeremy Brett, someone decided that the Arthur Conan Doyle stories weren't good enough and needed ""improving.""  So they expanded the running time from 50 minutes to 90 minutes and threw out the simple, straightforward narratives provided by Doyle and made up new, heavily-padded extravaganzas based only remotely on the short stories after which they're named.  This is by far the worst, and that's saying something.  Diffuse, self-consciously arty, and full of needless screaming and squawking and ham-acting to goose it up into the higher realms of kitsch, this is a horrible waste of Jeremy Brett's failing health.  Ditto ""The Last Vampyre,"" made at the same time-- hard to tell which is worse, really, now that I think about it.

Watch any of the early episodes from the series ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"" or ""The Return of Sherlock Holmes.""  By the time they got to ""The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes"" and ""The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes,"" the series was running on fumes.  Whatever you do, avoid this monstrosity!",1285804800,8,1083,4.983333333333333
1809462,2,B00007G1WN,"We watched this movie before reading any of the reviews and came to a very similar conclusion with most of them. This was a choppy, disjointed movie that left one wondering; ""what was that all about?"" It presented a version of Holmes that was too over-the-top for me to enjoy.

As some have pointed out the one hour episodes aired on ""Mystery Theater"" all seem to maintain a crisp focus which this movie lacked. The over-long section on Holmes dreams definitely looked like filler to use up more time; which to me was time wasted.

At the end, efforts were made to tie all of the loose ends together and as far as I recall they were pretty much eventually explained.

I'm sure I will not watch this one again and would strongly suggest if anyone is curious about this movie, rent it first and see what you think before making a purchase decision.",1281052800,4,846,4.48051948051948
1809463,2,B00007G1WN,"This is a very strange film with very little of Conan Doyle in it. I think the best way to explain it is to remind the viewer of those dreary films made of Dickens' novels, where the screenwriters left out Dickens' humor and exaggerated the squalor for visual effect. You know, those films where Victorian London is depicted as a violent and vile Bedlam, in which all aristocrats are either sadists or madmen and all guttersnipes are virtuous? Well, this film is made in this vein.

The screenwriter and director obviously want to make a social commentary on the inequalities of Victorian England and to achieve that they happily dismantle the character of Holmes and unapologetically turn a light and humorous Conan Doyle story into a species of Victorian Gothic, somewhere between steampunk and the Bronte sisters.

Holmes is depicted as a whimpering neurotic with an infantile penchant for running out of doors in his nightshirt and bare feet. To make things worse he is tormented by a recurring precognitive dream of which he can make neither head nor tail. He then develops a penchant for drawing and produces a series of Screaming Man -like sketches that upset poor old Watson. Not to be outdone, Watson spends his days locking distressed damsels into lunatic asylums and discoursing on Freud. They both seem to suffer from seasonal-affective disorder, understandable due to the fact that the London they inhabit is swathed in peasouper fogs around the clock.

When the American bride of a retentive aristocrat goes missing from her wedding breakfast Holmes is called upon to seek her. This proves to be rather difficult despite the fact that the bride speaks pure Ozark, has very white teeth and says 'goddam!' to butlers. To complicate matters Holmes and Watson are haunted by a veiled lady while the noble Lord St Simon is haunted by a boozy actress and a Scrooge-like creditor. While the police are dutifully trawling the Serpentine in Hyde Park Holmes discovers that the confounded toff keeps mislaying his wives, much like a modern Bluebeard: one is dead, the other presumed insane and the third now vanished.

The adventure takes us to a haunted castle inhabited by an escaped murderer who patrols the grounds while dressed as if on his way to a steampunk meet, a leopard who doesn't like eating young girls and a supposed madwoman with a gift for structural engineering who is imprisoned in a ruined chapel and whom Holmes recognises as a character from his dream.

By the time the film draws to a clause Holmes seems to have overcome his habitual dislike of womankind and is taking the recovered madwoman to the opera while Watson is accompanying her sister, the unveiled veiled lady. May we hope for a double romance?

To sum up the film is well worth watching as an unintended comedy. It made me laugh but I fear for all the wrong reasons.",1278201600,10,2856,4.830265848670757
1809464,5,B00007G1WN,Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwick in Sherlock Holmes are beyond excellent!  Brett gives such depth of performance as Holmes and is masterful.  Hardwick so superbly portrays Watson.  Both are so much better than Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce ever were.,1227571200,,251,5.225
1809465,2,B00007G1WN,"I watched what I believe is Granada's version of the Noble Bachelor.
It is one of the longer episodes in the series, and I think I waited until I watched everything else before I tackled this.

So, one lazy Saturday afternoon I popped in the dvd and let 'er rip.

Very nice costumes, lovely locations, and savvy casting as always, with a veddy British guy in a super-snazzy RED coat.

I let this run along for a while, vaguely aware that it followed the canon story that I had only read once. I kept waiting for it to get interesting, and when poor Jemery appeared, in his usual cadaverous appearance
of these later productions, I got very depressed watching him trying to go through the motions, and I thankfully fell asleep.

When I finally awoke, it was near the end of the show, and all I remember was that the guy with the RED coat was out in some woods somewhere around some ruins, and he kept looking at a clearing below him, and that this hand came out of the ground, and the hand had long, pointy nails, and was very dirty.

The coat guy noticed this, and began to look worriedly at it.

Then, the hand moves around a bit, and then, a very filthy, nasty, incredibly dirty girlish-looking person comes up out of the leaves that she was lying in, and starts snarling and grimmicing and so forth, showing her rotten teeth, and then I seem to remember that this person gets hold of a chain that is connected to a stone archway that the coat guy is standing next to, and pulls the whole mess down onto the poor guy, and he gets squished.

Then, miraculously, Holmes appears again, and the nasty person comes up onto the remainder of the ruins where the guy was, and Holmes holds the nasty person in a very tender caress.

aaaw[...] . .

Well, that's all I seem to recall of this monstrosity, and I can well see why Brett opted out of any more Holmes fiascos like this. I know that he died before he could finish the series, but he still wanted no more to do with the morons who hatched this mess.",1217635200,3,2000,4.312
1809466,4,B00007G1WN,"This film has been slammed by Sherlockian purists, but I think it deserves a second look.  Indeed, it REQUIRES a second look due to its obscurity and the numerous departures from the original story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.

I am a fan of David Lynch, so I am perhaps more tolerant of obscurity than the average moviegoer.  That kind of tolerance is needed with this movie. In the original Doyle story, the bachelor - Lord St. Simon - is a somewhat sympathetic figure.  Here, he is pure evil.  And screenwriter T. R. Bowen has introduced other elements - Freudianism, nitemarish dreams, etc. - totally alien to the world of Doyle.  And we also see - apart from the controversial elements in the script - a Jeremy Brett in obvious physical decline.  All in all, these things combine to make a very dark and eerie movie.

Yet, I think this film has its merits.  It is a MOVING film, showing the vulnerability both of Holmes and of his real-life counterpart, Jeremy Brett.  There is a sadness to it, a feeling of decline, of death.  Yes, you sense that Holmes is close to death.  And that, in my mind, adds nobility to Holmes's efforts on behalf of Henrietta Doran, splendidly played by the beautiful Paris Jefferson.  (And she is VERY beautiful, almost preternaturally so.)

So an obviously weakened Holmes, disturbed by dreams he cannot understand, an ill and irritable Holmes, gets on his feet and pursues yet another villain.  And I would ask the Holmes purists - is that not what Holmes is all about?  Is that not the chivalrous Holmes we love?  And why can't we love him in his weakness as well as in his strength?

I admit, the film has its shortcomings.  It could have been better, less obscure, and the storyline is perhaps a bit more bizarre - and unbelieveable - than it needed to be.  But in the end, it is true to Holmes, true to his courage, true to his humanity.  I hope that is good enough.",1167955200,12,1904,4.508771929824562

This movie is based on the story ""The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor"" (1892) written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859 to 1930).

Contrary to what many of the reviews below this one state, the length of this movie is 1 3/4 hours.  (For confirmation of this fact, check the ""Product Details"" above.)

This is not a traditional ""Sherlock Holmes"" movie starring Jeremy Brett in the title character and Edward Hardwicke as Dr. Watson.  Instead the viewer is presented with a series of clues interspersed throughout the movie and the viewer along with Sherlock puts these clues together to solve the mystery.  Some viewers (especially those with a short attention span) may see this format as ""weird"" but personally I liked it since it really kept me thinking until the end.

The key to understanding and appreciating this movie is to realize that this movie gradually reveals clues while alternating with the main storyline.

The storyline itself is quite simple.  Lord Robert St. Simon (Simon Williams), seemingly the most eligible bachelor in London, after a courtship, marries a wealthy American woman, Henrietta ""Hettie"" Doran (Paris Jefferson).  But rather than being a happy occasion, the young couple's wedding day turns to tragedy when an unwelcome guest named Flora Miller (Joanna McCullum) arrives at the wedding breakfast, and the bride disappears.  It is at this point that Holmes is officially called in by St. Simon to investigate.

Some interspersed clues include:

(1) Holmes at what appears to be an insane asylum
(2) Sherlock having a strange, recurring dream or nightmare
(3) scenes of a theatre group
(4) the money problems of St. Simon
(5) a mysterious veiled lady
(6) a printed note sent to Sherlock that says, ""What of ladies Maud and Helena?""
(7) a torn letter found in the pocket of Hettie's wedding dress signed ""F.M.""

This movie conveys Sherlock's recurring dream quite well.  (Some viewer's may see the depiction of this dream as ""weird."")  Holmes describes his dream to Dr. Watson:

""I'm fighting with Moriarty [Sherlock's archenemy] at the [river] falls then suddenly I'm overwhelmed with a sense of loss...fear...empty rooms, I have no sense of scale-a huge chair which diminishes, its upholstery torn to shreds.  I'm struggling to escape from a marsh...a quagmire...then appears an androgynous creature, witch-like, hag-like with claws...which reach out to me...and I'm trapped in a mesh of cobwebs and I [then] awake.""

The interspersed clues and the main storyline gradually come together and form a satisfying conclusion to the mystery.

Brett despite his real-life health problems does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance.  Simon Williams as the eligible bachelor also gives a convincing performance.  Also look for the fine performance of Joanna McCullum as Flora Miller.

Finally, the props, costumes, background music, cinematography, and especially the photography are quite well done.

In conclusion, this is a good and different type of Sherlock Holmes' movie that's fun to watch even if you have read the story it's based on!!!

1809469,2,B00007G1WN,"I am giving this film an extra star out of respect for actors Brett and Hardwicke, and for a few of the looney, arty camera shots that are used to conjure a bizarre tone for this overlong ""Sherlock Holmes"" story. However, there is good bizarre and there is bad bizarre. Good bizarre, as in other Brett/Holmes films such as ""Wisteria Lodge"" and ""The Golden Pince-Nez,"" use unusual cinematography to add to the story's fun rather than distract from it. Bad bizarre, such as this mess, has no fun in it to begin with, and falls back on weird, disturbing images to compensate. For many years Jeremy Brett played the great sleuth with neurotic panache in well-made, tight, amusing films that stayed very close to the Conan Doyle stories on which they were made. Unfortunately, in Brett's declining years they put this fine actor in three stinkers (""The Master Blackmailer,"" ""The Last Vampyre,"" and this, the worst of the lot) that took perfectly good Doyle stories and tried to drag them out to two hour epics by padding them with a lot of extra crap by modern screenwriters, all of whom for some reason decided that late Victorian London should be shown as an extremely squalid place filled with cackling hags, drunks, weird spectacled psychotics, suicidal gays, and Holmes himself going to pieces, sobbing and simpering most unlike the Holmes we all know and love. In keeping with the style of many television films of this era, this one seems jumpy, quick-cut, and random. After several scenes that each last all of five seconds, I begin to wonder where on earth the art of storytelling has gone. This overwrought bummer of a movie is best forgotten, and those wishing to enjoy a great Sherlock Holmes mystery might best go and watch ""The Sign of Four,"" another long, bizarre story that has all the good qualities this one lacks: humor, plot, faithfulness to Doyle, fine production, and a great sleuth.",1104710400,35,1900,4.795731707317073
1809470,5,B00007G1WN,"Although one appreciates most of the Granada Sherlock Holmes series for its faithful evocation of the ACD stories, this hugely expanded and utterly loose adaptation of 'The Noble Bachelor' (surely one of the lesser adventures as even the purists must admit) scores as a weird, mostly brilliant and vastly improved version of the original tale.

To the flimsy story of the American bride-to-be of a nobleman, who goes suddenly missing on her wedding, we are given a Holmes who is ill and suffering from a singular grotesque dream that repeatedly plagues him, and a nobleman who may not be quite as noble. In this story the director has actually taken advantage of Brett's bloated and haggard frame to give us a haunted, beleaguered Holmes who must pursue a case if only to keep off his own demons. The story is rich with interestingly flawed characters that function as more than the usual mouthpiece of information. Even old Mrs. Hudson is given more depth with an affectionate glance at her quasi-matronly relationship with Holmes.

The film has been crafted with great visual flair, noticeably more than the short episodes of the series. Holmes' hallucination and his attempt to transcribe it into sketches make for some awesome viewing. There's a very stylish use of color and lighting (DoP David Odd), and the camera movements and cutting are often eye-catching. It's really the most 'cinematic' of all the Brett-Holmes series I've so far seen.

Some people may not like it as much since Holmes is not here the imperturbable sleuth, and most of the story moves along without him playing a very active role. A few scenes are contrived to the limits of credibility. But I thought it was all the same a very interesting and visually ravishing attempt to stage an originally mediocre story.",1099180800,6,1790,4.920529801324503

7976226,3,B00007G1WN,"The Eligible Bachelor is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's short 1886 19-page story (in The Annotated Sherlock Holmes by Baring-Gould) where the tale is titled ""The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor."" Both titles are meant to be ironic. The nobleman in the tale is not a noble person, quite the contrary. Nor is he eligible, as the story makes clear. The film makes extensive changes in Doyle's story, which I hope to make clear in a review of the original story. I am not doing so here so as not to spoil the film for those who wish to see it. I gave the film only three stars because first and foremost, I think Jeremy Brett's acting as Sherlock in this and some other films is overdone: he agonizes over much. People, including Dr. Watson, even thought he was sick. I see no need for so elaborate display of his boredom. I also saw some irrational acts in the film which I will mention when I review the story itself. Despite this, I did not give it two stars because the film did hold my interest.",1502236800,,999,4.347593582887701
7976227,1,B00007G1WN,"The Eligible Bachelor, 1992 film

A woman screams as she if forcefully taken away by two men to an insane asylum. Holmes returns home alone. A nobleman shows his family estate to Hetty, but she cant visit for now. Hetty is a miners daughter. Does Holmes have a nightmare? A mansion prepares for an event, guests talk about Hetty. [There are a number of confusing scenes, as if there was some conflict over this story.] That nobleman has less income than he needs for his station in life, but marriage to the daughter of a very wealthy man will change that. The bride drops her bouquet, a man in a pew returns it to her.

Mrs. Hudson calls Dr. Watson for Holmes, who is emotional over his dreams. Is Holmes eating well? Wedding guests comment on the brides behavior. Flora Miller visits Lord Robert but is rejected. The bride has disappeared! They call the police. Holmes gets a letter about that Lord St. Simon wedding, then the Lord himself appears. There is a not about Maud and Helena, who are they? Lord Robert explains curtly. The police found Hettys wedding dress in a pond. Flora Miller tells Holmes how she helped Hetty buy new clothes. Later a woman with a veil visits them to tell about Helenas fate, and her own.

Lord Roberts first wife was murdered while they visited France. Holmes and Watson go to an expensive hotel and meet Frances Moulton. There is an accident in a theater. Holmes and Watson go to Lord Roberts mansion to seek Hetty. Lord Robert talks to Hetty in a frank manner now! Can Holmes and Watson rescue Hetty? Lord Robert goes to an old building which is in need of repair and has an accident. A captive is freed, is it Helena? Will there be happiness for the Moultons? [Why leave California or America?]

This story was modified or distorted by its changes. I found it confusing in parts. Read the original story The Noble Bachelor for yourself. What was Lord Roberts need for money that put him in the power of moneylenders? You can only guess. Too bad good sense cant be inherited like a noble title or wealth.",1497484800,,2042,4.5257452574525745

7976229,1,B00007G1WN,"A first year film school student suffering from the flu and delirious with fever, downs a whole bottle of cough syrup then falls asleep reading The Noble Bachelor and proceeds to have a drug crazed fever dream.  At least that's my theory on how this film was conceived.  As a huge fan of Granada's Sherlock Holmes series (though I haven't seen every episode, but most), I really wanted to like this movie.  I've avoided it for years not only because I'd heard such bad things about it, but also because The Noble Bachelor is not one of my favorite Holmes stories and I couldn't imagine it being turned into one of the feature length TV movies.  But I'd heard how far they strayed from the source material which I suspected might actually be a good thing.  And I like a lot of movies that people generally dislike so I thought I might just enjoy this and went into it with high hopes.  I should have believed the hype though, it's just dumb mess of a movie.  The beginning is almost incomprehensible and I had no clue what the heck was going on.  It is trying WAY too hard to be weird and cerebral that it just gets bogged down in its own stupidity and smugness.  I didn't think it was all terrible though, I actually liked some of the things they did with the story.  Obviously the whole plotline about Holmes having psychic premonitions through his dreams was dumb, but the changes they made to the source material with the titular bachelor's previous wives and criminal activities was pretty good.  Had they just made a straight/intelligible movie using that plot it would have been pretty good I think.  Instead they tried to turn it into some weird, dream-like supernatural thriller or something.  And failed.",1477526400,,1713,4.595394736842105
