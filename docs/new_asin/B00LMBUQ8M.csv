6491468,5,B00LMBUQ8M,"I am slightly obsessed with this show. The cast is beguiling and seductive, the storyline for both season 1 and season 2 is gripping, and I cannot wait until season 3. This show, especially season one, reminds me of the first Twilight movie. Other than the obvious reasons, it's also the modest budget value on some of the details (like the driving scenes / green screen)...but also the chemistry of the cast and the electricity of the shock value of some of the (literally) jaw dropping effects. Lili Taylor seems to be the voice of reason and has some wise anecdotes to play as the straight man to the campy horror. Taylor and the beautiful Famke Janssen were also costars in The House on Haunted Hill...another great one in this same sort of genre. I think it's great for what it is. Also for fans of this show I recommend American Horror Story: Coven.",1405987200,6,855,4.558441558441558
6491469,1,B00LMBUQ8M,"Being one of Netflix's new original shows, HEMLOCK GROVE is its first foray into seralized horror. As executive produced by Eli Roth of CABIN FEVER and the first two HOSTEL films, you know the standard for gore, torture, evisceration and the like are going to be on display in copious amounts.

And while there isn't much on-screen torture, there is plenty in watching this anti-TWILIGHT silliness.

The murder mystery that envelops this show revolves a around two young high school students in the smallish town of Hemlock Grove, Pennsylvania: There's the entitled and bratty Roman Godfrey (Bill Skarsgard) and the rugged bad-boy Peter Rumancek(Landon Liboiron). Roman is the heir apparent to the Godfrey fortune and company, with his predatory mother Olivia (Famke Janssen) holding the leash. Peter is living in something approximating a mobile home with his friendly, accepting mother Lynda (Lili Taylor). Well, as it turns out, Peter is a werewolf. Roman is... something that likes to drink blood. As the plot thickens, so does the predictibility. There's Roman's cousin Letha (Penelope Mitchell, who Roman seems to have a creepy, incest-y obsession with) who of course falls for Peter; there's Olivia creepily obsessing over her son and incessantly having sex with her husband's brother Norman (Dougray Scott); there's the creepy little girl Christina (Freya Tingley) who is inexplicably obsessed with Peter and his lycanthropy; there's the secret church organization that is hunting down monsters, and there's the mad scientist who might be succeeding at playing God.

There are a few surprises though. Easily the most interesting character is that of Shelley, the mute and hideously deformed sister of Roman. She's a great character, and one that the show could have focused more of its attention on. The other surprise, although it shouldn't really be a surprise in Eli Roth territory is the visual effects, which are absolutely tremendous. The werewolf transformation sequence for Peter is probably the highlight of the show.

However, for a show that is so obviously pulpy, most of the actors play it far too straight. Liboiron is a strong actor but he just is SO OVERWHELMINGLY SOLEMN that it becomes painful to watch. Dougray Scott is painfully bad in this show as well. He just seems so sleepy, which I think is still just regret from turning down the role of Wolverine in the X-MEN films for playing the villain in MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2, but more than likely, he's just cashing a check here. Only Famke Janssen and her bizarre eurotrash accent seems to know what kind of show this should be. Another problem is that the material itself takes itself too seriously. What could have been a fun, bizarre excursion into Grand Guignol territory is filled with rape, gruesome and explicit child murders, incest, and an all-too-serious tone.

Still, I could look past some of the faults with the show's execution because it did hold my interest, and once you invest a certain amount of time with something, you just have to see how it plays out. But the events of the finale episode were so embarassingly stupid and over-blown and ugly that it exhausted any good will I had for the show, taking it from a three-star to a one-star show. Yes, really bad finales can ruin everything that comes before. And then, of course, is the whole vampire/werewolf thing. The show is based on a novel which was written in the aftermath of the TWILIGHT phenomenon, and this show takes great pains to try to differentiate itself from the sparkly vampires and the hunky werewolves by providing the antithesis of each character from that series as well as the aforementioned extreme gore and sex and nudity, but it just ends up playing out as another entry of the allegorical tales of estranged, misunderstood young outsiders.

Another really important thing about this show: IT'S NOT SCARY. AT ALL. There were no moments that had me jumping out of my seat, or really creeping me out other than the things that are incredibly offensive (the child murders, the incest, the rape, etc.).

If HEMLOCK GROVE could have attempted to project more camp and attempted to rein in the self-seriousness, this could be a wildly successful show, but like just about everything that Eli Roth is creatively involved with, it's a lot of sound and fury that ends up signifying nothing.",1405900800,5,4354,4.988980716253444
6491470,4,B00LMBUQ8M,"Love the show, but too much money for 12 episodes. I will be waiting for the price to come down. 4 stars for price.",1405728000,2,115,3.8333333333333335
6491471,5,B00LMBUQ8M,"Hemlock Grove is something new, it isn't your typical Vampire/Werewolf show. The characters are well rounded, the visual effects are stunning and the story is fresh. The first season has some weak points when it comes to the acting and things can become confusing (but all gets cleared on season 2, so if you have netflix, get on it). But I don't think the weak points are enough to damage  the rating in anyway.

It's not for everyone, there are some trigger warnings to be aware of (such as rape and incest) but it is a good show. It has an attractive cast, well rounded characters, drama and horror. It'll definitely take you on a wild ride.",1405555200,18,644,4.495726495726496
6491472,1,B00LMBUQ8M,This show is so trite and contrived.  It is pseudo-sophisticated poorly acted garbage.  Basically the whole show is high school kids trying to seem mysterious and unaffected when it actually comes off as bad acting and lots of pouting.  Famke Janssen has never been worse.  Her accent is ridiculous and unidentifiable.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.,1405468800,5,356,5.175438596491228
6491473,4,B00LMBUQ8M,"HORROR ARCHETYPES DISTILLED DOWN TO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SLIGHTLY MORE HUMAN

In an early episodes we are given one of the keys to understanding this complex show. One of the characters compares a maze with a labyrinth. A labyrinth is not intended to mislead us, but always takes us in the correct direction no matter where it winds. This is true of the show also. It's never really trying to trick us with false leads so it can surprise us later. The show mainly feels impenetrable because it gives us many significant mysteries instead of just one. For most of the show, it introduces perhaps more mysteries than it does clues. But, they do not necessarily contradict each other. The last few episodes do bring more revelations and conclusions. The story has excellent flow despite reviews you may see. It just doesn't allow us to see everything we think it should at times. The most important thing to accept is that not all mysteries will be solved in a single season. The viewer has to absorb what is happening and wait as we progress through the labyrinth. Many people simply won't enjoy this format and that's completely valid. The viewer has to be willing to absorb some concepts and then set them on the shelf until they are addressed at a later time. It takes trust that we will understand each mystery eventually at different and deliberate moments.

THE PLOT: The very basic plot is a murder mystery wrapped in something much bigger and even darker than that. Peter and his mother are Romanian gypsy descendants who move back to Hemlock Grove, Pennsylvania. About the same time, murders of young girls begin to occur. Oh, Peter happens to turn into a wolf each month. Peter befriends Roman Godfrey, the son of a wealthy steel producing family that now owns a biomedical research company called the Godfrey Institute. Perhaps Peter feels some sort of kinship or trust in Roman because he also seems so unusual. In fact, there is something seriously off about the wealthy Godfrey family. In Hemlock Grove, everyone seems to be hiding some sort of secret. Roman Godfrey's sister Shelley is the one person who actually has the outward appearance of some sort of monster, yet is probably the one truly and completely good person in Hemlock Grove. Peter and Roman team up to stop whatever is committing the murders while a seemingly incongruous plot line emerges about extraordinary experiments being conducted in the ""White Tower"" as the Godfrey Institute is called. The plot further thickens as another character is introduced as a member of secret organization who hunts Peter's kind and is associating him with the murders.

Part of the strength of this show is that it keeps much of the supernatural in the periphery of our view.  This allows the show to maintain some skillful mystique. We do see the change of the wolf however, and it is very inventive. This show is excellent at making the supernatural seem almost normal. As I mentioned, old horror archetypes are distilled down, reinvented and made somewhat more human, and mysterious.  This is one of the other keys to understanding and accepting the show if you can.  Part of the fun is identifying the archetypes as they are presented.  Sometimes they are more subtle.  The show is graphic, but a little less absurd than we usually see. The director and cast go way out of their way to create fascinating characters. Overall the production values and acting are outstanding. However, there are small examples of poor acting here and there. It's the only reason I dropped it to four stars instead of five. Keep in mind that five stars doesn't mean everyone will love it. People will hate the format I mentioned. The show is profane, bloody, disturbing and inappropriate in many places. However, it is complex and expertly constructed with fantastic character development and atmosphere. It walks a fine line of maintaining a little classic film style mystique, while giving modern audiences the shocking situations and gore they are used to.  I wouldn't have thought it could be done but this show demonstrates that it can, so far.",1405209600,50,4102,4.848571428571429

6491494,2,B00LMBUQ8M,"In Hemlock Grove, teenaged girls are found disemboweled in the woods, and the main suspect is new kid in town and werewolf, Peter. As the show progresses, Peter befriends Roman Godfrey, the arrogant heir apparent to a biomedical research company. He's also a supernatural creature, himself, but doesn't know it beyond the ability to compel people to do his bidding. Peter falls in love with Roman's cousin, Letha, who may or may not have been impregnated by an angel. The story has promise as a grittier alternative to the YA vampires and wolves that abound, but the execution never quite allows it to flourish.

The cast is wonderful, but the characters never quite connected with each other for me (except for Roman and his sensitive sister, Shelley). Dr. Chasseur (Kandyse McClure) and Olivia (Famke Janssen), in particular, are done a disservice by the awful direction of this show. The issue is the horrid dialogue. It's bad. Really bad. For one, every other sentence feels like a slur against the Romany, the developmentally disabled, and LGBT. I have no problem with gritty language or profanity, but it just didn't make sense to me in the context of the characters or this show. More generally, the dialogues fails to reveal character motivation, move the plot along, or show any wit.

Second, the show doesn't care about the details. I don't know how many times a character commented on how hirsute Peter was when the actor isn't at all. Adapt the dialogue to the actors you've actually hired. The show veers into unintentional hilarity (or, rather, cringe-worthy territory) all the time. From Olivia's bizarre accent to Peter's awful haircut in the season finale, the show sometimes feels like an SNL skit of itself.

Third, and most importantly, there wasn't enough background mythology. For the first two episodes, I was nearly convinced Hemlock Grove takes place in a world where werewolves are known because the characters spoke of Peter being one so nonchalantly. The show would've been more interesting if that were so. At the least, they should have dived deeper into the Slavic mythology they based these characters on.

The thirteen episodes could have been condensed by a third to allow for better pacing. I don't buy that the slow burn allowed for character and relationship development. You'll care less about both with each drudging episode. By the time the season finale comes around (the best episode of the series), it's hard to even care that you're finally getting some pay-off. I also have to mention the completely inexplicable fact that Roman raped one of his classmates, made her forget it, and then received a get-well card from her in the next episode. And that's that? Repulsive.

I'm still going to give the second season a try. Like I said, the idea of the characters (far more than how they are actually presented) is interesting enough to warrant another try.",1424304000,2,2898,4.942505133470226

6491501,5,B00LMBUQ8M,"Oh dear, yet another high-school vampire / werewolf genre series, you might think. On the surface youd be right but this shows weirdness takes it way off the well trodden genre trail pioneered by the still unrivalled Buffy.

Set in the fictional Pennsylvania (again  a lot seems to happen there at the moment) town of Hemlock Grove though actually filmed in Canada, this season follows the hunt for the beastly perpetrator of a series of grisly murders which start, coincidentally, with the arrival of a gipsy boy and his mother. Unsurprisingly, there is no shortage of strange goins-on, centred mostly around Peter, the aforementioned gypsy and Roman, the spoilt rich-kid son of the most peculiar Olivia Godfrey.

Much death, mayhem and general oddness ensues while they track down the mythical beast, mostly driving about in Romans lovely red car (a 1961 Jaguar XK150 as it turns out). Confounding their efforts along the way is the slightly bonkers Van Helsing-like Dr. Chasseur as she conducts her own werewolf hunt under the auspices of a shady secret religious order not entirely unlike the Iluminati.

While the main plot lines progress we learn more of Romans Upir (a mythological Russian part witch, part daemon with some very unpleasant habits) heritage, his Lurchesque utterly likeable sister, Olivias beginnings and hints of the dubious moral nature of the work of the Godfrey institute headed by the odd (everybody in Hemlock Grove is odd) Dr. Johann Pryce.

It is a peculiar, improbably successful, blend of almost every element from the genre, standard fantasy themes, some Grimm-like mythology and bits of sci-fi held together by sharp writing and solid performances from the main cast. Apart from one thoroughly surreal episode (although at least I now know what catabasis is) the season piles along at a very acceptable pace with never a dull moment. Season two premiered on US television in July 2014 so hopefully we won't have to wait too long for the next installment of the splendidly odd, strangely engrossing show.",1421539200,,2038,5.071641791044776

The camera work and color palettes are gorgeous on a huge 4K screen; the colors of the countryside and the sterile architecture of the biotech company function as a Greek chorus, commenting on the action.
Landon Liboiron seems to be another sweet guy on the Kit Harrington (Jon Snow on GoT) channel, but LL has a more subtle role to play here than does Kit, and LL's subtle punim (Yiddish for an adorable or pouting face) manifests a wide expressive range of inward, loving feelings.
The plot? Two mother-and-son dynamics face off against each other in all the spooky pagan ways that patriarchal monotheism and its deputy sheriff Western Science make it impossible to enjoy with a straight face.  I've avoided Eli Roth's work all these years because I was a jealous colleague of his psychiatrist father Sheldon in 1968, but despite Eli's vainglorious omnipresence in the credits, I gotta admit I find this a superb work of art that I would recommend to anyone over age 13.  Famke Janssen plays the only truly despicable character, and even she can evoke sympathy, at least from me.

Don't get me wrong, Hemlock does make sense and answers a lot of questions, but it is slower paced than your standard TV supernatural type show. Hemlock Grove never disappoints those who give it a chance and actively watch. I say actively, because, if you try to watch, like most people do, while on your phone, or doing homework, or otherwise ""multitasking,"" you will miss so much. Occasionally, you may have to rewind and re-watch a scene just to make sure you get all the hidden points. (Why does Famke Janssen's character always wear white?)

Well, I watched all of Season 1 and I'm still interested so there's that.  I thought the show started off pretty strong and I was hooked at first.  Then, it got kind of meh, some boring episodes where nothing was really happening and then became this Supernatural Days of Our Lives.  The acting isn't bad per say, but it's not great either.  Unlike other Netflix originals, this one's not winning any awards.  However, there is something about Peter and Roman, their friendship and their supernatural sides that keep you interested and wanting to know what's going to happen next.  If you only tune in to watch the werewolf transformation, it's worth it.  I have never seen anything like that in any other movie or TV show.  That was so disturbing.  Shelley, Roman's sister, is sort of like Frankenstein's monster, but is the sweetest most gentle character on the show.  I loved Roman's relationship with her.  He loves her so much and he's so protective of her.

There has been a brutal murder of a young woman in the small town of Hemlock Grove that looks to be caused by an animal.  Peter Romancek and his mother are gypsies and are new in town and soon a rumor has spread through town that Peter is a werewolf and is the one responsible for killing the girl.  He befriends Roman Godfrey, a spoiled rich boy, who has a penchant for blood but is not sure why  - yet.  Roman has a very sweet and protective side to him when it comes to his sister and his cousin, Letha.  You get the impression he is actually in love with his cousin.  Soon after the first, another girl is murdered and Roman and Peter decide to team up and find the ""wolf"" responsible for the killings before anymore girls are attacked.

This show is pretty campy, like True Blood, very gory with a lot of sex.  Funny that Roman is played by Bill Skarsgard who is Alexander Skarsgard's (Eric Northman of TB) little brother and they both play vampires.

For the most part, I enjoyed the show and I still want to watch it. Here's hoping that Season 2 won't disappoint.",1411689600,12,2051,4.486486486486487

8666612,5,B00LMBUQ8M,Haunting and hideous! Not for the squeamish. The Hemlock Grove saga leaves any and all other monster soaps in the darkest of shadows. The SPFX and art direction are feature film quality and the writing and cast are top notch. Best monster fest I have ever seen produced for TV. I have only one criticism. And I won't tell you what it is. The rest rest of the trip makes it worth it.,1506470400,,382,4.2465753424657535

8666617,5,B00LMBUQ8M,"I love, love, love Hemlock Grove.  It's got enough creep factor, suspense and general ""weirdness"" to keep most viewers intrigued. Maybe it's not for everyone, but if you like your horror with a heaping scoop of STRANGE, this should be right up your alley.  Great casting, too -- Season 1 was my personal favorite although the others are definitely worth a look if you enjoy the first season.",1485820800,,391,4.735294117647059
