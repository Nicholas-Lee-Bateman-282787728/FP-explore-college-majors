2236576,5,B0007R6Y06,"I'm one of the few that enjoyed Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland so I was excited to hear that they were making a sequel. It's been six years since the first film was released but the wait is worth it.
Alice Through The Looking Glass is a solid sequel that brings back all the elements that made the original film so good: the delightful cast is stronger and better than ever, Mia Wasikowska shines again as Alice, and Helena Bonhan Carter, Anne Hathaway and Johnny Depp deliver strong performances as well. The special effects are stunning and beautifully made, and the storyline is entertaining from beginning to end, providing witty jokes, and a perfectly executed script. It's a film
that kids and adults will love.
I'm just sad to read it flopped on the US box office, to me, it was a delightful ride that I'm buying on Blu-Ray as soon as it comes out, I even dare to say that is better than the first film. It reminds me of how badly last year's Tomorrowland was treated, to me, the best live action Disney film from 2015. Hopefully Alice does better on the International office, because it truly deserves it. Although it might feel a little unnecessary at first, give it a chance and you'll love the film; this is Alice reloaded, bigger and better! Catch it on theaters while you can and have an open mind and you'll end up loving it just like I did.",1464480000,118,1357,4.475806451612903
2236577,5,B0007R6Y06,"This was fantastic!! The plot, the characters, the world-building, the nods to the literary work. This was a sequel that stands with the original in majesty. Very little in way of reference to the actual text, which works, this was an original tale in the world.",1464307200,9,262,4.717391304347826
2236578,4,B0007R6Y06,"I don't follow upcoming movies nearly as much as I used to, so I hadnt heard Disney was making Alice Through the Looking Glass until this year.  I honestly wasn't sure whether to be excited, warry, or both.  I enjoyed Tim Burtons 2010 variation on the classic to a certain extent, and since this was going to be a sequel without him involved, it could be good or horrible.  And they weren't even thinking about following the book with the same name but doing something with time.  Ill admit, I didn't really go into the movie with an open mind, but I wound up enjoying it.

Its been three years since we last visited Alice (Mia Wasikowska).  During that time, shes been traveling the world as the captain of her fathers old ship, buying and selling things to bring back to England.  Only when she returns, she learns that her fathers partners son is now in charge.  That man just happens to be Hamish (Leo Bill), the man she embarrassed by publicly turning down when he proposed marriage.

Hamish has not forgiven Alice, and he has concocted a way to get even with her.  While she is still reeling from his plan, she spots Absolem (voiced by Alan Rickman), the caterpillar turned butterfly.  He leads her through a mirror and back to Wonderland.

And shes arrived just in time, too.  It turns out the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) has just seen something that reminds him of his family.  He didn't leave on good terms with them, and then they died before he could make amends.  The reminder is slowly killing him.  The only chance to save him is for Alice to go back in time and save his family.  To do that, she needs the chronosphere, which is carefully guarded by Time himself (Sacha Baron Cohen).  Can Alice go back in time and fix things?  Or will she run out of time?

Those who know the book are already shaking their heads.  This has nothing at all to do with the book of the same name.  Having said that, there is a fun scene near the beginning that winks at a couple of things from book before the adventure really begins.  Of course, almost every movie version of the books combines elements from both to begin with.  For example, Tweedledee and Tweedeldum (Matt Lucas) and the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) are both from Through the Looking Glass and not Alice in Wonderland at all.  So really, you have to take this film on its own merits.

And those merits turn out to be pretty good.  Ive got to say, I actually was surprised by a twist or two along the way.  Not to say the ending is completely original, but it is fun.  The way the moral is layered in is good as well, and it never gets in the way of the story.  In fact, it helps Alice out of a jam or two before everything is said and done.  The ending did feel rushed and that hurt the film, but thats a minor point overall.

And, yes, Helena Bonham Carters Red Queen is back again as well.  Shes not quite as over the top this time around, and I actually liked her character better here as a result.  In fact, the original actors or voice actors are all back, and they do a fantastic job again.  Meanwhile, the new cast members fit perfectly into this wacky world.

Special effects are king here as they were the first time around, and you can tell how much better theyve gotten in the past 6 years.  I had a hard time with some effects early on in the movie, but as it went along, I had an easier time believing what I was seeing.  Or maybe it was because I got caught up in the story.

So forget everything you think you know about the book when you go to see this film.  Yes, its a sequel, but it turns out that Alice Through the Looking Glass is a sequel worth watching.",1464307200,4,3638,4.284875183553598

2236581,5,B0007R6Y06,"The trailer promises classic Burton imagery, both dramatic and intense, but also humorous. The cinematography and atmosphere is fantastically dark and Gothic with elements of Steampunk. For a Disney film Alice Through the Looking Glass looks scary. It appears to be a homage to Lewis Carroll using his characters as an inspiration rather than attempting to create an adaption of the original story. The cast is decked out with familiar faces who look delightfully outlandish and this is likely to make for marvellous viewing for both adults, younger views and fans of Gothic Fantasy.",1464220800,3,583,5.212765957446808

2236583,1,B0007R6Y06,Don't know to whom this would appeal. Fine actors wasted on this attempt to breathe new life into a wonderful Victorian Era story.

Alice doesnt really go to wonder land
Shes just crazy and only sees the real world differently, which must be weird to everyone else watching her. The time guardian is also a joke, doesnt take hes job seriously, cant change time or you else you turn to stone? Wrong, thats not how it works, a paradox? Yes.

2236603,5,B0007R6Y06,"I think it wasn't the same story as in the book, of course I read the book about 32 years ago. It was an interesting tale and made you understand why the characters ended up the way they did. Anything is better with Helena Bonham Carter in it, so I loved the movie. Alice travels through time to save the Hatter and in doing so she discovers what happened to the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter. She wasn't able to change everything, but Alice was able to effect many changes during the  course of the movie. The movie did make me not like the white queen, but I think that was supposed to happen. I ended up liking the Red Queen, which shows everyone is not all good or bad. Sometimes good people do bad things which change other people's lives for the worse and they never pay for that... who knows what moral if any this movie was trying to convey, but it was fun.",1516147200,,864,4.173652694610778

2236667,5,B0007R6Y06,"Better than the first. I would say it has a more interesting and adult story-line. The first 'Alice' was visually flat-out-fun to see but, I found the acting a bit lacking (with a few exceptions of course!) The new character ""Time"" is much more interesting to watch than the Crispin Glover role in the original. Depp's role is also not quite so cartoonish in this one, better I think. The White Queen does not shine like she did in the first one (loved her in that!) Helena Carter ""Red Queen"" is still there, but her role just lacks the luster of the original movie. You'll find a lot of the old characters just have cameo appearances, but that does not take away from the movie! It is well done and entertaining!
PS. No cutting off of heads in this one, so safe for kids to see. However, I don't think they'ed like it anyway. As I said, a more adult story-line.",1504828800,,862,4.3602484472049685

2236693,3,B0007R6Y06,"Excellent costumes, Time offers some good moments for comic relief, the protagonist continues to be interesting. The main problem of this movie is the weak plot. Hatter seems to be on the blues because he doesn't know what happened to his family and apparently Alice has to jump the shark (almost literally) to somehow find out what happened to his family and rescue them before Hatter uhh... um... becomes boring?

This is the biggest problem of this movie: the consequences of Hatter becomming a dull person is just not urgent enough to take the trouble of bringing Alice back to this magical world and make her rush around in circles and doing a lot of stuff without anyone helping her. The other characters just sort of sit on a table drinking tea with dandy faces and don't really do much. The White Queen has a few moments of quirkiness but she too is sort of just standing there. The Red Queen has some nice backstory but her so called prison/exile sub plot seems sort of weak. And then the scene where Alice ends up in a psychiatric hospital halfway into the film sort of seems out of place and damages the already disjointed pacing of the film.

Disney forked good cash on the visuals, but even then, relying on so much CGI that the movie ends up looking like plastic removes the fantasy and yearn for escapism from the viewer. The movie has some good moments here and there, but I can see why it was a bit of a flop at the theaters. Might be worth it if you really enjoyed the first film, but otherwise it isn't a film that you *must* see.",1498262400,,1549,4.431578947368421

2236726,4,B0007R6Y06,"Not as dark and twisted and original as the first one. But tim burton is like that. The only new chaictor is forced. The origional wowed with the introduction of each character. Def more of a children's movie. Not one of johnny depps better films. Usually his characters have a bit of darkness and mystery to them. The hatter has less and becomes a less powerful and less sophisticated character. It seems a major subplot to explain the character's development to become the freaks that they now are. Time was just weak. I think no knowing and having the story simply about alice and her experiences worked better. If life, things are often not explained or neatly wrapped up for delivery by UPS.
  OTOH, make sure you see the HD, not the SD. It was visually stunning and kept my eye on the screen the full time. I tend to drift and read e-mails when I'm watching a video, Not this time. It was still very entertaining.",1495843200,,919,4.497005988023952

Once again, while not incredible 'Alice Through The Looking Glass gave me a fun story with great moments, entertaining characters and surprisingly a lot of heartfelt back stories.

This sequel picks up right where it left off giving us a strong and independent version of Alice with tight bonds of friendship to all her compatriots in Wonderland. Sacha Barron Cohen is fantastic as Time especially, when he plays off of The Mad Hatter and his nutty crew. You get some interesting insight into the past of both the Queens and Hatter and those backstories give you a very interesting perspective on how they came to be. Those stories will definitely put a few things on their own heads.

Once again, a fun tale of silliness and an entertaining follow up to a crafty re-envisioning.",1492646400,2,919,4.597560975609756

2236811,4,B0007R6Y06,"From watching the first Tim Burton Alice In Wonderland, I actually prefer this sequel than it's predecessor. The reason being, is mainly because of it's more mature theme throughout and getting to know the backgrounds of the characters more well through the time travel aspect. The acting is significantly better than the first, and the ending is done well with great closure of all the characters in Wonderland and out. BUT, there is one plot-hole I noticed in the beginning that i'm sure everyone will understand too. The plot-hole being how The Red Queen was handcuffed to Stayne the Knave of Hearts at the end of the first film, and how in this one it is as if he never existed hence never knew what happened to him yet The Red Queen is perfectly fine when she meets up with the character Time. Maybe he killed himself? Or resides in her new domain? No one knows unfortunately.

It is a shame however, that this film did not get such good reviews and response from the box office. I personally think that Alice in Wonderland (the first film) should have been done more differently to what everyone else was expecting (how Alice first goes into Wonderland and we know the whole story). I did find it interesting though, how she was 18 and going back to Wonderland, but I think after the first film, everyone got tired of it and decided to call it a day. I actually like Tim Burton's style of directing and animation but I prefer his older films rather than his newer ones.

The ending of the film (SPOILER ALERT) could have been done better. I find it amusing that Hamich get's his at the end when Alice comes back to the real world but I find that they should have done something much more insulting but I get that this is a children's film (kind of not really). What is really strange is that Alice is a captain of a ship...? This was obviously done as filler content but I find it highly unlikely that she would do this, even at the end of the first film. What I also didn't expect is for her to chop off her hair either. The story is definitely not what the original book was and it was twisted to entertain new audiences but I still feel inclined to say that they shouldn't have done this and that they should have stuck to the original plot not to confuse others who have actually read the book.

Overall I give this a 4/5 stars.",1488499200,,2338,4.394919168591224

As thoroughly awful as Tim Burton's 2010 Alice in Wonderland was -- and it definitely was -- this ill-conceived hash of a sequel is even more of a travesty and an insult. Yes yes, the effects are fine. The acting's not terrible. But the writing is abysmal. It doesn't play out like it had a coherent script at all -- more like Disney execs scooped up a bunch of pages cut from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, pasted them into a notebook with some pages left out of Burton's film, and called it a day. It has ab-so-effing-lutely nothing to do with the Alice stories, except to borrow an odd lot of the characters and then put them through very un-characteristic gyrations. All the crap that was added, including long passages of exposition that wouldn't have been necessary if there'd been an actual script, just adds to the awfulness.

2236932,4,B0007R6Y06,"I'll have to admit, I haven't bought the DVD or Blu-Ray or whatever, but we did stream it and watch it that way. It's cute! :D I kind of despaired of it, I know how Tim treats others' stories (usually badly, except for maybe /Sleepy Hollow/, which is such an old story that I don't think Washington Irving would mind [and he might like it better than the Disney cartoon version]). His own stuff, his original stuff, is wonderful, and even though he was ""only"" one of the producers on this one, I think he definitely put his stamp and flavor on it/in it. My husband, a dyed-in-the-wool Lewis Carroll fan and English major, recognized just about every reference they had in there, winced properly at all the puns, and had seen it first and wanted to show it to me.

Well, he convinced me! It is cute; it's not gonna win any Oscars for Best Picture, but it was cute. I could've used some subtitles or English for the Hearing Impaired for some of the rapid-patter British-accented bits, especially the quiet ones, but I enjoyed it...enough to the point that now I think I'll give the first one a gander. ;->

Well done (and well done on the Top 40 song at the end, which I usually often despair of as well [Disney's track record on those is frequently atrocious], but Pink nailed it! I'll have to see about a CD that's on...)! :)",1484697600,,1325,4.404081632653061

2237005,2,B0007R6Y06,"What a disappointment!  The first Alice In Wonderland, directed by Tim Burton, was amazing.  So, we figured this one would be amazing too.  Uh, Tim Burton didn't direct this one, he was just one of the producers.  Someone named James Bobin directed this one.  It was sappy, the production was terrible, and whoever wrote the script must have been partially brain dead.  It was not a Tim Burton film, it was a typical Disney piece of yuck.  The first film was exciting, wonderfully directed, the type of movie you want to watch over and over again.  This one, we kept facepalming throughout the movie.  It was sooo predictable.  We were able to tell each other what was going to happen next, it was so Disneyfied.  Now, the casting was wonderful.  But they were given such a terrible script that even though all of them were wonderful actors, and tried their hardest to work with the script they had, it was still terrible.  We feel sorry for the actors who had to endure doing such a bad movie after doing the one directed by Tim Burton.  And what the......?  It was a partial Steampunk movie, and though I love Steampunk, it didn't work with this movie.",1483920000,,1154,4.560975609756097

Johnny Depp is ""spot on"" with injecting the right amount ""character."" Only regret is I wish we'd have seen it in 3D in the theaters.",1483833600,,449,4.421686746987952

2237160,3,B0007R6Y06,"First let me state that while I have a familiarity with Alices Adventures in Wonderland, Im not with this sequel by Lewis Carroll so I cant determine how close the movie is to the source material.  The movie starts off with a bang.  An impressive opening scene has Alice (Mia Wasikowska) as a sea captain trying to outrun a handful of pirates through a treacherous storm and even more menacing jagged rocks in front of her.  She artfully pulls her crew together and personally climbs a mast to release a stuck sail.  We see early on that Alice has grown into an excellent sailor and leader of men.

Once she reaches port with her cargo intact, Alice is quickly relieved of her command by the son of the shipping owner who has recently died.  The son, Hamish (Leo Bill) is still upset that Alice refused his marriage offer.  He also bought up the mortgage that Alices mother (Lindsay Duncan) had on her home.  Hamish offers Alice a clerical job but wants her to sell him her share of the ship which belonged to her late father.  If she refuses, Hamish will foreclose on moms homestead.  Alice avoids the decision by running into a room which just happens to have a large mirror that leads straight to the Underland.  Evidently decisions at sea are easier than domestic choices so in she goes.

Surprised to see Alice, the usual group of old friends confronts her advising that the Hatter, Tarrant Hightopp (Johnny Depp) has gone mad and is danger of dying.  Why you say?  Hes evidently discovered that his thought to be dead family may still be alive.  No one really believes him, not even Alice.  But with guidance from princess (or queen  not sure) Mirana (Anne Hathaway), Alice decides to confront Time (Sacha Baron Cohen) in order to procure a Chronosphere which is a time travelling machine.  Time isn't helpful but Alice somehow acquires the machine and were off to the races back in time.

Its much too complicated and in fact, impossible to explain how exactly the contraption works.  Even the screenwriters seem confused.  So don't spend a lot of time focusing on logic, normal transitions or sound movie editing.  None of that is here.  Hopefully, if you are watching this movie with your kids  and there really is no other reason to do so  they and you will be enamored with the excellent colorful CGI magic.  Make no mistake this movie looks and sounds great.  Interestingly, even with the bombastic special effects, there is a routine scene of Alice, Mirana and others galloping on horseback.  A close-up of Mirana is so poorly done, you could almost see the stage horse shes sitting on.

Another problem with the film is the overblown characters portrayed by Depp and Helena Bonham Carter as the big headed Iracebeth, Miranas sister.  Hathaway herself seems to be on set against her will.  Wasikowska is fine as Alice although the filmmakers did her character no service showing her as weak and indecisive when dealing with Hamish and the ship owners.  Cohen is interesting as Time, but again his scenes could have been better written.  The only reason to watch this James Bobin (Muppets Most Wanted) directed mess is for the WOW, colorful special effects.  For kiddies only.",1482105600,,3188,4.725952813067151

2237168,1,B0007R6Y06,"Re: Alice Through the Looking Glass (2016 Disney Adaptation (Spoilers)):
I would like to say that after being familiar with the first adaptation from Disney (by this I mean the first one directed by Tim Burton, not the 1951 animated classic) I went into this with an open mind, not expecting it to be too strictly tied into Carroll's actual book. After all, they were very loose with the first film. However, the first one was at least based in bits and pieces on plot points from both books - falling down the rabbit hole, the insanity of the queen, the poem slaying the Jabberwocky. But I'm not here to review that film. That would be a separate post. I digress.
If you're looking for a movie that is even loosely based on the work by Lewis Carroll, you're going to be quite disappointed. While it is more story driven than the first film - this one is not directed by Tim Burton (who is more concerned with visuals than story according to Mia Wasikowska, who plays Alice) it isn't a very strong story. Instead of being based on Alice, the white pawn, going across the chess board, it is based on the premise of Alice saving the family of the Mad Hatter who apparently died in some attack from the Jabberwocky, a villain from the first film and the second book. Mostly, the two films are tied together on location (Wonderland) and characters (taken from both the first and the second book, as most film adaptations of Wonderland are.) The Hatter's family's death isn't thoroughly explored, but in a way that makes some sense, as the hatter is, after all, mad.
Time is turned into a character in this film. He's referenced in the first book with the famous mad tea party scene, where they explain that it is always tea time because the Mad Hatter sang a song and the Queen of Hearts said ""You're murdering the time!"" He was never a real character in either book, though. In this film, he's made into... not exactly a bad guy, but something like Hades in Greek mythology - not a bad person, just doing his job, even when it's unpleasant. However, his character does not have complexity. It reminds me of the third installment of The Santa Claus movies with Tim Allen where they made Jack Frost the villain because they simply needed a villain. Through the Looking Glass as a book doesn't have a villain, and benefits from that; it wasn't necessary for the story's progression for Alice to have an adversary in either book. In both films now, an adversary has been added, to try and add drama for the silver screen. An added villain not present in the second book is the addition of the Queen of Hearts, as a lover of Time. So essentially, this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Lewis Carroll's classic book, except that it took some character names from it - at this point, I won't even say it took characters, because that would imply that the characters in the film were at all similar to their literary counter parts. I'm writing this before the film has even really had a conflict or climax, because I don't think there will be one. I do plan to finish the movie though.
On some positive notes: I will say that this film does do a very good job of staying within its own universe. The characters are not Carroll characters, but they are consistent. The visuals are - good at some points, lacking in others, honestly. The actors are excellent, even if the script is not. It is probably entertaining to children. Probably. Maybe. I'm not sure. I don't have any children to show it to.
That noted - I did finish the movie, this is the second part of the review.
This became straight up cringe worthy. The plot makes sense, but is horribly constructed and full of holes. Everything is coming at you so fast that you don't have any time to attach to any characters, or really appreciate any plot developments - like when the Hatter's family is found, you just don't really care as an audience member. Everything is far too convenient and wraps up with a nice little bow because that's what Disney does... regardless of if it makes sense, especially with these movies. At one point they even bring in young versions of the characters - which for the Hatter, makes sense, but for literally everyone else it just feels incredibly cheesy. Then at the end, in the real world, Alice's mother goes with her on a ship - that makes absolutely no sense. Her character has no consistency. The entire thing was... not in any way an adaptation of Carroll's work. I wish it had been. Then it would have had good writing and clever characters, instead of this Hallmark nonsense. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1481932800,3,4612,4.531175059952038

Depp is a brilliant actor but he's been leaning on a handful of over the top select few crazy parts - Captain Sparrow is one and Mad Hatter is another. Interesting to see the backstories but not really captivated by them. Only one who was truly interesting was Sacha Baron Cohen as Time. There have been many roles I have not liked him in but he is the adult in this one, providing some much needed profundity in a plot which is supposed to deal with past mistakes, second chances and the inevitability of time itself.",1481932800,,693,4.464566929133858

I don't understand why Johnny Depp was titled on having the leading role when it appeared that
Mia Wasikowska had the lead role (sexism in Hollywood).
Perhaps all the real life events had an overall influence on the film and as a result lost a lot of its muchness.

Ian Holm delivers this insane dialogue in such a subdued, sincere way as if the crazy things he's saying somehow make sense. It kind of reminds me of someone with Alzheimer's (this is a sad way to think about it but that's what it reminded me of.) So I think they went a good direction with it instead of everyone acting super goofy. It's very British so some may have a hard time understanding what they are saying sometimes. The special effects aren't the greatest since this is pretty old and seems like it may have been a made for tv production.

2237235,5,B0007R6Y06,"I was so surprised by the negative reviews and the fact that this movie did not perform well. Regardless of what the critics had to say, I thought it was excellent. I loved the first Alice too, and have watched it like a gazillion times--I practically know it by heart. This sequel I've only seen in the theater once, so it doesn't have that same ""I can recite every line"" quality (yet!), but visually, it is even more stunning than the first movie. The sequences in Time's domain, with it's gloriously steampunky aura, are absolutely breathtaking. And Alice's voyage's on the Seas of Time are so visually arresting that you'll wish you were right there in that Chronosphere with her.
What also made this film so very appealing was the fact that ALL the characters from the old film were back(watch closely, and you can even catch a glimpse of Stain!). It really made it seem like the cast was all in, and gave the film a wonderful continuity. Mia Wasikowska is the ultimate Alice, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonam Carter were convincing in their emotionally expanded storyline, Sasha Baron Cohen gave an interestingly nuanced performance, and Johnny Depp can do no wrong. Only one bittersweet observation on the cast is that if the creative forces behind the film had only known what was to come, they might have enlarged Absolem's part, and given a more extensive showcase to the legendary Alan Rickman's final performance.
In addition to all of this, the story was excellent too, and touched on some genuinely relevant issues. Seeing the origin story of how the animosity began between the Red and White queens was a stroke of storytelling genius, and the lessons that Alice learns about the complexities of Time are (pardon the pun) timeless. Overall, an excellent movie that got an undeservedly bad rap because success or failure of movies these days is judged not by the quality of the filmmaking, but by the size of the box office receipts.
In my opinion, a beautifully done sequel, one I can't wait to watch again at home.",1481328000,,2028,4.764204545454546

2237317,4,B0007R6Y06,"I liked it! It was a nice sequel, and it was already done in book form. I think they all did a wonderful job on it. Mia is a great actress and so is the rest of the cast. The visuals were superb!! In 4K it looks stunning. The storyline is that of the Mad Hatter. He is not himself, depressed and slowly dying. His family is missing and presumed deceased. So, Alice is sought after to help. That is basic premises behind the sequel.
Usually, sequels don't do as well as the first, but I already loved the first one, so I usually give the sequel a benefit of the doubt.
 I found it enjoyable to watch, a bit more complex than its previous companion, thus, kids probably won't have the ""attention span"" to keep interest.
Just my thought on that. This movie also lets us see what it is that had the two sisters, the Queens, practically hating each other. Now, we know the real reason for it.
I thought the Special Features were outstanding as well. The actresses and Mr. Depp did a great job on talking about the making of it all and looks like they had a good time on it also. For those that can't seem to find the Special or Bonus Features on the disc, well, you need to select the menu and use your arrow keys on the remote. They are there, trust me on that. I watched them all.

If you like a bit more complex sequel than it's predecessor, you may like this movie. I thought it was well done and I have at least 500 Blurays and DVDS in my library at home. Complex dramas, horrors, comedies, documentaries.
Great audio and languages as well as superb visuals make this at least a 4 Star movie for me.",1480809600,2,1599,4.188311688311688

So here everyone is back to just resolve family issues. Alice with her controlling mom, the Red Queen with her sister and Hatter with his father. Sacha Baron Cohen joins the cast as Time where all his lines are Time related as he talks like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
I like time travel movies so I enjoyed the time travel aspect of the plot. The visuals are all nice during those scenes. However since the first pretty much already felt like a follow up to Alice in Wonderland. This film never gives too much of a reason to why it exists. Other than for more money.

I love the whole time thing, and I enjoyed the different versions of the characters.  It is starting to be visible that time is finally catching up with Johnny Depp even with the makeup but I would still do him.

2237421,4,B0007R6Y06,I was concerned about watching a sequel to a movie.  Normally they are not as good as the first one.  This movie proved to be just as good as the original.  The storyline involves a theme of time travel that I enjoyed because of my love of Doctor Who.  The writers of the script used many small details of the Lewis Carroll story to bring out full story plots and subplots which you learn about in the bonus features.  Worth the price and the time to watch.,1479168000,2,457,4.206896551724138

2237460,5,B0007R6Y06,The only possible reasons I can imagine for any poor reviews on this movie would be the lack of addressing material from the books not covered in the first movie ...like the walrus & the Carpenter & of course Oysters.  This may have deliberately been left out due to the possible religious innuendo's brought up in colleges.  Other than that this is great escapist fantasy picking up where the original movie left off.  This movie is visually stunning the acting is fine & it is fast paced.  As far as character development that was accomplished in the first movie allowing the new movie to fly into action.  It even allows us to have a little compassion for the villainous Red Queen by touching on the past.  It even manages to cover the complex issues of time travel better than many other more serious science fiction movies with some hilarious puns.  Critics missed the boat by being hard on this movie after all its just a movie...it was never intended to change the world just made to have some fun & in that I feel it was a success!!!,1479081600,4,1041,4.50531914893617
2237461,2,B0007R6Y06,It had a great story but the picture quality was just horrible. We watched the first time and thought maybe our internet or tv wasn't showing the movie right. But then I watched it on my laptop real early in the morning when everybody was still asleep and the quality was still terrible and the movie was rebuffering a couple of times. I wouldn't rent our buy this movie. It just looked too pixel and blurry and we didn't get the 3d version.,1479081600,,441,4.325301204819277

I loved Johnny Depp's portrayal of the Mad Hatter, as he adds a layer of emotion that is not present in the classic tales, most evidently his sadness. Alice is well done, and I love the feminist spin on the story, and her tenaciousness. The filmography was beautiful, and the Red Queen performance was hilarious. Over all the story was interesting, the picture quality was amazing, and the performances were all four stars, including Sasha Baron Cohen. I would recommend this, and dropped one star simply because it was not as good as the first movie.",1478908800,,622,4.715596330275229

  While this film seemed rather rushed and missing a bit here and there, over all, its a great film as most of Disney films are, itd be great to see more of this series, if there are any additional literature works, idk, but heres to hoping, so glad to have purchased this and Alice in Wonderland.

This DVD features more adventures into Wonderland with those silly characters plus some new friends. It is a amazing to think of how much work went into creating everything in the world and even parts of characters. My kids and I were in awe of the movie and we ended up watching it twice in a row! Even if you are not an Alice in Wonderland fan, it is still a great movie packed with fun. It is impossible not to smile and laugh throughout the whimsical, silly movie but don't think its all fun and games either - there are adventures and mischief as well.  You also can watch this movie without the first but it does help to give you an idea of how the movie starts out and the background of the characters.",1478131200,,833,4.079268292682927

Alice must travel back in time to certain time periods to try to save Hatters family from a grisly death and disappearing out of Hatters life. Unfortunately, Alice is pursued by Time the being that controls and manages time itself. As Alice travels backwards time itself is being disrupted and destroyed bit by bit until time is gone.

However, when I sat down and begin to watch, I was pleasantly delighted at just how good a film this is. True, it has little to do with anything Lewis Carroll wrote, but it stands on it's own as a good story featuring the characters we've all come to know and love.

""Through the Looking Glass"" serves as a prequel of sorts, at Alice must travel through time to try and find out what happened to the Mad Hatter's family. As she does, she meets and discovers the Wonderland gang when they were young, and how their lives began and why they turned out the way they did.

There is a new character in Time, as played by Sacha Baron Cohen, and he is simply wonderful. One of my favorite scenes is when Time visits the Mad Hatter's tea party.

Go ahead and give it a try, you'll be surprised at just how good it is.",1477699200,,954,4.202185792349726

2237889,3,B0007R6Y06,"This is a different reimagining of the original story and sort of a sequel to the Alice in Wonderland movie a few years ago.  Although I don't think this is as great of a movie as it could have been, I don't think it is as bad as others have said.  As with most Disney movies, there are tons of cool special effects and CGI here that are well done.  Depp who plays quirky characters well, I think is good as the Hatter but seems to be toned down a bit from the previous Alice movie.  To me, Sasha Cohen, who is also known for playing unique characters, is fantastic as Time.  Cohen creates a character that is both funny and likeable.  I also think Helen Bonham Carter is good in her quirky roles as well.  The only disappointment to me in their role was Hathaways portrayal of Mirana, which was more annoying than anything else.

Although I found the movie entertaining and fun as there is plenty of action throughout, the story and overall plot felt a bit thin and I think could have been better written.  It felt like the story was missing something to me that could have made it better.

2237910,3,B0007R6Y06,"Alice Through the Looking Glass is a follow-up to Tim Burtons 2010 Alice In Wonderland. Rather than go directly back to the Lewis Carroll source material, screenwriter Linda Wolverton has combined some of Carrolls best-known characters with a plot about a son trying to reconnect with his family, a bit of science-fiction time travel, and eye-filling visuals made possible through the magic of computer-generated imagery.

As the film opens, Alice (Mia Wasikowska) is literally captain of her own ship, just returning from a long voyage. She prides herself on her independence in 19th-century England, which was none too accepting of imaginative, intelligent, self-sufficient young women. Her jilted suitor, Hamish (Leo Bill), is putting financial pressure on her mother (Lindsay Duncan), threatening to take over Alices ship or her mothers house.

Before long, Alice passes through a huge mirror back into Wonderland, where she learns that the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) is nuttier than ever, thinking that his family is still alive even though everyone else believes they were killed long ago by the evil Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter). To help her old friend, Alice visits Time (personified by Sacha Baron Cohen) to get hold of the Chronosphere, a gold ball that turns into a time machine, and cross the Ocean of Time to go back and alter the course of events.

While planning this journey, she is reunited with White Queen Mirana (Anne Hathaway), who harbors a dark secret. She also encounters Tweedledum and Tweedledee (Matt Lucas), the Cheshire Cat, Humpty Dumpty, and the Dormouse, but they are on hand more as a nod to Carroll than as plot ingredients. The CGI work with Tweedledum and Tweedledee is exceptionally good, but they are given so little to do that the effort is wasted. Their dialogue, intended to be amusing, falls flat and they just sort of hang around while the manic Alice races though time.

Ms. Wasikowska makes a rather dull Alice even though the character is scripted to be bright, forward-thinking, courageous, and able to handle herself well in both the reality of 1875 London and the fantastical world behind the looking glass. This is yet another attempt to give a well-known Victorian-era literary character a feminist sensibility. Theres nothing wrong with that per se, but the screenplay should justify it. This Alice is driven more by emotion than by logic, undermining the characters reformulation.

The brightest moments are provided by Mr. Cohen, who specializes in broadly drawn characters. His Time takes his job seriously, of course, which often results in embarrassing lapses and silly outbursts. Here, too, however, Cohens talents are not fully exploited by a script surprisingly devoid of whimsy.

Ms. Bonham Carters Red Queen, with bobble-sized head and heart- shaped lips, is a wonderfully quirky creation, and her biting comments are delivered with just the right intonation to elicit chuckles.

There are wrong-headed choices, such as mechanical enemies of Alice that look like Transformers. Is this a half-hearted attempt to engage young male viewers?

Though briskly paced and less than two hours, the movie feels endless because the characters aren't engaging enough for the viewer to care. Director James Bobin often makes even chases seem dull.

For a movie geared to young viewers, Alice Through the Looking Glass has too many storylines going on at the same time. The visuals never let up, so if you're on board for being dazzled continuously by the latest achievements in special effects, you will not be disappointed. But if you demand that such sequences serve the story, you will be let down. Viewed in IMAX 3D, the movie does look and sound spectacular. But the experience is akin to reaching for that huge, magnificently wrapped package with the glorious red bow beneath the Christmas tree only to find a pair of socks inside. Alice Through the Looking Glass is glitter and pizazz with a hollow core.

Rated PG-13, Alice Through the Looking Glass is a catalog of the latest special effects encased in three different stories that eventually come together. Despite its lush costumes and production design, the picture is unsatisfying. Short on laughs, or even a clever quip or two, the movie is bloated. Wheres Lewis Carroll when you really need him?

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include a making-of featurette, behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the costumes, whimsical interview with Sacha Baron Cohen reflecting on his friendship with author Lewis Carroll, profiles of the films unusual supporting characters, side-by-side comparisons of raw production footage with the completed movie, and the music video Just Like Fire by Pink. A digital HD copy is enclosed. The film is also available as a double-bill Blu-ray release with Tim Burtons Alice In Wonderland.",1476835200,4,4845,5.151399491094147

We loved how parts of this movie tied into sections of the first AIW. Setting up the ever-lasting tea party; Hatter finding the fabric in the burned town; the white & red queen's history of how their relationship came about. Although some things make more sense if you have seen Burton's AIW, Through the Looking Glass can stand on it's own also.

The bonus features were great - interviews, the making of costumes, the making of Pink's song & video.

And as expected it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie with nice special effects throughout the movie. You need to watch this movie through a kid's perspective, don't try to find much reality in the story. Nothing to complain about the acting of Mia Wasikoaska as Alice, she gets right into the character from the beginning. Johnny Depp is awesome as usual as Hatter Hightopp. The story revolves round Hatter as the mission of Alice was to save Hatter's family going back in time. How Alice overcome lots of handles in her mission and fight against time himself is nice to watch. And most importantly at the end of the movie there is a nice message to take back from the movie.

At the risk of opening myself to criticism, I have to wonder here if part of the dislike is how many of the primary characters are female and/or animated animals.  If one is going to make a movie inspired by Lewis Carroll's Alice Through the Looking Glass, then this is what to expect: women and talking animals.  As is appropriate for a space that is hard to define - dreamscape? alternate reality? acid trip? - some of the characters are more of archetypes than three dimensional and complex creatures/people.  As far as I'm concerned, that's OK, and very much in the spirit of the original stories.

The colors are gaudy, almost hyper-real, the music is great (<3 P!nk!), and the action just keeps coming. Definitely worth watching, especially if you have an impressionable young kid who could benefit from reminding that women can make their own destiny, and being a princess is neither most desirable nor relevant.",1474156800,2,1042,4.761111111111111

If anyone could capture the giddy world of Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dum, Chesire Cat must have been grinning sheepishly on my theatre seat, as the visual effects carried all the weight.
Despite this disappointing experience, the trailer, once again, for ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" coupled with Pink's near perfect rendition of ""White Rabbit"" would be the armor to protect me from any further schadenfreude. It was further bolstered by a little better audience and critics' reviews.
I'm happy to report that ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" was everything ""Alice in Wonderland"" should have been and truly delivered. Immediately, the eyes were treated to an adventure of what life is like on the other side. (But wait Mr. Burton truly knows how to entertain adults and their young-ups). The adventures begin instantly and doesn't stop until the conclusion.
You probably guessed that I particularly liked Twiddle Dee and Twiddle Dum, Chesire Cat in his lascivious feline movements slithering all about. Less exciting again is the usual ""cannot miss"", Ms. Helena Bonham Carter-Burton, the also usually hilarious Father Time.

I've never read the books but from what I've heard, the book is nothing like this movie so to those of you who have read the book, a little heads up. Disney has put silliness into this franchise which is expected when you go to see this film if you've seen the first one, its not too deep and shouldn't be over analyzed, just enjoyed.  It has a lot of funny lines and new characters like TIME (acted by Sacha Baron Cohen), and great backstories of all the returning characters through lots of time traveling done by Alice (we see how the Queen of Hearts ended up how she did and how the Mad Hatter became a Hatter). Very young children may not follow the movie very much, I would say 7 years and older depending on what your child enjoys to watch. Great for adults as well, between the BEAUTIFUL graphics,( they did a really great job with all the scenes and creativity put into this one), and the story itself. It also carries great messages in it for people, like to enjoy the time you have in your life and with friends and family, and go out and try new things in life, never set boundaries or think things are impossible, go out and try even if it doesn't work out. Great overall movie for the family!

MOVIE STORY LINE: So here's a little info about the movie:  Alice has a job back in the real world as a ship Captain where she uses what she has learned in Wonderland, to attempt the impossible in everything she does in life, and from doing so has become a great Captain who has sailed the world. When she returns back from her voyage though, she's faced with a hard decision to give up her life of adventure or her mother will have to give up her home. This is when Wonderland comes calling to Alice and brings her through the Looking Glass back to Wonderland where she finds her friends distraught over the Mad Hatter being depressed and fading away over thinking his family who he lost at the hand of the Queen of Hearts when he was younger, were actually still alive so Alice goes back in time to save his family in order to save the Hatter before its too late.",1470528000,2,2192,4.264423076923077

2237963,1,B0007R6Y06,"Tim Burton and Disney's $1B CGI, 3D-ized Alice in Wonderland arrived at just the right time. In 2010 we were coming off the history-making box office of James Cameron's Avatar, and audiences were fascinated with 3D's potential. Was the film any good? Well, it looked pretty, but was perhaps the worst example of the cold lifelessness of computer animated saturation. Now six years later Disney is cashing in again with Alice Through the Looking Glass, and unfortunately for it, audiences are well aware of its tricks this time.

Resembling nothing that author Lewis Carrol ever wrote; Alice Through the Looking Glass is a nonsensical mish-mash of half-baked ideas. Are we quite sure the Mad Hatter (Johnny Depp) isn't responsible for the screenplay rather than the returning Linda Woolverton? She cooks up a story that seems to do everything in its power to make us hate every single character in Wonderland, most of all Alice (Mia Wasikowska) who can rightfully be called the villain this time around. Of course she's not framed that way. Years have passed and she's been off acting as a sea captain, battling fierce pirates only marginally less terrifying than the crashing waves. When she arrives back on land, the real world intrudes on her sea-faring career path. Society frowns on a young woman in such a dangerous field, and Alice's former fianc Hamish is keen on buying her boat and forcing her into a boring clerk job.

The real world segment has no bite. Carroll was pretty good at weaving such social commentary into his work but here we know it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is when Alice arrives back in Wonderland. It doesn't take Alice long before she does, aided by Absalom, the caterpillar-turned-butterfly voiced by the late great Alan Rickman. Hearing his voice again will stir up emotions in you than the rest of the film won't.

All is not well in Wonderland. The Mad Hatter isn't really mad anymore; he's the Sad Hatter. A found memento reminds him of his dearly departed family, who were all burned to a crisp by the Red Queen (Helena Bonham Carter) and her fiery Jabberwocky.  Okay...so why is this a big deal? Everyone, including the preening White Queen (Anne Hathaway), the White Rabbit (Michael Sheen), Cheshire Cat (Stephen Fry), and Tweedledee and Tweedledum (Matt Lucas), think it's a big deal that the Hatter gets his mojo back. So Alice steals from the master of Time (Sacha Baron Cohen, who may be aping Christoph Waltz) a device that will allow her to travel back in time and fix everything that's gone wrong. The down side? Oh, it threatens to rip the very fabric of existence asunder. Oops, but Mad Hatter really needs to be crazy again. That's more important.

The premise couldn't be more flimsy, and every time Alice tries to explain to Time that destroying all life to save her friend is worthy it comes off as ludicrous. The story can never really escape that, hard as it may try, and kids seeing the film will be taught that selfishness is awesome and everyone should just accept it.  Not sure that's what Woolverton and director James Bobin were going for. The only thing less convincing than Alice's quest is a meager ""revelation"" about the beef between the sibling Red and White Queens. You think they've been tart to one another before now? Trust that it gets much worse. Also, despite being integral to the narrative we don't get to see much of Depp at all. And when we do he just looks like a weirdo with a really bad makeup job. There's little compelling about the Hatter, and certainly not enough to convince us he's worth risking the universe over. Why doesn't someone just slap him and say ""Get over it""?

In taking over for Burton, James Bobin does a decent job of mimicking his predecessor. From a technical standpoint the film is gorgeous, especially Time's mechanized clockwork realm. But unlike Disney's superb The Jungle Book, there's no emotion or life behind all of these green screen landscapes. So we know Disney knows how to pull this sort of thing off; they just haven't been able to do it with their 'Alice' movies yet. If Alice Through the Looking Glass makes a ton of money none of that will matter. But if it doesn't, hopefully they'll spend some precious time making sure they get the next one right, or better yet, stopping the clock on this franchise altogether.",1470182400,4,4348,4.758620689655173
2237974,1,B0007R6Y06,I just went to see this movie and walked out 70 minutes into it. It was AWFUL!!!  I see other reviews where people they liked this movie and all I can say to that is they must have worked on the film or were paid to give it a good review because this movie is AWFUL.,1470096000,3,266,3.75
2237975,1,B0007R6Y06,"One of the biggest problems with Walt Disney's live-action ""Alice in Wonderland"" is that they decided to turn the story into a chosen-one-saves-the-fantasy-kingdom clichefest.

And yet, Disney manages to make the situation even worse in the unasked-for sequel, ""Alice Though The Looking Glass."" It has good CGI and some fascinating new characters -- particularly Sacha Baron Cohen's incarnation of Time itself -- but no amount of canned morals about family and friends can erase the fact that this movie is a trainwreck big enough to take out a station. Not only does it restrict ""Wonderland"" with even more rules, it turns Alice herself from a dead-eyed, bland savior to a dead-eyed, bland supervillain.

After a few years as a sea captain in the Far East, Alice (Wasikowski) returns to England... only to find that her ex-fiancee is conspiring to take away her mother's home if Alice doesn't sign over her ship to him. Alice doesn't care about her mother's potential homelessness, only about not having more adventures. While she's sulking, a butterfly leads her through a massive drawing-room mirror, and back into Underland. After some odd experiences that exist entirely as a homage to the original book, Alice meets up with her friends from the previous movie, and quickly learns that the Hatter (Johnny Depp) has become seriously depressed.

So why is he depressed? He's convinced that his dead family is still alive... somehow... and is now literally dying because Alice won't believe him. I wish I were making that up.

Since everyone inexplicably cares about the Hatter, the White Queen (Anne Hathaway) immediately sends Alice off to plead with Time himself to let her travel back and save his family. A potentially world-ending paradox because a crazy man is sad? Sure, sounds like a reasonable idea. When Time refuses, Alice steals the Chronosphere -- which keeps Time from falling apart -- and goes on a wacky adventure through Underland's past, with the increasingly desperate Time in hot pursuit. Can he stop her and get the Chronosphere back before either she or the Red Queen (Helena Bonham-Carter) destroy all of reality?

""Alice Though the Looking Glass"" is exactly the sequel you'd expect Disney to produce -- since Alice vanquished the bad guys in the previous movie, it has no reason to exist except to (unsuccessfully) rake in more money. So it becomes necessary for Alice to CREATE an apocalyptic problem just so she can get the credit for solving it... which sounds like the kind of thing a supervillain would do. Yes, Alice selfishly decides to endanger an entire UNIVERSE and everyone in it... because of ONE PERSON. Everyone else can apparently just die as far as she's concerned.

And this blinkered approach is what absolutely sinks the movie -- while a family-friendly moral (""appreciate your family and friends or whatever"") is hammered in, the actual movie's message appears to be, ""Everything you do is okay if you're the designated heroine."" Throughout the movie, Wasikowski's Alice is utterly loathsome -- in England she's selfish, bratty and immature, and in Underland she literally endangers all of reality even as Time is literally disintegrating in front of her, but considers Hatter's life worth sacrificing everyone else's. There is not a single reason to cheer for Alice, but we're expected to do so anyway.

Admittedly the movie has luscious CGI and some interesting visuals and ideas, such as a vast sunny, cloudy expanse filled with the stopped pocketwatches of the dead, or the adorable steampunk minions of Time. But this is a movie painfully aware that it has no right or reason to exist. So writer Linda Woolverton and director James Bobin simply fling everything they can at the plot, desperately hoping it will stick -- mainly a tedious subplot about the reason the White and Red Queens hate each other, and the reason Iracebeth is a big-headed child-woman. Don't expect this subplot to actually lead to anything; it simply sputters its way through the final act in a most unsatisfying way.

I will say that Wasikowski has improved since her last outing as Alice, since there are some scenes where she shows some bland, muted emotion, but Alice is so selfish and loathsome that it ultimately amounts to very little. The other actors show little improvement -- Depp's fey, schizophrenic Hatter is as annoying as ever, and I found myself wishing he would hurry up and die. Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham-Carter play the same floaty-handed pallid ingenue and psychotic swollen-skulled child-woman, and the thin subplot about how they fell out is painfully cliched and flat.

The one exception is Sacha Baron Cohen as the incarnation of Time. Not only is Cohen wonderfully sinister, silly and prickly, this guy is the true hero of the movie -- as Alice brings destruction to Underland, this guy is struggling to get the Chronosphere back to save it. He literally seems to be the one and only character who ISN'T supporting the imminent destruction of EVERYTHING.

It's not hard to see why ""Alice Through the Looking Glass"" belly-flopped right out of the starting gate -- it's a pretty but flaccid movie with a heroine who goes from blandly boring to utterly loathsome. The only saving grace is Cohen.",1469923200,10,5249,5.002290950744559
2237976,4,B0007R6Y06,"I don't understand the bad reviews. I really enjoyed this movie. It's a beautifully made and lighthearted movie meant to teach the importance of family and the value of time. Much like the first Alice by Burton the story presented in the movie of what's happening in Wonderland mirrors what Alice is going through in her own life. In the first movie what Alice goes through reminds her in the end that there is more to life for her than becoming a wife and that there is nothing wrong with that. She throws off the common choices of society for women in that era and chooses a path all her own. In this movie Alice realizes the importance of her remaining family, which is her mother, and how she uses time is more precious than she once thought. I thought the CGI was well done and I love the characters. I really enjoyed getting to see some of the back stories on the characters. Seeing them as children was neat.

2237981,5,B0007R6Y06,"I have been to see Alice Through the Looking Glass twice at the movies. Once during a field trip with the third graders from my childrens public school and the second time with my own family.  I can't wait to buy the DVD once it is released. There have been only a handful of movies [inlc. most of Aardman Animations and all of Laikas films] that have created in my children the same enthusiasm as in meadd to this rare list this years Alice Through the Looking Glass! My kids and I have fallen in equal amount of love with Alice Through the Looking Glass! We simply ADORE this beautiful, clever, progressive visual adaptation of Carol Lewis sequel to Alices Adventures in Wonderland.  The first time I watched this movie was during a matine at AMC Loews 84th Street 6 with hundreds of NYC public school children cheering and clapping enthusiastically for Alice and the Mad Hatter. Film reviewers ought to watch family movies with these kids for the sake of enlightenment. In Alice Through the Looking Glass, Johnny Depps Mad Hatter is the sweetest, gentlest, most original man to grace the silver screen in recent years. We LOVE his sweet lisp: my fammelli, his kind, caring, bold heart and his beautiful friendship with Alice and the wonderland creatures. I still marvel at Johnny Depps choice to give up the lure of being a pretty Hollywood mannequin for the sake of playing far riskier, playful, dark comedic roles. His work with Tim Burton is the stuff of legends. Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen is flawless, her every facial expression priceless, plus it is so good to see her character redeemed (blame her stingy mother!). Mia Wasikowska in the role of Alice is a breath of fresh air, a wonderful role model and guiding light for young girls and actresses the world over. Her aspirations not to mention her gorgeous wardrobe as Alice is to die for. Anne Hathaway is cleverly self-deprecating as the White Queen. There is a lot of great acting and world-class voice talent (Alan Rickman, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen, Timothy Spall, and Barbara Windsor among others) representing the best of British comedy in Alice through the Looking Glass. The brilliant Welsh comedian Rhys Ifans in the role of Zanik Hightopp, the Mad Hatters father reminds me of Lionel Jeffries who played the father of Dick van Dykes character Caractacus Potts in the 1968 film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Like Lionel Jeffries, Rhys Ifans too is younger than his on-screen son Johnny Depp. Leo Bill as Hamish is a younger, dorkier David Tomlinson as George Banks in the 1964 Mary Poppins film. Last but not least the British funnyman Matt Lucas dialogues as Tweedledum and Tweedledee with Alice are unforgettable:

Alice: Whats the matter?

White Rabbit: The Hatters the matter.

Tweedledee: Or the matter of the Hatter.

Tweedledum: The former.

Tweedledee: No, the latter.

Tweedledee: [in unison with Tweedledum] Hes mad.

Alice: The Hatter?

[the Tweedles nod]

Alice: Yes, I knowThats his muchness. Thats what makes him so him.

Tweedledee: But hes grown darker. Less dafter.

Tweedledum: Denies himself laughter.

Sacha Baron Cohen as Time shows he can be funny without his jokes being on millions of Arabs and Muslims. Yet it seems that he still needs to ethnicize his characters. In the role of Time, he sports a post-WWII villainous German accent in scenes where Time is machine-like (read authoritarian) and switches to his notorious South London Pakistani Ali G accent when Time appears idiotic. Like in following scene when the joke is on Time:

Mad Hatter: [to Time] Is it true that you heal all wounds?

March Hare: [sits next to Time and elbows him] Time is on my side!

Mad Hatter: Why is it that you wait for no man?

Mallymkun: [covers one eye] I just cant find the time!

Mallymkun: Cheshire! Where have you been? Youre late.

Cheshire Cat: [lands on Times shoulders] Actually, Im right on time.

Mad Hatter: [grabs Times hand] I have time on my hand!

Time: [in an Ali G. accent] You silly nitwits really think that Ive not heard these cheap jabs before? Your attempts at mockery fall flat.

Mad Hatter: [plays with Times shoulder pads] Look! Time is flying!

Time: [stands up furiously] Enough! No more wasting me!

Mad Hatter: [nervously] Im having the time of my life?

It remains to be seen if Mr. Baron Cohen can stay in the game without being a pathological racist, although judging from his current Facebook profile picture, where his 4 million fans see him grinning in a plain white Arab keffiyeh and dishdasha standing next to an unsuspecting Saudi-looking man, I doubt this very much.

The greatest credit for this beautiful film, dedicated to the brilliant late Alan Rickman (voice of Absolem) has got to go the heroic script-writer Linda Woolverton and producer Tim Burton the Magnificent, the author of so many of our dreams.

However, for ATLG instead of a writing they just smear their excrement on the page. I don't know what offended me more the terrible flow, the massive plot holes or the ridiculously overly-chauvinistic/elitest and unlikeable antagonists.

Speaking of caricatures, the acting was awful too.

Not sure who/what Anne Hathaway was channeling, but she couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted to act stoned or mildly retarded. She's a decent actor so I can only assume she was on bath salts the entire time.

Sacha Cohen. He gets a pass for Ali G and a few of his other movies, so I'm willing to assume not even he could polish this turd of a script.

Johnny Depp wears a ton of makeup and acts weird, big surprise. At this point I think all his roles are just variations of his actual personality, with the amount of makeup determining where on the crazy scale he plays.

Alice. I can't be bothered to look up her name as she clearly couldn't be bothered to act. With the budget they had for CGI they could have at least given her some personality. It was like watching a tree try to act. Also, I swear at some point I saw her running in place in some CGI heavy scene. She's not Jessica Alba bad, but that's not something to be proud of....

2238004,2,B0007R6Y06,"I remember being six years old and going mad as a hatter with my VHS copy of Walt Disneys 1951 Alice in Wonderland. The pretty colors and zany characters made me want to step into a world of my own like Alice did, which later triggered my obsession with other fantasies such as Harry Potter and Pokmon. Maybe it was the lack of rules and logic that appealed to my peculiar mind of the time, but to this day, Disneys take on Carrolls creation perfectly reflects what goes on in my head.

But Alice Through the Looking Glass directly insults Carrolls imaginationagain. Whys that? Ill start at the beginning. And when I get to the end, Ill stop.

I already hated Tim Burtons take on Alice in Wonderland. It was tonally unfaithful to Lewis Carrolls classic novel, was filled with plot holes deeper than any rabbit hole, and the imagination beyond the art direction was nowhere to be seen. I simply hated every second of that mess of a movie. The rest of the critics pleaded Burton to not make a sequel, but in spite of this very good advice, he did not follow it.

Burton is not directing this continuation of his vision. Rather, The Muppets director James Bobin has that burden. He has stated in the past how he wanted to bring out the Victorian era also satirized by Lewis Carroll, particularly the suffragette movement. Therefore, he combined the twisted material with his comedic background in order to portray a woman who has a choice and a voice in society.

It does start off a bit promising in the films first few moments, as Alice has now become a ship captain in memory of her father, and spent the previous three years traveling the world. She refuses to believe in the word impossible, which shows through her decisions on the job. This would be an excellent role model for girls to follow, if actress Mia Wasikowska cared about the role she was playing. Throughout the entire film, she never reacts to anything, including the death of a coworker, beyond raising her voice a little. It gets honestly annoying most of the time how disinterested she is, even more so than the first movie.

Okay, so her acting as the title role halts any positive impression on the girls watching, but its not the only thing at fault. Take a look at everything else, as in, all the CGI that overpowers the screen in every single frame. Bobin does try to give a different energy from the first film by exploring different parts of Wonderland, and at first, hes somewhat successful at it. When Alice first steps through the mirror into Wonderland, the room she enters is enormous, complete with a yawning tiger rug and talking chess pieces. Next thing she knows, shes falling through birds in square flight patterns into the gathering of all her friends. It all progressively gets curiouser and curiouser as shes taken by her friends into the castle where Time lives, in order to venture back several years and rescue the Mad Hatters parents from the Jabberwocky. This castle looks huge, with the sounds of cranking cogs leading into the castles entrance. From here, theres an incredible sea of time and a kingdom of red vines overrun by glowing blue centipedes. These 3D extravaganza elements are both the films greatest asset and greatest flaw.

Its not only that the CGI looks more like videogame graphics than an actual world, but more like no exploration goes into this already uninteresting reality of uninteresting characters. Theres zero emotion, zero time to look into anything, and zero captivating substance.

Plus, so what if the Mad Hatters may never see his family again? So what if its up to Alice to rescue them for the sake of Wonderland? I was never given a reason to care, and neither was Alice. I guess thats what you get when you resort to coincidences in order to move along an overused plot. It would be so nice for these stories to make sense for a change.

Lewis Carrolls treasured classics have been around for a long time now, and time has inspired thousands of readers to come up with their own interpretations to this new reality. To me, Wonderland is about the autistic mind. To Walt Disney, Wonderland is about a girl seeing all these beautiful colors with unforgettable figures. To Tim Burton, Wonderland needed a makeover in order to become a modern, epic, twisted fantasy for a new generation. Now, his vision gets expanded on to put in another artists take on Wonderland. While theres no problem with doing so, any credibility or reasoning behind this adaptation has lost its way, leaving behind a lack of respect to its source material. Its not about the message like the director claims, its about the pretty visuals I wouldnt mind showing up late to see. But even so, I encourage you to give the original books a read, it just might inspire you to make a book, movie, poem, costume, or art piece someday that feels more real than this impossibly mad mess.

2238007,3,B0007R6Y06,"Though it is not a popular opinion, I rather enjoyed Disney's live action adaptation Alice In Wonderland. So here we are, 6 years later with the sequel Alice Through the Looking Glass.

Is Alice Through the Looking Glass an enjoyable movie? Well for starters, I once again delighted in seeing Mia Wasikowska take on the role of Alice Kingsley and see her do it with undeniable charm. Alice is very much more ready for adventure this time around, but she ends up dealing with a much different opposition than she did in the 2010 movie.
  Sacha Baron Cohen's character ""Time"" actually makes Alice Through the Looking Glass a bit more fun to watch; his scenes are arguably some of the better parts of the movie. Original cast members like Helena Bonham Carter and Anne Hathaway also return as the Red Queen and the White Queen respectively.
  And as expected, the visuals in the movie look equally as good as the effects in the previous film. At times, I felt the writing could have been better, but the script does have some memorable lines/quotables. There are more than just a few things to like in Alice Through the Looking Glass, but unfortunately, the movie has some noticeable problems.
 The plot is a bit too messy at times, sometimes with certain scenes feeling abrupt and uninteresting. The tone here isn't as dark as the previous movie(probably due mostly to the switch in directors from Tim Burton to James Bobin); which may or may not be a problem for viewers. Some of the characters aren't as fun to watch here as they were in the first film, and, as one of Johnny Depp's biggest fans, I must admit that even his character Mad Hatter falls victim to what I just aforementioned.

Whereas the first movie was about Alice discovering Wonderland, Alice Through the Looking Glass is more about her helping her dear friend the Mad Hatter. Overall, I'd say Alice Through the Looking Glass is just an OK sequel. There are some likable moments and characters, but I feel that it certainly could have been better in certain aspects.

Depressing story that is boring, a Mad Hatter who is no fun at all, and Alice who reminds me more of Mulan than the charming little girl from the books. The White Queen has issues that are so incredibly uncharacteristic to original lore. Only the Queen of Hearts gives a decent portrayal and is believable. The rest is just YUCK!

2238045,4,B0007R6Y06,"Although this film bears little resemblance to the original story except for its inclusion of some characters, it is an entertaining and spectacular production. Alice is an admirable protagonist - headstrong and brave, compassionate and forgiving. Her role embodies one of the film's key themes, the importance of family and the possibilities of forgiveness and redemption within the family context.

Other characters provide equally strong performances so that the film crackles with the interchanges between fascinating and engaging larger than life personalities. The film cleverly balances caricature and poignancy.

Visually it utilises classic Burton style. From the opening, it is dark and forbidding, pervaded by powerful Gothic imagery and a spectacular clockpunk aesthetic. The visual trope of time and its concomitant theme of fate gives the film depth and thoughtfulness.

At times it does seem drawn out, wildly dramatic for its own sake, rather than propelling the narrative. Depp's Mad Hatter portrayal seems to be merely going through the motions.

One of the films qualities is its appeal to a broad audience. Unlike many films pitched at children, it does not condescend to them and its appeal extends to adults and fans of Gothic and Fantasy. Darker than the previous Alice film, and containing less fairy tale magic, Alice Through the Looking Glass portrays women of the Victorian era asserting independence rather than conforming to gender expectations.",1464912000,13,1474,5.4801762114537445
2238046,2,B0007R6Y06,"Heaven bless and preserve Hollywood fabulist Tim Burton and his delightfully twisted creative genius.

If ever there was a filmmaker born to adapt Lewis Carroll's Alice stories, Burton is it. And he tried, he really did, to bring us a wondrous work with his deeply flawed 2010 entry Alice in Wonderland.

To hardcore Burton fans, it wasn't good enough, marred by (among other things) a ludicrous turn by Johnny Depp as a Mad Hatter more fit for Bedlam than Wonderland. But the picture made $1.025 billion, convincing Walt Disney Studios it had the makings of a winning new franchise.

Half a dozen years later, we have the first sequel. And I'm sorry to say that Alice Through the Looking Glass, directed by relative newcomer James Bobin (The Muppets), is a dull, formulaic theme-park ride whose only purpose is to make more pots of money.

Looking Glass reunites most of the original cast, incuding Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter, Anne Hathaway as the flighty White Queen, and Helena Bonham Carter as the perpetually enraged Red Queen. They are joined by Sacha Baron Cohen as Time - yes, Time, the tick-tocking dude himself.

For all its faults, Burton's film was a painterly treat that used digital effects to create a rich, textured world ripe for discovery. It was about a Victorian teen who gets to explore a fantastical new world where she meets exotic creatures and crazy characters.

Looking Glass refigures Carroll's characters as action heroes, plunging them into an absurd sci-fi adventure story right out of Doctor Who. You see, Mad Hatter is going mad (even madder, I guess) because he's convinced that his family, who were supposedly killed by the Jabberwocky, are still alive.

Eager to help her friends, Alice steals Time's time machine so she can find out what really happened to Hatter's kin.

Cohen, the film's only bright spot, delivers a wacky turn as a mildly mad deity in charge of making sure the temporal flow continues smoothly. Time travel would ruin everything he's built, so he hops on another time machine and goes chasing after Alice.

Looking Glass tries to simulate excitement by speeding up the action, the music, and the tempo and ratcheting up the CGI, transforming the gorgeous tableaus created by Burton into a dizzying perpetual-motion onslaught.

But behind all the chases and the battles in Alice Through the Looking Glass, behind the conflicts and the bravado, there beats a hollow heart.",1464912000,7,2454,4.934466019417476

She ends up back in Wonderland where she must go back in time in order to save Hatter Tarrant Hightopp, who believes his parents are alive, but who died. She meets Time (Sacha Baron Cohen), a kinder German version of Rasputin type of man who must endure a rash of puns.

As the film progresses, only Alice can save all of time, space, and dimension and realizes you only have one family.

This film lacked the action, scenes, drama, and adrenaline flow of the first one. Through the time travel sequences we obtain background information of the queens and why their relationship as sisters fell apart. It seems the Queen of Hearts didn't eat the tarts after all.

I enjoy sitting near the front for the nap-of-the-earth flight scenes, of which there are many in this movie, as Alice travels through time and oceans of space in Time's Chronosphere.

Sacha Baron Cohen, to our great amusement, plays the role of Time, who serves as ""the straight man"" and the butt of numerous jokes in several comedic segments.

We were also delighted by the costumes, scenery, and architecture, as well as the heart-warming, family-oriented morals to this story.

We found Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter disturbingly light in the loafers with his lisp; presumably, this is affected to advance the Illuminati and Hollywood's pro-homosexual agenda.
