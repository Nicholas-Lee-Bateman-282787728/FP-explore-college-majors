8448569,5,B004YMAWQM,"I really enjoyed this short-film.  I actually used it for a paper in my History class.  I'm 20 years old and in college, but I had no idea about ""paper sons and daughters"".  This really blew my mind and I really enjoyed it.",1459641600,,223,4.1395348837209305
8448570,5,B004YMAWQM,My own father was a paper son...the only difference was that we were told at a fairly young age.  He has since passed away and I am glad that we knew the story.  I did wish that the movie was a little longer.,1388275200,,208,3.813953488372093
8448571,4,B004YMAWQM,"Nice video about a dark chapter in American history not often discussed or taught in schools.  It is emotionally devastating for Paper Sons to carry a false identity and shocking for their descendents to discover they are not really who they thought they were.  I wished it was more of a full length movie instead of a short video, or it could at least include a short documentary about the history of Paper Sons.",1311292800,3,413,4.5675675675675675
8448572,4,B004YMAWQM,"As a proud daughter of immigrant parents from China, I was thrilled to see this excellent short film.  It helps that my brother, Jack Ong stars in it!
All the actors in this show so much genuine emotion over this subject of shame for some families.  My own parents did not have ""paper names"", but
I married into a family who did have although there was no shame with them.  Thank you to both sets of parents for the sacrifices you made so that
I could be born an American!
