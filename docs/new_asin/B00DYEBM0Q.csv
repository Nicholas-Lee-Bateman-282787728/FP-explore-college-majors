5878986,5,B00DYEBM0Q,"Finally!  I've been waiting years for them to release full seasons of Totally Spies on DVD boxsets!  This show is one of my childhood favorites, and it's still highly entertaining even to me now, and I'm 18!  I showed it to my little sisters and they love it too.  I can't wait for the rest of the seasons and the Totally Spies movie to hopefully come out soon :)",1383523200,2,363,4.217391304347826
5878987,2,B00DYEBM0Q,"I just bought this collection and was thrilled Totally Spies was going to be released officially. Finally! However, this is a bare-bones collection. I've seen bootlegs with better quality. The playback is awful. It seems they were having recording issues when they did these discs. Everything plays slower than normal causing the music to sound droopy, and everyone's voices are deeper because of it. Really bad audio quality. The video quality isn't much better. It doesn't say the aspect ratio on the back of the cover, but I believe it to be 640 x 480. I want HD. I demand HD! I was really expecting better from Marathon.

Once again, I am disappointed with their marketing. The only reason I would ever recommend this product is to give money to Marathon to put forth some better products. This release is garbage.",1381190400,2,818,4.801418439716312

Update:
After playing some of the discs I noticed 2 of the discs do not have sound on the last minute of the last episode on the disc.  I'm not sure how the other discs are but this is the only issue I've come across so far.",1490054400,2,314,3.890625

8599184,5,B00DYEBM0Q,"This DVD boxset contains the complete first 3 seasons of Totally Spies.

The audio and picture seemed quite fine to me.  Better than anything you would find on Youtube
There is a strange issue as a previous reviewer mentioned that right near the end of the last episodes on disc 1 and disc 3 of season 2 there is a mysterious silence for a few seconds.  Its not anything major though.
If when you receive your copy you encounter this problem, guess you could always try and contact the company who produced the DVD about it.

The episode 'A Spy is born' is a two part episode but the first part is in season 1 and the second is in season 2.  Why they did it like this I don't know, but if you like watching eps in chronological order you could watch ep 1 followed by 2 as there isn't a real reason not to.

I ordered this DVD from the UK and it got to me under 2 weeks, I was expecting it would take longer !

Here's hoping they will release season 4 to 6 on DVD soon !",1425168000,,969,4.015625

8599186,3,B00DYEBM0Q,"I was initially ecstatic that there was a Totally Spies Collection of the 1st three seasons but then I realized that one of the discs is a duplicate. Namely, the 4th disc of Season 2 is really a duplicate of the 1st disc of Season 2 (which means that Season 2 is incomplete and therefore the collection is not complete because instead of 4 discs of season 2, as in disc 1, disc 2, disc 3, disc 4 ... its disc 1, disc 2, disc 3, and then disc 1 again (a duplicate) ... I made sure that this wasn't an error of disc art by playing both discs (which had the same disc art and episode list) ... There is without a doubt an exact duplicate of Season 2 Disc 1 and likewise an undeniable omission of Season 2 Disc 4; For the moment, I think this is an isolated incident but as a forewarning make sure you check each and every disc ... Each Season is supposed to have 4 disc in this collection for a total of 12 discs but my particular product only has 11 discs + the 1 duplicate disc (I've uploaded pictures as proof ... the duplicate disc has a different shade of color than the other 3 discs)",1419638400,14,1087,4.06046511627907
8599187,5,B00DYEBM0Q,I love it! I don't have a single negative thing to say! It got here fast and now I'm able to relive one of my childhood shows!,1414627200,,126,3.7037037037037037
8599188,5,B00DYEBM0Q,"Was a huge fan of the show, and I love that all of the episodes are on here. A great buy for true Totally Spies fans",1409011200,,116,3.5
8599189,5,B00DYEBM0Q,"Amazing collection! Totally worth the money! But I will say there was a strange moment where the last episode on the each disk in season 2 lost audio in the last 10 seconds of the disk... But still if you are a fan of the show, it is seriously awesome collection!",1404864000,3,263,4.176470588235294
8599190,5,B00DYEBM0Q,This was one of my favorite shows when it first aired on TV and the only thing that would make it better would of been if the Totally Spies movie could of been included in the complete set.  Sort of Charlies Angels meet James Bond we have ordinary Beverly Hills Teens who are really top secret super spies saving the world when their not in class.  Season 3 changes things are the girls goes from living at home to learning to live together on their own as well as their boss Jerry introducing new spy members and a artificial intelligent computer to hand out the gadgets.,1386547200,,572,4.386792452830188
