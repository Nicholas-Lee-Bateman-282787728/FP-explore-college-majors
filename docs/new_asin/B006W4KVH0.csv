5022217,3,B006W4KVH0,"With a title containing all the wit and wisdom of a nine year old, I kept my expectations exceedingly low, i.e. Tempe Video level. The movie is NOT a spoof on ""Breaking Dawn"" but rather a spoof on ""Eclipse."" ""Breaking Dawn"" is spoofed the last few minutes of the film. Breaking wind is something grossly associated with the wolves and Bella. It is overly used in the beginning of the film as well as the low brow sexual humor is excessive. There is a discussion of size of all the main characters sexual organs. ""Cavernous"" was used to describe Bella (Heather Ann Davis) who subscribes to ""Ebony Thunder"" magazine.

Edward (Eric Callero) has some issues with sex that blue pills can't help. Frank Pacheco portrays a rather portly shirtless Jacob who engages in a lot of toilet, implanting, and marking territory humor.

The overly excessive low brow humor diminishes to a tolerable level after Danny Trejo explains the story of the wolves and vampires. It is a humorous story, one I enjoyed as he confounds various movies into one tale. At this point the comedy becomes more of a real movie satire and relies less on cheap body part humor. I thought the actors played a good spoof role, although they should have done another take at the end with the child actors.

The film is supposed to be campy, and had they started with Danny Trejo or redid the gross beginning, it would easily be 4 stars. The spoof of people's dislike for Bella's repulsive character did give me some LOL moments.

As far as ""Twilight"" spoofs go, I would rank this above ""Taintlight"" but below ""Vampires Suck.""

F-bomb, sex spoof including oral and descriptions of gay sex, drawn human body parts, and fake male organs.",1331337600,8,1693,4.686868686868687
5022218,2,B006W4KVH0,"I have to admit that I'm not a fan of the Twilight series and I only watched this because I enjoy making fun of the genre.  The movie seems to follow the storyline of one of the Twilight movies, which one I am not sure.  The guys playing Edward and Jacob had me laughing at how stupid they looked and how ridiculous the whole thing was, and the ""Bella"" of this movie made me realize that Bella in the real movies probably secretly loved having two guys fight over her and two secret societies essentially going to war over her and loving all the attention.

The funniest parts of this movie were the Leroy Jenkins reference, (That made me smile) and the performance given by Danny Trejo.  His performance had me laughing like crazy and is the main reason this movie gets two stars instead of just one.

If you like making fun of Twilight, then you will enjoy this movie, but it is pretty goofy.",1431993600,,894,4.36144578313253

5022249,3,B006W4KVH0,"Yet another parody movie, but at least this one wasn't made by the same bunch of morons who have been killing the genre in the past few years with those god awful movies that combine current movies in a dumb way instead of making them in a funny way.

As you can probably guess, it's a parody of Breaking Dawn... a movie I refuse to watch since I had to suffer through the first Twilight film. So, of coarse, I probably did enjoy this movie more than a Twilight fan would.

According to my fiance, it's almost word for word of the movie with jokes thrown in... it didn't look like it was going to be a funny movie, not after witnessing the opening scene which apparently is just like how the movie started, only it ended on a useless fart noise. It did get me laughing after that tho with some things that where just so over the top and stupid I couldn't help laughing and saying WTF? at the same time.

I think the plot of it was something about new vampires coming to eat Bella and the Sparkling wimps and the Wolf Pac that pee on everything have to align together to protect her. that's about it, the rest is just nonsense and humor. Sure, not everything is funny, but it does have it's moments. What killed the movie in the end was during the closing credits it says it's dedicated to Twilight fans and shows clips of them watching trailers of it, which was both sad and annoying at the same time that people like that could be so obsessed with a movie.

A couple of things in the movie could have been a lot funnier... like the fact that Edward is a vampire, and he has trouble getting an erection, but by the end of the movie he gets one... they should have stuck to the reality of the situation that IF a vampire could exist, he would have no blood in his body, therefor his heart wouldn't be pumping any bloody for him to even get an erection... I thought that was the angle they where going for, but no, they screwed it up and let him have one.

They should have also kept going with the gags about Jacob peeing on everything, after all, he is a dog, and he's ""imprinting"" himself while watching a dog show on TV... which is porn to pups, that was funny, but not enough exploring that I don't think.

Overall, rent it, or do the DL thing, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. You might watch it one more time in future if you forget most of what happened, but I don't think it's something you would race to view again in the near future.",1350604800,,2445,4.213675213675214

Bella is still just as melodramatic as ever and in love with Edward. Obese Jacob often tries to sleep with her, but gets turned down as always.

I love to laugh, I love movies that make fun of other movies, but this one wasn't it, it really is so bad I really don't recommend it to any one.

The ""comedy"" was beyond corny .. really, really cheesy.  I tried to get through it for most of the day (after pausing here it & there to do more exciting things like.. wash dishes) but ultimately just could not. I will say however that they did manage to find actors that are very similar in appearance to the actual ""Twilight"" actors, and for that I tacked on a star.

I have to start by saying that I am not a ""Twilight"" fan at all. I thought ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" was OK but the other ones I fell asleep in. I open with that to say that I would rather watch a marathon of all of them before watching this again. Most spoofs add parts of other movies in a spot where they make sense. This one felt like in the middle of a scene they were like...put this in, most of the time it didn't make sense. During a fight scene all of Johnny Depp's characters come out for no apparent reason. I thought that ""Vampires Suck"" was OK, but this was not. The only good thing is the very end when they show actual peoples reactions to watching trailers for """"Eclipse"" and I only cracked a smile at that part. Overall, unless you like watching people fart and poop a lot I would avoid this one. I did however think the fact that they made Jacob a fat guy was kinda neat. This is not a good movie at all though. I give it a D+.",1332288000,10,1109,4.02262443438914
