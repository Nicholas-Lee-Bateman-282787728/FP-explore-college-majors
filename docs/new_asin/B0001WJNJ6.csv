8016889,5,B0001WJNJ6,A great presentation of a greta college basketball game.  I did not realize that the DVD would provide the full footage of the game (minus commercials).  I saw the actual game and this DVD allowed me to relive all of the anticipation and excitment of when the game actaully took place.  I will treasure having this DVD in my sports video library.,1338336000,,346,4.548387096774194
8016890,4,B0001WJNJ6,"I am a huge MSU fan, but wasn't alive to enjoy this spectacle when it happened.  This is a great document of that time and an event that changed sports in America.  Naturally, this is also where most people first got a glimpse of Magic and Bird in action.  The picture quality is very good for archived footage from 1979, the audio is adequate as well.

You get the pre- and post-game coverage (which was refreshingly short compared to the all-day affairs we have now) and, of course, the complete game.  The commercials have been edited out, so you get pure game after the quick pre-show. There aren't really any extras to speak of.

The only downside I can see is that this is actually not a very interesting or exciting game all on its own.  The real excitement happened in the games leading up to this.  Bird and Magic would have other -better- opportunities to appear ""on-stage"" in their professional careers.  So if you keep that in mind, this is a great buy for a Bird, Magic, MSU or ISU fan.

I would recommend the book ""When March Went Mad"" as a great companion to this DVD.",1236556800,8,1083,4.424242424242424
