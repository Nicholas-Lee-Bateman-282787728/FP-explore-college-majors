 Cezanne was a solitary person who spent more time with nature than with people. His involvement with people was that of  a focused, penetrating spectator.
Being motivated in an intuitive way  he invented multiple perspective approach
with several views in his painting. he invented surrealist painting and a great sensitivity toward angles.
He brought to painting new themes like apples from the focused view of a total painter,  undisturbed by other matters. He invented new combinations of colors like green and blue, as in nature.
Cezanne is quoted as saying ""Art is a parallel harmony to nature, it is not just about looking or copying
but about feeling too.""
In his undisturbed  expression of inner personal feeling in his painting, he was before his time  and has to pay the price  by not being accepted.
This DVD asks a question about the bathers in an un explained position and situation.
I think  this picture  is connected to the fact that Sezanne is connected to nature as much as
to people and he looks at people from  a natural perspective of time and place.  The real theme is
people as part of nature.
Cezanne is very sensitive to the individual person. He finds inspiration in ordinary people,
an inspiration paralleled in  other artists like Anna Sokolow, who used  as an example to ask her pupils
""have you seen Cezanne's apples?""",1005436800,20,1515,4.780769230769231
