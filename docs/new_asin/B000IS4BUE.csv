8365075,5,B000IS4BUE,"Best workout ever!! This is a great workout for both men and women! The VHS showing Candace leading floor exercises is very effective for toning and losing weight.  You'll notice results in 2 weeks.  The exercises themselves, once learned, take about 10 min. to do. Candace shows you how to rest during exercising if you can't keep up with each repetition.  The floor exercises are low-impact.  Within a month, you will be so toned and will have lost in dress and pants sizes.  Great for women who have had a baby and want to get back in shape, once the doctor gives permission to exercise.  This will do it!  I know the routine by memory now.",1314230400,,643,4.491379310344827
