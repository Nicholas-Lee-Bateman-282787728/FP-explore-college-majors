Watching the animal antics off to the sides is lots of fun and we are big fans of Neil!  Thanks for sharing with us Becky, it's great having your videos as a guide!  :)",1475280000,,263,4.0

6554683,3,B00M3G13AK,"Some good information, hate watching the intro to the show for each episode, wish that was cut out.  Moves a little slow to get to any good content.  Also, feel like she needs to do a little more research or add disclaimers at the end of episodes when things could be done better.  For example mixing lye indoors without a mask.  In a follow up episode she does wear a mask, but still question the use of the plastic tubs to dissolve lye for soap making.",1458000000,3,454,4.244186046511628

6554685,3,B00M3G13AK,"Great information, but short programs, and constant openings of the story of building the home single-handed.  It gets extremely boring after 22 times",1426464000,,150,5.521739130434782
6554686,5,B00M3G13AK,"I recently found Becky's Homestead site and purchased the latest DVD.  It was well done, provides good general information about the various aspects of homesteading, and the instructions are easily understood for the person just getting started.  I emailed Becky with a question not addressed in the video and she emailed me back with information.  If you are looking for some good ideas and how to carry them out, I suggest this video.",1407801600,,436,4.945205479452055

8670018,5,B00M3G13AK,I love Becky! She is just herself in recording these videos. My husband and I watch her just to see her infectious joy and her animals. I like that she's not professional and perfect. It makes her presentation more engaging. Some of the things she says are just a riot. Enjoy!,1514678400,,276,4.431372549019608
