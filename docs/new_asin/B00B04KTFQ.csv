5539105,5,B00B04KTFQ,"One of the best ever made and also a most realistic yuri (and even basic romantic relationship) portrayals of any anime Ive yet seen. Not even ""fluff"", but emotionally beautiful and a series far too short. A favorite and a must own.",1363305600,16,232,4.5476190476190474
8560074,5,B00B04KTFQ,Fantastic! One of the best anime out there and it even came with an art booklet. Definitely recommend it!,1515196800,,105,4.578947368421052
8560075,5,B00B04KTFQ,"One of the all-time greats, a classic of yuri anime.  Stellar.

The manga is even better.",1477785600,2,89,4.5
8560076,5,B00B04KTFQ,"Another great story of innocent girl love and the friendship behind it.  Manga has much more of the story but overall, it's a good watch.",1474329600,3,137,4.48
8560077,5,B00B04KTFQ,"Probably in my top-three anime series of all time list. This is a yuri anime that really focuses on the emotional reality. It's not about any fan service, definitely written with a strong truth to it. The complexities of the characters unfolding understandings of themselves and their sexuality is deftly handled, the mistakes in how they treat each other are all too real, but there is enough sweetness and kindness and hope to keep you going even when your eyes are welling up in shared pain. Definitely read the manga to get the rest of the story and also read and watch the mangaka's other long story: Hourou Musuko which deals with some other types of LGBT issues in an equally poignant way.",1452816000,2,696,4.666666666666667
8560078,5,B00B04KTFQ,"A great yuri anime that avoids the typical tropes and pitfalls of all the others, but is seemingly only half the story, as there was supposed to be a second season, this makes sense. Beautiful animation, likeable characters, great opening and closing",1428364800,3,250,4.976190476190476
8560079,5,B00B04KTFQ,I love this anime!!!! It was my first yuri anime and it holds a special place for me. It arrived nice and fast and in perfect condition!,1424908800,,136,4.074074074074074
8560080,4,B00B04KTFQ,"this is truly a wonderful show. there is no fanservice what so ever, and the romance is dealt with as a shoujo ai (spiritual or emotional side of female love, as opposed to yuri which is the first part plus sexual scenes. though the degree of sexuality vs emotion in a yuri varies depending on the show).

this has great characters, and a story that revolves around the relationships they develop. this is a must own for anyone who claims to be a yuri/shoujo-ai fan, a must watch for any anime fan, and quite frankly a must watch for anyone with a heart. of course its not quite realistic because homosexuality is taboo in japan (?), but there is still a message here... love is powerful no matter where it comes from!

this is an adaptation of the manga, and though the anime doesn't look like it will be getting another season or reboot, the manga would be worth a read to help provide a more conclusive ending. not that the ending is bad, its great, and provides the 'happy-ending' element we all love, but the manga is the real conclusion to their story and you will just want to read it after completing the anime because you loved the story so much.

UPDATE: of course the show is still great, one of the best. that hasn't changed, but... the subtitles in this are pixel-y. its a minor gripe but it is noticeable. SHOULD NOT DETER YOU FROM SUPPORTING THIS GREAT SHOW!!!",1395187200,4,1375,4.448412698412699
8560081,5,B00B04KTFQ,"Whether you're into yuri anime or not, Aoi Hana is a wonderful story about falling in love with a friend, and growing up. It would be nice if they put out a second series of anime now that the manga is finished (somewhat hurriedly), but even if they don't, I think this was wrapped up in a nice way.",1376956800,4,299,4.084745762711864
8560082,4,B00B04KTFQ,well this was pitched as two young girls falling in love so sounds like a typical lesbian anime but this was far from adult it is more about a girl falling in love for the first time and being confuseed if you can fall in love with another woman this has of course been done before nothing special here it's an o.k. story as far as it goes i guess at least it was a lot shorter than strawberry panic which did the same thing but was way too long this a story for pepole who like altanate lifestyles.could have been better but not a bad anime no nudeity or sex here so you do not have to worry about that might be worth a watch when it comes down in price a little.,1372809600,2,664,3.962686567164179
8560083,4,B00B04KTFQ,"(Review named after episode 10 of this series, a personal favorite)

Sweet Blue Flowers (Or Aoi Hana as it is dubbed in its native language) is an original story by Shimura Takako that, with a slight realist touch, blends romance, slice-of-life, and coming of age elements to form one of the finest comic series you may ever have the pleasure of reading. In 2009, Sweet Blue Flowers received a well-deserved anime adaptation, and last year, Rightstuf licensed it for English release. Finally, it has reached North American shores in physical form!

Sweet Blue Flowers is about Fumi, a young lesbian girl, her friends, and their relationships. It sounds like a fairly typical show about teenage girls, right? But it isn't. There are no major plot complications, there is no melodrama, this is a sophisticated and mature series about realistic characters engaging in a realistic manner. At first the series can come across as just a bit daunting. The viewer is dropped into a world in which characters already have complex, dynamic relationships that aren't immediately explained. Given time though, characters become fleshed out, their ties to each other given perspective, and we are treated to a soft view of everyday life for these youths. Takako has a great knack for subtlety, and it is shown exquisitely from beginning to end.

Even so, the level of potential content in the series can still seem overwhelming. The story of Fumi and Akira's friendship could easily take up its own 12 episode series. At least one main character and her love life could most definitely do the same. This comes off as both a strength and a weakness, and only a little of this potential content is used.

The adaptation overall is quite good. It essentially runs through the first three volumes of the manga series, and really only significantly changes things in the final episode. What cuts and changes there are work very well within this short animated adaptation. This is as faithful an adaptation as one could hope for. The animation is wonderful throughout. The use of watercolor backgrounds and simple art design complements the storytelling almost perfectly. While the voice-acting was initially a slight turn-off for me, I found myself liking it more as the series went on. The subtitles are generally excellent, though if you like honorifics in yours (I really do), you may not love them. The music is good overall, though the opening is perhaps a bit misleading.

My main criticism is one that I also have of the original work. In terms of presentation, everything about this story moves slowly. But in terms of plot movement, the audience is occasionally left to fill in blanks they might not be used to having to fill. In this sense, it almost seems wrong to call Sweet Blue Flowers a romance - one brief kiss, a few confessions and some slight relationship drama is all the fluff we're treated to. Additionally, some plot threads are left hanging ever so slightly as the series concludes. The rather sad truth is that Aoi Hana is still running as a manga series, and this adaptation (which is complete and will not receive a second season) briefly covers just about 2/5 of its content.

Available at the time of this writing on Amazon for $25, or Rightstuf for $30. Simply put, if you're a fan of yuri, romance, slice-of-life, or just a good, realistic story, this series is worth well your time and money!",1365638400,9,3406,4.853700516351119
