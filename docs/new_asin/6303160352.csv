8203835,1,6303160352,The DVD was way overpriced for the short and barely even educational content.  I only bought it to replace one from the school library that we temporarily lost (unfortunately we found it again).  The school tried to charge us $60 for this 30 minute DVD.  This was cheaper for the same thing but I honestly wouldn't even pay $1.00 for it....,1390348800,,340,4.540983606557377
8203836,1,6303160352,We put this in our vcr/dvd player as soon as we received it and it didn't even work.  :(  My boys were so disappointed.,1343088000,,119,3.9166666666666665
8203837,5,6303160352,"Bill Nye Videos are the best ! They provide a great intro and give valuable background information in a fun and educational way. I used these all the time when I taught elementary and the kids loved them. I am using them now with my daughter who is in Kindergarten. Although the concept of Dinosaurs is pretty nebulous, it was fun for her to watch. She totally got the big ideas of that dinosaurs never lived when people did, how large they were and theories about extinction. Worth the money. One of the best Bill Nye videos was the one on the moon.",1302480000,,550,4.349514563106796
