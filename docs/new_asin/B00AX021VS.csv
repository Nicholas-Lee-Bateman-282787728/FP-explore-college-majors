8558685,4,B00AX021VS,A nice long walk around a pyramid and a religious site.,1489622400,,55,4.090909090909091
8558686,5,B00AX021VS,Just before I received this I had a lightning hit and it blew my HDMI inputs so I just finally got to watch it on a new TV. Very revealing. I realize the area is not as romantic as I had envisioned and the is strewn with large pieces of stones that have broken away and fallen off yet the public is allowed to roam freely. I very much appreciated the hand written note included by the company owners? Very nice touch. Probably the only better experience than these videos would be VR. I intend to buy more!,1482105600,,506,4.173469387755102
