I know there is another options that has everything doing right in other movie/provider ....but oh well.",1447113600,,330,4.689655172413793
8329671,5,B001O4VECE,"I love this film; it's imperfect, and that's what makes it so wonderful. The plot is sweet, funny, and sad. I am happy to see Wu Chun in his debut film role, and will happily support Wu Chun in all his future film endeavors!",1244246400,2,224,4.113636363636363
8329672,5,B001O4VECE,"THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE. IT WAS DIRECTED BY THE SAME DIRECTOR AS JET LI'S ""HERO"". IF YOU HAVE SEEN ""HERO"" YOU WILL NOTICE THAT THE DIRECTOR USES SOME SIMILAR  FIGHT SCENES AND POSES FROM ""HERO"" IN THIS MOVIE, YOU JUST HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION. IT LOOKED AMAZING, GREAT STORY, GREAT CHARACTERS, THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN RELEASED IN THE USA IN THE THEATRES, IT WAS ON THE SAME LEVEL AS CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON. AND AGAIN DID I MENTION THAT THE FIGHT SCENES WERE AMAZING, THE CHARACTER WHO PLAYS THE ""MEDIC"" IS FUNNY TOO. YOU'LL LAUGH. THIS IS A MUST HAVE.",1234915200,4,561,4.5
