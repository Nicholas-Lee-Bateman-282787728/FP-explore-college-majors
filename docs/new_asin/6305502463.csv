7891347,1,6305502463,"I didn't give it one star because I didn't like the show, but because it didn't work. I tried it on both my VHS players and there was either no video, or no audio, or sometimes there was neither.  What can you expect, I guess, from a 20+ year old VHS tape.  Too bad, I was really looking forward to it.",1377993600,,302,3.9344262295081966
7891348,3,6305502463,"First of all,this was a short lived CBS Sunday night series called ""Cades County"".I did not expect a real clear copy VHS and tracking had to be used to steady the picture. THIS IS NOT A COMPLAINT AGAINST THE SELLER!!! I was happy just to find anything on this show!
With Glenn Ford and a very old Edgar Buchanan, a desert area cop show that I enjoyed when it was on. Outstanding bad guy Bobby Darin thinks he is Billy the Kid in the first segment. A good purchase who remember this show fondly. One note,in some scenes it's seems as if Ford doesn't quite have the lines down pat and kind of wings it. Movie stars could do that on TV.",1324857600,7,633,4.19672131147541
