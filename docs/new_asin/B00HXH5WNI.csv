6242958,5,B00HXH5WNI,"I watched this program on it's original run on NBC SO many years ago. I loved the show then and was so disappointed that it failed to get the ratings to keep the show beyond the one season at the time. Seeing this show now, I feel the show is even MORE charming than I remember it from 42 years ago. A delightful blend of humor, warmth and love of family and traditional values so missing from entertainment today.",1394064000,32,414,4.253164556962025
6242959,4,B00HXH5WNI,"Warner Archive has to be commended for digging into the vaults and bringing to light the obscure and nearly-forgotten.  That seems to be the case with ""The Jimmy Stewart Show"" which must have been filed in the vault under ""Amusing TV Sitcom Starring A Screen Legend.""

""The Jimmy Stewart Show"" presented by Warner Archive is given first class treatment which is befitting of Mr. Stewart. The picture quality is beautifully sharp with bold, bright colors. In fact, the prints appear to have been taken from the original camera negatives. The sound is excellent and the packaging is nicely done.

The series premiered on NBC during the 1971-72 season and lasted only one season for a total of 24 episodes. It was created by the legendary Hal Kantor who also wrote, produced, and directed many of the episodes.

According to Kantor's autobiography ""So Far, So Funny: My Life in Show Business,"" Jimmy Stewart's agents wanted him to star in an hour-long drama of some type. However, Universal managed to entice Stewart to star in a 30 minute sitcom as long as Stewart could co-own the production company (along with Kantor) and be paid a hefty salary. As a result, in 1971, Stewart became the highest paid actor on a television series being paid $33,333.33 per episode. It is also the first time that James Stewart ever allowed himself to be billed as ""Jimmy"" Stewart.

In the series, Stewart portrays Dr. James K. Howard, a professor of anthropology at a small college  founded by his grandfather and located in Easy Valley, California. But Jimmy Stewart basically plays Jimmy Stewart in his usual slow talking, slow moving way as he ambles from one situation to another. His family, on the other hand, is a bit more complicated.

Stewart's beautiful wife is portrayed by Julie Adams, the damsel in distress from ""Creature From the Black Lagoon.""  Ms. Adams looks all of 39, yet she is the mother of two sons by Stewart, one 29 and one eight. Stewart is supposed to be in his 50's in this series, but looks more like his real age of 63.

Stewart's 29-year-old son also has a son who just happens to be eight, and both eight-year-olds are hard to tell apart. In the pilot episode, Stewart is at his 29-year-old son's house baby sitting his eight-year-old grandson while the parents are out on the town. Later that night, Stewart lights a cigar and then falls asleep on the couch, accidentally setting the house on fire. He is roused by his grandson and they are both saved, but the house burns to the ground.

Now homeless, Stewart's older son, his cute wife (portrayed by Ellen Geer, Will Geer's daughter), and their young son are forced to move into Stewart's home until they can rebuild their house. And it's this chain of events that sets the wheels in motion for this series.

It's possible that ""The Jimmy Stewart Show"" will appeal to the many fans of Jimmy Stewart and Julie Adams, and it most certainly is a good opportunity to see an example of what some sitcoms of that period were like.

The viewer can expect an entertaining show filled with good natured and gentle humor. Stewart opens each episode speaking directly to the viewer and ends each episode the same way. As the stories progress, he often breaks the fourth wall and talks to the viewer. And it's amazing how this little bit of shtick actually does begin to create a personal connection between Stewart and his audience.

I noticed that Jimmy Stewart and the cast seemed to get more comfortable with their roles as the series progressed. If it had been renewed for a second season, the series just might have caught on.

Some of the episodes are quite amusing like the one where Stewart agrees to play his accordian at a bachelor party not knowing that there's a fan dancer performing behind him. The place gets raided and Stewart later defends both himself and the fan dancer in court.

In another episode, Stewart's older son, a contractor who is building a sandwich shop, unearths a human skull at the construction site. It is then carbon dated by the college and discovered to be 30,000 years old. Stewart has to use his wits to calm down the future sandwich shop owner about the delays in construction while an archaeological dig is being conducted. Caesar Romero is the guest star.

Like so many other series, ""The Jimmy Stewart Show"" passed through the portals of television history and was filed away in a vault where it waited to be rediscovered. So thank you Warner Archive for bringing this amusing slice of the Seventies to light.",1391731200,59,4511,4.7201017811704835

6242962,5,B00HXH5WNI,I really miss good TV shows. If it weren't for DVD's we wouldn't have anything to watch. The TV shows of today are pure trash.,1444521600,,126,4.08
6242963,1,B00HXH5WNI,"I coughed up a lot of money for this DVD set. I'm a 70's kid and I like to collect shows that I didn't see during their original run for whatever the reason. I can see why this show didn't catch my attention. It's too sloooow! I'm very much into the all-American family and clean-living thing, which we don't see anymore on television today. But this shows drags. I had a heck of a time getting through episode one, and couldn't even finish the second. So I jumped ahead to the Kate Jackson episode thinking she could save it. But nope. This episode dragged as well and I couldn't take it another minute. Jimmy was trying to fix the kitchen sink when Kate walked in and I would have preferred the camera pulling back so we could see the TV crew, lights, stage, the script girl and maybe even the exit door to the studio. It would have been far more entertaining.

I will continue to buy ""lost"" shows like this because I might actually strike gold someday. The seventies had a lot of great TV shows on all three networks, all competing against each other from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM, seven nights a week. We couldn't watch it all even when we got our VCR in 1978. Someday I'll get back to this show and try to sit through another episode.",1442707200,3,1234,4.296137339055794
6242964,5,B00HXH5WNI,"I remember watching this show when it first came out.  What a treasure! Delightful family show with amazing acting by the entire cast.  I adore anything James Stewart is in, and this is no exception.  You won't be disappointed with this gem!",1436486400,,241,4.690476190476191
6242965,5,B00HXH5WNI,"What a find, having this lovely and overlooked TV series on DVD!  I remember it from my childhood and I also remember how disappointed I was when the show was canceled by the network.  I have so enjoyed watching it again, and recommend it, it's wonderful, and also recommend the seller, item shipped promptly, and it's just been great adding this to my ""good old days"" TV & movie DVD collection.",1436054400,5,395,4.549295774647887
6242966,3,B00HXH5WNI,Because it was Jimmy Stewart I thought it was going to be great. The story lines were too similar. Picture was very acceptable and price was good.,1424908800,,146,4.444444444444445
6242967,4,B00HXH5WNI,"James Stewart ranks among the most versatile actors of all time. This was his first and only TV series, premiering in September, 1972. Best described as gentle escapist fun, effectively presented without an audience or laugh track. The comedy was situation driven, rather than verbal or physical. Julie Adams as Jimmy's wife and John McGiver as his colleague and neighbor were very good. Highlight was Stewart's acting reunion with Ruth Hussey, one of his costars from Philadelphia Story in 1940! Nicely done. Recommend this!",1423353600,5,525,5.261904761904762

6242970,5,B00HXH5WNI,"This is a great series, well done, Jimmy lives on in another format, a TV sitcom series. This is right up there with the characters Mr. Stewart has played in the movies that everyone loved, in this one he is a bike riding, college professor with a cardigan sweater/Cowboy hat, and a wife, family, and an old friend that hangs around. He fits the role like a glove, and often talks to the audience out in TV land or sometimes gives us a look or a wink which reminds me of Elwood winking at Harvey, if you know the movie ""Harvey"" ( if you don't you need to see that classic). It is refreshing to see a nice series that leaves you with a good feeling and have him actually wish the audience ""peace,love and laughter"" at the end of each episode. Nowadays I tell my grown kids that if you want to watch something good on TV, you're going to have to put it on yourself. Well, put this on and enjoy.",1412726400,4,892,4.161849710982659
6242971,3,B00HXH5WNI,"I have always loved Jimmy Stewart in the movies. You can't get much more like able for an actor. The Tom Hanks of his time. But this show while very clean was dreadfully slow. The cast seems to mesh well and it's a pleasant enough diversion but it was just not funny! If you want to see him in something he's more suited to check out ""Hawkins"" where he played a lawyer if it's available!",1411948800,,387,4.173333333333333

6242973,5,B00HXH5WNI,"What  a fantastic sitcom from the seventies.  Jimmy Stewart shines in his role of Professor James K. Howard.  His gentle way humor work perfectly here.  The rest of the cast was superb & played off of Stewart with ease.  I loves the scenes where he plays his accordian & tries to relate to his son, Peter.  My only regret is they only made one season.  If you love nostalgia you will totally enjoy this wonderful series. I recommend it highly for your DVD collection.  Don't miss out on this gem.",1407628800,7,496,4.433333333333334

I love the way he talks to the audience breaking the fourth wall.  The supporting cast is very good--particularly old pros Julie Adams (as Jimmy's wife) and John McGiver as his best friend.  The small kids are well played and not at all bratty like so many of the TV kids of today.  Good guest stars appear such as Mary Wickes, Will Geer and a very young Kate Jackson.
