2118254,4,B0002SQO8C,"This is a terrific story with a terrific message told in a way that's interesting and exciting  - my 8-yr-old son loved it and even my 11-yr-old daughter liked it!  The characters are ""awesome"" (his words) and the action/animation is top-notch.  He and several of his friends have watched it - one even borrowed it to watch at home.  Angel Wars grabbed my attention as well and I watched the whole thing with them - I especially loved the music.",1099440000,,445,4.525
2118255,5,B0002SQO8C,Very entertaining with amazing animation!!  I bought on for my 8 year old nephew and it's his favorite DVD!!,1099008000,8,108,4.684210526315789
2118256,5,B0002SQO8C,Got a copy for my kids but my wife and I ended up watching the whole thing!  The special features kept the kids going for hours - really a fun show.  I want to see the next one already!,1099008000,7,185,3.717948717948718
2118257,5,B0002SQO8C,"The animation is superb, the characters are terrific, the action keeps you going, and the music is great.  I can't wait to see more.  I watch it over and over. So will you.",1098748800,7,172,4.181818181818182
2118258,4,B0002SQO8C,"I buy these for my 5 year old son. Like it or not, boys like battling, I found these and figure they satisfy my son't interest in battling while still clearly showing the good versus evil and good prevailing. I loves these movies. My 7 and 12 yr old daughters will watch them with him, but not enjoy them as much as him. The 7 year old still gets into it though.",1377129600,,362,4.041666666666667
2118259,5,B0002SQO8C,"I have always been interested in angels and wondered about their influence in our live, what they look like and what they do",1373414400,,124,4.434782608695652
2118260,5,B0002SQO8C,"I rec'd the dvd in only 4 days and in perfect condition, Thx much, grandson will love it! Very happy with this purchase.",1315872000,,120,4.260869565217392
2118261,5,B0002SQO8C,"I have all of the angel wars dvd's now and I absolutely love them. The youth of today need more spiritual cartoons that are of this quality (graphics, sound, storyline, objective & biblical truth). It's been a few years since the last episode was released. I hope the creators continue the series.",1309737600,2,297,4.730769230769231
2118262,1,B0002SQO8C,"A really cheesy computer animated cartoon. They didn't even have other languages to choose from. Angels were following an 11 year old skateboarder. I didn't care about the skater and I didn't care about the angels. Personally, I love angels. I have books all about different angels. I have The Dictionary Of Angels. But none of these angels were anything like angels from the bible. I was so dissappointed.",1298073600,,406,4.898550724637682
2118263,4,B0002SQO8C,"This movie is a christian film. It's based on the spirit world, and shouldn't be called just an action film. There are christian artists that sing, like Hawk Nelson, and Tobymac. This is a christian film.",1249084800,,204,4.694444444444445
2118264,5,B0002SQO8C,Angel Wars is entertaining and a welcome alternative for Christian parents to provide to their offspring who like this type of viewing. They are best viewed in order.,1206144000,2,166,4.964285714285714
2118265,4,B0002SQO8C,"The series continues, with an episode that focuses
on the spiritual battle with no humans involved.
Very good, shows the ""end"" of pride and the reward
of humility.",1204070400,2,163,4.857142857142857
2118266,5,B0002SQO8C,Awesome exchange for violent meeaninless videos out there.  My son and all his frinds love this.  he played it at his academy and girls alike enjoyed this short video.  Good message to discuss with your kids - ck it out!!,1187827200,4,221,4.475
2118267,3,B0002SQO8C,"I must admit that I found these movies to be very enertaining and visually stunnning.  Good art work and good consept.  You now.. the spiritual battels and all... BUT I have my concerns when it comes to depicting accurate Biblical turths about demons and angels.  Like angels sinning or that the demons seem to MAKE the humans sin.  Also the lach of scripture.  I love the concept but if we remove God frome the piture, even a picture with angels in it, we bring God down and make him no more than a tool for human use not the Lord of all creation.

I urge Parents to deeply consider how these movies water down the truth and the implications that that may bring.",1179619200,3,663,4.349593495934959
2118268,5,B0002SQO8C,We used these cartoons in our church and our kids watch them constantly at home.  When we showed them they seemed to interest kids ages 4 to 13.  The music is awesome and the message is fantastic.  We highly recommend all three Angel Wars episodes and we hope they come out with more soon.,1175472000,3,289,4.314814814814815
2118269,4,B0002SQO8C,"Excellent DVD.  Perfect for the 8-12 year old boy especially although my 12 year old and 4 year old girl also loved it.

Only complaint is that it was too short.  A one hour story would be better.",1168387200,2,196,4.105263157894737
2118270,5,B0002SQO8C,"All three episodes should be in every DVD home (and public) library...in the world !  This is not an exaggeration.  These three titles are THAT good!  Clever, creative storylines that inspire, encourage, and embolden--AngelWars are more than a cartoon story taken from between the lines of Scripture, they are a unique ""behind the scenes"" look at the spiritual battle being waged day and night for the hearts and souls of all people.  If this sounds ""schultzy"",

than don't take my word for it--buy all three for yourself and see the ""other world"" that collective creative genius Team Angel Wars has created.  You will watch it again and again.

2118271,5,B0002SQO8C,"This was worth the wait, definitely their best yet.  Can't wait for the next one to come out!!!",1163116800,3,95,4.277777777777778
2118272,5,B0002SQO8C,"Boy, I tell you, if this is what we can expect from future all-CG animated movies or series, we're in for a treat.  This is the best CG animation since Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.  Each installment of Angel Wars seems to get better in the animation department.  The first one was good, this one is great.  At times, it doesn't even look like it's CG animated.  I'm talking about nearly photo-realistic scenes.

The sound is really good too.  It's only DD 2.0 but if you've got a 5-channel stereo setting on your receiver, I highly recommend that setting because it really brings out the bass and even at that, the dialogue is still crystal clear.

If you liked the first two installments, you'll love this one.",1159401600,7,718,4.5984251968503935
2118273,5,B0002SQO8C,"I saw a pre-screening of Episode 3 back in July and this movie looks to be another solid installment in the Angel Wars: Guardian Force series. It picks up shortly after the cliffhanger in episode 2, taking the entire battle-ready team into a dimensional underworld to rescue a fellow angel, retrieve a sacred artifact, and prevent a rapidly transforming demon from crossing over into the human plane.

The CG and overall production quality is once again first-rate, something you'd expect to see in a feature film rather than a values-based children's video. I have no doubts that my three kids, especially my 9-year old boy, will love this newest episode, and I also think that grown-up animation enthusiasts such as myself will also be pleased. The trademark anime-style of action is back with a slew of cool new bad-guys. Once again the heart-pounding action deftly underscores a positive message without getting preachy - that is what I always find so amazing about this series.

Imaginative, original, entertaining and inspiring - this series is outstanding. Hopefully we will not have to wait a whole year for the next installment.",1158105600,11,1137,5.042553191489362
2118274,4,B0002SQO8C,"Wow! I had seen the DVD on the shelf for weeks and thought it was just another weak,wanna be children's video. Boy was I wrong! This tape is packed with action, adventure, character building lessons and fun, fun, fun! But I wouldn't recommend it for children under 6 (maybe even 8)One last star would have been given for more scripturally accurate dialog. Over all, I'd buy the second one as well.",1155168000,4,397,4.605633802816901
2118275,5,B0002SQO8C,"Our kids (4 and 3) love this movie.  when we first received it they watched it four times.  lots of sword fighting action, good vs evil, our kids want to be guardian angels now!  AWESOME!!",1153785600,2,188,4.314285714285714
2118276,5,B0002SQO8C,"I am happy to see there is something that my kids can get into that is as entertaining as Superman, but has a layer of interesting moral themes. My 10-year old was especially fired up to think that his own decisions helped in a larger spiritual battle and that the heavens employs some pretty tough warriors to for him. The action was fun, but not really violent. You will see what i mean if you watch it.. it all seemed very implied. The car chase and angel/demon battle over the soul of a man consumed by vanity was intense to be sure, and the music added to the fun. Episode 2 was enjoyable as well, but i do think i prefer this first episode for its very human story. Episode 2 is my kids' favorite for the high energy action. Either way, Angel Wars is a winner.",1138579200,4,766,4.217687074829932
2118277,5,B0002SQO8C,"My children are 7 & 9 they love this movie. Keep in mind the word WARS is in the title....that denotes fighting. It's not gorey, it's defense against darkness, using force! Using your imagination you can find theology in the plot....just as you can with Chronicles of Narnia. I'd say it works for the 7 to 12 age range quite well.  My daughter loved the ""Learn to draw and Angel"" tutorial segment, she did quite well too! The cartoon also uses some contemporary Christian Music...the kids loved that they recognized the music too. Music videos are included in the bonus features...Mom liked that part!",1138320000,4,601,4.778846153846154
2118278,5,B0002SQO8C,"I have read some of the other reviews below and was quite suprised to find out that this is a Christian show. I bought it because i am a rabid anime fan always looking for something new. I think it will appeal to anyone who loves great animation and good stories no matter what their background. That being said, i do recognize the strong underlying positive messages as well as the theological references and i must say it was very well done. I know that neither i nor my kids like to be beaten over the head with a preachy moral lesson, but like any parent i want the entertainment for my family to be positive. This show hit the mark for me. Just checked out Episode 2 and it is even better!!",1125446400,10,695,4.2330827067669174
2118279,5,B0002SQO8C,"As a youth pastor, I was very impressed with Angel Wars abilty to capture the imagination of my students.  I think some people might be surprised by this product because it is not ""preachy,"" if I can quote one of my students.  There are some powerful themes in this episode which really help spur discussion in class.  If you're looking for overt strict theology, this isn't the product for you, this is more akin to Chronicles of Narnia life allegory than Peretti like evangelical fiction, but if you're looking for something that will engage kids, and inspire great discussion, I'd say give this a go.  (...)
Can't wait for episode 2!",1125360000,8,636,4.702702702702703
2118280,1,B0002SQO8C,"My seven year old said said that this wasn't a good movie for our church library since all it contains is fighting and very little (if any) Christian values. I agree, I watched to the end hoping for something redeemable.  There was nothing Christian about it except for the Christian rock musical accompaniment.",1125360000,3,311,4.867924528301887
2118281,5,B0002SQO8C,"Very good counter to superhero void, picking up where VeggieTales left off.  With parental reinforcement, this animated superhero style action packed storyline leads to excellent discusion on God's strength and the ever present dark 'angel'.  As with all cartoons, there is artistic additions, but very easily discussed and identified as additions to God's truths.  Example:  A school for angel training / trainees.  Again, not a huge roadblock, just an openning for discussion and spritual growth for both child and parent.",1125187200,8,524,5.5
2118282,5,B0002SQO8C,"Good all the way around.

The story actually has a plot and characterization.

Several good moral points are made.

The production values are surprisingly high.

Made for tweeners but younger kids love it also.",1120521600,4,210,5.088235294117647
2118283,5,B0002SQO8C,"I'm too thankful to the Good Lord for Angel Wars. To me, its theology is good, the storyline is entertaining, and it shows my kids just enough the reality of the spiritual realm - that we are watched over by our Guardian Angels, and we have our very important own part to play.
Almost inevitably, a certain amout of fighting actions are shown, as well as the uglyness of the dark side (the demons.) But I would call them just enough for the show to be entertaining - as well so that I as a father can help my children understand more about the conflicts going on in the seen and unseen worlds.
Yes, it would be a good idea to watch it together with your kids to provide guidance for, in particular, young children.
In future episodes, it'd be empowering to see even more contribution from the 'human' side to win a spiritual battle, and ultimately the War of Ages. E.g, refer to Frank Peretti's ""This Present Darkness"" and ""Piercing the Darkness."" We should do our part to pray fervently, make the right choices, honour the Lord, be humble, and all those good things.
It'd be interesting if Norman, the human character, will get to be more aware of the actions behind the scene, too. He seemed too ignorant in Episode 1 of what's going on around him, but maybe rightly so to start with.
FUNtastic job, brothers, and keep it up! You're in my prayers...!

2118284,3,B0002SQO8C,"The animation was well done and the portraying of a spiritual battle taking place and humans being unaware was also well done.  We were initially excited because we thought the film would offer a honest picture of Angels and their serving the Lord.

However, there seemed to be inaccurate Biblical references throughout (and I couldn't see where the added to the movie).  Ask yourself some questions and then reference the Bible....what caused Satan to fall from heaven?  What was the order of man and the Angels being created?  Are Angels both male and female?  When  being reprimanded for not watching the boy they were entrused while he steals candy an Angel says, ""It was only candy.""  There were more but you get the point.  Don't misunderstand; I don't have a problem adding a sci-fi piece to the movie (like the Angels use of technology) however, why change Biblical accounts for a movie's sake?",1106092800,22,902,4.8431372549019605
2118285,5,B0002SQO8C,"I'm not normally impressed with kids programming these days, but this is a gem. The storyline is solid and has kind of a ""This Present Darkness"" feel. Technically flawless, and truck loads of eye candy! DVD xtras include a tutorial on how to draw the characters by the lead animator. My son is 7 and daughter 2; they were really stoked after watching it! Great start for a new series!",1102723200,8,384,4.5
2118286,5,B0002SQO8C,Bottom line...the animation is fantastic and the story is fabulous.  People of all ages will have fun watching the visuals in this action packed adventure.  I welcome this new wave of super-heros fighting for us Mortals to do the right thing.  I can't wait to see more of the characters and how the story will unfold as the series develops.,1101427200,10,340,4.633333333333334
2118287,5,B0002SQO8C,"What an awesome movie suited for the whole family. I didn't know what to expect...my husband, son and I sat glued to the movie and the ending of this Part 1 epic, brought a tear to my eye to when they both looked at me and said, ""is it over, is there another one, when will the next one come out?"" Thanks!!! Can't wait till Part 2!. Keep up the great work.",1100563200,7,356,3.9583333333333335

8031440,5,B0002SQO8C,"As a child, I was lured to this amazing Christian bootleg CGI Super Sentai (Japanese Power Rangers ). Very creative with the idea of colour coded sci fi angels. Reminds me of Christian version of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in CGI.
The CGI is very realistic to the point that I even confused for a live action Film. Although the company is very small, it made its maximum efforts to replicate live action films with CGI.
The angels are ethnically diverse, making it less racist. The team had a black guy, three Caucasian guys, one being around my age, and two females, one Asian and a Latino, unlike stereotypical, white men dominant team (Japanese men in Super Sentai) in Power Rangers.
I really hope for a new instalment.
I really loved archangel Michael. As some sort of Jap-Caucasian guy, he legitimately defeated the forces of evil and he appears to be a photo realistic guy in the series",1490313600,,894,4.6645569620253164
