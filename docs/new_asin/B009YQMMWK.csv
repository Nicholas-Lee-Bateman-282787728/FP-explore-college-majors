5372685,2,B009YQMMWK,"I had wanted to like this movie but found it impossible to do so. Virtually everything about this was poorly done. The script is bad, the acting worse. The director should have had a GPS to find tension anywhere in this messy, lame attempt at a cop drama. Despite some excellent actors, in this effort they all appeared to have mailed in their performances. Weak is the best description I can give for every single part of this feeble film. Dreadfully slow pacing in a movie overloaded with cliche after cliche' had me wishing it would end as soon as possible but it kept going on and on to nowhere. How many times do you want to see an emotionally troubled cop with a drinking/drug/problem hanging out in a strip club, staring at a shot of whiskey while trying to not drink? You'll get your fill here if that's the sort of thing that passes for mystery or intrigue. For me it was painfully dull, slow, and lacking anything that made me care about any character at all in this snoozer. Everything in this movie has been done so much better so many times in so many other movies both recent and going back to old b&w films. This is a loser through and through. Nothing at all redeeming in this lackluster attempt at a cop drama.",1359590400,3,1227,4.409691629955947
5372686,3,B009YQMMWK,"Police corruption has become such a familiar theme and this story has a great twist, but it looks like they shot a lot more than they kept and there are too many, mystery time cuts, and not enough character development. Dorf is very good, but needed some other beats to make a complete performance",1359244800,,297,4.518518518518518

5372688,3,B009YQMMWK,"""Today is the day I die."" Detective Callahan (Dorff) is a good cop with a checkered past. While out protecting someone he gives chase and does what he has to do, when the person he is chasing turns out to be a cop he wonders what is going on. Things begin to become confusing to him and he is struggling to do his job and fall back into his old ways. This movie starts off very exciting and gripping and stays that way for about half the movie. Then it starts to slow down a little. I think the problem with this is that it is a really good idea for a TV show but when stretched out into a full length movie they have to drag some things out and that really hurts the pace of the movie. This is still worth watching though and keeps you interested for most of it. While not amazing this is still better then most of the movies like this that have come out. Overall, worth seeing but would have been better as a TV show like ""Blue Bloods"" or ""NYPD Blue"". I give it a B.",1358812800,4,968,3.9948453608247423
5372689,3,B009YQMMWK,"The basic premise of this story is a corrupt cop ,Stephen Dorff (Immortals, Blade)has a chance at redemption when he is shot after a pulling over a couple of suspicious looking gang bangers in a red mustang. A stranger steps in ,drives away the bangers and saves his life by calling an ambulance and then promptly disappears. This person's identity is never discovered even after David Callahan (Dorff) begs him to come forward as our alcoholic,cocaine addicted detective becomes quite the local hero.
It is now one year later and David has cleaned up his act when the stranger mysteriously appears with his dead daughter's diary. In it is information on how she payed for her tuition by stripping at a club which has more illegal goings on than you can imagine. This is where the story, really starts, as David reads the journal late at night,starts his own investigation on the side,and of course absolutely NOTHING is as it seems.
This film has a brilliant cast Stephen Lang (Avatar)as David's superior,David Boreanas (Bones,Angel)as a fellow detective, James Woods as the chief,Dominic Purcell (Prison Break,Blade 3) as the night club owner ,Elizabeth Rohm (Law and Order,Angel)as his wife and Walton Goggins (Justified,Predators)as one of the suspects not to leave out AnnaLynne McCord (90210) and Soulia Boy as one of the bangers.
As my title suggests this film with better pacing could have been so much better. When what ACTUALLY happened and people are revealed for who they REALLY are ,I found the story to be quite clever. The problem is it takes ,soooo long to get there and instead of revealing little tidbits along the way things start to unfold very quickly. The last half hour had my full attention but I found it a little slow up until then. Don't get me wrong though, it's still well worth a look. I find Stephen Dorff always very watchable. Check it out for yourself. See what you think.",1357776000,27,1906,4.8318042813455655
5372690,3,B009YQMMWK,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi

Detective David Callahan (Stephen Dorff) knows crime from the inside out.
He used to be the best customer at the local strip club, addicted to booze, drugs and the ladies.
The problem he was a cop.
So one night he stops another car, not to arrest them but to steal their stash of narcotics. Instead he's shot. A stranger comes to his aid and calls 911. The stranger is gone before he can thank him, but David is now a changed man.
A doctor and security guard dream at night. They dream what the other person did during the day. They meet when the security guard murders his wife, is then hit by a car and brought into the doctor's emergency room. The case fasinates David. He's been waiting for a chance to solve a tough case, and get back in the game.
Meanwhile, the stranger comes forward. David wants to repay him somehow for giving him his life back. The stranger is seeking revenge against some unknown men who have assaulted his daughter and other young women at the same strip club David used to frequent.
This is cool cop movie with a really great cast including Dominic Purcell (Prison Break), Stephen Lang (Terra Nova), AnnaLynne McCord (Gun), James Woods (Northfork), David Boreanaz (Bones), Walton Goggins (Justified), and Souljaboy (Juice).
You probably didn't know, Dorff attended several private schools, and was expelled from five of them.",1357776000,5,1421,4.776422764227642
5372701,3,B009YQMMWK,"It's ok. I like Dorff so I gave it a try, but I wouldn't really ""recommend"" to anyone. If it's free I'd say give it a shot, but not if you have to pay like I did.",1426291200,,162,3.4054054054054053

5372710,3,B009YQMMWK,"This movie does present a lot of social issues which most people prefer not to think about, sex trafficking, drug addiction, dirty officers, what some folks do to pay their way through college in America, adultery, etc. What happens when all these things cross one person's life? How will it affect not only the people themselves but how does it affect those who witness it? my two biggest complaints are that the acting is far from stellar by any stretch of the imagination and my second complaint is that this movie tries to cover too much in 90 minutes. But if you like confusion, then this is the movie for you because there are plenty of twist and turns but all of them do not make sense. But this is clearly about bad circumstances becoming worse circumstances.",1408838400,,767,4.605839416058394

5372713,1,B009YQMMWK,"I love Cop movies like Bad Lieutenant,  so considering the title & the fact that it was $19.99 @ Best buy,  I was expecting this to be a good one. This movie started off good,  but quickly made a turn for the worse.  Simply put,  it did not live up to my expectations.  Slow. .. Blah, boring.",1371427200,,292,4.035087719298246
5372714,3,B009YQMMWK,"This was a pretty good film to spend time watching.  It was no Bullitt or We Own the Night, but it was good enough to keep me very interested right up to the end.

5372719,2,B009YQMMWK,"This is a typical ""dirty cop"" movie, with nothing to recommend it.  (In some review somewhere, I saw this movie labeled ""paranormal"" but in no way is this the case.) For James Woods fans:  he is in maybe 15 minutes of the movie, at most.  For David Boreanaz fans, he is in about 6 minutes of the movie at most.  And DB's character is nothing more than a foul-mouthed Booth.  Pass up this movie.",1364169600,,394,4.27027027027027

5372731,3,B009YQMMWK,"This is much darker movie than I expected and sometimes it was a bit hard to follow and some scenes just distracted from the story. There was a huge under use of several of the supporting characters which could have made this a more character and plot driven story as opposed to just the one point of view that was often shrouded by flashbacks. For me, it was disappointing.",1362700800,,374,4.434782608695652
5372732,4,B009YQMMWK,"As usual Mr. Doriff knows how to pick his scripts and of course remains a really good actor. The movie is full of both action and angst and a story of redemption and recovery. Though the plot wanders a bit it doesnt detract from the overall quality of the film. It is highly enjoyable and though I just rented it I would not hesitate to purchase the DVD/Blu Ray.
I am still waiting to see a movie with Mr. Doriff in it that isn't worth watching. Incredible how some actors have an uncanny ability to choose good scripts to commit their talent to.
I do very much recommend this movie!",1362528000,,583,4.3090909090909095

5372734,3,B009YQMMWK,"and it is. Stephen Dorff plays a recalcitrant but ultimately principled cop who struggles with a corrupt precinct captain and work-related alienation from his wife and daughter. He also becomes entangled with his fellow officers, the owner of a strip club he used to frequent, the owner's Russian mafia cohorts, and one of the dancers.

The script is hackneyed, reveal-all, and larger-than-life, and the acting is quite so-so. Still, there is a long string of interesting (though improbable) threads and some good surprises. I like the ending.",1362268800,,543,5.241379310344827

The sentences for the men at the end are too light and should have reflected what is wrong with our justice system.  I really enjoyed the movie and thought the actors did a good enough job to get the meaning of this film across.  Bad cops don't usually last too long.",1508112000,,421,4.428571428571429
