7932638,4,B000056V7H,"One the last DVD, Momiji Fujiyama discovered that she had inherited the title of Princess Kushinada from a twin sister she had never met.  This plummeted her into a running battle with all kind of spirit evils (Arigami) that are manifestations of small ceramic-like things that are he 'blue seeds' of the series title.  Her friends in these escapades are Mamoro Kusanagi (an Arigami dedicated to protecting the Kushinada) and the TAC team or anti-Arigami specialists.
In this DVD, two new major characters are introduced.  The first Sakura Yamazaki, a faith healer, Arigami hunter and would be Idol singer.  She greatly resents the attention Momiji is getting, referring to her all the time as 'sacrifice girl.'  She is not very effective and tends to cause more trouble than she solves - 'with friends like these.'  The other new character is Murakomo, an Arigami more powerful than Kusanagi who is trying to resurrect the Susano-oh, the god of the Arigami.
The relationship that does not quite develop between Momiji and Kusanagi is the focus of these episodes, and a source of much of the comic energy.  It is almost as if the monsters appear and play out their roles against the background of Momiji's quest for her guardian's love.  This is complicated by his feelings for her missing sister, Kaede.  Another case of a serious theme buried in comic byplay. At least the dubbing is a bit closer to the Japanese and the subtitles, although this is one of those cases where I am not sure if this is an improvement.
This continues to be a problematic series, having difficulty balancing the serious primary theme (the sacrifice of a young woman) against the largely comic antics of the characters.  On the one hand, we have escalating monsters, the rebirth of some mysterious Arigami evil, and general destruction and havoc.  On the other, we have actors who literally careen around the video screen, doing pratfalls, generally running riot over each other, and horrible puns that are a bit out of place.  Entertaining, but there is an unresolved inner conflict between serious and comic that hampers development.",1049155200,,2114,4.940677966101695
7932639,4,B000056V7H,"Any fan of the Blue Series should definately get the DVD over the VHS.  Volume one contains episodes 8-14, and includes both the Japanese w/ subtitle and English Dubbed versions of the show!  Considering single episodes on VHS are the same price, you just can't do wrong with the Blue Seed DVD.",1020816000,2,294,4.634615384615385
7932640,5,B000056V7H,"I bought this DVD and the rest of them too... If you like adventure and a little romance this one is for you.  IT's pretty much about this sacrafice girl, Momeigi .  Who has to over come her fears of the enemy her twin sister Kadi the plant like creatures the Aragami.  But her bigges problem has to be her underware.  Don't worry this is not one of thoughs icky rape the innocent girl animes. this one has it's bloody parts, but they are pretty breif.  You can listen to this DVD in both English or Jap.  When in Jap. you can here the ledgendary Magumi.  The main reason to buy this DVD is the the Omake theatres.  They are in the extra part of the DVD. And they are worth buying alone.",1006300800,2,687,4.112781954887218
7932641,5,B000056V7H,"This anime is a must have for all sci-fi horror anime fans, with amazing characters and beautiful animation.  Like most anime dvds if you are a fan of the subbed or dupped this has both.  The feautres on the Blue Seed dvds also leave most anime dvds in the dust, with little animation shorts, trailers, and more.  This second chapter of Blue Seed introduces alot of crucial characters and of course more of those darn Aragomi.  You also get to know and love Kusanagi, his limitations, and the TAC, and their pasts, alot more.  With all that i assure you that this will be one dvd you have to have for your collection.",986342400,4,617,4.424778761061947
