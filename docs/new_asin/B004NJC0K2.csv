8436749,4,B004NJC0K2,"Judge David Johnson, DVD Verdict- The 60-minute documentary examines the complex conservation efforts that include something called Juvenile Fish Transportation as well as the salmon version of in-vitro fertilization. Pulling back, we also see how it is necessary for the habitat to have a viable salmon population. It's a nice package and certainly educational; I learned much about a fish that I knew very little about, except the standard-issue ""swimming in the opposite direction"" stuff. Most stunning was the material looking at the decades of failed attempts to save the fish that backfired. Yikes.

A no-frills Blu-ray that accomplishes what it needs to in the tech department: the 1.85:1, 1080i transfer may fall a degree or two short for purists, but it looks great, clean and crisp, especially when it handles the underwater salmon scenes. The orthodox Dolby Digital 5.1 surround mix pushes dialogue and little else. No extras.
