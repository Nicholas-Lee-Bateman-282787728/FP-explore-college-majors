8373082,1,B002LH42J0,"This show was ludicrous: Psychic, David Mcready sits on the interviewers set, and mumbles a bunch of psychobabble that is very obviously either made up, or coming from a delusional place in his mind. He never gives the interviewer a straight answer and seems lost when questioned. It's as if he never expected anyone to ever ask a logical/honest question about his so-called psychic experiences. Even the interviewer laughs often, shakes his head and says things like, ""that doesn't make any sense."" This video will not tell you how to become psychic; but it will prove that the guy being interviewed is a sham. It's guys like this that give the legitimate psychics a bad name. I don't know who in their right mind would ever believe David McCready and his disjointed, illogicalgical nonsense.",1429574400,3,793,4.925373134328358
8373083,1,B002LH42J0,"I didn't expect to become psychic instantly. In fact I didn't expect to become psychic at all. But this video doesn't even try to teach anyone how to become psychic. It's just two episodes of two different new age talk shows, both of which are boring, and neither of which instruct anyone in how to be a psychic.

This is a cheap attempt to make a quick buck on two cancelled TV shows. I got ripped off. Don't buy this or anything from World Wide Multi Media, (WWMM). I want my money back.",1303344000,8,489,4.258064516129032
