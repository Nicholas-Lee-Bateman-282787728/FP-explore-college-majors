2615970,5,B000GRTRAG,"I've been waiting for this DVD for a while, but I didn't get it until this week. Tye and GA were in DC last week, and I went to see them. I was so hyped when I left that I had to get the DVD right away.  This group is truly anointing and their message is so clear. I love their energy, their voice, and their zeal for God. It was definitely sad to see that Kenny (RIP) was not up there with him, but he's singing in the heavenly choir now.

The guys in the group are my faves. They do so much moving around...makes me tired to watch, but it's incredible to see. The ladies have lovely voices as well.

What a time, what a time this show was!!  I'm glad I went to see them before I got the DVD b/c then I would have been feigning for them to come here!! LOL!!

You cannot go wrong w/this concert!",1160179200,3,795,3.882716049382716
2615971,5,B000GRTRAG,"After viewing this dvd, All I could say is ""Wow""!!!  The energy, the praise, the worship.  Just phenomenal!!!  Only one thing though, according to recaps that I read at Gospelflava, Donnie Mcclurkin and MaryMary helped joined in on a one of the songs.  I was hoping to see them on her as well.  However, Tye and G.A. held it down still, and have Kim Burrell on the dvd was still awesome.  If you don't have this one yet, you need to get on it!!!  This is an must have for all Tye and G.A. fans, or if you just wanna get yo praise and worship on in a different.  Buy the DVD!!!  you'll be glad ya did.",1159315200,6,600,4.05982905982906
2615972,5,B000GRTRAG,"Listen - this DVD is SIMPLY SICK!!!

If you can sit through this DVD all the way through and not jump out of your seat at least once, I have no idea what is wrong with you....

YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!",1193011200,2,206,3.880952380952381
2615973,5,B000GRTRAG,This is one of the best Live Performances that I have seen in a long time.  You know you love it when you're about to be late to a final trying the see the whole thing in one sitting :),1179273600,,185,3.625
2615974,5,B000GRTRAG,"I have seen gospel video's before, but this one...Oh my God!  Powerful, spiritual,truly anointed by God.  This group as more energy than the law allows.  I purchased 3 dvd's and the individuals I gave them to were blown away with not just the high energy of group but the fact the all the music was solid gospel(which is the good news of Jesus Christ).  Tye Tribbett took gospel to another level, reaching every genre of music possible. This collection takes you from a rock concert all the way to Sunday morning service.

Loved it, Loved it, Loved it!!!!!",1169078400,,556,4.63265306122449
2615975,5,B000GRTRAG,If you aint got it get it. This DVD is for old and young souls alike. If you like to get ya praise on this is the DVD for you.,1168473600,,126,3.2333333333333334
2615976,5,B000GRTRAG,"Awesome is only just one of the words to use. There's so many, but it's rather hard to describe the hand of God. This is good to watch while facing trials and troubles. By the time you end this video you'll forget what you were facing. It ends like every battle you let the Lord handle. With VICTORY!!!!!!!!",1168300800,,307,4.310344827586207
2615977,5,B000GRTRAG,"God is using Tye to change lives. This album is on point, from the lyrics to the music.. It's a must have.",1168300800,,106,3.8636363636363638
2615978,5,B000GRTRAG,"If you are looking for a high energy Gospel Concert, look no more. This DVD is the one for you. The singers are truely talented and spirited. The young people would agree this concert would be highly reccomended. Tye Tribbett, the lead singer, is taking Gospel music to a new level. This DVD would make a nice present for all ages.",1167782400,2,331,4.442622950819672
2615979,5,B000GRTRAG,I purchased this about a month ago and finally watched it. I love the freedom of worship. I do have one fault... the over-dubbing could have been better. But other than that... i would watch this over n over.,1167436800,,208,4.358974358974359
2615980,5,B000GRTRAG,"This DVD is one of the best live gospel concert DVD's I've ever seen.  It is also addictive. I really appreciate Tye's energy and creativity.  He didn't have to hire extra ""praise dancers"" and add pyrotechnics in order to perform.  Also I am impressed by how the dances were not just a replica of what we see on BET nightly now done to a song with Jesus stuck somewhere in it.  The dances were primarily original.  Finally, as a church musician, I love how he has revolutionized traditional ""shouting"" music.  Unlike some other contemporary artists, Tye is radical without being rebellious.",1164672000,2,590,4.792079207920792
2615981,5,B000GRTRAG,"Better to see it...this DVD is full of energy and praise.  I was only disappointed because Seated at the Right Hand of God wasn't on it, but I can't give it anything else but 5 stars...",1160784000,2,185,4.138888888888889

8133951,5,B000GRTRAG,"Every morning, after I bathe, dress, and feed my two daughters, we watch Tye Tribbett's ""Victory Live"" DVD for about 20 minutes, then we leave for day care.

The energy is amazing! I want my girls to know that praising God can be done enthusiastically (God knows they won't see it at the church we go to).

One thing to know: Although a more ""conservative"" viewer may be put off by the jumping around and dancing,the music and lyrics of the songs on this DVD are actually quite traditional--as Tye and GA would put it, ""it's Kingdom music.""",1291680000,,540,4.5
8133952,5,B000GRTRAG,"My boyfriend has this playing at his place one Sunday after we got out of church and I throughly enjoyed it. I asked him where he'd bought it and he said that he rented it from blockbuster. I went home and ordered me one, him one and by best friend one from Amazon. He was pleasantly surprised when he received his copy and I can't stop watching mine. Mt best friend said that she let her friend hold it because she's going through something right now that this DVD may help her get through. Tye is energetic, passionate and annointed. I HIGHLY, HIGHLY, HIGHLY recommend this to anyone who loves to worship Jesus. *Singing* I had no other choice but to trust yooooou, that's all I could do. I had no other choice but to belieeeeeeve. This is ""feel good"" music, yall!",1250467200,2,766,4.401408450704225
8133953,2,B000GRTRAG,"After waiting patiently for the DVD to arrive after listening to the CD time and time again.  I was a little disappointed in the production and the obvious lip syncing from the choir.  In my opinion, they move around way too much on every song, including praise and worship.  If you have seen Kirk Franklin's ""Rebirth"" Video then this will disappoint you when you compare the two.  The music is excellent!  The performance, unimpressive!  That's my two cents. -Pax-",1238976000,,465,4.822784810126582
8133954,5,B000GRTRAG,I love this DVD. It is marvelous with high energy. I ordered an additional 2 for other family members. This DVD was more than I expected.,1207353600,,137,4.3076923076923075
8133955,1,B000GRTRAG,VICTORY WAS A GREAT PERFORMANCE ABOUT THREE SONGS WORTH WATCHING THE DVD WAS NOT WORTH PURCHASING I WISH I HAS A SEAL-O-MEAL.IT WAS TOTALLY OVER RATED IN MY OPINION.,1196380800,,165,4.724137931034483
