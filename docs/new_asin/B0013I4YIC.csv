8251079,3,B0013I4YIC,"Because this video is about Lesley Gore, I gave it three stars. Otherwise, I learned nothing new from the program. The interviewer talked too much and didn't give Lesley a chance to expand on many topics.  If you don't know very much about Lesley's career, buy this; otherwise, let it go.",1384387200,,288,4.647058823529412

8251081,5,B0013I4YIC,"I think I could have edited the video on this better on my Mac Mini using iMovie and iDVD, but that's merely a quibble. The interview is thorough and extremely interesting. Lesley is charming and funny, and gives us a lot of interesting bits of information about her career over the years. Anyone who's a Lesley Gore fan needs this in their collection. By far one of the best one-on-ones with her I've ever seen. And if you ever get a chance to see her live these days, well, she really is better than ever, and she goes beyond just nostalgia. Yeah, you'll hear her hits, but you'll be amazed at how she tackles songs by John Lennon and even Cold Play! Lesley's my gal!",1273968000,6,669,4.36
8251082,3,B0013I4YIC,"This was a great interview DVD with Leslie Gore done a few years ago.  She still has a great voice.  One issue is that they did not include any of her songs all the way through -- just ""snippets""!  They should have included several of her top hits (complete), and several live songs from her latest tours!",1218931200,7,305,4.315789473684211
8251083,5,B0013I4YIC,"Very enjoyable and thorough interview with the legendary Lesley Gore, covering her entire career in great detail up to the recording of her current project, the superb ""Ever Since"" CD.  Lots of rare photos and clips, and a well thought out series of questions, giving Gore a chance to expound on some areas and debunk commonly held ideas about others.  She comes across as warm, funny and thoughtful and the visit is fascinating throughout.  Highly recommended not just for Lesley Gore fans but for students of popular music of the past 40 plus years.  Gore was there and she's got stories to tell.",1212278400,12,598,4.776699029126213
