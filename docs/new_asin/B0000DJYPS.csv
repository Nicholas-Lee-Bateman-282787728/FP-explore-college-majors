8001379,1,B0000DJYPS,This DVD is nothing but trailers. Once again you the customer are falsely lead to believe this is an actual true film collection with Gregory Peck. Do not buy this unless you are trying to buy everything to do with Gregory Peck for a museum. Otherwise this is a waste of time and money. Read carefully and you will see this is just trailers. They just did not call it Gregory Peck Trailer Collection.,1189555200,,400,4.418918918918919
8001380,3,B0000DJYPS,"Not what I had hoped it was - a feature film I was looking for - but a nice collection of Trailers from films starring Gregory Peck.  Let this be a lesson to you.  Always read the description thoroughly before checking out your shopping cart.  But Peck was a great film star, and this is a good addition to the collection of any fan.",1175990400,3,333,4.171875
8001381,1,B0000DJYPS,Not at all what I thought I was getting.  I thought I was getting the movies - instead got trailers.  At least I paid a lot less than the price now advertised.  Lets see how the refund goes.,1150675200,22,190,3.9473684210526314
8001382,1,B0000DJYPS,"Had no idea it was just going to be trailers from the movies.

Very unhappy with my purchase.",1140134400,50,93,4.166666666666667
8001383,1,B0000DJYPS,"I searched for the film title ""Mirage"" and this Gregory Peck DVD came up.  I was delighted to apparently find a copy of this execllent thriller and didn't bother to read the reviews since I already knew I liked the movie. This DVD does not have ""Mirage"" or any other movie; it is a compliation of theatrical trailers!!!",1138579200,38,319,4.5
8001384,3,B0000DJYPS,"Can not review or order as the Titles of the films are not mentioned. This is a recurring faux pas/omission on your website Even in case of the Great Western series- where the titles of the films are not mentioned in each volume. To avoid duplication in personal collection, the titles have to be mentioned.
Please address the problem & rectify the deficiency in info.
