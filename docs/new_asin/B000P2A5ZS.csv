8188572,4,B000P2A5ZS,"A necessary epilogue to Mr Arnold's autobiographical novel ""Kohn's  War"" ( aka Doorknob five-two"") . This film shows Mr. Armold tring to reach out to survivors of his flight class 42J or their surviving family.

We learn that Mr Armold initially drafted his book as a therapeutic exercise to address his own feelings about his war experience and possible Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). It was interesting to see Mr Armold with the family of his classmates and his expression
of grief and mourning so many years after the experiences of war.

Read the book then see this documentary .",1433721600,,591,4.89
8188573,5,B000P2A5ZS,"I wish this documentary could have wider distribution. Important tribute to some brave fighter pilots, tenderly told by award winning director Aaron Weisblatt and the last surviving member of the Class of 42J, Fredric Arnold. Viewers might also like to read Mr. Arnold's book, ""Doorknob Five Two"" (aka ""Kohn's War"").",1392422400,,316,5.34

Thanks Mr. Arnold for your service and for sharing this with us.
 I salute you all.",1310169600,,160,4.517241379310345
8188575,5,B000P2A5ZS,"Between Two Worlds is a documentary different from anything I have ever

seen.  It tells of the personal terror of one who, against tremendous

odds, makes it through such an ordeal of war, while so many more don't

make it through the terror, and tells of how it continues to erode

one's mind, life, and spirit, even for a very strong person, who seems

to have ""made it."" It is important for all people to understand the consternation, terror,

and feelings of guilt experienced by our armed forces, whom the United

States sends out to ""do a job.""  It should make us, and especially our

political leaders, very cautious about what we send our soldiers out to

do, and why.  And when there are truly compelling reasons for sending

our citizens to face the terror in other parts of the world, we need to

make plentifully available personal help for each soldier and their

family, on arriving back home, as Mr. Arnold received only very long years

after returning. This film is one more step, encouraging the

world to stop the senseless pain that individuals and governments

inflict on countless people.

8188576,5,B000P2A5ZS,"Academy Award nominee Aaron Weisblatt has crafted a powerful, compelling doc about artist and P-38 ace Fred Arnold and his personal mission to honor the fallen flyboys who were his comrades in WWII. Saw it at a Universal Studios screening where it got a standing ovation and immediately ordered 6 copies of the DVD to share with our parents and several veterans of Arnold's generation. It meant a lot to them. Humanistic, sometimes shocking, very moving and a wonderful tribute to all the young American airmen who volunteered to do battle with the Luftwaffe in 1942 and did not live to tell about it. Weisblatt and Arnold do their story proud.
