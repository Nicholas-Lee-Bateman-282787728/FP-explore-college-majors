8639315,3,B00I53BA80,"I love Jerry Yarnell's shows!! I purchased this DVD in the hopes that I would learn some basic information.. The information that was on the DVD was helpful.  However, it was incomplete in my estimation.  The information on composition covered only two designs rather than all those I had previously heard about.  While the information on how to stretch a canvas was interesting, I would rather have had the color schemes covered and more about composition.  I was disappointed.  I will continue to watch his shows.  I will be less enthusiastic than I might have been to buy another DVD.",1423872000,3,587,4.82
