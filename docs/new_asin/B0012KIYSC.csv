BE BIG (1931)- Ollie feigns illness to get out of a family vacation so he and Stan can go to a stag party being hosted by their lodge. Their plans are hindered, however, when Ollie accidentally puts on Stan's boot and can't get it off.

PERFECT DAY (1929)- It's a beautiful Sunday morning. The boys and their wives climb in their old Model T Ford for a lovely picnic in the park. What could possibly go wrong? Answer: everything.

NIGHT OWLS (1930)- Bumbling Police Officer Kennedy has failed to halt 42 burglaries in his neighborhood, and the chief warns him that if one more goes unresolved, he was fired. Desperate, he acquires the aid of two vagrants, Stan and Ollie, to stage a robbery.

HELPMATES (1932)- What a party, Hardy. Ollie's house is a mess and his wife would be home from Chicago that very afternoon. He quickly enlists the help of Stan to clean the house.

My favorite in this collection is Helpmates. One of their all-time masterpieces. While Be Big is okay, it's not one of my favorites. It just seems sorely lacking. It's just built around an entire skit of removing a boot.
But do check these out if you can. With Laurel and Hardy, you cannot go wrong!",1275609600,7,1312,4.518987341772152
