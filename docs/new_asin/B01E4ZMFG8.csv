THIS IS NOT A TEST is a nearly obscure 'B' grade Atomic Age frighter with a script that would make Rod Serling proud.

Here, a small number of motorists stopped on a mountain road by a 4 AM roadblock learn that a nuclear attack is imminent. They huddle in a big rig trailer and pray for survival. It doesn't end happily.

This chilling story has time to explore the reactions of individual humans to what appears to be the approaching end of their lives. Behaviors are as different as fingerprints. The avaricious worry about money and possessions, the kind-hearted show concern only for others, and the cowardly don't muster any deep-down courage. Seamon Glass as the no-nonsense state trooper takes a page out of Robert Ryan's playbook. He's cold, stentorian and somewhat wooden while trying to maintain order during a monumental crisis.

In preparing their flimsy trailer for fallout shelter duty, hard life-or-death decisions must be made, yet in the end these may all just be distracting ways of avoiding the unspeakable, that tomorrow may not come for any of them.

A definite must-see!
