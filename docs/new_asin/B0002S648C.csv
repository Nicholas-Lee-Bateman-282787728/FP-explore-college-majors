2116937,5,B0002S648C,I'm not a native speaker but I understood perfecty well the film and had a wonderful time watching it. I gave myself a treat with it and I hope to buy more movies of the same kind because I have become a fanatic.,1155686400,18,212,3.953488372093023
2116938,5,B0002S648C,"I liked this set so much, I bought it twice -- once for me and once for a friend!!!  The actors are all very engaging.  I would say that the costumes had a staring role -- absolutely beautiful.  Susan Hampshire is very lovely and carries the piece.  Also you get a very early performance from Jeremy Irons.  It is everything a period drama should be.  I haven't read the books yet, but I've certainly put them on my list.",1142812800,26,421,4.265822784810126
2116939,5,B0002S648C,"The entire collection is marvelous viewing, the actors are superb, the period costumes and sets are beautiful to look at.  Most of all Susuan Hampshire is amazing and classy as Lady Glencora (the Duchess of Omnium & Gatherum),she brings such life to any character she portrays. Barbara Murray (Mrs. Finn)is beautiful and very classy too.  You grow to love Philip Latham (the Duke of Omnium & Gatherum)too, The entire cast are really excellent.  I enjoyed watching several times over the years and still do watch it occasionally.",1117497600,77,528,5.045977011494253
2116940,5,B0002S648C,"The Pallisers is a 1974 BBC production based on Anthony Trollope's six-volume series of novels which takes place in the mid to late 1800s and covers more than 20 years. Where Trollope's Barchester series revolves around the church, his Palliser series revolves around the world of politics. Throughout the course of the series, one gains some familiarity with the political issues of the time--issues such as Irish tenant rights, the implementation of secret ballots, the abolition of rotten boroughs, the decimalization of the currency, and so on. If you're not particularly interested in politics or political history, you needn't worry, for the issues are not the focal point of the series. The show is primarily about individuals, their relationships with one another, and the scandals and intrigues that arise--we're even treated along the way to a murder and the ensuing court case.

The series primarily follows the lives of wealthy Plantagenet Palliser (Philip Latham), a Member of Parliament for the Liberal Party, the heir to a dukedom, and a very serious, conscientious, and morally upright gentleman; and the beautiful, spirited, and wealthy Lady Glencora (Susan Hampshire (The Barchester Chronicles, The Forsyte Saga, The First Churchills, The Grand, The Monarch of the Glen))--a young woman who, as the story opens, is head over heels in love with an avaricious but charismatic gambler, but whose hand is destined (if her guardian has her way) for Plantagenet.

I might just mention that each novel is an independent entity, and one can usually tell when one has reached the end of the dramatisation of each one, for there is a sense of closure to that particular story and we often see no more of individuals who were introduced for that story. Having said that, a couple of characters worth mentioning are the new, cash-strapped Irish MP Phineas Finn (Donal McCann), and Madame Max (Barbara Murray), a shrewd, resourceful and wealthy Austrian, both of whom feature prominently throughout much of the series.

The series consists of twenty-six 50-minute episodes, and one ought not to expect a slick production like those one has come to expect of 90's efforts. The production is very well done, but it is done according to 1970's standards. In other words, if you're familiar with Upstairs Downstairs, The Duchess of Duke Street, Lillie, and other 70's productions, you can expect the same sort of look and feel here. The only complaint I have (and it's a minor one) concerns the first episode or two which, unfortunately, appear to have been either overexposed or overdeveloped.

In short, this is a splendid period drama punctuated with plenty of comic relief, seasoned with a memorable cast of characters, and consummately acted by an all-star British cast. To name but a few: a bewhiskered Derek Jacobi (I Claudius, Cadfael) plays Lord Fawn, a cash-strapped man who has no luck with women. Penelope Keith (To the Manor Born, Good Neighbours) briefly appears in a few episodes as Fawn's domineering sister (just the type of character at which she excels!). Peter Sallis (Last of the Summer Wine's Norman Clegg) portrays the surly, unpleasant Mr. Bonteen. Anthony Andrews (Brideshead Revisited) appears in the later episodes as a grown-up Silverbridge, the Duke's eldest son, with Jeremy Irons (also Brideshead Revisited) as Frank Tregear, Silverbridge's best friend.

I highly recommend this captivating, intelligent, and all around enjoyable series (which I for one had never seen before). If you enjoy period drama, it's a safe bet that you'll soon find yourself hooked on this one--our family certainly was!",1102982400,255,3629,5.175468483816013
2116941,5,B0002S648C,"This set of DVDs encompasses six of Anthony Trollope's books.  However, it is very much a television phenomenon - lavish costumes, beautiful sets, and superb acting.  Several disparate stories are held together by the lives of Glencora Palliser and her husband Plantagenet.  Although 30 years old, the film has held up extremely well, it looks marvellous.  The dialog has not dated at all, the acting is fresh and the directing seamless.  I noticed a couple of rather poor backdrops purporting to be out of doors, and merely two wobbles of scenery in the nearly twenty hours of viewing.  However, you watch this for the stories, which are entrancing, and which are ably supported by a matchless cast of characters.  The acting is flawless - I cannot praise it too highly, and the costumes are a delight.  The DVD contains an interesting interview with the lovely Susan Hampshire, from 2000, with many insights into the making of the series.  They don't make them like this any more.",1101859200,121,982,4.867469879518072
2116942,4,B0002S648C,"Good series.  All six books by Trollope (the Palliser series) covered here, with Plantagenet and Glencora Palliser as the central characters. Good follow-up to the books, and good entertainment otherwise.",1409875200,,204,5.8
2116943,5,B0002S648C,Invest the time it takes to watch every episode in this series and you will be rewarded with an entrance into the complex social web of nineteenth British society and politics as envisioned by Anthony Trollope.  Delightful in every respect!,1407024000,,240,5.0

2116945,4,B0002S648C,"I love the stories and feel part of the families. The only problem is that it does not have subtitles which I need. The English speaking is not always clear to us, elderly Americans. I will watch it many times.",1405641600,,210,4.275
2116946,3,B0002S648C,This drama wouldn't have been interesting at all if it weren't for the fabulous Susan Hampshire.  She carried it off but the story is not interesting.  Many other PBS dramas have been much better.,1403913600,,196,4.735294117647059
2116947,5,B0002S648C,"Having read and enjoyed all the novels and missed it on TV first time around, I loved this.  Of course there are slight changes/omissions from the books, but this is bound to happen in almost any adaptation to the screen and it happens a lot less in this than in many.  The storylines are very varied - everything from a virtually 'forced' marriage and political shenanigans, to a scheming little trollop, debt and murder.

I have given this as a present twice, and the recipients have also loved it. My husband ditto!  Highly recommended for long winter evenings, since there are umpteen episodes, but don't start watching it if you have urgent stuff to do.  It probably won't get done.",1403913600,,687,4.691666666666666
2116948,5,B0002S648C,"you are so taken back into another time and place.  the characters become like family---and they fight, cry, loose, and fall in love. the central love story begins with an arranged marriage forced on both the groom and bride.  the rest of the story is how they found love--true love with respect and loyal to each other.  plenty of other character that you both love and hate.",1392940800,,376,4.582089552238806
2116949,5,B0002S648C,This is from the early beginnings of public TV.  It is an elaborate costume soap opera that will appeal to mystery lovers as well.,1392681600,,130,4.416666666666667
2116950,5,B0002S648C,Enjoyed this.  this filled many a night after recovering from surgery as especially since I did not have t.v. service.,1386547200,,118,4.9
2116951,4,B0002S648C,"I bought this for research, and when I first started watching, I was disappointed. I found the main characters annoying. But as the series progressed, a number of characters emerged that I really liked and enjoyed seeing their stories evolve. Jeremy Irons, Anthony Edwards apparently either made their debuts in this series or were still new to acting as their acting has matured greatly since this series was made in the late 70s. The fashions are beautiful and the overall ambiance with the houses and carriages, etc are awesome. It's not all that well researched, but good fun if you're willing to overlook some of the inaccuracies in the production.",1384214400,,653,4.945454545454545
2116952,5,B0002S648C,"This series is an older series, perhaps the costuming is a bit more elegant, but I truly do enjoy Susan Hampshire's character.",1382140800,,126,4.7727272727272725
2116953,3,B0002S648C,"For fans of Anthony Trollope (and there seem to be a lot of us, existing in the shadows like aliens banished to this odd planet), this series is a must have because it covers a lot of ground.  The production values are somewhat dated, and the acting is a bit strained, but it stands up pretty well.  It's not as good, all in all, as the Barchester Chronicles (which is worth having for Nigel Hawthorne's performance alone) nor The Way We Live Now.  But it's worth buying (if it doesn't cost you an arm and a leg) anyway.",1382054400,,520,4.285714285714286
2116954,2,B0002S648C,"Cheaply done with back ground pictures instead of real landscape.  Susan Hampshire is OK, she is the only reason we bought this series.",1380758400,,135,4.869565217391305
2116955,3,B0002S648C,"The series seemed to be a low grade filming? The story was good enough, the actors were marginal, but the film quality was distracting!",1380672000,,135,4.666666666666667
2116956,5,B0002S648C,"The Pallisers provides wonderful entertainment.  Susan Hampshire's lovely Lady Glencora and Philip Latham's steadfast Plantagenet Palliser have been justly praised, and the secondary leads are equally strong.  Barbara Murray as Marie Max Goesler, Donal McCann as Phineas Finn, Anna Massey and Derek Godfrey as Lady Laura and Robert Kennedy are superb, and so are the dozens of supporting players.

Writer Simon Raven has brilliantly dramatized Trollope's novels.  Characters are so well portrayed that they almost step from the pages into your living room. The series builds to a high point during courtroom scenes that are flawlessly acted and directed.

Buying the complete series was worth every penny.  If you enjoyed The Pallisers when the series first aired in 1974, you'll be delighted to see it again.  If you have never watched it, you have a treat in store.",1379635200,,867,5.239130434782608
2116957,4,B0002S648C,"I rate this 4 stars. Fascinating look at Victorian England politics and aristocracy privileges.
Upper class manipulations to maintain class power and privileges in a changing society.",1376006400,,183,5.814814814814815
2116958,5,B0002S648C,"The BBC green-lighted ""The Pallisers"" in 1974 as a follow-up to the 1967 version of ""The Forsyte Saga."" It never achieved the earlier show's success, which is a shame. ""The Pallisers"" is at least as good as ""The Forsyte Saga,"" and to my mind better.

Based on the six ""Palliser"" novels by Anthony Trollope, ""The Pallisers"" tells the story of Plantagenet and Glencora Palliser--wealthy, politically connected Victorian aristocrats--and their circle from the mid-1850s to the early 1880s. Vivacious Glencora (Susan Hampshire) and austere, dignified Plantagenet (Philip Latham) are forced into an arranged marriage, although they are both in love with other people. Over the years, despite much turmoil caused by their divergent personalities, they come to love and appreciate each other.

Although Glencora and Plantagenet's story is the basis for ""The Pallisers,"" other characters are front-and-center for most of the series. Some of the most fascinating include Phineas Finn (Donal McCann), an ambitious young Irish MP; Marie ""Madame Max"" Goesler (Barbara Murray), a Viennese widow who carries a torch for Phineas; and the madcap Lizzie Eustace (Sarah Badel), who fights her late husband's family for possession of the Eustace diamonds.

There is no question that ""The Pallisers"" is a much better-looking program than ""The Forsyte Saga."" Phil Meheux's color photography captures gloriously the production design of Raymond Cusick and the costumes of Raymond Hughes. (In an interview in the Special Features section of these DVDs, Susan Hampshire pays tribute to Hughes' painstaking efforts to make the colors and styles of the costumes as historically accurate as possible.)

Simon Raven's scripts are wonderfully literate, as well as informative about the political crises of Victorian England. The action never drags, as did the action of ""The Forsyte Saga"" in some of its final episodes. The cast of ""The Pallisers"" is completely equal to that of ""The Forsyte Saga,"" starting with Hampshire, who played Fleur Forsyte as well as Glencora. It is hard to imagine a more perfect job of casting than Philip Latham as Plantagenet, and nearly impossible to imagine him outside that role. Among the large, resplendent cast are superb veteran actors (Roger Livesey, Roland Culver, Fabia Drake), as well as actors who in 1974 qualified as Stars of Tomorrow (Derek Jacobi, Jeremy Irons, Anthony Andrews). For anyone who is interested in the Victorian era or in engrossing stories with literate dialogue, ""The Pallisers"" is a must-see.",1374192000,,2526,5.371212121212121
2116959,3,B0002S648C,We watched it all and enjoyed it to a certain extent but  there was way to much down time with absolutely nothing happening.,1372464000,,124,4.391304347826087

2116961,4,B0002S648C,I never read the series so this was a pleasant way to learn about the famous fictional characters Planty Pal and the intriguing Glencora.  It's an impressive production and the costumes stunning.  My only complaint is that I haven't been able to convince my children to watch it.,1369872000,,279,4.791666666666667

2116965,3,B0002S648C,"Pretty good series, atleast pretty clean.  Can get a little depressing in a few parts.  Gets a little goofy in some episodes.  My senior-age parents enjoyed enough to watch it again from time to time.",1365120000,,200,4.6571428571428575

2116968,2,B0002S648C,"As a big fan of Trollope, I'm always looking for films about his books.  This series, ""The Pallisers,"" is the only film version of Trollope's Palliser series.  I wish I could give it a good review, and right now I'm only into the 3rd DVD (parts 5 and 6), but I am truly disappointed and a bit angry.
  If you haven't read the books and enjoy Victorian literature in general or period pieces from the Victorian era you might enjoy this series.  I've also read some reviews from people who have read the books and enjoyed this film series; I am not one of those people.
  I also have to say right now that what follows may be considered a spoiler alert-my complaints about the film are directly related to characters and their portrayals.
  Glencora Palliser is barely 20 years old at the beginning of the books, and the actress portraying her is almost 40 years old.  It might have worked except for the fact that what works and is charming in a 20-year-old Glencora Palliser does not work in a 40-year-old woman trying to act like she's 20 years old.  To me, the effect has been to take one of my favorite characters in the series and make her look stupid.  Couldn't they find a younger actress to play the role?  Plus, the actress playing Glencora says in an interview that she had never read Trollope and had to read the Palliser books as she was filming the series.  She was hired at the last minute because Hayley Mills had to back out.  I wish they had just waited and found someone more suited to play the role of Glencora.  There are other deviations from the books as far as character portrayals are concerned, but none as glaring as this one.
  I actually can't wait until I get to the next DVD which will focus on Phineas Finn.",1358553600,2,1737,4.391849529780564
2116969,5,B0002S648C,All of the actors are wonderful.. Even if you do not think you like period drama's this was a wonderful series.  I personally Love Susan Hampshire and Jeremy Irions.  They are always worth watching.....,1358380800,,202,4.911764705882353

2116972,5,B0002S648C,One of the best family sagas I have watched on video.  The story is rich with drama.  Each character is portrayed so well they come alive on the screen. I have been a fan of Susan Hampsire for many years.  This period story is well worth rchasing and watching again and again.,1350777600,,276,4.269230769230769

is about British Parliment back in the day, the Victorian era.  The acting is superb as are the myriad of beautiful costumes the lead actress Susan Hampshire
wears.  She plays her part so well, is so lovely and her wardrobe for this period drama is the best I have ever seen. The interplay of relationships and
characters is fascinating and when I viewed this I thought....how very much like politics in the 21st Century.  When I finished the series, I scouted around
for pricing and the instant I received an Amazon e-mail with the best price I could ever hope for, I went for it.  Hope this litte review is helpful.",1350172800,,777,4.514285714285714
2116974,3,B0002S648C,"The start of the series is rather sedate and well, very English in nature. As you proceed it picks up tempo and starts to get interesting. This alas does not last long and as you reach the last few episodes turns into a rather clich sort story The morally strict father imposes this same rectitude on his sons and the eldest rebels. The young man knows he has the total love and support of his mother and therefore chooses to become a real S**t.
The other son of course toes the line and becomes his father's favorite ect.
I must admit I did not finish the seeing the last two disks maybe I'm being a bit too critical.

2116979,4,B0002S648C,"The Pallisers is the essence of soap opera. While at times slightly cheesy, on the whole it is classic British drama. British movie aficionados will recognise many of the actors and actresses throughout the series, especially the lovely Susan Hampshire who also stared in the series Monarch of the Glen (a more modern, but Scottish, soap opera).
The series vacillates back and forth between the drama of Victorian politics and the drama of the personal relationships of the families connected with it. While not as edgy as The Forsyth Saga, it will still draw you in and have you hoping your favorite character comes out on top. Both in the political and personal arena.",1348272000,,670,4.885964912280702

When I saw the set offered at such a reasonable price, I wondered if we'd enjoy it the same way now.  It turns out that in spite of the years - the shows are ""dated"" but then it has been over 30 years - we are enjoying a weekly episode once more.  The sets are not as ""real"" as sets are now, and some of the acting is stilted.  The costuming is not as ""authentic"" as we are used to now. But it's a good story.  Sometimes that's all it takes!  Good literature requires ""the willing suspension of disbelief"" - so does good viewing!",1348272000,,636,4.172131147540983

2116983,5,B0002S648C,"I'm a devoted ""Downton Abbey"" fan suffering through the hiatus and thought ""The Pallisers"" could help fill the gap. Oh, it did, it did - and then some. The well-written series is not only a good story about a fascinating family living in a fascinating period, it's also a good (painless) education in how the British parliament (and connected society) actually work. The production values are tops, even though it was made in 1974 - good, deep color, good sound (except when I trip up on those English accents and idioms), gorgeous costumes, fine acting. I enjoyed the series so much that I immediately watched it for a second time! The series comes with a companion pamphlet reader, and I recommend the viewer read the first 8 pages before watching the series. It's a good idea to read the Glossary of characters and terms after each episode, to reinforce your memory of each character (just read the ones you've seen to avoid spoilers). I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys and appreciates a good BBC series and likes the feeling of not only seeing a good show, but also learning something valuable at the same time. (Now I'm eager to re-read the Anthony Trollope books that are the basis for this series.) Note: I bought this series for about $42 during a special sale. I advise waiting for a similar sale.",1347753600,5,1324,4.686695278969957

The reason I did not buy it before was the price, over a hundred dollars. Well, now you can get this terrific story at a VERY reasonable price and own a wonderful classic. You will be taken back to the time of Queen Victoria and her grown son, Albert. The story does not revolve around them but around those in Parliment. Though it does have some political actions of the time, it deals more on the social side of society, the manners of the day and the things expected of one at the time. Our heroine is Glencora Pallister and you'll absolutely fall in love with her. The costumes alone are well worth the watch and are true to the era. Love, passion, anger, schemes, political manuvering, getting caught up in true friend's lives, it's all there.

2116985,4,B0002S648C,I enjoyed this series but it does start out a little slow. Just stay with it and come to know the characters and you will become  enthralled with the story line.,1346716800,,161,4.193548387096774
2116986,5,B0002S648C,"""The Pallisers"" was a 26-part, made-for-television miniseries (from 1974) that dramatizes the six Palliser novels by Anthony Trollope: (1) ""Can You Forgive Her?"" from 1865 (basis for parts 1 -6); (2) ""Phineas Finn"" from 1869 (basis for parts 6 -12); (3) ""The Eustace Diamonds"" from 1873 (basis for parts 11 -14);  (4) ""Phineas Redux"" from 1874 (basis for parts 14-19); (5) ""The Prime Minister"" from 1876 (basis for parts 20 -24); and (6) ""The Duke's Children"" from 1880 (basis for parts 22 - 26). If you enjoy period dramas, then you should love this. The production is more in the form of a stage play, so do not expect some 100 million dollar Hollywood extravaganza.

At roughly 22 hours in length, the miniseries does an impressive job of including the most important scenes and characters from the novels. (Thanks to my e-book reader) I read all six novels prior to watching the miniseries. ""The Pallisers"" closely follows the Trollope novels, although there were a few unnecessary (and inexcusable) deviations from the novels. Simon Raven, the writer of the series, admits that he took liberties with Trollope's work. According to Raven, ""I suppose that some Trollope purists may be shocked at what I have done. But I have added and subtracted from the original in order to translate the books into television terms."" Raven also admits to focusing the television serial on Glencora and Plantagenet Palliser. This may explain why one of the main plots from the first novel is missing from the miniseries.

The miniseries and the novels tell the stories of English aristocrats over a period of approximately 20 years during the reign of Queen Victoria. Anthony Trollope explained that he wanted to explore how characters and customs naturally change with time. In this, he was brilliantly successful. The stories focus on parliamentary politics, including many of the legal and political issues of those times.

The serial is very well cast. Obviously, lead actress Susan Hampshire (in the role of Lady Glencora Palliser) is the heart and soul of this miniseries. Of course, prior to this series, Susan Hampshire received Emmy Awards for The Forsyte Saga (1970), The First Churchills (1971), and Vanity Fair (1973). She is a wonderful actress and was perfect for this role. During one of the interviews on the DVD, Susan Hampshire explains that actress Haley Mills was originally cast for the role. When Haley Mills became unavailable, the producers had to find an actress who would fit into the costumes that had already been created for Haley Mills. Luckily for Ms. Hampshire (and for all of us who adore her), the clothes fit, and she got the part.

I only have one casting criticism. I feel that Donal McCann was not quite right for the important role of Phineas Finn. Mr. McCann did not have the right (good) looks, and his performance did not adequately portray the charm, intelligence, and personal integrity that influence other people to support, trust, and promote Phineas.

The costumes are very impressive. In an interview on the DVDs, Susan Hampshire explains the great care that the costume designer (Raymond Hughes) took designing entirely authentic clothing.

Well, unfortunately the Pallisers is not it.  The characters get little chance to become more than cardboard images of themselves, the circumstances within which the stories unfold are drawn out and boring, the acting is more wooden than the plots.

Imagine that.  Talent.  Not special effects.  My, oh, my, they sure can't make one like this today because it doesn't need gimicks to trick the audience.  Now, there aren't a lot of shots of country houses (but what there are are not bad) and it looked to me like most of the inside shots were in a studio, not on-site.  But it doesn't matter because it is so well done.  Oh, and I lost my heart to Madame Max...the sexiest woman alive!  Only one flaw...the characters from America had blatantly English accents.

2116991,5,B0002S648C,"I watch this series once a year (maybe twice if I'm feeling particularly in an Anglophilic mood) and am always left feeling privileged for being able to own such wonderful ""stories"".  Mr. Trollope told an amazing tale of wealth, snobbery, murder, foresaken love, intrigue, madness....he covered just about the whole range of emotions and subjects, and I truly admire the herculenean task the producers of ""The Pallisers"" undertook to condense the author's massive tomes into a handful of beautifully-filmed and wonderfully-acted videos.  I watched every minute of the PBS showing and bided my time until it was shown again.....then, I was practically first in line at the library to reserve the videos and was thrilled to pieces when my husband gifted me with the DVDs several years ago!

While there is certainly a lot of deep, dark moments and love/heart-break, there is a lot of humor in these stories, too, and some very unique characters, such as Dolly Longstaffe and the Duke of St. Bungay.  Not everything was bleakly Victorian (though I often wanted to shake staid Plantagenet out of his unbelievable stuffiness---he was as haughty as his uncle---and to pull that stick that he had lodged up his you-know-what; thank heavens, he changed later in the story!), and the lighter moments really pulled all the tales together.  Glencora Palliser was my all-time favorite character, of course, but my favorite couple had to be Phineas and Marie Finn~~the epitome of the solidly-married couple.  Marie was a much more solid and stable entity, loving, caring, and always there for Glencora and her family.  Lucky the person who has such a friend!

I would certainly recommend to anyone who loves a good, solid story (sans swashbuckling) to own these DVDs.  You won't regret it!!!",1291248000,11,1778,5.061643835616438

2116993,5,B0002S648C,"This series scores high marks in almost every category.  In fact, in most areas, its just off the charts.  First of all, the acting is wonderful and the cast is perfectly chosen.  And then there's the costumes - they must have won awards in this area.  Each costume looks so totally authentic.  It looks like they must have spent thousands of pounds or dollars on each outfit.  The sets are also magnificent with all sorts of detail and depth.  You seem to be able to look right back into them.  The writing and story are also peerless.  Even the dialogue itself sounds authentically Victorian in every way.  In addition to that the customs, mannerisms, and attitudes (not always nice) of the time are shown.  My wife and I bought this after watching the complete series (box set) of Upstairs, Downstairs.  They are two very different series although they do have some things in common in that they both go a long way in showing you the fashions and culture of the time in which they are set.  This show is, by the way, set about 50 or 60 years prior to Upstairs, Downstairs.  And unlike Upstairs, Downstairs the servants have no role whatsoever.  Nor do we get much of a look at the underclasses.  This show is all about the elite and their pursuit of power, sometimes for good and sometimes for bad.  Phillip Latham shines as Planty Palliser in the series.  We also get to see a young Jeremy Irons and Anthony Andrews who would meet up again in Brideshead Revisited a few years later.  There is also a young Derek Jacobi who has horrendous hair for some reason, but who is brilliant in his performance.

About the only slightly negative thing I can say about this series is that despite all the above praises, it is shot with lighting and camera work that does not seem to be commensurate with the quality it shows in all the other areas.  And occasionally some very artificial visual backdrops are used.  But believe me, you forget about these things very quickly as you become enthralled in the story.

I have no problem whatsoever giving this series 5 stars.  Its just brilliant, and quite addictive.",1283040000,4,2105,4.581769436997319

2116995,4,B0002S648C,"This is a great series but the liberties that they take with the characters are very irritating and keep me from giving it a 5 star rating.
The first story in the series is Can You Forgive Her? and it is about Alice, not Glencora. Glencora doesn't enter the novel till over 100 pages into it but the video series focuses on Glencora and Plantagenet from the opening.
My second large objection is the preposterous idea that Phineas Finn gets Mary pregnant and is forced to marry her. Trollope is clear that he only kisses her once (behind a door) and Finn finally goes back to her at the end of the second novel, Phineas Finn, because he keeps remembering 'his Mary', and he longs for her and all that she represents.
I do like how odiously Lizzie Eustace is portrayed in the section devoted to the third book. I had to assure my boys that she definitely gets hers in the end!",1269302400,9,875,4.374233128834356

I like the way that they are able to develop their relationship over such a long time and show how two very different people can grow in their love, respect, and understanding of one another, while giving us lots of period drama, costuming, and interesting historical background of the era.",1265587200,5,536,4.857142857142857
2116998,4,B0002S648C,"As w/The Duchess of Duke Street, this series is visually stunning and makes one forget that you're actually viewing a DVD and not there in person.  The costumes, furniture and landscape are so spectacular that it made me envious of those born in that time period except for the fact that women had virtually no rights back then.

It did take me until nearly halfway through the series before I began to actually like the story and the characters, though, because the acting is so over the top.  Dramatic doesn't even begin to describe it.  The lead character, Plantagenet Palliser, or ""Planty Pal"" as he was sometimes called, as played by Philip Latham was distracting for me at first because, forgive me for this, his voice sounds exactly like the voice of comedian Norm MacDonald!  I kept waiting to hear him say ""Is my face ever red!""  (one of MacDonald's classic lines in his standup)  Once I got past that, however, I was able to enjoy his character.  Susan Hampshire is another who grew on me.  In the beginning, I found her character, Lady Glencora, to be annoying because Hampshire has a habit of always touching her hands to her abdomen; why, I don't know but it, too, was distracting.  Finally, when I decided to overlook these things and just get into the story, I found myself totally immersed in it and was sad when the series ended.

The series primarily follows the lives of Plantagenet and Glencora but it is divided into several novels all of which stand on their own and add much to the series as a whole.  I'll admit to never having read Trollope until I stumbled upon the Pallisers but now that I've seen this marvelous work, I look forward to reading his novels and to viewing more productions of his work.

Highly recommended!",1253664000,9,1748,4.618122977346278

2117000,5,B0002S648C,"I love Victorian novels.  There's nothing like immersing oneself in a long-gone way of life and experiencing the subtleties of character and language that the likes of Dickens, Collins and Trollope did so well, and for 400 plus pages at a time.

The Pallisers is an excellent translation of Trollope's novels to the small screen. Because of the series format, none of the characters gets short shrift and all of the intricacies of the various plots are given their due.  Unforgettable characters such as Phineas Finn, Lady Eustace and the enchanting Lady Glencora play out their dramas against the rigid societal structure of the 19th century, and the BBC's production is flawless down to the wallpaper and china patterns.

I consider The Pallisers and Upstairs Downstairs to be the two must-haves of any collection, and neither EVER disappoints.  Both worlds are as wonderful to visit for the fiftieth time as they are for the first.",1245369600,9,934,5.0
2117001,5,B0002S648C,"Anthony Trollope's strength lies in his ambiguous characters. They are very true to life in that their personalities do not fall to absolutes.

*Plantagenet Palliser, later the Duke of Omnium, demands much of and commands much to those around him, but he is generous and sacrifices his ambitions for the welfare of his loved ones. He is an egalitarian liberal and yet sometimes a hypocrite when he looks down on those not born in his class.

*Glencora Palliser loves Plantagenet but not right away and she never forgets she was made to give up her first love.

*George Vavasor is an enterprising, ambitious, worthy man who cannot bear to humble himself and breaks under the strain to become a cad.

*Phinneas Finn aspires to women of a class above him while dallying with a girl of more humble origins, and yet quits a lucrative post on a matter of principle.

*Ferdinand Lopez swindles money from business associates, from the Duke of Omnium, from his father in law to finance his speculations and ambitions, but when these fail he shows remarkable courage, concern, and tenderness in doing the right thing.

The situations of these characters work themselves out following what I like to call Trollope's moral calculus.

*When the liberal duke refuses to allow his daughter to marry a commoner.

*When Glencora, who found deep and true happiness with Plantagenet, resolves because of her own lost love that her children will not suffer her fate.

*When Phinneas Finn gets a girl whom he doesn't love in trouble and marries her, despite having been a bit of a brute.

*When the wealthy Marie Max refuses the advances of the elder Duke of Omnium, from whom Plantagenet inherits the title later in the series, and also refuses to be his wife because both courses lead to a loss of honour.

It is usually Trollope who does the calculating, by the way, not his characters.

The Palliser series has taken some liberties with the novels but in this respect I don't mind. I never loved Trollope for his plots and the changes made aren't important because the plots aren't important.

More interesting is that where in this series the main characters are Plantagenet and Glencora, in the novels these two are often recurring secondary characters who grow in between the novels.

A wonderful BBC period piece.

2117002,5,B0002S648C,"I loved The Pallisers because it seemed so real.  The acting was never wooden or off beat.  Everyone seemed to be what their character suggested.  The writing was first rate.  The funny thing is that it was Lady Glencora who stole my heart.  I liked all the characters in The Pallisers but, for some weird reason Lady Glencora seemed so real she almost popped off the screen.  As I watched The Pallisers it was almost as if Lady Glencora became real her character was that deep and rich.  Everyone in the The Pallisers seemed real.  There was not a lame actor in the bunch.

I must warn you that Jewish people are really badly portrayed in this story.  I mean the author seems almost to go out of his way to dredge up the most ugly vicious stereotypes of jewish people I will not repeat here.  I do not know if virolent antisemitism as shown in The Pallisers was the scurge of the times or if the author was just plain hateful.  I mean the way Jews are protrayed in The Pallisers would almost be worthy of a Nazi film.

That said The Pallisers is an endearing story over all the racist bits not withstanding.  It is about politics but is also about the wife of a powerful man in Victorian times.  I loved The Pallisers, I adored Lady Glencora and about the portrayal of Jews in the The Pallisers, I AM NOT AMUSED!  I would not let the Jewish hate in The Pallisers stop me from buying it because, to look into the face of past evils allows us to revel in its demise and fight against its resurgence!",1232236800,6,1498,4.296428571428572

I cut my teeth on Austen, Dickens, Thackeray, George Eliot, etc., but never seemed to have gotten around to Trollope, either because of lack of time or that I subconsciously thought him not as worthwhile to read as the other luminaries from what I've gleaned of  critics.

Recently, I checked out this BBC series from the library to get an idea whether his storytelling and treatment of themes and characters would be to my taste, and -- with the proviso, of course, that TV or film adaptations can never do complete justice to works of literature -- have found that they do and will look forward to reading him.

The series is very long (look to invest in at least several weekends and it helps if one has experienced previous long BBC sagas like The Forsytes) and is a bit slow-moving and soap-operatish in the first several episodes, but becomes fairly involving, intelligent, and rewarding as it moves along. It's uniformly well-acted (especially by the actors who played Phineas Finn and Mrs. Goesler) and has sumptuous sets and costumes (the opening scene at the Duke's garden party is a stunner).
