8571407,5,B00BNADZP8,"I was a little wary with the second season of this absolutely hilarious Mexican tv series. Could they top the first season, or would they already run out of ideas? To recap the previous season: a group of motley characters, all with musical ambitions but different backgrounds, form a grupero band and after many (hilarious) situations, become the number one sensation in Mexico and hit the big time. But with fame and fortune also come... taxes, which even with all the money they've made, they would never be able to pay back in a million years, so they do the best they can in a situation like that; they've got to disappear with a bang!

The second season opens when we learn that our favorite grupero band has crashed in their private plane, and only one member of the band survived: Zaca, the lead vocalist. All of Mexico mourns our dead heroes, and what ensues is the biggest funeral ever attended in Mexico since Pedro Infante's death (actually most of the footage shown is from Infante's real funeral). But are the rest of the members of the band really dead, or have they chosen to go into hiding to avoid paying taxes? If so, how long can they remain hidden before someone recognizes them, and the whole world finds out they aren't really dead? Such is the premise of this second season, which is even funnier and crazier than the first one. High points include Zaca's over-inflated ego-maniac personality that reaches absurd proportions, not to mention how ridiculously bloated he physically gets; Apolinar finding a commie-like hippie girl named Natasha who falls head over heels for him, driving Apolinar's ""real"" wife Margara into a frenzy of jealousy until they discover a sort of m&egrave;nage-&agrave;-trois love situation, which leads Apolinar to discover the advantages of being a Muslim; El Faquir's hilarious haircut; and the funniest body-snatching event ever seen on the screen!

What sets this series apart from anything else on TV, is not only how funny and how well do the five main characters interact with one another, but how good is the rest of the cast. Even the women are fearless playing some of the most hysterically funny buffoons I've ever seen; Margara's absolutely horrendous mispronunciations of the language is just so hilarious, you'd believe she's actually a crazy foreigner; the mennonite Prisca's naivety towards sex and her blaming everything on the catholics is a hoot (actually her character is so good that it deserves a spin-off series, as she becomes a tv soap star, sexy model, and singer. The actress who plays her, Karla Souza, is so good, not to mention absolutely beautiful and talented, that we demand to see more of her. Karla by the way, has recently starred in the biggest movie box-office hit in Mexico, ""Nosotros los Nobles"" where she plays another hilarious character, making her one of Mexico's most wanted actors); Natasha the would-be commie/hippie girl is also extremely good, so much that she has become an essential character; and even a non-actress as tv sports personality Martina Franz is amazingly great (not to mention stunningly beautiful as well).

All in all, this series has reached a level on par with the best comedies coming from the US (even topping some of them). Let's hope there'll be a third season, as the ending leaves you wanting for more. A real winner all the way! However, it'd be better appreciated if you actually understand or speak the language, or know something about Mexican culture. Though there are English subtitles, it's impossible to faithfully translate Botarga and Faquir's ""chilango"" slang, not to mention Margara's mispronunciation of the Spanish language (one of her most hilarious line being the one where she tells her husband to grow some ""ovaries"" and stop being a coward).

Highly recommended!",1371427200,5,3807,4.962382445141066

just as funny as the first ""season"".  one wonders if telerisible realises that they've put on the air a series that makes fun of the bad writing and clichs telerisible is so totally guilty of these days, while they're making horrible rehashes of beautiful 'novelas.  this is the first truly funny and good and well acted thing telerisible has put out in probably 10 years.

even when they take a comedic 'novela and rehash it, it's not funny!  how can their writers be so consistently lame???????????  it just boggles the mind.

anyway, i am just so anxious to get my hands on the DVDs.  i think the series might be almost over on the tele by the time i get them, but that's ok.  i can watch this stuff over and over and over again.",1369094400,,771,4.335664335664336
