8183717,1,B000O7863M,Like watching Jerry Springer! I was curious when I saw this online. It was a waist of money. It would be cheaper to watch Jerry Springer and maybe even more interesting.,1398384000,,169,4.483870967741935
8183718,1,B000O7863M,"This video had the potential of being a great piece if only it weren't for its incompetent producers. The title is misleading. The fighters are pure amateurs; they exhibit no boxing skills. Video and audio is low quality. The DJ tries to keep up, but he is always out of sync. The ref is good though. But that's not my main contempt considering this cheaply produced film is about emerging fighters. It's the immature interviewers who kill the whole thing; asking stupid questions, making fun of the fighters and taking away the seriousness of the matter.
Overall, this seems like a you-tube film and definitely not worth $9.",1293321600,,625,4.796296296296297
8183719,2,B000O7863M,"This film is totally unprofessional in respect to the quality of the female boxers. If biting the breast is a new rule in boxing then the 12 knockdown rule is too. Having boxed and being a 1st Dan in TKD since 1986 I have seen a plethora of fights as well as a having been a competitor. Any of these women if trained properly could become pro's but that is not the case here. I though that Ultimate Fighting is the worst title for this DVD. How about ultimate embarrassment. If you want to see good female boxing then Lucia Rijker in ""Shadow Boxers is a great pick. Craig Barr.",1266969600,,577,4.254545454545455
