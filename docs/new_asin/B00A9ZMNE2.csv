5401969,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"Each of these movies is awesome to behold.  It is true I did not always like the character being portrayed (Harriet Craig), but the performances were truly Joan Crawford moments.  She was a fine actress.  I am glad she can still 'live' via her excellent movie performances.",1359417600,8,273,4.76595744680851
5401970,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"Just received my Box Set of Joan it was great as far as the artwork and movies go, but the plastic sleeve that holds the discs was very poorly made, and hard to get the disc out and in without fear of scratching.",1358726400,2,212,3.953488372093023
5401971,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"At last a high quality pint copy on DVD of what i think is Crawford's best role Hariet Craig (even better than Mildred Pierce). I first heard of this film from an interview with director and Craford lover Vincent Sherman. Sherman stated that out of all the characters she played onscreen that this was the most like the real Joan. If you loved faye Dunaway in Mommie Dearest you will absolutely go bonkers for Harriet Craig. I obtained a bootleg DVD vesion several years agao. this movie os so good and Crawford is so perfect that i have watched it over 30 times. The nuanaces that Joan gives in he performances 9her glares and snears and line delivery is perfection. My two favorite scenes is when she fires her maid ellen Corby (Gramdman Walton) for breaking a cup and whne sh3 goes to her husband's boss trying to sabaotage a 3 month, long distance business trip her husband is to make. Of course Joan wants to keep the leash on him and doesnt want him out of her site and tries to ""innocently"" put the cabash on trip. Its absilutely priceless.

Queen Bee is another great Crawford role (kind of the step sister of Harriet Craig). Not quite as good but still a compelling role for Joan: that of a controlling and manipulative bitch. She seemed a natual for these roles. I wonde why?

Autumn Leaves is ok and Esther Costello is a two star film. Just happy that they have at least made it to DVD (Queen bee was released several years ago on its own).

Now if Warner would only release Letty Lynton,. Surely the statue of limitations must have run out on the infamous court battloe regarding that film.",1354147200,12,1602,4.47945205479452
5401972,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"In this beautiful box set released by Turner Classics three classic Joan Crawford films make their debut on DVD for the very first time: ""Harriet Craig"" (my favorite Crawford movie), ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""The Story of Esther Costello"". The fourth film here, ""Queen Bee"" saw a DVD release nearly a decade ago, but it's nice to have it here in this collection.

 This 4 disc set (each film has its very own DVD disc) documents the Joan Crawford of the 1950's when she did her best work for various studios, in this case Columbia. In these movies you see a tough-as-nails Crawford (""Harriet Craig"", ""Queen Be""), a woman who is beaten by a crazed younger lover (""Autumn Leaves"" which was one of Joan's personal favorite pictures) and a woman who is desperately trying to protect her newly adopted daughter in ""The Story of Esther Costello"".

 There isn't much here in ways of bonuses, but there is a nice introduction at the beginning of ""Harriet Craig"", the movies look flawless having been remastered, they are all in FULL SCREEN format and I am sure all Joan Crawford fans will rejoice in the fact that three of these movies finally have a home on DVD for posterity and for us to enjoy.

 My only complaint here is that the plastic that holds the DVD's in is inferior and breakable so be very careful in taking out the discs. The packaging, however, is wonderful with release dates of the films, some neat pictures of Joan from these movies and a full size pic of Joan from ""Queen Bee"" blazing on the inside cover with Joan sitting on a bed holding one of her shoes up.",1353715200,21,1567,4.539007092198582

Am returning to seller, but now she has to pay RETURN postage on a defective item!!!!  Come on AMAZON, any seller should cover return postage on THEIR OWN MISTAKES!!!!!

This set is my absolute favorite collection of Joan Crawford movies. I have actually owned it for several years, but purchased again for my sister. All movies are some of her very best movies. Queen Bee is the exception, more of a cult classic, with Joan as Queen evil bitch, but fantastic at it. Harriett Craig is my all time favorite as she gets hers in the end. Autumn Leaves is a beautiful love story of two lost people lucky enough to find each other and build a life together.  For those who truly adore Joan Crawford movies, you must own this set. Excellent!!!!",1472515200,,860,4.452229299363057
5401976,5,B00A9ZMNE2,Great collection of her 1950s output. The only weak one is The Story of Esther Costello. Harriet Craig is perfection. Queen Bee is campy fun. Autumn Leaves is subtle and touching. This set proves Joan did go on to make some good films after the 1940s.,1466985600,,251,4.478260869565218

5401980,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"I am hard of hearing. Do these Crawford DVDs have English subtitles? I would love to order the set but I need the subtitles. I really think that she reached her apotheosis as an actress from Mildred Pierce onward. So sorry she was a lousy mother but as an actress, her presence simply sizzles.",1452902400,,293,4.444444444444445
5401981,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"What a treat to get all these Joan Crawford films in one package and for such a reasonable price!  Honestly, I bought it just to get one of my all-time favorite films, ""Autumn Leaves"", which previously only could be purchased on a videotape.  I love this film.  Cliff Robertson is so damn hot looking in this film and he and Joan playing a younger man/older woman having a romance is worth watching.  Lorne Greene and Vera Miles are exceptional just as Cliff and Joan are.  Joan Crawford was quite a woman and I love her acting.  She was a true movie star in every sense of the word.  The other films are exceptional as well, but ""Autumn Leaves"" is just special to me.  ""The Story of Esther Costello"" is a very touching, good film as well as are the others in this set.  Oh, yes.  ""Queen Bee""--  what a film!  Joan is exceptional in this one as well.  She's a beautiful, evil, cold blooded, selfish, vain woman who takes everything and everyone for granted.  Yet as it should be, she pays in the end for the pain and anguish she causes to those around her.",1440547200,6,1056,4.348717948717948

5401986,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"I logged on to leave a review of Autumn Leaves, which I've seen several times over the years and is apparently only available as part of this collection (and reading other reviews I'll have to see the other offerings too).  The inimitable Joan Crawford is as splendid as always in it- it's over-the-top and CAMPY as can be, and wonderful, worthy of cult classic status.  A big slice of 50's life in L.A., for starters, from the ""apartment court"" to the fashions (e.g., Joan sports full skirts with crinkly crinoline slips and high heels).  This was WAY off the beaten path when it came out.  ***SPOILER ALERT***

You get to see Joan, her younger lover Cliff Robertson (they were ages 52 and 33, though Robertson looks and acts much younger), a virile, hunky Lorne Greene, and Vera Miles in bathing suits, another perk.  Joan's best friend is a frowsy, eccentric landlady who cracks wise.  As she did so often, Joan plays a long-suffering woman to fevered perfection, and no-one fills the screen like she, riveting as always.  Cliff Robertson is very green here, acting-wise, overacts in bursts throughout.  The story has surprising twists, and without giving away the ending I'll just say that the scenes in the mental hospital are priceless- the psychiatrist renders diagnoses including schizophrenia, psychosis, AND neurosis, among other things (all in one hapless patient!), and the poor soul is restrained, receives drugs, electroshock therapy, and what appear to be sodium pentothal injections(!), all to treat an imbalance that resulted from a traumatic event!

Despite the fact that there was obviously no psychiatric technical advisor on the film (and no-one as much as cracked open a Psychology 101 text), and that it was made on a shoestring, it has a satisfying ending and manages to blend the heights of unintended camp with a well-paced and intriguing story.  And the title song, with Johnny Mercer lyrics and sung by Nat King Cole, is woven throughout and lovely- icing on the cake.  Highly recommended.",1410393600,3,2017,4.988059701492538
5401987,5,B00A9ZMNE2,The movie was excellent. I loved the movie and the service in getting the movie was superb.,1404259200,,91,4.411764705882353
5401988,5,B00A9ZMNE2,Each of these films included in this set is worth the price of all four.  GREAT value for a great actress and films.,1393718400,,116,4.043478260869565
5401989,5,B00A9ZMNE2,I have been waiting for decades for some of these films to come out on DVD or even be released.  Clear picture and sound. Very enjoyable for a Joan Crawford fan.,1389830400,,161,4.193548387096774
5401990,4,B00A9ZMNE2,"I am one of Joan Crawford's biggest fans.  Having said that, the 1950's began ""Joan - the scenery chewing years"".  She was over the top by the time the 50's rolled around, but hey, she was an aging superstar clinging to her career with every bone in her body, so I give her credit for pouring herself into these second tier melodramas.  She was always a force of nature.  Joan is paired with ""B"" actors by this time period, and consequently overwhelms the films at times, but that really isn't her fault.  Bette Davis was having the same problem in this era.  Leading actresses who had the gall to age simply didn't have viable options in those days.  Older actresses were relegated to character roles.  Period.  If Hollywood had possessed a progressive mind set in those days, she would have been paired with actors of her caliber, not to mention better scripts, and her method would have been tempered by the abilities of her co-stars.  Here she seems oddly out of place.  These lesser actors have a tough time holding their own in the presence of such a legend, but they give it the old college try.  I watch these movies because Joan Crawford is fascinating.  I don't think any actress was as devoted to being a ""star"".  Her drive and passion is what elevates these otherwise ""less than stellar"" movies to a higher level.  These movies are what they are.  Accept that and enjoy!",1389225600,5,1382,4.579591836734694
5401991,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"I thought this was a great collection of Crawford movies as it shows the last period in her career where she had serious top billing roles. Many on here have commented about the films themselves which are quite good, but I wanted to mention price, I purchased this collection several months ago directly from the TCM shop, where it is significantly cheaper than amazon under $35. What gives?? Amazon usually has the best prices but nearly double a movie set that is not out of print?? I loved the set but would advise going to TCM directly!",1382140800,,540,4.577319587628866
5401992,5,B00A9ZMNE2,I've been waiting years for these to come out and now I have them in one set. The transfer quality is superb. A fine set for true JC fans. Highly recommended,1377820800,2,157,4.096774193548387
5401993,4,B00A9ZMNE2,"In Queen Bee, Crawford plays a maniacal, scheming Southern Belle driving everyone around her to live miserable lives. She even manages to drive Betsy Palmer to suicide. Crawford pulls out all the stops and tears the scenery to shreds in the process.
Harriet Craig presents Crawford as the Queen of OCPD.  She lives only for Her home and its beautiful contents to the detriment of every personal relationship in Her life. The final curtain finds her climbing the steps of her home after losing all friends and family. This is off the charts Camp.
Autumn Leaves finds a middle-aged Crawford in love with a much younger Cliff Robertson.  They must overcome his violent mental illness that stems from a familial sexual tryst that Robertson witnesses. Heavy stuff for the 50's and actually quite well acted.
The Story of Esther Costello involves Crawford in a charitable scam operation. She sets out with honorable intentions, but a renewed relationship with her husband turns her around.  Good acting by Crawford and Heather Sears as the blind deaf mute who is the basis for the bogus charity.
This 50's Crawford set is worth your time and money!",1374278400,12,1142,4.9067357512953365
5401994,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"I love Joan Crawford films from her role in Mildred Pierce onward into the late 40s, 50s and even 60s horror films because she had assumed her signature 'look' by this time and often played strong characters and even characters that were too young for her. But it's Joan so who cares. She is always a lot of fun to watch! I wish Female on the Beach had been included in this set too. As far as the packaging, it is tricky but there is a way to get the discs out safely. The way it's made, you have to push the disc downward and then pull up. Also, Amazon does not have this in stock so it's only available from private sellers at a very high price. If you go to the Turner Classic Movies shop online, you will find it for $34.99. I agree with others that Harriet Craig is the best film of the bunch, but Autumn Leaves and Queen Bee are definitely worth watching too. Enjoy!",1370044800,11,873,4.141176470588236
5401995,2,B00A9ZMNE2,None of the movies are really GREAT!  Great to watch J.C. but  but NOT with that  price tag...Not for me thanks.,1369008000,3,112,4.238095238095238
5401996,5,B00A9ZMNE2,A wonderful DVD collection that showcases Joan Crawford's impeccable talent; my personal favorite is Autumn Leaves.  Worthwhile purchase for any classic film fan's library!,1365033600,2,172,6.166666666666667
5401997,4,B00A9ZMNE2,"THe films are great.  THe transfers pristine.  Good luck getting them out of the packaging without breaking them.  I don't understand why TCM packaged so poorly.  The DVDs are packaged so tightly, one above the other...it took me half an hour to pry ""Harriet Craig"" out of the case.....this is ridiculous.  WHen I looked at the back I noticed that in attempting to pry loose the DVD from it's tight package, the DVD was scratched a little.  Thankfully, it played just find, but I did not put it back in this inferior case.  When I get the rest of the films out, I'm going to put them in plastic sleeves.  Enjoy the films.  But CAUTION:  Please be careful when you take the DVDs out of their case.",1364515200,20,696,4.409448818897638
5401998,4,B00A9ZMNE2,"Joan at her bitchy best.  Although she was getting long at the tooth by this time, all her
performances are fine and so are supporting casts.  Excellent prints on all four films.
Queen bee is the only title that was released previously on DVD.  The other three are

5402000,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"Joan Crawfords work is phenomenal .I had these movies on VHS. Harriet Craig  a purlitzer prize winner play by far is amaseing because the voters of that prize picked up on something in human nature that I have had the unfortunate run in with my personal life. It prepared me for task of taking care of my father whom carried out scenes from the movie by behavior ! In his demented elderly state. Autumn leaves , living that too ""don't ask""! Yes worth the money .I would recommend "" I never sang for my father""Gene Hackman, and The Savages All 3 movies dealt with elderly issues and care,That because father didn't raise me chose to deal with.",1362355200,,642,4.487179487179487
5402001,5,B00A9ZMNE2,"I'm a big Joan Crawford fan and, for the past few years, have been attempting to collect all of her available films on DVD for my collection. I was jazzed when I heard TCM was going to release four more Crawford films from the 1950s. Three of the films on this set - Autumn Leaves, Harriet Craig and The Story of Esther Costello - have been difficult to find and have never been released on DVD. In fact, I've only seen Autumn Leaves on TCM once in my life (though I'm sure it's been aired more than once) and had never seen Harriet Craig and Esther Costello aired on television.

First, the films themselves. All four are solid releases. Not Oscar worthy and a bit on the campy side, but still well done and highly entertaining. In the 1950s, Crawford had yet to delve into the ""independent"" genre and was still getting work at big name studios. I wouldn't go so far to say these are A pictures but you wouldn't know that by Crawford's performances. No matter what film she was in, she always acted like she was starring in the biggest budget film of all time. Crawford never phoned it in. In my opinion, the weakest of the four films is Autumn Leaves mainly because it's a product of its own time. It's a good film but it will likely cause a few eye rolls because Crawford's character is a little too understanding and patient. It's still worth a look and definitely an interesting film that was ahead of its time. The standouts for me are Harriet Craig and Queen Bee mainly because Crawford is hell on wheels in both of these films and at her campy best. No one on the planet could play such a nasty character while looking oh-so-fabulous in over the top clothing (by Jean Louis, thank you very much) and oodles of jewels! As for extras, there are few. No commentaries or anything of that nature, but there are slide shows on each disc with lobby cards, movie posters and behind-the scenes photos.

The only real downsides to this release is the price and the packaging. The price is a little on the high side but considering these films are not available anywhere else and they do look good (I won't get into aspect ratios, etc. because I have no idea what any of that means!) I can deal with it. I did shop around because frankly, I'm not too keen on paying $6 shipping for ONE single set which is what TCM charges. The packaging is also a pain. When I initially got this set, it took me 20 minutes to pry one disc out of the plastic holder. I don't know if the set I got has a manufacturing defect but getting the discs in and out is difficult. I'll probably end up putting the discs in paper sleeves because I nearly broke the disc with Harriet Craig on it trying to get it out.

Despite the slightly inflated price and shoddy plastic case, I'm pleased as punch that I bought this set. It's a must for Crawford fans and I'm glad TCM got the bright idea to release more of Crawford's hard to find films.",1362096000,11,2909,4.33394495412844
5402002,4,B00A9ZMNE2,"Any fan of Joan Crawford will not be disappointed with this set.  Although I was doubtful about purchasing these, after reading the reviews, I decided to try it.
I was pleasantly surprised. ""Harriet Craig"" and ""Queen Bee"" will satisfy anyone
hungry for good Crawford movies. ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Esther Costello"" also good. Would not consider all of these ""blockbusters"", but, I completely enjoyed these and would recommend to anyone who needs a shot of Crawford. Although a bit older, Joan can still pack a punch!
