8587822,4,B00CZBDD3S,"I was freighted of buying this by some of the negative reviews, but seceded to give it a try after reading an appreciation of Zimmermann in the New York Times.  After one viewing, I'd count this a worthy opera, easily finding a place with the best of Berg and Schoenberg; although it will take quite a few more viewings (or listens before I'll have a real appreciation of what's going on in the orchestra - that is if such is even possible without a score.",1524614400,,456,4.364705882352941
8587823,1,B00CZBDD3S,"Well this opera presentation goes there and beyond.
Get the music alone, if you're to enjoy this at all.
Good luck.",1398038400,,115,4.523809523809524
8587824,5,B00CZBDD3S,"Incredible Salzburg Festival production that utilizes the vast stage of the Felsenreitschule. Virtually x-rated performances, though no nudity. Not for the faint of heart or ear. Twelve-tone to the max, with strict neoclassical structures modeled on Berg's ""Wozzeck."" It's an essential late 20th-century masterpiece, and allegedly anti-war -- although it seems anti-human being to me. No doubt the innovative stage director, Alvis Hermanis, takes enormous liberties with the material. The singers (of whom I have never heard before) are superb.",1386979200,3,544,5.8125
