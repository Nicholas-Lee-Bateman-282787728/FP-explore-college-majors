5448276,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Disregard the bad reviews, this is an excellent lecture series. The historical narrative has a nice flow that takes you from ancient Mesopotamia to Charlemagne. Dr. Aldrete is enthusiastic and entertaining and the map presentations and cultural artifacts help to further clarify the lecture. If you need a bunch of over the top CGI to captivate your interest this is not the series for you, but if you're genuinely interested in history or want a more comprehensive understanding of the ancient world this series is the way to go. Additionally, a handful of the videos are free, so preview a lecture or two first.",1425600000,7,613,4.903846153846154

5448279,5,B008QQ6FKY,"What a fascinating, comprehensive, and analytic yet entertaining course on ancient history! Professor Aldrete is engaging, well-informed, and a great story-teller. He compares and contrasts the great ancient Empires but includes refreshing details that entrance the listener. I have explored all types of history but he managed to teach me an enormous amount and the final lecture was a real eye-opener and will change my entire concept of ancient history as it relates to the modern world. I hope the The Great Courses will produce further courses by this incredible professor.",1418860800,9,578,5.362637362637362

5448281,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Gregory Aldrete's lectures are great. He gets to the core of subjects, consistently talks about historical bias and how we know what we know, provides a realistic interpretation of everyday life in the ancient world, follows common themes that enable us to compare different ancient civilizations through a single narrative, and provides a wry, informative delivery style that makes learning about this subject actually fun. I highly recommend this course.",1386806400,2,456,5.5285714285714285
5448282,4,B008QQ6FKY,"This is a survey of the history of ancient civilizations given in lecture format like all the Great Courses.  I watched this course on the Great Courses Amazon channel. I have taken several courses that cover history of Europe and the Middle East in undergraduate courses in college. This particular course looks at ancient civilizations in The Middle East, Asia, Europe, Polynesia, and the Americas. Dr. Gregory Aldrete is highly qualified to teach this course and is very clear about what can and cannot be said with certainty. He covers the governments, literature, military, art, architecture, religion, and the effect of the land that each people inhabited on the various aspects of that civilization. He also compares and contrasts civilizations with one another.  Because it covers so much territory, the course is limited in how deeply it can delve into the details of each group.  However, the goal of the course is to gain ""a global perspective"" on the history of the ancient world, not to cover every detail.  Dr. Aldrete does an excellent job of comparing and contrasting civilizations. He discusses the possible  reasons they may have developed as they did. Dr. Aldrete has a knowledge and an enthusiasm for his subject that makes him easy to listen to. I would definitely watch another of his courses.",1489881600,,1315,5.013761467889908
5448283,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Amazing lectures! Excellent survey of different civilizations across the globe. Dr. Aldrete offers a systematic study and informative lectures. He is also quite funny. I especially like the comparison between cultures. Great courses are more like college level lectures. If you are expecting 30 minutes documentary for entertainment, then these lectures are not for you. Not all lectures from Great courses are 'Great'. Some of them are quite boring, but this one is definitely a five-star lecture. Thank you, Dr. Aldrete.",1489363200,,522,5.45679012345679

I subscribed to this channel in order to watch this and now I'm watching the decisive battles series taught by the same professor and it's a good followup.  This series covers central america, eqypt, iraq, iran, india, greece, italy, china for the most part.

5448302,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Professor Aldrete has a great personality, really enjoys presenting his subject, and has a very strong comedic skill.  Within the first 15 minutes he already had me in stitches, talking about how ridiculous he finds it when people tell him about their ""past lives"" when they were some ancient king, some gladiator, and so on, because, as he points out, the overwhelming majority of the human population actually didn't live in the cities where those things took place, but spent their lives toiling in the fields and never venturing far from home or doing much of anything interesting.  So when people tell him about all their exciting past lives in the ancient world, his response to them is that they would've instead been much more statistically likely to have been ""a farmer, a farmer, a farmer, and a farmer"".",1456444800,2,814,4.848920863309353
5448303,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Very clear and concise. A good global overview, it seems a little superficial some times, but understandably so, as the topics covered are broad.
This professor makes it entertaining and the visual aids are also helpful. I would take it as an introduction (slightly beyond high school level) to ancient history. From there, you may find some specific culture more interesting (say greece or mesopotamia) and next, when you are done with this, you can get into that specific culture on another course by the teaching company (mostly by others professors yes, but some that can investigate a particular topic in more detail).",1455667200,,623,5.058252427184466

5448316,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Aldrete is a lot of fun to watch and has a fun, snotty wit when he wants to.  My main complaint is that I wish he would've clarified that the reason for the terms ""Upper"" and ""Lower"" Egypt is that Upper is more in the upstream (higher elevation) direction of the Nile, and Lower is the downstrem (lower elevation) of the Nile.  Also, the reason for the term ""cataract"" in the Nile is that these are the regions of white and cloudy water -- like white and cloudy cataracts in the otherwise clear lens of the human eye -- due to turbulence caused by shallow, rocky sections and even waterfalls along the Nile's length.",1432944000,,616,4.394736842105263

5448318,5,B008QQ6FKY,"Professor Gregory Aldrete is a pleasure to listen to and watch. Mind you, this isn't cheesy History Channel-style ""reenactments."" What you get with The Great Courses is a broad survey of the ancient and pre-modern civilizations led by a scholar who is both extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the stories he is conveying. Professor Aldrete is highly organized and delivers exactly what the title promises: a global perspective -- not just on ancient ""western"" civilizations, but on early Asian and American civilizations all the way up through the middle ages.",1429833600,5,571,5.355555555555555
5448319,4,B008QQ6FKY,"I am a history buff and have been enjoying this series.  It presents some interesting information - conventional, but interesting.  My son is watching them as part of his schooling.

Update - Having watched the complete series I must say that I am fairly impressed.  The later episodes really bring it all together, firmly tie the past to our modern world and left me wanting more.  Since my main use of this is to supplement of my son's high school education this is of great benefit.  I hope to encourage him to continue learning long after finishing school and I think this will help.  As a side note, I should say that I bought individual episodes because I wasn't sure if this series would suit my purposes.  This worked to spread the cost out, while making sure this would be suitable for my son.  I'd encourage you to explore a couple of episodes and judge for yourself.  I found them entertaining, informative and worth my time and money.  Watching these was time well spent.",1428883200,6,983,4.591954022988506
5448320,5,B008QQ6FKY,"The lectures presented in this series are informative, insightful and entertaining. I would highly recommend to anyone seeking a step up from History Channel fare. Intellectually, the series certainly rates five stars. Its video, however, is nonexistent. Anyone seeking mere entertainment, as opposed to stimulating scholarly discourse, will therefore probably be disappointed. Coming from a generation that grew up sitting in front of a radio, I am fascinated by the cleverness and depth of knowledge presented by Dr. Aldrete.",1427328000,5,527,5.6835443037974684
5448321,5,B008QQ6FKY,"I agree with ""disregard the bad reviews.""  Buyer beware, etc.  This is part of the Great Courses that are intended to be college-level experiences.  I have ""taken"" at least six of the Great Courses and they are all in lecture format.  If you are looking for video re-enactments of the Iliad, then these are not for you.

History of the Ancient World: A Global Perspective is an excellent series.  Prof. Aldrete is a most engaging and personable lecturer.  I loved his use of contemporary (for the time) literature to add to the full experience of the course.  This course works well with any of the Ancient Greek Tragedy, Classic Mythology, and Ancient Technology courses also offered.  Ancient World does lean heavily on military history but I found this very interesting.  Aldrete is able to tell these stories without sending the listener into the deep state of somnolence usually brought on by high school history classes.

I was pleased to see parts of the world beyond the traditional ""cradle of civilization"" included in the course.  As a college graduate of many years ago, I found this course to be splendidly suited to my level of interest and intellectual curiosity.  It was far more effective in bringing alive the times and cultural significance of these areas than dry course I took at college.

I look forward to future courses from Prof. Aldrete.",1425600000,16,1362,4.8652173913043475
8553239,5,B008QQ6FKY,"I love ancient mesopotamian, greek, and roman history and culture. I can't speak highly enough about this series and Mr. Aldrete's presentation. I learned plenty of new information.  His coverage of other civilizations, such as the Han and Persian Empires, filled in gaps in my knowledge. By comparing and contrasting them with civilizations I'm more familiar with, my interest in them has been picqued. This is learning at its best.",1527465600,,433,5.185714285714286

8553242,3,B008QQ6FKY,Good Macro-Scale General Facts Review. Pros: Interesting vocal variety by presenter. Large scale historical coverage. Cons: Extremely weak graphic support (with periodic map presentations the exception). Course writing and scripting at times vague and at times without seeming support. I often used this course for background noise when doing something else and in that manner managed to pick up many interesting facts. Would not recommend for academic school use without point by point instructional guidance!,1508889600,,510,5.8133333333333335

Aldrete reflect on personal historical personalities and challenges, as well as cultural and philosophical/religions perspectives--bring history to life.  Terrific contracts and commonality descriptions of world areas such as Mediterranean, Asia, North America.  Although there are a number of Episodes, they move at a very good pace, and cover important regional events--never slow or boring for me.  Although details may be taught at University/College levels, select Episodes should be shown to all High School students to provide a broad perspective on World history and civilization developments that impact and define our current Civilizations.

Sure, the professor needs proper shoes and much better fitting pants (come on Wisconsin!), but he has done a service in laying out for the interested audience the amazing scope of pre-medieval  (I personally hesitate to call it ancient because ancient is what is further back)  history.

As a whole, I very much enjoyed the course and recommend it to those seeking to refresh their memories or gain an overview of ancient civilizations. Dr. Aldrete clearly loves what he does and hes able to convey somewhat complex issues through stories or other ways that allows the viewer to easily capture the points. His lectures are nonbiased in nature, rarely giving his own option, and hes very clear when putting forth information for which either archeological or written evidence is lacking. The course covers the main civilizations from 3,500BC through about 900AD. It doesnt cover every single civilization but instead focuses on large civilizations, that dominated for periods of time, and that influenced the civilizations which came after them.",1495670400,,822,5.282442748091603
8553246,2,B008QQ6FKY,"Rather simplistic approach to the history and the meanings it emanates. By watching this series of lectures anybody who understands and thinks about the evolution of culture of human beings on this planet would be astonished that retelling the stories of war, conquest, and glorification of one nation against others won't do justice in exhibiting an unbiased  face of the humanity, nor it would consider that human heritage as we earn today as inhabitant of this planet is not a collective efforts of all nations in course of it. And this wouldn't be possible unless one considers the connections and relations between cultures. Although this relationship may inherently be accompanied by conflicts, humanity has and had devices in the past to overcome this. Otherwise, it would be extinct by now. I would suggest the viewers to read some books about epistemology of history as a discipline and consider that history is not the art of story telling but is a bridge to connect the past to the present for humanity. History is not a disjuncture of events and ballad of conquering powers but indeed it is the explaining the mechanism behind what brings the humanity forward.",1494460800,2,1172,4.979591836734694
