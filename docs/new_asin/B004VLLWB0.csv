4482796,3,B004VLLWB0,"As a diehard SPN fan I was thrilled yet wary when learning they were releasing an anime version of Supernatural. I went into it knowing that Jared did all the voice for Sam on the 22 episodes and was slightly disappointed that Jensen only did two episodes so that wasn't an issue.

After watching the DVD now I can say that diehard fans will probably enjoy it. It does have some very wonderful Pros to list, such as the live introductions between episodes, the music since most fans can say that they missed hearing Carry On Wayward Son in the live action show and it does have an interesting concept on the remake of the episodes.

However, for me it was a couple of things in those remakes that dropped my review level to just a three. Character changes, such as Missouri & Bobby, diminished my enjoyment. It is funny to watch the anime characters but those used to hearing Jensen as Dean may have a hard time acclimating to the change of this voiceover actor.",1311984000,3,962,4.4602272727272725
4482797,5,B004VLLWB0,"I am a 61 year old fan of the live action Supernatural TV series.  Before now, I've never watched anything other than a few bits of anime so I bought this series with a little trepidation.  However, it was well worth the money.  If you aren't familiar with anime it is similar to watching comic book scenes in a 3D format (very simplistic description). However, this anime was so much more.  It is stylized and artistic, with both bold and subtle uses of hard lines, color, and especially shadows.  The characters are also fully developed.  I haven't watched all of the episodes yet, but the ones that I have seen were very well done, artistic, yet easy to watch, and with very good writing.  The episodes based on the live action series do not follow exactly along the same lines, which should keep the fan of the live action series watching and guessing. Each episode is about 30 minutes long.  The new episodes seem to be well written, are in keeping with the original series even expanding on some of the characters we are already familiar with, and they also introduce some new monsters.  With anime, there is more blood and obvious violence and the monsters are much more pronounced and for lack of a better description, monster-like.

The special features are also well worth watching.  I found the two segments on making of the anime to be fascinating.  I had expected most of the anime work to be done on the computer but was surprised at how much of the initial scene development was drawn and edited using pencil and paper.  Some of the feature interviews are a little hard to follow since you have to read the English subtitles, but I thought it was worth the effort, and occasionally J&J or Eric Kripke will add a comment.  There are also extensive interviews (with answers in English, no subtitles) with Eric, Jensen and Jared together, and then each separately.  Even with some repetition in those interviews, they were interesting and worth watching.  J&J also introduce each episode, but don't expect a lot, each intro is only a few seconds long.

The only disconcerting thing for me was the voice over work.  Since Jensen only voiced a couple of episodes (the last two), it is a little weird at first to hear the familar voice of Sam, without the familiar voice of Dean.  After watching a couple of episodes though you get used to it.",1311897600,51,2352,4.624096385542169
4482798,5,B004VLLWB0,"I will admit I was abit skeptical at first about them bringinning out a anime series of such a great show because sometimes when great shows get really big and well known they try to spread it out in to many formats that just ruining the whole thing. But not with the anime series I was thoroughly impressed with the story line and graphics of the series. Yes it was a play off of season one and two but their were also episodes completely based from a whole different approach as well and told more information about a few characters from the show you didn't know. I have been a fan of the live action series pretty much since day one, the story layout for each episode is great. I've also been into anime for a long time so when i heard about a anime series of the show coming I was like any anime fan. Couldnt hurt to take a peak and I was glad I did and so will you. So if your a fan of the show I would definetly try a few episodes out and if your a fan of anime give this series a tryout because after a few episodes you will want to watch the live action series. Its just that good; you will get hooked just like that.",1311897600,2,1125,4.004444444444444
4482799,3,B004VLLWB0,"My first ever review, and I'm writing this as if the reader is already familiar with Supernatural, so...

Yeah, I would only recommend the anime series to a diehard SPN fan, someone who wants to collect every significant scrap of lore.  The show isn't bad, just not necessary.

The show does have some obvious advantages.  They can draw the boys in any locale instead of trying to 'build' it in Vancouver, they can do childhood flashbacks and bring John & Mary into the story as much as they're willing to draw it.  And being anime, the action is more graphic, the gore is bloodier and the monsters are far less human in appearance.

The animated episodes based on certain live-action episodes are all written a little differently to keep you guessing, but really they just remind me how much better the live-action episodes were.  Even some of the cartoon's original scripts feel like retreads of the live-action series.  I think it says something that to me the best episode by far is one that doesn't even feature the brothers: John tracks down another psychic kid and comes face to face with the YED.  That episode more than any other left me feeling like I'd learned something new about this family.

The most irritating part by far is the voice work.  Jared voices Sam, but Jensen doesn't show up to voice Dean until the final two episodes.  The primary voice, Andrew Farrar, isn't bad, but it's a little jarring to hear Jared's voice dialoging with someone who's obviously not Jensen.

If you expect this show to fill in some blanks, or take the brothers' story to places the live-action show didn't or couldn't go, you'll probably be disappointed.  However, if you want to see another version of this fandom brought to life because you just love all things Winchester, then maybe you should check this out.

P.S.: Jared & Jensen personally introduce each episode, and there are bonus feature interviews with both them and Kripke.",1311552000,106,1937,4.75748502994012
4482800,5,B004VLLWB0,"I love this Anime series. Of course I love the live series as well (except for season 6. Don't get me started.) so that didn't hurt either. Jensen Ackles doesn't always do the voice for Dean which made me disappointed at first, but it's still pretty good. Nearly every episode is loosely based on the live show, but in my opinion, it was still easy to follow. I hope they release more of these. I'll be the first in line to buy them.",1311033600,4,433,4.228915662650603
4482801,4,B004VLLWB0,"I must confess, I've only seen two episodes of ""Supernatural."" But when I heard they were making an anime based on the first couple seasons, my interest was piqued -- and the resulting series is a dark, eerie one with golden-eyed demons, splatters of blood, and supernatural mysteries aplenty. The one major downside: at times it feels like you need to have seen the live series to understand what's going on.

Sam and Dean Winchester wander through the U.S., searching for their father and/or supernatural incidents that they can deal with (preferably before anyone gets hurt). Also, they're searching for whatever killed their mother and Sam's first love, Jessica.

Among the things they investigate: a lake monster, a murderous shapeshifter, a girl who may be a werewolf, a troubled young boy with a strange father, a bad luck demon, killer ghosts on a country road, mysterious fires at the old Winchester home, flashbacks to an encounter with ""Bloody Mary,"" the serial-killings of blonde women, an abused boy with a strange power, and others.

But they soon discover that a devil -- a golden-eyed demon -- is following them, and he is linked to Sam and others with similar powers. When they reunite with their estranged father, they discover that there is only one thing that can stop that demon.

""Supernatural: The Anime Series"" is a very dark series: lots of blood, graphic violence, and quite frequently the Winchester boys aren't able to save the people who need it most. Even the lighter episodes -- such as the lake monster episode, or the bad-luck-in-Vegas story -- have some dark undertones, and we never forget that the Winchesters are being faced with demonic evil.

It's even animated darkly -- the sleek, realistic animation is painted in bleak greys, dusty reds and browns, with lots of shadows. The color that sticks out the most is a vibrant red, whether it's blood or something blood-colored.

And while this series was made in Japan, the people who produced it really grasped the dusty, wild feel of the western half of the U.S., but weaved in a lot of eerie supernatural happenings that are genuinely scary (like the black-hole eyes on possessed people). The biggest problem is that sometimes I felt like I was missing something because I hadn't watched the live-action series.

A lot of the character development is lavished on Sam, his angst over the loss of Jessica, his burgeoning psychic powers, and his importance to the golden-eyed demon. Comparatively, Dean's character development is mostly that he's a goofy flirt/buttkicking warrior, and that he promised to take care of his baby brother long ago. As for the voice acting, it's a little clumsy in the first episode, but Jared Padalecki and... whoever plays Dean settle nicely into their roles.

I can't compare it very much to the original series, but ""Supernatural: The Anime Series"" stands pretty well on its own feet. Dark, eerie and beautifully-produced.",1307491200,44,2942,4.977596741344196
4482802,5,B004VLLWB0,"Ive been a fan of Supernatural since day one and being a fan of anime also i thought it was a perfect match. I got an early copy of seasons one and two on dvd that a buddy of mine let me have and im watching it now as i write.  all i have to say is that, if you love the series, you're going to love the anime.  its just as good as the live action series. the same guy who plays Sam is the voice of himself in the anime. i do plan on buying it on blu-ray on release date.",1304812800,15,471,3.563106796116505

I watch both the real version and the anime version.. and I like the anime version. Its different. The story move much faster. So far they are killing lowly demons. No Angles or Highly name Demons yet.
They just trying to find out about why Sam's Mother & Girlfriend was killed the same way. They all are after the Colt(gun) to kill the Yellow eye Demon who they think is responsible for killing the women. They will be united w/ their father and Bob Singer who are hunters.

4482804,3,B004VLLWB0,"When I first heard they were doing an anime, I pretty much ruled it out because I'm not an anime fan. Now I've only seen a few clips here and there and from that I think some of the scenes are really cool and I'm starting to become more interested in watching it.

The only issue I have is that I wish instead of copying actual SPN episodes {even if they changed certain things about it}, they had decided to make them all new. Because why would you want to watch the same episodes in anime format? I just don't get it. And I wish Jensen had been able to voice all the episodes.

HOWEVER,

Like I said, I thought some of the shots were really cool, the trailer made it look exciting and I think overall, it's going to be more hillarious than anything else.

Dean's butt dance is just one example of why.",1302480000,11,803,4.161290322580645

I really just could not get past the poor chemistry between a genuine sounding Sam, and a terribly acted out Dean that didn't even sound like him.

4482911,4,B004VLLWB0,"I am a die-hard fan of Supernatural as well as an anime-lover, so when I learned the two things were being combined I was very excited. But after watching some clips of it on YouTube, I was pretty disappointed in what I saw. The voice actors seemed poorly casted, and the fact that Dean was not voiced by his real-life actor was a huge no-no for me.

Reluctantly, though, I decided to pick up the set and give it a second chance. I actually ended up enjoying this 22-episode set much more than I thought I would, but before picking it up yourself there are a few things you should expect:

1. The English dub is pretty bad.

The story is strong and the episodes are pretty creative, but I had to watch the entire series in Japanese to be able to stomach the dialogue. The main problem for me is that Jensen Ackles, who plays Dean in the live-action show, does not voice Dean in the anime except for the last 3 episodes. When paired with the voice of Jared Padalecki, who plays Sam in the live-action show, it can be very disconcerting. No offense to the guy playing Dean in English - he did his best - but he is just not Jensen. And, I'm sad to say, Jared Padalecki isn't a great voice actor himself. He's phenomenal in the live show, but when he's trying to do a whole scene without actually ""acting it out"" his voice is extremely flat and wooden.

Another issue I had with the English dub is that some of the translations are pretty far off. When I would watch a scene in English and then go back and watch it in Japanese, some sentences aren't even REMOTELY close when translated. I know they had to try and make the mouth movements sync up between languages, but it honestly makes the story a little disjointed sometimes when watching in English.

2. A couple of the important characters' designs have been drastically changed.

For real purists of the show, this might be a bit of an issue. Bobby Singer, rather than looking like real-life actor Jim Beaver, is now a fat, bald, clean-shaven man who constantly wears a fedora instead of a baseball cap and does not own a scrap of plaid clothing, as well as speaking with a slight Brooklyn accent. John Winchester, rather than looking like Jeffrey Dean Morgan, now sports a bald head covered with a black newsboy-cap and wears a long black trenchcoat. And Missouri Moseley, the psychic from the Season 1 episode ""Home,"" has now been made into a squat, eccentric Jamaican stereotype of a psychic who can't be more than 4 feet tall. The Yellow-Eyed Demon Azazel has also been redone, looking a bit like the Supernatural version of Slenderman.

3. Sam and Dean act very out-of-character at times.

In this version of the series, Sam is often very snappy and cynical, way more than he ever is in the show. He often has a quick temper for no apparent reason, another trait that is unlike Sam in the live-action show.

Dean, in this version, is often a bit of a crybaby. I know he has cried often in the live-action show as well, but only under times of extreme duress. In this version, it is almost every episode; sometimes he even cries for comedic effect. He is also characterized as an idiot, often bumbling and clumsy and needing Sam to fix something he messed up during a hunt. I know that Dean is often the comic relief in the live-action show as well, but it's through witty and clever banter; he's never been characterized as an idiot.

All in all, I really enjoyed this 22-episode set. The story follows very closely to the one in the first 2 seasons of Supernatural, with a few plot alterations and new characters, and the art style is very nice to look at. I ended up watching the entire box set within a few days, and I was actually a little sad when it was over.

My advice, to anyone who finds the English dub a little too painful to listen to like I did, is to listen to it exclusively in Japanese with subtitles. That way you can get the full ""anime"" experience, Japanese language included.",1419638400,4,3954,4.432506887052342
4482912,5,B004VLLWB0,"The shorter time on each episode takes a lot of the plot out of the Supernatural series, but this is a fun must have for any Supernatural fanatic. If you haven't seen the original Supernatural series, the anime won't make much sense. The original actor who plays Sam, voices his character in this series. Unfortunately the actor who plays Dean does not voice in this series. This is awkward at first and a bit of a disappointment, but I knew this before buying the DVD. Each episode is preluded by an interview by the actors who play a Sam and Dean, however the interviews do tend to run on quieter volume than the episodes themselves. Animation is awesome, the heart of the show it is still in these episodes.",1419552000,,710,4.511627906976744

4482918,1,B004VLLWB0,"This was disappointingly terrible. Jared Padalecki is okay voicing Sam, but not having Jensen Ackles to voice Dean alongside him really is a tragedy. The chemistry that brought the show to 10 seasons is just absent. Even worse, it's clear that the writers either never watched the TV show or had zero interest in making the anime have anything beyond the most tenuous connection to the world Eric Kripke created. Both brothers are written completely (and painfully) out of character, and Bobby... the character they call Bobby is horrible and bears absolutely no relation to the beloved, crotchety old hunter brought to life by Jim Beaver. Most of the episodes are simply piss-poor retellings of the TV show. Had the creators decided to take this in a better direction (for example, stories of the boys hunting before Sam left for Stanford), it could have been interesting. As it is, it's not worth your time. Just go watch the show again.",1413331200,,939,4.875

4482924,1,B004VLLWB0,"Save your money and just buy future full season releases of the regular series. This might be the ugliest Blu-ray I have ever seen top to bottom. Dean looks like a mentally challenged monkey and John Winchester looks like the captain of a fishing boat that just came into port. I'm not even going to mention what Bobby looks like. Now, I know they didn't want to fork out the money to use the secondary actors' likenesses but man if the animation is not bad enough the characters are. Both Sam and Dean intro the episodes at one time or another but not always together. As someone else mentioned, in another review, Jensen Ackles is plain and simple reading off a cue card for most of the time he's shown. It really looks like a pure cash grab but at least Jared Padalecki did his own voice for the entire series and his episode intros look like he at least memorized the lines.

The animation is also very poorly done. A lot of it looks like that stop motion animation they used for comic books 10 or so years ago. The color is bad and looks really washed out. I swear the entire series was just ported over from a DVD with nothing else done to it. The sound is fair but the only thing that sounds crystal clear is the ending Kansas song. The animated brothers' dialogue comes across as wooden and again feels like a total cash grab.

About 2/3 of the episodes(22 minutes each) were taken directly from the television series(not a bad thing) and just trimmed down. The problem is if you have already seen them in their original 43 or so minute length the cut down versions just don't stack up. I enjoyed a couple of the directly written for the animated series shows but just not enough to recommend this set. The only good thing is the extras are very good but who cares if the main product stinks?

Stay far away from this release even if, like me, you can get it for under $14. Instead just pop season 1 or 2 of the original series into your Blu-ray player and feel thankful you didn't drop a nickel on this turd.",1408752000,3,2017,4.330687830687831

They're just re-hashes of episodes from the TV show, and not all the characters are played by the original actors - for example, Jensen Ackles is only in like, one or two episodes, but Jared Padalecki is in all of them. The animation itself is a lot of still shots and panning of wide angles, with occasional bursts of action. The usual anime droll.

This anime also had the principle players Sam and Dean introduce each story with a little background history.  I would tell anyone that enjoys the CW series SUPERNATURAL to buy it, they will not be disappointed.",1401667200,,435,4.697368421052632
4482933,3,B004VLLWB0,"Disclaimer: I have not seen every anime episode, I've seen five at most. But I have seen every episode of The CW's Supernatural, so work with me here.

When I first heard about the Supernatural anime series, I was a little nervous for it. As a die hard fan of the show, I was interested in how the anime would be done, but I also knew that the live action would always be better.
After watching the first episode of the anime series, I was... amused but not what I would say impressed or motivated to watch the next. The voice actor for Sam was, thankfully, Jared Padalecki, but for the episodes I've seen, Dean's voice actor was noticeably a different person. He sounded like Dean with a horrible head cold. In many places throughout the episode, the dialogue did not match up with the mouths of the characters, and that was a bit distracting. I also noticed that in a few places, the animation was shoddy at best.
On the bright side, in some places, the animation was *very* well done and I loved how they captured a few scenes. The writers did a good job with how the characters and monsters should have acted and spoke, and to me, Sam felt like Sam, and Dean felt like Dean, if that makes sense at all. This anime series was a good idea, and is a great gift idea for a Supernatural fan that might be interested in anime.
(Though I am on the fence as to how I feel about watching the episodes I know by heart as anime. It's different to say the least- the dialouge, how the scenes are carried out, etc.)

Over all, the series is cool and would be awesome for a dedicated fan of the show. But it is not exactly necessary to watch, nor is it exactly riveting, so 3 stars it is. Before buying, watch the first couple episodes on YouTube, or Netflix if they have it. Make sure this is what you're looking for.

And if for some reason you have decided to watch the anime series BEFORE the live-action show, here's a little song that might change your mind. *plays opening piano chord* DON'T.
You will either be really confused about the plot or just turned off from the actual show, and that would be awful.",1400284800,,2105,4.3106060606060606

LOVED IT!! Watching the animation was good, but even better was just listening to it with my eyes closed and imagining them in the recording booth. I don't know if it's just because I love the sound of their voices or because the product is actually good...but I'd recommend these two eps if you're a fan.",1393286400,,489,4.384615384615385

4482942,1,B004VLLWB0,"Supernatural is not a series that should have been turned into an anime series.  While Sam's character was pretty spot on to Jared Padalecki's character, I felt that Dean's character was ruined, (This, not having anything to do with the character's voice actors).

One incident in the show, this showing that mixing anime and supernatural doesn't work, there is a scene where a woman cuts her hand and Dean patches it up with a handkerchief.  A very cliched senitment in numerous animes, but is that something that Dean would really do, at least with a handkerchief?  There was also an episode where Dean was being haunted by a Japanese spirit, a little old man who would appear sitting and drinking and laughing.  I know the description doesn't seem to farfetched but if you watch it, you'd understand.

Unless you are a HUGE fan of Supernatural (and I consider myself a HUGE fan)  and require every bit of Supernatural merchandise ever created, I don't think you need to add this one to your collection.",1391299200,,1005,4.77456647398844

They changed some things around in here, so it's not going to be exactly what you see in the actual series, but it's a great addition to the collection.",1391126400,2,511,4.302083333333333

4482947,3,B004VLLWB0,"As a standalone I think the series is okay. But having approached it after marathoning the live action show for two weeks straight made it difficult not to draw direct comparisons. Obviously since the run time is a lot shorter than the live action the remake episodes drastically reduce some content that might be considered essential to the episode. Some of the remake episodes feel too short, or rushed to get the the punchline, which I felt like I could handle or at least was prepared for since I know the story line already, but for newcomers to the series it might difficult to follow everything without getting a little lost in the remake episodes.

I found it hard to get over Dean's voice actor. I was so used to Jensen Ackles that the first three episodes had me cringing every time anime Dean opened his mouth. I got used to it over time, but this makes it hard for me to marathon like I usually do with anime.

The voice acting for Sam by Jared Padalecki was great though. It really helped me get into this series.

Some other review mentioned how the anime original episodes were just rehashes of the original episodes, and I think to an extent this is true. There are a couple truly original episodes, like the Las Vegas episode or the Kappa episode, but even if the episode isn't taken directly from the series, they do reuse the concepts or the lore like with Bloody Mary.

In any event, I enjoyed this series enough to watch the entire thing, and enjoy a few if not most of the episodes.",1388707200,,1504,4.458181818181818

4482952,4,B004VLLWB0,"I was initially skeptical about watching Supernatural: The Anime Series, but too curious not to check it out. I'm glad I did, because I found it thoroughly entertaining and surprisingly endearing.

The series mostly consists of a slightly modified retelling of the first two seasons of Supernatural with added anime flare. While well done, the retelling felt very rushed at times, but it's somewhat expected when you realize that they're cramming roughly 44 hour long episodes into a 22 half-hour long episodes. However, there were a number of episodes that were not simply reenactments of the original series and they are what really stood out. Many of these episodes provided fans with new background information on significant characters that were not well fleshed out in the Original series. This is really what made it worth watching.

The animation was top-notch. All of the characters were all well designed-drawn and in more Americanized anime style, if that makes sense. What stood out for the animation were the dark and ominous environments and settings. It was very effectively at portraying the dread from the first two seasons of the original series. The darkness of the series kind of reminded me of the batman cartoons series from the 90s.

The English voice acting was generally excellent, led by a pretty strong effort by Jared Padalecki. I was actually pretty impressed with how much effort he seemed to put into this. The anime series seemed to follow Sam's character more centrally. The voice actor filling in for Dean did a good job, but you could tell that it wasn't Jensen Ackles. Jensen does voice Dean for the last two epsiodes, which I found equal parts odd and exciting. If it hadn't been for the fact that Jared voiced Sam, then I would have said that they Japanese audio track was superior, especially for non main characters. Japanese voice actors carry an enthusiasm to there work that few English counterparts can match.

The soundtrack was a little light, but they managed to pull a few good tracks in. Most notable was Carry on my Wayward Son by Kansas, which appropriately closed out each episode. However, if you'll probably be sick of the song by the time you're done watching, because it gets a little overused. You can tell the music budge for the series wasn't a big priority.

All-in-all, if you were a big fan of the original series and/or an anime fan, then you should check this series out.",1376870400,11,2435,4.857831325301205
4482953,3,B004VLLWB0,"I love the live action Supernatural show!  I enjoy some anime, generally the darker stuff.  The idea of turning Supernatural into an anime was, for me, a wonderful and natural idea.  Being able to release the world of Supernatural from the limits of a live action budget opens so many possibilities.  But, I feel it was wasted here.

While it is visually powerful at times, it is not the level of stunning, awe inspiring, demonic fury that it could and should have been.  It is far to vanilla, too airbrushed, too safe.  This is an excellent example of popular anime but there is nothing special about it.  It does not push boundaries, at all.  I feel Supernatural was a rule breaker and the anime should have been as well.

While this anime did not fall prey to what in my opinion kills so many others, that being heartless crap music, the music most often used was ""Carry On Wayward Son"".  A good choice but as a diehard fan of Supernatural, that one is ONLY used for the season's climax.  I am thankful that some garbage pop track was not used but that one is too special to get the use it got.  That said, I do understand why someone would select that track.  I just disagree with how it is used.

The stories were interesting.  Twelve of them are based on episodes of the live action show.  I did not know it would be that many.  I think six or eight would have been enough.  Even the ""original"" stories took elements from episodes just not as much.  I would have liked more new stories.  Having these appear to be stories that happened in between episodes of the live action show would have been more appealing to me and I think it would have drawn anime fans to the live action show.

Ok, Dean's voice...Yes, Jensen Ackles did not do most of the voice work for Dean.  Yes I noticed it.  I tried really hard not to dwell on it but it was very difficult to get around.  I missed Jensen and having Jared Padalecki in every episode, while wonderful, only emphasized the fact that we really didn't get our favorite brothers together.

Overall, this is a solid example of popular anime.  It is however, not exceptional.  I want something darker with more spectacular visuals.",1375920000,,2176,4.4543147208121825
4482954,4,B004VLLWB0,The very first thing you will notice is this is not a 5 star review. What is holding this back is the lack of Jensen Eckles. The fact that he is not doing the voice of Dean for all but the last two episodes is a bit distracting. If you are a big fan of Supernatural you will also notice that a lot of the episodes feel very familiar where I was wishing for a little bit more new content. One other minor complaint is the treatment of Bobby. He was kind of a fat little annoying man instead of the Heroicly awesome father figure that kept the Winchester Boys on the right path all these years.  Having said that this still feels like Supernatural when it comes to the story. The Anime is beautiful and there are several episodes that are totally new. There is one episode that is the typical HILARIOUS supernatural episodes as well. It is a much watch for any fans of Supernatural.,1375401600,4,880,4.269461077844311

The actual series though is pretty good, the voice actor for Dean isn't Ackles, but you get used to it.  There's a short introduction before each episode given by Ackles and Padelecki, explaining and giving their thought about the episode.  I really like the series, it's not in total anime style, more comic book, but it fits well with the series.

Friends...it was the worst ten dollars I ever spent.

The only thing the anime has in common with the show is Jared as Sam. Well crafted story lines take tragic, painful, avoidable blows in a well meant but poorly executed attempt to make this its own creature. The art is fine, nothing distinctive or memorable, but as long as you focus your eyes off to the left of the impala and never look directly at it or the constant blank idiot expression on Dean's face you'll enjoy it for a couple of episodes before it just blurs into mediocrity. The other voice actors are stilted and Jared is just so *huge* that his voice coming from anime! Sam just kind of sounds like Sam is pretending to be Batman. John Winchester looks like actor Reg E. Cathey dressed as the Gordon fisherman, I'm not sure why Bobby looks the way he does (really, it's sad) and if someone could tell me why Bobby Singer owns a helicopter I'd be thrilled. Also, Jensen only does the voice of Dean for the last two episodes, which covers the Cold Creek story arc that ends S2.

I sat down to watch it expecting familiar characters, a neat re-imagining of a story I knew, and some crazy anime-style blood and guts and scary demons. Instead I got a tamer, less cohesive tragically disappointing version of one of my favorite shows. I don't recommend it to Supernatural fans who are hoping for a codas and fill-ins between those Season 1 and 2 cases. I do however, recommend it to Supernatural fans with a great sense of humor and 10-15 dollars of disposable income who need a new Supernatural drinking game to pass the time until the premiere of Season 8.",1348272000,,1862,4.43859649122807

The look of the chars is significantly different too, so  that is jarring. I think if you like japanese anime, understand that it is their version of Supernatural not the Americanized series, you will be OK. If you don't, you will hate it. I have not decided if I will watch the whole series.

4482980,3,B004VLLWB0,"Honestly this anime adaption to the live action tv series is much better in my opinion, however the only real problem I have with this is the voice acting. I know someone reading this will say ""Oh, he just wants the Japanese voices."" Wrong. I always prefer to watch a series in English if able to, but the voice actors in this case are well... very poor. The English voices barely match the movements of a characters mouth, sometimes it's sad to see how off it is. So to get around this I tried the Japanese voice track, which was much better, voices matched the mouths almost perfectly, there was actual effort put into voicing these characters, however if you cannot speak Japanese I recommend you return this or get used to the English dub. Why? There are no English subtitles. ""But the description says there are"". Well there are English subtitles, but... they're for the hearing impaired, so you get to see the names for characters speaking popping up, the sound effects, just about everything is subtitled. There's no basic English track, just that and about 4 other subtitle tracks that are fine. It would've been fine if there was a normal English subtitle track as well but there isn't.

4482983,4,B004VLLWB0,"Supernatural is a show I've been watching since its premier and have been in love with since it hit the ground running. From the lore, to the characters, to the locations dotting our tattered map, there's little there that isn't to love. So when I heard that Supernatural would be coming in the form of an Anime series, by one of my favorite anime production companies (Madhouse), I was as close to doing backflips as I could ever manage to urge my body to. However, I think I was unrealistically hoping for a little bit more, or maybe a little different, then I actually got from the animated series.

I did happen to wait a while for it to come down in price, because I'm a bit of a bargain hunter that way, but now that I've watched it a few times I'm pretty sure that I made the right choice to wait. Its not to say the Anime version of my beloved show is bad -its far from bad- its just a decidedly different spin on the mythos, characters and really the entire tone of the series.

The Animation takes place within seasons 1 and 2 of the main series, with the overarching plot threads of both those seasons pretty much intact. This was a good thing for me as a fan, because I never felt lost when it came to the storyline, even if it may have been nice to have a completely different story all together. But where the plot remains the same most of the episodes are completely different, if not completely original to this series. And this brings about mixed results.

Having gone back and watched the first two seasons after seeing this, you can tell which episodes were lifted from the original for the anime, and its a refreshing new coat of paint for many of them. Most, if not all, of their story and scripts seemed in tact, if a bit edited down for time and format (seeing as each episode of this is only 23 minutes or so) and the changes made to these stories are hardly the worst thing that could happen in the world. Actually, I found I liked the ending to one of the anime episodes much better then the live action series(but this result wasn't the norm across the board).

Where the set really takes a spin in an irregular direction is the original episodes. These episodes generally try to flesh out story bits that we otherwise never see in the original series, like, as an example, a little more about the other ""blessed"" children that end up in the ghost town (which was more of a post apocalyptic cityscape here. Very, Japanese. Very Anime) fighting to survive the night and become old Yellow Eye's general, with Sam. This series also tells you a little more about what John Winchester is doing while he's avoiding the boys. All of which is a nice thing to see if it wasn't for how the tone of these original episodes didn't shift the whole feel of the show from quirky and melodramatic, to decisively, almost gut-wrenchingly, hardline dramatic. It works, but it just doesn't feel right with the Supernatural name branded on it. One episode, in which Sam and Dean head to Vegas (which is a trip mentioned in one of the episodes early on in the live action series, that we never see) adds a bit of lighthearted levity to the whole back of tricks, but feels awkward amongst everything else.

The other thing that makes these original episodes stand out is the fact that, for the most part, these episodes use very Japanese centered folklore to provide an antagonist and story. This, was a bit of a double edge sword for me. In one case I liked it, because I greatly appreciate Japanese culture, specially when I have the opportunity to learn something new about it and its folklore. But in the other case, the case of watching it with someone who loves the original series as much as I do, but doesn't really know or care all that much about Japanese culture, it became a bit of a pain, because, like most things in Supernatural, the ins and outs of the lore were glossed over, but ultimately because of the time frame we're given to watch the story unfold, we're left with even half the usual understanding of the lore by the end. This raised a lot of questions from my friend, and many of which I couldn't answer, simply because I was new to that piece of folklore. Its hardly enough to jump to the conclusion and say ""Don't watch the series!"" but its something to keep in mind when it happens, just so you don't wrinkle your nose too hard --if anything it'll have you on google the next day.

Also, I feel like it needs to be mentioned for the sake of mentioning, and it maybe a nitpick, the idea of having things VERY rooted in Japanese culture and folklore, making the very Japanese mark they do in any American setting, without the express notion that this -whatever- was carried here or drifted here from the far east, really does make these things feel out of place. I respect the need to appeal to the place where this version of the show first aired, I just wish that when it was dubbed over for American audiences they snuck in more nods to how these things might have made it state side, given that things that were generally not strictly American legend didn't really end up showing up in the live action series till about after season 5.

Other then this the series takes new directions with some of the characters. You won't really recognize John Winchester or Bobby Singer (and Bobby takes a larger role it feels like, earlier on, but this maybe because of the melding of the two seasons into one whole). It doesn't hurt the series to see a change in them, but its a little hard to get used to at first. You'll recognize Dean, but if your like me you'll think they went a little too heavy on his boyish looks and not enough on the rugged side Jensen often brings. Sam, well.. Is Sam. They pretty much nailed him.

Speaking of, don't expect to hear the original cast dubbing this series. The only actor from the original series who came for the full run of the anime was Jared Padalecki. Supposedly the story goes that due to scheduling conflicts Jensen Ackles couldn't voice Dean for more then two episodes. His replacement, Andrew Farrar, does a good job, but knowing it wasn't Jensen really made it stand out to me that it wasn't really Dean talking. Farrar sounds close enough, but you notice he needs time to get comfortable with it across a few of the first episodes, and he doesn't quite have down all of Jensen's inflections. You also won't realize till you hear it how much those inflections really matter to Dean's character, if you watch this against the live action series. Otherwise, to go with their new looks, characters like Bobby get totally new voices and for the most part I feel they fit the bill.

Overall, this series will provide you a good could nights of entertainment if your a fan of the show, and may confuse you a little if your not-so-up on the show as is. The animation is great and the voice cast is solid, and the episodes where it fills in the blanks are a nice edition despite some of the inconsistency you might find between the tone of this series over that of the live action one. If you can manage to get it at a good price (I wouldn't pay over $25, if its fair to put such a thing in a review) you'll probably be pretty pleased with what you get.",1331510400,13,7220,4.414414414414415

Having Padalecki do the voice in some episodes certainly helps. However, the rest of the cast is unrecognizable, especially big brother Dean Winchester. As played by Jensen Ackles on the show Dean is gorgeous, with dark blond hair and moss green eyes. For some reason the Japanese animators were unwilling or unable to spend the time to draw Mr. Ackles correctly, and it shows. Anime Dean looks like Kermit the Frog with Don King's hairstyle.

Well, some excuse is better than none at all, I guess.

On the show Dean pretends to be a shallow macho man. He actually cares deeply about people and became a hunter to spare others from the hell his family went through.

4482992,2,B004VLLWB0,"Supernatural is too American for Japanese animation.  I realized this immediately upon watching this series.  They've done all right recreating some of the important elements, but what is missing is the ""cool"" factor.  They are very smart, those Japanese animators, but I'd be willing to bet they've never been the cool kid on the playground.  I know it's the age of the Geek, but you have to know your audience.  Americans have been influenced (whether or not they are old enough to remember them) by Elvis, James Dean, Brando (pre-insanity), the Harley Davidson...you know, rebellion.  That is why Sam is done fairly well, but Dean?  Nope.  Not even close.  Another perfect example of this is the episode in which a spirit Impala goes on a rampage.  The writers expect you to believe that on any given day, there are three or four '67 Impalas driving the streets of a one horse town.  It's not a Honda Civic for God's sake, it's a mint condition 1967 Chevy Impala.  How many of those does a person see in a lifetime?  Strangely enough, with exception of the Impala thing, the original episodes are quite a bit better than the ones based on actual SPN episodes, but still it seems to have lost something in the translation.  I will say this though, I did laugh a lot while watching these episodes.  The sad thing is, I don't think that's what the writers meant to happen.",1323734400,3,1372,4.634854771784233

The animation is very good, pleasing to watch. Most of the stories are originals, that somehow fill in back story or tell stories about characters in the series that you did not know about before. For instance, there is a story about Sam's fiance, as a child, she was at a sleep over where the kids summoned Bloody Mary. Then 10 years later to the day, while in college, her friends each start dying off. Sam meets her during this time, with all the craziness of her friends being killed. Then there is a lot of back story with their father, John.

The good and the bad of it is this: the original stories are excellent and add to the mythos and the remakes of previously aired live-action epsidoes are well done too.  However, the 22 minute episodes are killer.  It feels that you are being rushed through the story.  Lastly, the way they drew Bobby Singer and John Winchester is hard to stomach.  Jim Beaver and Jeffery Dean Morgan are naturally better looking i.e. character wise and better actors than the animators were able to produce.

Most of the episodes are regurgitated story-lines from season one and two of the live action series, except for the ones that deal with Japanese mythos. My love for the original show made me watch the entire anime. I don't recommended it, try to just watch the Japanese mythology ones. I feel that my time has been wasted by watching it, I don't know what I would have done if i had bought it. I had expected it to be episodes that could go in-between the first season's, other hunting tales that Kripke couldn't fit in. Instead approximately only 2 episodes are original plots.",1317254400,3,765,4.4714285714285715
4483001,1,B004VLLWB0,"As a major fan of both anime and Supernatural, I had high hopes for this series. I sat down to watch it with a smile on my face and hope in my heart. I held onto these as long as I could, but after a few episodes I had to be honest with myself, and face up to my disappointment.

This anime doesn't capture anything of the feeling of Supernatural. The colours are garish. The music is cheesy and inappropriate. The acting has no subtlety (unlike most reviewers here, I listened to the Japanese audio). There is none of the affection for the characters that you'd expect from the live action series. There is no wry low-key humour. Dean is now a cry-baby, and Bobby, for no good reason, is a short fat clean-shaven nebbish instead of a cool cracker with a beard. John is a mean SOB, with beard and hat. Only Sam still resembles the live-action character.

This isn't just a case of me not being able to accept Supernatural in a new format. Purely as anime, this show is also mediocre. In the featurette, the Japanese directors say they hired a TV writer because they didn't want the usual anime writing. Cut to a story conference in which the writer is fighting to get in ONE LINE that will give the monster of the week some sort of motivation. If you watch that episode (Alter Ego, the remake of Skin), you'll see that he did not get the line in.

But the writing in general is poor. The plots are simplistic (and the plots of the ""anime originals"" are in fact mostly derived from pre-existing episodes). The directors say this is because of the short episode length, but anime fans will know that plenty of story and character can be fitted into the standard 23 minutes. When the dialog is not just blandly generic, Sam and Dean engage in awful gag-based banter (apparently cartoon Sam just HATES being called Sammy - hilarious!). Thankfully, the wacky attempts at humour mostly disappear about halfway through the series (after the one effective episode, which doesn't even feature Sam and Dean), making the show more tolerable, but still not actually good.

What would a better anime version of Supernatural have looked like? Maybe a bit like Stand Alone Complex, or Witch Hunter Robin, or even Boogiepop Phantom, but obviously with a bit more ironic humour. Instead we get something that can only only lower the reputation of anime in the West, and of Supernatural in the East. A stupid, cheesy cartoon for kids. An embarrassment to both Kripke's show and the anime industry.

I realise that writing such a negative review will garner a few unhelpful votes. I thought long and hard before writing this, and giving what I believe is my lowest ever Amazon review score. I'm only doing this because I want people to have an alternative to the relentlessly positive reviews here. Obviously, if you are a hardcore Supernatural fan, you will have to buy this series. I understand that. I just want you to be aware of what you are getting into, before you get your hopes too high, like I did, and then suffer a terrible disappointment.",1317081600,46,3032,4.597042513863216
4483002,1,B004VLLWB0,"First of all, let me just say that I love 'Supernatural'. I think Eric Kripke is a genius. I think Jensen Ackles and Jared Padalecki are great, good looking actors. I am already dreading the day that this program leaves the airwaves.

So because of all of this, I was quite excited at the concept of an anime version of this show. I was even more interested when I heard that Jared and Jensen would be doing the voice work.

Imagine my surprise to find that for one: many of the episodes were just old episodes from the actual show, that had been redone in anime. Watching episodes that you know by heart, in animation, isn't cool. Not at all.

Imagine my surprise to discover that Jensen Ackles doesn't do the voice work for most of the episodes, and some guy named Jeffrey Farrar, who sounds like Jensen with a very bad cold, is 'Dean'. That made viewing the actual original episodes, even worse.

Actually, let me correct myself: what made the whole thing worse, was Jensen appearing before most episodes, to introduce them, as if he had anything to do with them at all.

I would suggest renting from NetFlix or somewhere, before investing in this DVD. I think customers/fans will know after watching the first episode, if this series was worth investing in.",1316304000,11,1261,4.586666666666667

First of all, any Jensen Ackles fans will hate the series. Despite being one of the main characters for the series, he only does voice work for the last three episodes. This wouldn't be bad if it wasn't for two things. 1) the actor the employed to take his place, well, doesn't do a very good job. 2) Jensen actually does intros for three out of the first five episodes, not to mention he is no stranger to voice acting considering he had roles in Batman: Under the Red Hood and Tron: Evolution. That's right, he did voice acting for a video game based off of a movie. Anyways, the worse part is that most of the episodes so far have been animated copies of episodes from the first and second seasons. So, imagine your favorite episodes from those seasons shortened to 20 minutes and without one of the brothers. Begin to understand why it's such a bad idea? I only recommend this for extreme anime fans, and then, I probably still wouldn't recommend it. Watch at your own peril!",1315267200,8,1136,4.440191387559809
4483004,5,B004VLLWB0,"As a fan of both Supernatural and anime, I awaited the release of these DVDs like I used to wait for Christmas morning when I was a kid--but unlike Christmas morning, I was not disappointed when I got these DVDs. I almost don't want to watch all the way to the end, because then it's over!

Now, this is anime, and it was made in Japan, so sometimes (as always happens in anime) the characters over-react to certain situations in a very un-American way, but that's an anime thing, and I love it anyway. It was wonderful that Jared Padalecki voiced Sam, and I haven't gotten to the ones with Jensen Ackles yet (the last two episodes), but I did eventually get used to the non-Dean voice--and Andrew Farrar did a good job.

One thing I miss--the music!  Aside from Carry On My Wayward Son (which they use on the end titles), there is no classic rock, no southern rock anthems, none of the Winchester boys' music! I miss it, but not enough to spark any real complaints or make me stop watching.

If you're not an anime fan but love Supernatural, you're going to love this series. It has all the main ingredients--Sam, Dean, the Impala, monsters and ghosts. They remade some of the live-action episodes, making them different enough to keep them interesting, but not taking away from the actual story-lines (one exception was ""Moonlight"" which was based on ""Heart"" from the second season--it was good, but no where near as heart-wrenching as the original). They also added in some episodes that were based on the comics (which I'm now dying to read), and also some anime complete originals. And in case you're wondering which is which, Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles do quick intros to each episode. I'll bet that once you watch this series, you'll want to look into other anime.

If you're an anime fan but have never watched Supernatural, this is a great introduction to the Winchesters' world. And it has a different look than most anime, with its use of shadows and light, the color pallet and the look of most of the characters, while at the same time preserving what makes Japanese anime wonderful--characters that are not bland or cookie-cutter, who show emotion in their faces and stances, and are most definitely NOT cartoons.

First should be obvious since with animation the show has fewer limitations and can pull of some really cool scenes and monsters/demons etc. Another huge plus of this anime are the original anime episodes, the remakes of the live action are pretty good to though, but the anime exclusive episodes really make this dvd worth while. If I had any minor gripes with the series it is that the way episodes are condensed it seems like that sometimes the emotional aspect of the live action is a little lacking. Also at times if you have not seen the live action some of the things happening in the anime will be a little confusing. Like I said these are very minor gripes and really do not take away from my overall enjoyment of this series.

Being an half hour shorter those episodes actually work as well as the original ones they are based off of.

It's not often that a live action TV series would become an anime, so I imagine this was a great honor for not only the main actors, but the creator Eric Kripke as well. The animation looks well done with beautiful backgrounds and although the live action Sam and Dean have a more in depth relationship, the anime brothers are well done and stories are entertaining. I really liked that they were able to get Jared Padalecki to do the English voice for Sam and even though Jensen Ackles was only able to do two episodes, Andrew was a fair substitute for Dean.

Some of the stories are original and some are based on stories in seasons one and two.  But even the ones that were based on TV episodes were done creatively and still original enough that it just felt like a deleted scenes episode or something like that.  I especially enjoyed the fact that the animation allows them to expand on some of the effects of the monsters; the skinwalker and werewolf were really good and could never have been done this way without big movie budget.

They also had some interesting original stories and back-stories on characters (like Meg Masters) that were great and felt like they enhanced the storyline that was already established.

I would say the only things I found disappointing about it was the little things that I love about Supernatural.  Seeing Dean in that quilted jacket instead of the leather was disconcerting and took away from his characterisation for me.  I found myself struggling to accept the voice of Andrew Farrar as Dean not only because he didn't sound like the Jensen Ackles Dean that I have grown to love, but he just didn't hit the mark sometimes on portraying the Dean-ness of Dean.  The last two episodes where Jensen does the vocals was much more satisfying and I wish he had done the entire series. But there were also times that I felt Jared was a little weak on playing Sam here as well, so I'm assuming that it was perhaps due to the director.  The dialogue is at times a little cheesy as anime can be and a few times I felt like the TV Sam or Dean might not have said/done that, but it was pretty minimal.

Jared and Jensen do little intros before each episode and some are awkward and even poorly filmed, so I felt like those could have been done better and really enhanced the video collection here.

Overall, this kept the spirit of the television show and the animation was beautiful and definitely made this a necessary addition to any Supernatural collection.  I hope they plan to continue it on and do the rest of the seasons as well.",1314316800,,2144,4.525906735751295
4483013,5,B004VLLWB0,"I have to admit I was excited to hear that Supernatural was getting animated, but, at the same time, I was somewhat hesitant to watch it.  I am a supernatural fan and I watch anime, but, when a live series gets converted into animation or vis versa, sometimes the elements that make the show good gets lost.  Regardless, I pre-ordered the discs and found that I was pleasantly surprised.

If there is one word to describe this anime series, it is dark.  Not that Supernatural the TV series is supposed to be all ""sunshine and roses,"" the animation gives a dark, eerie atmosphere.  I guess it helped that animations do not have some of the limitations that performing live do.  From the skin walker bursting out of human skin to fights on top of a high-story building, the animated series definitely had more freedom with the sceneries, settings, and monsters.  Of course, there are some funny moments in the series too.  I watched the ""The Spirit of Vegas"" in dubbed and Japanese English-subtitled.  Personally, I thought that the Japanese version was funnier because some of the sounds that were present in the Japanese version were missing in the dubbed.

Though viewers will have a richer experience watching the live supernatural series first, the animated series is not a repeat of the live series and can stand on its own.  Yes, the episodes based on the live series do follow story line they are based from with some changes and, yes, it does end with ""All Hell Breaks Loose,"" the last episode of season 2.  However, with the two original episodes that introduce supernatural characters from Japanese mythology and the other original episodes and characters mixed in, the animated series could be viewed as an alternative story that follows the same core of season 1 and 2--two brothers, on the road, hunting monster while trying to find and destroy the yellow-eyed demon--and that explores the backgrounds and motivations of some characters who were not stressed in the live series.  On that note, I would definitely recommend this series for anyone who wants to see side stories to the live series or just plain enjoy anime.  Oh but be forewarned some of the animated versions of the characters take some getting used to (example: bobby).  Hope there will be a second animated set.",1314316800,,2290,4.820971867007673
4483014,5,B004VLLWB0,"It was a great buy.  I love Supernatural, and my girlfriend loves Anime, so we found the best of both worlds.
It is very well made, but intense fans of the t.v. series may be put off not by the big storyline changes, but the little ones.
But once you get used to it, this is a great anime to add to any collection.
I look forward to the next one!",1314230400,,346,3.8732394366197185
4483015,4,B004VLLWB0,"Some people in the series look different. Others take greater or lesser roles. Some episodes were based off the TV series episodes directly, others were anime originals. With that in mind I still think it was very true to the source material. Thumbs up from a Supernatural fan. (well up to season six anyhow :P )",1314144000,,312,4.589285714285714
4483016,3,B004VLLWB0,"Okay, so I watched a few episodes and just saw the one Bobby is first seen in.  WHAT THE HELL!  He looks nothing like the Bobby from the show nor does he act like him.  Bobby Singer is a tough SOB that doesn't take any crap.  But this Bobby looks like a washed up car salesman.",1314057600,,277,3.892857142857143
4483017,5,B004VLLWB0,"This is a great buy for a few reasons. One it covers season one with its own twists and original little things, and has original stories to fill in certain unanswered things like how sam met jessica and about meg. This being an anime allows them to use flashy stuff liek with the shapeshifter since the live action's budget doesn't allow for much according to eric kripe. It has orginal story and the ones from the show with cool twists and the animation is just freaking awesome. For any anime fan they know most male characters don't have eyelashes sinc eit ia taboo in anime but in her they added it for sam and dean to give them the hotness, no homo. Also shadows with detail and full black added which most anime don't do, and the characters are detailed unliek most anime where they are simple figures colored in n all. just watch the speacial feature on the dvd to see what i mean. I could go on, but overall great buy and entertaining. Only one problem, even thoguh jared voices sam whole 22 ep jensen only voices last 2, but that is ok because the guy who does the first 20 isn't bad. Hope this helped, and help out supernataurl by buying this so they can make more. thanks.",1312329600,,1183,4.357466063348416
4483018,5,B004VLLWB0,"""Supernatural: The Anime Series"" is well-worth owning, believe me! I signed up with Amazon to buy it as soon as it was released and for good reason.  The whole ""Supernatural"" (SPN) anime project is the first of its kind -- no other current, live American television show has been animated before. If you are a fan of either the live or anime entertainment genres -- or both --you will love this superb addition to your SPN collection.

Season 7 of ""Supernatural"" will premier on September 23, 2011, over The CW Network.  This Mad House-produced anime is based upon Seasons 1 and 2, and while covering the known, live-action story lines, it also contains some really great original episodes (back stories, usually), as well as some interesting variations that are surprising and enjoyable. It will carry SPN fans through the long wait for Season 7 with ""style and grace,"" not to mention a lot of fun!

The animation itself is superb in my opinion; it is a unique and special improvement on the usual Japanese anime or ""manga"" -- with jaw-dropping, guts-and-gore effects that are big and graphic, coupled with lyrically beautiful color, contrast, detail, and backgrounds worthy of a Hiroshige print.

Jared Padalecki voices ""Sam"" for all 22 episodes; Jensen Ackles voices ""Dean"" in Episodes 21 and 22 (""All Hell Freezes Over, Parts I and II"").  Andrew Farrar is ""Dean"" for Episodes 1 through 20, and he does a credible job. Best part is that Jensen and Jared personally introduce each episode, sometimes as a team, but most often singly.

The 3-disk set contains lots of special features, but the most fun are interviews with creator Eric Kripke and with Jared and Jensen -- either singly or together. The back office work done by Mad House is also very interesting.  All of the principals involved in this project are able to give full accounts of how the SPN anime project came to be and what they think of it.  The special features should not be ignored.

Enjoy the ""Supernatural"" anime; I sure did!",1312156800,,2000,4.80466472303207

The packaging however, was damaged. It looks like the top of the case was sliced with a box cutter and the cardboard cover is rubbed white on the edges. I'm disappointed about that seeing as how much I paid for it, but I'm also noticing that I am not the only one who expirienced this according to the other reviews.
