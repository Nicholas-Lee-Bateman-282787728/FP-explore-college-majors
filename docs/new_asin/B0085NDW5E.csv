8525675,5,B0085NDW5E,I once had this on VHS. Wanted to have it on CD. It is very good. A masterpiece of the French silent era. On a side note there is a even better version of this film sold by BFI. This set has four discs and a music score by Carl Davis. I own that version too.  But you will not be unhappy with version of Napoleon. The choice is yours. A film worth having in you DVD collection.,1499731200,2,377,3.8333333333333335
