8646449,2,B00IYLX1QC,"Im a huge fan of the NGDB and there is  surprisingly  very little of them on home video. There are a couple of releases but none capture a live performance. So, I had hopes that this release who fill that gap. I knew when I got it that is was an old concert and that the titles would probably be chopped off. This is standard from titles from the Laser Media label. Sometimes I can tell the source, but not this time.

The hour-long concert was recorded in Oklahoma (you learn that from the stage patter) and it is certainly not more recent than the 1980s. John McEuen still had brown hair!  There are titles of each song on the screen to this was obviously recorded for release. The aspect is the old 4:3  standard TV image. The quality of the visuals is fuzzy and the lighting is dark. The sound is tinny (particularly during McEuens Arkansas Traveller Medley). And there is a buzz.

The band obviously knew it was being recorded but they seem to be a bit off that night. The show is not very tight and, at one point, they do chat-fill while one member is tuning.  But there is one particularly entertaining moment. For an extended version of Ripplin Water each of the band gets a long instrumental solo, showing off their chops.  Ive sen the NGDB play live at least three times and this does capture what they do best. It just does it poorly.
So, I agree with the other reviewer that this is not what we hoped would be a good DVD, but Im adding one star more because of that Ripplin Water segment. Still, the best I can give is two stars.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

This footage has no identification with no title or end credits at all and the origin of the footage is never identified either by year or where it was being played, as to that...the footage is terrible. The sound quality is awful with a constant feedback buzzzzzzz in the background and it looks like someone filmed it in the audience. The stage looks like it was a gig in someones High School Gym and sounds no better, there is scant showing of the audience in any shots and can barely be heard at the end of the numbers. As far as I could tell it might of been a crowd of 30 friends or roadies during a warm-up, the numbers are very unpolished and the sound system was a assemblage of stage amps only...the only clue was on the drum kit it said "" The Dirt Band "" so it was filmed during the time period they used this as the group name instead of Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The purchase price for this disc is outrageous for what basically looks like a You-Tube download and I have got to believe the band would of never officially endorsed this horrible footage as a official release...definitely avoid this mess.",1401840000,5,1241,4.262711864406779
