2522291,5,B000ELJA60,"This documentary will make you want to quit your day job and become a rock star...even if you're a Physicist who only listens to Chopin.  It's an intelligent, thoughtful, and insightful glimpse into a world that most of America knows little about.  You're taken on a journey that will change the way you think about music, life, and living your ""bliss.""  It's filled with the highs, lows and anticipation only found in true life.",1146182400,13,429,4.77027027027027
2522292,5,B000ELJA60,THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENTARY.  ANOTHER GIRL WHO DIED BEFORE HER TIME. I STILL LISTEN TO THE ONE RECORD THEY PUT OUT  ALL THE TIME.  HAD TO OWN THE MOVIE.,1425340800,,152,4.0
2522293,5,B000ELJA60,"I fell in love with these girls 6 years ago. Been listening ever since. If you want to understand the intricate and amazing story behind how this band came about as well as what events led to their demise. Please purchase this DVD. Plenty of good interviews as well as great exclusive recording clips included in the documentary. If you love Betty Blowtorch, you will not be disappointed.",1424390400,,388,4.720588235294118

2522297,5,B000ELJA60,Great insight into a real woman! I'm just sorry I hadn't heard of Betty Blowtorch prior to hearing a cover of one of their songs by Faster Pussycat. The documentary leaves you wanting more.,1399248000,,189,4.588235294117647
2522298,5,B000ELJA60,This movie made me want to start a band and light things on fire. What more could you want. It also really breaks down the importance of size.,1394064000,,142,4.107142857142857
2522299,5,B000ELJA60,"Bianca's Death =Tragic accident... Having it preserved for posterity on film = Kismet
When I see the TRIPE they pass off as ""reality"" TV, I think to myself, ""It doesn't get any more real than this""
The ""Vanilla Ice"" studio segment made Me laugh 'til I cried.
Get this Movie; Show Your friends; You'll be a better person...",1387670400,3,322,4.568965517241379
2522300,5,B000ELJA60,"This DVD rules !!! It fills in some details from their lives prior to the accident.
Hard and heavy jamming women !!!! What could be sweeter? BUY IT !!!!",1364428800,,152,4.275862068965517
2522301,5,B000ELJA60,"Packed to the brim with deleted scenes, after-the-fact interviews, music videos, easter eggs and, best of all, MULTIPLE AUDIO COMMENTARY TRACKS.  All that and the movie ain't half bad either.  I kid, I kid - the movie is terrific.",1330992000,4,230,4.871794871794871
2522302,5,B000ELJA60,"After viewing this movie, I was even sadder than when I read of Bianca's death.  Seeing the band from its origin in Butt Trumpet, to the new ""emergency"" lineup with Jennifer Finch, was too gripping to turn off or pause.  Little is said of the departure of Sharon and Judy right in the middle of the last tour, but I could feel the remorse in Sharon's  and Judy's comments after the accident.  Only they know how they feel, but I had empathy for both of them not seeing Bianca again. Buy this video if you are a Betty fan. It kicks ass. For those of us that never saw them live, it is the next best thing, and it is a great addition to their 2 albums. Love the intro to the band, it takes off just like the album ""Are You Man Enough"" and keeps on going to the end.",1312243200,,763,4.033112582781457
2522303,5,B000ELJA60,This is the best tribute I can think of to send off Bianca Butthole the lead vocalist. It is a shame to see what the record label did to the band. And how the band dealt with the actions of the label. Plus seeing what happened before Betty Blowtorch changed their name was interesting.,1305504000,,285,4.296296296296297
2522304,5,B000ELJA60,"Very watchable documentary about the band Betty Blowtorch. I don't think you need to be a fan to enjoy this film, but you just may be one after watching this. These ladies were fun, sexy as hell, and totally rocked.

I didn't hear their music until years after they disbanded, so it was very cool to see some good footage of them playing live. There is also some funny stuff with them on the road and in the studio (Vanilla Ice makes an appearance).

The documentary doesn't really get into the arguments or problems that they were having within the band, which leaves viewers wondering exactly what happened between some of the members. In light of Bianca's death, I don't blame them for wanting to leave out the petty BS and drama, but a little more information would have been good for the story.",1278892800,2,799,4.541666666666667
2522305,5,B000ELJA60,"A wonderful moment of pure rock and roll! These girls are so powerful,like Girlschool,the runaways or the donnas! Bianca we'll never forget you!",1194480000,5,144,5.304347826086956
2522306,5,B000ELJA60,"I was lucky enough to have seen them live when they were in NYC. Seems like ages ago! Or should that be ""a life ago""?

They knew how to rock and they did it hard. They blew me away as that was my introduction to them. fireworks and all.

It was tragic when I heard the news of the accident. It was not a good year for Rock n Roll.

Recommend this as: a way to hold on to a piece of what could of been. This is a tribute to that hard road traveled if your female, a musician, and on the road touring.

It's a fanstasy that bands get the fancy tour buses and private jets.(If they do have that, they will be broke in a few years causeit all comes off the top of any money actually made)",1178064000,2,684,3.8297872340425534
2522307,5,B000ELJA60,"This film is in a class all by itself. Women in rock are often unrecoginzed and unappreciated. This true story follows the lives of women who break the gender rules and give the men a run for their money. Strong, courageous, highly talented women who put together a one-of-a-kind sound storm the stage and the road with such intensity, you'll wish to God you had a chance to see them perform today. The mere existence of this footage is a gift. The way it's put together is an art. Whether you're a fan of women in rock or just a fan of great stories, I highly recommend this film.",1151798400,13,581,4.339449541284404
2522308,5,B000ELJA60,I'm a sucker for rocumentaries and this one takes the cake.  No flashy stadiums or tour buses here. These girls rock out across the country van style with Marshalls in tow.  All the best road dog pranks and madness you can imagine.  This film is both hilarious and heart wrenching at the same time.  It must have been fun...,1146873600,7,324,4.440677966101695
2522309,5,B000ELJA60,"Surprisingly heartfelt documentary for a flick about bad ass rocker chicks! Incredible insight into the music industry as well as the hardships of being in a band. Doesn't back off from showing the ugly side of the relationships, addictions, or tragedy. This is a must for anyone who is a music fan.",1146614400,9,299,4.769230769230769
2522310,5,B000ELJA60,"I 100% LOVED this film. The intensity of how well you get to know this band and this girl, really makes the tragic ending so powerful. Its a must see, and not only for music fans.",1146528000,6,179,4.0
2522311,5,B000ELJA60,"Saw this movie at the Hollywood Forever graveyard of all places. It was during an outdoor tribute screening. I was not aware of the band's music as I never heard their music before I had seen the movie, but a friend brought me and I must say that I was easily hooked. The songs are great and pretty catchy. The girls have a great attitude - and I loved their tattoos! It was sad watching the story unfold, I guess 'cause I felt like I just met them and didn't want to see her go. If you know the L.A. music scene at all you will recognize some of the people.  Duff from Guns n' Roses is in the film, too - he produced one of their records. Vanilla Ice killed me. Ice gets major props for his honesty --I won't give away spoilers, that would be cheating. All in all, the film is a great mix of high art and high drama, with a whole lotta rock and roll. I'm trying to think of movies to compare it to but can't right now - which is a good thing. It's an original and it's real, which is nice for a change..",1146441600,20,1004,3.9702970297029703
8110972,3,B000ELJA60,"Unsettling. Just finished watching it and I'm depressed. So much rage, pain, angst all rolled up in one band....Talented, yes. Difficult to watch for this extended period of time. Maybe watching it in pieces would be easier. Sad for Bianca, sad for the band. Sad for everyone. Just. Sad.",1526083200,,287,4.877551020408164
8110973,5,B000ELJA60,Love it!...,1519862400,,11,5.0
8110974,5,B000ELJA60,"While this may be a gritty and uncensored tale of a band of metal chicks, there's an underlying story of recovery, hope, f$!kn' craziness and unfortunately the loss of someone very special. Buy it, watch the extras, Bianca's eulogy will have you tearing up. Highly recommended.",1516579200,,277,5.043478260869565
8110975,5,B000ELJA60,"Can't believe that this group didn't rocket to the top of the heap! Hot chicks who crossed AC/DC with Motorhead! The ""mature"" story lines musta kept them off the radio. This record rocks! DJ, Bass guy, The Tombstone Hands.",1507420800,,222,4.717948717948718
8110976,5,B000ELJA60,"Sad story about a great band.  It's a shame that so many bands are plagued with incessant drama, and needless bickering.  Especially when life is so short, which is glaringly evident in Bianca's death.  I would go so far as to bet this band would have kept the raw, trashy Rock n Roll feeling in their music, had they went on.  So many bands lose their grit, but Betty Blowtorch was the real deal during their short time.",1505606400,,421,4.358974358974359
8110977,1,B000ELJA60,"I was really jazzed to watch this rock doc after watching the trailer. Well, the longer it went on, the less of the story I was getting. There are endless musical interludes and scenes of the girls hanging out and laughing. Actually following the journey of the band was taxing to say the least.

They definitely were a great band! However, I watch these things to find out the supposed riveting story inside. Not sit through long periods for another factoid about somone leaving and then suing. It's not exactly a flowing story when the whole thing is broken into confusing tidbits throughout the length of the film. Believe me, I was skipping ahead after a while.

By the time I got about halfway through, I realized I no longer cared to find out about the singers death -  I was way too bored already. What a frustrating and disappointing documentary. It's definitely for people who are ALREADY FANS of the band, NOT someone looking to find out what their journey was. If you are not already a BB fan, give this one a huge pass.",1504742400,,1031,4.532258064516129
8110978,5,B000ELJA60,"Certainly worth the watch if you're a fan of Betty Blowtorch, Butt Trumpet, or just women who rock hard and ride free.",1496880000,,118,4.409090909090909
8110979,5,B000ELJA60,"Wow!  Never paid much attention to these girls back in the late 90's and early 2000's, but was reintroduced via this documentary. Even if you're not a fan this is heart wrenching but also a great tribute to one of the best bands of the last 20 years.

RIP Bianca Halstead",1484006400,,271,4.294117647058823
8110980,4,B000ELJA60,"I've watched this documentary many times. One criticism that I have about it is the way it jumps around some. If you're not familiar with the story of Betty Blowtorch and Bianca Halstead, it can leave you a bit confused at times. It was filmed before digital cameras and some looks to be converted from consumer quality video cameras, so the image quality isn't up to par with newer films. The story isn't told with the kind of compelling depth of say ""The Punk Singer"" or ""Hit So Hard"", 2 newer documentaries focusing on similar musicians from around the same era. Betty Blowtorch never became a huge success ... not through lack of talent or hard work but through tragedy. This film tells that story. I happen to love their music and have tried to turn other friends on to it, so I admit I am biased toward the band from a musical standpoint, but the only reason I  wouldn't give this 5 stars are the reasons above. This is one of the truly great, albeit terrible and tragic stories of American Rock 'N Roll.",1461024000,,1010,4.45945945945946
8110981,1,B000ELJA60,A dreadful out of focus documentary about a really bad band.  The story line is confused and the filming is very low quality.  This is both hard to listen to and hard not to fast forward.  Waste of time.,1460419200,,203,4.153846153846154
