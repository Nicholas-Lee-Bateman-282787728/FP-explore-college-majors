7795766,5,150180541X,Hamilton's (2015): JOHN: The Gospel of Light and Life provides incredible insight into the purpose and meaning of the Gospel of John; especially comparing and contrasting the Gospel of John with the Synoptic Gospels. A great encouragement to those of us who ponder the Bible daily and are interested in exploring who Jesus Christ is in His humanity and in His deity. This book also challenges Christians to live in ways that please the Father just as His Son-Jesus Christ does.,1458345600,2,477,4.901234567901234
7795767,1,150180541X,"The DVD was disappointing as the content was directed to a small group discussion with canned questions.  Hamilton, looking at the script and speaking too fast, made no attempt to include the viewer.  His previous DVD's included videos of the sites and scenery that supplemented the study books. This DVD added nothing toward facilitating a group.  Unless I can preview upcoming DVD's, I will not purchase them.",1458259200,3,411,5.104477611940299

7795769,5,150180541X,A very well done overview of John's gospel. Adam Hamilton provides thoughtful material and opportunity to discuss it in a small group setting.,1457395200,,142,5.217391304347826
7795770,3,150180541X,"I have led studies of many of Adam Hamilton's works.  Each time the DVD proved to be a very valuable resource.  The DVD took us places and explained things that enriched the material in the book.  This time the DVD is of Adam Hamilton leading a study of the book.  The material presented is available in the book.  At the end of each presentation, when he asks for questions, it does not seem to be spontaneous, but some carefully planned out exercise.  While the book and the leader materials present a wonderful study for Lent (definitely five stars), I don't feel that the DVD adds anything.",1454025600,7,594,4.556603773584905
