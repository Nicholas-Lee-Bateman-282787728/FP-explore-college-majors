5549603,1,B00B1FXN2A,Quite possibly one of the worst films I've ever seen,1447286400,,52,4.3
5549604,1,B00B1FXN2A,"I wish I had read some of these reviews before I tried to watch this film. The write up for the film made it sound like it would be a gripping exploration of people and their problems on a New Years Eve. It had the potential to be a real work of art. Sadly, it didn't live up to its potential. It is incredibly slow moving and offers a script that is so difficult to follow. If you have the time and a deep reservoir of patience, are somewhat masochistic, then this could be a movie for you. I would rather have a nail hammered into my eyeball, but that is just me.",1421884800,4,565,4.008849557522124

5549610,1,B00B1FXN2A,Very stupid wish I could get a refund. If I had a chance to preview the movie before purchase it would have remained there,1379894400,,122,4.125
5549611,3,B00B1FXN2A,"While it may take a while to figure out the roles and dynamics of each character, none of that matters once Lavern Cox's character shows up with a bowl of punch. Sad, violent, and funny make for a movie that had me thinking about it for days after seeing it. A different movie worth seeing.",1371945600,4,290,4.290909090909091
5549612,3,B00B1FXN2A,"The description for this self indulgent little flik makes it sound pretty sexy - speaking, as it does, about ""blurring the line between art and pornography"" - BUT - there is nothing that I would call remotely 'pornographic' about its' content.

The premise evolves around a group of 3 people who are professionally related as 'documentary film makers' and their 'mates' who all get together for a New Years Eve 'party' where things go generally 'wrong' as personal relationship issues are revealed and 'filmed' by the obsessive 'director' of the filmic trio.  Tensions are created by acts of marital infidelity, incestuous revelations, and a tiny bit of kinky D/S play between a couple of the female characters.

I had to watch the movie twice to sort out who was who and what all the subtle interpersonal interactions were all about.  The sound quality was poor in many areas making it difficult to catch certain key lines of dialog that are crucial to understanding what is going on between the various characters.  The acting was generally passable but the characters themselves were somewhat unlikable and many of the situations presented were questionable in their plausibility as peoples lives spin out of control in an alcoholic daze and their angst is captured by the  obnoxiously intrusive lens of the documentarian.  Despite a fair amount of sexual 'tension' between all of the individuals there is virtually no sexual activity portrayed and no nudity.  Even after watching the film twice I was still perplexed as to where a weird red stain on several of the character's mouths came from and why no one bothered to wipe their face... one of many small annoyances that added up to a less than stellar viewing experience.

I could sorta see what the director was shooting for in this flik - trying to grapple with intense sexually driven emotional themes with an ensemble cast - but (for me) it felt pretty contrived and ultimately un-engaging.  More of a 'rental' than a 'keeper'.",1370649600,14,1989,4.92814371257485
