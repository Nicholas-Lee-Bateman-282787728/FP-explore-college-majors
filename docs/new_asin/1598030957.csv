7799893,5,1598030957,Very high quality lectures. I have listened to several Teaching Company courses and this is one of the best. If you are new to philosophy you will probably love this course. I listened to it while running on the trail and it made me run even longer than I normally do. Patrick Grim is a great speaker too. Overall I loved it. I wish there were other recordings of Patrick Grim lectures.,1325116800,4,386,4.375
7799894,4,1598030957,"This is an excellent production and good summary of concepts from Western philosophy. The use of many situations from Science Fiction or News Events keeps things light and meaningful. The speaker's style is easy to listen to and was done in 30-minute topics that make it easy to pick up at different times. I had the audio CD version and it made good listening on the daily comutes.

Course Lecture Titles: Questions of Value; Facts and Values; Lives to Envy, Lives to Admire; Foundations of Ethics; Theories of the Good; Foundations of Ethics; Theories of the Right; Thoughts on Religion and Values; Lifes Priorities; The Cash Value of a Life; How Do We Know Right from Wrong?; Cultures and Values; Questions of Relativism; Cultures and Values; Hopi, Navajo, and Ik; Evolution, Ethics, and Game Theory; The Objective Side of Value; Better Off Dead; A Picture of Justice; Lifes Horrors; A Genealogy of My Morals; Theories of Punishment; Choice and Chance; Free Will and Determinism; Images of Immortality; Ethical Knowledge, Rationality, and Rules Moralities in Conflict; and in Change Summing Up

I thought it did particularly good in finding examples that would connect with the listener, and make them feel that philosophical views are present in everyday life and a major influence to thoughts and world events. These included such as ""Cash Value of a Life"" influencing the design of a Pinto gas tank, or Immortality and Vampire stories by Ann Rice, or Teleporters and Immortality, or the movie ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence"". Generally excellent individually and outstanding as a whole. I thought it was weak only in the handling of religion, lack of Eastern Philosophy, and slightly weaker section on Justice (but maybe there just is no good or simple ""answer"" there.) The historical perspective was lacking mention of the philosophers of the Western Churches speaking to the same topics and their role in evolving philosophy. (i.e. Debates with Greek philosophers of Ante-Nicean Fathers circa 100-200 AD; Acquinas' Summary of Philosophy; noted figures Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Bacon, Kierkengaard, Wesley; and the ethical movements and values of Scholasticism, Protestants, and Puritans.) It also lacked effort to a modern perspective for religion and possible role in spiritual help even in a post-superstitious modern age, which might have been made similar or part of the treatment given Evolution and Game Theory as concepts with different methods but notably producing similar results to philosophical methods on some topics. Finally, it was by design lacking examination of Eastern Philosophy (e.g. Spiritual History of India Prabhaumnanda) although some nods were given in comments during the sections (e.g. to Confucianism). Again, overall an excellent production and generally a good presentation of Western Philosophy",1222992000,6,2840,5.337053571428571
