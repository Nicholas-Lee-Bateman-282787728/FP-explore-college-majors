They were also out of sync with the picture when I first started watching it, which wasn't a deal breaker since my Slovene is passable and actors' diction was great, a pleasant surprise. (Spoilers below.  I total give away the crazy ending - pun intended.)

Overall, I found it a disturbing film.  Though the film follows three college girls, it is really about their relationships with men, so it feels narrow in scope.  The male characters were clueless or mysogonistic.  If they were not potential murders or rapists then they were only interested in machismo or sex.  A horrible representation of men, though I could certainly give supporting examples, especially after living in Maribor.  This film is not a fair representation of all Slovene men.

There are three representations with the girls: tradition (heterosexual), non-traditional (bi-curious) and anti-traditional (homosexual).  The male representation of tradition (& family) is presented as a possible serial killer and rapist, but then at the end of the film you discover he was only a figment of Simona's (hetero) imagination the entire film.  She's paranoid of being raped, tells stories about having an affair with a married man and then having an abortion when she's 16 because she get's pregnant by him.  Point being the traditional girl has NO concept of reality and is presented as the insane person in the film.  And since when aren't traditional girls virgins?  Honestly, there is no true representation of tradition in this film, even though it seems to be the pet topic.

At one pointing in the film the lesbian says if she were a man she'd have as much sex as possible, because you should not confuse love with sex.  She has a one night fling with her bi-curious childhood friend and is then crushed when the bi-curious friend is still checking out her exboyfriend. This leaves the lesbian crying in the bathroom, crushed, even after her don't confuse love with sex speech.  She then goes out and dances with abandon by herself, framed at the back of the shot in the last scene.

Last scene has the bi-curious girl in the foreground facing the camera.  She seems okayish, but is the only one who does.  The hetero girl is in an entirely different scene paranoidly thinking that a man is waiting to grope her.  The point being?  I didn't relate to anybody in this film.  Every character was tragic and there was seriously nothing redemptive or suggestive in how things could be better or how the characters could stop being self-centered and imbalanced.  It might as well be Russian for the depressing tone: This is how things are and they suck and always will.

A pet peeve for me is movies that talk about women being sexual victims, or being reduced to sex, and yet every five minutes the girls are ripping their shirts off or skinny dipping.  This movie is SO critical of men, but it sure did a bang up job of getting those actresses naked bodies on the screen.  So what makes the film maker any betterthanthe men depicted?  That being said, kudos that the rape was handled metaphorically.  I'm serious.  I was all ready to vomit, and then they handled it in metaphor.  Still, the meaning of her in a tub with a bunch of dead fish - horrible!  Metaphor was bad too.  Also, kudos that the love scene was not total porn.  Then again, I skipped ahead a few seconds in a couple of places, so don't take my word for it.

I honestly don't know why I forced myself to finish this movie.  Watch something about real people - check out Tito y Ya (My Comrad Tito - I think that's the working title in English.  Pria is another good one in being suggestive - the characters find meaning.  What Lina Saw is another good one, thought it's Croatian and I'm pretty sure I remembered the name wrong.  At any rate, Guardians was not awful from a technical perspective, and fortunately, it is not representative of all Slovene film available internationally.  Really, it's slim pickings in the US, but there is more.",1450483200,,4150,4.686030428769018

8102494,1,B000DN5VX0,"Eastern European motion picture facilities and film locations are attracting the world's film makers but their own film making capabilities are at a rudimentary level. ""Guardians of the Frontier"" is a case in point. Script, direction, acting, cinematography - all aspects of the film maker's craft are a full notch below where they should be for an internationally released project. I was attracted to the idea of this film. The potential for it to be an interesting, suspenseful movie was all in place but that potential was unrealized. Knowing this project had not been well received by the NF reviewers, I chose to take a chance. Considering that I'm usually not in step with the mainstream, I figured I might find something to like in spite of the negative reviews. In this case I was wrong. If you took the script for the film ""Deliverance,"" gave it to a teenage wannabe movie maker with instructions to rewrite the story and make a movie with a camcorder, ""Guardians of the Frontier"" is not much better that what you would get. Pay attention to the reviews. This is not a film worth a time investment",1324339200,2,1106,4.7357512953367875
8102495,3,B000DN5VX0,"""Guardian of the Frontier"" is director Maja Weiss's debut film, and if it's anything to judge by, her future films are going to be well worth watching.  ""Guardian"" has a lot of weaknesses--it's a bit overlong, it has so many subplots going on that the film seems patchworked at times, the editing is rough and abrupt in a few places, and segments of the fantasy sequence towards film's end are unintentionally funny (the fish/phallus scene in particular).  But for all that, the film has several commendable features.

The acting is really quite good.  The three young women leads--Iva Krajine (Simona), Tanja Potocnik (Alja), and Pia Zemjic (Zana) created complicated and engaging characters.  Zana is the bohemian lesbian who feels stifled by her culture; Alja, the best friend for whom Zana has a heavy crush, is stifled in her relationship with an utterly conventional boyfriend; Simona, who has a secret and unhappy past, feels threatened by the quick change that's swept over much of Slovenia since the Balkan War.

The shifting of frontiers--between cultural and geographical points, feminism and patriarchy, conventional and unconventional intimacy, the old and the new, the urban and the rural, bohemia and bourgois--is the major theme of this allegorical film, symbolized throughout by the canoe journey the three women take down the Kolpa, the river that serves as an actual geographical frontier between Slovenia and Croatia.  The message seems to be that frontiers can make us feel secure, but they can also encourage fear and hatred of the other, the person (or culture or way of loving:  fill in the blank) on the other side of the frontier.  As Simona discovers, even those on the ""right"" side of the frontier can be harmed rather than protected by it.  Security isn't always what one needs.

A film that's pleasant to watch, ""Guardian"" stimulates thinking about one's own notions of frontier.  It's also very cool to see a Slovenian film, especially one directed by a woman.

8102496,4,B000DN5VX0,"It's summer break in Slovenia, and three college students decide to get away from it all on a canoe trip down the Kolpa River, which separates Slovenia from Croatia. Alja (Tanja Potocnik), Simona (Iva Krajnc) and Zana (Pia Zemljic) are all happy to just float away and sunbathe topless.

It turns out to be a trip about crossing many different borders. Alja deals with pressures to be ""normal"" by marrying and having children. The naive Simona seems obsessed with finding a fairytale man, but is confronted by men in a different way when they visit a house on the Croatian side of the river. Their hosts are a gay couple, and she disapproves. She's also horrified when she sees Zana and Alja kissing. Zana is looking for love and pursues Alja throughout the trip.

Issues of nationality, tradition, urban versus rural ""family"" values, as well as sexism and homophobia are confronted as they are caught crossing the border illegally and then find themselves in a village of people much more aggressively traditional than their young, urban selves. When they are pursued by would be rapists, everything turns even darker.

Simona escapes into a fantasy world as she rejects her friends' more modern values. Zana and Alja finally make love, but it's unclear if Alja is interested in the relationship Zana craves.

This is the first Slovenian feature film directed by a woman (Maja Weiss). I have a feeling that many of the cultural references were lost on me, as the fantasy sequences were confusing. The political and social issues are quite fascinating though.",1141776000,11,1559,4.916349809885932
