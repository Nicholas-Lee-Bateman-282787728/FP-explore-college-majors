Considering the whirlwind tour they were on they did manage to capture quite a lot of the local flavour on film. There was perhaps a bit too much reference of their surprise to find that Russia had all the usual trappings of a modern society and it wasn't the Iron Curtain veiled in secrecy that was imagined. Yes, it's just a regular country after all. Not a bad flick but a bit dated now.",1262822400,,502,4.13265306122449
8610927,5,B0028K3HGO,"I am definitely a huge fan of Barry and Corinne's DVD's. After seeing China Part-1, I couldn't wait to see Part-2, and this endearing and adventuresome couple did not let me down! As with all their DVD productions I learned so many tips and everything I need to know to ensure that I visit and see the best places that highlight the country's charm and uniqueness. Thanks again Barry and Corinne for sharing your travel experiences so that the rest of the world can be inspired and well informed.",1250294400,,496,4.584269662921348
