2887673,4,B000SM6FJK,"I think its a shame how Amazon has really gotten confused over these new Firm DVDs. First, this is not the ""old"" Time Crunch with Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun. This is a ""new"" Time Crunch with Rebekah Sturkie and all the ""youngin"" Firm ladies. (Though Allie and Sue Mi have been there since the mid-90's and are still in the set).

I bought this from the Firm site as a 5-DVD package (which includes others listed to be released in December on Amazon). The DVD is interesting. Quite different from the ""old"" ones, though. No step or fanny lifter involved. Just good ol' cardio and weights!

Also of note, Amazon has a few titles listed under ""The Firm"" which are Gaiam releases, not ""The Firm"" brand. I am sure people who pre-ordered these titles will be surprised when they get them and they see they're not ""The Firm"". Oh well.",1189296000,15,831,4.496688741721854
2887674,4,B000SM6FJK,"I have been trying to find a way/person to get all my old Firm VHS tapes on DVD!!  I love these old tapes - as someone else on another review said: they seem much more intense, even with the older look and approach.  The moves are still not all that different from the ""new Firm"" moves.  This ""express"" was express only by the other tapes' standards at about 60 minutes a piece...express is still 45 here, and at least 35 of it was intense.  I find the classic Firm harder to get all the way through without gasping for air than some of the newer ones.",1187913600,,552,4.179245283018868
2887675,5,B000SM6FJK,this is a great workout I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get into shape and be healthy,1359590400,,104,4.0
2887676,5,B000SM6FJK,"I first found this video several years ago at a store.  I love The Firm's 25 minute workouts.  I have Rheumatoid disease, and will do anything to keep my body going.  This video does exactly that.  I purchased a second one, as I have the rest of my Firm videos.  I use the older ones for when I travel.  I never leave home without my Portable DVD player, weights and video.  Thank you 'The Firm'.",1341273600,,396,4.2
2887677,4,B000SM6FJK,"I love Rebekah (b/c I'm OCD about ""making sides even""), so I fell in love w/ her right away. She definitely gets you moving and your heart rate up (445 calories in 45 minutes). I actually thought I would have burned more, so was slightly disappointed to find out I didn't.",1327190400,2,272,4.352941176470588
2887678,3,B000SM6FJK,"I've purchased other videos from the firm that are more strenuous workouts with less fancy moves to catch on to, like ""Get Chiseled"" and ""Calorie Explosion"". This was a bit disappointing in that respect, too many moves too fast to catch on to right away (sure, you'll get them after 20 times, but in the meantime, you get frustrated and it doesn't even feel like much of a workout), and not as strenuous as I'd prefer. Good workout, just not exactly what I was looking for. Give me straight-up, challenging to the muscles, power moves any day.",1322006400,,543,4.608247422680412
2887679,3,B000SM6FJK,"This video is alright, definitely not my favorite but since I can never find good workouts between 45-50 minutes I keep doing it.  I've had it for about two years and it's a solid workout.  I find all of the cardio sections really annoying, but like the weights sections better.  Rebekah is not the best cuer: she's says that we're going to alternate legs and then doesn't, there's a cardio section that I always mess up on b/c the action is with the left leg, but she calls it right instead.  So just weird little things like that.  Also the cardio isn't particularly challenging. I didn't think I would ever miss step but I find the older Firm workouts that used a step to be more challenging (even though they would change the step like every year!) As always with the Firm I like using upper and lower body simultaneously, and with heavy enough weights, these sections are totally worthwhile.

This DVD is good for a day when you're not quite up to a killer workout.",1308960000,2,970,4.482954545454546
2887680,4,B000SM6FJK,"I have been doing the FIRM for several years and usually go for the one hour DVDs.  However, I needed something I could do at lunch since my schedule has changed a bit.  The good news is my offce has a space with workout equipment and a TV & DVD player so I thought I would take advantage at lunch.  However, I needed something shorter than 1 hour.  This work  out is an all over body toner with aerobics and in 45 minutes you have received the full benefit of a one hour work out.  It is amazing how the time flies.  It is fun, versatile and no muscle is left out of this compact, efficient workout.",1300147200,,600,4.076923076923077
2887681,5,B000SM6FJK,"This is a great video that incorporates aerobics and weights. Yes, the moves are a little hard to understand the first go round, but with practice you learn them and her pattern. Definitely a good sweat!",1297123200,,203,4.666666666666667
2887682,2,B000SM6FJK,"Staring at the TV scratching your head while the instructor calls out a series of moves at breakneck speed with no breakdown beforehand is just not an effective workout.  I have four dance workout dvds, all of which are much easier to follow than this thing.  Maybe after 20 or 30 times watching it I might get the steps down.  But then again, why would I want to bother?  Stepford wives have more personality than the instructor and demonstrators on this video.  This is my first Firm video, so maybe the blandness is a trait of the brand?  Hope not.  I just found Rebekah really irritating (sorry) and got sick of hearing her say the same things over and over.  The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is that the weight intervals were not as bad as the cardio, but I'd still take any of my other dvds ahead of this one.",1279756800,,835,4.3076923076923075
2887683,4,B000SM6FJK,"I am a new firm fan, having found their dvds within the last 6 months and overall, they are my favorite work outs to do.  This is my favorite dvd by Rebekah.  I agree with the other reviewer that sometimes it is a little hard to follow - particularly the 2nd cardio routine - but I have done it two times now and it was much easier the 2nd time.  I took dancing for years as a kid and pick up choreography pretty quickly - if I mess up, I am still burning calories and who will know?  What I like is that she does different exercises in different combinations, particularly for the lower body and thighs.  When you do the ham and abduct - it is really tough but in a good way.  She also has you do bridges with one leg lifted - I have never seen that and it works!  If you can be a little patient with learning the steps, I think you will really like it.",1275436800,,854,3.9590643274853803
2887684,3,B000SM6FJK,"I ordered this video because I loved Get Chisel'd with Rebekah. But I was disappointed... I'm not saying is bad workout, but, It's just ok. The cardio segments are way to hard to keep up with! All I did was follow the first moves and kept doing those ones because it gets very difficult follow every single one of them. Even Rebekah's voice sounds desperate at one point she says: ONE SINGLE, ONE DOUBLE!! And you can tell by her voice it was hard for her to do.

This workout is just not for me, but if you like dancy workouts, you may want to give it a try. I plan on putting this DVD on the shelf... and if I do it once or twice, I'll just make my own cardio routine during the cardio segments.",1275177600,,697,4.087591240875913
2887685,5,B000SM6FJK,"This video can be a tad challenging, not in terms of over-exertion, but in terms of quick changes, but the results are worth it.  I have been doing this for around four mnths now, and it was a gift from my sister at Christmas, and I am now more toned at 36 then I was at 26.  It is not too high impact, but delivers a massive sweat.  You don't need tons of equipment and space, either.  I strongly recommend you use this to get in shape for the summer!",1271116800,3,452,3.988888888888889
2887686,3,B000SM6FJK,"I have used the Firm workouts for over 15 years now.  I was really excited to try this DVD as a new option for a good workout.  The basics are the same in regard to intervals of weight lifting and cardio.  However, Rebekah's calls are rather late and give little instruction.  I constantly found myself frustrated and trying to figure out where she was in the combos.  I'm sure in time I will have the moves memorized, but in general this workout is lacking good instruction.  I have come to expect more of the Firm, and this is not one of my favorites.",1269302400,,553,4.320388349514563
2887687,4,B000SM6FJK,"As a fit 20-something, I find this DVD provides a very challenging workout with great music and enjoyable instruction by likeable leader Rebekah Sturkie.  Four short cardio segments really get me moving and sweating, interspersed with three short weight-training segments that help me catch my breath a little, though they definitely leave me burning the next day. I really like that there's a 25-minute express workout, though it's just the regular warm-up cardio followed by two of the weight segments then the abs/cool-down--I would appreciate more cardio here (but you can get the same effect by fast-forwarding the regular workout to make your own).

I think this is a good choice for intermediate or advanced users, but not beginners, although one of the women does simplified lower-impact beginner moves throughout.  I found the choreography and pace of the cardio to be extremely challenging the first couple times I followed the workout, and had a lot of difficulty keeping up initially.  It was much better once I was familiar with the moves and order, but I still often need to slow down and watch my form.  The moves are quick and it would be easy to injure myself if I let myself get tired and sloppy just trying to keep up.  Definitely take it easy and light the first handful of times you do this.

The abs segment on the floor is very effective, and thankfully short.  I could barely do it the first few times, but after awhile found it very refreshing, and was astonished over a few weeks to see my abs and sides get hard as a rock!!  The segment is intense but brief, and I always feel like I've earned the cool-down right after.

After doing the regular or express workout only 2-3 times a week for two months, I am surprised at my own strength and energy, and pleased with the sexy toned body I've earned!  This DVD will get you in great shape if you stick with it--just be careful to watch your form and adjust the intensity to your needs.",1263772800,3,1960,4.635838150289017
2887688,3,B000SM6FJK,"Like most of the other Firm workouts, this one is so fast paced that it is very challenging to maintain good form. The first ten minutes do provide a good warm-up and some fun introductory steps. As the video progresses, however, what began as a pleasant challenge becomes increasingly frustrating and no longer enjoyable. There is an increasing number of single moves that alternate from side to side quickly, and the cuing is poor.

I gave this one 3 stars because I think that the risk of injury is even higher here than it is in some of the other fast-paced Firm workouts. Lunges are particulary risky moves even under the best of circumstances; many people injure their knees while lunging. This DVD rushes you through both forward lunges and side to side lunges, both of which should be done carefully and with perfect form in order to avoid injury.

Even on my best days, I don't make it through this workout unless I modify it quite a bit during the second half. I do it at a slower pace, or repeat some moves more while eliminating others altogether. Given that there are so many other good workouts available, however, I would recommend purchasing a different DVD, rather than struggling through this one. The Firm Cardio Sculpt Fusion Workout is far superior, as is Cardio Core Fusion.",1263686400,,1296,4.704845814977974
2887689,5,B000SM6FJK,"I have recently purchased 95% of the TransFirmation DVDs, aka ""Firm Pinks"" and I have to say these are some of the best DVDs on the market. I have a Fitness DVD collection of over 500 and I have finally gotten to the point were I have found something that is effective, fun, offers minimal equipment, and gets you in/out in shorter time compared to other systems that offer both cardio and strength in 1 workout.

Total Body Time Crunch is approx 45 Minutes in length, about 47 due to the extend stretching. You have 3 cycles of both cardio and strength, starting with cardio/warmup and ending with strength on the floor. According to Fitness DVD websites, this workout is rated anywhere from Intermediate/Advanced to straight Advanced. I will say that this feels more along the combination of Intermediate/Advanced. It recommends starting out 3, 5, & 8 lbs dumbbells, and beginners, no weights. I have been lifting weights for sometime and I am familar with the Firm so I decided to up my selection to 4s (bad shoulder), 8s and 10s. 8s or my ""Medium Weight-according to Firm Instruction"" were used most often. Now for people who feel this isn't advanced enough due to the strength element alone, you NEED to use heavier weights for MAXIMUM results!! I have just started back to exercise after almost 7 months off and had been using 3s, 5s, & 8s like in the DVD, but wasn't finding the challenge for most muscle groups. Upping the weights even just slightly made all the difference in the World! I am hoping to up the weight selection again in another 2-3 weeks. For those concerned with the ""Bulk"" myth, I found out today directly from Firm Master Instructor herself (answered an email), that she, Allison, uses 8s and 10s as her low weight for most Firm Workouts and up to 20-25 lbs for larger groups like legs, back, and chest!!! If you see Allison in these DVDs, she's firm and tight, not bulky! I can't even lift that doing the Cardio-Weight workouts; that's incredible!

As far as the Cardio goes in this one, it will take 2-3 run thrus to get it completely. It's not dancy IMO, I hate Dance DVDs, but it's not basic either. If you've done the Fanny Lifter DVDs, which is my Firm Background, it's more complex than that, but not by leaps and bounds. It't taught in add-on style so a new move is added about every minute, min/half during the cardio cycles, practiced a few times and the cycle is over. It varies anywhere from power squats to side steps, side steps with leg lifts or knee lifts, kickboxing-lite, 4 limb, ect.

If you are a true advanced exerciser doing Cathe Friedrich or Amy Bento on a regular basis, this will be rated intermediate for you. If however you are a Firmy, Inter/Advanced, and Non-Firmie, Non-Strength person, Advanced. I actually got this and another ""solid-Intermediate"" DVD mixed up this morning when working out; I thought I was doing the less-intense of the two. Turns out I did the more advanced DVD and I loved every minute of it. With the heavier weights my muscles felt it like they haven't in prior Firm Pink workouts, my fault not theirs, and I am excited to try more and do this one more often. This is a great buy! While the reps are not long or muscles groups repeated except for the leg work (different types of exercises for the same muscle group) and Chest, I felt I got a perfect weight workout. I used heavy enough weight that by the time we were doing the last 2 reps, my arms were going to fall off in revolt. Now that's how you know you've picked the right weight! Not so heavy you will hurt yourself, but heavy enough you feel like you can't do another rep when the set is finished.

Again, 3 cycles of cardio and strength, each cycle lasting about 5 minutes each. This DVD offers a 25 Minute Express Option, wonderful I am sure, so 2 workouts on 1 DVD. Rebekah is an excellent lead, perhaps my favorite now, and her cueing is spot on! The music is typical Firm style, but I actually liked it in this workout. No complaints! The Chest Fly/Press and Bridge Combo along with the Tricep/Ab combo (both floor exercises) are quite impressive! Get this workout!

FYI: You can view a DVD clip at [...]. Clips range from 60 seconds to approx 3 minutes. This is again from the TransFirmation/Firm Pink Collection, not the Firm Classic Collection (mansion-style).",1255046400,6,4311,4.5717981888745145
2887690,5,B000SM6FJK,"I bought this DVD from reading another's review of it. I have been a faithful follower of Gilad and use every one of his DVD's & VHS tapes. I have sweated and grunted through the older Firm tapes and DVD's. While I was working out with this dvd, I felt for the first time that I really ENJOYED sweating it out due to Ms. Sturkie's  presentation and likeability. The pace gets fast but it's not complex to the point that you wanna just quit. I also loved the Spainish guitars used in some of the segments to further push you to completion. I highly recommend this DVD.",1254009600,,567,4.299065420560748
2887691,3,B000SM6FJK,This video takes time and patience to learn and execute the routines properly. I haven't done it but twice but it's so fast paced with so many different moves to learn it's a little disappointing. Hopefully in time I can follow along and not be lost. I wouldn't have purchased if I knew all this before hand but you really do get a total body workout.,1251936000,,351,4.333333333333333
2887692,3,B000SM6FJK,"I have about 10 Firm DVDs and I hardly ever use this one, because, as noted by a few other people, it is hard to learn and follow. I am familiar with the terminology and basic moves used by the Firm and usually when I get a new workout, it takes a few times through for me to get the routine, so I tried it several times. Each time I felt really frustrated by the cueing and how fast the moves were added and changed and how few repetitions were done before the move was changed. If you can figure it out and keep up, it's a decent workout, but the others that are less frustrating are the ones I'm motivated to pull out.",1246492800,,621,4.016129032258065
2887693,5,B000SM6FJK,"I love this workout!  Rebekah Sturkie has a positive, gentle and encouraging spirit, which I love and the training routine is amazingly effective.  My clothes began fitting looser and my husband commented that I looked leaner after only the SECOND workout!  I am now a FIRM believer!",1244851200,,283,4.9787234042553195
2887694,2,B000SM6FJK,"I bought this video based on the many positive reviews.  It's not bad... IF you have a LOT of extra time to learn the moves.  Generally I can keep up with changes... but not so many, so quickly.  I like more of a 'lets get down to business' kind of workout.  In the time it takes to learn the moves and her timing I could have had a few good workouts.  If you want to just get to work, and not have a bunch of fru-fru moves to learn before hand, this isn't a dvd for you.  If you like lots of changes, and can keep up, go ahead.  I'm sure once you get the hang of it, it's probably pretty good.",1242432000,,594,3.819672131147541
2887695,4,B000SM6FJK,"This is a good workout with a lot of strength, mixed with cardio.  I think the strength moves are challenging and the cardio moves are fun.  There is a section called Learn the Moves that shows the strength moves and how to do them in proper form.  I thought that was helpful.  The cardio moves are different and challenging at first but they are fun also.  I think the cueing is good although it took me a couple of times through to get the foot work down.",1241308800,,457,4.206896551724138
2887696,2,B000SM6FJK,"I'd used videos from The Firm before and read good reviews about this particular one, so was excited when it arrived in the mail. Maybe the trick is to use it many times, but my first run through was a real disappointment. The choreography is so complex that I spent half the time exasperated, trying to figure out what the instructor was doing. Funny thing was, even she and her ""co-teachers"" seemed lost or confused at points. If I had a few workout sessions (or other time in my life) to spend trying to get the choreography down, this might turn out to be a good video. But I don't. So I think it will go in the ""giveaway"" bag.",1237939200,,631,4.266666666666667
2887697,2,B000SM6FJK,"I'm at what one would consider as an advanced beginner/intermediate fitness level. I'm also pretty coordinated and usually don't have a problem following along with workout videos. About half the time I don't even bother listening to instruction the first time through. This time though I watched the video and the extra section on the moves first through and listened to audio. It didn't help. Her cuing is often off and she doesn't do enough reps of the moves for your body to get used to the motion. Consequently, I couldn't do most of the moves correctly.

I bought this because I have a limited amount of time each day to work out, but I wanted to work up from my 20 -30 minute high intesity workoutslike Jillian Michaels ""Shred"" to a 45 minute high intensity workout. This barely got my heart rate up, though to be fair, it's because I couldn't do half of the moves.

Not everyone wants or expects to be able to get a good workout from a video from the first time they use it, but I do. This doesn't deliver, and I expect that even when done correctly, this cardio won't get my heart rate up as much as I would like.",1235779200,,1122,4.389423076923077
2887698,4,B000SM6FJK,"The Firm's TBTC is a fun and very effective workout that alternates cardio and fast-paced sculpting  with  weights.  As with most of The Firms' recent workouts, I LOVE this one! Here's why: From beginning to end, the program is fast-paced, challenging, rewarding (i.e. results!) and FUN!
TBTC begins with a brisk 5-min. warm-up that does a decent job of both warming up your muscles and stretching you out (I especially like that very first move, the cross punch...I love feeling that in my waist!)
The program then alternates a sculpting segment followed by a cardio segment. It repeats this a total of 3 times.  The cardio is fun and will get you SWEATING!  It is not dance-y at all, but neither is it bootcamp-like in its intensity (no tire drills, jump-rope or any of the dreaded burpees here).  It is more on the higher impact side, however. The 1st cardio segment (probably my favorite) consists of one-legged hops from side to side, one-sided jacks, and has a very fun hamstring curl variation that I can't really describe, you kinda just have to see it.  I LOVE that one! The 2nd cardio segment is probably the most intense, beginning with this ""Superman-like"" move where you jump off the ground and then lunge back with one fist out in front of you...Between that move and the plyo jumps, you will be panting by the time you get to the end! The third and final cardio segment is probably no more intense than the 1st, but it feels a lot harder b/c you're already fatigued! It consists of a plyo move called ""squat switch"", some jumping lunges and a little bit of kickboxing moves towards the end.
The sculpting, though definitely a rest from the cardio, is no piece of cake either! Again, there are 3 segments, interspersed among the cardio, and most of them are in The Firm's signature 4-limb style: i.e. lower body doing some sort of squat/lunge combo and upper body wielding weights. Very effective and a lil bit challenging. And fun!
Following the last cardio, you move to the floor for some brief upper body and ab work.  I found the ab work okay, definitely not the best, but certainly better than nothing. After all, you can always find a 10 min. add-on (Star Trainer's Ab Blast and 10 Minute Solutions Blast Off the Belly Fat are both awesome...).
And then there's the final stretch. It's awesome! It's not too hurried, like in many programs. It's pretty thorough and set to this very relaxing Spanish guitar-sounding track.
And speaking of: I really like the music in this one. Upbeat and pop-sounding as opposed to the generic techno beat that is in many workout DVDs. As a matter of fact, I can't help but shake my butt a lil bit in that first sculpting segment when the beat kicks in!
The instructor, Rebekah, is great. Inspiring, energetic and knowledgeable.
Also, this particular DVD (some of The Firm's DVDs have this, most don't) has a bonus tutorial which explains correct form on many of their squats, weight lifts, lunges, etc. so that you won't hurt yourself and will get the most out of your workout. Excellent for those new to exercise. (There also are beginner modifications throughout the program.)
All in all, I think this a great fitness DVD and packs a lot of good stuff in 45 minutes! Highly recommended!

2887699,1,B000SM6FJK,"This DVD is so complicated and the cueing is off and instructor is relentless.  The instructor doesn't take a breath and drived me crazy.  I am fit and in my early 20s.  I have been a gymnast (and gymnastics coach), dancer, tennis player, and cheerleader and I couldn't follow this women.  My mom bought the DVD and got frustrated with it and passed it on to me.  I stuck with it once and when it got too akward I would just add a jog or run.  I thought the moves were too forced and didn't give as good of burn and intensity as my other workout DVDs.  She was very into adding on and changing it up and never stuck with one move for very long. I would recommend the Women's Health: The Wedding Workout and The Biggest Loser Workout: Cardio Max.  Those both include weights in the work out and are much more customizable to your needs and provided me with a better and more enjoyable workout.",1235347200,,892,4.267857142857143

I love almost all of the firm workout DVD's. They make you sweat and really work your muscles. The one flaw in almost all of them is the cueing can be a little off - they say left leg, when they should say right (because they are attempting to get you to mirror their moves). But this hasn't stopped me much from catching on. Allie del Rio and Allison are pretty good with cues... Overall, this is a good workout.",1233619200,,564,4.044642857142857

I found the moves to be unnecessarily complicated & difficult to pick up.  The instructor was off cue & difficult to follow.  Lousy camera angles & cheap in overall production.  The background instructors seem as if they were doing the DVD for the first time.  The master instructor, Rebekah Sturkie  didn't stop talking for even a second. I was really hoping to love this DVD.

2887704,3,B000SM6FJK,Loved the weight section but found the cardio steps too complex. They should put fewer steps and less complex routines in this cardio section so that everyone can get it right! Tried it several times but found it very difficult to follow the cardio routines minimizing the effect. Very frustrating to follow the 3 cardio sections. Even the warmup is too fast and complex.,1231718400,,371,4.8125

I own about 200 exercise DVDs and I'm definitely not a fan of The Firm (is there anything more cheesy?), but there are a few exceptions and this is one of them. I thought the instructor was good and friendly, cueing right on and much less robot-like than most other Firm instructors.

The DVD features master instuctor Rebekah Sturkie and this Lady Rocks . I lost one pound in one week and please remember to follow a healthy diet this is a plus, Enjoy this workout as well as others by the firm.

2887708,3,B000SM6FJK,"The moves on this video are very ""dancy"" and a little complicated.  I have done this tape 4 times already, and I still mess up the moves. I guess the moves can be done, though, with a little practice, because there is a tutorial on the DVD.  But who has time for that?  I thought we were trying to ""Crunch Time""?? The instructor tries to kill not two, but three birds with one stone alot of times.  For example, you do a lateral row, squat and hip abduction with one move.  It sounds like a great concept, but just leads to improper form.  Rebekah is a happy instructor, but her cuing is poor.  At one point in the video, she's telling you to move your left leg, but she's moving her left leg, too - and fitness video instructors are supposed to cue everything ""opposite"" so that the viewer can follow along.  So she messed me up.  The video didn't give me a good strength workout.  Cardio was decent, but the sequences were quick and complicated.",1230422400,2,947,4.329545454545454
2887709,1,B000SM6FJK,"I got this as a Christmas present. I have been through many workout dvds and this is the worst. The workout was led by a poor instructor. No warm up session provided. Also basic steps of the workout routine were not properly showed. It will not work for beginner. The instructor assumed that audience knows her routine, so she just kept on changing move. It is hard to follow her moves and very frustrating. I would not recommend this workout to anyone.",1223769600,,453,4.536585365853658
2887710,5,B000SM6FJK,"This exercise video is great. I like it because:
1. The moves are fun but challenging,
2. It is cardio plus scuplting.  I don't like straight cardio so this is great for me.  That keeps the workout interesting and the intensity up.
3. I get to make the most of my time working out since lots of the sculpting moves are two or three exercises in one.
4. All I need are two sets of dumbbells (doesn't matter if you don't have the new firm hand weights).  Even though I have the Firm Bodysculpting System II, sometimes just moving the steps around can be too much of a hassle.
5. I can do the whole workout low impact if I want to.

All in all I think it is excellent workout, Rebekah is a great lead and there is an express option for when I don't have lots of time.

2887711,4,B000SM6FJK,"This is a very good workout for most intermediate and advanced levels.  There's a lot of variety within the routines and the instructor is consistently adding in new moves as the cardio sections progress.  The Firm has definitely come a long way since its first workout videos released in the late 80's.
  The routines here are effective, challenging and varied. However, I would not recommend this workout to someone who is still a beginner.  I do wish there was better cuing and instruction in some of the sections. Occasionally the instructor does seem to run ahead without always verbally giving the viewer directions.  Although after doing this workout several times, most viewers will probably start remembering the routine a bit more. If you're looking to add a new challenging and interesting workout dvd to your collection, I recommend giving this a try.",1221264000,,863,5.042253521126761

The best part of the workout is the midsection. Nothing else has worked my abs like that, the rope being the most clever. The only true weakpoint I noticed was the stretching. I always feel the need to do more stretching afterwords, and I advise others to do this also, add a cobra stretch, quad stretch and sit-and-reach type stretches just to make sure.",1217894400,,500,4.617977528089888

Her cuing leaves much to be desired. Do not expect to get this workout down in the first few sessions - leave plenty of learning time because some of the moves aren't natural, the changes are abrupt, and often the cuing is late or nonexistant. Also, the music changes right in the middle of the workout.
I like the variety of exercises and feel that I get a total body workout. I like the express version of the workout, except that it does not have any cardio segments.

Would be a great workout with smoother transitions, much better cuing, and music that changes when the workout changes. I am used to better quality from The Firm.",1214784000,,801,4.524137931034483

It did take about a week to get the routine down. I still have trouble with some of the lower body/upper body coordination. All in all, I enjoy it.

Worse, on some of the tricky moves, the camera leaves the leader, which makes it even harder to pick up. I like the toning segments. This was Ok, but not great. My existing Firm CDs won't lost their place in rotation due to this one.",1212019200,,408,4.243589743589744

I really like this work-out. It is great in a Time Crunch offering a good variety of everything. Rebekah does a good job with cueing and the moves aren't difficult. As with most of the Firm workouts, there are basic moves and once you get them down, you can 'get' any of them.

Although I also have the TransFIRMer, the Fanny Lifter and Firm Box, I really like the new ones that don't require climbing on a step--altough I take those out regularly as well. I'd recommend this one, although if you are newer it might be a bit difficult, be sure to follow the modified moves, and stick with it!",1210032000,,720,4.286764705882353

It is actually a fun workout especially for dance challenged people like me who like a straight up work out no nonsense!! my only beef is I wish there was more abs!

2887721,5,B000SM6FJK,"I like this DVD very much. Sure, it took several tries to get it all down pat, but at the end of the day after a full day of work I go home and put the 20 min. quick version on. I  wait till the week-end to do the 45 min one. I turn 60 this year and have been hooked on THE FIRM for 5 years. I had bought some tapes in the interim and some CD's but they were compilations of older ones put together to create a work out.

This one is all new and it is fast-paced and you get a good cardio and muscle toning too. I work up a good sweat and feel good when I am done. I revert back to the old Firm tapes/cd's when I want to use the stepper, which as I am getting older don't feel so comfortable doing any longer.

All in all, ladies/gents, this is a good workout. Just give yourself some time for the learning curve. I tell you I could not do the QuadStar for a while...I wanted to zig when they zagged, but finally got it together. Really a fun workout! No doubt!",1209081600,3,961,3.819095477386935
2887722,4,B000SM6FJK,I really liked this workout. It took until the second or third time of doing of it to really get it down and realize how much I liked it. This is one of my favorites of the new firms. I like the choreography and especially the music in this workout. I usually pair this with another firm workout though. Most of the new firms are not as tough as previous ones that utilize the fanny lifter or the transfirmer but I do like not having to use a step everytime I workout. I think the new firms are really fun and good for beginners once they learn the moves and more intermediate to advanced exercisers can use higher weights and pair with another workout and get great results while having fun. I recommend this workout. It combines cardio with light weight lifting for an overall good workout.,1208304000,,792,4.394557823129252
2887723,4,B000SM6FJK,"I have used The Firm videos for nearly 12 years and I notice there are some definite pros and cons with this video.

PROS - It delivers a great workout, I am sweating harder each time I workout with this video.  You also do not need a lot of equipment, like step boxes, sculpting stick, etc.  Just some dumbells and yourself.  It is fast paced and high energy with good muscle toning exercises and great aerobic segments.  The time crunch exercise is very useful as well, which is why I bought this video.

CONS - The cueing is off at times, or unclear, so you have to be prepared to pay attention and willing to give yourself time to learn the routine with practice, patience is the key.  As I mentioned, I've used these products for over a decade and I found some new moves on this DVD that I have trouble executing with proper form.  This makes it very easy for injury to occur.  Be prepared to take things slowly, especially if you are just getting into weight/aerobic training.  The other drawback is the lack of information in these videos.  The old firm tapes used to have the instructors referring to the muscle groups, giving tips on how to use proper form, and emphasize what exercise works which muscles and how.  Like abduction and adduction, internal contractions, etc.  These new tapes do not do that which can hinder a person's execution of each exercise.

All in all, I give this a good rating because the workout does deliver and I can deal with the shortcomings, it just takes time and patience to learn the video and execute the routines properly.",1207785600,32,1566,4.526690391459074

2887726,2,B000SM6FJK,I found this workout to be a big letdown; perhaps becuase I am not a cardio type of person. I prefer tonning exercises. One of the things that disappointes me in this video is that the instrucor does not emphasize breathing in any moment. I also found that Rebekah's instruction lacks momentum. In other words she does not cue us into the next move. The video is annoying because I never know what do next as she steps from one excercise to another without warning.,1205539200,2,465,4.482352941176471

The express option is toning and sculpting, I've watched it but haven't done it. I love the main workout! It has a fun warmup with easy moves, the sculpting is great and has good variety, and the cardio is simple and non dancey but very effective. The ab work is a challenge (at least to me)- a bunch of bridges, leg extensions, lower ab lifts and crunches. The cool down is simple. Overall a great addition to any workout rotation. Rebekah's cuing is great and she keeps you informed about upcoming move changes.",1205107200,,619,4.486725663716814
2887729,5,B000SM6FJK,"This dvd is great for working out your whole body. The entire workout includes a warmup, three cardio routines, and in between each cardio is a sculpting/ weightlifting segment, then a quick (but painful) ab workout and a cooldown. I really liked the workout; it gets my heart rate up and is really good. I try to do the workout between 3 and 5 times a week and I began noticing results after the first week! The first couple of times you do it, you can expect to get a little mixed up and confused, but stick with it. It's fun and challenging and after once or twice through the moves become more familiar. I would recommend this to anyone who needs a good cardio workout.
Also, some people have mentioned back pain and such, and if you don't focus on using your abs to do the workout, then you could injure your back. I've done pilates for quite a while and they always teach you to use your abs to do the workout, not your back. I have found that some of the moves, when done improperly can put strain on your back, but if you pay attention, then when you notice any strain in your back you can correct the problem. This works for me and I haven't had any back pain.",1203033600,,1169,4.223214285714286
2887730,5,B000SM6FJK,"Of all of the ""new"" FIRM workouts, this one is my favorite, hands down.  Heart pumping cardio that is not too complex to learn, challenging weight training sections, and the option of a full 45 min or condensed 25 min format.

2887731,4,B000SM6FJK,"Unlike some of the other reviews, I did enjoy this one. I like Rebekah's style and think she has great potential. I can attribute some of the cueing issues to her being relatively new to the lead position on a DVD workout. The cueing was a little late and one segment in particular was fast(in my opinion) and hard to follow the first time I worked out with this DVD, but I have no doubt that I will have it down by the 2nd or 3rd time. It is no more hard to follow than the dance moves in the 3rd cardio segment of Alison's Cardio Boot Camp. Overall, I got the desired result-a good sweat with my heart rate elevated and some good muscle burn. What else do you need?",1202688000,,667,4.099236641221374

I was sorely dissapointed in the Total Body Time Crunch Video- First of all, the instructor didn't cue very well, spoke to quickly, and by the time I figured out what I was supposed to be doing she had moved on to the next move.  Secondly, when I did pause the DVD to get in the right position for the move (which I had to do every 2 seconds it seemed), the move wasn't challenging.  I would not recommend for someone that likes intermediate/advanced and medium/high impact cardio with weight training.  Womens Health's Amy Dixon is a better alternative.",1202428800,4,717,4.484615384615385

2887735,3,B000SM6FJK,"I like any fitness video that features strong, fit women - & not ""hot babes in spandex"". I purchased this video to get a video
that includes weights and no other props. I liked that there was a 45 min workout & an express workout to choose from.
I do not like learning a choreographed dance routine in lieu of cardio.  The weights portions are great.. and I like how each
section is sort of divided up so that you don't get bored waiting for the 45 minutes to pass. The host goes too fast, in my
opinion, with these ""dance""-like cardio steps. I will admit though, I broke a sweat and feel good about the workout.",1201564800,,612,4.230769230769231

This is an OK workout, except it has military dead lifts.  Against my better judgment, I did the military dead lifts on this on injured my lower back on the first trial of this video.

So, if you are prone to lower back problems, I'd either not get this one or skip the dead lifts.",1199664000,3,368,4.083333333333333

2887738,3,B000SM6FJK,"As with any exercise video I purchase, I watch it once before attempting to do it myself. I was excited at first glance but a little concerned about the prompting for the cardio segments. Just watching it I realized it was going to be fast and when I attempted to do it, I gave up. I tried it again and gave up. Tried again by only doing the cardio and hitting rewind but gave up yet again. Maybe it's just me but I don't want to have to scratch my head, trip over my feet, and keep hitting the review button when I'm trying to workout. I like a hard workout but I don't like working hard to figure out what the instructor is doing.

So, with that said, the workout itself was fine and I would give the DVD five stars for that. The only reason I give it three is for the prompting in the cardio segment. Perhaps they should have had the cardio moves on the Learn and Burn section or maybe she could have broken down each step at a slower pace.",1194825600,16,943,4.06989247311828

The instructor is great to work out with, and as for those who say that the cueing is bad.. just do the workout a few times and you will be able to catch on, the moves are really not that complex.. they are just interesting and different.

As noted by another reviewer Amazon is not listing this right, this is not the ""old"" Time Crunch with Susan Harris and Kai Soremekun. This is a ""new"" Time Crunch with Rebekah Sturkie.  She does a great job, cuing and sound are good.  It is a nice balance of aerobic bursts and weight work.  I did up the weights for me and by my second go at the DVD I had the moves down as they are not too dancy and complicated as some DVDs have been.  I'm 60 years old, working out about 1 hour each AM and have been looking for DVDs that have less high impact in them now and this works well for that - some high impact but not too much.

This caught my eye because it is from the new transFIRMATION series and from a new instructor, so I was hoping this was going to be good.  Well... I miss my transFIRMer.  I miss doing lunges on the incline, and using the transfirmer as a bench when I do chest press, etc... Maybe using only dumbbells might be pros for this exercise, but I found the exercise boring without use of steps.  The instructor was hard to follow - added moves too quickly before doing reps, not enough cueing).  I felt my back a little sore after the exercise, which is never the case with the other firm videos, maybe it is my bad forms but she did not give enough cues/reminders to stay in good form. Overall I'd stay away from this exercise.",1191110400,12,817,4.245161290322581
2887743,3,B000SM6FJK,"As far as the workout itself goes, it is fairly good.  Interval training, which is nothing new and very popular right now. It is nice that they did take out the weight section so if you are ""time crunched"" you can do just 25 mins of weights.  Too bad they didn't also do that with the cardio.  The cueing on the cardio is horrible though.  This is the first workout video that I actually watched all the way through, then did it.  Also the first video that I actually got ticked off enough by the cueing to turn it off and put a different dvd in.  They do make a point to tell you who is all on the screen, and who to fallow if you are a beginner, but don't bother showing her the majority of the time.  Nice that they don't require tons of extra exuipment either.  Just hand weights. They also don't make you sit through commercials before getting to the main menu.",1190764800,3,866,4.174698795180723

Rebekah is a natural in front of the camera and is just a joy to workout with.  The music is fun and I even found myself humming one of the tunes the other day... that is a rarity for Firm workouts.  The workout is 45 minutes and alternates cardio with toning, in classic Firm style.  There is an express pre mix with just the toning segments.  The only thing that could make this DVD perfect would be to have a cardio only premix, but you can use the skip button on your remote and do this yourself.  The cardio is all Hi-Low and the only equipment needed is a set of dumbells.  This workout is as easy or as hard as you make it and is really fun.

8205985,5,B000SM6FJK,I actually reordered this online because it helped me lose weight after college! a tad cheesy but incorporates weights and cardio and has a 20 min or 45 min option.,1499299200,,164,4.5
8205986,2,B000SM6FJK,"I have trouble understanding what the instructor is saying, it moves to fast for me and a few of the moves are confusing. But that's just me.",1413158400,,141,4.2592592592592595
8205987,5,B000SM6FJK,"LOVE IT!
rebekah's instructional cues have definitely improved; the moves are invigorating and all of the major muscle groups are worked.  i love cardio/weight training combos!  still alley is the best!",1405900800,,202,5.483870967741935
8205988,5,B000SM6FJK,"This is a great video - the full workout is a great blend of cardio and weights, while the short version is only the weights. Not bad if you're running low on time, though. One thing that's odd is I have 3 different videos from The Firm and they use the same terminology for different moves (e.g., Power Press, Dip and Scoop), so that can get confusing, but they all have good instruction so it's not bad. Highly recommend this one!",1405036800,,432,4.345679012345679
8205989,5,B000SM6FJK,"It gives me a good workout in a short amount of time.  It moves fast enough to get my heart rate up, but not so fast I can't keep up through the entire workout.  Moves are not complicated.  I was able to catch on in 4 or 5 workouts.",1386547200,,232,3.693877551020408
8205990,2,B000SM6FJK,"I didn't like it cause she went through the moves way too fast to keep up with her, most let you know what move going into and when to do it, this was bam right into the move sorry wasn't what I exspected it to be",1378425600,,213,3.652173913043478
8205991,5,B000SM6FJK,"I like the Firm workouts and this is one of my favorites.  The leader sometimes moves too quickly without direction, but the workout is good and interesting so I forgive her that. Good circuits workout!",1368748800,,202,4.771428571428571
8205992,4,B000SM6FJK,I only use the 25 min express workout because it is all strength training. I do not like firm cardio workouts at all. The movements are too hard for me to follow. I also do not like the warm up so I do my own before every workout. I think this may be more of a problem with me than the workout. Its kind of creepy the way the women smile the whole time. But I like it.  It's worth the money since it is so cheap.,1362873600,,412,3.735632183908046
8205993,5,B000SM6FJK,This is my favorite workout dvd that I own! Definately delivers great results. I have done this dvd at least 80 times all together :) love it! Once you get the moves down it is easier to follow. I also really like this instructor,1360886400,,229,4.2272727272727275
