3008526,5,B000XUOLR0,"What a great movie. Good acting, great music, easy to follow no nonsense plot and a happy ending. Wesley is arrested (again) and is sent to a half-way house run by Baptist Fred Willard, who is looking for kids who can play musical instrument so they can sing hymns. The music they sing is not very exciting (sorry Jesus) until Wesley discovers an autistic piano player (Vernon) who can wail.
Vernon has a low class dirt poor father who cares for him and doesn't want him playing in public. Vernon sneaks out to play in the band and of course trouble follows. The film moves along at a pretty good clip with no bad scenes to drag it down. For those who like good old fashion Taj Mahal blues, you won't want to miss this one.",1283558400,2,723,4.323529411764706
3008527,5,B000XUOLR0,"A movie about youth, friendship and loyalty with an amazing soundtrack and missing graphic sex scenes and violence, those don't come along very often and when you discover one buy it and treasure it. I stumbled onto this movie as an instant watch through Netflix, so why not, what did I have to lose. I lost nothing and gained hope, joy and insight. The next day I ordered the movie and have rewatched it several times. Never a fan, I have a new appreciation for the Blues. The music alone is worth watching this movie. Set in my home state of Missouri with few well known actors, the setting is authentic and the premise that talent can be found in the most unlikely places is plausable. The family dynamics, well-meaning social programs set in a small college town and unlikely friendships resulted in a film that is hopeful and heartwarming. Killer Diller is a Killer Diller movie.",1279584000,3,884,4.6369426751592355
3008528,5,B000XUOLR0,"This is a movie about an autistic savant that finds friends through music. I first saw this movie when I reviewed a bunch of screeners for a video store and this movie surprised me. I am in my early 20's and thought this was fun for movie night, or for a family night. Lots of humor built around a warm-hearted core.",1265932800,,316,4.19672131147541
3008529,4,B000XUOLR0,"After stumbling upon this movie accidentally, I ended up using it in my 6-12 music classes. The movie has an inspirational plot, showing that people of all races, gender, disability, or upbringing can succeed in something, regardless of any obstacles thrown their way (including bad choices).

I had a few parents even call me to ask where I found the movie - their kids had enjoyed it so much they asked to buy it. However, the success of the characters seemed to trivialize the crimes the teens had committed to land themselves in a halfway house, and only my high school class caught on to that concept.
It was a great movie for my students because it was filmed close to home, but also because many of them dealt with mental disabilities themselves - many could identify with the main character and it sparked some inspiration with them. I had several kids say, when the movie was over - ""If he can do it, so can I.""",1257033600,,920,4.508982035928144
3008530,4,B000XUOLR0,"The acting and plot are minimal here. If you watch just sit back and listen to the ""Killer Diller Blues Band."" The music is excellent thanks to a contribution from Keb Mo. It's mostly blues-rock with a few hymns thrown in just to keep up the church band part of the plot going.",1256515200,,277,4.245283018867925
3008531,5,B000XUOLR0,This was a very entertaining movie that anyone can enjoy. The music by the Killer Diller Blues Band is the best Contemperary blues I have heard in a while. I think we are in titled to have a soundtrack from this movie. Niki J. Crawford has a tremendous voice.,1238889600,3,259,4.3061224489795915
3008532,5,B000XUOLR0,The film is wholesome enough for children and engaging enough for adults.  The soundtrack is brilliant and the scenery stunning.  Had it been more widely released Lucas Black is likely to have won an award for his acting.,1216771200,2,221,4.7894736842105265

3008535,5,B000XUOLR0,"You can read the product description for a plot synopsis, I won't recap it here. Killer Diller is a wonderful surprise of a movie. The music rocks, the story is funny, sweet and uplifting and the acting is pure and completely believable. What a refreshing change from the tired, Hollywood formula movies. No ensemble cast, no overhyped overexposed actors, no phony sets. I love that it was filmed in central Missouri and I loved the reference to John Lee Hooker at the end. Perfect.",1200441600,10,482,4.75
3008556,3,B000XUOLR0,"The music in this movie is fabulous, and Lucas Black is terrific as a musical savant who finds a place for himself in a young gospel cum blues band. Unfortunately very little attention is given to the other characterizations in Clyde Edgerton's charming novel. Old pro character actors such as Fred Willard add much needed color to the film, but the story arc is choppy and unsatisfying. It would be worthwhile to fans of Taj Mahal and Keb Mo (including me) or Clyde Edgerton readers who haven't gotten to this novel (unfortunately I had read it).",1416700800,,547,4.708333333333333

They asked to watch it again and again. I don't want to give the story away but you will love the heart warming main characters and the beautiful talent they have. Set in North Carolina the scenery is beautiful as well. A definite must watch!!",1398988800,,385,4.287671232876712

Lucas Black was phenomenal playing an autistic piano savant! He rivals Dicaprio in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" any day. The other young actors as well as Fred Willard were ALL great as well! The blues music featuring Taj Mahal was worth watching the movie alone!

If you watch movies that show the gloom and doom of the world, and end with the hero getting killed, then buy one from the 1970's.
