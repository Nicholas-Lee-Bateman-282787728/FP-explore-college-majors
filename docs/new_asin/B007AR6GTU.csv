5072571,5,B007AR6GTU,"Our whole family is highly entertained by the Duggars and we learn and laugh with them.  Encouraging to not only see a family with faith on TV but actual prayer on TV - Wow!  In America ""tolerance"" is preached and now law - but unfortunately in the real world their is very little tolerance practiced towards Christians by non-Christians - especially when we know we belong to something so life changing wonderful  and try to share that good news. Hope to see the Duggars second generation continue keeping the faith and sharing their growth with us.",1393286400,,550,4.708333333333333

5072573,5,B007AR6GTU,"This family, even though larger than most American families by far, is an excellent example of love, adventure, hard work (teamwork), and faith, sprinkled with humor and human struggles.

5072576,3,B007AR6GTU,"I recently purchased this dvd set through TLC/Discovery Channel, and I was very disappointed when I watched the episodes and realized there were many of them missing from that season. One of the ones missing was when Josh and Anna had their son Michael. I have contacted TLC and am waiting for a response. There were at least three other episodes missing as well, and most of them were completely out of order.",1336521600,18,410,4.63013698630137
