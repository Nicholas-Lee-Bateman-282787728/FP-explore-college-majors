5731404,5,B00COBWXIK,"I saw this film in the theater, and have been telling friends and family about it ever since.  This movie was just incredibly powerful.  You really get inside the characters, and look at the world through their perspective.  This creates a powerful emotional experience, one with unusual depth.  The acting was superb, especially the child.  Southerners will appreciate the authentic portrayal of the nuances of life in the South, especially the way in which emotionally difficult subjects are handled or avoided by the characters--that rang really true for me.  And even though parts of it were very sad (ok I had tears running down my face through a big part of it) the strength and goodness of the main characters held me steady through the viewing, and I walked out feeling connected to the human race in a very positive way.

I can't wait for the DVD to arrive so that I can watch it again and share it with friends.  This is a film that is very comfortable to watch with anyone, friends, family, teens... it has a universal appeal.",1371859200,5,1037,4.69060773480663
5731405,5,B00COBWXIK,"""In the Family"" is one of the most humanistic films I have ever seen.  I say humanistic because the film is ultimately about the significance of love and it's overriding power to come to the fore of our relationships.  The film is enhanced immeasurably by the quite and confident performance of Patrick Wang who is also the director.  I feel quite confident in saying that those people who take the time to see the film will find the experience to be extremely satisfying and reaffirming in regards to what we all truly value.  There's a reason the film has a 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.  It has hit a nerve that is undeniable.",1369008000,3,630,4.539823008849558
5731406,5,B00COBWXIK,"I saw this movie twice in the theater with audiences who were rapt, in certain places even softly gasping at the quiet surprises in the tremendously moving storyline.

Patrick Wang is not only a masterful actor and writer but also the best kind of director who chooses exactly the right actor for every part and brings out of those actors the depth of character with a minimum of movement and expression. Wang's work with the cinematographer puts not only every scene at the edge of the frame, but also the nerves of the audience who learn what it is and what it means to be literally ""on edge"", to be outside or as nearly outside of the community as a body can get.

Yet there are no villains here:  all the characters are rich and motivated by only the best motivations; that is what makes the conflict so gripping and so human.

In so many reviews of this extraordinary film there are nods to the length of the movie as if it might be considered a detriment, but the length and slowness are immediately recognizably integral to the film, the fullness and emptiness of the same moment in time, the hugeness of the emotion yet the tiny pinpricks of all of the hurts and poignancies within that emotion, brilliant and excruciating and dear.

I have ordered six copies to give to my best friends since they were unable to see the movie in the movie theater.  I think anyone who sees this movie will want to do the same because it is not only unique, not only profound to the deepest part of one's psyche and love, but utterly fulfilling.

5731407,5,B00COBWXIK,"Powerful. Subtle. Deliberate. Immersive. Inspirational. Challenging. Groundbreaking.

""In the Family"" is not about the knee-jerk morality questions our society regularly pontificates on the surfaces of right and wrong. Rather, it is about multiple layers of meaning behind such words as truth, innocence, justice, empathy, compassion, family, and love as they actually play out in the real, down-to-earth lives that we live together as a human family. This film is no less than an indie-masterpiece.",1368748800,5,499,5.743243243243243

The second time, I was able to simply bask in the beauty and power of the film. The Q&As were long, open conversations lasting over an hour. I am looking forward to another opportunity to see In the Family and I can't wait to tear through the additional material that is packaged with it.

5731409,5,B00COBWXIK,"This film is certainly not for everyone, at almost 3 hours length, with minimal soundtrack and mostly static shots. But I sat riveted until the end, as did most of the audience in the theater.

The plot sounds melodramatic: a gay Asian man fights for the custody of the son he shared with his deceased lover. But writer/director Patrick Wang, who seems clearly influenced by the understated Yasujiro Ozu and Ang Lee, avoids the easy moral conflicts. Instead, he focuses on the daily lives of mostly average and good hearted people. There are no stereotype villains here. Instead of a Hollywood court battle, we have an almost documentary like deposition meeting that still manages to be dramatic and emotionally true.

The cast is uniformly terrific, especially young Sebastian Banes as Chip and Brian Murray as the lawyer. Certain quietly powerful scenes still stay with me, like the kitchen scene post-funeral and Chip replaying the audiotape of his father's voice calling his name. Patrick Wang will be a talent to follow! This was also a favorite of the late Roger Ebert, a champion of small independent gems.",1368662400,6,1113,4.978494623655914
5731410,5,B00COBWXIK,"Many critics could argue, perhaps convincingly, that ""In the Family"" could be edited from its almost 3 hours to 2 hours, however, the pacing of the film doesn't suffer from its length. And by taking time to develop the almost mundane everyday life of a gay couple raising a young son, the film is actually a bold political statement that speaks directly to every person who thinks being gay is somehow a non-stop sex fest. Because of that, the film makes a very strong point even before the issues at the heart of the movie become front and center. It's a family friendly film where sexual orientation is almost an afterthought of the movie and that is what sets the tone and makes it groundbreaking. That is a long winded way of saying that anyone who thinks the film should fit into a typical 2 hour movie formula, is missing the depth of the story and the emotional impact the pacing creates.

Many Asian-American actors would say they hate doing accents because they are connected with stereotypical roles, but Patrick Wang's southern accent probably wasn't what Asian-American actors had in mind and in this case it is a testament to Patrick's incredible acting abilities. I am one who thinks directors should direct and not also take on the demand of acting in their own films because both can suffer, but Patrick Wang's acting and directing are both amazing. He has embraced this film heart and soul and it's evident in its emotional complexity and perhaps this is a case where it could not have been as successful without Patrick in both roles.

In the film the downward spiral starts with the confrontation between Joey (Patrick Wang) and Chad's sister over the will and is a riveting scene that doesn't leave the viewer rooting for anyone, but actually feeling the pain and the point each is making about the circumstances. But for Joey it is the most devastating because everything in his life is gone overnight; his partner, his child, and his home. The loneliness and destruction of his life is powerfully and beautifully created by Patrick's acting and directing making this a heart wrenching film that shouldn't be missed. And the film's conclusion? Emotionally brilliant.",1368662400,13,2187,4.8293333333333335
5731411,5,B00COBWXIK,"I have been advocating for this film ever since I first saw it in Chicago. When it came back to Chicago, I went to see it again. I am dumbfounded that it wasn't considered for an Academy Award.

Patrick Wang's direction is thoughtful, well-considered, and a pleasant change from traditional Hollywood film making. Scenes in which the action is happening off-camera carry more impact than had the action been filmed.

The film's subject matter -- same-sex families, two dads, fighting relatives over child custody, death, loss, homophobia, race, love -- could have easily turned this film into a maudlin mess were it not for Wang's skillful screenwriting, directing, and acting. The film also skillfully avoids being overtly political despite the subject matter. I'm writing my own first screenplay and I've learned a lot just from repeatedly watching this film.

I know it sounds like hyperbole, but this is seriously the best film I've seen in years.",1368662400,19,951,5.083333333333333

The young actor playing Chip was remarkable.  The actor playing Chips uncle I recognize at Marishka Hargitay's husband.  He's a good actor.  I didn't think the actor playing Joey, the aunt, or Joey's attorney were that good.

The film really helped me understand just a little bit more of some of the challenges that same-sex couples encounter.  I have a few friends in same-sex relationships and they have often mentioned various things like what would happen if one were to die.  We all think of that, but heterosexual couples have much less uncertainty if they choose.

Not being able to see their loved one in the hospital.  And then having to sort out the legal stuff will still in pain from losing their partner.  Family is about the people that love each other and take care of each other.  Being a gay man you realize you have the family you are born with and the family that you love.  The movie is very long, but done so well.  It portrays a loving family with 2 dads.  Both working and supporting time with a son.  Very involved with his life.  No different than a family with a mom and a dad, or a family with 2 moms.  I thought the film was well done and showed us how short life can be.

5731427,4,B00COBWXIK,"B+/A-

Excellent movie, but too long.  Otherwise, I might have given it an A.  Don't let that deter anyone from seeing it.  I liked the movie and tried to like it more. I watched it with some gay friends who thought it too long. I had to agree.

The film is obviously a work of love and Mr. Wang's ""baby.""  Still, parts did drag.  I don't know if he was too close to it or too short on funds to hire a good independent film editor.  (Looking at the credits, I saw only the positions of Post-Production Sup'r and Assistant Editor.)

I fell in love with the main character, Joey Williams, and with the directory/writer Patrick Wang (who also played Joey) as he explained some shooting and editing decisions on the bonus disc (Disc 2, Extras).  The director was thoughtful and gentle in his discussion.

One element missing from the movie was showing how his son Chip reacted to his pa's death.  After the memorial service, we see how Chip ""took care of"" his dad as his dad sat in stunned silence.  (This was one of the scenes that dragged out.)

It seemed a useful lesson that the lawyer he finally got showed him that he didn't have to butt heads against the law but that he could use the law simply to get an audience (in the form of a deposition) with Chip's legal guardians, the sister and brother-in-law of Cody, his deceased partner.",1442620800,,1337,4.404081632653061
5731428,5,B00COBWXIK,"Sebastian Banes is a beautiful child who really shines in a movie about just what constitutes a real family. The script, acting, and directing are all first rate. The story plays out beautifully about a man who is seeking custody of a boy to whom he is not related except for the fact that he help raise the boy along with the boy's father, who was the man's gay lover. Is this man's love for the boy enough to make them family? That's the question this movie seeks to explore. And it does so brilliantly. Sebastian Banes won a young artist award in the 2013 awards ceremony for his role in the film. And it was a much-deserved win. Regardless of your views about gays, don't miss this movie. The movie is not about gays, it is about one man's love for a child and it will touch your heart.",1439078400,5,790,4.273333333333333

Long films - especially slower paced ones like this is - tend to drag on, but whenever I watch this film it never feels like it was longer than your average two-hour movie.  The pacing is excellent, the storytelling is top-notch, and the acting is phenomenal.

When it did, I bought three copies, one for myself and the others to give to a friend and to my local gay community centre for its library. What I love about this film is that every actor in it made me believe they are who they portray. I also really, really enjoyed how Wang did not rust - ever - in telling the story.

I have no idea how Patrick Wang has pulled off this amazing work, but somehow he got me to stick with him for almost three hours and to watch uncut scenes within his tapestry for upwards of nine minutes on some occasions.  As I watched, I felt so many things:  love, hate, rage, sorrow.  And then the climax turns everything I thought and everything I expected upside down.  I'm not gay, I'm not asian, I'm not an orphan, I'm not in a custody battle, and I shouldn't care about any of these things.  But I am human, and access my humanity Wang did accomplish.

5731447,5,B00COBWXIK,"I have known some who write about a thrilling subject, but in such a way as to put us all to sleep. I have also known skilled story tellers who can talk about something as mundane as washing dishes and yet have us on the edge of our seats. For those of us who value stories, this is a gift and this particular gift comes to us from Patrick Wang.

""In The Family"" has simple scenes of domesticity that captivate. A man quietly sits at a kitchen table while a young boy takes a soda out of a refrigerator, slides over a chair to stand on so he can reach a glass in a cupboard. In another scene, we see the back of a man's head as he repairs the binding of a book. Patrick Wang gives us freedom to imagine the expression on his face. How can that be compelling? When the writer and director has talent. When the seemingly simple scene actually tells us something important. Just as Hitchcock said, that is pure film. No dialogue was necessary; in fact dialogue would have spoiled those two scenes.

This is a story about a child custody case located in a time when same sex marriage is not yet a reality in most states, a time when homosexuality is still a hot button subject for many. This film could have been filled with many over the top scenes, yet this  mature screenplay does not resort to them. Two of the protagonists are gay and yet I do not remember hearing the word ""gay"" in this film because homosexuality has not particularly been made an issue.  One character faces unbelievable odds and yet is encouraged by someone to believe that his case is not without hope. I found myself almost holding my breath in anticipation, waiting to hear how hope could be found in an an unlikely circumstance.

Patrick Wang gives us plenty of time to know the characters, yet at no time is the story slow. Patrick Wang has shown us an ordinary man's shirt, but by juxtaposing two scenes has invested it with meaning.

""In The Family"" shows us what is possible with only a minimum amount of money and with a great deal of talent. First rate directing debut and first rate story telling.

This DVD and BluRay will play anywhere in the world because they contain no regional encoding.",1375056000,4,2175,4.395522388059701

Some of the small roles should have been cast more carefully. Cinema verite doesn't work very well when the people are so ""real"" that one can't believe they actually are real.

5731451,5,B00COBWXIK,"What does it mean to be a family? For some family is defined as one man, one woman, both attached to God, with children and an eternal sealing. For others (including me) family is defined as a group of people who love each other. Simple.

Joey and Cody have raised their son, Chip, for at least 5 years together. Normal, every-day routines of two loving parents and one lucky child begin the film. Then, suddenly, Cody dies. Joey and Chip are left behind, numb, grieving and being pulled back into the every-day. Life seems to go on.

Until Joey is informed of Cody's will. It states that Chip, along with all of Cody's possessions, belongs to Cody's sister and husband. Joey is quickly pushed out of the picture and left without any legal custody of his son. Thus begins a slow, powerful journey of understanding, love, and family.

In The Family is 169 minutes long. It is drawn out, subtle, and realistic. There isn't any background music. Many scenes don't include dialogue. It is simply a window into the life of these characters. It lets us see them for who they are, watch them eat, talk, and try to understand the bumps of life and their bruises from them. It is an art film, an indie film, and a quietly powerful experience, one which benefits from more than one viewing. Film: 4/5 STARS

The video quality is nearly perfect. The material is presented neatly. None of this film is flashy, but rather subdued and realistic. This style of film looks good on Blu-ray. Video: 5/5 STARS

Audio is good. The film is filled with conversations and real-life sounds. Dialogue is easy enough to hear. Audio: 4/5 STARS

Extras include video essays and written essays that are especially interesting. The Blu-ray case fits the mood of the film, with a booklet inside and a sturdy enough slipcover. Extras: 3.5/5

Overall: 4.5/5 STARS. A powerful, realistic film. Highly recommended!

8583946,4,B00COBWXIK,"The movie was slow going in spots and I almost gave up a few times but something made me stick with it.  I'm glad I did.  It covers an important topic - and makes you realize you should not take for granted that everything will always work out if there is no legal work filed to protect family rights, etc.  Joey was a kind, decent, hardworking man whose past has been filled with loss who learned the hard way about talking about the ""big stuff"" in order to prevent such a scenario from happening again.  From the scenes where he finally got a lawyer and the deposition scenes, I was really, really glad I stayed with this film.",1525478400,,629,4.305084745762712
8583947,5,B00COBWXIK,This one took a bit to grab me but it did grab me.  It starts out a bit slow and then all of a sudden I found myself caring about Joey and what was happening to him.  Its very well done and not at all about gays if that bothers you.  It doesn't bother me.  It was about his love for a child who wasn't technically his own but that he'd helped raise and it was very well done.  The little boy is absolutely adorable and did an outstanding job with his character.  Everyone did.  Its a bit long but well worth the watch.,1518739200,,518,3.923076923076923

8583953,5,B00COBWXIK,"Absolutely loved the story itself and that is why I gave it 5 stars. The only problem I had is with some of the poor cinematography. In certain places, the camera shook so much I had to look away from the tv. I didn't care for the fade to black parts either, because the pause between the scenes was too long, at one point, I thought I'd lost connection because it took so long. But even with this stuff it did not take away from the actual story.",1513468800,,447,4.090909090909091
