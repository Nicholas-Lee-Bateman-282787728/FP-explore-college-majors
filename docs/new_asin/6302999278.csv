532048,5,6302999278,"Jean Renoir's moody adaptation of Emile Zola's book features one of Gabin's seminal pre-war performances, and an arresting turn by the sexy Simon (who'd venture stateside four years later to make ""The Cat People""). Renoir's vivid location shooting around trains and train stations portrays the dusty anonymity of one isolated man, while serving as metaphor for a numb, bewildered nation about to enter the dark tunnel of occupation. A stunning, unsettling film from an acknowledged master.",1182729600,3,489,5.447368421052632
532049,3,6302999278,"Jean Renoir made his version of Zola's novel. What is fun here is the fabulous sights we see while on the train thru France. Beatiful b&w photography, mind you.

Now, the story I didn't quite get it. I didn't get to care too much about the afflicted engineer; his psyche is really weird to me. Then there's his relationship with the unorthodox femme fatal, for whom I didn't care much either. So the study of characters isn't the best one I've seen in film history.

In brief, boring but beautiful. There are better Renoir films to choose from.",1169769600,3,544,4.540816326530612
532050,4,6302999278,"One of the first symbols they teach you about in film critic school (Symbolism Clichs 101) is the big, black locomotive, which represents male sexual libido. Blame Freud and, well, your id. Man is a sexual beast and his dreams - the manifestation of an unconscious mind allowed to conjure any vision fathomable - are mostly the repeated image of his own sex organ.

Jean Renoir's La Bete Humaine (The Human Beast) has a lot of locomotives, so many in fact that it probably slots in between The General and Murder on the Orient Express on the all-time list of most locomotive-saturated frames per minute of running time. Those pictures, perhaps surprisingly, are relatively free of sexual menace (though the Agatha Christie adaptation features the always phallic death by stabbing, if you're so inclined - a little more on this later). The same cannot be said of Humaine, a film that doesn't just feature the darker elements of our carnal natures, but is consumed by them.

Jacques Lantier (Jean Gabin from Renoir's own Grand Illusion) is a train engineer. His dirty clothes and ashen face camouflage him with the locomotive on which he rides - man and (sex) machine appear as one. A faulty axel on ""Lison"" will foreshadow Lantier's own ""mechanical"" problem where he visits a lady friend and attempts to have his way (where else?) beside some train tracks; overcome by feelings of inadequacy in the face of (what we can only presume) an inability to consummate, he throttles her for his own impotence. A passing train interrupts his manic and violent outburst and Lantier is immediately regretful, blaming some ambiguous and undiagnosed disease of the blood he believes was passed to him from grandfather to father to son. ""Is that part of your illness?"" she asks him. She means the hands that were about her throat and not the passing train, though she might as well have.

The other doomed man of this story is amiable stationmaster Roubaud (Fernard Ledoux), introduced as he reprimands a rich man for walking his dog on the train platform. It might be petty but Roubaud shows no favorites regardless of class or connections. ""Some people need to be taught a lesson,"" says the woman who brought the complaint. Roubaud agrees, or at least thinks he does. As is usually the case, the person that brings about his eventual downfall is Roubaud himself... but he has an accomplice.

Enter his much-too-pretty-for-a-schlub-like-him wife, Severine (Simone Simon), who spends her days tending to caged birds on their balcony (whose symbolism need not be elaborated upon), shopping, and cuckolding poor, naive Roubaud with the men of the neighborhood. One of these men happens to be an individual of some social standing and a former employer, Grandmorin - Roubaud's discovery of this wealthy man's intimate knowledge of his wife infuriates him to the point of premeditated murder (by stabbing, the modus operandi of every sexually frustrated killer) aboard - you guessed it - a train. Unfortunately for Roubaud, a witness in Lantier is standing a few feet away when the crime takes place and the fate of two men become intertwined.

Though not to the extent of his Upstairs/Downstairs farce La Regle du Jeu, Renoir here is overtly aware of class relationships and class warfare (one memorable scene takes place as the train workers scrape their dinner out of cans, congratulating each other on how much money they saved their bosses on coal that day - the technology that brings us together also divides), even expressing some welcome cynicism at the working class hero vs. robber baron boiler plates that tend to dominate. Roubaud does not want Grandmorin's ""cast offs,"" a strange thing to call one's wife no matter how far she's been passed around. He does, however, have no problem taking the dead man's wallet - only to deflect blame and the attention of law enforcement, of course (and wouldn't it be a waste to just throw out all this money?).

Later, Severine (whose infidelity prompted the original bloodshed) is practically gifted to Lantier by her husband, an exchange for the man's silence. Inevitably, when a budding romance blooms between the two, it does so at night in a lamp-lit train yard. Peering up at a big, black locomotive locomotive, Serverine asks Lantier ""May I get on?"" ""You'll get all dirty,"" he says.

Indeed.

Interesting footnote: Director Jean Renoir is the son of famed expressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir. He was the subject of many of his father's works in which he is often portrayed, at best, sexual ambiguous, and at worst, as a girl, resulting in much childhood torment at the hands of bullies. See the painting Jean Renoir Sewing for one particularly egregious example.",1168992000,8,4709,4.951898734177215
532051,5,6302999278,"La Bete Humaine is my favorite Renoir and one which tends to divide many of his critics and admirers. For me it's an exhilarating and involving piece of cinema with characters destroyed by and destroying themselves in events in much more credible circumstances than in Regle du Jeu, which gives it some real emotional and thematic weight beyond mere parlor games - not to mention having the thrill of seeing post WW1 French doomed romanticism evolving into proto-film noir before your very eyes. These characters truly do all have their reasons and find their attempts to control events and other people backfiring spectacularly as they lose control in a way that none of the mannequins in Regle do. But it's all subjective. Jean Gabin is superb, the use of locations exemplary and Simone Simon was a babe, even if she does try to bite!",1166227200,3,836,4.8125
532052,5,6302999278,"I'm not a great fan of Renoir, but here his style works well. He's good at photography, and usually weak on story flow - too loaded with sentiment. This heavy theme works well under his control. The print is generally good, and the extras are copius and very interesting. The psychological depictions feel authentic. Gabin's character is difficult to understand. This is not a flaw, because he is like so many real people I've encountered, difficult to understand because of their internal conflicts. His conflicts have been controlled and muted by limiting his life's focus to the train. Although his sidekick sometimes border on the ""straight man"", he never quite goes over the line. It contrasts well with the deep darkness of Gabin's character.

In summary: A great movie, a good repro, and a fine disc set.",1163116800,12,811,4.91970802919708
532053,5,6302999278,"A passionate story of illicit love that can only end tragically - and it does. Jean Gabin is a train engineer who witnesses a murder on the train: a jealous and brutal husband (Fernand Ledoux) has killed his boss in a fit of jealousy after he learns that his wife (Simone Simon) has slept with him to get her husband his job. Suspecting Gabin has seen the murder take place, he sends Simone to him to ""convince"" him to keep his mouth shut about it, and before long he and Simon are lovers. Typically, the lovers conclude that the only way they can be together as they wish is to do away with Ledoux, but Gabin can't bring himself to do it.

Early in the film it's hinted that Gabin had once suffered from depression with destructive impulses, and now this comes into play; however, he kills Simone instead of Ledoux. Gabin then commits suicide by leaping from his speeding train. Gabin is fascinating in his role, as is the beautiful Simone - their love scenes are passionate without being overdone. In fact, the entire cast rivets out attention throughout the movie. The train sequences - all filmed on location with no back projections - are powerful and exciting. Renoir's direction is also superb. An excellent movie; definitely worth a watch.",1140480000,7,1247,4.642533936651584
532054,5,6302999278,"The majestic camera eye of Jean Renoir linked to his natural refinement plus the photographic and demolisher novel of Emile Zola denominated very often as one the supreme exponents of the ""French Realism"" produced a movie of colossal dimensions and artistic stature.

The disaffections, the murder, the ontological loneliness, the devastated oppression of dementia atmosphere, the terrible familiar backgrounds of this disturbed mind Lantier converges in a love affair when finally discover the love of his life is guilty of a crime being accomplice of her previous lover. The final proof of his love will be kill him but something hidden far beyond of our free will, will intervene to twist the fixed road for these two lovers.

Monumental performances of Jean Gabin and Simone Simon.

532055,4,6302999278,"Although the identifying phrase ""Film Noir"" was yet to be used for another few decades, Jean Renoir's ""La Bete Humaine"" could arguably be considered one of the genre's blueprints. In fact, aside from the over-melodramatic music score, this naturalistic 1938 thriller looks and feels very contemporary. Jean Gabin is quite effective as the brooding train engineer plagued by ""blackouts"" in which he commits acts of uncontrollable violence, usually precipitated by moments of passion (Freudians will have a field day with all the point-of-view camerawork showing Gabin chugging his big, powerful locomotive through long dark tunnels). The beautiful Simone Simon sets the mold for all future Femme Fatales with an earthy, Sophia Loren-type sexuality not usually found in movies from the 1930's. In fact, it would be another 30 years or so before American crime films like ""In Cold Blood"" and ""Bonnie And Clyde"" would adapt a similar blend of adult language, sexuality and unflinching violence (in 1938, Hollywood was too busy pumping out Shirley Temple movies). Moody cinematography and a general existential malaise certainly doesn't make this a ""feel good"" popcorn movie, but fans of classic Noir will be fascinated. (Note: this film was remade in 1954 as ""Human Desire"").",1047254400,24,1271,5.36
532056,3,6302999278,"An extremely gritty adaptation of one of Zola's most intense novels.  The sequences down the Paris - Le Havre track are superbly evocative of the main characters' inability to escape their destiny.  Character-wise,  though, the film takes a while to get going, and the scene of Lantier's  (Gabin's) first blackout and possession by ""the beast within"" is  contrived, poorly acted and not at all convincing.  Things improve,  thankfully.  Updating the plot to the 1930s doesn't quite work in the sense  that the protagonists' difficult living conditions in the novel are an  important cause of their actions.  With one noteable exception, the score  is 1930s over-intrusive.  And why oh why did Renoir change Zola's ending,  which is far more powerful than the film's ho-hum-is-it-over? final scene.",955929600,7,797,5.272

7833817,5,6302999278,"A magnificent film with great acting, writing, editing and cinematography.. It moves right along, at times literally.  The great Jean Renoir wrote and directed it.  Jean Gabin, considered by many to be the embodiment of French cinema, shows in this film why that is so.  Simone Simon is a fantastic femme fatale, a real trailblazer.

Some say Double Indemnity was the first film noir but this is the real granddaddy of them all.  Try it, you'll like it.",1442793600,4,453,4.756410256410256
7833818,3,6302999278,"i love French films, but the American version of this classic story by Emil Zola beats this movie all the way.  Human Desire (the 1954 version directed by Fritz Lang) is better crafted and features a superior cast that included Glen Ford, Gloria Graham and Broderick Crawford.

7833820,5,6302999278,"La Bete Humaine is one of the great 20th century works of art, combining the searing dark world  of Emile Zola's novel with Jean Renoir's brilliant filmmaking. The shots of roaring steam engines alone are worth the price of admission.",1350950400,4,234,4.85
7833821,5,6302999278,"""La Bete Humaine"" is one of my favourites of all Emile Zola's novels.  This famous film version, directed by Jean Renoir in 1938, is a clever adaption of the main characters in the book, the unfortunate Lantier (Jean Gabin), the kittenish and deadly Severin (Simone Simon) and her dour husband Roubaud (Fernand Ledoux). The book is more complex with many more sub-plots but it would have been impossible to incorporate it all so the changes are just fine, particularly as the mood has been recreated cleverly. There are many enlightening reviews on Amazon so I simply summarise as follows:

- this is a Criterion package so the print has been restored from the best possible sources and is very good, preserving the stunning composition which was integral to Renoir's skill.
- the extras include some very important interviews which assist the novice enormously to understand the gravity of the film, particularly if the viewer is unfamiliar with the source material. Peter Bogdanovich is entertaining and to the point as always but more importantly, there are two interviews/segments with Renoir himself, one in which he introduces the film for a screening on TV in the late 50s and the other when he recreates directing Simone Simon.
- best of all, the package contains a booklet with 3 really excellent essays about the film, the novel and the production itself. These are invaluable.

As usual, Criterion have made a significant contribution to the preservation and reincarnation of an important classic film.",1299628800,6,1513,5.068273092369478
7833822,5,6302999278,"Don't try to get a homicidal maniac to try to kill your husband, especially if he prefers women.  A wonderful fun film filled with great shots of train rides from the engine room.  Jean Gabin is a man with an urge to kill women.  Simone Simon is a woman who has been sexually abused by her godfather through adolescence and her husband doesn't like it.  Everyone is working class, works hard and doesn't exactly do anything past struggle for the best life possible.  Thus sets the stage for a Film Noir from France.  A dark sad tale of people who aren't able to control their lives very much and their efforts to control their lives are usually destructive and damaging.  Jean Renoir's most profitable film and most conventional in some sense but in another, he helped invent a new genre of film.  The story is initially one from Emile Zola so the setting of the story is paramount and the characters are reactors to their surroundings.  Really entertaining and clever.",1280793600,11,969,4.652941176470589

But Lantier is keeping quiet about it, because he wants Severine for himself.  Ultimately Lantier and Severine do become lovers and she starts nagging him to kill her murderous husband.

Renoir delivers some of the most beautifully photographed pictures of trains and train tracks, and rural France, ever seen, making striking, poetic, thematic use of the railroad.  He paints the self-sufficient railroad community in memorable color for a black and white film. He draws from the very beautiful Simon a performance that helped define the femme fatale forever more, as well as defining forever more a woman who really loves her cat.  Gabin is never less than  hypnotic as the tragic Lantier, who, apparently, has inherited some sort of family mental illness, possibly, as we know now, a chemical dysfunction of the brain, and is subject to uncontrollable violent outbursts.  Lantier's inherited illness is truly the heart of the film. Personally, although all this is mentioned in a little preface to the film, I'm still not entirely sure what that's supposed to be about, except that it is apparently the heart of the Zola book, with which I am not familiar.  Nevertheless, although this film is less famous than some of Renoir's others, it is certainly worth seeing for Renoir's direction, and Gabin's muscular performance.",1279929600,2,2924,6.872972972972973
7833824,5,6302999278,"A startling look at the inner demons of mankind, Jean Renoir's tragic film noir `La Bete Humaine' is one of the finest additions to cinema.  It is equal parts chilling and seductive, with powerful performances, stylistic direction and heart-racing tension.  `La Bete Humaine' is a perfectly concocted film that covers nearly every base with a clear vision that is destined to stain your soul.

The film tells two different stories that intertwine to make one very concise and profound tale.  We have Jacques Lantier (a brilliant Jean Gabin), a train engineer who has a very mysterious and apparently violent past.  He has no relationship outside of the one with his train, but there is a reason for that.  On the other hand we have Severine (a stunning and utterly delicious Simone Simon) and her jealous husband Roubaud.  When Roubaud finds out of a previous relationship he finds distasteful he takes matters into his own hands and commits a heinous crime, a crime that Jacques finds himself privy.

The film straddles the line of thriller and film noir with its tasteful handling of the chemistry between Gabin and Simon.  There is a restrained theatrical tampering with their love affair (the stills this movie creates with the two of them standing side by side are so in your face yet breathtakingly quiet) that really gets my temperature rising.  It's a beautifully handled love story that really unravels at a velocity I find stunning.

The film appears to completely ditch the development of Lantier's violent past when Roubaud commits murder, but this is a clever diversion to something that is growing and growing with each scene.  We are taking away from the point of the film through a series of beautifully paced scenes involving Severine and her husband so that when Jacques succumbs to his obsessions we are blown away by the outcome.

But should we be?

I have not read the novel from which this film was adapted, but my appetite has been wetted.  There is a marvelously crafted story here of the mind.  The mind is a very complicated gift, and this film takes no precautions in portraying that mind as something unexplainable and truly contradictory.  I love the fact that one is almost left confused by the ending, as if the story is incomplete, but it is that incompleteness that really elevates the tale and is precisely the point.

Sometimes there are no explanations for our actions.",1257206400,2,2405,4.867321867321867
