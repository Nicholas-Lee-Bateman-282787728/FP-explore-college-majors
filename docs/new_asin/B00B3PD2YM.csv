Shi-Won and Yun-Jae are two of the best characters in any Korean drama, their story is believable, funny, and enjoyable. Each role was well-cast, so chemistry definitely was not an issue for this show. Eun-Ji (APink) and Seo In-Guk were great as the leads as their chemistry shifts throughout the story. My only complaint was that, yea, the ending was a bit predictable, but that was okay. With this, I wish the show was longer than 16 episodes! It's a great drama for anyone interested in K-pop culture, great storytelling, romance, comedy, K-pop music, and some of the little Easter eggs Eastern and Western culture would notice (especially if you're someone who follows baseball or K-pop). Please watch and enjoy!",1390176000,,850,4.86896551724138
8562158,5,B00B3PD2YM,"Reply 1997 is one of the best Korean dramas ever made if not the best of all. I watch Korean dramas regularly and I can tell you that the story is great. The drama showed the everyday life of 6 friends during the year 1997, when kpop bands H.O.T and Secsh Kies were popular. I highly recommend this drama. You'll love the relationship of Shi-Won and Joon-Jae, you will laugh with the antics of Shi Won's father and those of the six main characters.

P.S. - one thing that have every Korean drama is awfully bad endings but, I can tell you that's not the case with Reply 1997. I didn't want it to end.",1386979200,2,600,4.217391304347826
