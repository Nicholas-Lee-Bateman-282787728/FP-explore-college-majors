8180695,3,B000NQDF94,Bettina Gregory hosts this series. It is fairly good for illustrating bipolar disorder to students and as a psychoeducation tool for families. She is melodramatic at times and tries way to hard to get the obvious point across. This is a fairly decent DVD for the price.,1200355200,2,269,4.74468085106383
8180696,4,B000NQDF94,"I purchased this DVD for my boyfriend, because he's not a big reader.  He viewed it at least 4 times, and was able to remember key points, which helped him understand my bipolar disorder better. We're getting along much better as a couple, now that he realizes I'm not intentionally trying to hurt him when I have an 'episode'. I recommend this DVD for family members and loved ones to view.",1195257600,7,391,4.507042253521127
