7991418,1,B00009MEEI,Useless. Very old information. Only one session with a lady instructor. All others were men from what seemed like the 1970s or 1980s.,1391644800,,133,4.826086956521739
7991419,3,B00009MEEI,"Naturally I expected ""Women's Golf Instruction with Donna White and Friends."" to be instruction for women and mostly by Donna White.  There were seven programs, but not mostly by Donna White and not even by other women instructors and not even really specifically related to women's issues in the golf world (women's physical differences as they relate to swing mechanics, distance, equipment choices, tactical approaches, etc.)  It was OK, but just not what I expected, and not what the title led me to expect.",1372204800,3,511,5.071428571428571
7991420,4,B00009MEEI,I bought this dvd for my daughter who is just starting to play golf. She really liked the illustrations and has been practicing the techniques for several months now.  I would recommend Donna's portion of the lessons for the beginner and novice golfer.,1293926400,6,252,4.8604651162790695
