2920114,5,B000UANYN0,A wonderful story of a whale and good for the whole family to watch. Very educational and I think everyone will enjoy it!,1354492800,,121,4.304347826086956
2920115,5,B000UANYN0,this movie talks to the spirit and soul and teaches how to cultures can be one if it is done right,1283904000,,98,3.7142857142857144
2920116,5,B000UANYN0,"Personally, I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! It is a great movie for the whole family to watch. A movie with a moving story and a ending that will leave you smiling. The scenery and underwater photography was amazing and the actors are perfect for there roles.",1251504000,2,249,4.555555555555555
2920117,2,B000UANYN0,"This movie is based on real life story, but does not tell the real story.  The whale was killed by a tug boat because he was not allowed the chance to reunite with his family.  The bad guys in this story actually are the ones that were able to reunite Springer (another orphaned killer whale) back to her pod, where she is still happy and healthy today. Luna died a needless  death due to an agenda that did not put what was best for this whale first.",1237248000,20,451,4.160919540229885
2920118,3,B000UANYN0,"When his father dies, Mike Maquinna (Adam Beach) returns to his tribe for the funeral.  The problem is, the band and his Mom (Tantoo Cardinal) expect him to stay and become Chief.  He left the reservation for good reasons--to get a job and to sober up.  He's not real sure he can come back.

Then, the whale shows up.  According to Bill (Graham Greene) the orca is the spirit of Mike's father.  Mike isn't sure, but he knows the tribe has to save the whale and possibly save it from the machinations of the Canadian fisheries Department.

This story is based on a true tale.  The acting is superlative, what can you say about Beach, Greene, and Cardinale that hasn't already been said?  The scenery is gorgeous, too.  The film was made in the Vancouver, BC area and no place is as gorgeous.  The movie is clearly made for television.  You can see the rough cuts between scenes, which is pretty distracting to the flow of the story.  In addition, teh soundtrack is a disappointment.  Plus, the music is occasionally overmodulated and too loud to know what is going on.

2920119,3,B000UANYN0,"If you are looking for a cinema masterpiece, this is not your DVD.  However, if you are looking for a good story about individualism vs. the needs of the community, read on.  Luna is a story about a man who is wrestling with what he wants and what his community needs.  Its cinematography is beautiful.  The acting is pretty basic, but the theme behind the story is well played.  I would recommend it for those who are trying to find a story about choosing the needs of the many over the hedonistic needs of the individual.  It is something suitable for the entire family.",1216425600,3,572,4.451923076923077
2920120,4,B000UANYN0,"I was surprised by this movie; it turned out to be much better than I expected.  I thought it would be just another 'animal rights' movie.  Instead, it really is about the Mowachaht/Muchalaht people on the west coast of Vancouver Island, and their traditional tribal beliefs about death.  In this case, a chief had recently passed away, and the tribe believed that his spirit came back in the form of a killer whale.  There are quite a few well-known First Nations actors in this movie as well.  So, while the title is named after the whale in question, it is more about the people affected by the whale's unusual behavior.

This movie is based on a real incident that we followed as it was happening.  [At the time we lived in 'Hollywood North,' Vancouver, BC.]  I think people who like nature or who are interested in various cultures will find this movie to be well worth watching.",1211760000,9,884,4.585987261146497
2920121,4,B000UANYN0,"Learn a little about the Vancouver Island Indian people by watching this film with your children. The photography is stunning, and the story line holds your attention. The film will appeal to environmentalists, wildlife enthusiasts, and to those who want to know about the culture of indigenous people.
We are using it in a film festival for those reasons.

2920126,3,B000UANYN0,"If you have ever seen the real story presented through the documentary The Whale, then you know why I rated this movie so-so.  It seems that the truth was better than fiction in this particular case.  Kudos for the great cast, and filming location, however.",1388620800,,257,4.688888888888889
2920127,5,B000UANYN0,Fantastic seller!  A must see!  Educational and inspiring.  I believe we need to fight for all whales and dolphins from a life in captivity.,1386460800,,140,4.75
2920128,5,B000UANYN0,"This is a great movie featuring Adam Beach in one of his ealier roles. There are a number of famous Native American actors featured in the film. The story line is average but made extraordinary by the inclusion of a killer whale. This is no Free Willie but it is a heartfelt story about spritualism, and believing in yourself, with a minimum of objectional content.",1385769600,,365,4.630769230769231

8212769,4,B000UANYN0,"I actually enjoyed "" the whale""  better - but bought them both so that is good.  This was a different point of view I enjoyed watching though.  What I would have given to meet this wonderful spirit - he seemed to love us more than we loved him ... kinda sad but the story melts my heart with love!",1413763200,,297,4.0
