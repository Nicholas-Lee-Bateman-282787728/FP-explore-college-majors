934596,4,6304747071,"this movie was really good, the action sequences have a nice flare to them that movies these days seem to lack. yeoh's martial arts skill and preformance make this a pretty enjoyable movie. I think this movie, Yes  madam, the tai chi master, and supercop show her in her top martial art  preformance.",958521600,12,300,4.6415094339622645
934597,5,6304747071,"Typical over-the-top, ""nothing suceeds like excess"" HK action thriller that works from the first scene to the last. Yeoh plays intrepid RHKPD Inspector Michelle Yip (who evidentally has her own special weapons  factory!), who finds herself entangled with deadly terrorists trying to  avenge the death of their comrades at her hands. She is aided by a Chinese  security expert and a Japanese cop, but it is really her movie. The fights  are bone-crushingly brutal, and the action scenes as a whole put similar  American fare to shame. Well-directed, slam-bang action!",932947200,6,566,5.2444444444444445

934668,5,6304747071,"I seen this movie 10 years ago, when it was on sale and popular among other titles from Tai Seng Video Marketing I use to buy their catalog book it has all the movies they sell etc.
A few years later I watch Yes Madam - Michelle Yeoh and it is way better than this movie - talking about the action not the boring parts.  I wish there was an english dubbed version of Yes Madam but its hard to find it.

This movie is a sequel to Yes Madam - aka Police Assassins.",1317686400,2,462,3.904255319148936
934669,4,6304747071,"When it comes to ROYAL WARRIORS (a.k.a. IN THE LINE OF DUTY) it most certainly is not about the straightforward plot or about Michael Wong whose nerve-grating character is named... Michael Wong. No, brother, ROYAL WARRIORS is all about the intense high-impact action, and so it's about Michelle Yeoh and it's a little bit about Japanese action star Hiroyuki Sanada. This film, released in Hong Kong in 1986, comes early in Michelle's acting career but, other than that she looks so much younger, you'd never know it. This ex-Miss Malaysia exudes that sort of presence. Her kung fu always could stand up to most men's kung fu. At least in cinema. Never mind that Michelle Yeoh never did have any formal training in the martial arts and that she had to pick things up here and there as she progressed from movie to movie.

The plot to this police thriller isn't what you'd call serpentine. Basically, a Hong Kong police inspector (Yeoh), a Japanese Interpol agent (Sanada), and a vapid sky marshal (Wong) foil an airplane hijacking and, in the process, end up killing the hijackers. But these hijackers have loyal associates (which is sweet and cuddly in a homicidal kind of way), and so the rest of the film finds our three protagonists being tracked and hunted by revenge-minded folks.

Some telltale signs that this movie was made in the 1980s era. There's the cheesy film score, of course. And, in her opening scene, a happy-go-lucky Michelle is wardrobed a bit like Sonny Crockett, although you forget about that once she goes into action, gracefully, cheerfully taking out a bunch of hooligans chasing some ex-gang member.

Points get taken away for that shady-looking ""prototype"" armored vehicle Michelle finds under some rock for the final showdown. And they never do go over how the weapons (which includes a grenade) get past Hong Kong airport security for the hijacking. They weren't just screening for nunchuks, were they?

Michael Wong's participation brings down the movie, and maybe someone fooled him into thinking this was a romantic comedy. His constant hitting on Michelle is brutal, his big go-to move seems to be this relentless showering of flowers on Michelle. And then he can't even really hold up his end in the action sequences. Michael Wong is basically playing the gender-reversed dude in distress role.

Thank goodness that the film's bonehead moves are countered by Michelle Yeoh and Hiroyuki Sanada's presence, although it's not really about Hiroyuki Sanada. The man has got some great power moves and he does have this brooding thing going on. But ROYAL WARRIORS is clearly a platform for Michelle. Michelle Yeoh, who is as game as they come, is featured in most of the fight scenes and while she doles out massive punishment with some really wicked moves, she also takes her share of pummeling. It's her doing all the crashing into walls and absorbing the kicks and punches and no wonder she's hailed as the world's top action film heroine. Her climactic fight with the last bad guy in that battered tool shed is astonishingly brutal.

The film benefits from having killers so ruthless that their actions can't help but directly impact Michelle's nature as she goes from carefree to murderously bleak. Plenty of innocent bystanders bite the bullet. The villains are pretty indiscriminate about collateral damage. The final killer is so over-the-top bent that he tortures a guy even after his death. I mean, he digs him up from his grave! That's some pretty sick stuff. To deal with someone so warped, a police inspector would probably have to give up her gun and badge...

This DVD also comes with the original movie trailer (which tends to give away the entire plot) and a new and more dynamic movie trailer.",1278115200,,3740,4.898894154818326

934674,5,6304747071,"ROYAL WARRIORS is simply one of the best action movies ever made.  It features the bone-crunchingly brutal style of Hong Kong choreography that was perfected in the 80's following the renaissance initiated by Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan, and it has rarely looked better than it does in this movie.  This is text book action cinema, and Michelle Yeoh is remarkable.",1043539200,20,363,4.934426229508197
934675,5,6304747071,"Wow...the martial arts in this movie really surprised me considering how raw and brutal some of the scenes were. Great movie with a great story. For those that don't know, this is the second installment of the In The Line of Duty series...I highly suggest checking out In The Line of Duty IV...but RW is awesome in terms of martial arts, you can expect a really brutal michelle yeoh in this one...story centers around michelle yeoh as a police officer along with a japanese police officer and an annoying security guard who prevents a plane from being hijacked by terrorists for the purpose of freeing a convict. They killed all the terrorists along with the convict, but then the convict's 3 best War buddies plot a revenge on the 3 individuals, and the rest of the movie is about pure survival...there are many dramatic parts in the film, but you'll be rooting for michelle all the way...definitely one of her best...",1007510400,16,919,4.714285714285714
7878344,4,6304747071,"Michelle Yeoh, supported by Michael Wong and Hiro Sanada, kicks her way through a rather standard plot, distinguished by jaw-dropping fight choreography and stunts. The requisite 80s gunplay is interspersed nicely with the martial arts and property destruction, resulting in a satisfying Hong Kong classic.",1516579200,,306,5.822222222222222
7878345,4,6304747071,"""fraid I didn't watch this all the way thru. Not my kind of film but I really like Michelle Yeoh so I had to see what she did in this movie.  Of course there is lots of action.  I'm certainly no expert but the fights looked great to me.  Wonderful car crashes too. I think this would great fun for kids and adults who are into martial arts.",1514592000,,340,3.9705882352941178
7878346,5,6304747071,"The cinematography in this film is great for its time, and the way the director cut the shots was definitely different than your average Chinese martial arts flick. I enjoyed picking up on the details in this film from the way the director chose to cut the shots to the finer details like the set, clothing, props, and demeanor of the characters which made this film look so polished in comparison to other films of its kind in the 80s that I've seen. I was also amazed at the quality of the picture (while certainly being nothing compared to today's HD standards) compared to the often very grainy Chinese martial arts films also shot in the 80s.

In scenes like the restaurant/night club the colorfulness of the set really stood out. I happened to pause at an action moment with the neon lights in the background painting an actors face, which really made me notice this. And the set design (those maze-looking aquariums looked pretty cool and unique, to note just one thing) was well thought-out too I thought.

Also, somehow, while intentionally including a very goofy character for comic effect and having occasional cheesy moments (someone rightly noted the ridiculous armored car at the end) this film pulled off having fairly serious and sober characters without being cartoonish. I thought that even characters with less screen time like the police chief were realistically portrayed. I enjoyed the story, action, and the occasional suspense. This is one of the best older martial arts films I've seen.",1513900800,,1511,4.8984375
7878347,5,6304747071,"This movie is in Cantonese with auto English subtitles.  Excellent performance by Michelle Yeoh as her fight scenes are always well choreographed.  The story is decent.  Four guys who met in a war became best brothers when they saved each other.  However, they all became mobsters.  What happens to one is protected by all.  So when one of the brothers is arrested in Japan and is extradited to Hong Kong (HK) on a plane escorted by one Japanese officer and several HK officers including Michelle Yeoh, one of the brothers come onto the plane during flight to do a rescue attempt  Cool fight scene on the plane, and of course the rescue attempt failed.  So, then came other attempts that turn into revenge.  The good vs. the bad, and next thing you know people are killed left and right.  There are some romantic humor in the movie which at times helped lightened up the story instead of all just fights and guns.",1508371200,,913,4.580246913580247

7878351,4,6304747071,"Michelle Yeoh is young, beautiful, and very dangerous in this action movie, which was made early in her career. She plays a Hong Kong police officer who, along with two other officers, is being targeted by a terrorist group in a revenge scheme. This story is nothing new, of course, but as it progresses, you begin to see both the cops and the villains are acting out of the same motivation (avenging those they love) which adds a layer of substance to an idea thats already well-worn. This angle is not explored very deeply, though.

The real reason to see this is the ferocious stunts and action, which are impressive. The bloodshed is very high at times so be warned.
