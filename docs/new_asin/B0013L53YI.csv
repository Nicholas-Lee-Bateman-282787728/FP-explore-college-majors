8251676,5,B0013L53YI,"This is the 1st title won by Wayne Rainey. One of three in a row. The legendary champion wins with a couple races left. You get to see the battle between Rainey,Schwantz,Lawson,Doohan and Gardner. This season was a breakout year for Doohan who finished third. Lawson and Gardner have accidents which take them out of the title early in the season. Be sure to buy it off Amazon instead of from Duke. Duke has a terrible customer service which doesn't answer your e-mails or phone calls. This DVD is well worth the watch. It has 4 time champ Lawson. One time champs Gardner and Schwantz and 5 time to be champ Mick Doohan. There is a great biography of Wayne Rainey available on Amazon.",1308960000,,684,4.524193548387097

WITH THAT SAID THIS DVD IS VERY WELL PUT TOGEATHER, GREAT FOOTAGE OF EACH RACE, AND SOME OF THE GREATEST RACERS EVER IN WHAYNE RAINEY, KEVIN SCHWANTZ, MICK DOOHAN, EDDIE LAWSON, AND WHAYNE GARDNER JUST TO NAME A FEW. THE ONLY FOOTAGE I'VE EVEER SEEN OF THESE RACERS ASIDE FROM YOUTUBE CLIPS WAS ON ""FASTER"" AND I FEEL LIKE THEY DON'T GIVE RAINEY THE CREDIT HE DESERVES. THE MAN RIDES HARD! AND REMINDS ME OF DANI PEDROSA, KEVIN SCHWANTZ IS QUITE THE CHARACTER, BE SHORE TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM WHEN CELEBRATING.THIS RACING IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE RACING TODAY IF NOT BETTER. I RECCOMEND THIS FOR ANY RACING FAN....5 STARS

PS.DID I MENTION THE SCHWANTZ-RAINEY BATTLES....THEY'RE LEGENDARY FOR A REASON",1258675200,3,842,4.432258064516129
