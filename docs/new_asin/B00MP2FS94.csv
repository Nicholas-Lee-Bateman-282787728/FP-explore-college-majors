6598139,5,B00MP2FS94,One of the few animes that made me laugh out loud!! Definitely worth watching!!!,1422403200,,80,4.785714285714286
6598140,5,B00MP2FS94,I love the anime so muc that I wish that they had come out with a session 2. This iteam is great quality and has both blue ray and DVDs. Very happy with my buy :),1420588800,,162,3.5277777777777777
6598141,5,B00MP2FS94,I loved this series. I wish it was longer. It's a great and funny storyline,1420243200,,75,4.066666666666666
6598142,5,B00MP2FS94,"What can I say about this series?  Well first how it got five stars.

Star one was for animation quality.  Quality of the animation is very good and the Blue rays are great.
Star two was for voice acting.  I watched it in Dubbed and enjoyed the funny voice acting.
Star three was for plot.  It has a basic plot and the character works toward it, but there is a moral hiding in there.
Star four was for price.  For less than 14$ its a great deal to get both DVD and Blueray.
Star five was for entertainment value.  It was quick paced, funny and entertaining.

This is one of the few anime that I have seen where they give the leading role to a girl and actually make it work.  I found the series super funny and entertaining.  It was well worth buying and has good re-watch ability.  Yamada's character, as well as the rest do develop and change, but the plot never really changes.

CONTENT:  FAN SERVICE, FOUL LANGUAGE AND PARTIAL NUDITY.

SPOILER:

Yamada's First Time won't be winning any prizes for plot, instead it focuses on a simple one throughout.  There are no alien invaders or complicated subplots, it just one girl who wanted to get some.  Yamada is the prettiest girl at school, but she has a goal of sleeping with 100 guys.  The only thing holding her back is her embarrassment about her own virginity.  She turns down any guy she thinks might have more experience with sex than she does.  She is also pretty vain and self-serving.  Her character develops when she meets her very own cherry boy and decides to get hands on experience.  She starts off OVERLY aggressive and soon discovers that its not working so she changes her strategy slightly.  Her sheer aggressive nature makes for most of the funniest parts of the anime.  Its all about getting her virginity taken at first, but the more time she spends with her cherry boy the more it seems like she is falling in love.  By the end of the series she still wants to have sex but only with him.",1416355200,33,1961,4.410614525139665
6598143,5,B00MP2FS94,"I've pre-ordered a copy of this after watching the first few episodes. I gotta say this anime is actually pretty funny. At first I stayed away from it because the story plot seemed really weird to me, but one day I was bored and decided to watch it. Turns out that it's actually good. I recommend this to anyone who likes romantic comedies.",1414454400,7,340,4.412698412698413

6598145,5,B00MP2FS94,"Yamata is considered one of the prettiest and most popular girls in school.  And she would love to climb the tower and sleep with 100 boys, however there is a small problem.  She is still a cherry girl and has NO experience with a boy.  So what happens is one day she runs into the most unassuming classmate, and she decides to make him her ""first"".  Can she finally get started on the road to her dream, or perhaps is the first going to be her only.

Do not take this series seriously  No major nudity, but there is a lot of adult themed action, quite a few mess ups, and of course - a lot of interruptions.  Watching not only their actions, but also Yamata with her best friend and her inner goddess.  Was a good series, and should be watched",1408924800,15,744,4.190140845070423

6598202,5,B00MP2FS94,"This is one of those series you stumble across almost by accident and fall in love. It's an adorable tale of a young girl who only thinks about sex. But every journey begins with a first step. And she hasn't taken hers yet. Searching for an inexperienced guy, she finds the perfect 'Cherry' Boy (virgin) and she goes after his V-Card. But things take a turn when she starts falling for him.

This story follows their awkward journey. It kept me smiling or laughing out loud through-out. I highly recommend this.",1494374400,,511,4.615384615384615
6598203,3,B00MP2FS94,"well if it's going to talk about like ""banging 100 guys"" and panties and risque things, it should actually show it as well. theres so many opportunities for a panty shot but they never draw panty shots or anything really.
I'd say this is not a very serious anime and it doesn't make up with it with fan service or anything. I'd choose something else.

it's kinda cute in some parts but I was expecting more.",1491782400,,407,4.355263157894737

6598251,4,B00MP2FS94,"This is one of the oddest surprises in anime that I have ever run across.  On the surface, at the beginning this appears to be the story of a sex-obsessed, beautiful young predator, the infamous Yamada, relentlessly setting out upon her personal high school quest to have sex with 100 guys,... but it turns out that she's a virgin with enough complications to fill a book, the despair of her less inexperienced but FAR more normal best friend, Miharu Takeshita, and her virginal but FAR more rational little sister, Chika, who have to put up with her craziness.  As a ""solution"" to her ""problem"", Yamada hits upon the idea of selecting (and seducing) a ""plain and ordinary"", relatively clueless, virgin Takashi Kosuda as her first conquest, but thanks to an avalanche of problems, including her own near psychotic indecisiveness, sex is indefinitely delayed while love begins and grows.  All this comes with hilarious side jokes out the wazoo.

The problem?  The creators didn't have a stopping point.  The best illustration of this is the relative position of the heroine.  At the start of the series, to the despair of her BFF and her little sister who try to rein her in, Yamada is the craziest character in the show; by the halfway point, without much change on Yamada's part, she is the sanest of the lust crazed loonies by far.  Even with the excellent humor that will take some getting used to.",1477267200,2,1401,4.760330578512397
6598272,5,B00MP2FS94,I do love this because I find it to be very funny. I love how she has this goal but she is too shy to really do anything about it. I also like how she is a cherry and is looking for a cherry boy for her first time.,1475452800,,214,3.3877551020408165
6598273,4,B00MP2FS94,"Mildly amusing premise for a romance anime, Yamada enters HS with the plan to seduce 100 boys though she herself is 'inexperienced' in love.  Her first target proves to be somewhat dense, cumbersome and slow in Kosuda who's just along for the ride until they both develop real feeling for each other.",1475280000,,300,4.769230769230769
6598274,5,B00MP2FS94,"Amazing series with an amazing voice cast. The plot line is also adorable and the somewhat ecchi scenes are not forced upon like most animes these days, a solid 8/10. And the price cant be beat!",1474934400,,194,4.416666666666667
6598275,5,B00MP2FS94,"This is a review of the DVD and Case. I am a Fan of the Show so I will not review here. I will say this Anime is NOT for Children! If you are looking to Purchase B Gata H Kei: This is a good buy. There are Disks printed with basic graphics. The case is a standard DVD case that holds 2 dvds on each sleeve. There are center tabs that hold the DVD's secure. Mine did not skip and all played well. No additional booklets or information. This is a case. A double sided print cover. So you get a couple extra pictures and info on the inside of the case. Blue - blue-ray see through case. The discs, Cases and printing is the same as I would expect if I had purchased at a store front.  This is 4 Discs, in English Dub or Japanese with English sub. Plays well on my Blue ray.

This is a S.A.V.E combo pack. If you just want to own the DVD's with out all the extras. This is exactly what your looking for.",1473811200,3,899,3.907103825136612

6598280,5,B00MP2FS94,"This DVD/Blu-ray combo (and many other S.A.V.E anime DVD's) has a special surprise inside. Read on, and I will reveal a little secret.

I purchased this series on a whim without knowing anything about it and little of the genre. I was skeptical at first, but I'm sure glad I pulled through and bought it.

This series is really funny and silly. I was laughing out loud at the sex puns and jokes. The nudity is relatively mild and not as frequent as I suspected. The animation quality is high and the English dub is really good. It is fun to watch and I would go back to episodes for funny dialogues. This show is great for anyone who can enjoy dirty jokes and sex humor.

Oh, anyone with children and young teens may want to keep this flick out of reach. It's not rated, but I personally wouldn't allow anyone younger than 17 or 18 to view this.

OK! For that special little secret you have been waiting for now!

Some people don't like that somewhat tacky lime green saver stripe on edge of the cover and side strip. If you want a clean full sized cover on the case, simply pull out (with care) the sleeve and turn it over. The clean art will now be the cover. The lime green will be seen only when you open the DVD case. This applied to many of the anime S.A.V.E series I have bought.

Buy this if you need a good laugh at a great price!",1464566400,26,1339,4.190661478599222

6598307,4,B00MP2FS94,"This was a nice, and entertaining show. I first expected it to be a rated R type of show, lots of flashes, and questionable situations, but in the end, it was not like that at all. (no, I did not buy it for that either, but some of the best shows are like that.. look at tenchi muyo for example) While there was a few, it was not anywhere near as bad on the adult stuff as I expected. I bought it thinking that it would be entertaining on the, inopportune timing, type of thing. Meaning, she would try something and you know someone will always come in at the wrong time.. That sort of thing. That and humorous situations as she tries things that never come out quite right.. Asking guys out, etc. In that aspect, this show did not disappoint, so it was kind of what I expected, with just will a lot less nudity. Which was fine with me. By the way that they marketed it, I also expected her to be a lot more forward too. In the end, I would say because of the adult humor in it, it should be rated R, but outside of that, I would go with PG-13. Basically, it is typical teenager stuff in it.

I am not going to go into the details about the show because that can be read just about anywhere, and if you are reading the comments, you already have an idea what the show is about. Overall, it is a good show, but don't expect any kind of great, award winning humor, just a good fun show.",1454630400,8,1384,4.069597069597069
6598308,4,B00MP2FS94,Used to see this back when Funimation Channel was still Funimatiion now it's TOKU.  Anyway I thought the show was hilarious for I mean you only see a sister loving her brother in Anime because American cartoons really can't do that like a lot of things they can't do that Anime can.  It's a very wacky love comedy set in high school recommended for Anime fans though mostly used to that stuff.,1453075200,,393,4.444444444444445

6598328,5,B00MP2FS94,"One of my favorite anime, currently in my top 25.  The beginning is a bit slow, but after a while Yamada's forced romance with her ""cherry boy,"" Kosuda, who she randomly picks for his mediocre looks (because he's the perfect, safe bet for losing her virginity, since ""he is definitely a virgin,"" in her words) begins to shape into real romance, with that awkward bit of teenage insecurity and drama thrown in.

Obviously not every moment of this anime is completely realistic, and there are more than a few cliches, but it's definitely different from all the other ""fanservice"" anime I've seen in the past.  The situations surrounding the main characters may not be likely, but their reactions to these situations are believable, both in the context of their characters and in the context of real life.  I found myself saying, ""Yeah, that's happened to me before"" more than once.  I would also put its humor on the level of ""Girls Bravo,"" which I initially didn't enjoy, but found funny after watching more of the series.  Both these series are similar in that respect, as many of my friends did not enjoy this anime after only seeing the first episode, but enjoyed ""Girls Bravo.""  It also manages to stave off a stagnant story with funny situations, well-executed cliches, and interesting characters.

Possible Spoilers:
""Yamada's First Time"" is about Yamada, a teenage girl just starting high school, and her quest to sleep with 100 men.  I did not find this concept ridiculous mainly because Yamada is a vain character, and likely she would derive much self-worth from the completion of this goal.  Though it is disturbing, for better or worse it's also a funny plot point, and provides the viewer with a sense of contented relief when Yamada (perhaps not consciously) realizes that this goal is neither realistic nor in her best interest (I will explain the latter momentarily).  This show has a realistic development of both of their characters (Yamada and Kosuda); with Yamada realizing she truly likes Kosuda, and Kosuda slowly developing complex feelings for Yamada beyond his lust for her appearance, which is a shy and uncertain part of his character.  As they learn more about one another, they begin to understand each other, and also begin to see one another as more than just the sum of their parts.  This anime currently has one season, but if it were to have a second season I have no doubt it could achieve popularity in not only its genre but in the world of anime as a whole.",1443744000,2,2494,4.785547785547785

6598352,5,B00MP2FS94,This series is one of the funniest I've seen in a long time. I think the premise is absolutely unbelievable so the individual plot lines can really venture into the ridiculous. One of my new favorite animes. Its great that the little sister and best friend realize how insane Yamada is. I think that really helps the viewer to know that no one should take this girl or this series too seriously.,1430438400,,395,4.5
6598353,2,B00MP2FS94,"This is my 4/10 mangaupdates review for the manga: The anime adapts most of it and goes of script towards the end while skipping some of the trashier parts so you can add 1/10 if you want or not:
The 4-koma format puts a narrative and the comedic timing into way too artificial borders so it shouldn't be uses in a long form tale but this series fails as is it represents 9 full volumes of warmed up nothing. The leads are all just boring tropes as they include a tsundere protagonist, the clumsy but lucky love interest who constantly catches the lead in various stages of undress, the sheltered rich girl as a ""rival"" (who is even in love with her perfect brother), the cooler sibling and... Yamada further constantly monologues how she wants to have sex with at least a 100 boys, can't stop to masturbating at school and so on but then can't even get the one guy into her panties who is heads over heels for her for nearly 3 full years. I can only repeat that it takes the main couple, who are the only characters who get a plot, the entirety of their high school career to actually do something and the manga just ends with a graduation thereafter. What sort of sex focused rom-com would pull such a stunt and all the jokes present are the same ones you will find in all the other equally lame siblings. Look this series may be better than the author's previous trashy hentai but if this can't work as a comedy, romance or a porno then why down it exist again? The award winning and also animated Ping Pong Club (7,5/10), the satirical Jigokuren (8/10) and the out of control The Penisman by Sui ""Tokyo Ghoul"" Ishida (8/10) all prove that japanese sex comedies have no excuses to suck or put you to sleep and if you want to read a highly explicit romance that cares to tell a story thicker then the paper it is printed on then go for Natsu no Zenjitsu (9/10), a 17+ comic by Image or Yanagida-kun to Mizuno-san (6/10) which is a ""real"" tsundere porno. The last one may suffer from the usual hentai problems but it accomplishes WAY more in 1/4 of the page count and i lastly gave up on Yoko's new 4-koma ecchi comedy (how original) after barely 2 chapters.",1429660800,3,2159,4.359801488833747

Sure, some parts were a bit graphic and it certainly isn't for kids, but I laughed from the first episode to the last and it opened up a whole different genre of anime for me.",1429574400,,283,4.3584905660377355

6598360,2,B00MP2FS94,"I've seen my share of harem ecchi including more lowbrow anime series like Desert Punk. Never before have I been unable to continue watching a series out of hatred of a character.

The artwork and storyline (through what I've seen in the first disc) are as expected from an ecchi series with crude humor and fanservice.  This isn't the issue. The back and forth awkwardness in the harem is expected, but Yamada is an ugly example of a self-absorbed person willing to use a nice person for whatever she wants when they did nothing to deserve it.  I've yet to see another harem ecchi contain this aspect where someone in the harem is used like this.  Even in the Zero No Tsukaima series where Saito is berated in a similar fashion, it's not as bad because he isn't just a pawn in some female's plan.  Saito is Louise's familiar, her servant and assistant (even though they do have feelings for one another).  It's still different from Yamada's First Time where Yamada constantly puts down Kosuda, gives him the cold shoulder, and is a general jerk all while trying to use him for her own scheme. The poor guy is left confused and doesn't know if he should continue pursuing a relationship with her or not.

Though I can say I love series like Desert Punk, the dynamic is night and day between its characters even though Desert Punk would be considered a far worse person than Yamada by most.  In Desert Punk he is one of the biggest jerks around, but he is used by everyone around him as well and gets what he deserves.  Yamada, on the other hand, chooses to prey on the one genuine person that does nothing wrong to her.  She plans on using 100 people strictly for premarital relations, like pawns.  Desert punk isn't walking around keeping a tally of how many people he can use for some arbitrary goal.

I suppose if I were a selfish female in today's society and I didn't have a problem with manipulating nice people for my own gain, then I would find it hilarious to use and abuse other people's generosity for my own gain.  Unfortunately for Yamada's First Time, I have a conscience and like to treat people with respect and equality.  I'm sure if an anime had the same premise as Yamada's First Time but in stead with a male front runner that had a goal of reaching 100 intimate partners while using people like pawns, it wouldn't be quite as well received, to say the least.",1422835200,5,2379,4.489559164733179

I was nervous my family would think weird of me because I watched this but it was very funny, very well made, and didn't let its fan service vibe complete ruin the story.",1524528000,,303,4.1525423728813555
8673682,1,B00MP2FS94,"Bought this because it was on sale for under 10 dollars. Frankly after only viewing the first episode it made me uncomfortable and unwilling to watch the rest. Rest assured that I am not a prude or anything of the sort ( I like Senran Kagura, DOA series, Gal Gun, and such.) If you want to feel like a total creep then by all means go for this... Watch something like Konosuba or Spice and Wolf instead. Good day folks!",1524009600,,419,4.25

It's not what I was expecting, it was actually more than I was expecting. The awkward relationship that developed between the main characters is funny and typical of high school romance. I really enjoyed it despite not having high hopes.",1518998400,,351,4.966101694915254

I just got dine watching the blue ray copy and my only complaint is that there we're some blips in it, but it barley lasted a fraction of a second so they didn't bother me that much. It is pretty disappointing considering this happened the first time I played them and I bought it new, but I'm glad to have it in my collection none the less!",1512172800,,481,4.239130434782608
