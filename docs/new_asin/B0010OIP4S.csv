3700499,4,B0010OIP4S,"I loved the new version -- except I feel that they cut way too much material. I'm guessing BBC concentrates on one major period drama in a given year, and remakes several other ""short"" versions of other works. Case in point: Jane Austen's works done in 2008: 1 substantial (Sense & Sensibility) and other very lacking works (Mansfield Park, etc.). That's too bad.",1244851200,11,363,4.777777777777778
3700500,1,B0010OIP4S,"The product description above should read, ""VERY, VERY LOOSELY based on Dickens' classic novel.""  Almost everything about this production is wrong and the screenwriter and director should be ashamed of themselves; they have done a terrible disservice to those of us who love the novel and to those who have not yet read it and will mistakenly believe that this DVD tells its story.  The worst crime commited by those involved in this travesty is the creation of a ""happy ending"" to make our hearts ache a little less. What idiotic rubbish!  Please, spend your money on a copy of the book, read it, and cry your eyes out; as Dickens intended you to do.",1242000000,64,651,4.643478260869565

3700502,4,B0010OIP4S,"I found The Old Curiosity Shop by Charles Dickens well acted, and I enjoyed the story; I didn't care for the ending however.  It is rather long, so it is a good movie for a rainy afternoon.

As I enjoy fantasies, I also enjoyed the Voyage of the Unicorn. It wasn't overly violent, had no bad language, and was sprinkled with humor. A father and his two daughters thrown into a fantasy world while trying to put their lives back together after the death of his wife and their mother.",1216166400,3,482,4.344444444444444
3700503,5,B0010OIP4S,"I was surprised that I liked this version.  I couldn't see Derek Jacobi in his role.  I should have known better.  He was magnificent!!  MUCH, MUCH, MUCH better than Peter Ustinov.  Toby Jones also made a much better Mr. Quilp!",1436054400,3,227,4.575

3700505,4,B0010OIP4S,A heartwarming adaptation with superior actors. It both warmed and broke my heart.,1409529600,,82,5.384615384615385
3700506,1,B0010OIP4S,"I was very disappointed in this movie. First of all, do not expect this movie to follow the book. Great liberties have been taken with the story and the ending has been completely altered. Major characters in the book are missing in this movie and the overall effect leaves you with a meaningless, empty story that is rushed from the beginning to the end. Character development is nonexistent. Read the book and skip this movie.",1391904000,,428,4.72
3700507,4,B0010OIP4S,"...has a terrible ending.  Dickens likes to show the seamy side of old England, but he usually comes up with some sort of ending that is pleasing for someone.  Not here.",1379116800,,169,4.419354838709677
3700508,5,B0010OIP4S,"You know how they say that the sins of the parents are visited on the children?  Well, here it's the sins of a grandparent visited on the grandchild.  I swear, some of these characters in these films will make you want to break them in half!  But again, a very good film and also worth the money.  5 stars.",1365811200,,306,4.135593220338983
3700509,5,B0010OIP4S,"What I like best about the Old Curiosity Shop was what the author himself did.  When this was written, it was issued in serial numbers, meaning Dickens would issue chapters at a time, such as 1-3, 4-6, and so on.  As he progressed in the story, people became enamored of ""Poor Little Nell"" and what would happen to her.  The Inimitable (Dickens) had gotten wind of this, and simply decided enough was enough, and he'd rather write something else.  People pleaded with him to have her live, including Charles Dickens's own mother, but he'd simply had enough.  A great adaptation as it aired here in the U.S. on PBS.  Happy 200th Mr. Dickens!",1356134400,,640,4.619469026548672
3700510,1,B0010OIP4S,"I strongly suspect Charles Dickens would be disappointed too. This film really let me down. It takes far too many liberties with the plot. The story has been changed so much in this film that it may as well carry some other title. Toby Jones does a superb job, but everyone else leaves you longing for better talent.",1344470400,5,316,4.4655172413793105
3700511,1,B0010OIP4S,"It's a shame to do this to Dickens and to pour great talent into a wasted effort. This just aired again recenly. ""Butchery"" is the word that first comes to mind.

The Shop has never been considered one of Dickens best but it does have his usual cast of characters, plot twists, and tugs on your emotions (in this case an extra dose of bathos in the form of Nell).

The bathos is about all you get in this condensed version, as you might guess by the running time. Dickens's stories need time to unfold and isn't that leisurely unfolding of a tale what we expect from MPT productions?  We've been robbed.  The movie follows (err, rushes through . . .) the middle path of the story line, with enough substance to build the main characters and never mind anything else -- what is the story of Nell's father? Who was the guy with the parrot that took up one whole shot unexplained and was never seen or hinted at again?

It's not that you can't watch and enjoy this. Derek Jacobi, Toby Jones and Zo Wanamaker are always a pleasure to watch.  But if what you like about Dickens (or most any writer, for that matter) are the layers of the story, and what you want is a masterful presentation of that story, you'll find this falls very short of your expectations, even if they are not great.",1330646400,6,1284,4.351464435146443
3700512,1,B0010OIP4S,"A friend of mine told me they are going to be showing this again on PBS.  Don't waste your time.  After a very good Bleak House, I thought that ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" would be wonderful also.  It was not; Nell was miscast (the actress was far too old), the ending was changed, characters were unrecognizable from the book, in short, the whole thing was a thrown together mess.  If you just read one chapter from the book, you will do yourself more good than sitting through this production.",1329609600,6,492,4.49438202247191
3700513,3,B0010OIP4S,"I do love Charles Dickens.  I think he was a genius, a remarkable writer.  However, This story is so very sad.  It does show the period and the poverty in 19th century England but it ends so sadly.  It is a good movie but is very sad.",1319932800,,234,3.9148936170212765
3700514,2,B0010OIP4S,"Let me first say I am a fan of Dickens and a fan of BBC productions like this.  Although I haven't read The Old Curiosity Shop, this DVD version was enough to convince me to skip the book.  Even compared to other Dickens' works, the story here is overly dark, morbid and depressing.  As for the production, the cinematography was fine as well as the casting.  Unfortunately, there was not enough character development to make me care or sympathize with the main characters as they experienced tragedy after tragedy at the hands of a very creepy villain.  The end came as a relief.  Recommend you skip this one--maybe the book was better.",1316217600,,637,4.642857142857143
3700515,3,B0010OIP4S,"ITV's new adaptation of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" centers on the heroine Nell Trent living with her grandfather. They are forced to flee his Old Curiosity Shop, however, when the gambling grandfather (who thinks he is doing that for her loving granddaughter) is heavily in debt to Daniel Quilp, who, it is suggested, wants not just the shop, but something else. While Quilp chases them, a mysterious lodger at the attorney Samson Brass's is also looking for the missing daughter.

Considering the meandering nature of the storytelling in Victorian novels, ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" (2007) is surprisingly faithful to the original book of Charles Dickens (published in book form in 1841). That is a good thing, to be sure, but there is something missing in the new adaptation, something like sense of humor.

Sophie Vavasseur (""Becoming Jane"") plays the heroine Nell Trent (or ""Little Nell"") though she seems much older than she should be. Almost adult, I would say, which makes her suffering less poignant. Toby Jones (""Infamous"") as Daniel Quilp is not very convincing, either, compared with Tom Courtenay in the 1995 adaptation. He makes the role too serious, and his turn as the ""villain"" lacks the Dickensian humor, which is essential to some of the comic scenes of the novel, including the famous line about his ""Aquiline"" nose.

Supporting actors fare much better. Adam Godley as Sampson Brass, Zo Wanamaker as Mrs. Jarley and Charlene McKenna as ""The Marchioness"" are all very good, giving subtle nuances to roles that could easily become caricatures. The production designs and the photography are all respectable.

This is not a bad adaptation, but I am not still sure why they had to make another film based on this book.

(According to IMDb, the film's running time is 120 minutes, but my DVD copy from BBC America says its feature length is ""approximately 93 minutes."")",1296086400,10,1879,5.009615384615385
3700516,2,B0010OIP4S,"I have not read the Dickens original but I suspect that this is not a very satisfactory dramatization. Parts seem to go very slowly and other parts seem rushed. The story also is rather humdrum Dickens: incredibly angelic people and utterly despicable ones. The baddies come to a bad end, and usually the sweet and innocent ones find happiness at the end. In this case, Little Nell, who is sweetness itself, dies, so there is an unexpected twist there. The actress who plays her suffers from the ""BBC affliction"": she doesn't speak words much of the time but makes little mousy noises to show how sweet and demure she is. As a result you need to subtitles to know what she is saying. Happily, there are subtitles without which much of the DVD would not be intelligible. I like Dickens, but I got bored watching this one third of the way through and hurried through the subsequent scenes to get to the end. I may go back when I muster the patience to do so and watch it all the way through.",1276214400,2,989,4.43956043956044
3700517,5,B0010OIP4S,"Fast Shipping, Took 3 days from time of purchase. I love a bunch of Dickens movies, but this is in the top five with Little Dorrit, Oliver Twist, and David Copperfield. All of the aforementioned movies were produced by the BBC within the past 10 years. Although, many of them were made in the 70's and 80's as well. The new versions show so much historical accuracy. If it weren't for the terrible medical care available and the pollution in the air from coal fires, I would love to live in 19th century England, maybe not London though. I wish Americans would start to speak the way they did in those days.

I would recommend this movie to anyone that loves this time period in England. The historical accuracy makes you feel like you are actually in this time period. Just light a bunch of candles, start a fire in the fireplace, and there you go.",1265414400,3,849,4.4423076923076925
3700518,3,B0010OIP4S,"My husband and I did not think this particular version of ""The Old Curiosity Shop"" was too worthwhile.  The film was dark and hard to see and some of the acting was not to our liking.  Just our opinion.",1257206400,6,202,4.153846153846154
3700519,2,B0010OIP4S,"The other 1994-version (4-stars) with Peter Ustinov as the grandfather is more lively. The villain in the 1994-version steals the show. You hate the villain, he annoys you, he reminds you of someone you know, and he is hot on the trail of Nell and her grandfather. You do not like the villain in this version either, but you are not yelling at the TV, and you do not feel his pursuit.

Each version has something the other versions are missing. This version does a better job with Mr. Swiveller and the little maid.

I am comparing this 2007-version to the 1994-version. Compared to TV today, this version is 3 or 4 stars. If you have not seen the 1994-version; you will probably like this OK.

I would take the characters and plot and re-write a moral to the story in any version and the book, re-write Nell and her grandfather just a little for a feel-good story. ""Oliver Twist"", ""David Copperfield"", and ""A Christmas Carol"" are perfect. This story has colorful-characters and promising-plot that needs to be changed just a little. You cannot re-write the Bible, but, as great as Dickens was; you can re-write Dickens. This story needed a little something. I go into more detail in my 4-star review of the other, 1994-version, under the comment-button there.

This version is better than the 1979-version. (I have seen all three versions).",1254700800,4,1341,4.742489270386266
3700520,4,B0010OIP4S,"I am a huge fan of Charles Dickens, but this is not one of my favorite novels of his.

8321966,1,B0010OIP4S,"I actually would give this movie a -5 stars, but you have to put @ least one up there. This movie was so sad and evil. It made me sick how cruel people can be and how an uncle could torture his niece the way he did. This movie was not just dark, it was from hell. It made my skin crawl. I didn't even want this movie in my house, so I sent it back. It will never be in my Charles Dickens collection!!!",1525564800,,401,3.7294117647058824
