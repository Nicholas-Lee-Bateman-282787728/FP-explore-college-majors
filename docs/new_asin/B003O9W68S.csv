I liked the movie but thought: "" the French or the Spaniards can take this idea and make it unapologetic and better"". Well, Castillos de Carton did just that. I can write a 10 page review to talk about this great film. However, I have a life and thus will not. What I will say is that if you enjoy a good film that deals with unapologetic sexuality and the art that sexuality brings to our lives this one is for you.  TWO BIG THUPMS UP!!!!!",1298592000,11,546,4.2
8401500,4,B003O9W68S,"I watched this movie on Sundance Channel. It is a story about three art students who are in love with the same girl. The action takes place in some big city in Spain in our time. It could be late 1980, because no cell phones are visible. Very well done film. A lot of sexual activities between three shown to great details. If you are a painter then you will pick up something from this movie. Very nice young actors. It is not a porno flick, but to some folks it could be. Just remember yourself, when you were of their age in college. Have you share the same girl with love and caress?
I would like to buy it, but amazon does not have it in US format and seems to be expenssive. I will wait until all these conditions will come to common sense.
 Will wait for the Sundance Channel to show it again.",1293148800,11,800,4.128205128205129
