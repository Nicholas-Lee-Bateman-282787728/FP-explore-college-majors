This film involves actual Indian actors who were then still living a traditional lifestyle. The introduction by the Indian chief at the beginning is powerful, as he thanks the magic of the camera for preserving forever the story the viewers are about to see, the story of a world that is about to disappear, as he says. I never purchased the DVD because I expected it to have a decent packaging and extras, and maybe a remastering, and I already have The Silent Enemy on Laserdisc. But if you have never seen it, you should purchase the DVD. I will be waiting for a new edition myself. I give it 5 stars, though, because this film cannot be done in the same conditions ever again. It is too late...",1166227200,7,868,4.5
