1218170,5,B00000GHZK,"I'm so happy I have this in my dvd collection.  Ray Liotta is a great actor of our time.  We should all appreciate his presence onscreen.  Want to watch another incredible performance by Ray: Watch ""NARC"".",1043452800,3,205,4.638888888888889
1218171,5,B00000GHZK,"RAY LIOTTA is an incredible and intense actor and this movie showcases his talent better that any movie I've seen. And that's saying a lot. I have to say that RAY is one of the most underated actors to have ever graced the  Silver Screen. Everyone should see this amazing movie. RAY was cast as the  lead character in this film and rightly so. (He was also co-producer.) His  'Harry Collins' as a cop with a gambling problem lets us see a person  losing his self-respect but still living by a code of ethics that won't let  him welsh on a bet. Right there you know this guy is setting himself up for  big trouble, which finds him, in spades (so to speak). Damn, this man can  act!! As we watch him resort to ever desperate measures to get out of the  mess he's in, you hope against hope that his bad luck will turn. Not  helping matters are his cop buddies who even offer to whack his bookie,  Chicago, for him! He declines the offer. He's got a better plan. Why  not  rob Louie, the loan shark instead? Yeah, why not? How do you think it's  going to turn out? (For more information on this movie, check out the  AllLiotta.com website. Not only is there a review but lots of pictures as  well.)",939945600,13,1194,4.267857142857143
1218172,4,B00000GHZK,"Borrowing heavily from the film noir genre, Danny Cannon adroitly lifts the thematic feel, if not the look, of the best ""whodunit"" films of the 40's and beyond.  Updated with the gritty 90's realism of foul  language, ""Phoenix"" is an exercise in the cruel lesson that  morality, or the lack thereof, is measured in small degrees.  Our flawed  and tragic anti-hero, played by Liotta in what may very well be his best  role since his character ""Ray"" in Jonathan Demme's  ""Something Wild"" (1986), systematically exorcises his  ""loser"" demons and his sole vice, gambling, by obliterating every  connection to it in his world by the end of the film.  Though ultimately  doomed, we find ourselves pathetically rooting for him, because he is a  LIKEABLE corrupt cop.  Quite an acting an directing accomplishment for all  involved.  The strong supporting cast includes standout Jeremy Piven, who  demonstrates his range by playing the pathetic wimp of the police gang,  whose wife effectively ruins his life.  Prior to this role, he was in  danger of being typecast as the slightly balding, wise-cracking high school  buddy.  A refreshingly strong storyline against a stark and barren desert  background is complimented by equally strong and passionate acting all  around.  Great entertainment for 2 hours, compared to the drivel Hollywood  usually tries to stick us with.  A must-see if you appreciate film noir,  but don't go see it if you're trying to quit smoking- almost everyone in  the film is a hardcore chain smoker.",931478400,4,1517,5.081632653061225

1218176,2,B00000GHZK,"If you loved The Godfather, if you liked Muholland Falls, if you really dug Copland in which Ray Liotta gave what was maybe his best performance ever, then STAY AWAY from this movie! This was apparently a vanity project for co-producer Liotta, and it shows. He is photographed in crucial scenes in a way that is supposed to emphasize his good looks and graduate him to leading man, and we're supposed to believe that someone with the gravitas of Angelica Huston would even notice our Ray. But we don't. All we keep realizing is that Liotta never WILL ascend to the rank of leading man. Too prissy, too lightweight. Meanwhile we're treated to a story in which woman-hating scumbags conspire to rob each other -- and half of them are cops. The film perpetuates the ridiculous concept -- invented by the overrated Q. Tarantino -- that low-life criminals spend their conversation time discussing the finer points of movies and TV shows. Though Liotta's character is the only one who doesn't despise women, his gambling addiction leads him into downright nasty terrain, with the scumbags as his partners. The casting is quite revolting. Anthony LaPaglia plays a sadistic misogynistic creep and it only makes us queasy because we all know that the actor is basically a good guy. Jeremy Piven is wasted in the role of an ineffectual member of the cop team, but he gives a good performance. Daniel Baldwin fails to impress us as yet another cop scum because the guy seems so scummy in real life that we don't feel he's trying. I couldn't stay with this one to the end. Ray's character was so self-destructive that I felt he should be left to finish the job in merciful solitude.",1472947200,,1670,4.722602739726027

Standout ultra-realistic performances by Ray Liotta and Angelica Huston, who portray star crossed lovers caught up in a whirlwind of evil that is beyond their control. Noteworthy supporting cast, including the ravishing Kari Wuhrer as a disloyal and opportunistic spouse. The film examines the harm caused to individuals and society by addiction, whether it is addiction to gambling, money, drugs, prostitution, etc. Highly recommended viewing with lots of good crime action and gun play. Should satisfy fans of police dramas.",1426118400,2,676,5.509615384615385

1218219,5,B00000GHZK,"I watched this drama many years ago... I'd discovered K-Dramas by accident. It had an interesting name so I watched one episode and it was love for all Korean and Japanese Dramas. Eventually, I purchased the series a few years after that.

It's a lovely series, I think you all will love it. I accidentally started the series from the middle, then after purchasing the series, was able to see it from the beginning. I think watching it this way gave me an advantage, because the beginning is a bit slow... but whoa does it get heated later on!!! Certain scenes, I find myself still watching over again, even after finishing the series; I can't do that for all series, some dramas, once I watch them, lol, they are either too heartbreaking to re-watch or I just can't see it the same way after going through it once. For me, I'll always go back to Phoenix.

It is a love triangle drama...could be a love square, people who know the drama will understand what I mean. There are slight violent scenes which I wouldn't recommend for immature teenagers, but some teens may be able to watch it without there being a problem. There is no cursing or nudity. I think it's a perfect drama for introducing others to the k-drama movement!

Some people feel it was depressing or just a plain feel bad story... I didn't get that from watching the series. If anything, I think the circumstances not being perfect creates a more realistic reality. If you are unable to take dramas where the characters go through the worst circumstances possible before the sun begins to light, this drama may not be for you. If you want a tear jerking, breath gasping, plot thrilling series...this is the one. Highly underrated!",1367193600,2,1696,4.627906976744186
1218220,5,B00000GHZK,I love it.  It was interesting the love story and the how time changes but they love not..  I will recommended to everyone.,1366675200,,123,4.304347826086956
1218221,3,B00000GHZK,This movie is about a gambling cop who tries to pay off his debts by stealing from a pimp.  The movie is dark and gritty.  Ray Liotta does not disappoint.,1350259200,,154,4.1
1218222,3,B00000GHZK,"RL is here in a movie not dissimilar to COPLAND, or 1,275 other pretty cool tantalizers for the unfocused mind. Once again, we see fringe law enforcement officers, on edge. A lotta sweat, cussin', fusin, smokin' ciggies... I'm not sure why. Something about befriending loan sharks, and then owing them tens of thousands of dollars. Gotta watch the DVD again.

Liotta is the only good cop, well, professional in the bunch of babies who play practical jokes on one another...one dude not only plays cop, but loan shark collector, and filanderer. Ray can't stand the guy but he gets so mixed up in his own unethical activities that he comes to rely upon him to crack the safe of the baddest man in town...I forget his name...but he runs a strip club-bordello-drug haven when he's not loaning guys 50k $$$.

Almost forgot to say, Ray is obsessed with old TV cartoons and gambling - he finds peace (usually not riches) in his hobbies.

He has a 19-ish girlfriend, the daughter of Angelica Huston. She the bar owner/bar tender who initially is repulsed by Ray and his inappropriate relationship. Soon, she's gaga over him, too. Her part is very undevelopped, unlike her wild kid. The part of the daughter...is highly unecessary. Unless a good part of the audience enjoys feeling their skin crawl during the sexiest poker game ever filmed between a almost middle-aged man and his love kitten. At least *James Mason* was the instigator, not Sue Lyon. But that was about 49 years ago.

A lady truck driver, near the end, philosophizes with RL, when he thumbs a ride. She does not seem nonplussed by this bloodied up gun wielder. She says, Phoenix is ultimately *not* a cool place, despite the heat. But both agree that any Western town is cool, that has a radio station that plays Robert Johnson!

Some very exciting scenes...but the main interest...Ray Liotta. A feast for the man who played Henry Hill.",1325376000,,1895,4.765243902439025

1218224,3,B00000GHZK,..although I've seen worse. Liotta is the reason I checked this out.  I just saw him in BLOW with Johnie Depp.  Great.  But this one is a low-budget flick that mostly left me not beleiving in the story or the characters.  Cliche stuff that was slapped together quickly for the undiscerning masses.  Liotta's a likable actor and his charm is the only saving grace in this movie.  I still wouldn't recommend it.,1259366400,2,409,4.611111111111111
1218225,5,B00000GHZK,"I am new to Korean drama genre.  This was the first I watched.  I had problems seeing all of the episodes on MBC TV so decided to buy the set.  It was well worth the discounted price.  I love the differences in Korean drama vs. US dramas.  The contrasting formality and campy over-acting was really entertaining.  I also enjoyed the sense that there was a storyline instead of just a bunch of sensational events happening to a group of people as seen in so many U.S. productions.  Knowing that the main character subsequently committed suicide in real life was a big downer.  Overall, I recommend this product and look forward to seeing more Korean dramas.",1250467200,3,656,4.643478260869565

1218230,4,B00000GHZK,"There's no denying that this film is at least semi-formulaic, but the thing is that the writers and the director know how to USE the formula to the advantage of the viewer. That's the difference. Sure you got your obvious good guys and bad guys, but the acting is solid, the pacing is flawless, the characters are juicy, the plotting is strong, and the camerawork is spot on. So what's not to like?

Ray Liotta reins in his often cynically smirky-nasty persona thing to project the character of Harry Collins, a gambling-addicted cop who actually has feelings. Anthony LaPaglia is the bad cop, Mike Henshaw, and, formulaically, all bad--but very very good at being all bad. The babes are not just one-dimensionally hot, but instead, thanks to the presence of Angelica Huston, have substance and character as well as a tough veneer that hides some tenderness underneath. And yes, that's kinda formulaic too, but she's a world class actress who knows how to do this better than a whole lot of others out there.

Harry's gambiling and Mike's debt to Louie--played to smarmy perfection by Giancarlo Esposito (one of the best character actors acround)--results in the gang of four cops (Liotta, LaPaglia, Jeremy Piven and Daniel Baldwin) engaging in some illegal activity to net a lot of fast cash. But since the illegal activity is commited against a guy who himself does a lot of illegal stuff, it's OK, right?

Well, sort of. The main neo-noir plot convention--that things never turn out the way they're supposed to--is followed but again, it's fun to see how they play out in this punchy little flick.

I liked this a lot. This one you watch. Liotta's other neo-noir, Inferno, starts off great and then totally collapses. So that one you don't. But Phoenix works. Yeah.",1155427200,9,1768,4.844370860927152
1218231,4,B00000GHZK,"This 1998 cop flick has no surprises.  There's a good cop (Ray Liotta) who has a gambling problem which causes him lots of grief.  There's a bad cop (Anthony LaPaglia) who is totally bad.  There are gangsters and gamblers and corruption and action.  There's a double cross and flying bullets and even a tender moment or two that Ray Liotta has with Anjelica Huston who is supposed to be the mother of seductive underage young woman. The other assorted bad guys fit all the stereotypes.

Ray Liotta might have a gambling problem but underneath we all know he has a good heart.  We also sense, from the very first frame, what the plot of this film will be.  There's just enough action to keep it from being boring.  And of course there are gun battles and blood.  But the film is convoluted and trite.  That's why I found myself laughing out loud a lot at all the clichs.  This is definitely a Grade B or C film that was never supposed to be taken seriously.  Once that is understood I find nothing wrong in just watching it for the escape and entertainment.  That's one of the reasons I watch films.  And that's why I give it a mild recommendation for gangster genre film buffs only.",1124236800,,1182,4.437209302325582

I've reported it to Amazon so I hope my review will help. This is a review for the KOREAN DRAMA PHEONIX. It has excellent subtitles and picture quality by YA.
STORYLINE
This is the story of a rich girl Ji-Eun who falls in love with poor, hard working student Sae-Hoon who works at a gas station. Same-Hoon eventually falls in love with her as she pursues him daily. As her parents don't approve of him she seduces him in hopes of getting pregnant. They get caught and she's sent away. While she's away she is happy to find out she's pregnant and returns. They get married against her parents wishes on the condition that they won't get help from them. They are happy but poor. Her mother temps her with money. Due to unfortunate circumstances she looses the baby and they divorce.
  10 years pass as he was in the United States and returns with a fianc and she has a boyfriend. You can feel the emotions of the characters and their longing to be together but knowing the reality that it can never be. Sae-Hoon's fianc is in a wheel chair and turns out to be Ji-Eun's friend. He feels responsible for the accident. She turns into a vengeful and tragic person. Hi-Eun's boyfriend fell in love with her at first sight. They are great together but he develops a dark side. This show has so much feelings and emotions that make you feel like it's really happening to you. That's what great acting is at its best. I won't say anymore on the storyline as I don't want to ruin it for everyone, but it's a must have for my collection. I checked this out of my library a lot. I hope you enjoy this as much as I do.",1522886400,,1726,4.324074074074074
7909136,4,B00000GHZK,"This was an unexpected jewel! It's hard to explain...it was a slick crime movie, funny at times (the masks) and the main character Harry (the breathtaking Ray Liotta) gets himself into bad situations with a gambling addiction but when it comes down to it he has some kind of...moral compass. As he says repeatedly, don't ever welsh on a bet! He also takes care of his elderly landlord by settling up with the loan shark the landlord used and making it clear that the landlord is not to be loaned to again.

It's pretty bloody so in that way it's a bit Tarantinoesque, which is not a bad thing.

Anthony LaPaglia is fantastic as the dirtiest of the four cops who hang out together; he bangs one of the other cop's wife, and he collects money on behalf of a loan shark, at one point giving a guy three more days to pay up, in exchange for sex with the guy's wife. Mind you, this is a cop!

 What I could not STAND was Harry getting interrupted by a poker game invitation while he was with 20-year old (so she said) Veronica, whom he met outside an abortion clinic (the cops were handling a riot there)...she was just there for penicillin (to cure God knows what!). They met, he took her to his place, they started to get it on and it was hot...and the poker call comes in. Well, Harry picks poker over sex but he does tell Veronia to take off her bra and come with him as a distraction. That was hot. So they come back to the apartment and OF COURSE Harry has lost. Big time. And there's no sex; nothing. Harry takes her home and she is pissed. I would be too!

You never get to see Ray Liotta have sex in movies...think about it! Tell me one movie he had sex in (I haven't seen them all). I wanted sex to happen! Maybe he has a no sex clause in his contracts. What a waste!

Even worse, Harry is totally taken - thunderstruck - when he drops Veronica off and sees her mother waiting at the front door. And whom did they cast? ANJELICA HUSTON??? What the HELL? How about someone at Ray's level of attractiveness? She was SO WRONG for him. Very bad casting there. For the rest of the movie they kissed a few times. Blech.

Anyway...give this one a whirl. It's an overlooked goodie.",1518048000,,2178,4.2590799031477

There are a few twists that kept me interested along with burying my head in a blanket during the violence. There were some tongue in cheek moments, too.",1479168000,,265,4.196078431372549
