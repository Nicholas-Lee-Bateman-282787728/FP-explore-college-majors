8331425,1,B001OSYW3S,"This is just another rehashing of the four Stooges shorts that somehow fell into public domain.  They feature Shemp and are pretty good shorts but are available anywhere for less money and are usually included in various Stooges repackaging products.  The fifth title, Color Craziness, is far from one of the ""greatest"" Stooges shorts; it's a compilation of live-action skits made in 1965 with ""Curly Joe"" DeRita incorporated into in their cartoon series.  The skits are tepid and uninspired and represent a sad swan song for one of comedy's greatest teams.  I'd skip this product.",1263772800,,581,5.08421052631579
8331426,5,B001OSYW3S,"This is a great 5 episode disc with what could be easily called the 5 best 3 Stooges Episodes of all time.  You even get one with Shemp, the 4th wheel stooge.

BRIDELESS GROOM
COLOR CRAZINESS
DISORDER IN THE COURT
MALICE IN THE PALACE
SING A SONG OF SIX PANTS

BRIDELESS GROOM is the 101st short subject starring American slapstick comedy team the Three Stooges. The trio made a total of 190 shorts for Columbia Pictures between 1934 and 1959.  Shemp plays a voice instructor who has just received an inheritance, but there is a catch: he must marry in 24 hours or he will not receive the money.

In DISORDER IN THE COURT, The Stooges are key witnesses at a murder trial. Their friend, Gail Tempest (a name whose parts are synonyms of each other), who dances at the Black Bottom cafe where the Stooges are musicians, is accused of killing Kirk Robin (a play on ""Who Killed Cock Robin?""). Although the boys disrupt the proceedings, they manage to clear Gail's name and extract the real murderer's identity (Buck Wing) from a parrot (they were able to find a confession tied to the parrot's leg).
