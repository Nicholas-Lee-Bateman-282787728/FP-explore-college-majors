3986250,5,B002TVQ4HG,"WOW! This movie is one incredible experience that is essential viewing for true horror fans as well as those who are starving for an original concept / storyline. Christopher Smith is quickly becoming one of my favorite new writer/directors. He's the creator behind the impressive subway horrorfest 'Creep' and it looks like he's aiming high with this mind-twisting shocker that is completely unpredictable all the way until the satisfying conclusion! This is a movie you won't want to miss! It has a great plot, excellent cast, a strong and confident pace, multiple twists, awesome brutal & bloody attacks, and derives its greatest power from having the viewer empathize with the protagonist's very tough decisions. Seriously, ignore the negative reviews and avoid spoilers at all costs! This is one of those movies you MUST check out! If you wait too long you're sure to hear about it and have the plot twists ruined for you. 'Triangle' is a modern classic.",1265673600,21,959,5.037735849056604
3986251,4,B002TVQ4HG,"I'm not going to talk about the plot because it is something that needs to be watched and will be better with the less you know.

I thought it was an absolutely fascinating supernatural thriller. It is very complicated and doesn't make much sense at first and will leave you wondering long after the credits roll.

The look of the film is great and directed very well. I was very surprised that the cast were not horrible actors. Usually films like these fall burden too the fact that only the lead and maybe main supporting role put on good performances but I thought everyone did a great job, especially the lead.

The dialogue isn't amazing but it is made up by most of the brains of the script being put towards its complex and twisted structure.

It isn't overly gory yet the violence is still incredibly shocking.

I really liked the ending, it still leaves me wondering how some things happened and I really think it needs to be watched more than once. But I don't think the questions are enough to take away from the whole experience of the film.

Overall I thought it was an incredibly unique, complex, thoroughly entertaining, and a clever and very well made film. Unlike many horror films I didn't think this one feel apart at the final act and continued to surprise me right until the credits rolled. I think I would consider this one of my favorites which is saying a lot when considering how many horror films I actually like. Now I may not have found this to be as scary as Paranormal Activity I think all together it is a much better film and my favorite horror film of 2009, if it can even really be considered one. 8.5/10",1265500800,6,1639,4.464882943143813
3986252,5,B002TVQ4HG,"One of the best films of 2009.  Behind AVATAR, STAR TREK and MOON.  This is a rare breed of film, almost unlike any other where I had to immediately re-watch the film to fully appreciate and savor all the unexpected twists and turns.  Also, the film is a gem for the fact that only at the end does one realize that what you think you have been watching has in fact been a 'trick' and that the story was telling you something else all along.  One of the recent reviewers on Amazon stated that he didn't understand what the film was really about.  But the clues are all there.  The name of the 'ocean liner' that the characters hitch a ride on is worth paying attention to.  It ties in directly with the reveal at the end of who or rather 'what' kind of person 'Jess' really is.  A work of genius.  Must be seen in Widescreen.  Blu-ray if possible.

Love or hate this movie for whatever reason you still have to agree: it is original as they come. It has been YEARS since I have seen a movie approach this level. What level is that? You can actually feel your brain thinking as you try andwrap your head around this movie. It makes sense, but it doesnt.

FEAR COMES IN WAVES - movie poster tagline

Four PRESCIENT Stars. Triangle is a 2009 Australian film with a plot that is importantly set in the state of Florida, USA. A young woman, Jess, accepts an invitation to go on a day-cruise on a yacht with some friends. They sail right into an ever-deepening mystery where Jess is unsettled from the start and seems to have premonitions. When a storm hits, everything changes. The films title plays a part in the action, especially as an afterthought when the film is completed. Re-watching the film Is important and reveals many details that are covered up intentionally the first time through, plus a protagonist may have a goal beyond the ending. Melissa and the crew are excellent. Directed and written by Christopher Smith, who did Severance and Creep. Starring the lovely, svelte, and talented Melissa George, Joshua McIvor, Jack Taylor, Michael Dorman, Rachael Carpani, Emma Lung, and a young Liam Hemsworth. Definitely Recommended for time loop, mystery, and creepy movie fans. Four VIOLENT Stars. (Icon Entertainment. UK Film Council. Rated-R. Color. HD. CC. X-Ray.

The several references to the Greek God Sisyphus is a real clue as to whats happening and the viewer must fill in the balks. No, its not about continued killing until you get it right but it may be more about how inextricable some loops can be once you're in it. I like time loop movies and I never expect them to wrap up everything with a clever ending because that pretty much defies the purpose of it.

3986291,4,B002TVQ4HG,"It's hard to say much about this movie without giving away important plot points, so I'm only going to make a few very broad comments here.

""Triangle"" is one of those films which plays with the viewer's perceptions and expectations, making you think you're watching a certain type of movie and leading you to believe that you know what's about to happen-- only to pull the ol' switcheroo on you. Even when you start to figure out how things work in its strange world, this film manages to not become the movie you're being led to believe it will be. You'll likely figure out a lot of this film's strange logic early on, but even that is misleading, because while you focus on the odd physics of the place where this story takes place, there are still some good old-fashioned plot twists and shocking reveals in store for you. At times ""Triangle"" feels like it's drawing toward a conclusion when another series of events is actually starting, and its ending feels much more like a beginning than any sort of grand finale-- which is certainly appropriate for the type of story being told. Nothing is as it seems. In fact, it's hard to even define this film's genre; I see other reviewers describing it as science fiction, but that's not really accurate-- science explains nothing which takes place in this film, nor does 'Triangle' speculate about future scientific or cultural trends-- so if I had to try to pigeonhole this film into a specific genre, I might go with ""psychological horror,"" or maybe even ""horror fantasy"" or ""mythic horror."" Maybe. None of those categories quite seems to fit.

In short, the writing and acting in ""Triangle"" are very good, the scenes are beautifully framed and shot, and the editing keeps the story moving without getting in its way. While most of the film's visual effects are convincing, a few are obviously CGI.  It's a competent film, and more than anything else, it competently tells the strange story that its producers wanted to tell.  This is a smart film which will leave you wanting to watch it again, if for no other reason than to see what you missed the first time around.",1506384000,5,2120,4.690860215053763

3986307,3,B002TVQ4HG,"Ya ya decent flick but I don't know about calling it smart or even clever.
A lot of details were left ignored instead of masterfully addressed.

Sorry but spoilers coming up:

Best examples of this would be near the end after the car accident, there Jess 1 (she's dead in the trunk) Jess 2 (she was driving the car and could not have made it out in one piece, and Jess 3 (she's the one standing inexplicably there with the bystanders)
So where did Jess three come from?
Also from the ship, how did she get back to civilization? She basically and magically woke up on an island that led back to her house - weird.
And if there are a bunch of dead redheads in pile somewhere on the ship then why aren't there piles of the same dude with a fatal  shotgun wound in the theatre?
And at some point the movie made it quite clear there are three versions of Jess on the ship at one time.
What if she just jumped out and announced herself to them every loop and eventually there's like 20 Jess's out there at one time partying like it's 1969?
Personally, I'll go with she is a horrible mother who survived the car crash at the end(maybe she's in a coma), but lost her child and the unfolding of the movie is her mind trying to accept and atone for what she did...think along the lines of Jacobs Ladder and such films.
Is this movie existential or is it two steps removed from being a full blown horror movie...you decide.",1491868800,,1412,4.2611940298507465

Some reviewers I think give away a little too much and make your first jump in not completely cold, (and also I try to never watch trailers for sci-fi movies!) That's probably OK though because the movie is complex and it almost doesn't affect the viewing, but in my opinion, going into movies like this without any real knowledge beforehand is always preferable.

I like how this movie potentially has more symbolism and deeper meaning than other movies such as Primer, Synchronicity, or Predestination. I just finished my first viewing, and have already re-wound to a few different parts. I will likely watch it again before my 3 day rental period is up, and that's something I never do.

8380728,4,B002TVQ4HG,"Enjoyable psychological thriller. There are many helpful reviews here along the lines of movie genres and even Bermuda Triangle mystery theories. This review is written from a psychological and self-reflection perspective following an inquiring approach. In some way, this story is highly symbolic of a psychotic mind trapped in a wheel of despair fueled by intensely emotional knee-jerk reactions. Fear, confusion, violence, self-hatred, and a warped concept of love, all play a role in this plot. Is it true that the main character needs to do what she thinks needs to be done in order to solve the situation? Could there possibly be another way (or more than one) to navigate through such a crisis that chooses inclusion and love rather than exclusion and violence? These questions are not meant to criticize the film or even imply that the story could be better by changing anything. These questions are for you (and me) reading this review and who will watch or has already watched this movie: in which ways are you acting automatically out of fear or despair in your life? Can you see how certain actions, no matter how obviously appropriate they may seem at the time, are keeping you inside a loop of suffering and madness? Say that you run into another you out there. Surprise! Impossible? Who knows? And, frankly, who cares? What if everyone out there is you after all? For my part, I am finally becoming more and more exhausted of hammering down all perceived enemies, all others that seem to oppose me. May we have the clarity of mind to recognize the patterns in our life that seem to keep us trapped. May we remain calm in the face of adversity. May we pause before pulling the trigger against others or ourselves. Thank you for reading. Enjoy the movie! (and your own self-reflection.)",1524787200,,1799,4.825242718446602
