8393558,4,B003BFCNQA,"There are many stories in this opera. There is the historic story, based on the odd Christian 7th King of Denmark in the eighteenth century. There is the philosophical and political story of the Enlightement movement in Europe and its move against the absolute monarchy establishment. I would argue that the most important one of the opera is the emotional and love story between Queen Caroline Mathilde and Dr. Struensee, the physician brought to the court to deal with King Christian 7th mental instability (or insanity).  In fact, the most notorious and, to my mind, musically beautiful arias are Catherines solo aria and Struensee solo one in first Act; and the love duet in the second one.  Drama in history, philosophy, politics and love. Great combination for a great opera.
The music is harmonic and tonal, with some dissonance here and there.  The vocal requirements are not too difficult for the singers, thus letting the many stories develop without too much vocal distraction.  The staging is traditional, with customs of the times, while using technology to create the right sense of place and mood.  The transition between scenes is very well achieved. The music provides some background music while the scene on stage is modified and the characters enter or depart the stage. Very well done.
The sound recording leaves something to be desired. The surround sound dos not work very well. It sounds somehow flat. The noise from the steps on stage are too loud, and at some points the orchestra is too loud and covers the singers.  The video recording is OK. I could have spared some close-ups.
I strongly recommend this DVD, in particular to opera funs looking for something new.  It is the only recording of this opera I know about. I would like other opera houses to consider producing this opera. I think it is more than worth it.",1527465600,,1846,4.859872611464968
8393559,5,B003BFCNQA,"Those FIVE (5) Stars are for encouragement of modern opera, for support of Danish composer Bo Holten. I could just as properly give this DVD ONE (1) Star since it infuriates me to listen to it. Notice that I said 'listen' rather than 'watch.' The visuals are excellent: striking costumes and staging, bizarre but effective make-up, camera work worthy of any movie cinematographer. But it's an opera! And operas are essentially music, and music is essentially sound, and the sound recording of this opera is hideous. Primitive. Unbearable. The singers sound so far backstage that one can hardly evaluate the timbres of their voices. Here we have HD TV on a vast plasma screen, with such perfect colors and such clear resolution that you can spot the plaque on the singers' teeth, but sound that wouldn't be acceptable over a Radio Shack walkie-talkie. Imagine the opposite: glorious five channel sound coming out of a 1960s 14-inch tube TV.

Remember the experience of taking photos on Kodakolor film under incandescent lights? What your eyes see looks 'natural' but when you print the pictures, they're all orange. Here's the analogy: when you attend an opera live, yes, the voices are distant but they sound 'right' to your brain. But if you recorded the opera with a mike where you were sitting, what you'd hear on playback would be dismally distant. With this DVD, we get a disconcerting inequilibrium of image and sound; the camera pans in and out, we see the singers in vivid close-ups, but the microphones just squat on their haunches in the rear of the balcony.

This might well be an interesting theater piece with impressive (though not especially novel) orchestration. But I'm too annoyed to discuss its merits. What a wasted opportunity!",1293840000,5,1748,4.942176870748299
