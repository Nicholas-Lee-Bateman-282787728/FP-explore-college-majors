7844207,2,6303300936,"Film without a plot, unless the viewer believes that a young man from a mental hospital, is Julius, a supposedly gifted & deceased artist. The acting is terrible even from Finola Hughes, who portrays an art critic falling for the mental patient. There's no chemistry between her & the mentally ill artist. Not believable in any sense. I watched the entireity of the film, and felt cheated of my viewing time & perception that the story would get better. The setting is depressing, although I gave it two stars for the character of Julius, as weak as the mental patient, but the real Julius was dead. None of it made any sense, so I'll call it a scrambled film that needs tweeking & stirring about talented genius in the world of art. Not recommended.",1503187200,,750,4.604477611940299
7844208,1,6303300936,"Why would a relatively intelligent, successful female art critic pursue interviewing an artist who is obviously a demented psychopath? I'm sorry, this just wasn't believable. If the premise of the movie was different - the artist pursued and seduced her, his previous stint in the psych ward for the murder of his model/girlfriend was unknown to her - it may have been more plausible. While trying to convince her boss that an interview with him is going to be 'great', she calls him a ""forgotten young artist back from the grave""... REALLY!? He's a demented killer released from an institution for the criminally insane! DUH! Everyone else in the movie knows about his 'dark' past, and actually finds no issues with it, except for her slightly ditzy room mate (and she treats her badly -Played by Moon Zappa). The gallery curator and benefactor provide him with another victim because he repeatedly paints his previous victim (Anna 15, Anna 16)...or so we think...until they look at each other and laugh slyly forecasting that they are plotting something. The script is a poor attempt at suspense with underlying sexual intrigue that is just not interesting, and badly acted. Throughout the movie you'll keep wondering where both the main character's and the writer's head was at.",1502582400,,1281,5.018779342723005

7844211,4,6303300936,"Style and substance, components that are included to some degree within films of either aesthetic or artistic sensibility, are seldom present to the same extent, and that is the case in this U.S./Australian production, with style happily the most pronounced. Director/cinematographer Phedon Papamichael, a master craftsman of cinematic style thanks to his canny use of light, shadow and colour in relation to his cast, maintains visual emotion throughout this work even when the substance, the story itself, wallows a bit. The sound designer, Leonard Marcel, adds to the successful development of the piece, and although there is perhaps some mixing misfortune, scoring and arranging by Tom Hiel, use of a portion of Mozart's Requiem, K. 626, and songs composed and sung by the male lead, Brent Fraser, make for a convincing counterpart to Papamichael's visual artistry. Footage is in the artist's loft district of downtown Los Angeles, the scenario telling of a reporter (Finola Hughes) for a weekly publication of the arts who has discovered a possible major story: an artist (Fraser) who had murdered his model seven years past, now freshly released from his asylum internment, is creating paintings for a forthcoming gallery exhibition, for which the gallery owner (Glenn Shadix), of a practical leaning, finds the resultant gossip of probable fiscal value. After tracing down the reclusive painter, Julian Jons, the journalist, Jennifer Cole, becomes physically attracted to him, becoming his lover, but when a moneyed patron commissions Jons to paint a friend who remarkably resembles his slain model, the painter suffers from flashbacks that suggest there may soon be another victim. The acting is of a quality indicating preparation, with both Hughes and Fraser neatly flanking most cliches in their roles, while good turns are on display from the always competent Shadix, Moon Zappa as Jennifer's roommate, and by Patrick Bauchet in a too brief appearance as Jennifer's editor. Direction by Papamichael is creative, with the players permitted to complete their characterizations in this sadly undervalued film that includes a scene of eroticism that is delightfully unique in its crowded canon.",1184198400,7,2203,5.406976744186046
