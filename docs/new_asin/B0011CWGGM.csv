8241341,4,B0011CWGGM,"I really appreciated the movie about a subject not many people know about.  I think people were expecting a comedy and Depersonalization/Derealization is not funny.  I have had DP for a very long time.

I have had the same response from physicians....I told one doctor about my symptons and diagnosis, he just kept talking about my eye appointment like I had not said anything to him at all.

Also I liked that the movie hit all the topics that come up with Depersonalization;  effect on relationships, how DP takes over your life and the cycling of the whole effect on your life.  Getting well from DP takes over your life.  You put everything on hold until you get over DP.  But you don't know the timeline of when or if you will ever get well.

Although, I didn't get DP after marijuana usage, I am glad the movie represented that this can happen.....people need to know this.
This movie was very informative for people who have never heard of Depersonalization.

If I had any advice for anybody with Depersonalization it would be to seek help from a mental health professional.  Not to be afraid.  That is what DP thrives on is FEAR.  You are not going to die from DP.  It is your body protecting you.  If I had to describe it, I would say that it is a bio-chemical response affecting your eye muscles and/or optic nerve to make the world less fearful/intrusive.  In my experience it makes my vision one dimensional.  You need to get out and on with your life, even with DP.  Getting on with your life is protecting yourself.",1482364800,,1529,4.518248175182482
