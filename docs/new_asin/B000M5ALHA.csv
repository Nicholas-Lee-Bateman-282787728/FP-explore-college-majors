8166609,5,B000M5ALHA,"For those who have read my review of 'Survivors of Stalingrad - Pt 1' you will already know my thoughts; for those who are looking at 'Survivors of Stalingrad - Pt 2' all I can say is; as someone who has an interest in World War 2 and has had very little information from a German perspective on Stalingrad I found the series very informative. It was not what I thought it would be, it was about those who were at Stalingrad and returned to Germany. No matter what you think of the Germans under Hitler this is the story of men who went to Hell and back.",1181001600,2,554,4.138888888888889
