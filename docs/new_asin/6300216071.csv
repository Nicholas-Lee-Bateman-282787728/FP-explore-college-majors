255374,5,6300216071,"This film is one of i-don't-know-how-many in all that clearly reveals ther existence of a great national resource that most people aren't even aware exists -- Roger Corman!
How many illustrious careers began making cheapie films for Corman?
Well, Bogdanovich here, Coppola on ""Dementia 13""...
More recently, Joe Dante (""Gremlins"") and Allan Arkush (""Rock 'n' Roll High School"") and the late Paul Bartel (""Eating Raoul"") have started out working for Corman.
The earliest legitimate film appearances by Sylvester Stallone that i know of are in Corman films...
Bogdanovich had an idea for a new kind of horror film.  Corman had three days of shooting time that Boris Karloff owed him.
The result is a quiet but disturbing film that circles inevitably around and around to a final confrontation.
Karloff's portrayal of, essentially, himself, is wonderful; you can see the big, gentle and genuinely funny man who was behind so many of the great scary movies.
((Incidentally, while it would be nice to think of this as Karloff's ""Shootist"" -- a last, a final, valedictory film to perfectly end his career, as that film ended and summed up John Wayne's -- it is, unfortunately not true; he made three awful US/Mexican films after ""Targets"" [One of them is ""The Crimson Cult"", i don't remember the others].

255376,5,6300216071,"The story of how this film was made is almost as interesting as the film itself. Bogondavich was assigned a ridiculously short period of time by Roger Corman and a very small budget to come up with a contractual-obligation last film quickie for Karloff, with the only condition being that he had to incorporate scenes from the last two AIP Karloff films, flops that the studio was hoping to reawaken interest in. In just a few days, working on a shoestring, first-timer Bogdonavich comes up with this great, self-reflexive, funny, and disturbing film about an aging horror film star who wants to retire, because he feels his old gentle style of scaring people can't compete with modern horrors such as serial killers. This means that the ""showdown"" at the end of the film, where the sniper fires FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN, is not only great plotting, but thematically relevant; throughout the film, we're asked to consider our desire to watch horror movies in the first place. Anyone who really likes THINKING about cinema should love this -- it belongs on the shelf with PEEPING TOM and REAR WINDOW. It also has one of the funniest things I've seen in cinema -- a scene where Karloff catches his reflection in the mirror in an off-moment and, associating the image with years of monster movies, jumps in fear, before realizing it is only himself he's looking at...

255443,4,6300216071,"Peter Bogdanovich himself admits (on this rather interesting but not always insightful DVD commentary track) that he is no fan of the horror genre, and this can clearly be seen in the film ""Targets"", which is more of a restrained thriller rather than a truly horror-inspired flick. Nonetheless, this is an essential film to see if you are into Bogdanovich's early career--if not, it's a rather light Karloff affair, using the manically good performance of Tim O'Kelly to anchor the film in a grim--and thoroughly unpleasant--reality. Karloff fans should own this title for sure, but don't expect it to be a truly great film because it isn't (I still like it though). Now it was a clever idea to do a Karloff ""horror"" title without giving Karloff a scary role or to use much horror stew at all, but this bit of cinematic invention seems a clich to watch now (but it was original at the time). ""Targets"" has some very disturbing scenes of gun violence, and yes this is the original theater shoot-'em-up story--Bodganovich might be ill after what happened in Aurora, Colorado in 2012 during that silly ""Dark Knight Rises"" movie, but why he feels any responsibility over that tragedy is beyond me because ""Targets"" is at least a minor suspense classic if nothing else--but for today's young, I have little doubt that it is all but completely forgotten.
""Targets"" on DVD is rather incomplete (to my way of thinking, as a collector). Why no documentary upon Charles Whitman? Wouldn't this have been an appropriate cultural history piece to include here, since he was obviously the inspiration? Why no commentary by a film historian (rather than director/co-star Bogdanovich)? Why no trailer gallery? And, most significantly, why no little ""making of"" featurette? There must have been one released by Paramount...right? It was Karloff's later period, after all. The picture seems to have been transferred from the source VHS, which is disappointing in terms of transfer--the sound is nothing special either. I doubt this one is up for a Blu-Ray redux. So, overall, if you need a copy of ""Targets"" by all means purchase it, but to me, it's a rather disappointing package. B-",1416441600,,2166,4.9532967032967035

It balances the story of the shooter with a human, empathetic protagonist, Boris Karoff, playing an aging, retiring horror star.  I appreciate that at several points I just knew what would happen next, conditioned by films that came after this, but Brondonovich alwasy pulls back and is more restrained than I thought he would be.

255446,4,6300216071,"Targets (Peter Bogdanovich, 1968)

Peter Bogdanovich is one of those directors who, it always seemed to me, generally flew under the radar where the public was concernedyou don't often hear his name brought up in conversation about great directors, or at least I don'tbut is quite beloved of the critics. Six of Bogdanovich's pictures appear in my collection of top-thousand lists (I currently have eleven on my spreadsheet), including Targets (which appears on three, including the one I consider canonical, Jonathan Rosenbaum's. Interesting note: two of the other six also, and only, appear on Rosenbaum's list: 1990's Texasville and 2002's The Cat's Meow). I finally got round to watching it a few days ago, and I found it quite enjoyable; I'm not sure it belongs on a thousand-best list (though I have rated it such that that option remains open to me, at least until I stumble upon another 250 or so four-star-and-above movies), but it is definitely the kind of slow-burn thriller that fans of the subgenre will be well-rewarded for seeking out.

Two parallel storylines play out here. In one, Byron Orlok (the mighty Boris Karloff), an aging B-movie actor, has just completed a movie he loathes. (I found it very amusing that the footage of the film in question was all lifted from Roger Corman's The Terror, which also starred a young Jack Nicholson, and really is kind of a silly thing.) At the screening, the studio head (hammed up wonderfully by Yours, Mine, and Ours' Arthur Peterson) pushes Orlok to stick with writer/director Sammy Michaels (played by Bogdanovich himself) for one more pictureat which point Orlok announces his retirement, much to Sammy's dismay; not only did he write the lead specifically for Orlok, but he's also romantically involved with Orlok's personal assistant, Jenny (House Calls' Nancy Hsueh), and fears Orlok will haul her back to England with him. The studio has already committed Orlok to appear live at a drive-in theatre where the new movie is premiering a couple of nights hence, and they pressure him to make the appearance, hoping it will be a gateway into convincing him to stay. Meanwhile, Bobby Thompson (The Grasshopper's Tim O'Kelly in one of only three big-screen appearances he would ever make), a sociopathic sort who is kind and happy outwardly but seething with misplaced rage inside, is scouting out places around Los Angeles to shoot random people from while bulking out his gun collection on his father's tab.

It's possible that some of my misgivings about the film have to do with the various summaries of it I've read, which give away much more of the second half than does that synopsisand, more importantly, telegraph the idea that these two storylines are going to intersect much more directly than they do. Don't go into it expecting some sort of apocalyptic clash and you'll probably be more satisfied with the ending, which is anticlimactic and thoughtful and leaves you with a number of questions you will need to think about and answer for yourself. To me, that is one of the hallmarks of a strong thriller, and I appreciated it more than I would have that big apocalyptic clash, to be honest. But since I was expecting it, well, you know. Still, a decently-paced movie with solid performances from its principles, lensed by a director who knew what he was doing better than most? Certainly worth an hour and a half or so of your time. *** ",1395619200,,3413,4.899653979238754
255447,3,6300216071,"Brilliant, it is not.  Still, there's enough going on in Targets to warrant a viewing of Peter Bogdanovich's first film.  Between the shoe-string budget, and having to skillfully horn in previously shot footage of Boris Karloff, the finished product is probably much more refined and linear that anyone should expect.  Karloff is a real treat -- his turn in Targets is appropriately campy, with an empathetic and sunny demeanor despite the film's bleak trajectory.  Targets is a quick 90-minutes or so, but portions of it still feel labored,  with unnecessary sequences, superflourous conversations, and lingering freeway shots that make you wonder if Bogdanovich raided the Cal-Trans closet of 405 stock footage one too many times.

Beyond Boris Karloff, most of the acting is hokey to the point of pain.  And thank god Bogdanovich settled in behind the camera, not in front.  Still, putting this 1968 film into context, it goes directions that were surely verboten at the time.  If Targets was what it took to get Bogdanovich noticed, I'm all for it.  The Last Picture Show and Paper Moon were just around the corner.  Two of the great pieces of cinema I still manage to watch at least once each year.",1392422400,2,1203,4.935323383084577
255448,5,6300216071,"Clearly inspired by Charles Whitman's 1966 shooting rampage at the University of Texas, ""Targets"" is an ultra-realistic view of mental instability, murder and human interaction that resulted in a bunch of people being killed and other lives ruined. It's also a first and last of sorts, being Peter Bogdanovich's first feature film, one of later-director Samuel Fuller's first screenplays, and actor Boris Karloff's last film.

The plot of ""Targets"" revolves around the protagonist's mild-mannered demeaner and home life, which suddenly turns sour when he first shoots his mother, then his wife -- repeating the exact sequence of Whitman's real-world killings in Texas. The plot then varies from what really happened as the shootings move to other places than a university tower building. The main subplot is actor Karloff's career winding down and an upcoming personal appearance at a drive-in movie that happens to coincide with the exciting final scene of the film, where shooter, targets and Karloff all interact.

This is a fine and disturbing film to watch, made all the more so by its mimic of real-life events from just a year earlier -- and produced on a cheapie budget. Bogdanovich casts the whole thing in ultra-realism; there is no Hollywood gloss, no stilted script, no fakes in the actors or prima donnas outside of Karloff playing himself. The locations in the low-budget thriller are also real-world.

The black and white print is a little gritty but it hardly detracts from your involvement. This is an outstanding, hard to watch drama and a notch in the bedpost for everyone involved, first, last or othewise.",1390867200,2,1626,5.128301886792453

His mind is troubled, so he goes to his car and grabs a .45 automatic. He soon goes on a shocking (especially for 1967!) killing spree, starting w/ his own family. TARGETS is a fascinating, topical film about society's dark descent into horrific, inexplicable violence. Bobby's mental breakdown and eventual rampage are set brilliantly against Orlok's -now quaint- portrayals of movie heavies and monsters. Orlok is disillusioned w/ movies and the grisly realities of the world. Unbeknownst to him, he will cross paths w/ Bobby shortly. The Bobby character is like Starkweather merged w/ the Texas Tower sniper, w/ an eerie foreshadowing of ZODIAC thrown in!

255481,5,6300216071,"Peter Bogdanovich produced, directed, edited and wrote the screenplay to TARGETS. The film has a curious and dichotomous quality to it. On one hand Bogdanovich handled the sniper (a very clean-cut Tim O'Kelly) in a very real, threatening and unprecedented way for its time. O'Kelly looks so much like the all-American kid from next door that he is all the more frightening making the film very unsettling. O'Kelly munches on a sandwich and guzzles down soda in-between his targets. Moreover the sniper is ferreted out by a famous horror film idol (Boris Karloff) from the golden age of Hollywood. The confrontation comes at a drive-in theatre of all places in an unusual climax. The film is suspenseful and alluring. Once you start watching it you're hooked. Is there a message to this film? Perhaps there is. The finale is almost pure hokum, but perhaps that is the point. Leave the killings, the violence and horror up on the screen. Don't let it escape into the real world.

255484,5,6300216071,"""My kind of horror isn't horror anymore... No one's afraid of a painted monster.""

With this, director Peter Bogdanovich makes a bold statement about the changing social climate of the late 60's that would reshape the cinematic landscape forever. The words are spoken by a withered old Byron Orlok, played by the great Boris Karloff. Orlok is an old-fashioned and out-of-date actor who is scheduled to make a final appearance at the Reseda drive-ins during the showing of his latest film. Unbeknownst to Orlok and the rest of the moviegoers, an uninvited guest is also in attendance... A man perched high above the screen with a sniper rifle pointed at the crowd. As the movie plays, shots ring out and audience members are mercilessly killed at random, unaware that this film would be their last.

Fashioned after the Charles Whitman shootings in 1966, TARGETS hit frighteningly close to home in a time when the real horrors were the ones unfolding in the streets and newspapers of America. No one was safe when your friend or neighbor could be a murderer in disguise. There are no monsters here, no creepy castles or graveyards. What is also missing, and what makes TARGETS such a terrifying experience, is a motive. Bogdanovich broke new ground in 1968 by featuring a motiveless killer with no remorse and no explanation behind his actions. This would become characteristic in the Slasher genre in the years to follow, beginning with BLACK CHRISTMAS and HALLOWEEN, but at the time, it was quite revolutionary. The inclusion of Boris Karloff, a name synonymous with Horror, is also quite important. An era had ended, and with it went its many monsters. New Horror, including pictures like ROSEMARY'S BABY and later THE EXORCIST, took place right here at home, and could happen to anyone.

Karloff is in his finest form here as always, but the spotlight quickly moves to a charming, handsome, and charismatic young man named Bobby. Tim O'Kelly's disarming smile and cheerful demeanor remove all suspicion even as he travels to the gun store and decides on an ideal location for his murder spree. Still, there is a coldness about him that is difficult to decipher. He is excellently cast in the role.

Bogdanovich keeps the audience at the edge of their seats during a number of stress-inducing scenes. Like in STRAW DOGS from 1971, the violence is raw and extreme. The whir of the bullets are accompanied by quick zooms to give the illusion of movement. Even in the expository sequences, Bogdanovich maintains a high level of interest through his well-rounded and engaging characters.

TARGETS is a brilliant thriller that has had a tremendous impact on the genre. Its rediscovery is sure to leave a lasting impression with modern audiences.

255487,5,6300216071,"Target was one of these rara avis pictures and one of the best motion pictures of this decade and certainly Bodganovich's masterpiece. Its reflexive proposal is consistently actual given the surrounding circumstances that involves us.

Inspired by the bloody facts that circumscribed the horrid memory of crazed gunman Charles Whitman, who killed and wounded forty six people in a University of Texas bell tower in 1966, embodied by Bobby Thompson (Tim O'Kelly) who constructs a true arsenal, before firing randomly on cars passing on the highway.

In addition we should cite the existence of other film recreated by the same incident, we are talking about The Phantom of the liberty directed by Luis Buuel.

But the coup of grace of Peter Bodganovich resides in the dramatic treatment of the film as a whole metaphor that emerges from a clever reflection of a veteran actor of horror movies Byron Orlok (Boris Karloff) who affirms: people no longer are frightened by horror pictures, due real life is more terrifying because every day someone goes berserk and starts shooting innocent people. And the second device is that unforgettable device which blends reality with fiction at he reminded sequence of the theater.

In the decade ranked between 1962 and 1972 , the North American industry shocked the entire world with eight outrageous films attached to the violence far beyond of the conventionalisms. Shock corridor, Dr. Strangelove, The chase, Targets, Zabriskie point, The wild bunch, A clockwork orange and Deliverance were the most emblematic pictures that used the violence as referential landscape to show us the profound disturbance of the social corpus in those times. And it's far to be a coincidence the nuclear bombs and military madness (Dr. Strangelove), racism (Shock corridor), immaturity (Targets), intolerance (The chase), frivolity (Zabriskie) fatalism (The wild bunch) and revenge (Deliverance) have hovered an unthinkable stage through different ways and paths.

Needless to say the painful assassination of Robert Kennedy covered like a dark cloud this singular film. The recent incident was still present in the soul and mind of the collective. A bold and courageous movie miles away ahead from its historical moment, forerunner of late events that still remain closer to this generation as the failed incidents produced on the World Trade Center in 1993 and Columbus massacre, that reveals us once more the reality surpass by far the fiction.

One of these imprescindible films in your invaluable collection.",1287360000,2,2537,5.298507462686567

255529,4,6300216071,"So here is Peter Bagdonovich's first film which also has him in a supporting role as Sammy Michaels, said to be named after Samuel Fuller, who helped on the screenplay without taking payment or screen credit. So the name serves as an homage. Sammy is friend to Byron Orlock, classic horror film actor who is ready to announce his retirement from film.

This relationship is juxtaposed with a Vietnam Veteran played by Tim O'Reily who one day sets on a maniacal course of, first, killing his wife and mother, and then later randomly sniping drivers on the highway and at a drive-in movie theater.

The film is quite intriguing, even if a little on the dull side. It was released in 1967, shortly after the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy. While controversial for its timing, it did not garner much more attention than that. The killing spree's seem random and with little to no motivation for his actions.

Other than coincidence, there is no relationship between the killer and star Orlock, which left the film wanting more, even if the mystery was engaging.

***SPOILER***

I felt the ending was rather anti-climactic with Orlock walking up to the killer after sniping in the drive-in theater and only slapping him like he was a bad little boy. It seemed an understated reaction considering about 5 people were shot including his secretary.

In sum I enjoyed the film and Bagdonovich shows off his abilities at telling the story well, but the film needed a little more at the end to justify the actions of the previous part of the film. Certainly cult and Karloff fans already enjoy this and think those who enjoy a tense thriller might find this film interesting.",1260662400,,1696,4.771331058020478
255530,4,6300216071,"TARGETS was the last opportunity Boris Karloff had to shine. He was 80 years old and in poor health but was only too glad to participate in this film which is a tribute to him and his career as well as a biting social commentary. He plays a retiring horror film star fed up with the exploitation of his name and with what the world has become. This is told in tandem and contrasted with a story of real life horror, a young man who snaps and goes on a killing spree using his easy access to guns to become a deadly sniper who kills people at random. Eventually the stories intertwine and the two come face to face at a drive-in showing of Karloff's newest (and final) film.

This is another example of Roger Corman's acumen at spotting talent and not wasting an opportunity that came his way. Karloff had two days left on his contract so Corman turned to former writer Peter Bogdanovich who had assisted him on THE WILD ANGELS and gave him the opportunity to make a movie. In addition to using Karloff, Bogdanovich had to use at least 20 minutes of footage from Karloff's movie THE TERROR which had been made in 1963. Bogdanovich and his then wife Polly Platt (plus an uncredited Samuel Fuller) came up with the script about the killer (based on the 1966 sniper Charles Whitman) and the retiring actor. The whole picture was done in 3 weeks.

Just as the film was about to be released in 1968, the murders of Martin Luther King and then Robert Kennedy put those plans on hold. Eventually a written prologue about the urgent need for gun control was added and the film did get released but it disappeared quickly. Nevertheless it was well enough received to allow Bogdanovich to make another film which turned out to be THE LAST PICTURE SHOW. Today the prologue is no longer there and the film is marketed as a horror film (because of Karloff) instead of a drama which is a mistake. Actually it's NLA but there are plenty of used copies and they're cheap. TARGETS is essential to fans of Karloff and as an example of clever, high quality, low budget filmmaking. With recent 2016 events it is now more timely than ever.",1252368000,2,2117,4.467700258397933

Going into Targets I really wasn't sure what to expect and this turned out to be a great and very underrated and creepy movie.

Despite being written and directed by Peter Bogdanovich and starring Boris Karloff you never really hear much about Targets, which is really a shame. This movie was far better than I thought it would be. Though often linked into the horror genre it's really not a horror flick in general. It's more of a suspense/thriller. But I sort of see suspense/thrillers as sort of a cousin to horror movies. They both play off some kind of fear. While some have very little in common with a horror movie while others do.

Targets marked the directorial debut by Peter Bogdanovich and it was a great debut. Targets was also written by Peter Bogdanovich and his screenplay was amazing. It's a great character study of a man on edge and on the verge of snapping. The characters are great and very interesting. There were also some nice touches of comedy as well.

The plot revolves around Byron Orlok played by Boris Karloff who is you guessed it a famous horror actor who is now retiring. In many ways, Karloff is sort of playing himself. The truly amazing thing is at this time in Karloff's career his health was very bad, but you would never guess it watching him on screen. In my opinion when it comes to horror actors Karloff is king. And this to me is one of his very best performances he ever gave, which is saying a lot due to the many great roles he has had.

Bobby Thompson played by Tim O'Kelly rounds out the other plot going on as a man who is on the verge of snapping. He seems to be losing his grip on reality. We never learn what made him snap, which does work well. The character is really creepy. He isn't your movie monster; he's a real person and that is what makes him so scary and of course due to the excellent performance by Tim O'Kelly.

Targets isn't an action packed movie the plot moves slowly, but in a good way. We spend a great deal of time with the main characters and come to care for them and come to fear Bobby and what he is capable of doing. The thing that surprises me so much is how well this movie has stood the test of time. Released in 1968 obviously it will be dated in some areas, but it holds up really well.

Peter Bogdanovich does an excellent job here as director; you would never know this was his first film. Each scene he gets the best out of it and never once lets things get boring. Each scene he furthers the characters and the plot and when it comes time for the action he delivers big time. I also loved the touch of comedy that was added and it works and makes this movie even better. Peter Bogdanovich also stars in the movie as Sammy Michaels a young filmmaker and his scenes with Karloff are often hysterical.

Bobby's first rampage about 39-minutes in is still quite shocking. The reason this movie works so well is that it could really happen. Bobby is a man having this psychotic breakdown and after his first rampage later gets a sniper rifle and begins to pick people off on a highway. These moments still work to this day and are still quite shocking. Like I said this is something that could happen and sadly actually has happened.

The final act is quite chilling as Bobby starts killing people with his sniper rifle at a drive-in and that drive-in is where Byron Orlok is to make a public appearance. That really brings the suspense to another level as the main characters are now in danger and we have spent so much time with them it's quite scary as we don't wanna see any of them die. It really is a shame Targets doesn't get the attention it so very much deserves.

This marked the end of Karloff's career he would go on and do a few more cheaply made Mexican productions all were released after his death, but Karloff sees this as his last movie. Sadly 1-year later the Icon would pass away. Karloff was only contracted for two days, while making the movie Karloff actually owed Roger Corman two more days of shooting and while making this movie, Corman asked Peter Bogdanovich to use Karloff. Boris Karloff was so impressed with the script and Bogdanovich that he agreed to shoot more days and did it for free.

As I stated earlier at the time of the movie Karloff wasn't in the best of health and despite that he still gives it his all. A lot of the times when an actor reaches the age Karloff has and their health is failing you can see it in their performance, but not Karloff. This easily rates as one of my very favorite performances by him and again there are so many of his to pick as his best. The rest of the cast is excellent as well. Tim O'Kelly as Bobby Thompson is quite chilling and Peter Bogdanovich and Nancy Hsueh as Jenny both provide great performances.

Targets is a classic of the genre that sadly doesn't get the attention it deserves. In my opinion this is one of the greats and it holds up very well as a chilling piece of work and Karloff was just brilliant. This one is a must see.",1200441600,,5172,4.338159255429162

Karloff, essentially playing himself, is marvelous in one of his last screen appearances, and Bogdanovich expertly juxtaposes cinematic and real-life horror, resolving the tension in an unforgettable finale that unfolds before a giant screen image.

It concerns an ordinary, clean-cut young guy who one day decides to take his gun collection atop a tower and shoot people on the freeway-- no explanation given.  The actor who plays the shooter is totally eerie because he's so normal.  The film came about because Karloff owed Roger Corman a couple of days work, so Corman offered to lend him to his talented protege Bogdonovich, who wrote the script and filmed everything in a couple of weeks.  The way he wove Karloff into the story is really nice.  If you love Karloff, this is as significant as his performance as The Grinch Who Stole Christimas the following year.  It's his last really good film.

There is a very informative interview with Bogdonovich included and the director does an interesting and funny commentary track.  He is so urbane and world-weary, and it's great to compare him as he is today with who he was then (yes, he also stars with Karloff in the film, though his acting is not the best thing about it).",1178064000,2,1089,4.635416666666667

I would give it five stars except it seems to be lacking at least one scene that I saw in San Diego and the film was greatly diminished by its absence.  When I saw it in San Diego, there was a scene where Karloff did read the script and commented how it reflected real horror rather than the theatrical variety.  What was implied (and which gave the added dimension to the film) was that the script that Karloff was offered was the script of ""Targets"".  Thus there were three films being presented.

Tim Kelly, surprisingly like a more wholesome white-bread Matt Damon, is the all-American boy who one day buys a rifle and plenty of ammo, kills his family and moves on to shooting random human targets, first from a water tower and subsequently from behind the screen at a drive-in movie theatre where Boris Karloff's disillusioned horror star is due to make his last personal appearance. No explanations, no motives, just impersonal mechanical violence that's far worse than any horror film. Similarly, it could be argued that there's no real `point' to the film - just a sad observation of the way that reality can be far worse than the imagination. In many ways Peter Bogdanovich still hasn't made a better film.

Bogdanovich decided to make a film that commented on the Charles Whitman sniper case that had recently horrified the nation.  Impossible task?  Not if you see how Bogdanovich weaves these seemingly different story threads.  Karloff, basically playing himself, is a retiring horror star who wants to walk away after making one too many Grade Z chillers.  Bobby Thompson(Tim O'Kelly) is the boy next door whose murderous impulses seem to have no rhyme or reason.  The film follows the pair over a two day period culminating in a shooting spree at Karloff's final public appearance.

255579,5,6300216071,"What does the name Peter Bogdanovich mean to you? Until I read about him on a certain well-known movie Internet site, I associated him with three things: those glasses with the thick frames you always see him wearing during interviews, his smash hit film ""The Last Picture Show,"" and that sordid Dorothy Stratten affair back in the early 1980s. What I didn't know about this once promising director could fill a book--and probably has! I had no idea he wrote articles about cinema for Esquire before deciding on a career as a filmmaker, nor did I realize he's written many influential books about moviemaking. Unfortunately, he shared one trait with his greatest cinematic hero Orson Welles, namely great success immediately followed by career shattering hubris. It happens to the best of us, you know--a great stroke of success leads to an inability to take helpful advice from those who've been down the path before. Sometimes recovery is possible, but not in the case of Bogdanovich. He still does the occasional television project and the writing thing, but his best days seem long gone. And to think it all started under the auspices of schlock king Roger Corman.

As unlikely as it seems, the 1968 film ""Targets"" served as Bogdanovich's launching pad. It's not the sort of film to give birth to a legend, at least not on the surface. Starring the inestimable Boris Karloff at the end of his career, ""Targets"" is a rather schizophrenic film. Two narrative threads wend there way through the movie. One concerns an aging horror icon named Byron Orlok (Karloff), a man weary of making films for audiences living in a world full of random and shocking violence. Orlok feels--perhaps rightly considering the time in which he lives--that the disintegration of society, the rise of incivility and its concomitant violence, has made his brand of quaint horror pass. Why go see an old guy acting like a vampire, a mummy, or a ghoul when opening the daily newspaper or watching the evening newscast provide more than enough chills and thrills? Obviously, the film people around him aren't happy about his decision. They're even unhappier when he initially refuses to fulfill his promotional duties associated with his latest cheesefest. One of the people trying to keep Orlok on an even keel is Sammy Michaels (Bogdanovich himself). He's a film director who appreciates Orlok's living legend status even if the man himself doesn't. Orlok will eventually keep his appointment to appear at a local drive-in, much to his everlasting horror.

Here's where the second thread of ""Targets"" comes into play. A young, boy next door type named Bobby Thompson (Tim O'Kelly) suffers some sort of breakdown. He calmly assembles an arsenal of firearms and ammunition, murders his family, and then proceeds to go on a killing spree throughout the city. His nonchalance about what he's doing makes the blood run cold. For example, after slaughtering his loved ones, he heads over to an industrial area that will give him a clear line of sight to the highway. While munching on a sandwich and taking liberal slugs from a bottle of soda, he proceeds to take shots at passing vehicles. We literally see the bodies bucking in the cars through the scope of his rifle. Frightening. Bobby flees from the scene before the cops arrive, and continues his outrages. His last excursion takes him to the local drive-in, the same drive-in where Orlok is scheduled to make an appearance. Bobby climbs up behind the screen and begins to kill people watching the movie. A movie, coincidentally, that stars Orlok. The final sequences of ""Targets"" seem to fulfill Orlok's fear that real violence has eclipsed the carefully staged blood 'n guts special effects made famous by Hollywood.

It's rather obvious that Bogdanovich took Texas tower sniper Charles Whitman, whose murderous rampage took place just a few years before this film, as the primary impetus for Bobby Thompson. Tim O'Kelly's character simply shares too many similarities with that particular mass killer. He's young, he's an expert with firearms, and he kills his family before unleashing death on the general public. The comparison to Whitman would not be lost on the film's original audience. More interesting is the storyline involving Karloff. Not only does this thread involve an actor soon to pass away after a long career in the horror industry, but it's also likely the best part the aging thespian found in the twilight years of his career. Look at his filmography; he was largely reduced to taking on roles in schlocky Mexican movies and other assorted projects far beneath his talents. It's nice to see Karloff in a movie with a relevant message. That message, as far as I am able to discern, involves the escalation of violence in society versus Hollywood and the easy availability of firearms. At least I think that's what is going on.

Anyway, ""Targets"" is a nice little obscurity with which to spend a few hours. Extras on the disc are slim but there is a commentary with Bogdanovich that is well worth a listen. It's amusing to hear how Bogdanovich internalized Corman's penny-pinching film techniques. He says on several occasions that what we see on the screen is every second of film he shot. Not a scrap went to waste. We also learn how Bogdanovich got his start in the biz and what it was like to work with Karloff. Neat stuff. It's quite sad that Bogdanovich couldn't maintain this quality of work for the rest of his career, but ""Targets"" is one of his success stories.",1124496000,4,5520,4.906852248394005
255580,4,6300216071,"The plot has already been pointed out by other posters on this film. Let me tell you some great elements. The scene where the sniper shoots those on the highway brilliant. The home scenes of the sniper's wife and family are very good too. Fine incorporation of Karloff's real life being into the fictional Byron Orlock (though Karloff, according to director Peter Bogdonavich, didn't put himself down like Orlock does). The drive in climax is also splendid. I'm not bothered by the sniper's reaction  to meeting Orlock in the flesh and not beating the old guy up. He's supposed to be stunned to meet this big movie star. Lots of other great stuff too. The only way this film falls down from great to very good is the totally stupid asian secretary bit. She works for Orlock and is accepted by him as such an equal. Yeah right! And what's more she's the love interest of a very white film writer named Sammy (director Bogdonavich in an acting role). Yes, so many struggling white writers in the 1960's would love to have risked becoming morbid social outcasts by even dating someone Chinese. Real believable stuff. And just to throw salt on dumb wounds she's supposed to have gone to Oxford! Like Sidney Poitier in To Sir With Love she's a minority character way too good to be true. The commentary by Bogdonavitch is good too. Learn things like how the people at the real life gun stores used in this movie thought this was a wholesome film about a young man going hunting with his father.

255583,5,6300216071,"In the early 1960s, celebrated director Peter Bogdanovich (1971's THE LAST PICTURE SHOW; 1972's WHAT'S UP, DOC?; 1973's PAPER MOON, et al.) was just starting his career in the motion-picture industry as an interviewer and critic.  By the middle of the decade, he was working as a technical assistant for renowned low-budget producer/director Roger Corman, with whom he developed a good working relationship and a great mutual respect.
Impressed with Bogdanovich's creative and aesthetic contributions to the projects of others on his staff, Corman offered him the opportunity to write and direct a horror cheapie of his own, and of course, Bogdanovich jumped at the chance.  But this would be a true test of Bogdanovich's mettle, Corman warned, because there would be three restrictions placed upon the project: Bogdanovich must keep the cost of making the film within its meager budget; the film must make prudent use of footage edited out of Corman's earlier cheapie, THE TERROR; and the film must feature actor Boris Karloff (yes, THE Boris Karloff, who was contractually indebted to Corman's production studio for one last film).  The result?  TARGETS, Bogdanovich's suspensful and intriguing two-pronged study of the effects of unrelenting ennui.
In the film, Karloff portrays Byron Orlok, an aged horror star of yesteryear who, despite opposition from his assistant and a director friend, wants to retire from filmmaking.  The world has become so apathetic towards violence, he believes, that everyday events can sometimes be scarier than any of his fright flicks, and thereby his work has become pass&eacute;.
Tim O'Kelly plays a dissatisfied young husband whose lack of genuine success is making it difficult for him to live in the shadow of his overbearing father. When he finally reaches his breaking point, he stoically murders his wife and parents, after which he takes his father's rifles and goes on a sniping spree.
The two stories converge at a drive-in theater, where Byron Orlok is preparing to make a public appearance (and where he plans to deliver his swan song and announce his retirement to his  fans).  After shooting at passing cars on a nearby highway, the sniper hightails it to the drive-in, being drawn there when he notices Orlok's name on the marquee.  When the two men actually meet, the ennui in the lives of each finally comes to a head, but with quite different consequences.
The performance that Karloff delivered in TARGETS is arguably one of the best of his career.  But it wasn't much of a stretch for him, to be honest, as the film was shot just a few years before his death and he was, therefore, merely playing himself.  Peter Bogdanovich not only directed the film, he also played Sammy Michaels, the director friend of Orlok who is trying to talk the actor out of retiring.  A beautiful young asian woman named Nancy Hsueh played Orlok's personal assistant, and she did an excellent job of complementing both Karloff and Bogdanovich.  (Her performance really is outstanding, especially considering that she plays a secondary character, and it's a shame that she didn't go on to greater recognition before her death in 1981.)
Tim O'Kelly also derserves some kudos for the work he did as the discontented sniper.  The role required little dialogue, so O'Kelly had to express most of his feelings and thoughts through facial expressions.  It is really amazing to see the dichotomy of emotion--sometimes a mix of boredom and desperation, sometimes both anger and sadness--that he was able to convey at any given moment.
By the way, Bogdanovich did comply, for the most part, with Corman's requisites. Though production did go a bit over budget, TARGETS was still a low-budget film, even by the standards of the 1960s.  (Since it was both critically acclaimed and a commercial success, the film actually earned a moderate profit for Corman's studio.)  And obviously Karloff was, as required, the star of the film.  But what of those snippets of footage from THE TERROR that Bogdanovich had to add in?  They were were used as the ""movie"" that plays at the drive-in just before the Orlok character is scheduled to address his fans.  Clever, eh?
Priase to Paramount for finally releasing TARGETS on DVD; the long-awaited disc is just fantastic!  Though it doesn't appear as if much, if any, restoration was done, the print that was used for the transfer seems to be in very good shape.  Colors are crisp and vibrant, and there are few intrusive wear artifacts.  There are few extras, but an interesting feature commentary with director and co-star Bogdanovich is included.  And at the going retail price, this DVD is a steal!  Not often is such an excellent gem offered at for so little, especially one that has gained as big a cult following as this film has over the years.
This is certainly one film that is a must-own for Karloff fans.  And those who love well-made, suspenseful thriller will be remiss if they don't add TARGETS to their collection.",1069200000,40,4989,4.981927710843373
255584,5,6300216071,"TARGETS was the directorial debut of Peter Bogdanovich and was one of the last films that Boris Karloff ever made.

Meanwhile, Tim O'Kelly plays a psychopath who murders his wife and mother before going on a shooting rampage with a sniper rifle. It's quite intriguing how the two stories connect and are finally tied together in the end.
The movie causes one to think and is a good film to watch nowadays to consider the impact media may or may not have upon violence.
There are several scenes in the film worthy of discussion, but two particularly stick out in my mind. The first one is when Karloff awakens in the morning and startles himself in the mirror. It makes me wonder how much of a success he might have had as a comedian.  The second scene is when Karloff's character is discussing what to do at the drive-in as his swan song and he decides to tell a story. The story he tells is ""Death Speaks"" by W. Somerset Maugham.  Hearing the story told by Karloff can give one the chills just by listening to it.

Not for Karloff fans only, TARGETS is a uniquely suspensful film that combines a serial killer narrative with that of the final career stage of an aging king of horror films.

There are no dull moments in TARGETS and the viewer continually marvels at the ingenuity of Bogdanovich, the cinematographer, and the sound technicians (this is one of the first studio-supported films that does not use a soundtrack, rather it uses source music only).
Karloff is in very good form here, delivering a subtle, humorous, self-deprecating portrayal that will not soon be forgotten by anyone who sees it. It is a worthy swan song for the great horror icon.
TARGETS looks downright incredible on DVD. Presented in widescreen, the nearly flawless image quality betrays almost nothing of the film's age. There is a short documentary on the making of the film, which includes portions of the trailer (which is itself not included as a supplement on the disc).

Bogdanovich's commentaries are among the better examples of their kind: he explains a lot about how shots were achieved, but he also gives plenty of credit for inspiration from older film makers--like Sam Fuller, Orson Welles, Hitchcock, John Ford, and Roger Corman--and he seems to have an endless collection of interesting anecdotes about the movie business.

Byron Orlok is an old film star, he is retiring. We see the real events in the movie world. Outside a young man buys a rifle and ammunition. His trunk is packed with pistols, rifles, and shotguns, as if to make a point. Bobby eats a candy bar and drives along the highways of Los Angeles. He arrives at a home that is like a TV drama about middle-class life.

Byron gets a funny line about advice to help the people: stop making movies! There is drama at the public land used for practice shooting. Byron's speech shows his talents. Bobby tells his wife about having ""funny thoughts"". [Why is this young couple living with his parents? Why does he call his father ""Sir""?] Byron relives the past by watching an old movie on late night TV. Bobby is sitting in the dark at home when his wife returns. In the morning Bobby uses his pistol, then tidies up his mess. Something has gone terribly wrong. Byron decides to make a personal appearance at the drive-in. There is sparse traffic on the streets of Los Angeles. Does eating a candy bar have symbolism?

Byron tells a scary story that is older than Hollywood. Bobby loads his duffel bag and goes to his selected position high in the sky. Is that area still as open today? Bobby fires at passing cars, then flees when the police arrive. [His knowledge of wrong doing says he is sane.] He pulls into the drive-in where Byron will appear. After dusk Bobby shoots at the cars where the dome lights are on. There is real horror in the drive-in. Bobby continues to shoot at people. Byron limps up on his cane and disarms Bobby before the police arrive. [It is an unbelievable ending.]

There is a lot of padding in this low-budget film. The lighting is not up to Hollywood standards, but seems more realistic that way. This movie sheds little light on this dark topic. It is based on the June 1966 sniper killings at the University of Texas in Austin. That individual had a brain tumor that was undiagnosed before his autopsy. The ""7,000 slain or wounded"" has greatly increased since the numerous Federal gun prohibition laws from 1968. The question about an ""effective"" law is dishonest rhetoric, then or now. State gun control laws have been around since at least the 1850s. Drive-in movies are generally low-budget films because the movie monopolies banned their best products from these low-cost venues (except for second or third runs). Was this film unpopular? The actors did not have much of a future.",1476230400,,2902,4.562380038387716
