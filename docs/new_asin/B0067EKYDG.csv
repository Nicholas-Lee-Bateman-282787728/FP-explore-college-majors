4963624,3,B0067EKYDG,"look no further than Liam Neeson.  With Taken (which I have not seen) and Taken 2 (which I have), Neeson proves he has the intelligence, resourcefulness, cool composure, and presence to sell us on a new Bond.

  If the first Taken (as I understand it) was an efficiently violent revenge fantasy, Taken 2 is basically an efficiently violent ""revenge for the revenge fantasy"" of the first movie.  I will not regurgitate the plot here.  I refer you to Steven Aldersley's Taken 2 review for that.  Instead, I wish to pursue the strong Bondian elements that propel this fast, exciting flick, particularly Neeson's character's  (Bryan's) cool intelligence.  Bryan is captured and hooded , along with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) by vengeful Albanian father Rade (Murad Hoxha) grieving for the white slavery mastermind son that Bryan killed in the first movie for attempting to kidnap his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace).  However, he is able to compose a mental map of his surroundings (Istanbul, Turkey) by listening to distinct sounds and calculating the intervals between them.  That way, he is able to convey a meticulous sequence of directions to Kim, who managed to stay safe at the hotel, so she can pinpoint his approximate location and provide him with a handgun to help him free himself and possibly Lenore.  I don't know if this is plausible, but it certainly seems ingenious.

  Even before all the action begins, we appreciate the precautions and weapons Bryan takes and accumulates (including mini-cell phones and other devices) to handle any dangerous exigency.  Later in the movie, even after being beaten and chained in a filthy basement, it's gratifying to see Bryan not only attempt to free himself, but also give those precise instructions to Lenore, and particularly Kim, to help him and them escape their predicament.  Realistically, both Lenore and Kim are fearful and uncertain what to do, but Bryan's cool CIA-operative professionalism helps keep them focused.  He may be retired, but Bryan is such a one-man assault gang, you get the feeling that Rade and his gang, despite their savage ruthlessness, never really stood a chance.

  Yes, Taken 2 is quite an enjoyable action thrill ride, but I am rating it about 3.5 stars for the following reasons: 1) as other posters have mentioned, much of the action, especially the taxi chase through the very narrow Istanbul street, was shot in that nauseating shaky-cam style that made it hard to follow the action sometimes, and made you wonder how Bryan, for all his skill, actually made it through alive.  I thought Kim was gonna collide with some car any minute - and her without a driver's license, 2) there's a slight whiff of xenophobia, especially in the depiction of Istanbul.  From a distance, it is a magnificent metropolis, but once the movie gets closer, you notice the extreme poverty and claustrophobia of the favela-like neighborhoods.  It looks forbidding.  The Turkish Tourist Board, probably just recovering from ""Midnight Express""'s unflattering portrayal, now has to contend with this movie's, and later, ironically, the latest Bond flick Skyfall's depiction.  First the Albanians, now the Turks.  Europe doesnt seem like such a nice place. 3) you have what Roger Ebert calls the Fallacy of the Talking Killer, which states that instead of killing the hero outright, the villain wastes time boasting and talking about what terrible things he'll do to him, giving the hero a chance to retaliate.  If Rade despises Bryan so much for killing his son, why toy with him so long?  Yeah, yeah, you wouldn't have a movie.  So you go with it.

  Oh, whatever.  Taken 2 is nevertheless an efficient, sharp, involving movie with not only action, but also snatches of humor (e.g. Bryan's reaction to Kim's latest boyfriend, the taxi's barreling towards the U.S. Embassy - ""The soldiers will get out of the way."") So what can we expect of Taken 3? Hmm, I know.  Kim and her new boyfriend Jamie (Luke Grimes) go to Bratislava and encounter a ""Hostel"" situation.  Bryan to the rescue!

  One more trivial thought.  My friend Ron Spiegel, who watched the movie with me, thought Rade looked like ""the most interesting man in the world"" from the Dos Equus commercials. Stay thirsty (for revenge) my friends!",1349740800,6,4273,4.988684582743988
4963625,5,B0067EKYDG,"I very much enjoyed this movie.  Maybe Taken 1 was a little better but Taken 2 was still great! (And, I will buy the DVD when it comes out.)  There is just something real special about watching Liam Neeson go after these brutal, murdering creeps.

This time the film begins in Albania, where the bodies are being unloaded from the airplane -- the bodies of the bad guys that Neeson killed in Taken 1.  As they are being buried, the grieving family surrounding the dead, the head guy and father of one or more of them, vows revenge against Neeson. (I mean, forget the fact that THEY started the whole thing by stealing his daughter.)

The scene shifts to Los Angeles, California, where Neeson's former wife is in the midst of a divorce from her second husband and the daughter is dating.  Neeson is leaving for a couple of days of work in Instanbul and invites them to join him when the job is finished.  As you probably guessed, all the excitement begins on foreign soil, as the bad guys go after Neeson and his family.

It is a great movie, with lots of action.  Yes, some things seem a bit of a stretch, but then (like I always say) the movie you really want to see is the one where a super hero beats all the odds and does incredible things.

Will these bad guys EVER LEARN?",1349740800,138,1277,4.3277310924369745
4963626,5,B0067EKYDG,"In the previous movie ""Taken"" our hero Liam Neeson travels overseas and rescues his daughter from some kidnapers. These kidnappers intend on selling his
daughter to the highest bidder. Her father rescues her. In the newest movie ""Taken 2"" the mother has seperated from her new husband. She and her daughter decide to go on a business trip with their father to Instanbul.. The father of the killed kidnappers is planning on revenge. he has a group of Ruffians in
Instanbul to kidnap Neeson,the mother and the daughter. They suceed in grabbing Neeson and the mother but miss the daughter. Using his black-ops tricks he manages to escape. The hunt is on. Neeson reclaims his daughter and next has to find his former wife. This is where the wild chase scenes take pover. Fast
cars become paramount. Neeson places his daughter at the U.S. Embassy where she can be protected. There is now a confrontation between Neeson and the revenge seeking father. This makes for a stunning conclusion to the story. Be sure to see this movie.",1349568000,2,1023,4.785310734463277
4963627,4,B0067EKYDG,"This of course can't bring what #1 did to the world, but it was very well done.  The story lags a bit in the beginning but it's gets roaring as good as the first.  It's the impact from the first one you can't repeat, no surprising how much of a bad ass he is so that won't surprise anyone.
I think it was well done with a descent story, good directing, but again it's hard to repeat such an incredible ride in part 1 for anyone.
Dirt bags are always an interesting type, they kill and rob people every day of the week but when someone gets them it's revenge time for killing theirs!  Never could figure that one out, but that's how it is, very much realistic I am afraid of especially with gangs or criminal groups.
Again good movie, go watch it.",1349568000,2,746,4.166666666666667
4963628,4,B0067EKYDG,"I knew nothing about Taken when it was released in 2008, but it proved to be one of the best action movies I had ever seen. There was just enough information about the characters to care about them, and the action was intense and rather elegant.

That shouldn't surprise me because Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen wrote the script. Besson had previously grabbed my attention with Lon: The Professional, which is one of the best action movies ever made. La Femme Nikita was another notable triumph. I mention all that to explain why I was already sold on the idea of Taken 2 as soon as it was announced.

So, did it meet my lofty expectations?

The opening scenes were something of a surprise with Brian Mills (Neeson) interacting with his ex-wife, Lenore (Janssen), and daughter, Kim (Grace) extensively. I like that we are shown how Mills has grown closer to Lenore. In the original movie, she was cold and spiteful, but the two are clearly on better terms now that Mills has used his skills to rescue Kim from her kidnappers. It made perfect sense and rang true for me.

The plot is simple. If you remember Marko from the first movie, you'll probably know that he was part of an Albanian gang. In Taken 2, Marko's father is obsessed with avenging the death of his son. He's not interested in why Marko was killed, or that he was guilty of many crimes, he's only interested in seeing Mills killed. When Mills takes Lenore and Kim on vacation to Istanbul, Marko's father instructs his gang to capture Mills and his family. He partly succeeds, but Kim escapes.

The opening setup is quite long and thorough, and I remember thinking that more than half the audience were probably anxious to see Neeson get on with the task of eliminating the opposition in as many unique and violent ways as possible. However, once the action starts, it's relentless and intense. We see car chases, shootouts, fights, threats, brief torture, and a rapidly increasing body count.

Mills wants Kim to stay out of danger, but eventually enlists her help. I'm half expecting a sequel called 'Miss Taken.'

It's unrealistic to expect a movie of this nature to be completely plausible. After all, the basic premise is that a 60-year-old man is capable of defeating gangs armed with automatic weapons. The method Mills uses to escape his kidnappers is so simple that I have to wonder why he didn't do it about 30 minutes earlier, but I'll forgive that.

The ending was quite inventive, and paves the way for another sequel should Neeson and the cast want to reprise their roles a third time.

I did have a few minor complaints, such as the kidnappers talking in English when it's obvious that they would stick to Albanian. Another minor annoyance was the use of shaky cam shots throughout most of the intense action scenes. There's a fine line between adding excitement and losing track of the events on the screen. The line was crossed a few times.

Overall, I was happy with Taken 2. It delivered more of what I liked about the first movie and added depth to the relationships between the main characters. I don't think it's quite as good as Taken because we now know what Mills is capable of, and some of the pleasure of the first movie was seeing Mills demonstrate his unique set of skills for the first time.

Taken 2 definitely works better if you have seen the first installment. Some of the actions and dialogue are direct references to events from the first movie, and you will miss some of the humor if you aren't aware of past events.

Fans of Taken will be more than happy with this worthy sequel.

Two things to remember:

1) Never agree to go on vacation with Brian Mills.
2) If Neeson uses your taxi cab, you probably won't see it in one piece again.",1349481600,6,3740,4.5877061469265366
4963629,3,B0067EKYDG,"""Taken"" was, to me, the movie that threw Liam Neeson into the ""action star"" category. I know he was a Jedi knight at one point, but that was the movie that made it real. The story was compelling, the action amazing, and the entire thing was a thrill ride. While the story this time out is very unique (the relatives of some of the men he killed in the first film are out for revenge) and I loved where it came from, the execution of the whole thing faltered horribly.

While ""Taken 2"" will not let you lose faith in Liam Neeson's ability to kill a man creatively with his bare hands, the director this time out seems to take it as a personal challenge to change camera angles as many times as humanly possible during any action sequence. As a result, any time Liam is talking to someone, it's all calm and steady. The instant he moves toward a person to attack, the director takes the movie into an angle frenzy that lets you know there's a lot of action going on, but you'll never know what it is. It looks as if they didn't want to bother choreographing the fight scenes, so instead they just had Liam jerk around a bit and threw the camera into all sort of close-ups of elbows, shirts, fists, and such with sound effects. During a car chase scene, I counted 65 different camera angle changes in one minute, some lasting just a half a second close-up of a steering wheel, foot on the gas, etc. It's deplorable. At one point, Liam puts his hand on a guy's face and the guy dies, making it appear Liam killed him by sheer willpower. I am all for another one in this franchise (and they easily pave the way for a sequel at the end), but get a better director the next time out.",1349481600,268,1676,4.253918495297806
4963630,3,B0067EKYDG,"Liam Neeson reprises his role as the lethal, always alert agent Bryan Mills, in Taken 2, and I'm very happy he's back, this being a welcome action role return for Neeson.

The story follows the logical revenge plot of the villains' surviving Father, of who's sons Bryan took down in his determined venture to save his daughter from a network of slavers. This round, Bryan Mills enters Istanbul and his ex wife and daughter visit him just as the enemy is closing in.

FAST CAMERA CUTS: 24 cuts every 10 seconds?
Most of the action scenes of which there are plenty (car chase, foot chase, gun battles, hand to hand combat) directed by Oliver Megaton is up for debate. For example, when action begins, there seems to be a sequence of 20 film shots for every five seconds of film, resulting in an MTV like barrage of imagery. This can work if done right, but here, the action, although frantic and full of energy, becomes harder to follow for some viewers, myself included. Just think of the stealth take downs of Batman Begins to picture the style of elbow shots and hard to follow close ups, rendering the battle a series of hard to track motions that don't add up to a cohesive fight all the time.

It comes down to the cinematography, director and editor to make sure the audience can easily follow the action, but here, it's a flash of close ups of steering wheel horns, motion blurred elbows with the occasionally well done distance shots so we understand where the character is in relation to the environment and enemy, Thankfully, the firearm battles are done better, the car chase is overall exciting, and the final fist fight, against a very tough and formidable enemy, results in a well done hand to hand battle (though the editing still leaves a question mark at it's conclusion). The final fight works, because the majority of camera shots show the full body of both fighters, avoiding the extreme close ups of an earlier battle. Why do I mention all of this? Because Taken 1 delivered consistently easy to follow, really well done action scenes.

In the end, Taken 2 is an enjoyable follow up to Taken, and recommended for anyone who enjoyed the ever alert and ready to kick butt style of Neeson's Bryan Mills character.

Taken 2 ends up being a decent action movie. If they make Taken 3, bring back the editor and team from Part 1.

ACTION: 6/10. Plenty of energetic action, though the cinematography/editing is sometimes hard to follow, it flicks through film shots like a flip book. Not a good approach for action movies.
STORY: 8/10. Logical revenge plot and a well done story.
ACTING: 8/10. No complaints here.
OVERALL: 7/10.",1349395200,3,2640,4.666666666666667
4963631,5,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 is the follow-up to 2008's Taken number 1, which I bet you had no idea about. But it's true! Taken 2 is the long-awaited sequel to Taken number 1, and it proves yet again that Liam Neeson is so much more than a guy who saved some Jews in some black and white movie from a really long time ago. It proves that Liam Neeson is still an extremely viable and sought-after action movie star...you know, when more popular action stars like Michael Biehn, Dolph Lundgren and Lassie are busy with other projects.

In this installment of Taken, Liam Neeson, Maggie Graceless and Famke Johanssen are all able to reunite and have some family time in Istanbul (which is a peace-loving, Muslim city that used to be called Constantinople), which is downright offensive when you consider that Maggie Graceless is still playing a teenager at the age of 30 and that Famke Johanssen is way too old to pretend that she was ever Jean Grey or a Bond ""girl."" Anyhoo, though, reunite they do, and just when Neeson's character and Johanssen's character are about to, shall we say, fornicate in a quickie right before they have to take Maggie Graceless' character to the vet, the bad guys from Taken number 1 burst into the room, ending the anticipated sexual encounter.

However, they take Famke Johannsen's character hostage and sell Maggie Graceless' character into white slavery. The movie then ends rather abruptly after some clichd, action-movie developments: First, Michael Biehn, Dolph Lundgren and Lassie all make surprise cameos, which really interrupted the flow of the high-stakes drama in my opinion. Then, Neeson's character finally succeeds in saving both Famke Johannsen's and Maggie Graceless' characters, but, being women, they both get angry with him for ""taking too long"" to finally save them, and they slap him aggressively across the face for his efforts. Finally, in what I can only judge as a totally tasteless move by the director, Liam Neeson's dead wife, Natasha Richardson, is actually shown over and over again throughout the closing credits of the movie, which utterly failed to satisfy the director's apparent desire to have some kind of closure in the movie's plot.

Despite these problems, I can't wait to buy Taken 2 when it is released on VHS soon. In fact, me and my friends will have a sleepover party to celebrate when Taken 2 is finally available on home video. In the meantime, just disregard the extremely negative reviews of Taken 2 on sites such as Rotten Tomatoes because just because everyone says this movie s/u/c/k/s does not mean there is a consensus on this movie's s/u/c/k/in/g.",1349395200,2,2610,4.887133182844244

4963758,3,B0067EKYDG,"The first TAKEN was a ridiculous movie, with Liam Neeson doing amazing things, lots of killing and lots of unlikely globetrotting.  He got around Europe & Asia in a way that makes Jack Bauer's ability to move around LA in the show 24 look like he's dealing with heavy traffic jams all the time.  His ability to never be shot, and yet to never miss a shot of his own was almost laughable.  And his daughter, that he was trying to save, was one annoying brat that most viewers weren't terribly invested in saving.

TAKEN 2 has learned a few lessons.  Most of the film takes place in Istanbul...so there is minimal globetrotting.  There are still plenty of opportunities for scenic action scenes, but at least credulity is not stretched to the breaking point.  (Oh, in case you don't know...Liam Neeson plays a retired government agent with a ""particular set of skills"" whose daughter [Maggie Grace] and ex-wife [Famke Janssen] are in near continuous jeopardy and Neeson is frantically saving them and killing bad guys).  In this iteration of the franchise, the daughter takes a more active role...which is interesting, but doesn't make Grace's character any more likable.  The actress is in her late '20s, but her character is much younger because she doesn't even have a driver's license yet.  Not sure HOW young...but Grace tries to make her younger and it almost comes across like a woman trying to play a little girl.  ANNOYING.

And, as with TAKEN, this movie could benefit from an R-rating.  There is a lot of violence, but not blood. I don't need the blood for the sake of it...but the constant turning away from the results of what Neeson is doing makes the film seem anti-septic.  The GRIT is missing.  These are brutal films...but the PG-13 attitude makes it all seem a bit...harmless.  I think the film might be more thrilling if more seemed to be at stake.

The TAKEN films are a bit silly...no getting around that.  They are modestly entertaining...but there has also been a lot of potential left on the table.",1504310400,,2021,4.725714285714286

4963850,2,B0067EKYDG,"Going from the strength of the first movie... It's just so much of a rehash OF the first one.

Acting is competent and makes the movie watchable, but there are too many ex and deuce machinas to ignore and this movie becomes so weak.

OK... An example... Kim, the daughter, can't seemingly drive well enough to where she has FAILED her driving test three times. BUT in Istanbul, she is a masterful Tokyo Drift driver with a stick-shift taxi. And, that taxi takes SO LITTLE DAMAGE. And the ""empty gun cliche"", played out in the first movie with some good effect for the drama... Gets used... Again...

WEAK SAUCE of a movie",1489968000,2,621,4.526785714285714

4964697,2,B0067EKYDG,"First off the pure image of seeing an average of 4 stars for this movie baffles me. Why might you ask? Simply put the movie is crap. To start the director Olivier Megaton makes it look like the camera weighs a MEGATON!! The way he films the action is horrendous in this movie. He constantly shakes the camera and cuts right when a punch is landed to a different view and back and then cut again. You literally have to make out the fight in your mind which is very annoying when I come to see an action movie.

Story: Bryan Mills takes his ex wife and daughter on a trip to Instanbul when things take a turn for the worse. His ex wife gets kidnapped by Albanian relatives from the last movie (Taken which is a far better film) who want payback for what Bryan did. It's up to Bryan to save his ex wife and protect his family.

Besides the Action rant earlier the film is short, and has a fast pace which is a positive for this movie, because you wouldn't want a longer version of this catastrophe. However Liam Neeson is great in this role as always, Famke Jannesen is okay as Bryan's ex wife, and Maggie Grace is like 30 playing his daughter which is kinda funny because she is supposed to be like a freshman in college, anyway she is not good in the movie.  Overall the film is fast paced, dumb, edited to garbage, Liam Neeson is good, has a decent action scene at the end even though it's edited still kind of horribly, and it's a decent time waster movie but you should definitely not buy it.",1439424000,,1494,4.235087719298246

 I told one of my pals that if he wanted to see a movie where the bad guys get killed in large numbers without a lot of plot to get in the way of the action, Taken 2 is the movie of the week for you.  I thought to steer him to more adult fare.  Instead he said Great, thats just what I want to see.  He is not alone this week.  Taken 2 massed a huge $50 million over the week end and a worldwide total which includes both domestic and overseas of $117 million.  This is on a modest budget of $45 million of which a goodly portion must have gone to star Liam Neeson.  When the people speak with such a unified voice I stand out of the way to avoid the stampede.
 The bad guys are truly the absolute dregs of human existence, soul-less Albanians who make their living enslaving women into prostitution.  The head bad guy tells Neeson that his beautiful daughter will be sent to the worst brothel we can find and be abused by the lowest kind of men.  It essence, it is a re-play of Taken, the 2008 hit with exactly the same theme.
 The beautiful daughter is played by the beautiful Maggie Grace who played the daughter in Taken.  Movie magic has Ms. Grace looking believably like a young collegian, which was easier four years ago than today at her advanced age of 29.  I thought she was about 20.
 Famke Janssen is back as the mom.  She gets kidnapped this time instead of the daughter and has an innovative horror committed upon her innocent self.  Janssen had her first acting gig on Star Trek the Next Generation and has had plenty of screen time both on TV and the movies.  She stared lately as Jean Grey in the X-Men films.
 Liam Neeson needs no explanation.
 Director Oliver Megaton (Colombiana, Transporter 3) re-joins his collaborators, writers Luc Besson and Robert Mark  Kamen.  All three of them worked on Colombiana, a fierce little action piece with Zoe Saldana as the vengeful killer.  Besson and Kamen also co-wrote The Fifth Element, one of my favorite movies of all time.  Besson also produced Taken 2.
 This three saw blade action flick is very well produced.  The chase sequences are good and there are a couple of excellent side lights.  One sequence has the daughter setting off hand grenades in Istanbul so captive daddy can figure out where he is by the sound.  In another clever sequence Neeson tracks the bad guys to their den by remembering the sounds he heard as a captive.
 But well done or not it is still rubbish, outlandish and violent with improbable plot twists that are plopped in from time to time to keep the body count up.  Think of The Expendables 2 done by people who can act, write, direct and produce better than most and you have the idea.
 But I am embarrassed to say that I quite enjoyed it.  I found the bloodletting cathartic, God help me.  And so did a whale of a lot of other people.
 The PG-13 (violence, large body count, no undue gore) film is over in one hour and 31 minutes.  James Bond is coming soon for those who appreciate their bloodletting done with a little more style.",1438905600,,3036,4.370304114490161

4964894,4,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 is an action thriller that features Liam Neeson,who returns as Bryan Mills, the retired CIA agent who stopped at nothing to save his daughter Kim from kidnappers,in this sequel of the first film entitled,Taken. It also stars Maggie Grace,Famke Janssen and Rade erbedija - all of whom co-star to play key supporting roles. It is directed by Olivier Megaton.

After the events in Paris, family members of the men whom Bryan Mills killed while searching for his daughter, Kim, return to their hometown, Tropoj, Albania, for the funeral of the men whom Bryan had killed. During the ceremony, Murad Hoxha, the employer of the men and father of Marko, a victim whom Bryan killed by electrocution, states that they will find Bryan to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. When the father of one of the villains Bryan killed swears revenge, and takes Bryan and his wife hostage in Istanbul, Bryan enlists Kim to help them escape. Bryan then employs his unique tactics to get his family to safety and systematically take out the kidnappers, one by one.

Liam Neeson looks spiritedly enough in the role, and more than capable of another go-round should Taken 2 match its predecessor's success. Unfortunately,it is more of the same, except a little bigger and a little less invigorating. This sequel is simply made for Neeson to cater to his fans as it just provides the viewer heavy doses of action to entertain.

4964971,2,B0067EKYDG,"this is an excellent example of the modern multiplex hollywood genre that i call ""magical heroism"". it requires both that the hero have extraordinary mental and physical powers, and that the world in which the hero moves magically assists his exploits to unfold. in other words, it's complete junk.

two questions you can never ask yourself in a magical heroism movie are: (1) why did that happen? and (2) how is that possible?

how is it possible that a young woman without a driver's license can evade a dozen or more pursuing police cars? how is it possible she can shimmy along a ledge, or randomly throw three grenades in downtown istanbul without a SWAT team response? how is it possible she can ram all the US embassy security and end up in the embassy courtyard without a full throttle military smackdown? how is it possible for the hero to discharge at least two dozen rounds from a pistol without reloading? how is it possible he can sneak up on several guards and dispatch them all unnoticed? well, you're just shown the scenes of these things happening, so shut up and sit there.

why does the daughter use explosions and acoustic triangulation to find the location of her captive parents? (her dad has a cell phone; security forces can tower triangulate his exact location in at most half an hour.) why does the mother, bleeding to death from a cut neck, survive being dragged by her captors across the city? (""it will take 30 minutes for her to die,"" sneers the terrorist.) why does the hero let his daughter drive? why does a second chase car suddenly appear after the first one is demolished? well, why are you even bothering to ask? you're supposed to shut up and sit there.

the level of crass and clumsy fantasy required in a magical heroism film is the signal characteristic of the genre. it floats (if anything found in a toilet can float) because liam neeson is so inherently likeable, and famke janssen still looks incredibly hot three decades after her turn as a ""bond girl"". and yes, you do get to see some shots of istanbul, including the rooftop walkways and bazaar alleys that have figured in many action movies of the past.

the key to a magical heroism film is just to get you in the theater, or get you pushing the button to buy. then it's too late. you've lost your money, you've blown off other opportunities to live your life, you've surrendered control. you may as well shut up and sit there. it will all be over in a couple of hours.",1432944000,,2469,4.564334085778781

What did I think?

Quite simply this should have been called Taken Lite. A surprisingly logical premise justified the sequel but the general action from then on mirrors the original to a point where you're left wondering where the ""meat"" was.

Its not bad  in fact its quite fun and worth seeing  but theres a lack of originality that leaves it feeling like quite a short romp that really had little point to it other cashing in on the popularity of the awesome first flick.

4965096,5,B0067EKYDG,"Kind of gets off to a slow start but I guess you could call it a slow build. There is a nice suspenseful sequence in the middle of the film involving the daughter setting off a series of grenades in a bid to find her father. The daughter departs from the typical damsel-in-distress role and gains points as a kind of accidental heroine. I disagree with previous comments about the fast-cutting in the action scenes. I think the fast cuts serve to disorient the viewer, creating a kind of confusion that happens during an adrenaline rush. I do agree with other commenters that some of the killing blows seem a bit anti-climactic - and maybe even a bit strange - but that's a minor gripe. There are a couple action movie cliches that occur toward the end of the film, but all-in-all it's not a bad action film.",1430697600,,808,4.466216216216216

It felt like it wasn't quite sure where to go. It started out with a bit of the same formula as 1 to where it seemed a little too familiar. Ad a little twist on who is actually taken this time, and then back to formula 1. There wasn't too much excitement...or different excitement I should say. Cast was great and Liam is the reason I kept watching. He has enough bad- - -  to carry any movie.

4965156,3,B0067EKYDG,"Good, but could have been better. Seriously, these type of movies can and will have unrealistic scenes, this is no exception. So, having said that, it is a good movie, but could have been much better. The acting is good and solid, I think it is the director that needed to be better. After the deaths of the kidnapping Albanians in the first one, the ""father"" of one of them acquires the help of some more thugs to seek out Bryan Mills and take revenge at all costs. Bryan has to go to Istanbul and while there, he is surprised and ""taken"" back by his wife and daughter's sudden appearance greeting. Soon, after leaving his daughter at the hotel unattended in a foreign country (after what happened in the first one), his wife and he decide to go out on the town nearby. He is watched by informants in the hotel lobby and upon leaving they are followed. Both eventually get caught and are taken to a hideout not that far from the hotel. Lucky for him because his daughter is an excellent tracker. Bryan and his daughter escape to the American Embassy where in a Taxi, they run the barriers after being shot at by multiple machine guns and weapons and survive unscathed. They sit in the courtyard, heads down, discussing what to do next. Oh, he must make a call to let the Americans know that he is not a terrorist and not to shoot him. THIS after running through the barricade that is put up specifically to stop all traffic! lol See what I mean by unrealistic? Director mistake, big time there. Bryan eventually makes it back to his nearly dead wife at the hands of the left over Albanian kidnappers and takes any means necessary to get her back, alive. This includes meeting the father that headed up the ""revenge"" group and making an offer to him to leave his family alone or else suffer the consequences like that of his son and his recent cohorts. The Albanian gives a second to think about it, but considers that an insult to his son's memory, picking up an unloaded gun and pulling the trigger on Bryan as he is walking away. lol Bryan, turning around probably already knew this scumbag would not honor his own word and throws a bullet at him, then pushing his head back on to a robe hanger, end of story, right?
Well, for the time being anyway.....lol
All make it back to America safe and sound with new one time one movie boyfriend of daughter having a nice little ice cream talking about the future.

4965254,3,B0067EKYDG,"Once the characters, tools, and plot of a film are established, we know what to expect the next time around. It's hard to make a sequel as good as the original, because the surprise factor is more difficult to create. Taken 2, like so many sequels before it, falls victim to this fact. However, with that said, I thought it was a very fun movie, and it did introduce a few new ideas that made it enjoyable.

My only complaint is that in one scene, seemingly every police car in Istanbul is in exactly the area where he is trying to escape and there are literally no other drivers in this district... only cops, all coming for Liam Neeson, in response to a shooting. But then later in the movie, there are long, violent, drawn-out gun fights in a building, for a very extended amount of time, and yet no officers ever show up on the scene. But hey, what do you want from an action film, right?",1429056000,4,892,4.309523809523809
4965255,1,B0067EKYDG,"Boring shoot 'em up movie with no plot.  Husband and wife are captured by terrorists.  Of course, nothing can hold Bryan Mills, so he breaks himself free.  Somehow, he was able to hide a cell phone...at his feet on the ground...and his captures didn't notice.  He was able to call his daughter who ran on roof tops lobbing grenades so Mills would know how close she was.  Of course, no one noticed her running around tossing hand grenades.  Mills, with his sidearm, takes out a dozen soldiers armed with automatic weapons.  And what is with this Mexican stand off thing in fights when Mills and an adversary both end up pointing a gun in each other's faces...and they stop to look at each other.  Right!  Like either one of them is going to blink, let alone pause.  The end was silly.  The captures still had Mills' wife, but they took after Mills head on, instead of using his wife as a pawn by threatening to kill her unless he gives up.  The action scenes were terrible...they were edited into tiny little flashes of action that were impossible to follow.  This filming/editing technique still could not cover up the fact that Liam Neeson is miscast in this type of flick.  He has no fight moves....no game face.  I went in with low expectations, because I thought the first movie was ok, but Taken 2 simply horrible.  I won't be watching Taken 3 unless it's free.",1429056000,,1367,4.540983606557377

I think there is enough hate in this world today.  And somewhere everyone personally has to draw the line.

4965798,1,B0067EKYDG,"Amazon should really make available a No Star option.

Revenge fuels this movie where the bad guy wants revenge for the death of his son by Liam Neeson's character. Here again is the same movie essentially with equally bad plot and action sequences. Tell me someone, who runs across the rooftops of buildings in Istanbul, Turkey while lobbing grenades as if they were army DELTA Force? The daughter! Why did they go there? There were so many things wrong with this script they had to add that garbage.

4966205,5,B0067EKYDG,I've just begun using Amazon video rental service and I really enjoy the access to movies that I would have to purchase on iTunes. I don't want to buy every movie I want to watch and the price point for rental is comparable to a trip to the Redbox at my local store. There's also the guaranteed availability that comes with streaming vs. renting a blue ray or DVD. I'll be using Amazon for my movie rentals from now on.,1420588800,,419,4.25

4966830,2,B0067EKYDG,"Other than having most of the main actors from the original movie Taken 2 is nothing like the original.

In the first movie there are elements of a bumbling dad trying to unite with his wild and young daughter. The ex-wife is believably jaded although still action-movie-helpless and when the daughter is kidnapped then the experienced dad beats up the foolish bad guys. There is at least some attempt at character/plot development.

Taken 2 really jumps off a cliff. The daughter is stupider, the wife is more helpless and ""dad"" is now super-hero-amazing. An added bonus is that the patriarch of the bad guys is not nearly as smart as the original-foolish-bad guys.

Highlights:
If you are ever lost have your teenage daughter use hand grenades to signal her location. No one will get hurt.
If you want to learn how to pass your permit test go to Istanbul and drive ""...faster, faster..."" while crashing into cars.
The ultimate way to kill the last bad guy is to use a combination of the Vulcan-death grip and a shower head.

What made the first one worth watching was the vengeful Dad angle--who could forget the great lines ""It was all personal to me"" or the ""special set of skills"" line? While  straining believability at times, the first TAKEN offered a solid through line to follow and made Neeson easy to cheer for.

TAKEN 2 suffers from bad acting, bad plotting, a bad antagonist, and a bad concluding act. The third act came and went so fast that I thought ""surely that's not it?"" and then the movie ended. The movies was just a collection of action tropes linked together without any soul, charm, or inventiveness.

4967000,3,B0067EKYDG,"THE FILM: TAKEN 2 is a blatant rehash of its predecessor that also has a marked reduction in filmmaking quality, yet it is still watchable due to Liam Neeson's work in the lead role. Bryan Mills is back in this sequel to surprise hit TAKEN, and this time he's been able to get a little more involved with his family while also doing security work on the side. While on assignment in Istanbul, his wife and daughter show up unexpectedly, but unbeknownst to them, survivors of the Albanian family that Bryan massacred in the previous film have tracked him down in order to exact their revenge. What this film makes evident is just how contrived the plot of the first one was, and ups the ante in terms of the lack of believability. While the film starts off in similar fashion to the previous one, there is a plot element which becomes convenient later for the sake of having an action setpiece. This setpiece is a car chase through the streets of Istanbul that has Maggie Grace's character drive like a maniac all while being chased by the Albanian baddies. Other ridiculous elements include a laughable scene where Bryan has his daughter throw grenades into public places so that he can approximate her location relative to his by how long the sound takes to reach him. It's absolutely ludicrous, but still funny at the same time. However, the real negative that can be taken away is the change in shooting/editing style, courtesy of director Olivier Megaton. While Pierre Morel attempted to give TAKEN a modicum of comprehensibility, Olivier Megaton opts for shaky-cam and haphazard editing (frame-cutting, rapidly changing angles) that obscures what seemed like some decent fight choreography. Even the visual aesthetic has been changed to reflect this more down-and-dirty style which, while effective at conveying a sense of urban dirtiness and griminess, gave the film an ugly sheen which put a damper on what could have been a relatively fun adventure. Still, despite all of this and the fact that all of the supporting characters come off as perfunctory, Liam Neeson is able to sell this concept yet again. Overall, its quality doesn't live up to its predecessor's fine production values, but fans of the original should find enjoyment.

THE EXTRAS: There isn't quite as much supplementary material this time around, but there is a rather significant extra which sheds some light on what film this could have been, versus what was delivered to theaters. The extra I am referring to is a 25-minute alternate ending in which Famke Janssen's character is successfully rescued before Liam Neeson takes out the bad guys at the Turkish bathhouse. The reason it was changed is because Bryan Mills' motivation for going back to kill the villains would be stronger if his wife was still captive. I actually agree with this choice in theory, but the execution makes it clear why the chase scene in the final version looked so shoddy. Since she was in the taxi with Bryan and Kim, they would have had to digitally remove her and/or cut frames with her in it, adding confusion to an already choppily edited sequence. Beyond this, the extra features are quite ordinary. There is a 4-minute featurette with Sam (one of Bryan's CIA buddies) giving information on the various tools in Bryan's working case. Interesting, but nothing you couldn't find out elsewhere. There are also a handful of deleted scenes, although only two of them would have added anything to the overall film in terms of character development. Also, similar to the last film there is a picture-in-picture Black-Ops Field Guide. Finally, there's a 5-minute FX featurette with Liam Neeson talking about his character and reason for doing the sequel. He mentions that he enjoyed  the creative space he entered in the previous film, but also that he thought the concept for this film was believable. Sure, whatever you say. When it comes down to it, the alternate ending is the only worthwhile extra.

OVERALL: When it comes down to it, fans of the previous TAKEN will probably see this no matter what anyone says. And who can blame them? It delivers everything that they liked about the first one. As far as the supplements go, the alternate ending alone makes this Blu-ray worthy of a purchase. Recommended especially if you like these types of movies.",1412899200,,4312,4.879945429740792
4967001,5,B0067EKYDG,"I have been a fan of Liam Neeson for years  and I have seen just about all of his movies.  The first movie I saw him in was Schedulers List and I was impressed with his acting.  He has now become somewhat of an action hero type of character, which I love. I enjoyed Taken #1 so much I had bought the DVD.  I did not see Taken#2 at the movies but I immediately purchased it which I got for a bargain price.  I enjoyed Taken #2 even more than the first Taken.

This one has a similar theme but in this one, the father of one of the kidnappers in the first Taken seeks revenge for the killing of his son by Bryan Mills, ex-CIA operative (Liam Neeson).  Mills had some important business to do in Istanbul and invited his ex-wife and his daughter along in order to spend some quality time together.  Unknown to Bryan Mills, the revengeful father has set a trap to kidnap Bryan and his daughter and ex-wife in Istanbul.

Needless to say, this group of killer thugs has made a tragic mistake in underestimating the skills of Bryan Mills.  The movie begins a little slowly, but it is not long when all hell breaks loose as Bryan hunts down the kidnappers.  There is plenty of great action in this DVD.  I thought it was at least as good as the first Taken.

It picks up right where the other movie ended.  Also, this movie clearly leaves an open door for a Taken 3, so hopefully they will make another great sequel.  And lastly, this move includes an alternate ending if you're interested.  But, I have to say that the theatrical version of the ending is much better than the alternate ending.

4967178,3,B0067EKYDG,"This movie at least triples in enjoyability if you look at it as a parody of the first movie. It is 90 minutes of pure hilarity, and kept me giggling through the entire thing. Some of my favorite moments **SPOILERS BELOW**:

-Watch Liam Neeson, resident badass, engage in the most awkward flirting known to man. 'I want to...not punch you? Does not compute.'
-Oh no! It's a standoff, guns drawn! But it's okay, Liam, go ahead and make your phone call to warn your daughter, we'll just wait here patiently!
-Maggie Grace throwing grenades in the middle of Istanbul - no one really notices, no one really cares
-They finally have Liam Neeson, resident badass, in their clutches! Rather than use the chains in the room, they'll tie him up with...plastic zip ties?? After all, they need those chains to hang Famke Janssen upside down like this is Hostel 4. They'll then leave Liam Neeson totally oh-so-securely fastened with his plastic zip ties! What could possibly go wrong?
-One of Maggie Grace's pursuers WHACKILY STRANGLES HIMSELF on a clothesline during their rooftop chase - SHENANIGANS!
-Maggie and Liam manage to decimate their pursuers in the car chase scene, yet Liam insists on crashing full force into the American Embassy before taking a leisurely stroll back to where they originally had Famke before they moved her...but she's still there?
-Poor Famke Janssen plays dead possum basically the entire movie
-The whole movie ends with the family having milkshakes at the beach and chuckling about Liam possibly (probably) killing Maggie's boyfriend.

So don't go in expecting another movie like 'Taken'...expect a movie making fun of 'Taken' (although I'm sure that wasn't the original intent) and suddenly, the movie is still terrible but also hilarious.",1406764800,,1764,5.037671232876712

4967275,4,B0067EKYDG,"I did not have high expectations for this movie going in (the critical reviews are not very good - see for instance rottentomatoes) but it was on sale at bestbuy for $2.99 (on DVD, theatrical release version) so I said to myself why not? In reality this movie is not half bad - certainly not as good as the first (in both storyline or execution) but it's okay. The main problem I had with it is the somewhat strange filming/editing of the fight scenes (which are a little confusing/chaotic sometimes and hard to follow). I think they did that to impart those scenes a certain sense of speed - Liam Neeson is, after all, somewhat passed his prime for this kind of action. Then, there are some other issues with the story - a little spoiler alert here! - which really make the suspension of disbelief quite challenging: [like his daughter driving that stick-shift taxicab like a pro after she failed to pass her driving tests a few times (!?), the driving into the embassy  - ludicrous and physically impossible to do that there, navigation by throwing grenades in the city and other ridiculous little things like that]. All in all, a somewhat plausible story, fairly acted - and for the money - I'll give it four star.",1403136000,,1217,4.58256880733945

4967277,4,B0067EKYDG,"The last time we saw Kim Mills, daughter/ victim in the first ""Taken"", she had been rescued from human traffickers by her estranged father Bryan. And it wouldn't have been unreasonable for her to be severely traumatized by her experiences in that earlier film. But the Mills family are ""amicably separated"" and little Kimmie is about to take her driver's test, as well as dating a boy who Daddy's not sure he approves of. But while the three are tourists in Istanbul, the father of the human trafficker who Bryan killed in the process of revenge for Kim's abduction has just buried his son in Albania and now wants to show Bryan that ""payback is a moyobets""--or however you render it in Albanian. Papa and his remaining sons catch up to Bryan and his ex while they're out shopping, with Kim deliberately back at the hotel so as to ""re-matchmake"" Mom and Dad. Bryan knows that some sort of attempt may also be made on Kim so he calls her to tell her to take preventative measures. Too late--she's already managed to elude attackers there and now proceeds to dash to Mom and Dad's rescue, coached by Bryan over the phone. Running across rooftops and throwing grenades every which way. At one point during the high-speed chase after reaching Bryan, Kim is the driver so Dad can shoot back at pursuers. These scenes turn out to be how the action adventure genre might approach the ""Daddy's Girl"" phenomenon. It's almost anticlimactic in the final scenes when the girl actually takes the driver's test back home. The DMV examiner thankfully doesn't know that this particular ""applicant"" has recently roared all over Istanbul like she was Steve McQueen's daughter in a ""borrowed"" Mercedes taxicab.",1402876800,,1691,4.794520547945205
4967278,2,B0067EKYDG,"The movie is totally implausible. Even if you are an action movie fan, go somewhere else for a film that is realistic in some fashion.
Taken 2 has a ridiculous plot and lousy filming and directing.",1402876800,,197,4.5
4967279,5,B0067EKYDG,"Watch this one right behind the 2 regular versons just to see how much you missed in the first release! WOW, so glad I did as there were some great stuff in there I would have missed.....These are a must have to add to your home entertainment movies...Liam Neeson at his best!",1402185600,,276,4.326923076923077
4967280,4,B0067EKYDG,"If you like infantile macho power fantasies like Batman and GI Joe but don't think they take themselves seriously enough, then Taken 2 is for you! Liam Neeson stars as a paternalistic old white guy who massacres reams of treacherous brown people to protect his helpless, emotional womenfolk. It's even better than the stories I come up with when I play with my AR-15 in the bathtub! (And while I watch Taken 2, mom doesn't nag me to wash behind my ears. I SAID DON'T TREAD ON ME, MOM!)

It does have its weak points, though. For example, sometimes the women talk. Also, a fair number of people in the background of some scenes got away without so much as an elbow to the throat (what kind of message is that sending to our children???). And worst of all the action scenes are shot like an abstract European art film, asking you to ponder random blurry shots of elbows and the backs of heads as they fly through the frame. It's almost as if they're trying to get us to reflect on our increasingly dull familiarity with violence; the scenes blur into an incomprehensible flurry of meaningless carnage individually as well as collectively, leading the viewer to ask, ""why?"" But I guess I should have known they'd try to brainwash me into thinking about stuff: the director's from FR*NCE.

And speaking of things that are for snobs, there are SUBTITLES in this movie. I don't watch movies to read words! Luckily it's just foreigners who talk in letters, so all they're probably saying anyway is ""I surrender!"" Just shoot him in the foot seven times already, movie, jeez louise! Yeahhh, like that. Now impale him on something. Zoom in close! Yeahhhhhhhh. Push it in there with your big, strong hands. Now pick up his blued finish 9mm Beretta 92F. Grip it firmly in your thick, gnarled fingers. Thumb the clip release. Gently! Gently.

I'm sorry, I got distracted again. Between typing this review and the vicarious rage thrill from watching Taken 2, I'm all tuckered out! To summarize, if you're a red-blooded American male, you and this movie go together like high-capacity firearms and Jesus.",1402099200,,2089,4.717808219178083
4967281,5,B0067EKYDG,Taken 2 offers movie buffs an action packed movie with just enough thriller. Taken 2 has great acting and is a must watch for the family. The plot holds strong over the whole movie and Liam Neeson is great and does a wonderful job!,1401926400,,231,4.2727272727272725

Murad: I have come to take you to Tropoje to face you to the people whose lives you have ruined. To give them justice.

Bryan Mills: You mean to give them revenge.

Murad: If it gives us peace call it anything you wish.

Having said that, all kinds of Kick Buttery ensues...They Threatened the people he loves and weren't prepared for the consequences! Excellent film, I'd like to think that I don't just buy everything that comes out so the fact that I invested in this film (and the first) actually lends to how good a film I believe this to be. I'll see a movie in the theater, wait a while, see it on HBO or similar and think ""Man, that was a really good film!"" and then add it to the collection. By then of course the price has dropped Substantially which is an even bigger bonus! Regardless of my methods or reasons, I stand by my assessment - great film.

Spoilers:
Murad: [Bryan has him cornered] What are you waiting for?

Bryan Mills: You have other sons?

Murad: Two.

Bryan Mills: And if I kill you, they will come and seek revenge?

Murad: They will for sure.

Bryan Mills: And I will kill them too. You can change that. You can go home, live your life, enjoy your sons, your grandsons.

Murad: And my other son, Marko: the son you killed... am I just supposed to forget it?

Bryan Mills: No, you'll just have to live with it. Like the parents of all those kidnapped girls. Or you can die here.

Murad: What are you telling me?

Bryan Mills: What I'm saying is: if you give me your word, I will throw down this gun and simply walk away.

Murad: Why?

Bryan Mills: Because I am tired of it all.

4967438,3,B0067EKYDG,"Films that don't need or can't realistically accommodate a sequel are hashed out all the time, and Taken is no exception. The film reinvented Liam Neeson as a late-in-life action hero (despite having a few successful action films earlier in his career) and was a surprise hit at the box office thanks to its neutered PG-13 rating. A harder cut surfaced on Blu-ray, and the famous monologue of Neeson threatening the kidnappers on the phone entered pop culture, giving the studio hope that a sequel would do big business. The gamble worked, and the sequel took more money than the first. Is it any good? I expected the worst, but I actually prefer this movie to the first.

Made four years later, but set unspecified years later, Bryan Mills and infantile daughter Kim are still getting over their disastrous trip to Paris (where you are guaranteed to to be kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery, so don't even think about it). Former-bitch former-wife Lenore is now back in love with Bryan and surprises him on his last day of a Istanbul assignment by showing up at the hotel. New trip, new disaster. Will the Mills family ever learn to stay at home in America where nothing ever bad ever happened to anyone?

The daddy of the evil kidnapper in the first movie has somehow managed to find Mills and has an army of lowlifes (all of them dressing in dirty 1980s clothes that seemed to have washed-up in a lost container on a Yugoslavian beach some time in 1991) willing to sacrifice their existence for the most arbitrary of reasons (untaxed pay and the boss' approval). Mills and wife are quickly kidnapped and it's up to Kim to rescue them and let him loose to kill, kill, kill the evil foreign men.

I found this film to be more exciting and the danger was ramped-up. It lacks the variety of locations of the first movie (almost every scene is set in a dark alley), and there are some ludicrous plot contrivances (Mills' CIA pals fixing everything with a phonecall or the fact that Jean-Claude still has the same job despite his massive corruption being exposed) but it moves fast enough to make it a non-issue. The action is hard-hitting and Neeson is still a force to be reckoned with as he effortlessly dominates the movie with his presence.

The Blu-ray looks great in 2.40:1 1080p. The movie was shot in a strange combination of Super35 and anamorphic Panavision with lots of high brightness and contrast. Not amazing photography, but it looks nice. The DTS HD-MA sound has some good punchy effects during the action scenes. A bunch of decent extras are included.",1392768000,,2570,4.679203539823009

Doesn't Liam Neeson have the integrity not to appear in a cynical exercise even if it is a followup to his biggest hit?  The answer is to have his character taken and will his kidnappers regret the day they messed with Liam.  This film moves at such a razor sharp clip that there really isn't any time to ask questions.  ""Taken 2"" is a complete adrenaline rush of a movie that doesn't take itself seriously so don't look at it too closely.  For instance why do the Turk officials let Liam leave the country after he dispatches a few dozen Albanians in his wake? Why does the American Embassy release him after he barrels through their roadblock putting a few dozen bullet holes in his vehicle?  I told you to stop asking too many questions!

In this film the guys fathers is hell bent on Neesons blood so he tries to kidnap his  ex-wife and daughter. Of Course,  Neeson  eventually wins by a margin but the fun is watching him do it. A lot of reviews have panned the film for being boring and unexciting but it is not that bad. I had fun watching it even though most of the stuff is lame. Towards the end, there is even a hint of a sequel. Three stars.",1390348800,,747,4.061224489795919

The ""bad guys"" looked like bumbling fools who never really were a threat to anyone.
The plot was also weak. Taken 1 was soooo much better and was a 5 star movie in almost all
respects. If a Taken 3 comes out, they need a lot of serious re-evaluating to do. Laim Neeson

4967594,3,B0067EKYDG,"The one man demolition machine that is Brian Mills is at it again: killing people with impunity; this time on the streets of Istanbul. Basically, the family patriarch back in the old country, Albania, finishes burying what remains of the scumbags Brian wiped out in Paris, and vows revenge. He seems to be some kind of mafia godfather who has the usual connections in high places. He quickly finds Brian's location, on a long weekend with `Lenny', his ex-wife and Kim, his once airheaded daughter, in Istanbul, where Brian's just finished protecting the family of some uber rich oil sheik or similar, and starts off to find him with a second cohort of equally nasty scumbags in tow.

Having bribed his way through typically corrupt officials high and low the patriarch sets up camp in what looks like a deserted and run down Istanbul apartment. The apartment block itself looked to be in a very similar part of town to that which both Tom Cruise, in Night and Day, and Clive Owen, in the International, visited. Obviously, the roof tops of old Istanbul provide a good location in which to shoot the odd roof top set piece.

Anyway, having located his prey said patriarch and minions duly `take' Brian and Lenny, in order to fulfil his and the film's mission and truss them up with chains and such like in what looks like the apartment block's basement. Then, being conveniently incompetent, leave them alone with a conveniently incompetent sleepy headed scumbag guard outside. Kim, who, during the film's opening, had received a driving lesson from Brian back in LA, has managed to avoid being captured, by stealing a taxi, and also manages to retrieve Brian's mini arsenal of assault weapons. Brian gives her instructions - yeh, they are able to communicate; I won't say how - and sets about enabling Brian to let her home in on his exact location!

Kim duly retrieves Brian and, now performing like a seasoned rally driver, picks him up at the start of the obligatory car chase through the old streets and alley ways of Istanbul.

Obviously, I can't say how this all turns out but I'm sure you can guess! It's nowhere nearly as good as Brian's first outing and does contain a similar number of sizeable plot holes but does provide some action-packed entertainment, albeit a bit too predictably and we do get to see the rooftops of Istanbul once more!

Here's looking forward to Taken 3 the inevitability of which is set up quite nicely at the end!",1388534400,,2449,4.725995316159251

I like how they made the mother who you hated in part one grow the f--- up and let her ex be the man he needed to be to save lives.  I liked how the daughter now understands the world is not a fairytale as she thought it was and to see her survive under pressure was a nice subtle message to all teen with angst that parents do know best.

The action scenes with him fighting are laughable. The shots of him so chopped up and jerky so you can't see how fat and slow he is. All of the characters are predictable and their stories not believable. I wish I had stopped watching when I realized how lame it was shaping up to be. Super lame.,1384041600,5,463,4.333333333333333

4967723,5,B0067EKYDG,"I have not been able to get to the theater for taken two and after seeing the Blu-ray with theatrical version, unrated version, and an alternate version, I'm kind of glad that I did not get to see the theatrical version first. The unrated cut in taken 2 is again living proof that the unrated version is the gold standard; I've yet to see any exception to that rule. As the basic blurb on the film synopsis indicates, the turnaround is that the parents get taken. The big difference in approximately the latter third of the film is that it takes an entirely different ambit to the theatrical cut (and I can honestly say that I can't see why they did the theatrical cut the way they did, but there is enough in the film extras if you to make up your own mind). Without giving too much away, they might have called this taken 2; the revenge: however it's more of a vendetta type of situation and I like the way the film has a fairly good prcis of the characters (on both sides) so you can see who has what motivation, and who were the ones that you are going to side with (obviously you are meant to side with Bryan Mills and his family). If you liked TAKEN ONE As Well as  Liam's film UNKNOWN, then I think you will really like the action, adventure, and exploration of a great deal of motivation in the agents.
 There is an alternative ending they supplied, which gives a radical change to the general feel of the film: it's about 25 minutes of fully complete material and has a radically different run in the motivation and action to the extent that you might even be able to get three films out of the entire material. There are five major deleted scenes in the extras, of which the foot chase is the longest and actually provides a lot of intriguing background, in my view. In one of two bonus materials there is a small discussion with Liam Neeson and it really gets into his motivation in the film (not necessarily his character's) as well as the way he works and what he likes about films; it's very enlightening. The final neat bonus is an in-depth animatic of the black ops box (the silver case he takes everywhere) and it is fairly obvious that is very well thought out. Overall, I was not sure if I was going to enjoy this film, due to a lot of negative reviews, but after watching the original TAKEN in saying the somewhat more thoughtful film UNKNOWN (which is based on a book, a spy thriller) I was willing to give TAKEN 2 a try, and I'm glad I did. It's a whacking great ride and loads of fun.",1382659200,3,2507,4.298097251585624

He brings forth a character that is larger than life itself, but makes that fable believable, even if it is only in the movie.  The action scenes and the ability of Neeson to deliver it rates the movie 5-Stars in my book.  Liam Neeson is proving that he is a powerhouse star of the Action Dramas, and anything he does will be a big seller at the boxoffice. In Taken 2, he resurrects his character as an ex-CIA field agent that has a seemingly unending well of resources from which to draw whatever is needed at the time.

4967771,2,B0067EKYDG,"I thought the movie was pretty good until they caught Liam Neeson (Bryan) and Famke (Lenore) or Lennie as he called her. So Murad and his men capture Bryan and Lennie and instead of killing them for the revenge of him killing his son he hooks him up to some kind of pipe and scratch his ex-wife and turn her upside down to bleed out.  Like they don't know Bryan can get out any situation by now? His daughter was great when she was determined to help her parents and I felt like she had her father's courage. And the way he told her to find him was brilliant.  But when Bryan and his daughter finally got away and went to the Embassy and he came back to find Lenore his ex-wife laying in some dark corner barely breathing, not once, but TWICE at two different times, I could not take the movie seriously anymore.  Also when the ""bad guys"" were dragging her around, trying to escape and hide her, she kept making the same grunting noises GRUNTING ""No, Let me go"" instead of screaming loudly so her husband could follow her screams and find her. She should know by now that her ex-husband would have surely been looking for her. I would have screamed Bryan help!!! Follow my voice!!! She was also a terrible actress, all she knew how to do was lay there on the floor and act like she wasn't breathing and when Bryan found her TWICE, she started breathing again.  Really? Did she have sleep apnea?  I DID like the end though, when Bryan gave Murad a choice to live or die, and left him the gun.  And when Murad chose to use the gun, he killed him, but didn't really want to.  But he obviously thought ahead of time and took the bullet out of the gun knowing that if he left him the gun he just might try to use it on him.  But the ex-wife, no wonder he divorced her. ha ha  It was also the directors fault for not making her more believable too.",1382054400,,1842,4.2102272727272725

4967831,2,B0067EKYDG,"""Taken"" was, I believe the first attempt to transform Liam Neeson into a macho action hero, and I suppose it succeeded, but it also transformed him into a truly dull person. The first film was ham-handed, unbelievable, and also pretty unappetizing,
with its ""white-slavery"" plot underpinning. But, as with anything Luc-Besson-related, it's all about the kinetic action.  And that's fine, if the director brings something to it. He doesn't, and the mawkish Hallmark family stuff just dumbs it down further.
  ""Taken 2"" concerns itself even less with plot... it's just a relentless revenge tale, also clumsily directed.  In terms of believability, it makes any ""Die Hard"" movie look like a documentary.  I realize these movies are not about realism at all, but the car-
chase scene, where the daughter (who failed her driving test 3 times) goes all Steve McQueen on the tiny twisty Istanbul streets, is ridiculous, and if the director was attempting to be ironic, he failed miserably.
  I think the worst thing, aside from the fact that no one in the film is at all likeable or remotely interesting, the film is totally devoid of humor. Suspense, thrills and humor CAN co-exist.  (witness: ""Die Hard""....the first one only!!)
  I DID actually watch both movies, got 'em from my library.  They were good for practicing bass guitar, not much to think about, bouncy, relentless soundtrack. So, really, just an aerobics video.

The Albanians whose sons were murdered by Leeson in ""Taken"" are out for revenge, and they corner Leeson and his family in Istanbul. What follows are wild blazing car chases through narrow streets and bazaars, with car-to-car shootouts, pileups and crashes, countless well-choreographed karate chop-chop martial arts battles between Neeson and the thugs, pop-pop shootings, stabbings and garrotings, and torture scenes.  It is extremely formulaic, very much a cutout of the original, but you can't help cheering for Neeson when he commands his daughter -- ""stay focused"" -- and proceeds to kick, shoot and flail his way through legions of surly-looking Albanian thugs, emerging remarkably unblemished.

4967863,4,B0067EKYDG,"Even though I enjoyed watching Taken 2 tonight, the truth is it's *extremely* similar to the first Taken.  Only because I'm such a huge fan of high octane action films such as this one will I give in and award the movie 4 stars.  It's realistically more like a 3-star film.  Anyway it stars the always talented Liam Neeson doing exactly what he did in the first Taken- chasing bad guys around with guns and his fists, and specifically and strategically planning the best ways to instruct his daughter to avoid being captured by the kidnappers.  Liam's daughter and wife play larger roles in the storyline this time around (at least the daughter does- the wife is basically spending her time being a helpless captured victim).

I have to be honest.  Even though Liam coming up with these carefully planned directions to either guide his daughter to safety or help him escape where he's being held/captured, I have to laugh at how unrealistically sharp and skilled he is at his technique.  It's unintentionally really funny to me how he never misses a beat when explaining what to do and where to go.  I wasn't laughing in the first movie when Liam did the same thing perhaps due to his character being really believable and just plain good, but now it seems really funny for some reason.  Probably means Taken wasn't meant to have a sequel and segments such as these weren't meant to occur ever again.  That way we could preserve the greatness of the original Taken and recognize it as one of Liam's highest achievements as an actor.  The sequel kind of ruins what made the first one so great.

What seems particularly odd about Taken 2 however, is all the storyline segments concerning Liam's daughter.  She doesn't want to drive, she doesn't have the confidence to pass her driving test, and she doesn't believe she's good enough at parellel parking, however all these issues magically go away just as soon as she's forced to speed away from the gun-carrying kidnappers.  Suddenly her driving abilities improve dramatically (with a couple exceptions).  It's odd writing.  It's almost like her driving problems never should have been included in the script and were only included because the writers couldn't think of another way to make her character memorable.  Also, it's hilarious that she doesn't hesitate to pull pins from grenades and toss them across the street (a fairly clever piece of writing here, though probably not realistic but I could be wrong- you'll see why when you watch the movie).  Basically Liam is using the sound and the amount of seconds that passes after the grenade explosion to figure out where he's being captured.  His daughter is able execute these instructions without feeling any fear which is odd.

This movie is also a victim of camera jerking during the action scenes, which means when Liam is running around beating people up, we don't really see it- all we see is the camera jerking all over the place.  I can't recall if the originl was guilty of this same noticeable flaw.  I strongly dislike when movies ruin the action scenes with quick camera movements.  Also the writing in several spots is incredibly cliched.  Of *course* Liam doesn't approve of his daughter's new boyfriend, and the boyfriend acts exactly as you'd expect- very confident, willing to shake hands, willing to present himself as a perfect gentlement.  Meh.  The original Taken was too good to resort to this kind of boring and obvious writing.  I'd expect the same out of the sequel.

Overall, Taken is a highly exaggerated but ultimately disappointing sequel.  I really should give it 3 stars but... I can't, because it was entertaining.  Sigh, haha.",1377820800,,3664,4.834670947030498

4967890,3,B0067EKYDG,"This sequel to ""Taken"" is more of the same, the first film was so believable & was a real no holds barred suspense thriller about a former CIA operative who knows his way around the world & gets the guys who take his daughter for the purpose of white slavery, he kills many of them in his quest to find her, & rescues her at the end, this follow-up had a good premise, with some family members of the people he killed in the first film wanting revenge, but I feel they really should have had the bad guys coming to Los Angeles to get their revenge rather than have another overseas mishap, some years have passed since the first film's events, & Liam Neeson once again commands the screen as a over protective father, there are some highlights such as him & his ex-wife(Famke Jansen) sort of re-connecting, but then he has a overseas assignment where he is protecting a world leader, once the job is done his ex-wife & daughter make a surprise appearance, this is where you really have to suspend belief, why would a daughter who was kidnapped want to take another overseas trip?, why would her mother want to even take her overseas after what happened in the first film, & why would Neeson even be happy they were there?...knowing the dangers all around them, what follows is more of the same as Neeson & Jansen are taken this time, & the daughter (Maggie Grace) has to help her parents, again there is so much suspension of disbelief here, when what they should have done is have the bad guys come to L.A. & Neeson fight them there, that would have been more believable, this like many sequels suffers from sheer laziness on the part of the filmakers who know they have an audience & do nothing different, this one has its share of action, but it could have been sooo much better!!...& it wasn't.....this one is a mixed bag for me.",1376438400,7,1833,4.44213649851632

4967905,5,B0067EKYDG,This is a fast paced action thriller. The plot moves very quickly and there are a few added surprises as the script develop. There is a lot of violence and parents should take that into consideration before watching with young family members.,1375574400,,242,4.785714285714286
4967906,2,B0067EKYDG,"There are already over a thousand reviews here about this mediocre thriller and I would think most of the obvious faults have been covered already.

So my dig is to the title. It sounds like it should be about alien abductions or the rapture or one of those current themes. Everything about this movie from the packaging to the movie itself suggests the producers knew they were being shoddy and attempted to conceal it. It takes a half hour to even have a clue who the good and bad guys are. It is a strictly formula movie done with cut-price actors. Yet the viewing public continues to support such second-rate efforts so maybe people are getting what they deserve.",1375401600,,667,4.605042016806722

4967942,4,B0067EKYDG,It was similar to the first one. Alot of action and it keeps going throughout the whole movie. It's one of those movies I could watch every once in awhile on tv. I wouldn't buy the movie but it's nice as a weekend movie as you flip through the channels.,1374624000,,253,4.08
4967943,4,B0067EKYDG,I like Liam  the action was OK. the story was the same as the first one. But the family was acted pretty well.,1374624000,,110,3.782608695652174

AND they're not coordinating the travel but plan to surprise him there?  Are we all nuts?  The action is great.  The acting is a bit less so.  The locations are fantastic.  You can almost smell the market.,1374624000,,385,4.588235294117647

4967947,3,B0067EKYDG,"As often happens, the first part of the movie is devoted to showing how bad the bad guys really are; my wife walked out on this one when the villain was threatening a woman captive by telling her the terrible things that would be done to her daughter. Once it is established just how bad they really are the story can shift to the hero's resolution of the problem when he starts killing the bad guys.

This is, of course, a sequel to Taken and picks up when the father of the bad guys in the earlier movie decides to get revenge for the death of his son. It is set in Istanbul and makes one grateful not to be there. There is a lot of shooting, fighting, and chases and offers an adequate action film for those who enjoy such things.

You may want to rent it before you buy it; I do have Taken in my collection but I will not be adding Taken 2.",1374364800,,844,4.047904191616767

4968023,2,B0067EKYDG,"I am a fan of Liam Neeson and enjoy action movies in general. However, I expect the story of the action movie to be developed in a reasonable manner on top of showing the bravery and physical fights. Unfortunately, this was not the case with this movie as I will explain in what follows. First, the director/film-writer does not seem to be familiar with the city where the story is supposedly happening, i.e. Istanbul (a city in a country named Turkey). Or he is intentionally showing it extremely ugly which I hope is not the case. Having been to Istanbul at least twice myself, I can tell you that Istanbul is very European looking with a lot of people dressing in a Western style. The second and main reason why I was disappointed with this movie was because the story was so cheesy and the dialogues were so phony. As if the director did not bother developing the plot so the viewer would feel the smoothness in the flow of the story and find the events reasonably natural. I just do not understand, for example, why one should drag the boyfriend into the movie when there is no significant role? Or in the last action seen, when did Liam Neeson take out the bullet before the criminal guy get the hand gun?

In the end, why should we drag people's religion into the movie by showing the Muslim prayer in the opening scene and broadcasting the Adhan (Islamic call to prayer) several time in the movie as if all of them are evil? After all, Turkey is a secular country with close ties to the West in general and USA specifically. I do not think it is a good idea to instigate hatred by stereotyping.",1372464000,,1602,4.430508474576271
4968024,4,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 was a very rehashed plot point which is why it wasn't the greatest sequel I could have experienced. That being said, I LOVED the way Liam Neeson handled the material and, if you watch it right after part one, it feels like the natural progression of the story and you can gain a whole new appreciation for this film. Famke Janssen is painfully hot and I love that they set up her return to him, which was my only grip about part one. He proved he was right and fought a One-Man-War to get his daughter back, comes home injured and the wife still goes with the rich idiot at the end of one. WTF! But beyond the similar plot from one, this is a solid sequel and can't wait for part 3.",1372291200,,690,4.118518518518519

He has to deal with his family in danger, both mother and daughter and does a fine acting job of handling the pressure.

The first movie was i thought very believable and awesome with its action.  this one was Just kind of typical and of course he saves both the wife and daughter this time.  And of course they ended it with the definite possibility that there will be a Taken 3.  I mean the sons now are going to have to come after him.  I just hope the family isn't stupid enough this time to take a vacation in a terrorist country.,1371081600,,493,4.09375

4968101,5,B0067EKYDG,"My question is when are they coming out with a Taken 3, lol. The 1st one rocked and this one was a perfect addition/conclusion to the 1st story.

4968103,2,B0067EKYDG,"This is just an ok movie. Liam Neeson isn't quite as convincing in this one as he was in the first. And I found some of the scenes simply unbelievable, for example, his daughter running around throwing grenades and nobody, especially the police, noticing? Really? And her little race along the rooftops, again with grenade, and Daddy showing up just in time at the right place after dashing around in a maze of streets? I don't think so. Thankfully, there probably won't be a third one now that everyone in the family has been ""taken.""",1370736000,,535,4.6421052631578945

4968105,5,B0067EKYDG,"Original ""Taken"" gets 5.1 stars. This sequel gets a 5.0 stars. Only because the viewer having seen ""Taken"" knows the family subplot. Same family characters but new villians. This time in Istanbel not Paris.  It doesn't take long to get going. Good tension throughout. Well directed. Good writing, especially the scenes where Neeson is talking to daughter over the phone to determine the location where he is being held and tortured.

What matters is that no matter how many bad guys are killed, this family of three stays tight.  At least they give some effect of the bad guy's family sentiments.",1370563200,,608,4.716981132075472

4968120,3,B0067EKYDG,"I expected more out of this movie, but for some reason it was just a lot less exciting. Whereas Taken 1 just about didn't let you breathe from the moment his daughter got to Paris, this one had a boatload of very slow scenes. I actually got bored, and the chase on the rooftops of Istanbul was done better with Skyfall. And what is up with the chase scenes in Istanbul needing everyone to go to the rooftops?

The HD streaming was outstanding with few artifacts or burps from a slow server. No complaints there.

But the movie was just kind of boring.",1370131200,,551,4.339805825242719

4968147,3,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 is the sequel about retired CIA operative Bryan Mills (Nielson) and his wife who are taken hostage by the father of a kidnapper Mills killed while rescuing his daughter.

I very much enjoyed the original Taken movie, which made me believe Nielson could do an action film and be believable.  Nielson again is solid in his role again and the action is good and non-stop.  What brings thing back to an average rating is the plot is a bit unbelievable and unrealistic.  It seems to me that they made this sequel only due to the success of the original with the thought in mind of capitalizing on the success of Taken.  Some sequels should not be made for the sake of a successful first movie.  Taken had a great ending that really left little to bring back into a sequel and although I thought Taken 2 was entertaining, I really wish they had left well enough alone as the ending and the story wasn't nearly as satisfying as the first.",1369958400,,939,4.430232558139535

4968307,1,B0067EKYDG,"Very, very bad.
Here's a conversation that had to happen at one point...just as an example of how stupid the plot is in this one...

U.S. Embassy Staff: So, your car, being driven by your teenage daughter who doesn't even have a driver's license, just crashed through the barriers on the street that are designed to stop suicide bombers in large trucks...and made it through the hail of gunfire coming from multiple soldiers armed with machine guns and neither of you got hit by a single bullet.
Bryan: Yes. Because the police chasing us were working with the people who were holding me hostage, threatening to kill me in revenge for an incident in Paris recently. They have kidnapped my wife. They cut her throat and she's slowly bleeding to death. I've already killed a few of them, and a police officer who I'm pretty sure was working with them, although I shot him from some distance, so I hope it wasn't his wife asking him to bring home milk that he was talking to on his cell phone. Anyway, I have to go back out there and find the kidnappers, kill them rest of them, and save my wife.
U.S. Embassy Staff: Okay. Get out there and hunts them down! We'll watch your kid for you. Have fun!
Bryan: Can I borrow a gun or two and lots of ammo?
U.S. Embassy Staff: Sure thing! That's what we're here for!

4968396,2,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 is a big reason why Olivier Megaton should not make movies, especially a sequel to a fun and successful film like Taken. His other two films, Transpoter3 and Columbiana were both terrible. Taken 2 is better than those movies, but not by that much. Nearly everything good about the first Taken is not in this.

The characters are pretty much the same. Liam Neeson's character is still the same in this. His character is the one thing this movie did not screw-up. I never cared for Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen's characters. The good thing about the first Taken is that they did not have much to do. In this they have a much bigger role. They are still not interesting. Plus, the ways they get out of some of the situations in this movie are beyond lame.

The action scenes are terrible. The fights and car chases are so terribly edited that I did not understand what was happening. It is like the film was edited by a monkey.

4968435,3,B0067EKYDG,"Unfortunately this sequel to the excellent ""Taken"" (2008) provides little new and is certainly inferior to the original.  In this Olivier Megaton directed money grab, Liam Neeson remains effective as a former government secret agent.  In the original, he goes after Albanian goons involved in the sex trade.  They made the mistake of kidnapping Bryan Mill's (Neeson) teen age daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) which put Bryan in full on battle mode where he is able to use ""his special skills.""  This time, Kim's is still a teenager trying to pass her driver's license exam after a couple failures.

As an aside, I'm a big fan of the TV show ""Californication"" and 29 year old Maggie Grace has her own ""special skills"" in her role as a rock `n roll groupie in the recent season.  For her next role maybe she can play a high school student on ""Glee.""  Anyway, even if Kim can't parallel park, she can sure drive the hell out of a Mercedes cab, complete with a manual transmission.  Hard to focus on the plot, or lack thereof.

Bryan is on assignment in Turkey and the Albanian head of the family, Murad Krasniqi (reliable Rade Serbedzija), is out for revenge.  He and his henchman travel to Istanbul and get a bonus in that Kim and Bryan's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) meet him there.  This time Lenore and Bryan are kidnapped and Kim must play a key role in getting them rescued.  There's nothing overly offensive except the script, especially some of the dialog.  Like ""Kim, drive faster"" or ""Kim, go go go"" and of course Kim freaking out.

4968462,4,B0067EKYDG,"Another intense installment of the Mills' family misfortunes.

Criticisms that the team behind 'Taken', including one of my favorite director/producers Luc Besson, are repeating themselves is fair.

However, and this is important, that's like criticizing a home run because the batter only just made it over the wall.

The fact that the ball went over at all is a blessed near-miracle nowadays and we should be grateful; especially in the US market where facile, plastic, and pathetic are commonplace. In all honesty, I haven't seen such a dearth of weak sorry excuses for filmmaking since the late 70s-thru-mid 80s, where schlock was king. This is a new Dark Age for many cinephiles. The digital revolution allowing ill-trained, ill-equipped, lowest common denominators access to the technical and commercial inroads that were previously closed off, disgorging a stunning plethora of cinematic garbage.

So remember that when considering formula films. What they lack in creativity, they more than make up for in pure adrenaline enjoyment.

As before, retired field agent Bryan Mills is placed in the position of having to defend his family from a host of nogoodniks. However, in a twist, he finds himself as the primary target.

Having righteously killed his daughter's kidnappers, and as family is the theme of the franchise, what he had forgotten was that those worthless turds had family too. Angry families. Gangster families.

Despite the fact that Marco, a.k.a. Mr. ""Good Luck"", was a sincere bleeping scumbag who kidnapped young women, violently raped and abused them, then dumped them into slave pits to suffer a horrific and sickening life of drug induced prostitution and an anonymous garbage dump of a grave - his father doesn't care what his p.o.s. of a son did, only that it was his son that was killed. And he wants his pound of flesh. Literally.

The obvious failing, and one that did slightly annoy, was the plot avoidance of Revenge Rule No. 1: You can never go back.

Once you burn a bridge, especially when it's filled with people, that's gone forever. You can never return to where that bridge once stood. But what do the Mills do? Seriously, Europe should've been dead to them. Even an English or Irish trip would've been risky. The continent? Forget it. There are at least three other global land masses one can explore over one's lifetime. Lotta room in the world not to have to repeatedly bump into people. Especially people who detest and hate you.

Other than that minor complaint, 'Two' was a kickass epinephrine rush!

Very solid four.

Personal Note:

- I'm a huge fan of Leland Orser and would love to see a film just about his character. The man shares the technical, political and badass intelligence background as the main character, Bryan Mills, but seems infinitely more hooked into the system. Two pennies: His backstory has a ton of potential.",1366502400,,2882,4.979166666666667
4968463,3,B0067EKYDG,"""Taken 2"" was okay. It was not dynamite like the first installment, however. I'm glad I didn't go to the theater to see it, but it makes for a decent rental.

4968466,3,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 suffers from the typical movie sequel clich, the second one is not as good as the first.  Both movies followed exactly the same formula: villain kidnaps family of the hero, car chases ensue, body count mounts, hero kills head honcho villain in a climatic confrontation, hero and family live happily ever after.

But while Taken was a fantastic movie and had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, Taken 2 was kinda ho-hum.  I had two big issues with the plot:  1) The whole kidnapping, chase, and rescue scenario was so far-fetched  that it was almost laughable.  2) The villain was made to look too ""human"".  In the first scene of Take 2 the villain (a gray-haired old man) is shown burying his son and other family members and vowing revenge against his son's killer.  In a different movie this story line would have made this man the hero.

This movie had me shaking my head and rolling my eyes so often I felt I was as unbalanced as the film halfway through it.  I personally feel this to be the weakest effort of Neeson, an opinion, I suppose, made all the easier to come to for the fact he seems completely incapable of fulfilling the requirements of the character.  A question: how do you create the illusion that a person is more capable and deft in hand-to-hand combat vs. 7 thugs all the while remaining completely stationary and as slow as Kim Kardashian's acumen? You edit the living crap out of a 3 minute fight scene with hundreds and hundred of stop and go cuts after every single dodge, punch, or lunge. Are you kidding me??

4968572,3,B0067EKYDG,"The first Taken really catapulted Liam Neeson in an unexpected genre: the action super hero. It was fresh, original and exciting. That was in large part to Neeson himself, who is so unassuming as ex-CIA Agent Bryan Mills; but he is such a talented Actor and the characterization was done so well without doing too much in the first film. So when Taken 2 came out, I was really excited. However, with the good, there is the bad.

*Spoilers ahead*

GOOD: Neeson is as awesome as ever. More importantly, he continues to be believable and virtually carries the whole film with some help of Maggie Grace, aka, Kim Mills. The whole cast was back, from the ex-wife to his group of spy friends to the French Inspector, even if briefly for most. The plot had lots of potential with the Albanian family of the men Mills killed, coming after the Mills family for revenge. The action is good, fast-pace and typical Luc Besson, ala Transporter.

BAD: Pretty much everything else. I don't mind repetition when done right. However, the screenplay, as a whole, is a complete bust and tries waaaaay to hard to recapture the energy and quiet intelligence of the first Taken. For one, it nearly mimics the first movie in every respect, including dialogue, which got cringeworthy. It is also set just months after Kim's rescue, which didn't make any sense since the actress was 29 at the time and didn't look like a high school girl about to get her driver's license. The characterization of the ex-wife, Lenore, is the second  worst in the movie, but Famke Janssen did her best but it wasn't good enough to compete with Neeson or even Grace. The overall performance is forced, stilted and cliched. The worst characterization of the story is Murad, the Albanian leader who kidnaps the MIlls and is the father of one of the slain kidnappers who first kidnapped Kim. The writers did poorly in developing a truly evil counterpart to Mills. He is not this scary evil villain that you're glad the good guy disposes of accordingly. He was not even close to Mills stature and to not have a villain who is worthy and equal to Mills was just pathetic and for me, weakens the movie.

Ugh, the dialogue; it got distracting and was horrendous. Ignore it to truly enjoy the movie. Besson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Professional/dp/B00170F0WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Professional</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B003YZNCBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>), who is one of my favorite directors, is not the best writer; he should have stuck to directing this film himself which is something he does best and this movie could have used it. The cast does its best with what it was given but even they seemed to know how bad it was throughout the film. Again, the overall CONCEPT of the plot held promise but it quickly unraveled to the predictable and nonsensical. Thankfully, the action is what propels the film, as well as Neeson's electric performance.",1365724800,,3048,5.124748490945674

4968592,4,B0067EKYDG,"TAKEN released in 2008 was a tightly woven thriller that boosted Liam Neeson's already burgeoning career: he was a killer's killer and managed to garner acclaim from critics and audiences alike.  Now we have a sequel (and there may be more, as the end of the film suggests) that just isn't up to the same standard as the original, but for those who saw Part 1, then Part 2 will likely not disappoint.

The film opens in Albania where the old father Murad Krasniqi (Rade Serbedzija) is burying his son and some villagers killed by Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and he vows revenge. Switch to Los Angles where we see Bryan and his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen), who is recuperating from her second divorce, and their daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) who is entering her first relationship with Jamie (a promising Luke Grimes) arguing over priorities.  Bryan still loves Kim and Lenore and when Lenore tearfully confesses her frustration that her plans to take Kim to China to regroup emotionally have fallen through, Bryan announces he has a job in Istanbul, Turkey - 3 days worth - and invites them to join him after his job is complete.
But of course in Istanbul Bryan's mission involves offing all the people from the Albanian crew and when Lenore and Kim arrive the family is re-bonded until Murad directs that all three be captured and killed. From there it is the predictable cat and mouse games of capture/escape/killing by every means possible/ car chases action and the few who are left in the end make a pact of sorts...and more need not be said.

Oliver Megaton directs a screenplay by Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen. One of the glories of the film is the opportunity to see the many sites of Istanbul. This is not a bad film at all - it is just not up to the standard of the original even thought he players are the same.  Grady Harp, April 13",1365465600,,1847,4.56797583081571

4968623,1,B0067EKYDG,"Thanks to the first film of the TAKEN series, under the auspices of 20th Century Fox, Liam Neeson as butt-kicking ex-spy Bryan Mills has successfully rebranded himself as one of the elder statesman of action cinema, now able almost to be spoken in the same sentence as names like Willis or Stallone. Then after that came a series that should have pushed the point home that he didn't belong there, with films like THE A-TEAM and UNKNOWN, which were both terrifically bad films. Unfortunately, he reteamed with A-TEAM director Joe Carnahan for THE GREY, an existential survival thriller that was well-received amongst fans and not unliked by critics. So, the Neeson Express was still rolling, and Fox, never knowing when to let a good idea lie (see the ALIEN, PREDATOR or DIE HARD series for evidence of this), decided to try to create a franchise out of what could only really succeed as a one-off. This led us to TAKEN 2, and what is one of the most boring, most unentertaining and really, one of the stupidest films of the year.

Basically, the film revolves around Mills' recently-divorced ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen, reprising her role) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, also reprising her ageless role) surprising him in Istanbul very shortly after he's concluded his protection service there. At the same time, the father (the wasted character actor Rade Serbedzija) of the ""Good Luck"" Albanian who Mills let fry in the chair from the first film, has sworn vengeance on Mills and his family. But instead of the daughter being taken, it's him and his wife. And Kim is the only one that can assist her father. And through a series of increasingly implausible scenarios, Mills takes the bad guys on to save his ex-wife.

I know that some people felt that there could never be a sequel to a film like DIE HARD because of how singular that film felt. Four sequels later, they're still expanding the idea to a fault. Well, TAKEN, because of its specific plot (kidnapped daughter), can really only work once, and as evidenced by this film, it's true. Bryan Mills, while being a badass, is little else. His motivations to save the wife of his ex-wife, who seems very keen on rekindling their relationship after her latest marriage ends, seem much weaker than a father protecting his daughter, and his pursuit of their assailants seem much more languid and rote. This is obviously a film that is going to hold no surprises, and to be honest, that should be enough. But the direction by French-director-with-the-greatest-action-film-director-name-ever, Olivier Megaton (TRANSPORTER 3, COLOMBIANA) is, similarly to his previous work, pretty uninspired and has no real excitement or vitality to it. Even the ""final fight sequence"" is dull and unimpressive. Neeson is just going through the motions here. I appreciate that actors are working people, and that they need to get some change in their pockets, but Neeson must have turned down better films than this. Janssen just exists to look nearly unconscious through most of the film, and Grace, who I really loved on LOST, and thought she was a lot of fun in the film LOCKOUT, has an expanded role here, but still makes not much of an impression. Plus, how old is she supposed to be? In LOST, she seemed to be in her early to mid-twenties, but in these films, she seems to be in her teens, and it really doesn't work.

I'm going to perhaps spoil something here, so you might want to not continue reading if you don't want to know more about the most idiotic point of the film. The film opens with Bryan looks to give his daughter driving lessons since she keeps flunking the parallel parking part. Of course, this means that a certain part of the film will require her to drive. When we get to this film's been-done-a-thousand-times-before car chase, she is inexplicably behind the wheel and instead of there being any beats where she is driving the car poorly, or is freaking out because she can't get the car in gear, she is driving this car like Jason Bourne on a bottle of No-Doz. She is doing things with a six-speed manual transmission that master stunt drivers would be envious of. And the finale of this chase scene culminates with Bryan instructing his daughter to drive DIRECTLY THROUGH the gates of the American Embassy without stopping, assuring that 50-caliber machine guns and other weapons begin firing at the car. And you know what? That's not even the stupidest part of the scene. It's when Bryan makes a call to one of his stateside spy buddies that puts an ignominous cap on this frighteningly moronic scene.

If I didn't think that TAKEN 2 was a bad idea before I saw it, I can guarantee to you now that it's a way of wasting valuable time that you will never get back. Skip it.",1365292800,,4744,4.739709443099273

I am embarrassed for Liam.  He is a very talented actor. Even he couldn't deliver the lines in the beginning part of the  movie to make them believable.  The lack of a script writer was obvious, I think the actors made it all up as they went along. The movie doesn't make sense at any time. I don't understand why people didn't notice when a l6 year old girl was throwing grenades off roof tops in the City.  Her driving made me crazy along with the idiotic dialogue between father and daughter.

I cannot recommend this movie at all.  Except for one piece of interesting geographical information I learned about the city of Istanbul this movie is a complete waste of time.",1365120000,,832,4.4144736842105265

Its undeniable that Liam Neeson is a fantastic body guard that has a very special set of skills to do a very special set of things, but at the rate these plot holes are being filled in, when was the studio going to stop and tell us that that our money for this terrible sequel was needed to help budget out a film that had already been done?

I was more waiting for him to just to wipe them out, ending was a let down as well for all the build up and potential it had.

He always seems to play a genuine and believable character no matter what movie role he plays. However, I gave this movie only 3 stars because of its jumpy and inconsistent scenes. It didn't flow as well as the first one. Is it the directing, editing, both?  For example, when his daughter drops the gun down the roof vent I didn't see her drop extra cartridges with it and yet after he empties the gun on the bad guys then reloads and continues blasting away. Its 'amazing' how he can avoid a zillion machine gun bullets and yet drops a guy with one shot. Even Rambo got hit once in a while. Also there were parts in the movie where it was difficult to understand what they were saying even when we turned the volume up. Oh well, we still enjoyed the movie and hopefully the next sequel will improve on this one. According to the revengeful father, he had 2 other sons who will surface for sure and seek more revenge.

Of course, watching Liam Neesom kick some behind is never boring and is always a good time. Like the first movie, in my option this is the kind of movie that you have to watch from beginning to end to know what is going on. I also suggest watching the first movie, if you haven't already, so you will understand the link to the bad guys and the location that they are in, and Neesom's protectiveness of his family.

So, if you liked Taken then you will want to see Taken 2. I watched Taken 2 for Liam Neeson. Simple as that. When you like an actor you watch his or her movies and hope they don't do anything which disappoints you. Liam didn't disappoint. Its action almost from start to finish. The bad guys are out for revenge on Neeson and his family for what Neeson did in Taken.

Neeson is in fine form, but the plot is too similar to the first film that it suffers the same problem as The Hangover 2; a sense that the sequel retreads the original without offering anything new or of any substance.

The short answer is, yes. A plot of staggering weakness and sublime silliness, varying wildly between maudlin sloppiness and utter mayhem, with holes sufficiently large to swallow an entire depot of London buses, laughable acting and the consumption of more ammunition than was used on D-Day. Now if you like fairy stories of the good guys coming out on top with barely a scratch and having massacred an entire battalion of nasties, then this is for you, but otherwise I'd recommend that you avoid.

The worrying thing is that there is left hanging in the plot the possibility of a ""Taken 3""... Given the enthusiasm of other reviewers, this could be a done deal.",1363910400,,817,4.595890410958904

The Taken series is definitely a bonafide good thrill ride that'll get your heart beating. If you've seen #1 it's more of the same in #2. Setting the movie in Istanbul was genius as well.

Well, you get Taken 2. Holy cow, what a mess. Given a different director and a slight re-write this movie would have been fantastic. There was so much there to work with, but the director had no idea what he was doing. My wife and I had to rewind almost every other scene because you couldn't tell where people were, what they were doing, or how they did it. The climax of the movie looked like Liam Neeson killed a guy by gently shoving his face. What?! After two rewinds we FINALLY saw that he had been impaled on something that was barely in the frame and you can't see until you look at it very carefully. We love action movies and we don't need to be spoon fed a narrative, but it REALLY helps when the shots actually show you what the heck is going on.

And on that note, hey, Oliver ""Megaton"" Fontana! It's called ""Shaky"" cam, not ""Donkey With Restless Leg Syndrome Is Kicking the Camera"" cam. And quick zooms don't work if that's all you do for two hours and the framing NEVER focuses on the subjects. Seriously, this guy would start already partially zoomed in to frame a character and then he would quick zoom so fast that the camera couldn't find the actor for 3-4 seconds, all the while we're looking at a car bumper or a blank wall. And when your shots only LAST 4 seconds max, that's an eternity of time in which we can't watch a movie because this guy obviously doesn't know how photography works. I did a count with about 30 minutes to go in the movie and I gave up after 10 minutes because there was exactly ONE scene in which he kept a shot going for longer than 3 seconds. Most of the shots only lasted half a second and then we're slammed into another angle, camera gyrating wildly, and then before we can focus, WHACK, we're in yet another shot. It's called pacing, ""Megaton"". This guy shouldn't be hired to do anything other than music videos or McDonalds ads. Then his complete lack of a clue wouldn't be as noticeable. This isn't a style, it's a desperate bid to use a camera technique to hide incompetence.

A quick word about the director's name. He calls himself Oliver Megaton. His real name is Oliver Fontana. If you have the arrogance to name yourself after a measurement for explosive force, then at least be sure you have the skill to back that mess up. This guy shouldn't call himself ""Megaton"". I've popped balloons that have more punch than his films.",1363305600,,2620,4.442827442827443

  Pretty good eh?  Taken 2 puts a different spin on the story, years after he rescues his daughter from human traffickers Neeson's character, Brian, is still just as anal as ever, but if you're seen the first one you know it's for good reasons.  This time the father of one of the kidnappers from the first movie (who doesn't care that his son was an international criminal, criminal or not that was his son) creates a plot to take vengeance of Brian and his entire family while they are vacationing overseas.  If you liked the first one, you'll love the character evolution of the second one.

The acting is good, and while the direction is not quite up to that of the first movie, the movie still works as intended  The storyline is basically the families of those killed in the first movie, want revenge in this one.  The locations used are interesting.

There is one blunder that doesn't detract from the movie, but whoever wrote the script, should have known better.  There is no US Embassy in Istanbul.  The US Embassy to Turkey is in Ankara, the country's capital.",1363219200,,638,4.633928571428571

If you rated the original as a 10(being fantastic), this would easily be a 6 or 7.  The acting was wonderful(Neeson turning in another stellar performance), and his co-stars were also great.  The bad guys were especially creepy, easily being as bad as the monsters in Taken.  Out of the more than 90 minutes of this movie, I'd say there was possibly 5 minutes where you weren't glued to your chair waiting for the next scene.

Of course, but viewer knows from the first frame the hero and his family will survive and bad guys will be vanquished, but we don't care BUT there is predictable and then there is PREDICTABLE like Taken 2.

Therefore, I was really looking forward to getting a second helping. Sadly, I could not have been more disappointed. This time around, the plot is pretty fill, and as a result, they just went with over the top action scenes that get annoying extremely fast.

A girl that can't pass her driving test all of a sudden can drive away from trained killers using a stick shift? A hostage that can measuring distance listening to the time between explosions? Really? The movie, may have a small redeeming factor with the entertainment, but that's all it is, SMALL, and not enough to give it more than one star.

Pretty much everything that was good about the first one got lost here. I guess it happens in many cases, but this one is one of the worst yet.

There was so much that should have been added to the story that was not. The family goes to another foreign country and the plot immediately begins to unfold. Terrorists are seeking revenge against the father after he rescued his daughter from the gang in France. As soon as the family arrives to this other country, they are immediately attacked.

4969257,3,B0067EKYDG,"""Taken 2"" is half just a fun action movie (if this is your idea of fun) and half an attempt at understanding CIA Nietzschean Superman -one dude anti kidnapping-killing machine Bryan Mills.  Keep in mind that in the first Taken--which possessed an eerie mood that made it stand out, along with Liam Neeson's sinister bravado--Bryan Mills rescued his daughter from Albanian kidnappers in less than 72 hours and singlehandedly dismantled the Albanian mob in about half an hour.

Not entirely so, it would seem.  In a slightly absurd plot device, Mills' daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, who is 30 and continues to play adolescents convincingly) and wife Lenore (Famke Jannsen) follow him to Istanbul, overwhelmed by enthusiasm because Kim has just learned to drive.

Well, as you might guess, they are ""Taken"".  An Albanian mob boss is determined to avenge the deaths of his young sons whom Mills killed in an attempt to get his daughter back.  Though his sons were scum, the mob boss does sort of seem sympathetic at times, chaining up Mills and confronting him with his own, well, misdeeds.  ""You connected my son Markos to an electrical current until his heart burst.  You killed these men like they were so many nothings.""  Mills knows why he did what he did, but you get the impression he's a bit more mellow by the end of the film.  Well, after about 300 deaths and car wrecks that Evil Kanevel would not have the remote chance of surviving.  This isn't up to the par of the original film, but if you noticed Bryan Mills, you'll want to see it anyway.",1362096000,,1548,4.696296296296296

4969390,3,B0067EKYDG,"This is the review. You have to focus. Don't let your eyes leave this page. The words on this webpage have the following meaning. Parallel parking's difficulty level is now far greater than the difficulty level of evading multiple Turkish police interceptors in the maze of streets in the centre of Istanbul (not Constantinople).

You have to pull yourself together now, and finish reading this review. As long as your father is there in the passenger seat commanding you in short, staccato word-bursts, you can drive a Mercedes 5-speed taxicab through narrow twisting alleys and never miss a gear. Keep going.

I'll bet you never knew the U.S. Embassy in Istanbul was located at the centre of a maze of twisting streets and narrow alleys. It's turns out that's where the U.S. likes to locate its embassies, at least in majority-Islamic countries: far from the airport, in the midst of the city where there are the tightest, narrowest streets, where you can't see what's up ahead of the motorcade too well, and with lots of irregular architecture on either side; lots of good routes for escorting those important diplomats to and from the airport.

You know, ""Taken 2"" had my interest, as did the much better first in the ""Taken"" franchise. But then it got silly. And I started to laugh a lot more than I should've. ""Taken 3"" should be the story of Kim (Maggie Grace) dating this young Albanian-American guy whose family aren't killers, slavers, or kidnappers (they own a shop that sells designer clothes); that'll be good for some dramatic tension between the boyfriend and the Bryan Mills character. And then Kim and her boyfriend get taken by some vengeance-minded Americans who've decided they've had enough with Albanians kidnapping people all over the world. And then Bryan and Lenore Mills get taken by a group of Albanians who mistake them for the previously mentioned Americans who kidnapped Kim and her boyfriend, whom the Albanians are trying to rescue. And then THOSE Albanians get kidnapped by a group of Chuvash villagers from north of the Volga River. The Chuvash villagers then hire a highly trained group of Faroe Islands natives whose specialty is abduction, to kidnap themSELVES, and the entire story is told backwards, with all the scenes in reverse order. Christopher Nolan will direct.

""Taken 2"" is good for what it's supposed to be: a movie with a lot of action. Car action. Gun action. Hand-to-hand combat action.  It's just hard to take any of it seriously. The first one had the advantage of that premise that clearly sells a lot of movies: (deep voice) they %#*!ed with the wrong man. Also, moviegoers seem to take a degree of perverse pleasure in seeing innocence get threatened, as long as those doing the threatening of innocence are horrifyingly punished and killed later on in the film. ""Taken 2"" it's like... nobody cares if Mr. and Mrs. Mills get kidnapped. They're not innocent, playful ingnues with hearts of gold, facing an horrific fate that would make the strongest person blanch with terror.

But hey, the performers need to take a bow, because they never falter in their honest portrayals of these made-up characters. Their conviction is perfect, even when things get silly. In ""Taken 1"" Maggie Grace had to create a convincing, true to life persona out of the rawest human emotions (extreme excitement/happiness and extreme terror) and succeeded admirably. In ""Taken 2"" she plays the clich part of ""18 year-old girl in love for the first time"" like a real, live person and Not a clich; matured by her ordeals, but still a bit of a romantic and starlet-wannabe. She turns in a better, more varied performance here than she did as the San Fernando Valley clich in ""Taken 1.""

And can anyone think of anything bad to say about Famke Janssen or Rade Serbedzija? If so, those people had best not come near me, for I have several choice words I would fain share with such people.

And no matter how bad a movie gets, I will not, I will Never diss Admiral Zeus from Planet Krull. The man is a genius. I wish I had even a fraction of this man's genius. Watch the very last scene of ""Taken 2"" for a bit of this man's infective genius. Thanks, Liam.

Similar plot,great action,etc.. Is it better than the first 1 that is up to u, but it will be in my collection and i don't buy movies that are not as good as the 1st in my opinion. I highly recommend renting it first so u don't waist ur money if u don't like it just like u should with any movie.

4969454,2,B0067EKYDG,"I don't think the plot is necessarily bad I just feel that the pacing was off.  You basically have the annoying daughter (who doesn't look ANYWHERE near a high schooler) running the show for at least 30 minutes and it's extremely tedious.  I mean they have this chick basically playing a 16 year old (she's getting ready for her driver's test) and she's double the age in real life (29 as I looked it up).  Not feasible and the rest of the story is just as unfeasible.  It is incredibly annoying...incredibly.

Not only that but the writer or director thought it was brilliant for this ""teenager"" to chuck grenades at rooftops (and cars) in a foreign country.  I know it's fiction but it's not supposed to be in a fictional reality where you won't get shot in a foreign country essentially committing acts of wanton violence on the population.  I can suspend reality just like everyone else but not in a ""realistic"" movie.

Anyway, first half is boring, second half is better because they shelf the daughter for a while; ending is dumb and (again) doesn't make much sense.  These cardboard characters don't act like human beings even neeson's character (yeah...""Let's leave our teenage daughter who was previously kidnapped in a foreign country in a hotel in a foreign country while we go shopping!  Great idea!""  Idiotic writing and it probably made money, don't give them anymore of your money.",1361577600,,1396,4.775

""we shall make him pay for protecting his young innocent dauther from my criminal son.  pack your things mohammed's 1 through 20, let's go avenge akbar!!!!""  mindless entertainment.",1361577600,,450,5.208333333333333
4969488,2,B0067EKYDG,"I loved ""Taken,"" the original movie starring Liam Neeson. Very much like the ""Bourne"" series, it was exciting and somewhat plausible. This movie was weak on many levels and stretched logic far beyond reasonable limits. If I was being constantly hunted by foreign terrorists, even in the relative safety of my own U.S. cities, why in the world would I take my wife and daughter to some place like Istanbul? You just know from the minute he suggests such a trip that someone will be kidnapped or killed. How about a ski trip to Colorado instead?

Yes there are some exciting fight scenes, shootouts, and car chases - but even those scenes become boring and ridiculously implausible. A woman has her throat cut and is then hung upside down. She is left like that, dripping copious amounts of blood while gun battles, fights, and car chases take place all over the city. When she is rescued, she is revived in just minutes, has little or no blood on her hair or clothes, and is able to converse and even run along with her rescuer.

Sorry - I love Neeson - but after a while the eastern European terrorists all begin to look alike, talk with the same accent, and even being 20 years younger, can not outfight a man twice their age who has already been wounded, bruised, battered, and tortured for hours. Neeson can do much better than this.",1361577600,,1336,4.5625
4969489,1,B0067EKYDG,"I was really surprised by the first movie when it came out because it was an above average thriller with some great action. The first movie did a great job of setting the stakes so that the viewer felt more involved in the action which allows a certain suspense of disbelief. This film is just plain bad from the acting to the editing and everything in between, as someone who owns the original Taken on Bluray, I had a hard time finishing this one.",1361577600,,449,4.357142857142857

4969491,1,B0067EKYDG,"The first Taken was better. This was a very shallow plot. The characters are developed just enough to make us think we care about them and then the bad guys go after them. The whole movie is the good guys being terrorized by the bad guys as the good guys shoot everyone in Istanbul. They crash every car in the city too. The daughter's lines were easy for her to remember.  ""Dad!""  Leam Neeson's lines are, ""listen carefully.""",1361577600,,426,4.448717948717949

4969495,5,B0067EKYDG,"Liam just keeps getting better with age and I felt that this movie was a tad bit better then the first. Having said that I liked the first too. The fight scenes were a little better choreographed,(slower)and it seems they took some pages from the tried and true formula of the Bourne series. Even the music had that same urgent feel. I loved the way he talked his daughter through his own rescue even though some of it was a bit of a stretch the point was well taken. I believe this young lady has a good career ahead of her. Maybe they are setting her up for something in the future. I probably should have given this a four star rating but the set up was good, good scenery and locations, and it did keep your attention and raise apprehension at the outcome. Edge of your seat type stuff.  I really like Liam in this type of role as an operative. Five stars because it's Liam man!",1361491200,,882,4.25
4969496,1,B0067EKYDG,"This movie nearly, but not quite, attains the status of accidental satire. The script is so absolutely dire - based on the classic five-second pitch ""hey, what if this time round the parents are the ones who get taken and the kid has to save them?"" - that you want everyone to die within the first ten minutes just to get it all over with. Alas, this doesn't happen and so Neeson - a decent actor who deserves much better scripts, roles, and everything else than this - ponderously plods his way through one inept plot device to the next. There's one genuinely accidentally funny line when the Neeson character tells his daughter, who's in an expensive hotel room in downtown Istanbul, via a mini phone ""Take a grenade. Remove the pin. Now, throw it somewhere safe.""

Aside from that one brief moment, the rest of the movie is so turgid, so absolutely lacking in imagination, pacing, drama, and everything else that it is quite impossible to understand why the crew bothered to show up each day to make the movie - unless the crew were Turkish and didn't speak English and therefore didn't understand just how truly bad this pathetic movie-by-numbers is.

Avoid at all costs unless you're desperately insomniac.",1361491200,,1211,4.734597156398104

Of course, many things are just ridiculous in both movies but so are many other great movies.",1361491200,,380,4.686567164179104
4969520,4,B0067EKYDG,"Taken was a fantastic movie and set the bar high for Taken 2.

Unfortunately, Taken 2, while having some great moments, is one of those sequels that has that 'this is obviously a sequel' feel to it.  There was some decent story, with a fair amount of action, but it in no way lives up to it's predecessor.  Liam Neeson does a great job regardless, which is probably what pushes me to give this movie 4 stars instead of 3.  It's a sequel with some great action scenes, some occasional bad writing, and some horrible camera angles.

This is one of those movies where you definitely wouldn't regret it if you only just rented it, yet you wouldn't feel horrible for spending $20 on the blu-ray either.

4969655,2,B0067EKYDG,"I was looking for a movie to rent today, and I spotted this sequel to a movie I had watched years ago and enjoyed.  Since it still had the lead actor, Liam Neeson, I assumed that it would be a decent sequel.  Usually, it is the ones that re-cast the film that you have to worry about.  I actually had to stop and wonder to myself as to how they would be able to continue the storyline.  I was under the impression that the first movie had cleared up all of the loose ends.

The writer(s) of the sequel chose a tie-in idea that was plausible, despite my initial worries, but the details when it came to translating the idea into a quick introduction scene to the film were very weak.  I found myself unable to suspend disbelief, despite reminding myself that this is Hollywood; it was just that poor of an execution.

My hopes lifted once the movie started proper, and we had dialog from the actors, but it did a slow nosedive through until the end for me.  By the time I had gotten halfway through the movie, I was beginning to lose interest in the specifics of the story.  Thankfully, the action scenes were sufficient to keep me awake, despite being over the top and thus unrealistic.

(Possible spoiler) In my opinion, the worst part of the movie was the car chase scene.  It featured one character driving a car and a second character riding in the passenger seat.  The car was attempting to elude the bad guys and the police who were chasing them through these tiny streets of Istanbul.  The first problem was that the driver did not have a drivers licence because they could not even figure out how to parallel park.  Yet here they were navigating these tiny streets at full throttle, using advanced techniques such as using the emergency brake to power slide and drift around corners?  The second problem was the passenger was yelling the following three things over and over again: Keep low! (they were being shot at), Faster, faster!, Do it!.  He must have repeated the same lines at least five times in the short car chase.  To make things worse, the driver responded to each line with I cant! I cant.  I felt like I was in some kind of demented time warp!

The movie ended with a Hallmark moment straight out of 50s television show endings.  Sappy and cheesy.  To add salt to the wound, the story left open an avenue for a third movie to branch off from, so I wouldnt be surprised to see another sequel in the future.  Sad, but not surprised.

All in all, the movie was not the worst way to spend an hour and a half, but I certainly won't be recommending this one to my friends and family or watching it again in the future.",1361145600,,2635,4.387628865979382

However, the movie as a whole is very entertaining and well worth the two hours to view. It speeds along nicely without letting yourself get bogged down with details. Much of that comes during the movie and if you're paying attention, will make more sense. Movie sorta takes up where Taken left off, with a little revenge plot and the two ""families"" collide giving the viewer a wild ride through some pretty nasty looking areas (if those really exist). Funny though, there's only one segment with the local police (car chase) but when the shooting starts, they aren't to be found.

1. No no its fine. Just go throw these grenades all over the city. It won't hurt anybody.
2. You have failed your driving test twice?? No problem ... you will be perfect driving a stick shift in narrow streets of a foreign country ... you will leave the cops driving their 1970s cop cars behind in no time.
3. When I yell 'Faster, faster' during car chase you yell back 'I cant I cant'. We will repeat this like 20 times while cutting to quick shots of gear changes.
4. Oh and just drive right through the US Consulate barricades ... they are just soldiers .. they will move out of the way. Then I will make a call to a golf playing buddy in US and ask him to tell the soldiers all the way in Istanbul to not shoot us. We will be A OK!!!!
5. So since mozlems are the bad guys lets just reinforce that stereotype over and over and over. Tell the world Albania is a muslim country and muslims are bad? check. Shots of mosques? check. Shots of covered women head to toe staring down the liberated woman from west? check. Shots of calls for prayers while the bad guys roll in for their attack? check. Portray the lead muslim villian as backstabbing coward? check. The list goes on!!
6. Lets tie up the man that killed so many bad guys in Taken 1 with just a tie wrap .... while we tie his wife down with chains!!!!
7. After doing #6 make sure everybody leaves them alone with plenty of time to you know ... escape!!

The list goes on just like the gazillion quick camera cuts during action sequences. This movie will become the 'how not to edit a movie' movie.",1361059200,2,1573,4.2052980132450335

Not as much shooting and no guy left being electrocuted, but the story actually fit well with the original and was not far fetched at all. It did not seem like they were reaching for something at all. Very well done on that end, and as much as I enjoyed the first, I still think the action in this one is better.

4969720,2,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 is a typical sequel that does not match the quality of the original.  Liam Neeson does his choreographed kung pao-fuey well and kills plenty of bad guys again, but the movie fails in other respects.  First, in one scene he and his daughter (with her driving too well for someone still without a driver's license) burst into the courtyard of the US Embassy in Istanbul in a stolen Mercedes taxi seeking refuge from a group of bad guys chasing them.  Apparently in the movie, the embassy has no vehicle barriers and no strong gate, and a taxi can take multiple hits from 50 cal. machine guns fired by a handful of guards and keep going.  Second, after bursting onto the embassy grounds, Maggie Grace's character disappears from almost the rest of the movie only to reappear briefly back in Los Angeles at the end of the movie.  Third, after they burst onto the embassy grounds, Neeson's character is suddenly shown roaming the streets of Istanbul again in search of his wife.  How did he get out of the embassy so quickly even after shooting a Turkish cop during the car chase?  That is not shown.  The story suddenly jumps there.

Taken 2 is a waste of money since several elements of the story are nonsense.  The same care was not taken with the sequel as with the original.  Everyone involved in the movie seems to have shown up to simply collect a paycheck.  Liam Neeson does not even say his trademark line as well as in the original.",1361059200,6,1445,4.515384615384615

4969724,3,B0067EKYDG,"I truly enjoyed the first ""Taken"".  I am a big fan of Liam Neeson, and I loved seeing him mix it up with the ""baddies"" in the first film.  I was perfectly content to overlook the fact that not one of about a gazillion bullets hit their mark when the bad guys were firing. (see Arnold, Sly, etc.)  It was suspenseful, the action scenes were well crafted, and I felt that I had spent my money wisely when I purchased that first movie.  Why am I spending time reliving the first movie?  Well, the second movie was just about a carbon copy of the first one!  Now, I understand that they intentionally wished to use the formula that worked so well in ""Taken"", but I thought they were just a tad bit insulting by asking us to sit through another movie that should have rather been titled ""Taken 1.1""!  I gave the movie three stars because it was still fun to watch, and because I like watching guys my age (60'ish) appear invincible!",1360972800,,927,4.323699421965318

4969726,3,B0067EKYDG,"This film does little more than fortify the Hollywood tradition (clich) of the sequel.  Sure, there have been anomalies, but too many, like this, are [censored by Amazon].  The actors are of course quite good -- in other films.  That would include the original Taken, but let's not delude ourselves, it was significantly shy of being anything more than a chunk of entertainment with at least one relatively memorable scene.  BTW, was anyone looking for a Palme d'Or candidate in this one?  I admit that I was looking for a minor escape, but found myself watching the time, waiting for it to be over.  So, am I comparing this film to the experience of a difficult bowel movement?  Well, all I can really say is that the auteur responsible for Transporter 3 owes me, that's right.  Aside from being a waste of my cash, potentially solid performances, great locales, etc., were likewise squandered in a vapid exercise.  If you're r-e-a-l-l-y interested in these characters, I'd wait until it shows up as a bargain rental (or on Netflix ;).  I actually apologize, Olivier Megaton!  I might have blown my title (and some other statements) out of proportion -- much like the ads for this movie, as I recall.  It was, at best, a mild BM.  Salut.",1360972800,,1238,4.702325581395349

Yes, he's supposed to be this highly trained, well-prepared operative, but he seemed to breeze through a decently sized opposing force with barely any trouble.  I also wish they had perhaps substituted another character for his ex-wife because she really didn't serve a purpose except to keep Neeson's character fighting just a bit longer.  Considering she hardly had any dialogue and spent most of the film incapacitated it would have been better perhaps if they had fleshed out someone Neeson's character was supposed to be protecting and have them be abducted alongside, giving more depth to his supposed background since we never really see him protecting people other than his family except in small increments.",1360972800,,999,4.796511627906977

4969774,3,B0067EKYDG,"The original ""Taken"" was a fast paced, riveting revenge flick that offered brief entertainment, provided you could look past its bizarre flaws (the primary one being a rather racist tone). This sequel contains some of what made the first movie good- Liam Neeson is a hardcore BA, conveying a sense of authentic, lethal ability that is achieved through wisdom and experience, as opposed to high flying kicks and theatrics. All of his combat techniques are ugly, as opposed to being choreographed for beauty, and therefore feel grounded in reality. Neeson's performance is quite good, for the most part, though even he can't erase some particularly bad lines of dialogue that were written for him (a tradition that was established in the original ""Taken"").

This movie could have succeeded, but it suffers from a plot that is so disjointed, it's downright weird. It's almost as if the writers were just phoning it in on this one, so as to have the means to create another revenge movie. Nothing wrong with that, necessarily, but it's so disjointed, it almost feels surreal... like the characters are stumbling around in a dream. ""Taken 2"" offers some moderate entertainment for an hour and a half, benefiting from some decent action sequences and the presence of Neeson, but it ultimately proves forgettable. It is, unfortunately, a pale imitator of the original, and watching it only made me wish that I had spent that time watching the first ""Taken"" again, or something else entirely.",1360800000,,1484,5.008097165991903

The action is not as unintelligible as some reviews said, just a little rotoscoping or something. Not half as bad as the shaky Bourne crap.

Kind of clever how the dad narrows down his location, even if it does involve the insane and irresponsible use of multiple grenades. It's all just silly fun (with guns), although his wife is terrorized for most of it.

Technically they might work, but in a seat of your pants, gun to the head, package to the wall scenario, not likely. That's why it's a movie. Again, Liam Neesom holds his own, plugging away with a solid heart and fists of iron.

This time around mom and dad are kidnapped and daughter Kimy is much wiser for the wear, effectively carrying out dads detailed and edgy plans for survival. Istanbul is the locale which doesn't add much atmosphere to the harrowing chases yet it still helps give a desperate gloominess to the film. Many people liked the first film and this time around the idea was to touch on the original elements, then quickly set up a premise that makes diving into the action an easy transition.

I got the same thrilling ""hows this gonna work out"" feel I got from the first Taken and thats okay with me. Taken 2 is fun and exciting escapism that you can't look at with too critical an eye. Basically, enjoy the ride.",1360540800,,1029,4.410526315789474
4969945,3,B0067EKYDG,"There are two types of sequels in Hollywood - the ones that get made because there's more story to tell and the ones that get made because the first film made a lot of money. At first Taken seemed like it was getting a sequel because it made a bunch of money - but in fact Taken 2 had a good enough idea behind it that I felt there was easily more good story to be told. With the premise of the families of the bad guys in the first film going on an offensive to get back at Bryan Mills was excellent! This premise gives both sides of the conflict the same motivation of protecting their families - which is universal and pretty cool for an action film premise.

The problem is with Mills' entire family in peril - the director keeps the viewer in touch with the family throughout - so we lose that sense of urgency that the first film provided. In the first film we don't see his daughter after she's kidnapped - and it's intense throughout the film because we don't know what's happening to his daughter. This lack of suspense really takes one of the best elements that made the first film such a hit and replaces it with action sequences which suffer due to the lack of urgency and suspense. It's a big problem - there should've been another element added to replace the lack of suspense problem - as just action cannot fix this.

FYI - This paragraph has nothing to do with the movie itself. I think - the bad guys should've just hired another assassin to get Mills and have it become more of a Die Hard, Bourne film cat and mouse game between Mills and an equally talented bad guy. We would've known Mills could win - but since we hadn't already seen him succeed in this kidnap scenario before the intensity needed to be amped up in a different way by taking Mills out of his element a bit. They need someone who can challenge Bryan Mills' level of preparedness so the viewer could feel like they are seeing something worth the ""certain set of skills"" Mills has.

Anyway - the action was good (not great) Luc Besson knows how to orchestrate a good action film and Olivier Megaton is a solid director for action films - the pacing felt a little stop-start but it wasn't egregious. Overall the film lacked what could've been a great sequel based on the story needing to be expanded and made it feel like a sequel that was out for more cash.

The bar was set high - by surprisingly excellent action romp that was Taken and Taken 2 (like many Eastern European thugs) got its head bashed into the bar by Liam Neeson.",1360540800,,2516,4.3241525423728815

While not quite as good as the first film which blew on the scene somewhat unexpectantly, ""Taken 2"" still manages to be breezy entertainment with Liam Neeson dong what he does best in action films--beating the bad guys at their own game.

SPOILERS:

While in Istanbul ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Neeson), his ex-wife (Famke Janssen--somebody give this underrated actress another film with some substance--please!) are kidnapped by the father (Rade Serbedzija)of one of the men he killed in the first movie. Mills must rely on his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace who, at 27, is getting a wee bit too old for these roles)to help him escape and rescue his wife.

END OF SPOILERS:

""Taken 2"" certainly doesn't break any new ground and it's not the unexpected back-to-basics thriller that the first one was but it's enjoyable on its own terms. The action sequences are well directed although this film, unlike the first, seems a bit like all the other recent action thrillers released in terms of staging and stunts. The editing is a bit more choatic, again, much like most of the other action films we've seen over the last decade and while does a adequate job, he lacks the flair of Pierre Morel who made the first film.

Having said that, it is tough to direct a sequel to a popular film like ""Taken"" because the expectations the first film (which came as a bit of a surprise to many) aren't there. ""Taken 2"" is still fun particularly as a mindless way to spent a rainy afternoon or if you're at home sick.

The blu-ray looks particularly nice particularly some of the beautifully shot establishing shots of L.A. and Istanbul. Detail is abundant and there's quite a bit of detail evident in this crisp presentation of the film.

The audio is equally impressive with a nice, immersive soundtrack with dialogue STILL remaining clear. We get a variety of subtitles for the film including English, Spanish and, of all things, Mandarin.

The special features includes a ""Black Ops Field Manual"" (this is only available on the unrated version) which acts as a clever pop up option with background info on the film.

We also get deleted scenes and alternate ending that provides an interesting, slightly different taste to the conclusion of the film.

We can also browse through Mills' weapons case and learn about each one.

""In Character with Liam Neeson"" is from FX Movie Channel and is a fluff piece where the actor discusses his character.

We also get the theatrical trailer and, for those using BD Live, Fox gives them an exclusive making of featurette which I didn't watch.

Is ""Taken 2"" a worthwhile investment to buy? That depends on how much of a fan of this film you are. It certainly is entertaining and engaging.

If you're in doubt perhaps a rental would be the first best choice. I know I might pick this up when the price drops just because I enjoy Neeson's performance as Mills and it really is a fun action thriller.",1360368000,,3041,4.734848484848484

I will be the first to tell you that a sequel is not going to be better than the first, but this has got to be one of the best sequels of the last 10 years or so. I can honestly tell you that I would put it evenly with Taken 1. This is probably because at the beginning of the movie they made sure to make it have as much character development as the first movie. It really felt like they wanted to truly continue the story of what would happen to a family after the events of the first movie had taken place, and they even brought back the entire supporting cast from the first. They didn't just try to put more explosives and more action and less character development which is the mold that 99% of sequels seem to take.

With his tall, muscular physique and weathered facial features (move over, Daniel Craig, not that you're not a great actor),
Neeson continued successfully with Unknown, The Grey and now Taken 2.

Prior to watching a film, movie goers ought to have a mind set.
We pick up Taken 2 mostly because we liked Taken 1 or action films.
We also should not be expecting Taken 2 to be superior to Taken 1.

Taken 2 seems to have a bigger budget than Taken 1 and enjoyed top box office when first released in the theatres.
The long sequences of the daughter trying to find the kidnapped father and the newly licensed daughter driving through
the narrow busy streets and alleys of Istanbul and the final bear knuckle fist fight between one of the henchmen and Neeson

It's slow.
It's boring.
... and then comes the action... which sucked.

Apparently now what Liam does best is share his feelings because these action sequences looked like they were executed by an old man way past his prime.  Even when he runs, it looks like he is on his way to a weight watcher's meeting.

The action sequences are choppy and don't show any good hits or stunts. The car chase is about the only action sequence that has merit.. other than the fact that some girl with no driver's license performs top notch maneuver's in a city she has never visited...  other than that.

Spoiler Alert!  Bruce Willis drops in on the last scene, kills everyone, then walks away smoking a cigarette.

Oh wait, that might have actually made it a watchable movie.

Ok, Taken was a great action movie.  It was fresh, it was action packed, and it starred a formidable character, the former CIA Agent Bryan Mills.  While the sequel isn't as good (very few sequels are), it's good at what it's meant for - a vicious, unrelenting action/revenge movie.

Bryan Mills has just finished an assignment in Istanbul, when his ex-wife Lenore (who's having marriage problems with her current rich husband) and his daughter Kim, surprise him at the hotel.  The movie gets crazy quick, as family members from the slain Albanians from the first film attempt to snatch all three.  They succeed with Bryan and Lenore but fail to snatch Kim, due to a call from Bryan.

Through guiding Kim, Bryan is able to help her aid in his escape, fight his way through bad guys, and so the movie goes.  It culminates after an hour of fist-fights and more gunplay with a great Krav Maga-style fight between Bryan Mills and the right-hand man of Murad, the Albanian Mob Boss.  Bryan then confronts and kills Murad, and leaves with Lenore to rejoin Kim.

For plot, the movie feels less effective than its predecessor, but for action, it is well-paced and enough to serve its purpose as an action movie.",1359849600,,1227,4.723004694835681

4970448,2,B0067EKYDG,"Being a huge fan of the first Taken, I was extremely skeptical of how the sequel would turn out. Knowing how Hollywood works, if there is a formula that works, Hollywood would take the liberty and try to milk the cow until it completely dries up. The original Taken (although not a  perfect film) was a great action thriller that had a simple premise but also had characters that were entertaining to watch thanks to the leading role of Liam Neeson.  The first film was about one man practically going against an entire army, going through whatever it takes to save his kidnapped daughter. Yes it was a very simple plot, but personally I found the execution to be thoroughly entertaining to watch.  The action was stellar, the scenarios were well thought out and most importantly you were watching the movie to the very end to make sure Liam Neeson's character does save his daughter.

4 years later comes the release of Taken 2, the direct sequel. One thing I did appreciate about Taken 2 was the fact that the story didn't pull off a ""Hangover 2"" and just recreate the same movie in a different location. The plot, although familiar, was actually well thought out, and I believe that whomever took the time to write Taken 2 really thought of the best possible way to connect this film and the first Taken.  HOWEVER, what went wrong was simply the way the film was executed. The execution was very poor to say the very least and the director of this film should be ashamed of himself. Just about everything that made the first Taken so great, has suffered immensely in this second film. The only thing that saves this film from being absolute trash was the presence of Liam Neeson, but even he wasn't in top form. The acting from everybody including the great Liam Neeson felt incredibly flat; I just didn't feel the same sense of urgency as I did watching the first film which is awful because this movie is labeled as a thriller. The action sequences were horrid as well; I was glad I didn't catch this in the theaters because I am 100% sure that all the shaky fight scenes would have given me a headache. None of the villains in this movie were memorable whatsoever, I couldn't tell one guy from the other with the exception of the father of the sons Liam Neeson killed in the first movie, but I just didn't find him menacing, just annoying.

As I am a fan of the first film, I found that Taken 2 was without a doubt an unnecessary movie that should not have been released. There were few instances where I found that the film succeeded as far as the plot, mainly in the middle of the film where Liam Neeson was instructing his daughter on how to find the location of him and her mother, but ultimately those scenes could not justify an entire 90 minutes of film. The film felt rushed and the acting was not done well at all; maybe if it was directed by a different person the film would've turned out decent but sadly this is what we have to settle with.",1359849600,,2959,4.450184501845018
4970449,3,B0067EKYDG,"The main plot idea was perfectly reasonable if not a little predicable.  Shortly after Taken 1 the family of the Albanian mobsters that were previously killed go out for revenge and this time the whole family is involved.  It was a mindless action flick, and I wasn't bored while watching it.  Unfortunately this sequel lacked a lot of what made the first one good enough to warrant a sequel in the first place.

Firstly, I found the settings very limited.  Where the first movie felt like it ranged all over Paris, with LN having to work for every clue, this one just had LN chasing someone down one dirty ally or hallway after another.  The action scenes also followed the recent trend of shaking the camera like a martini and shooting disjointed and unrelated things to add a sense of action, then over-using jump cuts to splice the mess back together.

A lot of the plot specifics didn't add up or were too convenient to be believable.  I won't ruin it by running them down specifically here.  Let's just say that unless you think a teenager can drive a cab though barricades and several 50 caliber machine guns to break into a US embassy, an LA girl struggling for normalcy that just narrowly escaped sex-slavery in France will want to travel to Istanbul to ""get away"", or villains will always do the cliche ""I'm just going to leave you alone now in a locked room by yourself even though I know you've single-handily killed all my previous men"" then you might have plot issues with this movie too.

One last nit-pick...who ever directed the lighting of this movie must have thought all of Istanbul uses cheap, dim, green-casting florescent lights inside.

Other than all that LN and FJ were good as always, and it was nice FJ had a bigger role in this one.  I just wish I had waiting for the rental to be cheaper or to go free/prime before I watched it, and unlike the first one, I probably won't be watching this one again ever.",1359849600,,1934,4.525862068965517

4970540,4,B0067EKYDG,"Apart from the movie I don't know what's going on with the trailers of these movies recently. They have shots of things that aren't even in the movie themselves, and they are misleading into thinking the plot is way different than when I actually see the movie.
  Anyway I loved taken. We've watched it so many times! This film also rocked too, but I thought it was going to be about his daughter saving the parents. Like somehow she's some revved up karate secret agent because her dad trained her but it wasn't. Fast-paced, entertaining, good backstory (building off the first film), nice plot and I also liked the romance plot they introdcued!
  I however did not like how fast they changed from frame to frame. That's one of the main reasons i liked the first film so much was because it was so action packed and fast paced from scene to scene but in this sequel they change camera angles so fast it actually gave me a headache. THey figured with the success of the first one ""what will happen if we even go faster and double the shot to shot timeframe."" LEt me tell you I don't like it. Other than that it just left a sort of half-a$$'d feeling . Or not the bang i wanted. They just need to make liam more bad @33 and messing everyone up.

4970578,2,B0067EKYDG,"On first inspection it would seem that Luc Besson runs a factory these days that dispenses one action movie after another. He has a stable of directors, cameramen, composers, editors, etc. that go from one product to another. there is a lack of imagination these days coming from the man behind the Fifth Element and the Professional, two great films that were more than a decade ago.
 Besson's latest director to hand films off to for assembly seems to be one Olivier Megatron, who helmed the mundane Transporter 3 and last year's excruciatingly dull Columbiana. To say that Taken 2 is his best effort so far isn't as much of a compliment as it sounds, it's more like stating a fact with little zeal.
 Taking place soon after the events of 2008's Taken, this time around the retired splenetic CIA man Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is vacating in Istanbul, Turkey when his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) and ex-wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), pull a surprise appearance. At the same time, the family of the cast of villains from the first movie come looking for some settling of scores. The new crop of Albanian heavies are led by Murad (Rade Serbedzja), the father of one of Neeson's targets the first time around.
 Mills and Lenore are taken hostage, while Kim searches for them. A sort of reversal of events from the last time around. Eventually, Mills escapes with his daughter's help and some handy grenades. He plots his own mission of ruthless revenge and retribution.
 Like it's predecessor, there is a lot of slick action here, everything is fairly neat and tidy, probably too much so. The action sequences are well staged, but there is an over emphasis on quick cut editing to assist the 60 year-old Nesson get through his physical work, that leaves the audience a little nauseated and dazed. Suspense is built through the menacing score by Nathanel Mechaly and the chases scenes are enhanced by solid editing. The camerawork from Besson regular Romain Lacourbas is decent, but workman like. They are also enough car crashes her to make Burt Reynolds salivate. I guess the anonymous stunt drivers should get some credit, good job guys.
 Once again the whole show really is Liam Neeson, an actor too good for this sort of material which he seems to do a lot of now, but he adds dignity and enhances what is essentially a 21st century Charles Bronson role. He works his way through some awkward situations and recycled dialogue from the first movie, but handles it with class that makes this more a pleasure to watch than it really deserves to be. Neeson, should get some better roles soon though, if he wishes to avoid following Nicolas Cage's poor example.
 Maggie Grace is unfortunately just too old for this role, she was too old the first time around, here she is really too old, like Channing Tatum-Jonah Hill too old. She's supposed to still be in high school and studying for her driving exam, but looks to be in her mid twenties. I usually don't complain about such things, except in cases like this where it becomes distracting. She also seems a little more awkward with her acting than before, perhaps because her character is so underwritten that she comes across as a little less than a half-wit.
 And poor Rade Serbedzja, a Serbian leading man and a fine actor, who is sadly given very little to do in a movie such as this. Much like the first go around, Taken 2 suffers from the lack of a strong central villain. There are plenty of anonymous badies for Neeson to off, but no one to create a real lasting impression. Action and thrillers are often made by a strong antagonist, think how James Bond movies are often defined by their villains.
 Famke Janssen, like last time, is again strictly window dressing.
 Megatron would appear to be the least of the filmmakers working in the Besson group these days, which makes it rather peculiar that he would place such an important title as Taken 2 in his clearly incapable hands. At least Pierre Morel, director of the previous movie had reasonably impressive skills at storytelling and greater strength in his dynamics.
 The script written by Besson and his frequent collaborator Robert Mark Karmen, who also wrote the first movie, is nothing to great either. Plodding and rehashing the original film a whole lot, when they aren't reusing situations and even dialogue, they at times resort to flashbacks.
 Overtly stylish like it's popular, but somewhat overrated predecessor, the Taken movies aim for a macho toughness like action pics of the past, but allow themselves to be undone by their anemic bloodletting and safe for mass consumption PG-13 violence, even in the unrated version. These movies lack the edge that it so desperately desires.
 Yet, at a well paced and reasonable length of ninety-two minutes, everything moves at a fast enough pace to forgive much of it's short comings, which there are many.  Taken 2 fails to make us care much about the characters or events on screen, but keeps us reasonable entertain none the less. But let it be known that where the first movie was an old song played at a different tempo, this time around it's strictly a cover version.

This movie picked right up where that one left off basically.
It wasn't very exciting in the beginning, but it picked up. Lots of guns and blowing things up!!
Liam Neeson plays a bad ass C.I.A. agent that knows some really creative ways of escaping captivity. That alone made the film worth watching. Total genius I tell you.
The bad guys never stop chasing Liam either, so there is room in the end for a third film.",1359417600,,523,4.402061855670103
4970586,2,B0067EKYDG,"Liam Neeson has to be, by far, the worst vacation partner in the history of... ever. Taken, Taken 2, The Grey, Unknown, should I go on? With that aside, the plot of this movie and the constant camera changes during car rides with his daughter caused me so much disinterest that I ended up having a very productive email session on my phone. This movie could have been better, Liam Neeson is a great actor, but they just forced the heck out of this plot.

*Liam Neeson pulls up to his daughters house to take her driving* *waits 30 seconds, camera shifts 5,402 times between his eyes, watch, car clock, ignition key, brakes, foot, mosquito, ice cream truck, subliminal advertising for Toyata, alien space crafts, the house, a still shot of the director, etc.* - I'm exaggerating, but if you saw this movie you'd be inclined to agree with me. The action shots aren't bad... during action scenes, but the whole movie tried to put on big boy action movie pants when the only thing I wanted was a still shot of 2 people talking.

If there's a Taken 3, I wouldn't watch it if you tied me to a chair and had Taken 3 on one screen and a Tyler Perry movie on the other.",1359417600,,1160,4.3657407407407405

4970636,5,B0067EKYDG,"If you enjoyed the first movie ""Taken "" then this one will also be enjoyable to watch. Liam Neeson turns in yet another splendid performance. Although i never was a great Neeson fan and followed all of his movies, i have become a avid follower of his films and acting. I can only remember the amazing "" Schindlers List "" which seemed like so many years ago now, but Mr Neeson never fails to come through and his choices of scripts can never be faulted.
Unfortunately for some inexplicable reason Liam Neeson in my humble opinion never seems to get the full credit for his acting abilities and should be billed head and shoulders above many of the Hollywood male actors that appear in movies today. He is vastly under-appreciated..once again, just my humble opinion.

Great action sequences with Liam Neeson as the likeable, yet vulnerable hero. There's no plot give away here, but his ex-wife gets captured this time and Liam has to find her before time runs out.

Essentially being the same story I liked the first movie better. They did do a good job of carrying the story over making a natural transition from one movie to the next. They tied the two together throughout the sequel.

If you haven't seen either, then start with the first one; better character development. If you liked the first one, this is a good popcorn flick.",1359331200,,721,4.538461538461538

Both movies feature some pretty good action, fight scenes and chase scenes. The story line, again, is not impressive. If you want some mindless testosterone, this movie is just what you want. If you want a script that you can't predict the story, that has a compelling story line, well, keep looking. This isn't it.

My wife and I watched this, neither was impressed.",1359331200,,475,4.588235294117647

It seems that my expectation were too high and i was hoping to for a proper sequel. This was a waste of my time. The plot had holes the size of the US govt debt and the story had the depth of an 80s action movie without the 80s action ""fun factor""",1359331200,,308,3.8125

The director paints the Eastern European cultures as corrupt, ugly, uncaring and so full of hate they are beyond reason or compasssion.

4970740,4,B0067EKYDG,"This is a good movie but not as well done as the first Taken film. There was still a lot of action and it had a fasted paced plot and storyline but the concept was just not as fresh. In some of the areas the scenarios were just a little hard to believe.

Byran Mills (Liam Neeson) is in the protection business using his skills that he learned in the CIA to protect wealthy people for a lot of money. His family life is a wreck as he is divorced and his daughter lives with her mom. After rescuing his daughter in the first Taken film he becomes a target of international terrorists who seek revenge for the deaths of their family members (Sons) at the hands of Bryan who killed them as he rescued his kidnapped daughter.

As Bryan's ex-wife and daughter meet up with him in Istanbul the terrorists gather to enact plans to kidnap them all and have the added joy of torturing his family in front of him...

Liam Neeson does his regular spectacular best in this movie playing the highly skilled ex-CIA agent on a mission to save his family. There are many good chase scenes, gun battles and fights to entertain any action movie junkie. I really enjoyed them. The only down side for me is that Bryan puts his daughter at risk and despite the fact that he had a communication device neither he or his daughter sought out help from the CIA or the US Embassy to rescue them.

I thought it was a well made movie, simple, yet thrilling.  When I saw the trailer for Taken 2, I was very excited to see the follow up story.  The movie is a follow up story, however it is not in the same class as the original.  There really is no spoiler alert, it's the father of the main Albanian guy (Marco) looking for revenge.  People get taken, they escape, and bad guys die.  Taken 2 was basically the complete opposite of the original.  Taken 1 had little buzz, but with low expectations it ended up being great.  Taken 2 had more buzz and high expectations, but ended up being a major disapointment.

4970836,3,B0067EKYDG,"I really wanted to love this movie.  The first Taken was super, and I've been wanting more in the same vein from Liam Neeson since then.  I was happy when Taken 2 finally came out on DVD and ordered it right away, even after reading the negative reviews.  So, it just arrived and I've watched it for the first time.

I'm disappointed and angry at the director.  I think he had a poor concept of what the end result of his decisions would look like.  The super-fast camera angle changes during fights in particular were a big mistake.  In fact, I can't think of anything he did right.

The acting is great, of course.  The whole cast is superb.  Actually, everything about this movie is first-rate, except for the directing, and if I were rating based on that alone, I would have to give it a 1 since that's the lowest Amazon rating.

I don't regret buying it, but I wish I'd waited until the price went down some.  I got it at $14.95, and the price will drop, probably pretty quickly, when the distributors realize they'll have to drop their price in order to sell all their stock.

So, buyer beware.  This movie is not nearly as good as the first one.  It's worth owning if you really enjoy watching Liam Neeson take out bad guys and be a hero.  But read the reviews that detail all the bad points about the directing and believe them.  If you still want to own it, as I did, and if like me, you haven't seen it yet, then at least you'll not be unaware when you watch it for the first time.  My recommendation, though, is to rent it first, and decide for yourself how much you like it.  I didn't rent it first because I'm that much of a Liam Neeson fan.",1358985600,15,1654,4.243589743589744
4970847,3,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2(released Sept/12) stars Liam Neeson as Bryan Mills,Maggie Grace as Kim Mills,Famke Janssen as Lenore, and others. Neeson is back in his role,from the first film,as a retired special agent with ""many skills"".The action,when it roles,is fast and furious and the production team makes good use of the booming bass lines and noise emphasis that has become so popular in films these past few years,to ""enhance"" the on screen action. I have a problem with this film,but let's get into the plot first.
The story has us all reunited with the Mills family in L.A.,and this time around there are two converging plots. One is that Neeson's ex is having problems with her new beau and his daughter is trying to get out of taking her driving test that she and daddy have been working on for some time. We switch over to a funeral in Albania where the father,a crime boss,and father of one o the kiddnappers from the first film,is laying to rest his son along with the others Neeson killed the first go round. The father wants revenge and revenge he shall get.
Back in L.A.Neeson is off to Istanbul,Turkey to provide security for a wealthy Arab sheik. He had asked his ex and daughter to come along,but not hearing anything,flew over alone. He is surprised,once his work is done,to have them walk in on him in the hotel lobby. About 30 minutes into the film the Albanians follow and finally kidnap both Neeson and his wife. His daughter is back at the hotel in the swimming area. The couple have hoods over their heads in the kidnap van,but the ever vigilant Neeson counts the miles and keeps track of sounds he hears. They arrive at kidnap central and the wife is cut on the neck and turned upside down in chains to bleed to death,while Neeson,shackled,has to watch. Neeson has a small phone hidden and manages to call his daughter to tell her what has happened and to get to her fathers hotel room a.s.a.p..The kidnappers come but don't find her.
Neeson and daughter reconnect and Neeson has his daughter plotting points on a map and throwing grenades to see how fast the sound reaches Neeson's ears. In short order his daughter has a fix on dad and finds the very chimney that falls down into his room. Neeson has meanwhile freed his wife and the gun his daughter throws down provides him with some defense. His daughter gets chased over rooftops by the kidnappers while Neeson leaves his wife to help his daughter. This he does and both commandeer a cab and return to the kidnap location. Neeson goes in but his wife has been taken away. Neeson and daughter are chased through the narrow Istanbul streets until they are able to reach the U.S.Embassy there and safety. Neeson leaves his daughter to return to find his wife.
Neeson retraces his original trip in the van and finds kidnap central where his wife is. He fights his way in,finds his wife and leaves her once more to get to the leader. Neeson gives the man a choice to stop following he and his family,or otherwise be killed. When the man nods in agreement he drops his gun and the man picks the gun up and fires an empty gun at him. Neeson had of course taken the last bullet out. Neeson dispatches the father tout suite. The film ends with the family enjoying a dinner on,what looks suspiciously like,the Malibu Sports Fishing Pier.
The film certainly has a lot of action to it and Neeson is stone cold,smart and calculating as before. However the prerequisite for an action film is believability. The first one had it in spades,that's why it was so good. This one had some disturbing lapses that had me mentally saying ""c'mon,you just didn't do that?"".One moment is when Neeson's daughter is fleeing their hotel and she goes straight to the basement,like she knows where she's going,she enters an employee locker area,opens one up and puts on the clothes inside(as to blend in) and leaves. I have never seen a better FITTING ensemble than she had on when leaving. That was NOT believable. Another issue is that of Neeson's daughter and her lack of driving license. It is assumed that she and her dad had been practicing for months in his car,but she had avoided getting her license. To top that knowing that most of the cars in California are automatics,it boggles the mind to watch her drive the stolen cab in narrow Istanbul streets like she was a pro,AND uses a stick shift,which she,at least as far as we know,knows nothing about!!?? Then there is the matter of Neeson's wife and her kidnapping. The fact that Neeson left her once to help his daughter is bad enough,but leaving her again is just so out of Neeson's character as to be totally unbelievable. It is funny that I bring this up because this DVD has an alternate ending to it,which I prefer. In it Neeson doesn't leave his wife the second time. In that version instead Neeson,after having helped his daughter and having returned to kidnap central to fetch his wife,he does indeed come back with her and all of them flee to the U.S.embassy instead of just Neeson and daughter in the theatrical version. The director has a comment before you watch the alternate ending that he preferred the theatrical cut,but thought this alternate provided better entertainment. Well I think he blew it. The alternate ending is the most believable and is most in keeping with Neeson's character. I could have maybe somewhat overlooked the daughter's cloths wearing and her pro like driving skills with a manual shift,but when the lead character does something that is so totally out of line with what he should normally be expected to do,especially a character like his that is so detailed oriented,then sorry I cannot buy into it.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include that alternate ending I told you about and an interview with Neeson on his promotional junket for the film.
All in all,though the film has its good action moments and Neeson is in top form in his character,the film falters because of the producers letting the aforementioned incidents of unbelievability sneak into the film. I cannot fathom why the director,if they really KNEW the character of Bryan Mills,would they prefer a version that clearly goes against type? For the good of the film's integrity,the theatrical version's ending should have been the alternate,not the other way around.",1358985600,,6328,4.706943192064923
4970848,5,B0067EKYDG,"I liked it a lot.  It may not have been as good as the first, but I think it's only because you already know the premise of the movie and the characters, so there's not as much of the initial surprise and excitement of what's all happening, as you did in the first movie.  That being said, it was one of my favorite sequels for sure!",1358985600,,333,4.03030303030303

4970850,2,B0067EKYDG,"One hopes for a return of a great story when they make a sequel. It doesn't happen here.

All the actors are back except for the rich husband who is now breaking up with Bryan Miles' (Liam Neeson) ex-wife, played by Famke Janssen. Miles suggests she and the daughter played by Maggie Grace join him in Istanbul after his little security gig is over. Of course, neither of them learned their lesson about staying home the first time and they surprise daddy in Istanbul so this plot can continue.

Sure enough they are followed, chased, fight and are captured i.e. Liam and Famke are caught by the family and extended family of the evil pandering, slave-trading, corrupt no-goodniks from Tripolie (pron. Tri-pool-ya), Albania who he killed in Paris in the first film. They manage to find out who he was by beating the French cop, and then by paying off someone in Tirana to find out where he was. As luck would have it, just over the border.

With a secret cell phone, Neeson manages to call his daughter who is hiding in the hotel from her would-be captors. She refuses to save herself and bravely states: ""I can do this, Dad.""

A 10th grader could have written a better story which held no surprises, hokey dialogue and implausible scenes like Liam talking to his daughter on his cell phone while he has a gun on someone and they have guns on him and his ex. They just stand there! Even the Krav Maga and Hapkido scenes were hard to follow and that 50 caliber machine gun would have split that car down the middle faster than a buzz saw.

You might ask several questions, as I did. How did someone in Tirana know that Bryan Miles would be in Istanbul? How did his captors not find the mini-cell phone? Why were their captors leaving them there tied up, to marinate? How come his ex-wife didn't scream at him at the end for asking her to join him in Turkey? How come this director wasn't traded to the Albanians for some future player to be named later?

This movie needs massive resuscitation. Only Liam's acting skill and his ability to portray a loving tender father and ex-husband while schizophrenically opening a severe can of whupas give this film a faint heartbeat.

The story line isn't believable, nor is the daughter's transformation from original ""Taken"" portrayal as an immature, reckless & often stupid teenager into a courageous, brave & often intelligent young woman.  The bad guy wasn't a convincing perpetrator seeking revenge against Liam for killing his son (among many others) for his role in the original kidnapping of Liam's daughter--let's just say he is justifiably better known for his appearance in TV ads promoting Dos Eques beer.

You may need to watch Taken again before embarking on Taken 2, since the stories are related.
Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a retired intelligence agent, is having relationship problems with his wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen) because of his troublesome career. His daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace) loves him but can't stand his scrutiny of her boyfriends.
Murad, the father of Marko, who Bryan electrocuted in the first Taken, has sworn to avenge the death. He plans to kill all three of the Mills.
The family is supposed to go out together in Istanbul. Kim says she wants to stay by the pool, in a veiled attempt to give her father and mother some alone time.
Bryan notices the couple are being followed, so instructs his wife to get out. She gets captured forcing Bryan to surrender, but not before calling Kim and warning her.
He wakes up strapped to a pole, but able to contact Kim with a phone he's concealed. He wants her to go to the U.S. Embassy but Kim convinces her father that she can help. He instructs her to go back into the hotel and retrieve his suitcase, which is filled with grenades, guns and the like.
I'll admit that Taken 2 leaves reality on the shelf after this point, but for action/adventure junkies it's still a must-see.
Never mind that Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 21% rating.
It grossed $139,548,476 in North America, and $232,044,000 Internationally, meaning a total of $371,592,476. I suspect the DVD release will just add to that bankroll.",1358899200,,1525,4.754716981132075

However, I did anticipate Neeson, with the help of cinematography, to be as outstanding as Craig in James Bond and Damon/Renner in Bourne. Pity that the car chase, the gun fight and particularly the fist fight scenes (the camera kept on swinging that one could make no sense how they really fought at all) were all sub-standard and of far lower quality than its predecessor.

I would say it is on Par with the first ""Taken"" however in the first movie Liam Neeson's determination came across in being as nasty as he needed to get his daughter back. In Taken-2 he is smart and determined but it didn't stick out as much for some reason, but its a good movie.",1358812800,,374,4.0

Taken 2 was very predictable and nothing was surprising about it. Whoever the writers were really weren't creative enough with Taken 2. It actually bordered on being boring at times. But this seems to be the problem with most sequels with the exception of Aliens!!!

This movie has a solid storyline, enough human interest/drama to hold my attention, and excellent action sequences. I found this film every bit as good as the first one. And since they left it wide open for a third movie, I hope the franchise continues to deliver.

My only complaint was with the picture quality of the film. Don't even bother trying to rent an HD movie from Amazon. It's total crap, I stream movies all the time and never have a problem with any other provider, just Amazon. Save yourself the hassle and rent a hard copy.

No buffer icons, no interruptions just a great movie experience.  Let me say this, I love Amazon Prime...  Now the Movie itself, Taken 2 was spectacular, great segue from the first installment and all the original charters were intact.  Storyline was strong and the action was non-stop.

But THIS is just So So So Stupid.  First, if your daughter had just been Taken and you were a spook type individual, would you REALLY invite her and her mother to join you in Turkey??  Would you then Leave her alone in the hotel?  I don't want to ruin it for you.  If you feel you must endure this ludicrous waste of hours that you can't get back, feel free.

4971079,5,B0067EKYDG,"This is an exceptional sequel to an outstanding movie. If you are like me, you didn't expect Taken to be so good. There was a lot of shock value there because who was thinking that Liam was going to pull out Ninja Master skills and kick as much Albanian rear as he did? But now we know, so that element of surprise is not going to be there this time. It's like when you first saw your spouse or better half naked. That is one time in life where the FIRST time is the charm. After that, it's old news. Sorry, it IS!

Luc Besson does not write, produce nor direct garbage. Anytime you see his name on a project, it is going to be good. Try to look this with FRESH EYES. Don't compare scenes from 2 to the original. Be honest, be fair, be assured you probably could do not better. Seriously, you COULDN'T! Most importantly, pay attention so you don't get on here and leave reviews that make you sound foolish. If you want to know why I say that, read the spolier below.....but do it AFTER you watch this exciting, rewarding motion picture. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to poke a bad guy in the eye....or something.....Seriously, you WILL!

Listen, I usually don't do spoilers but here I must:  SPOILER ALERT!!!!
People complaining about how the father of Marco is killed need to watch it in slow motion or use that pause button. There is some kind of a clothes rack with hooks on it behind him. When Liam uses the Hung Gar Tiger Claw to the face, he impales the bad guy on one of those hooks. I am appalled by people who have to have everything spoon fed to them. Grown men are writing that Liam must have killed him with a gentle Jedi love touch.....for crying out loud people....really????  Pay attention!!!!",1358726400,2,1716,4.369905956112853

4971081,5,B0067EKYDG,One of the reasons my wife and I enjoy Taken (both of them) is because it's about a dad who would do anything to save his family.

I liked the first movie better as it was the same genre', but I enjoy these type of action flicks (especially the Bourne series).  This Taken 2 film ends, to me, with a possible opening to continue the series.  I just hope that if it is done, that it is done professionally and well, and that the storyline does not get too ""Hollywood"".  I have seen this done too many times.

4971117,2,B0067EKYDG,"I'm feeling generous tonight so will give this movie two stars for the pretty decent action scenes, and the dramatic backdrops of Istanbul. And admittedly, the acting could have been worse. My real gripe with Taken 2 is that I was so distracted by all the ridiculous plot problems and inconsistencies that I couldn't enjoy the action. From the (straight out of central casting) Albanian mobsters speaking English amongst themselves, to the shameless product placements (Toyota, Mercedes, Apple, etc.), to daughter Kim conveniently finding Neeson's weapon stash in an adjacent (but not his) hotel room... and never mind the ridiculous ""U.S. Embassy"" scene in which Neeson and his daughter crash through a barricade manned by armed Marines, penetrate the ""embassy"" compound, and are able to just walk away free minutes later--one presumes in real life there would be some serious 'splainin' to do, if not also a lot of paperwork.  My wife tells me that Taken (the original) was a great movie. To be honest, I just don't remember. But I can say with absolute confidence that it must have been better than this dreadful sequel. This is one of those rare movies where I feel like I got ripped off paying only $4.99 to stream it (in HD) at home.  Come on, Liam!",1358640000,,1255,4.859813084112149

4971123,1,B0067EKYDG,"I enjoyed the first Taken movie so I was excited to see Taken 2. Unfortunately it's not even close to being as good as the first film. Taken 2 suffers from sequelitis! They felt they needed to make a second film because of the success of the first and it shows. It feels like the entire film was rushed from conception to production right away. The story is just a terrible copy from the first but with zero depth. The whole idea that a criminal organization would want to get justice for the families of the people you killed just seems stupid to put it mildly. Since when did people who kidnap young women and sell them to the highest bidder for prostitution have morals? Do their families think they were killed selling Bibles or something? That's how stupid the entire premise of Taken 2 is. The leader wanting revenge for Liam Neeson killing all the people from the first film is just absurd.

I personally can't even recommend renting Taken 2 because it's not even worth that much. Save your money and buy something that's actually worth watching!",1358640000,15,1053,4.571428571428571

4971181,3,B0067EKYDG,"This film is a sequel to Taken and like most sequels (except for the Goodfather) is not as good as the first movie. Surprisingly, it has nothing to do with the acting or the story but with the direction.

The plot is simple and happens in Istanbul. The father of Marco from Tropoa wants revenge. He puts together a band of thugs from his third world country and comes to Istanbul where he has access to everything: from the government officials to the police (people in third world countries help each other...). Byan Milles (Liam Neesom) is vacationing in Istanbul with his ex-wife and daughter. His ex-wife just got separated from her husband.

The movie had potential and the acting of all participants is really outstanding. However, the direction is really terrible. The fight scenes are really well done but the views from one cameras to the other are multiple and unnecessary. I don't know who did the final cut of the movie, but the person is totally incompetent. And that started with the opening titles, when the bodies are flown to Albania. There are so many camera angles/changes that make you really dizzy. At first I said, OK this it is an exception, poorly done but just the beginning, it will get better. Absolutely not! During the first fight in the market, just before he is taken, I had to close my eyes several times and look away because it made me dizzy and I wanted to puke.  I am not sure who decided to have 20-30 cameras for one fight and have an angle shown from each one at least once, but that was a bad idea; it is a total failure. I have seen Colombiana which was directed by Olivier Megaton and I know Luc Besson was involved in the making of the movie. Never had any problems with Colombiana and I have seen several movies by Luc Besson (the Big Blue, the Fifth Element) and was really happy with his plot and direction. I was really surprised by these deficiencies in this movie.

Zero stars for the direction, five stars for the acting and four stars for the script. Overall three stars.

4971218,4,B0067EKYDG,"While I would say I'm still a bigger fan of the first Taken, Taken 2 was a pretty cool follow up to the first Taken film.  Plenty of other reviews give a bit of a synopsis on the movie, as does the product's main page, so I won't bother.  What I will tell you is that it is a great action thriller, and if you are a fan of such movies then I very much recommend checking this out...of course start with the first Taken though if you haven't seen it before this obviously.

The action in these is very cool and essentially consists of Liam kicking and shooting up a lot of bad guy @$$!  2 takes a tad bit longer to start picking up than the first movie did, but the action is none the less about as equally cool.  The acting in this movie is pretty good (Liam is always good)...the dialogue at times is a little corny in my opinion between him and his family, but I guess some of that can be expected when it comes to family.

All in all though, this movie was very enjoyable, and you just love to see Liam let loose on these baddies...all throughout the movie as they were taking and holding him and his wife and attempting to take his daughter again, I was saying under my breath ""you guys are screwed now.""  LoL, and sure enough!  It looks like there'll be a 3rd one...I won't say what happens to lead into that because you should just watch it and find everything out for yourselves!

4971226,3,B0067EKYDG,"What is the point of making a sequel to a film when there is very little potential left for developing the concept of the original? A retired CIA agent Bryan Mills is back and Liam Neeson once again brings gravitas to the role that made him an action star about four years ago, but the script of ""Taken 2"" (written by Luc Besson and his long-time collaborator Robert Mark Kamen) looks more like a reenactment of the original's story set in a more exotic Istanbul location and seen from a different viewpoint.

The story is simple. Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) is on business trip in Istanbul, where he is reunited with his ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Then a band of vengeful Albanian gangsters led by Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) arrives with guns, to avenge the deaths of the men that Mills killed in ""Taken.""

Now I am not saying that ""Taken 2"" is a bad movie. The film is slick and action-packed, though action sequences tend to be less credible and thrilling because of choppy editing and our familiarity with the story. As the original's freshness and novelty is gone, the sequel (that looks more like a remake) is more predictable, treading on familiar paths and not veering into new territory, except when Neeson's character is given a rare moment to show his vulnerability.

After all, if there is one reason you should see ""Taken 2,"" it is Liam Neeson showing what a talented actor like him really can do. You know exactly where the story is going, and what his character will do, but at least he does it effectively.",1358294400,2,1554,4.643636363636364

My 13-year-old great-nephew also loved the movie--so mark two for ""Taken 2"" for its multi-generational approvals. There's a slow beginning--too slow for my nephew until the action begins, then pow! the rest of the movie. Nonstop action! After the movie, my nephew said the slow beginning was necessary to set up the story that follows. Although he is a sophisticated movie buff, almost anyone would get it that the slow beginning is necessary.

This time out, Neeson's daughter is car driving age--there's a big deal about not passing her driving test--a fact that becomes null and void by movie's end. In ""Taken"" Neeson kills the son of an Albanian mobster. Some kind of blood feud goes on in Albania much like the American Hatfield-McCoy feud. Neeson spilled Albanian blood, now the Albanian mob must spill Neeson and family blood.

The goons kidnap Neeson and his wife, the daughter escapes. One of the most unusual chase scenes in movie history takes place on the colorful rooftops of ancient buildings in Istanbul, Turkey. It is wild!
In the first ""Taken"" the daughter is kidnapped and sold as a sex slave. In this movie she becomes the hero. Movie history is changing. She also is part of a thrilling car chase, providing her with a set of certain skills in driving.

The movie is worth watching just to hear Neeson say he has a set of certain skills he will use after he escapes his own imprisonment. ""I will find you"" is his omninous, now iconic statement much like Eastwood and Schwarzennegger use.",1358294400,3,1774,4.787581699346405

Taken 1 was first class with a lot of action good story. 2 starts out with Neeson wanting to take his daughter out his x was crying he knew something was up will not tell anymore, as you have already guessed by the name taken this is what its about. The action is far above Taken 1 there are two ending myself I liked the one on the extras better.

It makes it look like a student experiment instead.

There is little excitement or suspense. After the first movie it's just a case of waiting for Liam to do his work.

The car chase is garbage. They drive slowly round a small part of the city in slow cars. But they cut rapidly from from car to car and angle to angle to make it look like they are doing more than 25 mph.

The scenery and the fight scenes make a valiant but futile effort to save the movie. I'm just glad I waited for pay-per-view instead of wasting four times as much to see it at the movies.",1358208000,3,689,4.196969696969697

This is a movie I was a little leery about watching. I loved the first one but I was really worried that this would be the exact same thing and would ruin the way I feel about the original. I was wrong. While this did have many of the same aspects of the first one there was enough differences to make this almost as exciting as the first one. Not many sequels can compare to the original but this one is close. Just as fast moving and thrilling as the first and if you liked that one you will like this one as well. Not much else to say about it other then this was better then I expected and this is well worth seeing. Overall, not quite as good as the first one but pretty close.

4971248,3,B0067EKYDG,"2008's TAKEN was a breath of fresh air: an action film that didn't take itself too seriously, but at the same time wasn't necessarily an homage or parody.  It presented Liam Neeson as an unlikely action hero: where he had previously seemed tall and gangly, now he was broad-shouldered and menacing, a force to be reckoned with.  And thanks to Neeson's charisma, his everyman Bryan Mills shined brightly enough to eclipse any non-PC ethics his role may have raised (Daddy is always right, and little girls should not go abroad without male protection).

Well, if you liked TAKEN, you'll like TAKEN 2...because it's basically the exact same thing.  Minus a star for originality; let's face it, that's a given.  Minus half a star for a rather uninteresting premise: the father of one of the victims from the first film decides to kidnap Mills's family in revenge.  He gets Mills and his ex Lenore (Famke Janssen, returning); however, he misses daughter Kim (Maggie Grace, also back), and as such he underestimates how some traits run in the family.  When Mills gets free (come on, you know he does) , he races the clock to retrieve his wife and dispense justice...or vengeance.  The film doesn't care what you call it.

Sound skeptical?  Well of course it is.  TAKEN required you to suspend your disbelief for a while, and just accept the fact that Mills had ""a certain set of skills"" that gave him Godlike powers.  TAKEN 2 asks you to throw your disbelief out the window and just go with it.  And you do, largely because Maggie Grace is given a lot more screen time; she goes from being the victim to a real player, a strong female role that the series desperately needed.  Neeson is still in fine form, of course; never doubt his screen presence.  It's the wholly implausible script, and frantic direction, that ultimately bog the film down.  However, for fans of the first, TAKEN 2 is a nice addition.  Perhaps not required viewing, but damned if it isn't a decent thrill ride.",1358121600,,1977,4.700581395348837

He is that eternal man on the edge. He is a man who does not give up and drives harder the more the odds are against him. The action is brilliant and makes up for a script that should have been bolstered up and tightened up. Non-the less, this film is high-octane entertainment though it should have run longer and bolstered the depth of the central characters. The film has a good idea, but falls short.",1357948800,,551,4.52
4971256,3,B0067EKYDG,"Basically, this is a decent action movie.  Nothing more.  The story is basic.  Nothing interesting or thrilling.  Taken was spectacular.  I think the reason this movie is not that great is that the daughter and wife get in the way.  We want to see Liam's character do what he does best.  There are not enough fights in this film.  Instead he needs his civilian daughter's help.  Boring.

In fact, the plot falls flat in a few really silly and fundamental ways.

He invites his family (ex-wife included) to a place we all know today is a Muslim trouble zone just waiting to become a launching pad for terrorists.  Why would a wise black ops operative do that?  Silly.  Unless, like most divorced men and women, he was secretly hoping his ex would get captured.  But then that would make this a comedy.

Also, he has all these interesting friends with histories akin to his own, but they NEVER get used!  Why are you showing us his friends??? (Who are played by some really talented actors, by the way).  What a waste of some neat teamwork scenes or innovative spy-in-the-field scenes.

Also, why the hell are we subjected to his daughter's boyfriend?  What plot purpose does he serve?  Don't waste my time.

Lastly, the guys he fights are not very spectacular.  Just a bunch of street bums and thugs really.  Wouldn't it have been interesting if the Chinese or Russians had stepped in to cause a little trouble for an American agent who has evaded them on their own soil and made them look foolish in spy operations of the past?  Maybe some special agents to help out the kidnappers and give Liam's character some real opponents?  As it is, his toughest fight is against a short squat guy who looks like he makes pizza in Hoboken, New Jersey.  And his vanquishing of the main evil antagonist was literally as easy as hanging a coat in a coat closet.  You'll understand when you see it.

The film would have been much better if Liam had been forced to deal with the Mexican cartels who kidnap innocents from America even as we speak.  Leave his family at home.  They appeared in the first movie and that was all we needed to see of them.  Give us some interesting plot twists that involve the the dirty underground of spies and internation criminals or something.  Not a silly vacation gone bad.  Frankly I think if he had lost his traveler's checks and had to search the hotel for them, watching that would have been more entertaining than a few of the scenes that did not make the cutting room floor.

Taken 3 please!  Revitalize this character.  Bring in his friends.  Kill off his annoying family.",1357948800,,2599,4.557483731019523

4971271,5,B0067EKYDG,"The unrated cut runs about 6 minutes longer.  It's definitely a harder cut than the theatrical version, but nothing R-rated.  I'm primarily interested in the storyline differences between the theatrical cut and the unrated cut, so SPOILERS follow below.  Do not read further if you do not want to be spoiled!

1) Makeout scene between Jamie and Kim is longer, nothing explicit, but Kim is unsure about going further physically with Jamie.

2) Bryan calls Sam to have him perform a routine background search on Jamie.

3) The interrogation of Jean Claude is a little more brutal and Murad's chief henchman, Suko (stunt coordinator Alain Figlarz), reveals that one of the deceased in the first movie was his brother.

4) Before Bryan takes his daughter on the fireworks boat cruise, they briefly hit up a dance club first where Kim does a little dancing.

5) After Bryan escapes from his imprisonment and fights Murad's men watching the soccer game, he stabs a man in the throat with his empty gun.  This is pretty brutal.

6) After Bryan shoots Boris who falls to his death with a finger on the trigger, Bryan is attacked by a second henchman who meets the same fate and lands on top of Boris's corpse.

7) Extra shots of Bryan skulking around Murad's hideout looking for Lenore.

8) Additional scenes of Bryan chasing Murad, Suko, and Lenore through the streets of Istanbul.

9) The final fight scene between Bryan and Suko is about twice as long as the theatrical version.  Suko cuts Bryan on the palm with his hidden knife.

10) Most, if not all, of the fist fights between Bryan and the henchmen are longer and more brutal.

11) Additional sound effects, e.g. throat gurgling, neck breakings, etc.., have been re-inserted.

12) Most, if not all, action scenes involving people dying by firearms feature extra rounds fired into the victims.

I enjoyed Taken 2.  Sure, some parts may have been MacGyver-ish, but it's always entertaining to see Liam Neeson beat up henchmen.  WSD, people.  Willing Suspension of Disbelief.  At least the hand-to-hand action scenes were better cut than the Bourne series.",1357862400,3,2103,4.848314606741573

4971274,1,B0067EKYDG,"First and foremost this review has absolutely NOTHING bad to say about the FILM itself AT ALL.  My 1 star rating is about the upcoming DVD release next Tuesday. I already know what to expect from the film itself, so again absolutely no complaints there. HOWEVER ... I don't know about everyone else, but I am extremely tired of the standard DVD constantly getting the shaft when it comes to almost never getting ""EXTENDED CUTS/UNRATED EDITIONS"". Not all of us can afford to transfer over their extensive DVD library over to Blu-Ray like we did when we transferred over from VHS to DVD. I can understand the Blu-Ray getting more bonus features and extras. I actually expect that, but an alternate version of the film? I know it can be done because it was done with standard DVD's CONSTANTLY before the Blu-Ray, so why not now? I'm pretty sure I'm not alone on this one!",1357776000,7,868,4.6
4971275,3,B0067EKYDG,"Liam Neeson is a complete badass.  How do you define a 'badass'?  Well, typically all you'd need to do is look at a picture of Chuck Norris and you'd instantly understand.  But, some things change and clearly Liam Neeson is taking over the Hollywood action scene.  If you need evidence, just watch any of his recent films.  What's that?  You hated The Phantom Menace, but Liam Neeson was still a badass?  Absolutely.  He lightsaber duels with the Sith, he kills man-eating wolves, he battles aliens on the ocean - and yes, he even takes time to beat the crap out of common criminals in Taken.

This time, Neeson returns in Taken 2 as Bryan Mills, a former intelligence agent that does security jobs on the side, while trying to maintain a healthy relationship as an over-protective father with his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace).  Rade erbedzija plays the film's villain, Murad Hoxha, an Albania mobster that is seeking revenge for the death of son (one of the countless thugs Neeson killed in the first film).  Famke Janssen also returns as Lenore, Bryan's ex-wife, who just happens to have recently separated with her most recent husband - naturally prompting a Neeson/Janssen reunion.

If you're looking for a movie with drama or basically any kind of plot-driven substance, this film isn't really for you.  All you really need to do is see the film's trailer and you'll quickly understand how this film is going to go.  Neeson's character and his wife are abducted and it's up to their daughter to help free them.  It's pretty cut and dry, meaning the film is completely predictable from beginning to end.  However, if you judge the film on that merit, you'll hate it and most likely not even spend your money to see it.  The point of this film (and most any film) is to be entertained - by a watered-down James Bond - who's only mission is to retrieve his family, while beat up the bad guys on his way.

Overall, if you're a fan of the first Taken, then you'll definitely want to see the sequel.  Same actors, same action, same premise, etc.  It's a quick 90 minutes, so don't even bother checking the time.  It will be over before you know it, and once you're engaged with all the excitement that this film has to offer, you'll be begging for the next sequel.  And, by all means - bring it on!

4971292,3,B0067EKYDG,"So we finally saw Taken 2 and to be honest it is not as bad as everybody said it was, however it is still not as good of course as the first one. The story was actually good but the way this movie was filmed was not good at all. The choppy shots, the non focusing in on the characters, and the blurring camera shots make this movie not up to par with the first. The first one had a great story plus the action was clear and distinctive. You were literally biting your nails watching it and wondering what was gonna happen next. With this one you have a hard time seeing the fight scenes and getting into the action sequences in the film. The story was really interesting however and its a shamed the director didn't know what to do with this material.

Taken 2 probably should have gone straight to video as one of those Walmart $9.99 blu ray specials. I guess if nobody watched part 1, then they'd be reasonably entertained by Liam's tough guy character. Best part was watching the car chase scenes where the idiot daughter (who didn't even have a license yet) was outrunning the equally idiotic goons. After the 4th dub of Liam saying ""faster faster"", I promised myself to never, ever, ever, ever, ever take a gamble on a sequel...

Clearly, he is the smartest one in the group. It can certainly be appreciated how he ( Liam N) tracks people and gets out of the tightest situation with minor harm. Overall, the action is good and I can tell you after this movie, maybe the third one if it happens will just be about Liam N., his fellow spies, and the terrorists for there is no need for wife and kid anymore.

I did not see this movie in the movie theater so I was interested to see how it would hold up to the original.

I have to say that the movie was definitely action-packed, low the beginning was a little bit cheesy with the build up to the action itself, but once the characters got to Istanbul, the actual action ramped up very quickly. It is believed definitely get to know Bryan Mill's (Liam Neeson) family much more than you did in the first. Did you get to see Liam Neeson's character doing what he does best, working alone, and taking no prisoners. Liam Neeson does a great job in his role and in some cases saves the film.

There are some great action scenes in the movie, and definitely some far-fetched things as well but all in all the movie was well made, this photography was great and the overall story itself was pretty good. The only part of the movie that was a bit far-fetched me was when Bryan Mills and his wife were kidnapped, the car scene makes it seem like they go much farther than they actually do and Mills is able to discern through his amazing CIA training where he is through the explosions of a few grenades ( which is pretty cool but a bit far-fetched).

4971344,4,B0067EKYDG,"'Taken 1' was a very good film, 'Taken 2' is so unbelievable that parts are laughable. However, the violence and fast pace kept me immersed in this film.

 Liam Neeson, plays Bryan Mills, an ex-CIA extraordinaire, his daughter, Kim played by Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen, plays ex-wife to Bryan.  First of all, Bryan is more than a helicopter parent, he has a GPS inserted into his daughter's iPhone, so that he can track her. His ex-wife is separated from husband #2, but seems to forget him quite easily, and has her eyes on her ex.  Bryan must go to Budapest to guard a sheik, and invites his family to join him after his job is complete. Of course, the father of the bad guys Bryan killed previously in 'Taken 1', has his eyes on revenge. He plans on killing Bryan, and then discovers the entire family is in one place, what a coup!

Bryan and his wife are kidnapped, while daughter, Kim stays at the hotel pool. Wife, Lenore is hung upside down with a slow bleed from her neck. Somehow, (this is the unbelievable part) while chained and shackled, Bryan is able to call daughter Kim and gives her explicit directions on how to find them. Not only did Kim fail two driving tests but she is somehow able to travel the streets of Budapest at very high speed, maneuver tight squeezes in the stolen cab and avoid getting them killed. Bryan, meanwhile, kills everyone standing, sitting and hiding. What a guy! what a family!

Recommended for the lovers of violence and unbelievable action.  prisrob 01-02-13

I didn't watch it with my USMC husband who counts each shot and knows what gun holds what magazine, etc. It's an action movie, how often are they ever realistic? It was a fun two hours.

4971361,1,B0067EKYDG,"Taken 2 is nowhere near as good as Taken. While Taken isn't the most inventive action film, it was very enjoyable and had some genuine excitement. This is not the case for Taken 2. Taken 2 takes the ""Bourne"" approach even more than the first, utilizing the very cliched shaky cam and quick cuts. Quick cuts are even used in slow dialogue scenes, and for no obvious reason. As an editor myself, I believe cuts should be precise, intentional, and purposeful. As I was studying some of the shots in this film, I came to the conclusion that the editors didn't really put much thought into WHY the cuts were being made, other than to make the film faster-paced, and it didn't work. Also, the director overused high-shutter speed cameras to ""intensify"" fight scenes. This made me dislike the film even more, as this is an extremely overused technique. This film wasn't just bad technically. The writing was poor. A friend I was with even pointed out some contradictions in the dialogue, causing some serious continuity issues. The writers were very sloppy and it is clear the focus of this film was not on the story or the writing, but the action, which is something a film should NEVER do.

I apologize for not being able to find anything good with this film. Taken 2 is a prime example of what I dislike about action films: fast cuts, shaky cam, and high shutter speeds, not to mention, poor writing and dry acting. This film was obviously action-based with weak characters and a very flimsy script. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to go to the movies and literally be in a coma and not use their brain whatsoever. This is easily a candidate for the worst film of the year.",1356912000,11,1680,4.562913907284768

4971364,3,B0067EKYDG,"Maybe I had too high an expectation for this sequel, but like most sequels, it is not as good as the first movie.  It has less of a story and less intensity for the action plot.  I thought it was not too convincing that the daughter all of a sudden became so capable when she could hardly drive a vehicle just a few days before.",1356825600,,328,4.030769230769231
4971365,3,B0067EKYDG,"Enjoyed the mathematics involved the father and daughter connection,not a mind blowing performance, still very worth watching nonetheless.  The choice of Istanbul was perfect for this film, worth seeing just to take in all the footage....",1356825600,,238,5.611111111111111

4971367,5,B0067EKYDG,I realize that everyone expects certain elements in a sequel to be a good.  This movie had everything needed to make it a great movie.  The movie was just the right length and had the correct pace to keep everyone interested from beginning to end.  It is certainly worth the purchase and recommend everyone who saw the first Taken to watch this one too.,1356825600,,353,4.484375

4971371,4,B0067EKYDG,"This movie picks up with Brian taking Kim and Lenoir to Istanbul for a vacation. Lenoir has just divorced and is trying to reform their family bonds. Meanwhile, the families of the dudes Brian killed in Taken 1 come for revenge. This time, Brian and Lenoir are taken. Kim helps them escape and Brian proceeds to murder all the bad guys in the face. That's the plot, not a whole lot of difference from the 1st film.

The difference is the directing and production quality. The director's name is Oliver Megaton. I've met a lot of people, but I've never heard the name, Megaton. I can only assume that this dude went to the courthouse and changed his last name trying to be cool. That is kinda the way this movie felt. It seemed like someone tried to do something cool in a really half baked way. The result was mediocre. If Liam Neeson wasn't the star of this film, nobody would have given it a second thought. Oliver Megaton made a mega mediocre film. Liam Neeson saved it and made it sort of cool. Overall weighing the good and bad, this film is 4 stars in my opinion. It's worth watching once, but I wouldn't want it taking up space on my shelf.",1356739200,2,1147,4.359813084112149
4971372,4,B0067EKYDG,"How do you come back from the worst experience in your life? Therapy, denial, maybe some substance abuse? What if, after a relatively short amount of time, you're flung back into a very similar circumstance? I don't imagine that would help.

Sometime after returning to the relative safety of Los Angeles, Bryan Mills (played by Liam Neeson), his ex-wife Lenore (played by Famke Janssen) and their daughter Kim (played by Maggie Grace) are still rebounding from the trauma they suffered. Bryan (Neeson) arrives at Kim's home to give her a driving lesson only to be informed that she is not even in the house. She's with her boyfriend. A boyfriend Bryan knew nothing about, no less. Simultaneously, in Tropoje, Albania, Murad Hoxha, father of deceased kidnapper and human trafficker Marko Hoxha, is attending a funeral service being conducted for his son and his accomplices. Murad (played by Rade Serbedzija) vows to avenge the deaths of his son and his friends. After hearing that a planned vacation to China is cancelled by Lenore's now estranged husband, Bryan invites both Kim and Lenore to join him on a business trip in Istanbul once he's fulfilled his professional obligations. They arrive sooner than expected and, unbeknownst to them, followed by Murad's henchman. Following a family lunch in the marketplace, Kim returns to the hotel. It's immediately apparent to Bryan and Lenore that their daughter hopes privacy and the exotic locale will rekindle feelings of love in her long-divorced parents. While romance does seem to be in bloom between the couple, it is abruptly halted when Murad and his men make their play for the Mills family.

  Now, I was and still am a huge fan of the 2008 film. I believe Neeson took a film that would've seemed dull and uninspired in the hands of Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, or any other contemporary action star and elevated it beyond the material. This film, while entertaining and plausible enough for an action/adventure, is the lesser of the two. Of course, there's the fact that it's more of the same and, therefore, less interesting. In addition, while the original depended on Neeson's estimable talent, this film relies heavily on Maggie Grace. A competent actress, sure, but nowhere near as good as Liam Neeson. I enjoyed it about as much as I expected to. That's it.",1356739200,,2321,4.943589743589744

4971393,3,B0067EKYDG,"(Spoiler Alert!)

Risking his family (including ex-wife),abroad,  in Istanbul after the daughter's prior ordeal is not very realistic for a guy with all his experience. Certainly, retribution/revenge should have been a known hazard of his job, and allowing them to join him within the borders of where he currently practiced security should not have been an option. Why the Albanians had not raped and killed his wife leaves one wondering how hot vengeful thoughts coursed through the veins of the ""leader"". Having the agent's daughter throw grenades about town, without consideration for the collateral damage to the innocent of the city does not sit well with me, in spite of his preliminary concern over the first grenade being exploded in a place devoid of human contact.. Also, his inexperienced driver daughter drove like a pro out from the debris of multiple car wrecks, which would have rendered any other. (Don't know how they managed to get to the front steps of the embassy) car inoperable. Well, it is  just an action flick fantasy, after all is said, but ""Taken"" was believable, and that's why only 3 stars here!",1356480000,,1125,4.973404255319149

4971396,2,B0067EKYDG,"Taken II suffers from the same problem 'Taken I' did. It's big on well choreographed action sequences, has good acting by Liam Neeson, nice locations, fairly good production qualities, directing, etc. But it lacks any common sense at all. Most action films where there are a lot of bullet's flying and car crashes require the viewer to suspend belief to a certain level. But these two films take excessive license with it, and often to laughable levels. I pretty much hated the first one. Though I found it very entertaining on a brainless sort of level with great action sequences, I simply could not get past the rediculous notion that a girl who's father worries something will happen to her get's kidnapped the second she shows up in Paris. She's literally targeted the very moment she lands. That sort of license pushes the envelope so far that it's insulting to the audience's common sense. That particular part of the script and the plot was pathetic and just plain stupid. Also the girl who played his daughter was very plastic and cheesy. I saw Taken II last night and did find it entertaining, and I liked it a little more than I liked the first one, but only because I already realized you have to leave all your brains at the door in order to enjoy it at all. In the first one she's just plastic and annoying. In this one she's not only plastic and annoying, but she's running around on rooftops throwing hand granades all over Istanbul, and driving getaway cars like a pro stunt driver when earlier on in the movie she's studying for her drivers license and can't even figure out how to park right. This one takes more license with the stupidity than the first one for sure. This is sort of like watching a John Woo or Michael Bay movie with slightly better production values. What I mean by that is that Woo and Bay action films usually cross the line into the rediculous and are generally rather out there. But thta is not to say Woo's earlier asian films were bad, they were really ok for what they were. But movies like Armageddon & The Rock for example are generally liked by a lot of people but are also hated by a lot of people. And if you hated those movies then you likely know where I am comming from. This is typical of the formula you expect from a Steven Seagal movie. Lots of action but short on brains. Also when I saw the first Taken I kept imagining Keifer Sutherland playing the main character. To all intents and purposes the Neeson character is a carbon copy of Jack Bauer, still I loved Neeson as this character. In fact without him the film would not be memorable for most people who like it now. The Taken movies play like cheesebal B style action movies, but still on a brainless action level both movies are pretty entertaining. So I hated and liked both movies, hence the 2 star rating.",1356393600,,2825,4.487378640776699
4971397,3,B0067EKYDG,"Viewers of the original ""Taken"" recall that the Armenian thugs operating in France, who captured and sold Liam Neeson's daughter into sex slavery, got their comeuppance when CIA-trained Dad found them in Paris.  It turns out that those dead twenty-something gang members had relatives who now seek revenge.  And how will they exact it?  Well, there's a reason these movies are entitled ""Taken"".

This time the locale is Istanbul.  One could reasonably conclude that Director Olivier Megaton had to be mightily influenced by the Bourne Trilogy as there are similarities.  There's lots of action - likely to make up for a predictable plot (I won't give it away, other than to say most viewers will have it figured out in the first 20 minutes).  It's definitely not in a league with the Bourne series, and runs a poor second to the original ""Taken.""

Like: Brian Mills isn't super human, we see him actually look like he's struggling in some of the fight scenes. Liam Neeson mentioned in an interview that he didn't want to do the film if it lacked this element since it wouldn't make sense for Brian Mills to take a beating and be perfectly fine at his age. Kudos for this.

Dislike: Cheesy. Mills and his wife get back together. Some of the mushy dialogue. Yuck.

Like: The daughter (who's name escapes me as I type this) serves a purpose.

Dislike: The daughter is still whiny and immature. Listen to your flippin' father! He saved your butt so he obviously knows what he's doing!

Like: The idea of revenge. You can't kill a bunch of people and not anger someone.

Dislike: The villain is an old man... Okay, bonus points for making Liam Neeson have to face someone in his age bracket and for mirroring the situation Mills went through in the first film (loss of child). However, it's almost pathetic... maybe it should've been an uncle? Brother? Brother-in-law? ....anything other than the father of one of the people he killed in Taken.

Like: The fact that there is this gray area of morality brought up by having Mills face the father of someone he killed. Why was his daughter's life worth killing so many people? Shouldn't he face some sort of punishment for his actions? Even if they were bad men, he still took the law into his own hands and killed them.... When there's a gray area like that it makes the film more interesting regardless of what side of the gray area your opinions lie.

Dislike: You set off how many grenades in Istanbul and no one noticed? The city didn't shut down for potential terrorist activity? Huh? Not believable at all.

*Taken 2 (2012)- 1/5

Taken 2 is a sequel to the 2008 film (Taken) which is newly directed by Oliver Megaton. It stars Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, and Rade Sherbedgia. I love the first movie, so does Taken 2 live up to my expectations? Ha, it's not even in the same league, and it's the worst movie I've seen so far this year.

Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) killed a lot of men while searching for his daughter, Kim (Maggie Grace), who was taken in Paris by a human trafficking ring. Family members of the men, whom he killed in the first film, are mourning those who died. Murad (Rade Sherbedgia) who's the employer of the men and father of Marko, a victim whom Bryan killed, swears revenge, and states that they will find Bryan to avenge the deaths of their loved ones. Murad and is men capture Bryan and his ex wife, Lenore (Famke Janssen), while Kim lucks out and helps her parents escape death.

Taken 2 falls flat in every single way possible compared to the awesomeness of the first Taken movie. Let me start off by saying the only good thing about the film... (crickets), (crickets), (crickets)... That's right, there's nothing good to say about it.

There are so many 'I just rolled my eyes' moments in the film, and there's very little that's believable; While Bryan is involved in a gun standoff with Mured's men, the kind men let him whip out his phone to warn Kim that he and Lenore are being taken (I just rolled my eyes). Kim can't pass 2 driving tests, but she can throw grenades, do geometry, jump from rooftop to rooftop, and can drive like a stunt driver in a chase scene (I just rolled my eyes). Murad, who knows Bryan can kill just about anyone, gives Lenore a baby gash, hangs her upside down, tells Bryan, who's tied to a pole, that she's got 30 minutes until she dies, leaves the room with them unattended, and expects everything to go as plan (I just rolled my eyes). When Bryan obviously breaks free and saves Lenore, he later fights some of Murad's men, but somehow he's got special powers this time around; Bryan can simply put his hands on someone's face, and that person will instantly die (I just rolled  myeyes).

The first Taken was far more energetic, there was more dialog, the villain isn't old and pathetic, and events were much more believable. Taken 2 is soulless compared to the first, and should be avoided at all costs as this is a simple cash grab. If you're a fan of the first (like me) and wanted a sequel, use your imagination instead, and continue to just watch the first Taken. If you couldn't tell by now, Taken 2 gets a recommended 'must-pass.'",1353628800,55,2635,4.502092050209205
4971433,1,B0067EKYDG,"I'm going to start off by saying how much I love action movies. The Expendables 2 was easily one of the best action flicks I'd seen in a long time and the first Taken is one of my all time favorites. HOWEVER, this movie is a terrible excuse of an action film.

The movie takes up very shortly after Taken ends, with the families of the men Neeson killed in the first film hungry for revenge. The film takes a considerable amount of time to get going but once it does, you want it to stop immediately. The action scenes (which are the core part of a proper action movie) are hideously choreographed and filmed even worse. You can't follow the action because of the 'edgy' camera shake (popularized by Paul Greengrass in the 2nd and 3rd Bourne movie and poorly imitated by every would-be action director out there) but even if you could, you'd be bored by the aforementioned choreography. The first film had frenetic action scenes that were filmed beautifully and packed with brutal and unique disarms and kills. This was just Neeson trudging along from one hapless goon to the next.

Speaking of trudging that's all this film does, from one pointless scene to the next. The only remotely interesting scene is a chase sequence in which Neeson's daughter (Maggie Grace, who was the one bright point of this awful film), who doesn't yet have her driver's license, is driving a taxi cab around this little town like she's Tanner Foust. And even this sequence isn't very interestingly filmed or exciting. If you want to see how a proper car chase is filmed, watch Ronin.

Luckily this train wreck of a movie is over after not very long; once Neeson has disposed of (hopefully) the last henchman in the small town he's terrorized. If you are thinking of seeing this film DON'T. It is a bad movie, but worse than that it is A TERRIBLE ACTION MOVIE that doesn't even remotely compete with the first. Taken 2 is a sequel that no one asked for, and no one deserves to have to see.

4971436,4,B0067EKYDG,"You won't find any film schools showing this flick, but you will find lots of regular people enjoying it when they sit down to watch.  Liam Neeson is in typical Liam form (at least post-Schindler form), the villains are ugly thugs, and the women are both (no, wait...there is a 3rd woman...she appears twice for a total of about 24 seconds) attractive.  There is plenty of action, and a super-simple story line that drives this 90+ minute film along with nary a wasted camera shot.

This movie is a lot of fun, but it is absolutely ridiculous.  I laughed as I left the theater because of how bad some of the movie is:
1) Liam Neeson's hand-to-hand fighting skills must have atrophied a lot, because every time he is in a fight with a thug (did I mention they were all ugly?) the director uses about 6 camera angles to film the fight, and uses editing so choppy that you can't tell what anyone involved in the fight is doing.

2) Maggie Grace is playing the high-school aged daughter of Liam!  She looks like she's about 30 here, and her bad hair-dye is matched only by her too-brief nude scene (back only, no butt).

3) SPOILER HERE:  The mom is like a character out of the old Monty Python sketch..she is 'not quite dead' about five times in the flick. And every time she's 'not quite dead' all Liam has to do to make her better is pat her back.  It's so funny, that the audience was cracking up the 3rd time it happened.

This is how the story goes: Bryan Mills is the retired CIA agent with a ""particular set of skills"" who stopped at nothing to save his daughter Kim from kidnappers. When the father of one of the villains Bryan killed swears revenge, and takes Bryan and his wife hostage in Istanbul, Bryan enlists Kim to help them escape. Bryan then employs his unique tactics to get his family to safety and systematically take out the kidnappers, one by one.

4971449,4,B0067EKYDG,"When will people learn not to take Liam Neeson's stuff? TAKEN 2 addresses one of the more nagging recurring plot holes in storytelling: What happens when the hero doesn't dispose of all the villains? The sequel opens in Albania with the burial ceremony of those sex-traffickers Bryan Mills (Neeson) had mowed thru in the first film. And there's the terrifying patriarch Murad Krasniqi (Rade Sherbedgia) presiding over their graves and vowing bloody revenge.

Cut to Los Angeles, some time later. Ex-CIA operative Bryan Mills still can't help being over-protective of his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace), which sucks for her new boyfriend. For her part, Kim is still traumatized over her harrowing abduction from around a year ago. While we were away, Mills and his estranged ex-wife Lenore (Famke Jannsen) had achieved a sort of dtente. And when a distraught Lenore admits that her current marriage is speedily crumbling, to try to make her feel better, Mills invites her and Kim to holiday with him in Istanbul where he'll be conducting some security consultant work. Note that Istanbul is practically a stone's throw away from Albania. This is what's known as a foreshadowing observation.

At age one hundred and four Liam Neeson still demonstrates fantastic action chops. He generates such gravitas, his performance has such credibility, you just buy that he's perfectly capable of extricating himself from any form of tight scrape. In Istanbul, Krasniqi marshals his forces and strikes, and yet Mills is canny enough to put gum in the works. He and his wife are taken but, thanks to his timely warning, Kim escapes, if barely. We now arrive at the best segment of the film, when a captured Mills, over a phone he'd secreted away, manages to talk Kim thru the intricate process of determining his unknown location. I won't say much more than that, other than the process involves a shoelace, a map, and grenades. What follows is a nifty sequence that equally illustrates Kim's gumption and vulnerability. It allows Maggie Grace to step out of her thankless role of victim. You may have to be generous in overlooking the ridiculous stuff she gets up to in following her dad's orders.

Again, the lesson to take away here is ""Do not take Liam Neeson's stuff!"" After the box office success of this sequel there's already talk of a third picture, and I'm down with that. But only if Neeson is a participant. Yes, the sheen brought about by an aged Neeson kicking butt has worn off some, but there's still enough of that luster to make TAKEN 2 a satisfying watch. He abuses more Albanians in this film franchise than Peter Falk ever did in TUNE IN TOMORROW. It's a slick thriller, maybe not a deep one, and it fails to retain the shock value of the first film. It certainly doesn't have anything as memorable as Neeson's awesome ""I will find you"" speech. But I like the in-jokes referencing the first film. And the acting is across-the-board solid, with Rade Sherbedgia making a perfectly hissable big bad. You know he means deadly business when he bluntly informs Famke: ""Mrs. Mills, you are a good mother and a brave woman. For that I am going to send you back home... piece by piece."" Oh, yeah, he's a perfect candidate for Liam Neeson's brand of brutal efficiency. After all, he took Liam's stuff. Dude. Must. Pay.

4971451,5,B0067EKYDG,"This film is done for the European public first of all but it should work in the USA with the nostalgia of so many action films and of course Midnight Express. But the main difference with this film is that here we do not know why the Albanians and this American security agent are fighting. Albania was on the border of the war in Kosovo. So we know there is a political problem and stake. Albania was the communist country that had absolutely banned all religious activities and all religious expression. So, what's left to keep the Albanians away from kidnapping young girls and women to feed them in their lucrative prostitution network? Nothing, not even religious beliefs to try to repent, at least five minutes a day. And we just learned Albania is getting ready to join the European Community. Really? Yes, so they say in the media.

 Even more surprising is the fact that the action mainly takes place in Turkey, in Istanbul. Turkey wants to join the European Community and the Euro Zone and that's tricky to provide the European public with that totally violent, terroristic and immoral image of Istanbul. Is it trying to ask this question from all Europeans: Are you going to let that country enter the European Community as if they were peaceful and law-abiding? Or is it asking that other question from the Turks: How can you dare to want to enter the European Community when you are not even able to prevent your territory from being used like that by terrorists without any other motivation than their personal vengeance?

The film is ambiguous and very obscure as for its political and ideological motivations. It cannot move the Americans who know nothing about these political questions, but it may frankly be disturbing to the European or Turkish public.

But it is a film by Luc Besson. So there are other elements than just this unclear ideological context.

First it is an action film and Luc Besson here uses an extremely rapid tempo with no slowing down except to increase the suspense and to make us fear the worst. The action is also extremely simple in the means it uses. No super technology. The good old simple cars and car chases, then a simple pager, then some simple guns: grenades, hand guns and some assault automatic guns. That's all. All the rest is simple running and tricky inventiveness. Of course the escape through the window and along a narrow cornice on the faade of a hotel has already been used but its simplicity works perfectly well.

Second Luc Besson has to add a child, here a teenage daughter that should be just over sixteen, since she is trying to get her driver's license and she has already failed twice. Her being in any kind of danger is poignant of course, and her mother being captured and used as bait is just as bad. And Luc Besson cannot evade the clich, but so well done and used, of the father fixation and of that father who saves his daughter first and his wife, at least twice. We remember Lon of course and the little girl he decides to help in her necessary vengeance since all her family has just been executed by some dumb terrorists. That's a syndrome if not a tic or even an idiosyncrasy of Luc Besson's: the father figure that saves the day of a daughter, a mother, a family, a victim of some terroristic gang violence. That gives a touch of empathy.

The end then would not surprise at all and is so typical of Besson again. The daughter is over sixteen and so she is of age. So she has a boyfriend and the father is kind of jealous somewhere, but Besson must be aging since he is able to make the father step back from his protective jealousy concerning his daughter. Charming.

4971453,3,B0067EKYDG,"Based on the screen appeal of Liam Neeson and the sex slave trade in Eastern Europe, we give you ""Taken 2."" In Eastern Europe the action takes place shorty after Bryan Mills (Liam) went ""walking tall"" all over them to save his daughter in the first feature. They are burying their dead and vow revenge. Yes, slave traders love their children too. In the US, the action takes place at some time in the future from the first film. Liam's ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) is now separated from her husband and daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) with whom Bryan has built a solid relationship by rescuing her from slave traders, is slightly ungrateful as she would now rather spend time with her boyfriend Jamie (Luke Grimes) then let dad give her much needed driving lessons.

In order to make it easy on the script writers, Bryan and family travel to Istanbul. In spite of Liam's alertness, savvy, and being a lean mean fighting machine, his ex-wife is not and they are ""taken"" because ""Kidnapped"" has been used as too many film titles.

4971455,2,B0067EKYDG,"In which obsessively compulsive CIA veteran Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson) and his estranged family are abducted by a village of Albanian Muslims hell-bent on avenging the other half of the village, whom Mills single-handedly slaughtered in Taken 1. I hadn't had the pleasure of that particular piece of cinema as I took my seat in the Odeon Leicester Square: it turned out not to matter.

We open with a glamorous helicopter shot of an unglamorous Albanian truck, bouncing up a dirt road to a communal hilltop burial ground where, clutching a fistful of dust over his family's manifold fallen, patriarchal villain Murad (Rade Serbedzija) gravely swears vengeance on Mills' head, beseeching most of what remains of his extended family (still handsomely stocked with uncles, second cousins and nephews) to join him.

That Mills only came to be involved after the village kidnapped his daughter Kim (Maggie Grace) and sold her (among others) into slavery does not upset the Albanians' moral calculus. Burial ceremonies complete, they mount a convoy of dusty Mercs and make haste to Istanbul where, as luck would have it, Bryan is attempting a low-key reconciliation with his wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) and daughter (yes: the same one who was kidnapped last time she left L.A: clearly not the lesson-learning type).

Mills' patiently-recounted OCD, which sees him insist on (ahem) polishing his own bonnet at the car wash, seems not to extend to keeping his dependents reasonably out of harm's way: After a scene-setting educational ride across the Bosphorus (""it's where East meets West"" etc etc) and the obligatory aerial shot of Istanbul's grand mosque as the muezzin calls the faithful to prayer, the Albanian Mercs roll in. Cue mayhem.

This is big, dumb fun on a Luc Besson scale. As long as you can balance between being neither taking it at all seriously nor finding it entirely absurd (a challenge with which most of the audience, including your correspondent, struggled) it will keep you entertained.

Joyously-named director Olivier Megaton - vraiment de l'ecole Besson - certainly gives it the by name/by nature treatment: many bottomless semi-automatic magazines, carelessly-tossed hand grenades, twisted necks, caved-in skulls, improvised shivs, exploding cars and kick boxing demonstrations are required to progress a surprisingly tedious plot to a very pre-ordained conclusion. Megaton doesn't even bother with a they-think-its-all-over-but-he's-not-yet-dead final scene bad-guy reprise. Instead, proceedings draw to a indecently hasty conclusion, the film ending with a bookend glamorous helicopter shot of - wait for it - the family eating waffles in a pier-end restaurant in Venice Beach. This about says it all.

Why Liam Neeson, a sound actor and surely the sine qua non of the picture, felt at all compelled to make it is a mystery. There is little craft in it, and and the dialogue only works as irony.

Strictly routine.

4971456,4,B0067EKYDG,"The original Taken was an incredible movie, and Taken 2 has got some incredible moments. The main difference is that Bryan Mill's (Liam Neeson) family plays a much larger role in the sequel. While the first movie is about a lone wolf taking out bad guys like gnats on a summer day to get his daughter back, this one involves the family unit, so the experience, while using incredible action scenes, is a bit different.

There is also a little more down time in this film, as cheesy tender moments are used to work the audience up before mother and father are abducted by a psychotic terrorist hellbent on getting revenge as a result of Bryan killing his son.

This film provides tons of kills, explosions and everything else that makes a movie good, and it has some real cheese in it, leading up to the action you're wanting. I say go see this film. I didn't enjoy it as much as the first one because I'd rather see Bryan go it alone, but this is still a great action film. I liked it enough to want there to be a third installment.

As for the cheese in the film, the script is pretty bad, especially the dialogue between father and daughter, father and ex-wife before the movie gets rolling, but Liam Neeson is a great actor, so he saves it from veering off to Dolph Lundgren or Steven Segal territory (Hey, I'm not saying their movies are bad, just saying the dialogue is).

Anyway, if you love action and like family films, this is the one for you, brother.",1349827200,85,1461,4.4
