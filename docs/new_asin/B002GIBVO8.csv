3924808,3,B002GIBVO8,"Book of Blood (John Harrison, 2008)

Over the years, we have been treated to a plethora of Clive Barker film adaptations from the sublime (anything Barker himself directed) to the ridiculous (Rawhead Rex). We didn't get many after Barker quit his directorial career, but they've been ramping up again recently. In fact, we've had two in the past twelve months--The Midnight Meat Train and this, a mash-up of the short stories ""Book of Blood"" and ""On Jerusalem Street"". While I didn't like this quite as much as I liked Midnight Meat Train, it was certainly worth watching.

Simon McNeal (TV stalwart Jonas Armstrong in his first film role) is a book of blood--a human upon whom the dead write their stories. (We know this thanks to the opening scene, which, like the story from which the film takes its title, is simply a frame for the meat between.) He has run away, it seems, and a bounty hunter named Wyburd (Clive Russell, probably best remembered on this side of the pond for Oscar and Lucinda) is after him. Once the two of them meet, Wyburd asks for Simon's story, and Simon tells him: he was an assistant to his gorgeous professor, Mary Florescu (Crime and Punishment's Sophie Ward), during her paranormal research into a nasty old house that seems to be one of the places where the fabric between this world and that of the dead has worn quite thin...

John Harrison (no relation to M. John Harrison) has been a TV director for years, mostly working with this sort of material, but this is only his second feature film (the first was 1990's Tales form the Darkside: The Movie). I'm a bit confused by this, actually, because Book of Blood is exactly the opposite of what I normally see from TV directors who try and make the leap to big-screen work. The pacing here is, if anything, a bit on the slow side (but I didn't see that as a bad thing), and Harrison rarely uses the freedom of not having to deal with the FCC in order to fill his movie with gratuitous sex and violence. (Though he does give into the temptation a time or two. Sophie Ward fans will be pleased.) In short, it doesn't feel like a movie-length TV show, and that makes me happy. The other side of the equation is that some of the supporting characters are flat, and when it comes right down to it neither Armstrong nor Ward really leap off the screen, either. Odd, since both of them are normally quite good at this acting thing. And then there's the ending, which takes so much of the atmosphere that Harrison has painstakingly built and throws it all away with some really cheap effects that were entirely unnecessary (as opposed to the really expensive effects in bits of the rest of the film that weren't). Still, if you can ignore the last fifteen minutes, Harrison did a pretty durned good job here, and it's worth checking out. (I understand it's coming to the Sci-Fi, excuse me Syfy, Channel soon. Do yourself a favor and rent the DVD, as this is going to be sliced to ribbons to get shown on television.) ***",1252540800,4,2996,4.534195933456562
3924809,4,B002GIBVO8,"""The dead have highways, highways that spill over into our world...""  This is the premise behind Book of Blood, Clive Barkers latest horror film based upon his short stories (Book of Blood and On Jerusalem Street).
 The movie is not as fast paced as Clive's last movie, The Midnight Meat Train (sadly with a poor opening - still sore Lionsgate, still sore!) a few months ago onto DVD.  This one revolves around a house which is believed to be haunted since at least two deaths have occurred there.  The house is the focal point for a Professor looking to make her mark in the world of the paranormal and acquires the help of a gifted young man named Simon whom she believes has a special gift that can allow the house to be ""opened up"" from its deathly slumber.  The film continues where Simon has now become the focal point of the film, trying to open the house's energy up for proof of the supernatural.  SPOILER WARNING! - towards the middle of the movie, we learn that Simon has been playing Mary for a fool and faked the first ghostly experience, but not the second as he later tells.

  He then comes back and demands to show Mary the truth - but the truth is ... that we learn that it has been Mary all along who has opened up the house - and we see what that opening looks like as the ghosts of lost souls wander out, inscribing their stories on Simons pale skin.  The story within the story (based upon Barkers On Jerusalem St.) features Simon who has now become a virtual book of blood and is being stalked by a Wyburd, a sociopath for hire who hears Simons story from his own mouth as he lays on Wyburds' ""carving table.""

 The film stars such notable actors as Jonas Armstrong (Robin Hood television series) playing Simon and Sophie Ward plays the driven professor who charges beyond all limits to unlock the secrets of the house.  Doug Bradley (Hellraiser) also makes an appearance as Tollington, the first victim of the house.

  As mentioned, this movie is not as fast paced as The Midnight Meat Train it does drag on in some parts, but does feature some very notable and quite effective scenes of gore and torture (including one notable scene where a girl is raped and skinned by a violent spirit quite soon within the movie).  It opens with the subsequent telling of introducing the premise by means of telling the story of On Jerusalem Street and continues through into Barkers Book of Blood and then ends quite nicely (and bloody) with On Jerusalem Street again.  There are several scenes of torture, blood, gore and scenes not of this world which will excite any fan of Barker and of intelligent horror.

  Now, the movie does have some draw backs.  It does draw on in some areas and does in points, have a less adequate ability of keeping the audiences interest until the very end.  In short, it is a ghost story with a handful of gore, torture and blood (lots of) mixed in.  This is NOT The Midnight Meat Train, this is NOT Hellraiser, but this is Clive Barkers' Book of Blood and with that alone you are guaranteed a journey through the dark fantastic that you will not forget any time soon.

  In the end, you are left with a feeling that you have just watched a movie that is unique, but not as quick paced and full of surprises as some of the other typical Hollywood horror films (i.e. Saw, Hostel, etc.).  It is, I believe, an upgrade from today's traditional horror film - The relationship between Simon and Mary also allows the film to work on another level as well.  Overall, Book of Blood offers a ghost story with a twist and in turns delivers a movie that offers just that - but could use more of a developed story within parts.  If you are looking for a movie filled with torture and gore (Hostel?) - This is not your movie.  If you are looking for a movie that offers a bit more than blood and gore, but offers a concrete story behind it with some thought and some soul (pun intended), than perhaps you may find yourself at one of those intersections and decide to invest in watching this film inscribe itself upon you.",1247616000,11,4054,4.437837837837838

I generally hate all the lame fake blood, boobs, and other raunchy stuff packed into these types of things.  But a friend told me this flick actually isn't 1/2 bad, and a naked Jonas thru a lot of it doesn't hurt.  So today I found I had some spare time and was completely board and remembered that recommendation.  I am actually quite surprised I liked it.  The blood was not over the top.  There was equal peen=boob ratio.  The plot was actually decently thought out and not completely lame.  It had a solid beginning, middle and ending.  Heck, I even jumped at a few places.  So all in all, I give this flick a solid 3.5 stars, but since Amazon doesn't have that as an option, I gave it a 1/2 star bump just for nekkid Jonas.

There is always the question ""what is wrong with these people, why don't they just leave the house""; but the movie did answer that with Simon wanting his child experiences back, and Mary's total and complete selfishness in every aspect of her life. I loved Mary looks in the end, her hair, her dress, absolutely perfect. Starting the movie already knowing the probable outcome was also terrific. I guess we could say, poor Simon, but he did choose the beginning of his path; unfortunately, Mary chose the rest of it. I also found the similarity between Wyburd's fate and Mary's childhood fountain indident a nice twist. A good, fun, scary, creepy movie. Kudos",1367798400,,848,4.848275862068966

So I came to this movie with no knowledge of the evidently faithful reproduction of bringing the bookend short stories to screen.  And I wasn't impressed.

After an encounter between the remorseless killer named Wyburd (Clive Russell) and desperate Simon McNeal (Jonas Armstrong) ends with one of them about to be skinned, McNeal begins rambling on about how he became such a scarred mess. Wyburd, and the audience, is fortunately patient enough to listen to him ramble on about ghosts, and crossroads, and other dimensions, before he kills him.

If this seems like a perfect set up for a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tales-from-the-Darkside/dp/B001LM64VA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tales from the Darkside</a>-style of horror stories, it is.  But there isn't anything else more to it than that - Book of Blood is just the bookends of a series of tales, with the unfortunate circumstances of supposedly psychic McNeal at its center. But the real protagonist is ghost story author and paranormal investigator Mary Florescu (Sophie Ward).  Florescu takes a keen interest in McNeal and believes she can use him as a fishing lure for ghosts in a haunted house.

The problem with Book of Blood isn't this tale, which is a straightforward ghost story, but in the telling.  The first scene opens with what happened in the haunted house, and it culminates in a graphic scene so disturbing that the Book of Blood simply can't top it. It uses up its shock and awe five minutes into the story.

The actors sleepwalk through their roles, with a lens so thoroughly washed out that they appear as white smudges on a gray screen.  This is a dreary film with a slow pace that builds, but there's no mystery as to where we're building.  The possibility that McNeal is actually staging a hoax is impossible to believe when we've seen what happened to that girl in the opening moments. There's never any doubt in the audience's minds that the place is haunted.

Once the ghostly realm is revealed, there are no revelations. The big message, that ghosts want their stories told, is the same message we've heard a thousand times in other horror stories. With Armstrong literally bearing the entire film on his shoulders, the film runs out of steam pretty quickly.

Despite the flaws, there are some decidedly creepy moments. The most underused character is Reg Fuller (Paul Blair), Florescu's assistant and skeptic.  He clings to his ghost hunting technology, and director Harrison takes a measure of wicked glee in showing how futile logic is in the face of death.

But mostly Book of Blood is a frontispiece for other tales.  Alone, it's a bit of a bloody mess.",1287100800,,2881,5.326710816777042
3924823,3,B002GIBVO8,"As the plot unfolds it becomes more and more Clive Barker-esque. If you liked hellraiser, nightbreed, candyman, and lord of illusions then you should really enjoy Book Of Blood.

It never touched on a single actual ""Book of Blood"" which are short stories, since the movie didn't even allude to that.
Also, the sex scenes were too racy and normal to even remotely be attached to Clive Barker's name. If you follow his work, you know that it is a rare occurrence that simple heterosexual sex ending in orgasm and a night in bed together happens. Clive usually throws in a cenobite or at least minimal mutilation.
I believe that these people that made this movie, slapped ""Clive Barker"" on the title and figured it would make money. They didn't get my 18 dollars.

Aside from the bad adoptation, what I found very annoying was the darkness of the movie- and I'm not talking about tone- I'm talking about the fact that I couldn't SEE about 1/3 of the film.

The stories, are the books of blood that follow. In the film he's a fraud who used to be able to commune with the dead, but then he get's it back and is hunted for his flesh and the stories it holds. The first paragraph of Barker's story is repeated over and over in unatural dialogue but other than that it's a fairly solid ghost story. This is an old school gore shocker, the type that try to build character and story to get the audience involved so the scares are scary. It doesn't work 100%, it's a bit thin on character and story, so the slow my turn people off.

3924835,3,B002GIBVO8,"I'm a fairly big fan of Clive Barker's work. I've loved the books and stories (Books of Blood Vol. 1-3, Mister B. Gone, The Hellbound Heart) of his that I've read and several of his films (Hellraiser, Midnight Meat Train) are some of the best the horror genre has to offer. Midnight Meat Train was probably the best horror film to come out of last year, so my expectations were high when I heard about this film and saw the trailer. This was one of my most anticipated horror films of the year even though it seemed to get the short end of the stick with its release much like what happened with Midnight Meat Train. I can tell you that Book of Blood is a good watch, but it may not be what you're expecting.

Book of Blood has its bloody moments, but it's not an all out gorefest. It's actually more of a supernatural thriller. The director, John Harrison, described the film as being more along the lines of films like The Others and The Orphanage. It relies more on mood and atmosphere rather than blood and guts splattering all over your face, which isn't a bad thing at all if done correctly. Book of Blood almost pulls that aspect of the film flawlessly. I say, ""almost,"" because certain lines of dialogue (""I promise we will listen and I will tell your stories to the world."") and a few of the things that happened in the final act of the film (steel briefcase...it'll make sense when you see it) seem a bit cheesy, but may sit better with me on repeat viewings.

The film actually reminded me of Hellraiser quite a bit throughout the film. Other than Doug Bradley's brief cameo (if you blink, you'll probably miss him), the opening scene of when Reg and Mary go into the room where everything happened just reminds me of Frank staying in the attic in Hellraiser. Hellraiser is one of my favorite horror films, so the brief nod to the film (whether intentional or not) was very welcome to me.

My main concern with Book of Blood was how they were going to turn a short story that was originally just an introduction to the actual Books of Blood by Clive Barker into a full length film. The concern wound up being for nothing as Book of Blood met nearly all of my expectations and was extremely faithful to the original material while bringing in elements from another one of his stories called, ""On Jerusalem Street."" The story fleshes out nicely and the acting is good, for the most part. I think the perfectionist in me kept me from rating this any higher, but I'd definitely recommend it as it's a worthy addition to any avid horror movie enthusiast's collection.",1253750400,3,2573,4.470212765957447

I had high hopes with this movie, though I knew, from the stories themselves, that the development of the film would be tricky.  The actors play their parts, and they do a good job at what they were shown to do by the script.  The special effects were all right, they were, as they should be, more creepy than out and out blood-bath violent.  The scenes themselves were wonderful.  The house was well designed, the cryptic nature of the house, the shadows and the light, worked well together.  The wariness and the weariness of the actors due to the supernatural presence at the back of their minds was also interesting to see in the evolution of the story line.

Here are the problems:
1) the constant repeating of how the dead have highways...I think this quote was said at least five times during the film.  Alright.  I get it.  I understand that we are talking about more than just a simple haunting, we are talking about a nexus along the paths the dead travel upon.  You do not have to repeat this quote again and again.  Once or twice is good enough...

2) the second problem is that the story lulls, there is a time when you are feeling bored out of your mind.  Yes the characters need to be developed, no question about that, but to allow such a spacing between events, that is what brought my tension down to boredom.  Again, I don't want a blood bath a minute, but I want to see tightness in the plot.

3) this point is no fault of anyone in particular, but in the original story, there was a hint that something far, far more dreadful happened at the house then what was shown in the first part of the movie.  That would be nice to explore, see the characters, for their own means, their own intentions, exploring the past in order to focus on their desires in the present.

4) due to the pacing, as mentioned above, when a good ten minutes could have been chopped away (no pun intended) in order to tighten the plot, by the time the culmination of the events at the house start to happen, really, really happen, I'm left with more of a ""finally"" feeling inside instead of the frightful euphoria we're supposed to have when events come to culmination.

I really, really wanted to like this film.  Maybe I went into this film with too much expectation.  I love Clive Barker's work, from his short stories to his novels.  I have enjoyed many of the Clive Barker movies in the past, and I had high expectations for this one.  I feel like I was let down.  I feel like the powers that be wanted to just get this story over with so the premise of the stories from the book of blood could really begin (as we'll see with ""Dread"").  This isn't a film I'm going to throw away or sell.  I'm keeping it simply because I adore Mr. Barker's works.  Still, unlike, say, Candyman and Lord of Illusions, this isn't a film I'm going to be watching more than once in a blue moon.  If you are like me and you love Mr. Barker's work, get it, watch it, keep it.  Just don't think that it is going to be as powerful as many of Mr. Barker's other works on film.",1253664000,10,3172,4.328813559322034
3924839,4,B002GIBVO8,"I think this will be one of those underrated Barker films. Sometimes his stuff doesn't make sense, sometimes it's basically taken from him and reimagined by Hollywood in a bad way, and all too often his name on the movie can be ignored.

However, I think this is right up there with Midnight Meat Train. I read the entire Books of Blood series years ago and loved them. And this film works in a similar, if  flawed, way that those books did. I won't go into the story really, but it's based on early stories Barker wrote. There are some changes, and these are noted in the Blu-Ray addition. It's far more erotic than most other Barker films, and I disagree that the pacing was problematic in a sense. The 1st half of this film is almost a 5 star, but the ending did have some pacing problems and simply too much going on. Really, though, it looks like they actually tried to make a good horror movie, a different horror movie without young teens getting naked or slasher killers stalking people, freakish rejects in the hills etc. There is lots of gore, some minor and some big scares, and an ominous atmosphere. They spent money too making this film look good, no cheap effects, and had some darn good actors actually get into their parts.

It's a different kind of nightmare more fitting of a Barker tale than anything else.

As for the Blu Ray, sound and audio seemed to mesh very well (important when you want to get scared). The special features are very lacking, but I rarely watch all of those, just know people do like them. All you get is one behind the scenes featurette.

So I loved it. If only all the odd ideas could have been honed more. If you like Barker's horror, you'll enjoy this. Though this film is far from perfect, I liked it even more than Midnight Meat Train. And from the special features, it appears they intend to make many more films based on Barker's horror stories. Bring em on.",1253664000,4,1909,4.442857142857143
