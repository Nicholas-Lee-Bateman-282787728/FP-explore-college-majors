6109121,2,B00GSTHDG6,"While this 82 minute DVD entertained my children, I was disappointed at how many of the characters were portrayed.  God was shown as being lazy and using props for ""special effects"".  Noah was humble and righteous (though not very intelligent), but his daughter in laws bickered all of the time and his sons were useless as they didn't lift a finger to help him in building the ark.  Instead they just fought among themselves.  Unlike the Bible's version of the great flood, this show adds a couple of greedy stow-aways onto the ark.

In the animal kingdom, their lion king is an indecisive womanizer who is spoiled and incompetent.  Some of the female animals are sexualized and there are hints of mating and a few instances of potty humor.  This is a far cry from the Veggie Tale accuracy and humor we are used to.",1397433600,,816,4.586206896551724
6109122,1,B00GSTHDG6,"This is a terrible movie that I would have never purchase had I seen better previews. The title makes you think the story has a Christian outline however, is more of a joke upon the true story of Noah and the flood.",1396828800,,215,4.142857142857143
6109123,3,B00GSTHDG6,"This version of El Arca is ok for kids that are aloud to watch some PG movies. One problem I have with this version is they cut out a lot of scenes from the original, & it shows. I would like it if Shout Factory! did a uncut/uncensored version on Blu-ra with behind the scenes documentaries & commentary (both in English) to make it a great product.",1395878400,,349,4.223880597014926
6109124,2,B00GSTHDG6,"I knew from the cover of this Noah's Ark DVD from Shout Factory that it would definitely be a different interpretation of Noah's Ark but...wow. It's hard to even put into words.

While this is based on the Bible story of Noah's Ark, it's definitely a very loose interpretation with lots of liberties taken in the story. Noah's family is rude and annoying, especially his sons wives. I'm assuming it was an attempt at adding humor to the story but it comes across as crass and sarcastic.

God in this movie is also silly and comes across as unintelligent as does Noah. Again, an attempt at humor and while those that don't know the story of Noah's Ark might be amused, those that know the Bible story probably won't.

I watched this with my kids and at four and six they even noticed the discrepancies between the story they know and the movie. I just explained that it's for entertainment and not an exact retelling of the story. Aside from the inaccuracy, I didn't really enjoy the movie. There was just too much sarcasm, rudeness and behaviors I don't really want my kids imitating.

If accuracy matters to you, most Christians probably won't enjoy the Noah's Ark DVD. If you like satire and are just looking for entertainment, you might enjoy it...",1395792000,,1251,4.621621621621622
6109125,1,B00GSTHDG6,"I bought this movie for my 5 year old son. It is the most awful movie. My recommendation...STAY AWAY...DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! The DVD case states that this movie is based upon the Bible account of Noah. No way. There were animals kissing; provocative female characters; references to sex; God was lethargic and bugged by having to tend to Noah; there were human stow-aways on the arc; Noah's family fought constantly...I could go on about how BAD this movie is. Fortunately, five minutes into the movie, my son lost interest and went to his room to play with toys. My husband and I watched the remainder of the train wreck. It's just awful...cannot express how bad this is.",1394755200,3,675,4.680672268907563
6109126,5,B00GSTHDG6,"This movie was released in it's native Argentina in 2007 and it was subsequently released into parts of Europe but never received a US release, despite the existence of an English dub that could be seen on the Internet.

This movie may not have the same charm compared to a Disney movie (which, ironically, was distributed by Disney in some places) , but it has its quirks such as innuendos in the case of the female characters and some annoying characters like Noah's sons' wives but this a movie that I could recommended to almost anyone.",1392681600,,540,4.625

8627071,1,B00GSTHDG6,"This movie is absolutely terrible, and I can't imagine who the intended audience was supposed to be. It's not cute, funny, amusing, clever, or in any way close to being historically accurate (even allowing for the fact that it's a full-length animated version of the true story). There is no mention of the sinfulness of man (God's motivation for flooding the earth), the righteousness of Noah and his family, the holiness of God, or the love and grace that he demonstrated by preserving Noah's family (and, in effect, the human race).

According to this film, God sleeps most of the time and is assisted by a dainty little cherub, he used special effects (including a fake voice and a twirling spotlight from heaven) to command Noah to build the ark, the rainbow after the flood (which is barely shown in the film) is likewise a special effect, and all of the animals are self-centered, rude, competitive, and disrespectful of everybody but their own selves.

If this had not been a Christmas gift to our children from a close family member, I wouldn't have let them finish watching it through once. Now that they've seen it, though (and were just as unimpressed by it as my wife and I were), this movie will be thrown in the trash. It's not worth keeping, nor is it good enough for us to give it to the local rescue mission, since we can't imagine anybody else liking this terrible movie much better than we did.",1483142400,,1414,4.629482071713148
8627072,3,B00GSTHDG6,"A word of advise for any fellow furries thinking about buying this for Panty's stage number, don't buy this version.

The American version has cut out a few scenes to make it more children friendly... Especially the scene where Panty goes up on stage singing her version of ""I Will Survive""!

I was hoping to get that scene with this DVD, but I didn't realize this was edited until I started watching it So to parents, this version is more children friendly than the original. But still, I wanted to have this uncut.

If anyone knows where I can get the uncut version of this, let me know.",1473811200,,589,4.435185185185185

8627074,3,B00GSTHDG6,"Nicely packaged with a panorama of the characters inside and art on the disc proper. BUT....

For those who are interested in this because of the web popularity some years back, I must warn you that this has been edited to remove some of the scenes that made it popular back then. Pant(h)y's introduction and song are missing. She just appears at a table with the plotters sucking on a drink. (Although the song does get played over part of the end credits.) The running joke about the deer and the donkey is gone. The bit about Xiro giving concessions is gone, etc. (Not going to list every cut, sorry.)

To get a complete copy I had to get a Russian release that had the English track as an option. (You will need a multi-standard/region player if you go the foreign edition route.)",1454284800,,784,4.475524475524476
