8365756,4,B002DQBYMM,"As is the case with all the Memphis Wrestling dvd's I have (4) The quality is an issue both in sound and picture. You get a full 1 hour battle between Harley Race & Jerry Lawler which is a great brawl in my opinion. The full Lawler/Hennig match where The King captures his 1st World heavyweight title. However the match with Bockwinkel is NOT the $500 dollars per punch match as that is only shown in a breif clip, this is the match that preceded that 1 still a solid bout though. Unless WWE releases the footage this is your best oppertunity to get it.",1363996800,2,553,4.276190476190476
8365757,5,B002DQBYMM,"Please, do yourself a big favor and ignore the nonsensical review below. This is a wonderfully detailed look back at one of the most famous feuds in pro wrestling history: Memphis superstar Jerry Lawler vs. actor/comedian Andy Kaufman. It's a thorough mini-doc, featuring loads of clips from the weekly TV show program and arena shows. The clips look fantastic. This is a must.",1342483200,3,377,5.0

Far be it for me to bash someone because of a difference of opinion-but Highspots' Memphis series feature some of the finest booking, bouts, announcing, interviews, angles, etc in the history of pro wrestling. This particular episode, 'Jerry Lawler vs The Monsters' is enormously entertaining.
  You see wonderfully preserved bouts from the Mid-South Coliseum, circa mid-80's, that show Memphis' 2nd favorite son battling beasts such as Jerry Blackwell, Kamala, King Kong Bundy, and teaming with Austin Idol to face off against the relatively new tag team sensation in wrestling-The Road Warriors.
  But the highlight comes early in the DVD, when 'madman' Jos LeDuc was being interviewed on the TV set live by the great Lance Russell. Unbeknownst to Russell, or anybody else, LeDuc decided to bring his trusty axe with him that day. In front of a stunned crowd, he runs the razor sharp business end of the tool across his inside forearm, instantly creating a pool of blood. Lance, ever the pro, goes with the program. LeDuc's purpose: to publicly take a ""blood oath"" to knock Jerry Lawler out of wrestling. It may not have worked, but give him props for conviction!
  Please, ignore the other review posted here and on every single other Memphis DVD (they all say the exact same thing and award one star-the beef appears to be that he already has lots of old Memphis wrestling on tape and somehow expected to get all new material, or be magically transported back in time to the front row of the arena, so I think he sounds a bit loopy; if i had to trust somebody standing next to me with an axe, i'd much prefer Jos LeDuc!)",1308355200,3,1680,4.775862068965517
8365759,1,B002DQBYMM,"These are the discs that are possibly in a lawsuit?? They aren't worth the high price I paid for them!! Waiting all these years for Classic Memphis footage and this is what I get? My husband's VHS tapes look better than this. I already had most of it in much better quality from a different, independent website outside of Amazon.  Seems this stuff was copied. Good Luck Memphis Lovers.  Sad.",1287273600,,392,4.585714285714285

8365761,1,B002DQBYMM,"A little confused after buying the entire series of these DVDs. I thought they were going to be from master tapes or really good quality. Turns out, these are just from all the usual tapes circulating in the wrestling trade community. Nothing new here. Really disappointed. I already had most of it in much better quality from a site called 70s-tv.  Good Luck Memphis Lovers.",1287273600,,375,4.769230769230769

Hearing Lawler and the other guys talk up the card at the Mid-South Coliseum was fabulous!! If you are a Die Hard fan of Memphis Wrestling BUY THIS DVD NOW!!!!!!",1272758400,2,304,4.980392156862745
