5181979,5,B008U1ANHG,I watched this movie on hallmark channel last year. I thoroughly enjoyed it and could not wait until I could buy it on DVD. It is a wonderful story about a family coming together in the end after having some difficult and sad things happen. I don't want to give away anything but the ending is a happy one. I think that this is a very good movie for families. It has a nice clean story. No cussing or anything like that. There is a couple scenes where 2 of the characters kiss. I enjoyed this movie because it is about spending time with your family and being thankful for them. I cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone looking for a clean family Christmas movie to add to their collection. Also the young girls in the family will like the princess aspect of the movie.,1351641600,18,775,4.315068493150685
5181980,4,B008U1ANHG,"Ok, I love Christmas chic flicks with story book endings and this one did not disappoint.  As the first two reviews gave much in the details of the movies, I won't repeat what was written before.  If you are looking for a good movie with a sweet ending to add to your Christmas collection, then this movie should be considered.  I did find it at Sam's club for just under $10.  I wasn't sure if I should buy it as I hadn't checked out the reviews on Amazon first but took a chance and was glad that I did. A few rough spots (not launage or anything like that) but over all was pleased.",1351382400,6,585,4.105263157894737
5181981,5,B008U1ANHG,"I loved this movie so much the first time I saw it on Hallmark Channel last year! These are the things I loved most about them: Jules thinking of her late sister and brother-in-law's children Milo and Maddie to take them to Castleberry to meet their paternal grandfather and their uncle. Maddie softening her grandfather's heart by giving him a hug when she first meets him, giving her grandfather the Christmas tree decoration that once belonged to his brother that follows to the whole family decorating the Christmas tree, and Maddie dancing with her grandfather at the Christmas Eve ball that shows both of them are having a most wonderful Christmas. My favorite scenes with Milo are when he and his uncle Aston are spending time together (kinda in a father-son bonding) when Aston helps Milo learn to let go of his anger by giving Milo an archery lesson talking about growing up Aston had plenty in common with Milo by both of them have gotten into plenty of fights. The most moving part of Aston and Milo together is when Milo finds his late father's bedroom and Aston tells his nephew that his late father's love will always be with him. My favorite scenes with Jules in it are when Jules first meets her late brother-in-law's brother Aston and she knows it is him right away. I also like when Aston gives Jules a dancing lesson doing the waltz. To me the most amusing part of the movie is when Jules teaches Aston how to jam with rock-n-roll music because it shows to me that is when they become best friends. The most romantic part (to me at least) is when at the Christmas Eve ball, the orchestra plays the song Aston plays on his violin earlier in the movie and he refers to it as his and Jules' song when they begin waltzing then Aston follows Jules telling her how he fell in love, and their first kiss. The one part I like that shows the most self-confidence to myself is when Jules stands up to Arabella telling her that unlike Arabella, Jules and her family do not need money to make them happy. My favorite scene including Jules and the children's grandfather is towards the end of the movie when Jules tells the Duke that his late son and daughter-in-law are here with them through Milo and Maddie then the Duke tells his only son Aston that Jules is a very bright woman. To me the one part of the movie that shows me the Duke is more than ready for Jules to become his daughter-in-law is when he tells Aston to not let Jules go away. So as you can see, there are plenty of good things in this movie in case you have not seen it yet.",1349222400,45,2551,4.406779661016949
5181982,4,B008U1ANHG,"Jules works in an antique shop and serves as legal guardian for her precocious 7-year-old niece and troubled teenage nephew, whose parents have died. When the movie opens with Jules losing her job, the nephew stealing from a store, and the niece running off the nanny, I wasn't sure this was the kind of holiday ""cheer"" I needed. But a knock comes at the door and there is the mysterious man whom we have seen watching her earlier in the day.  We learn that Jules' deceased sister had married into nobility, but because she was without title, her father-in-law had disowned the couple. Now, supposedly near death, he wants to know his grandchildren and has sent the butler to fetch them to Castlebury Hall. Jules struggles with the decision of whether or not to go, but upon the arrival of the tickets for the trip in a rather timely manner, she takes that as a sign that they are to go.
At the castle it appears that the old gentleman, the duke, is not as near death's door as had been implied and Jules begins to wonder why they were summoned in the first place.
Now, if you can suspend disbelief and just enjoy the fairy tale, it is good family fun, with a little romance thrown in. You won't have to cover your ears or hide your eyes, just relax and let the Cinderella story unfold in the magical setting. I admit that the storyline was a little trite to me--stuffy, titled family turned on its ear by an outspoken, unpretentious American with cute children in the mix. The servants are all charmed by them, and there is a very predictable outcome. But it is well-played and heartwarming. Grandpa (Roger Moore) even softens and allows a Christmas tree, which he ultimately helps decorate.  There are ballet lessons, archery instructions, a fox-hunt that isn't really a fox-hunt, and a Christmas Eve Ball, where some social climbers get their comeuppance. Don't over-analyze the believability, just enjoy a good, clean holiday-themed story with emphasis on the importance of family.",1349136000,56,1985,4.717579250720461
5181983,5,B008U1ANHG,"Usually I do not see the new seasonal movies that air on Hallmark channel (or any ""cable"" network) until the following year when - and if they release to DVD. In 2011, this film was released in the U.K. and Canada, and was one I REALLY wanted to see; it was my one ""guilty pleasure"" buy. It looked so sweet and because it starred Katie McGrath from ""Merlin."" Turns out despite the fact that I shouldn't have bought it, it was well worth it.

Christmas should be a time of joy and family traditions but this Christmas should especially be a happy one, and Jules Daly (McGrath) is determined to give that to her niece and nephew. Since her sister and brother-in-law died the year prior, Jules has been trying her best to make a new home for these kids who she now looks on as her own but... Milo (Travis Turner) is a teenager who doesn't want his aunt to assert a parental authority in any part of his life while young Maddie is a seven-year-old who probably won't even remember her parents as she grows up. Just after she loses her job, a proper English butler, by Paisley Winterbottom (Miles Richardson) shows up on Jules doorstep. He has come to the states as a representative of the Duke of Castlebury Hall (Roger Moore) in order to persuade Jules to bring her niece and nephew to England in order to visit their grandfather. Unhappy about the situation, Jules refuses because she cannot see subjecting the kids to a visit with the royal in-laws who refused the existence of their son following his choice to marry a commoner - Jule's sister. After thought, Jules has a change of heart, and off the trio goes to England to spend Christmas with dukes and duchesses - and even a prince in the form of Uncle Ashton (Sam Heughan).

Confession time: I absolutely adored this movie. For practical reasons, I can't say it was because this is a sweeping epic based off a true story or because it has a beautiful spiritual bent, but because there is a fairy-tale quality that I couldn't help but love. To be honest, the movie starts out a bit rocky. In the opening frames, the director seemed to engage in a bit of awkward filming and the camera shots don't seem to do anything to compliment the actors, but once that passes - it is probably gone before fifteen minutes have passed, the viewers can settle in for an adorable, sweet little movie. The ""adventure"" of the whole movie is a lot of fun also. Jules wasn't sure that it was right to introduce Milo and Maddie to the grandfather who thought nothing of their mother, but eventually she realized that they might have the right to know their grandfather and it was that decision that led to a wonderful Christmas filled with joy - and maybe even the potential for a beautiful future.

The acting in this one was actually nothing to scoff at - Katie held her own against veteran Roger Moore (part of the James Bond fame) although as an Irish actress, there were occasions where ever the slightest hint of her accent slipped into her American dialogue. Still, she was great, plus she and Sam were really cute together. If there are any real faults or clich&eacute;s, it is in the script which can sometimes take its talent for granted. Nevertheless this is a wonderful little family film - all warm and fuzzy as it finds just the right moods of festiveness, and yet, captures a real emphasis on family and its importance. Also known as 'Christmas at Castlebury Hall' (which is what it released under in Canada) and 'A Christmas Princess' (the U.K.), this film is available in Katie's home land and is slated to release here, in America in October 2012.

Production crews found some really pretty sets (like the castle) and the camera often pans some gorgeous scenery. There is a pretty ball room scene and I was pleasantly surprised that the movie moved away from a few of the trivial expectations I had of it. If you like British productions or just happy-go-lucky romances, check into this one. I thought the ending was adorable and I liked how the characters interacted - including the servants with Jules and the kids. In that way, this movie actually reminded me (albeit very loosely) of Downton Abbey. This is definitely one of my most loved Christmas films from 2011 - I am so glad I was able to see it; A Princess for Christmas is just another charming `hallmark' of why this channel is oh-so-popular.

5182025,4,B008U1ANHG,"""A Princess for Christmas"" (2011) is an entertaining story in the ""Hallmark Christmas movie"" genre.

Katie McGrath plays the aunt and legal guardian of her dead sister's two children. Katie works as a saleswoman in an antique store and tries to provide for her adorable little niece and hostile teenage nephew.

Just as Katie experiences a financial crisis, a professional English butler arrives from Europe with an invitation: bring the kids to visit their estranged wealthy grandfather for Christmas.

Roger Moore (of ""James Bond"" fame) plays the grumpy aging grandfather, the Duke of fictional Castlebury.

Sam Heughan plays his other son, the handsome and unmarried Prince of Castlebury.

Will Roger Moore let Katie McGrath bring a big Christmas tree into the castle? Will he ever warm up to his grandchildren?

Will Sam Heughan marry his snobby royal Fiancee, who hates everything? Or will he marry Katie, who loves children AND loves Christmas?

This movie's storyline works well enough for the ""marry the prince and live happily ever after"" genre. But the ""angry teenage nephew"" character should have been toned down, because he imbalances the mood of the movie too often.

Overall, this is an enjoyable Hallmark Channel made-for-TV movie.

(Other Hallmark Christmas movies I enjoyed are ""The Christmas Ornament"" starring Kellie Martin, and ""A Royal Christmas"" starring Lacey Chabert.)",1515542400,,1392,5.319634703196347

5182252,5,B008U1ANHG,"rAs always, holiday movies are predictable for the most part. But owning more than 60 plus movies, I would like to comment that it is not always the scripet, but the look of Christmas and the Holiday season itself that most want to see.  I have watched hundreds of movies that were great, very good, good and the ones that I was not too sure how they made it as a holiday movie at all, but seeing the decorated trees, ornaments,
lighting, tinsel, songs and all that goes with Christmas makes the better ones greater. There are those that do not deserve a one star. But given that, let's lift up the spirit of Chrisrmas with the great movies and let lesser of them not spoil the mode. Predictable or not, corney or not, the majority of these movies are clean with no vulgar language, no nudity, simple truths and family oriented and that should stand for something in a world where crime, hate, off colored language and more should give us a lift during this special time of the year that we only have one chance a year to at this time to enjoy the lights, colors, glitter, the special gift of family and friends.

She was sad, and, understandably, planned a departure but she didn't let the kids know she was upset or leaving for any reason other than needing to get a new job back home.

5182308,3,B008U1ANHG,"I wanted to watch this film to see if Sam Heughan was ""all that"".  Bottom line: the beginning was rough -- almost like it was his first film -- but by the end it was a good start for him.  This is a great movie for kids/preteens, especially around the holidays.  I found it entertaining and it held my interest right through to the last frame.  So, it was predictable.  What happy ending film is not?

Characters were not all engaging, though.  Katie McGrath was cute as could be and believable as the girl with no money.  But there was little if no chemistry between her and Heughan.  Roger Moore was stiff most of the way through the film.  Was he chosen for the name?  Did he need a paycheck?  Best characters in the movie were the service staff.  Loved them!

I would love to see this movie become a holiday standard along with Home Alone and all the others.",1470700800,5,862,4.30625

5182343,5,B008U1ANHG,"Well? Here we go! I never thought for a moment when I bought this movie, it had the wonderful Sam Heughan in it. I was not an Outlander fan at the time either. Starz kept showing and talking about Season 2 and showing it so much that I thought well what the heck and checked out if I could watch Season 1. To my surprise, I could and watched the whole first 16 episode Season. It was very hard to watch 15 and 16. I had to in order to understand the series.
This movie, A Princess For Christmas is a wonderful movie! Katie McGrath did a wonderful job playing the Aunt to a couple of children who lost their parents in a car accident at Christmas time the year before. She is the sister who lost her sister. Her brother in law happened to be a son of a Duke who had nothing to do with him because he married a commoner. Time went on, after a year the Duke wants to see is grandchildren. The grandfather being played by Roger Moore. He other son is played by Sam Heughan who carries a British accent very well. I think he is British in real life. I really don't know. This is a must see movie. I won't give away any spoilers. Let's just say it is Hallmark and it does have a great ending. This being shown on Hallmark surprised me. Hallmark isn't very good at ending movies well at all. This one, they did a great job!",1461283200,2,1316,4.084942084942085

5182452,3,B008U1ANHG,"This TV movie starts with a what-else-could-possibly-go-wrong premise then continues in the same vein of improbability as an aunt and her orphaned niece and nephew are whisked off to meet the kids heretofore never seen grandfather (Roger Moore as Duke Edward of Castlebury).  Hes an overbearing Christmas hating ogre, of course.  He disowned his son for marrying a commoner and then they had the unmitigated gall to die!  For reasons undisclosed, the old geezer abruptly wants to see his grandchildren.  But!  Hes less than enthusiastic about having them there.  Its quite the jolly holiday film.  The prodigal son/brother-in-law shows up.  The kids grow out of their funk.  An unrealistic romance starts with the expected results (the DVD cover promotes a happy ending).  Its your typical prince meets commoner, prince dumps grand Lady, prince marries commoner scenario.  There are no surprises, no unexpected results.  Its all quite safe/tame.  Obligatory.",1448582400,,958,5.391891891891892

I tend to sway more toward fairy tales and non stressful movies. This one passes the test. Buffalo NY antiques store worker takes in niece and nephew after their mom and dad pass. Life hits bumpy roads and ends up with no job, car problems and credit cards maxed. The typical story of many these days. Duke (grandfather) now wants the be in the lives of the grandchildren, flies then to his palace, and interacts  with the kids.

5182522,3,B008U1ANHG,"This review won't be a long one, except to say that this film was good for what it was-a sweet little story about the importance of family and love overriding anything that has to do with social position( even though she does get the prince at the end of the story and marries him, go figure).

What I did like about the film was the cast, especially the pairing of Sam Heughan and Katie McGrath. Physically, they were a very striking pair and their chemistry, while not explosive, was very sweet ( an explosive chemistry probably would not have been that appropriate considering the type of film this was anyway). Even the scene when they first meet, you can feel the energy between them. It is palpable throughout this whole movie.  I would love to see these two in something else together, but with Mr. Heughan in Outlander I think he'll be tied up for quite some time.  I hate to say this (not really), but I like Mr. Heughan with Ms. McGrath much more than I do his pairing with Ms. Balfe; I honestly don't see the chemistry that everyone's talking about. I wish I did.",1432944000,,1074,4.441624365482234

I know people want a ""feel good"" romance for Christmas, but this went over the top for me. The heroine is so good that my teeth hurt lol! The way the adults kept harping on little 5 year old? Maddie because she liked to eat Doritos made me want to smack someone. If they had placed this movie at the North Pole (Santa DID make an appearance ha!) with magic elves in an alternate reality where ""dreams DO come true!"", I would've been better prepared on what to expect from this Hallmark travesty.

5182598,3,B008U1ANHG,"No doubt many new people are discovering this movie given the recent break-out of Sam Heughan due to Outlander.  I'll give it to you straight: this is a Hallmark Channel movie.  Check in your brain at the door and raise your level of willing suspension of disbelief because this movie is utterly corny, ridiculous and eye-rolling to boot (don't even get me started on that scene where poor Sam and Katie have the embarrassing ""dance-off"" scene to end all embarrassing dance-off scenes).  Obviously this isn't high drama and if you want to watch any of Sam's work with actual substance, check him out in the excellent A Very British Sex Scandal, Breaking the Mould, or First Light.  But if you just want to see him look pretty and watch a completely cliched over the top movie where you know it'll end happily ever after (spoiler alert! NOT), this is okay to sit through.  By the way, if any of you know where I can find a hot rich prince who looks like Sam Heughan who'll marry me and whisk me off to an amazing castle in a picturesque location where I can make out with him and wear ball gowns all day, call me please.

Sam Heughan is not only extremely attractive but his performance felt very natural despite the heavily cheesed material. The only real problem with this film was an immensely awkward ""hip-hop dance"" scene. It couldn't even be considered comedic as it was too painful to watch. Other than that, the cheese factor can be passed off as humorous.",1422403200,,482,4.819277108433735

5182641,2,B008U1ANHG,"We watched this for free on Hulu with tween girls (12 & 13 yo). Sam Heughan (Outlander) and Katie McGrath (Merlin) were the primary reasons to sit through this movie. This was bad. Sadly even bad for a Christmas movie. The movie is filled with cheesy, clich ridden lines, predictably written scenes and stereotypical happy ending outcome. Poor Sam Heughan (beloved Jamie Fraser from Outlander) was trying desperately to save this film. Sam's character comes across as flat and one dimensional. Katie (who turned in great performances as Morgan LeFay in the BBC series Merlin) couldn't pull this clunker out either. Roger Moore is so ancient as to be almost unrecognizable. If you are older than 14 be prepared to be bored. This movie works for children and will hold the attention of tweens but not adults.

5182646,5,B008U1ANHG,"I've watched this one twice now, and liked it better the second time around -- always a good sign.

It stars Katie McGrath as the aunt of a pair of kids who lost their parents and now, as Christmas approaches, she is about to lose her job.  It doesn't pay much anyway, but times are tough and she's out the door with few prospects.

But help is on the way:  the father of the two children was the son of a Duke, who invites them all to spend the holiday at the family castle in Europe.

This is a very pleasant love story, with good acting, some lovely scenery and characters that it is very easy to like (most of them --  you don't want it to be TOO easy for them, do you?)

It does adhere to more or less the usual formula of Christmas romances but it's the details that always win me over.  I liked the fact that her job was in antiques and that she could fix mechanical things and had a true love for Christmas in a place where Christmas was not very welcome. The other characters too were interesting and I find the whole business very entertaining.",1421539200,4,1054,4.157635467980295

Its a pretty typical Christmas made for tv movie.

Not a bad story, some of the acting is a little over the top, one kid in it who I remember from Marley and Me the Puppy Years is a whinny wanna be tough kid going through issues, I find him annoying but overall, my daughter loved the movie.  She really gets into the romance Christmas movies.

Good for the whole family, no harsh language or violence so very safe for all members. Only issue is a talk about death of a family member which is the big reason for the movie but nothing shown.  It is one you can watch and will probably be okay not to watch again the holiday season until next year.

He is the _only_ one in this Hallmark movie that had any acting chops, whatsoever.  Even Roger Moore was awful, and I used to love him.  The female lead was dreadful and actual painful to watch.  The two kids were right out of Stepford.  The story was no where near believeable nor cohesive nor in the least bit interesting.

This movie was not up to Hallmark standards.  They're usually just a sappy bit of fluff, which I usually enjoy.  This one was just embarrassing to watch.",1416614400,5,584,4.443396226415095

I received it very fast and as always with anything I buy from Amazon, I am very pleased with it. The movie itself is great, it is fun to watch, its romantic, funny, humorous and a wonderful cast.",1414195200,,317,3.96875
5182761,3,B008U1ANHG,"Full disclaimer: I bought this because Sam Heughan is in it & I knew what I was getting into before I bought it...
As far as Christmas movies go, it's on par. It's super cheesy, but in a feel-good way. It lays it on a little thick, but then again, the title alone will let you know you're going to need to suspend all forms of reality. And honestly, that is one of the best aspects of Christmas movies.
If I was a 13 year old girl I would love this movie. Charming hero, fairy tale set up, lovely scenery, happy ending with just enough sorrow early on to make it wrap up perfectly for my tween heart. So for it's intended audience it's probably a winner.
The hardest thing I had with the movie was the acting. I'll admit, there's little to work with as the script is pretty cliche riddled, but still. Katie McGrath is almost unwatchable. I mean, really, I started fast forwarding & cringing whenever she looked about to speak. Even Roger Moore was overacting in the extreme. And don't even get me started on the painful angst filled drama that is Travis Turner.  Ugh. I know I'm biased, but honestly Sam Heughan, Charlotte Salt & Miles Richardson are the only ones in the entire production who appear to actually understand how to play a role. And the accents! I couldn't understand where this country was supposed to be as every character had a different, bizzare accent! If you're a Heughan fan, it's worth watching just to see how he has changed & evolved as an actor but also to see some of the facial gestures & mannerisms he has retained. Otherwise, unless there are romantic tweens in your house, I'd say wait till it's on tv at Christmas time",1414108800,2,1650,4.427631578947368

5182865,4,B008U1ANHG,"I think by now you've figured out the plot from various reviews. I will spare the minutiae and try to focus on some of the key elements. Is it a good film? Is it well-acted? Is it well-written?

It is a Hallmark holiday movie, made for television. I will say right away you'd better not come into this expecting Oscar material. The writing is definitely rather weak, but it comes together very nicely, surprisingly so in fact. There are a few moments and performances that fall a little flat, but everything is saved by Katie McGrath and Sir Roger Moore.

Starting with Moore, he shines. He absolutely shines in this role, and brings a kind of dignity that the film truly needs.

Katie McGrath, however is another pleasant surprise. I had watched her role as Morgana in Merlin, and had seen nothing else of her. How would she act? How would her performance be, as an actress who started as a history student? Despite receiving some rather poor dialogue to perform, Katie did a stellar performance. She had great heart, and clearly put a great deal of emotion and effort into her role, all while maintaining an American accent.

What would have been another generic and forgettable Hallmark seasonal movie has earned a place in my Christmas tradition thanks to these performances, and of course a very, very infectious smile.

In all good faith I cannot say five stars. But four is perfectly fair.",1388707200,,1396,4.704918032786885

5182885,5,B008U1ANHG,"We watched this film last year because it had Roger Moore in it. While Moore was convincing as the crotchety and bitter European noble, we found so much ... well, more ... in this film, and when it played on the Hallmark Channel again this year, we watched it again.

The plot is nothing revolutionary. There are orphans whose father was a disowned European noble. Their guardian and Aunt (mother's sister) is a struggling antiques sales lady on the verge of being laid off. Their Uncle (father's brother) is charming and impossibly wise, patient, and sympathetic. There is the strict head housekeeper, and of course the kids are painful screw-ups. Every clich&eacute; you'd imagine might be in a story like this is in fact in this story.

Yet it works.

It mostly works because Sam Heughan, as the impossibly wise, patient, and sympathetic uncle nailed his performance and gives you nothing but good vibes from the moment he first appears in the film. No misunderstanding, false accusation, outlandish behavior, or clumsy accident by the other characters is beyond his ability to put right, and in short order. Everyone would like to be that guy. LOL

Now in his late 80s, Roger Moore looks good for his age and his acting hasn't suffered from his advanced years. We appreciated another opportunity to see this actor who we have enjoyed so much for so many decades.

Katie McGrath seemed a bit out of her depth in this role, giving what at times seemed to be a nervous performance (as opposed to showing the nervousness of her character). Still, she was engaging and gave an enjoyable performance.

So while this made for TV film has some short-comings, they are not severe enough to seriously detract from the overall impression this enjoyable if sentimental story will make on you.

Highly recommended.",1387324800,3,1805,4.859934853420196

Add to that the stern housekeeper who completely changes her persona immediately after seeing a Christmas tree and the cutely under-stairs staff. And the totally inevitable ending.

Jules becomes the guardian to her niece Maddie and nephew Milo. Not only is she still getting used to being a parent, but she is laid off at work, her car just broke down again and the kid's just caused yet another nanny to quit.  That night Paisley comes with a message from Edward the Duke of Castlebury Hall, her niece and nephew's grandfather who disowned their father when he married their mother because she had no title or fortune.  They are invited to spend Christmas at the castle.  Since Jules doesn't know how to handle all the problems going on, she accepts.  The grandfather is not the kindest gentleman, still mourning the loss of his son, even though he is the one that sent him away, and he doesn't seem the least bit sorry.  However, even though the children seem to remind him even more of his first-born son, they eventually win him over, along with Jules, and remind him of happier times and that his son is still here in his children.  Ashton, the duke's second son, is almost engaged to a girl, who things Jules, Milo and Maddie are beneath their class.  However Ashton is drawn to the three and helps Milo let go of his anger and they all learn move on.  Edward, Ashton, Jules, Milo and Maddie stay together and become the family they thought they had lost.

5182962,2,B008U1ANHG,"Given the amount of five-star reviews for ""A Princess for Christmas"", I realize I'm risking an onslaught of negative votes by giving it only two, but the truth will out. Having been a long-time fan of the BBC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B001LF347E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>, and knowing that Katie McGrath (aka Morgana) starred in this, I decide to check it out. Also released as ""Christmas at Castlebury"" and ""A Christmas Princess"", this is a typical Hallmark Christmas movie, which means the entire film can be described in a word: saccharine.

sac*cha*rine (adjective)

1 a: of, relating to, or resembling that of sugar <saccharine taste> b: yielding or containing sugar <saccharine vegetables>

2: overly or sickishly sweet <saccharine flavor>

3: ingratiatingly or affectedly agreeable or friendly

4: overly sentimental: mawkish <a saccharine love story>

Like many other young attractive single women who star in these types of movies, Jules Daly (Katie McGrath) has been burdened with her dead sister and brother-in-law's children. She's a cute, clumsy girl who trips over everything, breaks almost anything she touches, and can't even drive down her straight driveway without crashing into trashcans. D'aww. Like many other heart-warming orphans of their ilk, Milo and Maddy are precocious and adorable, but also a little troubled. Milo (Travis Turner - who was in his mid-twenties when this was filmed, believe it or not) is a delinquent because he steals an R-rated DVD from the rental store and then commits the crime of telling his little sister that there's no Santa, whilst Maddy (Leilah de Meza) gets up to some cutesy hi-jinks that result in the nanny quitting.

So Jules is faced with no job, no nanny and two upset orphaned children - AT CHRISTMAS! Luckily for them, a contrived plot device is on the way. The children's grandfather Lord Huntingdon (Roger Moore) has decided that he wants to see the children of his estranged son before he dies (even though he doesn't seem hugely interested in them once they arrive) and his butler - you can tell what is his occupation is by the fact that he's given the name Paisley Winterbottom - arrives at Jules's house to issue the invitation. Seeing no better prospects, Jules agrees.

So Jules, Milo and Maddy arrive in an unspecified European country where everyone has an obscure accent and yet behaves like a stereotypical stuffy English aristocrat. At the grand castle of Castlebury (which is a bit like calling a town Townsville) the children meet their grandfather, who tells them over dinner that their mother was an unworthy match for his son because she had no title. It's actually pretty funny at how casually he shares this fact, and how nonchalantly the kids take it.

Also present is Lord Huntington's second son Ashton (Sam Heughan), who tells Jules that he's a prince on his (deceased) mother's side - which makes absolutely no sense if you think about it. Lord Huntington never actually verbalises: ""the wrong son died!"" but the implication is there, and he caps off the joyous family reunion by informing everyone that there will be no Christmas tree in his house.

Naturally, free-spirited Jules and the wide-eyed kiddies win him over, and in about two seconds Gramps is helping them decorate a newly-bought Christmas tree. Since this occurs at the half-way mark of the film, the writers have to scramble for another conflict. And so after a lengthy dance montage to pad out the running-time, out trots Ashton's snotty love interest, an upper-class cow who wants to get her claws into the prince, and that indispensable tool of any romantic-comedy: the overheard conversation that is completely misunderstood by the eavesdropper.

Mistakenly believing that Gramps and Ashton think she's crass and unworthy, Jules makes a dash for the airport, but is coaxed back by the staff, who have been won over by her American charm and all contributed to a new dress for her to wear to the ball. So she gets her requisite slow stair walk and dance with prince charming, only for snotty love interest to try and sabotage everything by revealing the shocking truth to the assembly: Jules is unemployed! Milo stole a DVD! Maddy eats too many crisps! How she knows any of this is a mystery, but it turns out that no one really cares, and so they live happily ever after with a cameo from Santa and a fairytale wedding. Yay!

Okay, so it's easy to make fun of a movie that aspires to be nothing more than the filmic equivalent of candy-floss and toffee. So, I'll give it this: ""A Princess for Christmas"" is a totally harmless and inoffensive film, and Katie McGrath is effervescent. Bless her, I'm sure on some level she knew she was in a terrible TV movie, but damn it if she isn't going to try and sell every single trite line and corny scene she's given. It's a typical Cinderella story filmed in and around the beautiful Peles Castle in Romania, and it's perfectly safe for kids, with no violence, language or other questionable content. So you probably already know whether or not this is for you - a fluffy fairytale that makes very little sense and is packed full of clichs, but is certainly very pretty to look at.",1359676800,9,5256,4.980615735461802

5183022,4,B008U1ANHG,"Some reviewers have been bored by this film.
What did they expect? The title is either a deliberate lie, or the film is about a Princess and Christmas!
It is a story that virtually writes itself, especially after the first few scenes.
But what follows is NOT great suspense. It's ""How will they get together and heal the family?""
Finding out HOW can be as engaging as cliff-hanging thrills or high drama -- but you have to be willing to go along for the ride.

You have to overlook the fact that Roger Moore is in his eighties, and looks it, but is supposed to have a son in his young thirties or late twenties. (Biologically possible, but unusual.) Fortunately Moore can still speak and act with authority, so his screen presence outweighs the wrinkles and thin colored hair.

You have to overlook the fact that a supposedly European castle and aristocratic titles are decidely English, at least in language.
Similarly you have to overlook the fact that almost all the Christmas carols are traditional British, and the village orphan choir sings in English.

You have to overlook the fact that the waltz the two young-people-destined-for-each-other dance to, which the young man has declared is, or is about to be, ""their song"", is the classic Wedding Waltz (""Oh, how we danced, on the night, we were wed, ..."") This can be off-set by the soulful way the young man as been inspired, earlier, by his sudden feelings for the young girl to begin playing his violin again: Jules Massanet's haunting ""Meditation"", from the opera ""Thais"".

You have to overlook the way Vivaldi violin concertos, from ""The Four Seasons"", are used as background music, but not credited in the list of music used in the film. (But I am a pedant who looks for these details.)

This may seem a lot of overlooking.

But the film says ""Christmas"" very early and clearly.
It also says, ""Family mourning"", and ""family schism"", and ""hope for redemption, forgiveness, and reconciliation"".
So we have many emotionally convincing reasons to overlook trivial matters.

We should also overlook the way this situation replays the better made, slightly more plausible ""Princess Diaries"".

In short, this film works well enough.
For me it is FOUR STARS because FIVE must be reserved for really GREAT Christmas family-healing, and romance-fixing, films such as ""Silver Bells"" and ""The Christmas Card"" almost any version of ""A Christmas Carol"" and ""Miracle on 34th Street"".

But FOUR STARS are fine!

One final nice joke: mid-way through, American antique-expert maiden versus snobby prince-chasing would-be princess: as water cress and cucumber sandwiches are served after the drag-scent mock fox hunting, the American girl identifies the designer of the sandwich plate, but the snobby girl claimns this is wrong. Once the American girl leaves, a sympathetic fellow turns over the plate -- the American girl was write, this is a (I forget the name) ""Lindsay Whatever"". At the end, if you watch the credits closely, ""Lindsay Whatever"" is actually one of the Assistant Producers.

Incidentally, Wikipedia states that the film was shot at Pele Castle, Stirbei Castle, the Bragadiru Palace, and in a Romanian film studio.",1355443200,2,3176,4.996212121212121

The storyline is about a woman who takes care of her neice and nephew after their parents die.  Near Christmas she finds out the children's estranged grandfather who is a duke wants to meet them.  When they arrive, the children also meet their uncle the prince, and it's obvious from the start there is an attraction between the children's aunt and uncle.  Unfortunately he is promised to another woman (who of course is completely unsuitable for him).  There are a lot of lovely moments between the two lead characters, and she brings out his fun (less stuffy) side.  The whole movie is very charming, and has a fairytale quality about it.

The only other problem I had was with the wardrobe... when the Princess was to make her grand entrance, and she was on the top of the stairs with all eye on her.... she should have made your heart flutter a bit.

Roger Moore is fantastic, and the male lead reminds me of Cary Elwes so I can't find any fault with him. :)  I wish they had more money for wardrobe and hair/make-up.  Sometimes it looked like the actors did it all themselves.

The real gem here is what I believe to be Peles Castle in Romania, used for the exteriors.  It onced belonged to the Romanian royal family.  I'm not sure if they also used the castle for interiors as well.  The pictures I've seen don't match up to anything in the movie.  The interiors are great though, and seem really authentic.

5183036,5,B008U1ANHG,"All right -- I admit it -- I'm a sucker for a happy family ending/new beginning.  But this movie has a charm that I can't quite describe.  Maybe it's the orphaned children meeting their Grandfather and Uncle Ashton for the first time.  Maybe it's the casting (Ashton actually looks like a young Roger Moore--shockingly so!).  I love Jules' smile and optimism in the midst of trying circumstances.  Little Maddie and young Milo are so precocious.

The blending of this broken family into a cohesive whole is a thing of beauty to watch.  They forgive each other and grow together inch by inch in this heartwarming drama.  I like believing in Miracles.  I love this movie because its packed to the brim with them!",1354406400,4,710,4.7073170731707314
5183037,4,B008U1ANHG,"Each year, 'round the holiday season, the Hallmark Channel trots out its run of enjoyable Christmas family films. A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS, which debuted in 2011, stands out from the assembly line, for me, anyway. I'm a sucker for any spin on that classic Cinderella fairy tale. And, yeah, while the resolutions to all the story conflicts are arrived at rather too conveniently, it's such a watchable picture that the flaws become easily forgiveable.

In Buffalo, New York, Jules Daly (Katie McGrath) is a top notch salesgirl at the struggling shop Buffalo Antiques & Stuff. Jules is the young aunt to troubled teen Milo (Travis Turner) and 7-year-old Maddie (Leilah de Meza), and since her sister and brother-in-law passed away last Christmas, she's become the kids' legal guardian, as well. Understandably, the arrival of this new Christmas doesn't sit well with any of them. The final straw is when Jules gets let go from her job.

At home Jules wallows in misery but then responds to a knock on the door. Outside stands the dignified English butler, Paisley Winterbottom.

- Jules: ""I thought butlers were extinct.""
- Paisley Winterbottom: ""Oh, no, we've made a comeback. P. Diddy has three.""

And this is when we learn that Jules' sister had married into royalty, her husband being the disowned son of an English lord. Jules is informed that the aged Duke of Castlebury Hall (Roger Moore) is at death's door and wishes to see his grandchildren for the holidays. A fiery Jules initially wants no truck with the royal nibs what had turned his back on her family. But times are desperate...

In England Jules and the kids arrive at an imposing castle stocked with a full assembly of beaming servants (okay, not all the servants were beaming). The awed Yanks find themselves in elegant surroundings, except that it's a residence in which the spirit of Christmas isn't observed. The old Duke is bitter and foul-tempered and cannot countenance holiday cheer. He's having second thoughts about his inviting over his estranged grandchildren from across the pond. You see, the kids dredge up too many sad memories of his dead son. His second and lesser favored son, the dashing Prince Ashton, has also dropped by for a visit. So there's even more of that stiff-upper-lipped forced politeness going on. Prince Ashton has brought along his snooty girlfriend who takes an immediate dislike to Jules. And, old as you are in the ways of romantic cinema, you sense where that narrative is going.

A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS tells of the mending of a family rift. It tells of the thawing of a miserable regal curmudgeon, and the bonds that grow amongst the castle residents, and, of course, it tells of a fairy tale type romance. There's hokey stuff, plenty of it, but there's also so much warmth and the cast is very appealing. Katie McGrath, whom you may best know as Morgana from MERLIN, effortlessly shines. She creates some nice sparks with Sam Heughan who plays the surprisingly down-to-earth prince. There's a thoroughly cute sequence that encompasses three rooms: one in which Maddie studies ballet, another in which Milo practices electric guitar, and a third room in which Ashton teaches Jules the waltz which then devolves into Jules and the prince's funking it out to hip-hop music. This scene could've gone down real cheesy if the actors weren't so good and natural in the moment. In fact, that scene embodies how I feel about the film. It could so very easily have strayed into cringe-inducing hokum territory. But it manages to sidestep all potential pitfalls. With regards to modern takes on Cinderella, A PRINCESS FOR CHRISTMAS ranks as one of the more terrific ones.",1354406400,6,3671,4.912903225806452
5183038,5,B008U1ANHG,"My mom and I watched it last year when it premiered on Hallmark Channel and immediately fell in love with it.  This combines healing from a hurtful past, the joy of Christmas, and of course, romance.  The cast fit perfectly together.  How the characters evolve through the movie was perfectly written and played out.  I'm glad it's on DVD so we can watch it over and over.  This easily is one of my favorite Christmas movies and is without a doubt, a new Christmas classic.  I really hope that a sequel will be greatly considered.",1354406400,2,530,4.526315789473684

5183048,5,B008U1ANHG,"So happy to see this available on DVD.  This is a lovely little film that charms as both a fairy tale and a Christmas tale.  It has all the elements of ""once upon a time""...the wealthy Prince and his curmudgeon of a father suffering from an overabundance of class pride and guilt over the loss he's suffered because of that pride, the beautiful young woman (Aunt Jules) who is rescued in the nick of time, the romance.  Most of the movie takes place at ""Castlebury Hall"", a beautiful, old castle filled with priceless things (the kinds of things the heroine, Jules, has loved since childhood) set in a snowy, mountain landscape that creates a sense of age and timelessness.

It's also a story about family and courage. Because side by side with the fairy tale is an aunt with few resources struggling to help a teenage nephew and young niece deal with the death of their parents the previous Christmas.  Prince Ashton and Jules are ""beautiful people"", but their happily ever after is reached without excessive drama after learning to genuinely like each other.  And, while it's apparent from the start that Jules and the children need a little help, by the end of the film it's also obvious they have much to give.

One of my favorite aspects of the Christmas fairy tale journey of this family is the movie's humor.  Roger Moore's dry, sometimes sarcastic, British wit is as good as it ever was.  Don't think I'll ever forget the phrase ""all fur coat and no knickers"" he uses to describe one of the characters who's all outer class with nothing underneath.

A Princess for Christmas is a movie with heart that I anticipate enjoying many times.",1352246400,8,1643,4.653979238754325
