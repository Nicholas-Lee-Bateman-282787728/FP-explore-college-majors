7876730,3,6304713061,"I feel almost obligated to weigh in on this one, having read the reviews.  Most of those, I see, were resoundingly negative, which is not surprising.  But, having watched upwards of 300 foreign films (and that's a modest estimate), I feel peculiarly qualified to pass judgment.  Folks, you need to understand something:  This is a FOREIGN FILM.  Get that--FOREIGN FILM.  The rules that apply to Hollywood and American productions in general most definitely do not apply to foreign offerings, whether or not they feature an American actor/actress.  I will have to say that among all the various films I've watched, the Italian are usually the most charming, warm and quirkily human, and there is certainly something of that warmth and that human depth in this little number.  Yes, I'm aware that it's disjointed here and there, and that the comedy it seems to be at the beginning is not borne out by the middle or the end.  In fact, it almost seems two films in one.  But the trick to appreciating foreign film lies, like most other worthwhile pursuits, in practice.  I began practicing on my college campus over thirty years ago, and I feel that building an understanding of other countries' perspectives has been one of the most worthwhile investments of my life.  No, this is not a great film, and it is definitely an oddball outing for an actress like Hawn, but I admire her for having run the risk.  It is certainly worth watching one time, and possibly a second.  Refrain from judging it by American film-making standards and you may find it to be a pleasant little treasure.",1473206400,2,1580,4.761029411764706
7876731,3,6304713061,"This really is not a good movie, but I remember seeing it when it first came out on VHS and I still enjoy it. Goldie Hawn isn't really very good in it, as if her heart wasn't in it. The movie is really all about Giancarlo Giannini, who I love.  I don't recommend this unless you love Giancarlo and Goldie, because the writing is really not great. Some good scenery.",1456012800,,365,4.214285714285714

7876733,1,6304713061,"Don't waste your time or money on this one.  With Goldie Hawn and Giancarlo Giannini together (two of my all time favorites and both very funny people and fine actors, I thought this would be one hysterical movie, but I was wrong.  It is not a comedy at all, and you will be very dissapointed if that is what you are expecting.  Also, the quality of the video is not good.  It's very dark.",1021852800,17,389,4.216216216216216
7876734,5,6304713061,"This is a weird little, low-budget, foreign film that oddly enough is the best movie I've ever seen Goldie Hawn in.  My wife is a big fan of Goldie, so--by osmosis--I've ended up seeing her in all her movies, and I swear, this one is funniest, in a low key sort of way.  It's about this world-weary, chain smoker, bag-eyed, married guy, who drives to his dad's house (the dad is dying) and takes Goldie along--he finds her at his mistress's house.  The movie has got this nice lightness/freshness/breeziness to it that most movies no longer have, and you get odd glimpses of Italy as it was 30 years ago.  The DVD unfortunately isn't wide screen, the print is less than spectacular, the soundtrack sounds like it has been badly dubbed, there is no scatalogical humor, there are no wonderful special features, but oddly enough you will feel utterly wonderfully, satisfied, and amused, when you finish with this charming little DVD.",1003363200,34,930,4.75776397515528
