8277622,5,B001AI774I,Loved the fact that it had three different episodes on it. Surprised even me. The title leads you to believe that it will be only one but there are three just the right length of time to keep the little one occupied.,1265155200,,216,4.166666666666667
8277623,4,B001AI774I,"This is a release that I give enough justice. The episodes are priceless. They all include humor and fun and the spoofs are funny, but i would like to see more episodes on one DVD. I found it funny how every chipette that was really the main featuring one (hence Eleanor being the mayor in Robomunk) was Brittany. I have a slight feeling they did this on purpose. Maybe not i don't know, I just found it funny. Over all this is a good release for any true old chipmunk fan. And the collection wouldn't be complete without it.",1234828800,3,525,4.313131313131313
8277624,3,B001AI774I,"In this 1-disc 3-episode Dvd from the eigth and final season of Alvin and the Chipmunks called The Chipmunks Go to the Movies, Alvin and the Chipmunks spoof an Indianna Jones movie (no one in particular), Batman (1989), and the original Robocop in roughly 20-minute episodes.

*In the Indy spoof, called Daytona Jones and the Pearl of Wisdom, Alvin is Daytona Jones, Simon is Daytona's brother, Seri-Toga, Theodore is someone who gets mixed up in Daytona's quest for the Pearl of Wisdom, and Brittany (the Chipette who's like Alvin) is the main antagonist, Bellyache's girlfriend. Episode Summary; Daytona Jones goes into an ancient temple, finds the last half of the Tasmanian Oyster, which is half of a map to the Pearl of Wisdom, and dodges a giant stone head (like in Indianna Jones and the Arc of the Covenant), only to have the Oyster stolen by Bellyache and his ninjas. Later, using the first half of the Oyster, Daytona and Seri-Toga journey to China, meet Theodore's character, meet Bellyache's girlfriend, then sneak onto Bellyache's ship, where they are captured. Will the Chipmunks escape and get the Oyster back? Or will Bellyache get the upper hand on Daytona once again?

*In the Batman spoof, called Batmunk, Simon is Brice Wayne/Batmunk, Theodore is Happy, the Butler, Alvin is The Jokester, and Brittany is Nicky Nale. Episode Summary; Brice Wayne, a millionaire has had several attempted robberies on his toy stores where his famous Batmunk action figures are. The villan behind these robberies is the Jokester, and with Brice's greatest toy soon to be unvailled, his superhero alter-ego, Batmunk will be working overtime. Will he be enough?

*In the Robocop spoof, called Robomunk, Alvin is officer Mallone, Brittany is Violet, his partner, Simon is Dr. Simonize, Eleanor is the mayor, and Theodore is the villan, Mr. Pinckie. Episode Summary; In the future, Mr. Pinckie dreams of creating his own ideal town by polluting the city, but Officers Mallone and Violet, the best cops out there, are standing in his way. But when Mallone suffers a ""terrible"" accident, the struggling, and soon-to-be-fired Dr. Simonize transforms him into a half-cyborg half-chipmunk Robomunk, who has no memories of his former life and lives only to fight crime and pollution. Soon, Mr. Pinckie invents a superior, pollution-causing robot. In the end, will Robomunk be enough? Or will Mr. Pinckie take over the city.

In my opinion, this is a fair DVD. The episodes have the same general plot as the movies they are based off, only without the bad language or violence. I'd recommend this for children 7 and up (though it is a children's show show) and their parents who have seen the actual films.",1232064000,8,2696,4.997772828507795
8277625,4,B001AI774I,"Although it does need to be said that the way in which Chipmunks TV episodes are being released on DVD seems disorganized, and is probably very frustrating to anyone who bought the first Chipmunks Go to the Movies disc (which includes 2 episodes that have since been released AGAIN), that doesn't mean that this DVD deserves a bad rating.  I found the episodes included here very entertaining, and would definitely recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen them.

I know a lot of fans of the Chipmunks series are going to keep complaining and bashing Paramount until they release an uncut mega box set of all 8 seasons.  Since that's unlikely to ever happen, I think we should be at least somewhat grateful that we're getting these Movies episodes at all.  My main complaint is that so far they've only released the same episodes that have already been made available before (mostly on VHS in the 90s).  I would love to see some of the more elusive titles from the Go to the Movies season in future.",1224892800,,996,4.604519774011299
8277626,1,B001AI774I,"I am disappointed in the latest reissue of ""Chipmunks Go To the Movies"" The only new addition would be ""The Pearl of Wasdom"" toon. I ALREADY own BATMUNK and the other cartoon on another DVD. The art is nice on the box, but Paramount really needs to get their act together and release cartoons that younger fans haven't seen...

It is a real shame to see how Parmount has done a terrible injustice to the Chipmunks and how the shows are being released to DVD.  I am about ready to stop buying the DVDs... I passed on this release.. I rented this from my library and was disappointed...",1221091200,3,584,4.398148148148148
