It's very well produced with much clear explanations and easy to follow and understand. I think most people of all levels can take advantages of it and learn how to use the can mouvements properly. Very enjoying and useful!",1373155200,,366,4.318840579710145

She makes learning the cane very easy and especially interesting - again, because I didn't care for cane dancing.  This DVD will definitely make me want to learn and perfect the cane dance.  I hope I can become as smooth and graceful as Virginia.",1343433600,4,368,4.7936507936507935
8404863,4,B003T05SYQ,This video is wonderful for an intro to cane dancing. I loved it. My favorite part is the folkloric steps. The choreography is great for beggining belly dancers too. I really enjoyed that she gives you the elements of twirling and techniques as well as a seperate section for the folkloric foot patterns. This enables a dancer to drill these movements and take it to the floor for improv if so desired. Lovely :),1308182400,7,412,4.581081081081081
