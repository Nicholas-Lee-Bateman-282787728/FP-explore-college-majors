2527566,5,B000EQ5TTW,"The absolute best DVD. Our favorite ""Ridin The Range"" is on here!!! And the surfin episode is ""RAD DUDE""!! My daughter (who is 2) loves this show and I have to admit so do I!!!!! My wife thinks I like it more than our little one! It's the best kid show out there. Most of these shows nowadays are pretty annoying but I could watch these over and over. Dora is my daughters favorite, but she loves the backyardigans 2. You have to get these movies because they are the best out there for kids and adults too. Hopefully the Backyardigans keep on going for a long time because nothing beats em!!",1154044800,,592,4.294642857142857
2527567,5,B000EQ5TTW,"Great selection. My daughter loves Backyardigan's, they can keep her enraptured for hours if I allow it! All the episodes are worth watching.",1153958400,,141,5.173913043478261
2527568,5,B000EQ5TTW,This movie is lots of fun.  My little ones watch it and love it.  My older children even sit and watch it sometimes with the little ones.,1153785600,,137,4.037037037037037
2527569,5,B000EQ5TTW,"My [...] daughter loves The Backyardigans since she was 17 months old, and so I am.
Like some of other reviewers, we have all 5 Backyardigans DVDs at home, and I (and my daughter) think THIS IS THE BEST ONE.
I personally do not like the first one, ""Surf's up!"", but the other 3 episodes are GREAT!! Especially, flying rock episode has wonderful story, dance and music ('70s disco music!).
If you do not know about Backyardigans well but looking for their DVD, I recommend to buy this one and ""The Snow Fort"" DVD.",1153267200,,512,4.457446808510638
2527570,5,B000EQ5TTW,"I'd say that out of the Backyardigans DVDs that are out now, this one trumps them all.

If you're clueless, the Backyardigans is a show about 5 preschool kids (Tyrone, a moose; Tasha, a hippo; Pablo, a penguin; Austin, a kangaroo; and Uniqua, a.....um.....unique....looking pink.....person) using their imaginations in their backyard to go to other places (the places represented are the Wild West, a beach, a jungle/desert setting, and a large tower).  What makes this show rise above most other kids' shows are its addictive music and its comical moments, as well as its choreographed dance numbers, which compliment the music nicely.  It's definately safe viewing for the kiddies.

So the four episodes represented here are:

Surf's Up - Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua search for a beach with awesome waves.  But will Lifeguard Austin lead them to it?  Music - Afro-Cuban/Surfing style

Riding the Range - Cowboy Tyrone is heading to a Wild West party, while Cowpokes Uniqua, Pablo, and Tasha are looking for a theiving bandit.  Will their trails cross?  Music - Hip-Hop

Race to the Tower of Power - The key to the world is hidden in the Tower of Power, and superheroes Captain Hammer (Austin) and Weather Woman (Uniqua) must prevent supervillians Yucky Man (Pablo) and Dr. Shrinky (Tyrone....complete with long rubber gloves!) from obtaining the key and ruling the world.  Music - Latin

Quest for the Flying Rock - It's another race, as the legend of Stone Step Hill states that a flying rock awaits those who undertake a perilous quest.  Pablo and Tyrone take the desert path in an attempt to beat Tasha and Uniqua, who are going through the jungle.  Music - Disco

All in all, the episodes are great viewing for the kids, and there's enough comical undertones to keep the adults entertained (if you grew up during the disco years, I dare you to watch ""Quest for the Flying Rock"" and not laugh at the dance moves they use).

There's also bonus content of Tasha and Tyrone dancing (to the tunes of ""Shake Your Body"" and ""Dance By the Light of the Moon"", respectively) and previews for some of Nick Jr.'s other shows (like Dora and Diego).

Two complaints that I have (and they don't have to do with the shows themselves) - one, the DVDs don't come with any subtitles on them.  I can get around them by using the closed-captioning function on my TV, but still.  It's a very minor complaint.  And two, sometimes the DVDs are made very poorly, not allowing you to view other features.  It's not present on this DVD, but it is on my ""Cave Party"" DVD, and viewing complaints from other customers, it's imperative that Paramount get on the ball and fix this.

Regardless, if you have little ones, you will not be disappointed, and you'll get quite a bit of wear out of this DVD.  My son and I have.",1152489600,30,2792,4.697530864197531
2527571,5,B000EQ5TTW,My girls love these videos and I have to admit I watch them with them all time. We are a backyardigans family for sure.,1151798400,,119,4.0
2527572,5,B000EQ5TTW,"Sadly we have now come to the end of this wonderful musical series created by Janice Burgess.  We own all five DVDs, and the first one ""It's Great to be a Ghost"" is still a regular on our play list, as are the others.

This one has four episodes as usual, two of which were also included in the Nick Jr Favorites DVDs.  The list for this one is:

Surf's Up: Pablo, Tyrone and Uniqua brush up their ""rad"" surfing moves in order to ride the perfect wave at Tiki Beach, but who is that mysterious lifeguard?

Riding the Range: Tyrone is on his way to Texas, and meets up with Pablo, Uniqua and Tasha who're tracking down a jump-rope bandit.

Race to the Tower of Power: Two supervillains battle it out with two superheroes for possession of the Key to the World and with it, world domination. Whahahahhahaha!!

The Quest for Flying Rock: Four explorers quibble over the directions on a mysterious map, and end up having an obstacle race.

This series is highly recommended for children of all ages, and is one of the most imaginative and entertaining at the moment.  If some of the other shows make you want to put on earplugs and run out of the room, you'll find this one a refreshing change.

Please Ms. Burgess, may we have some more?

Ridin on the Range is really great too, I liked the updated version of Buffalo Gals. Honestly I haven't seen much of the other 2 shows because but even though I ended up listening to Ho Daddy about 20 times in one day I didn't get tired of it.

I actually want to watch more of the series to see how they use music and also the adventures they get into.  This is not annoying music, and when I got ""riding the range, riding the range, yahoo!"" stuck in my head it wasn't that bad.",1292889600,,730,4.020689655172414
2527735,5,B000EQ5TTW,"I'm a parent, and my daughter loves the Backyardigans. It was the first show that really got her attention when she wasn't even a year old. In the last 3 years, -I've- gotten into the Backyardigans, and know nearly all the songs by heart. This dvd contains some of the most memorable episodes and songs, and that's saying a lot considering how catchy so many of them are.

Surf's Up is the episode where Pablo's looking for the perfect wave on Tiki Beach. While searching, he joins up with Tyrone and Uniqua, while being followed by the mysterious lifeguard, Austin. The music for this episode is Afro-pop, and very cool. And you gotta love those super super rad, totally rad moves the gang shows off on their boards.

Riding the Range has Tyrone going to a hoedown while Uniqua, Pablo and Tasha look for a bandit. The music here is more hip-hop, and it's great having Tyrone hopping along with those smooth hoedown moves to the beat. Ridin' the range, let's go! This episode has a little bit of western action involving horses too!

Then there are the two 'bonus' episodes. I don't like how they're listed as bonus episodes when they could just say that this dvd has 4 regular episodes. These two are Race to the Tower of Power and The Quest for the Flying Rock. Tower of Power is a cool superhero episoe where Tyrone and Pablo are the bad guys, and Uniqua and Austin are the heroes trying to stop them from doing bad guy-type things. Music genre for this episode = Latin. Finally is my favorite episode of the bunch, and one of my top episodes, the Flying Rock. The gang looks for a magical flying rock (yeah, it doesn't actually give you powers, it's just a small, flying rock that they want to go see) and splits up into two teams, trying to beat eachother to it. This is a kind of boys vs girls episode with insanely good disco music. The first song and dance in this episode needs to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It's right up there with Thriller I tell you.

If you don't have cable and want to give your child a shot with the show, I highly recommend this dvd because of the music and episode theme diversity. Though that goes for most of the other Backyardigans dvds, I guess I'm just biased because this one has the Flying Rock episode. 5 stars, easy.",1268438400,8,2281,4.410926365795724

2527739,4,B000EQ5TTW,"Surfs Up is the episode that introduced us to the Backyardigans and where my children fell in love with Pablo.  I enjoy the music being rhythmic enough to be able to listen to on very long road trips without making you want to stop and change it every time it is done playing.

This is the movie that my littlest child loves to dance too.  She is very shy but doesn't care who is around when this video is playing, just ignoring us and dancing!",1233705600,,444,4.2
2527740,5,B000EQ5TTW,All of these episodes are awesome!  The songs are great.  Definitely glad to have this in our collection!,1222732800,,105,4.777777777777778
2527741,5,B000EQ5TTW,I bought this DVD for my 9-month old son.  He absolutely loves the Surfs Up episode.  I love it just as much if not more!  The songs are very catchy and I find myself singing the music even when he is not around.  The Backyardigan DVDs are very entertaining.,1215820800,,258,4.204081632653061
2527742,5,B000EQ5TTW,"The Backyardigans did it again.  Themes of working together, using your imagination and singing throughout the adventure.  I swear my daughter is singing twice as much now.",1213228800,,172,5.333333333333333
2527743,4,B000EQ5TTW,"The Backyardigans have taken it to the waves, for an excellent surfer adventure. In the midsts of finding the ideal surfing spot, a mysterious fellow is seen throughout, leading to an area where only the best surfers may go!
The amazing computer affects, add to the realness of a tropical oceanfront. The wet suits, Pablo's Tiki necklace, and cool red car come across as authentic, as you can get. This is not always the case, with kids programing.
The synchronization of singing numbers, couldn't be better. I recently learned, the creators have  professional dancers, and choreographers come in to get it, just, right!",1210809600,,620,5.019417475728155
2527744,5,B000EQ5TTW,The Backyardigans are a huge hit in my home.  Both my daughters LOVE them and this DVD happens to be one of their favorites.  Especially the last episode.  They could watch it over and over and over.  A great buy.,1209686400,,213,4.25
2527765,5,B000EQ5TTW,"My son loves the Backyardigan's.  I was DVRing them, but he wanted to watch them on trips and in his bedroom.  So I bought the whole set (10 DVDs).  The characters speak clearly, using proper english.  I think that sets a good example.  The singing and dancing are high quality.  The songs themselves can be a little inane, but it is a childrens show after all.",1197849600,,361,4.393939393939394
2527766,4,B000EQ5TTW,The music in this is very easy to listen to and the kids absolutely love the backyardigans.  Am planning to buy some music cd's from this selection too.  Found the prices quite reasonable.,1195689600,,188,4.666666666666667

2527768,5,B000EQ5TTW,"This was the first Backyardigans DVD I ever purchased. Before buying and watching this, I had heard of the Backyardigans, and they had been recommended, but as we usually have the very basic of cable, we never ran across an episode on TV.

Upon the very first viewing of ""Surf's Up!"" we fell in love. Heck, even the opening credits and theme song are wonderful! The characters are all adorable, and I like most the fact that unlike many shows for ""children,"" this actually IS appropriate and pleasant.

I have watched it several times by myself, and felt no guilt in doing so. And my toddler loves every episode. The DVD itself is high-quality, and if it will work in my super-sensitive DVD player, it will work ANYWHERE!

The episodes and themes:
""Surf's Up!"" - Afro-beat
""Riding the Range"" - Hip-hop (and the last song is a reworked rendition of ""Buffalo Gals"")
""Race to the Tower of Power"" - Latin Salsa (the second song is to the tune of ""Three Blind Mice"")
""The Quest for the Flying Rock"" - Disco (The very first song is to the tune of ""Hail, Hail The Gang's All Here"") Also, you cannot watch the dancing in this episode and NOT love it!

Highly recommended, and perhaps the best DVD than we have seen so far.",1185494400,,1214,4.479638009049774
2527769,5,B000EQ5TTW,I got this DVD for my two year old son. He occassionally watches the cartoon on TV but Spongebob is his thing. I was hoping he would get interested in something different. He's watched it through a few times and seems happy with it and it's a welcome relief for me to watch/listen to anything else. I recommend The Backyardigans to anyone with very young children. The color catches their attention. There is also singing and the concepts of the stories are simple to understand. I just wish the DVD was longer. It has only four different episodes on it and runs for only an hour. It's still great for the kids though!,1182470400,,618,4.477876106194691
2527770,5,B000EQ5TTW,"This is one of the few Backyardigans DVDs where all four episodes are outstanding.  My daughter loves the different styles of music, and she can't stop smiling and moving whenever we play this DVD.  I would highly recommend it.",1181865600,,227,4.794871794871795
2527771,5,B000EQ5TTW,"The Backyardigans are fantastic! The use of imagination is something people forget to do and we need to be reminded that life is fun and to just relax a little! The songs are fun, the characters are loveable, and these are videos you can actually watch multiple times without getting sick of them!!

I have been watching them all with my children and my oldest is 4.  Even after 4 years I still have all the videos and will always buy more!",1179705600,,440,4.353658536585366

2527775,4,B000EQ5TTW,"Two and a half year old loves this movie. It keeps him occupied and out of trouble and he requests to watch it. Great tool to keep a kid out of trouble and out of your hair, that is until he demands to watch it at bedtime and throws a tantrum.

He jumps up on furniture and pretends that he's surfing like Pablo!  It also includes Race To The Tower Of Power, The Quest For The Flying Rock and Riding The Range.  It also includes two music videos that are Buffalo Girls and Shake Your Body.

He's just too young to understand this episode. So, I just skip it @ this moment. I particularly like this DVD for the music selection (Salsa, merengue, Bachata, etc.. Latin Music). I just smile when I see ""Uniqua & Pablo"" dancing Salsa with a lot of swing. I also enjoy to listen Autin singing his version of ""Juan Talamera"" as the Mystery Life Guard. I just glad my son has the opportunity to grow up with such of good musical & cultural material, like the Backyardigans' dvds.",1155686400,,631,4.543859649122807
