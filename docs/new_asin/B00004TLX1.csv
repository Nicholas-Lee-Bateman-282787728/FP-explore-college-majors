1351650,5,B00004TLX1,"I have just begun teaching Pilates Matwork classes at our wellness center in Iowa. The Mind-Body Matwork series are great for our students to use as a home practice in-between their weekly classes. The different levels  demonstrated on the videos help students progress to more advanced  exercises. The demonstrations are clear, easy to follow and the background  music and scenery is wonderful!",963878400,24,395,5.338709677419355
1351651,5,B00004TLX1,"I bought these videos over a month ago directly from Dian Nissen-Ramirez (Director) and I love them...more importantly, I use them.  They are three separate and progressively more challenging workouts, but are excellent for  all levels of fitness.  The workouts are each short enough to fit into a  busy day, but can be combined when time permits or when you want a bit of a  challenge.  The exercises are explained clearly, they flow well from one to  the next and the music is very relaxing.  Well worth the investment.",963878400,21,521,4.775280898876405
1351652,5,B00004TLX1,I have the distinct pleasure of being the first reviewer of this Mind-Body Matwork package.  Excellent instruction along with stress-reducing accompaniment.  Each of the three videos can be utilized by any age group  or fitness level--not necessarily true of other Pilates videos I personally  have used.  So pleased with the workouts that I have e-mailed the  instructor to be advised of any forthcoming videos.,962236800,39,412,5.359375
7922990,3,B00004TLX1,"This review refers only to the third tape of this series, ""Strengthen,"" which I found to be a blend of Pilates and yoga movements.  The best part of this tape is the way that the movements flow into one another, as the moves are presented in a series of sequences.  Each sequence consists of 5-6 exercises, and each exercise is repeated 5-10 times before moving to the next.
Alhtough I liked the flow of the workout, there were several things I didn't like about it.  First of all, because instructor Dian Nissen-Ramirez moves smoothly from one move to the next, there are few cues to let the viewer know what is coming next.  Similarly, Dian spends little time on instruction.  I also was surprised to discover that the workout uses a Dynaband, as this is not mentioned on the box; I was able to substitute a yoga strap, but this did not work as well.  Finally, I felt that the sequences themselves were repeated too many times, as I became bored after the first couple of repetitions.
This tape would probably work best for someone who wants a faster paced Pilates/yoga practice and who doesn't mind viewing the video several times before actually doing the workout.  However, those who prefer uncomplicated, slower routines should look elsewhere.",1069286400,,1249,4.75462962962963
7922991,5,B00004TLX1,"These tapes have been great for me.  I love the way that Dian has no endless and peppy chatter.  She is there to tell me what to do and how to do it.  The exercises stretch me, work me, and relax me all at the same time.  I notice an absolute difference in how I stand, sit, and breathe on days when I use the videos and on days when I don't.  Video number one is simple to do.  It goes slow and they focus on how to do the exercises correctly not on how many you can get done.  Another wonderful thing is that the videos are short-about 1/2 an hour.  As the mother of a 3 year old this is perfect for me, I can get up early, exercise and still have some extra time before my daughter wakes up.  Since starting these videos I am more mindful of my breathing, especially when stress arises.  I have lost 42 pounds as a combination of the videos and a change in eating habits.  The exercises are well explained.  Even though I was very, very heavy when I started I was able to do every single exercise in video one.  As I've progressed I am getting better every day at video two and am looking forward to video three someday.  Ms. Ramirez could not have made a better set of videos, I recommend them to everyone.  You can use them to get hyped up and get a good workout and yet somehow, when I am stressed in the evenings, if I do them then, I am calm and relaxed afterwards.  Excellent job Ms. Ramirez and I will continue to tell everyone about this great series.",1036022400,,1462,4.077192982456141
7922992,5,B00004TLX1,"This video is better than any mat class I have taken recently. There is a lack of qualified and experienced mat teachers right now and this set fills that need. I wasn't sure about the workout when I first viewed the tapes but I ""get it"" now. The moves on Mind Body Matwork are slow and controlled, not fast and sloppy like so many instructors are teaching right now. The more I work out to these videos, the more I appreciate them. These tapes successfully retain the principle of the original Pilates method and it's a good workout.",1012521600,5,534,4.459183673469388
7922993,5,B00004TLX1,"Not since Jane Fonda's revolutionary 1980 workout video was released have I benefitted as much as I have from Dian's video.  I like it because she does not ""jabber"".  The background music is quiet and relaxing.  It is a great way to work out all the stiffness upon wakening in the morning.  I highly recommend it for the person like me who is just trying to ""maintain"" overall flexibility and wants a complimentary workout to their other extracurricular activities, i.e., walking, biking, gardening, etc.",975196800,12,504,4.964285714285714
7922994,3,B00004TLX1,"I've been working with a personal trainer on the Pilates method and was ready to get out of the gym and do the exercises I'd learned at home.  This set was NOT for me - as nothing looked familiar to what I'd been doing!  Bottomline:  if you're trying to mimic what you're doing at the gym with a trainer or in a class, this is probably not your best buy.  However, if you are looking for simple floor exercises to do - and don't care if they're true Pilates or Yoga or anything else - you should enjoy, as the three tape set is very comprehensive.  Another warning:  You need some basic training in the fundamentals of mat work to exercise along with these videos. Dian doesn't say alot (which is a plus) but I couldn't figure out if I was doing the exercises correctly.",974160000,19,770,4.275862068965517
7922995,5,B00004TLX1,"Dian Nissen Ramirez' Mind-Body Matwork Video Series is an excellent contribution to the new efforts in holistic fitness and exercise. Using her deep scientific and experiential knowledge of the human body and exercise physiology as well as building upon and modifying the classical techniques and methods of Joseph Pilates, Dian takes the viewers through a series of breathing exercises and movements to improve posture, spinal alignment, flexibility, muscle tone, and overall well-being. The tapes include workouts for every fitness level. I recommend the video series for all of those seriously interested in a complete mind-body workout.",970012800,15,640,5.677083333333333
7922996,5,B00004TLX1,"I have other Pilates workout videos and I like that these are not just the same old stuff.  Also, Diane (the instructor) gets right down to business  with her cuing.  There is no excessive talking to hear over & over  again which makes it easier to concentrate on doing the moves right.  She  has a pleasant voice and awesome form! I am sure my form is not as good but  she makes a good example to follow and stay motivated with.  Plus, the  emphasis is on doing everything with precision and control.  Very user  friendly and still definitely Pilates!",967852800,22,552,4.474747474747475
7922997,5,B00004TLX1,"These tapes are getting me in shape!  I have heard Pilates is a great workout so I wanted to try it myself.  I found #1 to be a super intro for  beginners and I have loaned the tape to friends who want a taste of  Pilates.  I have to stay focused on the movements so I don't get sloppy.  When I do the movements as the instructor does, it is more challenging.  Pilates is an easy workout if you do the exercise incorrectly or with bad  form.  The Powermat (#3) is a challenge for me but I am getting there.  The  music is nice.  I like that there is no extra chatter, just instructions  that get to the point.  The more I use the tapes the more I appreciate  that.",966124800,38,664,4.0
7922998,3,B00004TLX1,"If you have been doing Pilates for a while and you want a challenging  workout, these tapes are not for you.  I have been doing another tape for 6  months now (The Method: Precision Toning), and these tapes presented no  challeging excercises.  I will use tape 3 on days that I need a light  relaxing workout without a lot of effort.  I don't think I will ever user  tape 1 or tape two.  They are way too easy.  The good thing about them is  that they are only 30 minutes long and the music is great.",965347200,33,500,4.104166666666667
