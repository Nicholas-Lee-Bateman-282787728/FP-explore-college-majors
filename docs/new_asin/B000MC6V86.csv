Do this every morning when you get up.  You can't give yourself 9 minutes?  The most important thing you will get, is the ability to breathe.  Something few of us do.  We think we do until we start climbing stairs.  These moves look and sound funny, but once you get hooked, you will know that you are improving your health internally. The best time to do this tape is first thing in the morning.  You must have an empty stomach.  You will notice your breathing improved throughout the day. I know of no other exercise tape that can do that!",1385596800,4,710,4.2706766917293235

You feel inches going. Don't think it's going to get rid of hundreds of pounds, but you definitely feel good. Eat right and exercise and use the tape...",1316390400,4,329,4.7894736842105265
