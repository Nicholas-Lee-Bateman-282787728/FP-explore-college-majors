8241502,1,B0011EIRTA,I here a hint of snide commentary directed at conservatives.  It may have been slightly amusing had they left the leftist politics out of it. What a bore.,1519430400,,154,4.5
8241503,4,B0011EIRTA,Started a little slow. But was real fun.,1472774400,,40,4.125
8241504,1,B0011EIRTA,Didn't find it that funny.,1470787200,,26,4.4
8241505,5,B0011EIRTA,"Oh it brings back the memories of ""Duck and Cover!"" Yes let's get under our desks so when the nuclear bomb hits we will be safe! I adore Zombie movies, and this short film had me laughing. Silly me saw it on YouTube, but had to buy it for myself, so when I am dead and buried (remember to cut off my head before burying me), my family can wonder about it, and think... what the heck?

I found it very entertaining and would recommend it to my friends...oh wait, I already did!!",1243987200,,477,4.129032258064516
8241506,5,B0011EIRTA,"All my friends were talking about this movie so I bought it and it's hilarious! It's cheesy but in a funny 1950's kinda way. It's very refreshing to see something original instead of another copy of someone elses idea. If you like Zombies and those funny PSA commercials, then you'll love this.",1238544000,,294,4.673076923076923
8241507,3,B0011EIRTA,This nice short (10-15 minutes) is entertaining if you like zombies. It shows a family doing all the wrong things,1207353600,,113,4.7
8241508,5,B0011EIRTA,God this movie is so great! I've watched it at least 6 or 9 times now and keep basking in all that is the greatest movie dedicated to zombification and what not to do as well as what to do. Greatest effing movie EVER. Buy it - NOW! Nooch.,1207094400,3,238,3.877551020408163
