8107200,4,B000E8N98I,"Marian Morgan (Mary Ainslee) waits until her mother goes out to her bridge game, so she can have ""the gang"" over for a bash of her own. These ""teens"" (none of whom could possibly be under 25) spend the night Jitterbugging, and playing strip poker! In typical fashion, a tap-dancing majorette shows up, complete w/ glittery uniform and twirling baton! Meanwhile, mum's been out w/ a gigolo known as ""the Count"". At evening's end, mum brings ""the Count"" home for a nightcap. Unfortunately for her, he falls for Marian instead. Thus begins Marian's downward spiral, into a world of mariachi bands, clown-faced matadors , dogs in bull costumes, and human trafficking! MAD YOUTH is a morality tale from 1940. While not as gloriously inane as, say, REEFER MADNESS, it does have its own silly charm. Plus, the dance routines are a kick!...",1433808000,,832,4.866197183098592
8107201,5,B000E8N98I,"Set in the glamorous world of 1939, this poorly made movie has a script that holds up quite well, right through to the end. Yes, there are some bad scenes and terrible acting, but amidst it all some absolutely fabulous dance numbers. The wonderful Jitterbug dancers have a great spirit that wasn't dulled by the ""pasteurization"" that Hollywood too often applied to mainstream movies.

Just when you think the movie might be going downhill, along comes some captivating Flamenco dancing and a ""bull fight"" with adorable jumping dogs dressed in bull costumes. I also loved the way Mary Ainslee (the actress who played Marian) looks directly into the camera whenever she talks on the phone; she kind of pops out at you, as does this movie in general. It's one of those things I watched on a fluke, but wound up enjoying much more than I had expected!

If nothing else, watch the Jitterbug scene starting at time = 9:30 and the Mexican cafe scene at time= 30:05.

EDIT: I keep coming back and watching the Jitterbug scene over and over again. In particular, the boy with the striped shirt and the girl in the solid colored dress he dances with. There's plenty of forced acting in the rest of the movie, but this scene rings true for me in an absolutely delightful way. Their genuine energy; just being themselves and having a wonderful time dancing; was truly captured in this movie in a way that doesn't happen very often. It's really a treasure!",1419897600,,1443,4.673228346456693

8107203,5,B000E8N98I,"my sister and I were watching this on different t.v.s and we couldn't stop laughing and loving this film. the dialogue is great, with some lines being delivered so deadpan, you don't know if they are doing it on purpose, and yes that is awesome. it is a great story and the dialogue has some film noir moments. don't know what to say, but if you stumble onto this review and love older movies, GET THIS.",1397692800,,403,4.315789473684211
8107204,2,B000E8N98I,"Released in 1939, this low-budget exploitation drama would have fared better without its obvious padding. ""Mad Youth"" screeches to a halt for endless nightclub performances from La Golondrina Cafe of Los Angeles. I kid you not. The above-average cast includes silent-film star Betty Compson and comic actor Monte Collins (who has enough screen time to belt out a melancholy song). More enjoyable and less amateurish than other ""adult"" potboilers. Veteran filmmaker Melville Shyer was a founder of the Directors Guild of America.",1395705600,,528,5.451219512195122
8107205,4,B000E8N98I,"Mad Youth is one of those ""exploitation films"" from the 1930s that doles out a hefty morality message that being anything less than 100% pure, pragmatic and down-to-Earth will bring you nothing but the worst kind of trouble. The plot moves along well and it is entertaining even though the acting isn't the best--there are some dance scenes that impress me despite this being an Alpha Video release. Alpha Video did little to restore this film which is unfortunate; but that's Alpha Video for you! The script is not that well written but the casting was well done. It's really just an average story; but with those great dance scenes and that plot which moves along nicely it actually becomes a four star film.

When the action starts, we meet middle-aged divorce Lucy Morgan (Betty Compson) and her daughter Marian (Mary Ainslee); and more often than not they certainly are at odds with one another. Lucy squanders her alimony money on ""escort men"" to the point where she has to ask her own daughter Marian for a midweek loan! Lucy eventually meets her latest escort, Count DeHoven (Willie Castello), and she falls for him completely. Lucy wants the Count to marry her; but after the Count meets Marian he wants little to do with the pushy Lucy as he prefers to spend more time with Marian behind Lucy's back. In addition, Lucy has no knowledge of Marian's wild parties (although for the most part they would look fairly tame by today's standards) which Marian and her friends enjoy when Lucy is out playing bridge--and more--with her ""escorts.""

Things heat up as Count DeHoven and Marian date more and more often behind Lucy's back; and when Lucy steals and reads Marian's diary things explode at once. Marian decides to visit her friend Helen (Betty Atkinson) who, she thinks, has run away to marry the man that she loves. Unfortunately, Marian soon discovers that Helen isn't exactly living with her new husband; Lucy has to face a big surprise as well.

Look also for Lorelei Readoux to play the role of Beth, one of Marian's friends; and Margaret Fealy has a good cameo as Helen's grandmother.

It may well seem as if I've given away much too much of the story; but I assure you that I haven't. The last fifteen minutes or so of the film offer up some interesting, unexpected plot twists and turns that should keep you entertained.

Mad Youth is a film I recommend for people who enjoy ""exploitation films"" and dramas, especially dramas with complicated mother-daughter relationships. I must say it's not the best film I've seen to date but with the dancing and the plot twists near the end it's not all that bad either.",1272844800,3,2627,4.714596949891067
