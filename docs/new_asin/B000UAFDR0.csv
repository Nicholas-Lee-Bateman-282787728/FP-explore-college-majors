2917765,3,B000UAFDR0,About 8 years ago one lonely Saturday night I was bed ridden with the flu. As I was surfing the cable channels that night I surfed right into the Turner network channel. There they were airing four sci-fi fun gems. Two of those were  The Creature With The Atom Brain and  The Werewolf. I was in 1950 Sci-fi heaven. Finally they are on DVD. If you are looking for some big serious production out of these films then you'll need to pass. However if you are looking for good cheap fun then grab some popcorn and turn off the lights.,1191801600,14,529,4.28

1. The Giant Claw= The last word on monster fx's. You can see the strings and the ""bird"" looks laughable, but the movie is still great fun if you let it be.
2. The Werewolf= An ""atomic"" twist on the old werewolf legend and really pretty good
3. Zombies Of Mora Tua= Silly and very funny.
4. The Creature With The Atom Brain= Brain dead fun

2917822,5,B000UAFDR0,"LOVE this quartet of black and white 50's sci-fi / horror flicks.
THE GIANT CLAW
This film sports one of the silliest movie monster ever.  A giant bird with a long scrawny neck, pop eyes, and a long plume on its head flies all over, wrecking planes, scarfing down parachuting flyers, and generally making a giant nuisance if itself.  A pilot and a female scientist try to figure out how to bring this bird down while carrying on a battle-of-the-sexes bicker-fest.
CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN
A mobster enlists an ex-Nazi scientist to revive his dead gunsels as mindless zombies to battle the forces of good.
ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU
A young woman returns to the family homestead in Africa and finds her grandmother trying to keep Voodoo revived zombies at bay.  It seems the 'zombs' guard a treasure that a recently arrived expedition is hot to obtain.
THE WEREWOLF
This one is the best of the bunch.  A confused man arrives at an isolated mid-to-north California mountain town after an unscrupulous scientist has irradiated him.  The man can't remember what happened to him but whenever he undergoes a trauma or fears for his life he transforms into a werewolf.  Steven Ritch as the tampered with man gives a very effective performance.  You really feel for the guy.  Also the locations are great.  If it isn't an actual small village it certainly looks like one.  It's a very small place where everyone knows everyone else, the main industry is housing and supplying visiting hunters, and if it has TV or radio reception I'd be surprised.
The quality of all films is excellent and has trailers and other extras.  Highly, highly recommended.",1468022400,,1638,4.7935943060498225

2917859,5,B000UAFDR0,"The ""Sam Katzman: Icons of Horror Collection"" is a two DVD, four movie set from one of the great B-movie producers of the 1950's. When I think of Katzman, I think first and foremost of ""The Giant Claw"", one of my favorite ""so bad it's good"" movies of all time. Directed by Fred F. Sears, the film is a turkey of epic proportions both literally and figuratively. Don't just buy this set for ""The Giant Claw"", though, as the other films are interesting in their own right. Sears also directed ""The Werewolf"", a much better movie that follows the classic monster movie arc with an atomic age twist that I won't reveal. The DVDs come with several extras including short features (Including a Mr. Magoo cartoon!) and several trailers of interest.

""The Giant Claw"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. Let me qualify that statement. It is a terrible sci-fi giant creature thriller from 1957 about a turkey vulture from outer space that is terrorizing the Earth. The special effects on this film will make your jaw drop no matter how many comically terrible movies you've seen. The film works as great entertainment in a ""so bad it's good"" way because of the absolute sincerity of the performers and the stern and ponderous tone of the script. Much of the dialogue is beyond hilarious, and the science mumbo-jumbo and flying lingo in particular are astonishing. I love the concept of an ""antimatter screen"", the reason for the bird's imperviousness to radar, the entire concept of ""atomic spitballs"", and occasional bouts of almost completely nonsensical dialogue delivered in a deadly serious manner. My favorite line is from star Jeff Morrow, who contemplates being the only pilot to survive an encounter with the creature thusly: ""That makes me chief cook and bottle washer in a one-man birdwatcher's society."" What? This is a must-see film for anyone who loves B-movies: truly a classic of special effects underachievement, I guarantee that if you watch ""The Giant Claw"" you will never forget the beak from outer space!

""Creature With The Atom Brain"" is a largely overlooked sci-fi classic from 1955 starring Richard Denning, who is perhaps best remembered for ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"". The film plays like a film noir thriller initially as a mobster is killed in his office. The complications start when the police discover the murderer has been dead for almost a month. The film then veers off firmly into science fiction territory as the police discover that not only is there radiation at every crime scene, there are multiple recently deceased bodies missing from the morgue. Could there be a criminal revenge thuggery angle involving zombies, mobsters, and an evil German scientist? Of course there could: this is a Sam Katzman film, after all!

The movie is briskly paced and is interesting if not entirely convincing (nobody is bothered by gigantic forehead incisions?) The acting ranges from quite decent to tolerable, and while the characters are really more caricature than anything, it's a fun throwback to the golden days of sci-fi, when techno-talk was hilarious, the science was absurd, and the plots were predictable.

""Zombies of Mora Tau"" is an old school zombie movie with little blood and a bit of cartoonish violence, but great film noir atmosphere. The film is set in Africa and revolves around the crew of the doomed ship the ""Susan B"" (and its cargo of diamonds) which sank off the coast, and its crew who were destined to be reanimated as the undead. Much background and exposition are provided by Grandmother Peters (Marjorie Eaton) whose husband was the Captain of the ""Susan B"". Anyway, very little of this matters, as you came to see zombies, and zombies you shall have. Various parties try to get their hands on the diamonds including Jeff Clark (Gregg Palmer) and George Harrison (No not that George Harrison!) and after double-crosses and drama the zombies are finally destroyed and allowed to get some eternal rest in the great final scene of the film where Eaton turns in a gem of a performance at the climax.

The film features lots of shrill female screaming, abduction, peril, and zombification, tons of wandering around jungle foliage in the middle of the night looking for seaweed and footprints, a sizeable cast of lumbering zombies, and, of course, a love story. This film is from 1957 and was very cheaply made, but actually does well generating creepy atmosphere. The cult movie lover in me loves the hilariously bogus ""underwater"" scenes, and if you like 1950s science fiction or B-movies in general, you will delight in the diving spectacle served up here, but more serious-minded viewers may find these long segments highly distracting. The film is only 70 minutes long, but it feels much longer. Much of the action is repetitive, all of it is predictable, and there are stretches that flirt with boringness. I really do like ""Zombies of Mora Tau"", but just wish it had been ten minutes shorter, though of course being that short would have meant an instant commercial death in the feature marketplace.

Finally, there is ""The Werewolf"", which is a monstrous atomic age parable about a man involved in an automobile accident becoming the unwitting pawn in a scientific game. Caught between two scientists and the law, the fundamentally upright protagonist played perfectly by Steven Ritch is a very sympathetic character, and despite the less than amazing time-lapse man-to-werewolf transmogrification scenes, the atmosphere evoked by Sears is eminently suited to the story and very nicely handled. I had seen all of these movies except ""The Werewolf"" before, and while ""The Giant Claw is my personal favorite from a cult movie entertainment standpoint, ""The Werewolf"" is the most nuanced and genuinely effective of the four.

Sam Katzman had an amazing career: this box set provides a glimpse of his body of work. Some of these movies have never been available on DVD before (""The Werewolf"" was notoriously difficult to track down), and for the price this is a great set that is entertaining, nostalgic, and truly enjoyable. Give Sam Katzman a try: you'll be glad you did!",1449878400,2,6130,4.957198443579767

2917867,4,B000UAFDR0,"To be honest I got this just for the 'Werewolf'. It has a little history with me also if you care to hear my story.
  I was on vacation in Florida in July 1956 when I was all of 12 years old with my father and sister ( my mother passed away w hen I was 10 years old.)  We were staying on the Atlantic coast, I believe in Miami beach and the Werewolf was being shown at a local theatre. I pleaded with my father to see it with him. So we went and I damned near wet my pants from fright. It was the scariest picture up to that time I had ever seen. When he changed I had my fingers half covering my eyes, so never really got a good view of the werewolf. But it sure scared the hell out of me!
 So, even now at my age it gives chills. It is simply one of the best werewolf films ever made. And I have seen them all. It is a classic and I give it 5 huge stars.
 To me the rest of the films in the collection are outright silly and 2 star quality. Sorry, that's how I see it. But get it for the WEREWOLF. Still very scary!",1425686400,7,1017,3.7116279069767444

2917895,5,B000UAFDR0,"You get four ""B"" movie classics on this CD.  I can't speak to its technical merits, except to say that the movies look as good to me as any other films on TV.  For me, CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN (1955) and THE WEREWOLF (1956) are the best films in the set, with excellent performances - Richard Denning's presence gives a firm grounding to the story about radioactively-animated corpses and Steven Ritch as the werewolf will break your heart.  Jeff Morrow and Don Megowan are always welcome additions to any film as well.  However, even Mr. Morrow's earnest acting can't overcome the ludicrous puppet menace of THE GIANT CLAW (1957), but it's charming in its goofy Saturday-matinee way.  THE ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU (1957) is the weakest of the bunch; although it features some eye candy provided by Allison Hayes, the zombies are nothing to write home about.  None of these movies are great films - they're bad enough to be good, not bombs.",1412294400,,939,4.695121951219512

2917926,5,B000UAFDR0,"An often overlooked gem from the 1950s. While considered by some film critics to be basically a low budget venture, this film nonetheless delivers on every level horror fans have come to expect. It is a clever, well written, well photographed and extremely well acted thriller presented with the one essential ingredient necessary for any well done werewolf piece: tragedy. Steven Ritch portrays Duncan Marsh, a family man injected by an unscrupulous doctor experimenting with a serum derived from wolves resulting in horrific consequences for Marsh, his family, and anyone unfortunate enough to cross paths with him. The film succeeds because all of the central characters are well written, engaging, and well acted by a fine cast as the story unfolds taking its time in presenting it's truly frightening werewolf.  Moreover,this film is an interesting combination of a traditional supernatural subject with a science fiction angle popular in 50s films. The film possesses a tragic feel to it while not sacrificing any of the truly frightening moments of lycanthrope horror. An extremely entertaining entry into the werewolf genre. Its well worth a look.  5 stars.",1395964800,4,1165,5.291891891891892
2917927,5,B000UAFDR0,"This is the first 'werewolf' movie made, I believe. The premise is a little different than the later werewolf movies about getting bitten and thereby infected. This centers on a kind and gentle family man who is surreptitiously injected with a serum. There's no blood or gore as in today's more graphic movies, but the acting is excellent, the script well written, and the photography above the norm for a movie of this age. I can recommend this movie for family viewing. Only very young children would be disturbed by it.",1395705600,,522,4.747252747252747

ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU has a good cast of B-movie regulars but a rather average plot.  Which brings us to THE GIANT CLAW, which is really not a bad film if you can get past the rather stupid-looking flying monster.  The actors try hard but the Japanese did the flying creature much better in RODAN!  Perfect film to watch on Thanksgiving to go along with eating your turkey dinner.  DVD has the trailers to all the films plus a few extra ones.

2917953,4,B000UAFDR0,"The title for this set might lead you astray - yes, they are ""horror"" movies, but only mildly so.  There is no blood and gore, no reeking viscera, and no severed body parts.  For example:

In ""Creature with the Atom Brain"", when a remote-controlled, atom-powered dead man lifts his victim over his head to break the man's back - you see only the shadow of the event on the wall. . . .

In ""The Giant Claw"", when the toothy, battleship-sized buzzard swoops down and snaps its maw closed on a helpless pilot suspended beneath his parachute - the action is so far away you can't see the gory details. . . .

In ""Zombies of Mora Tau"", when a zombie breaks the neck of crewman Johnson - you only see the zombie pull Johnson into the dark waters, with his demise out-of-sight under water. . . .

In ""The Werewolf"", when a man is threatened by a mugger, he changes into a werewolf, savagely lacerating the mugger's neck - this deadly event takes place out-of-sight in an alley. . . .

Note:  The film with the most jumble of scientific jargon is ""Creature with the Atom Brain"".  The film wrongly references Faraday's famous frog experiment - it was actually Luigi Galvani's experiment: he found that a dead frog's leg muscle would twitch when sparked.

Extras:
""Mysterious Island, Episode 2 'Sinister Savages' "" (1951) - 16 minutes.  (A confusing chapter.)
""Midnight Blunders"" (1936) - 17 minutes.  Two bungling policemen search Chinatown for the peg-legged Dr. Wong - he had kidnapped a scientist to learn the secret of his lab-made monster. . . .  (Funny!  Worth a look.)
""Terror Faces Magoo"" (1958) - (color) - 7 minutes.  Mr. Magoo is a severely near-sighted cartoon character.  (A yawner.)

2917968,5,B000UAFDR0,"This is an excellent set of 50's Sci-Fi and Horror B-movies.  ""Creature With The Atom Brain"" is fullscreen, the rest are in anamorphic widescreen, and all four movies look great!  They are practically flawless prints with great sound.  But how are the movies?  Here's my breakdown:

THE GIANT CLAW:  One of the all time anti-classics in B-movie history, ""The Giant Claw"" tells the story of humanity fighting against a giant anti-matter space buzzard, which is one of the most gloriously goofy movie monsters ever made.  Its a giant marionette that looks like something Jim Henson woulda thought up were he on bad acid at the time.  The strings are always visible and the wings hardly ever move when flying.  Seeing this ridiculous puppet flop around a table trying to eat a toy train is the kind of thing that can convert a normal person into a crazed B-movie schlock lover.  A tremendously entertaining film, easily worth the price of the whole set.

CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN:  Short movie (all of 69 minutes) that makes suprisingly good use of its non-existant budget.  A gangster finances a scientist's experiments to turn dead bodies into radio controlled zombies, then uses said zombies to seek revenge on those who crossed him.  The movie mixes those scenes with a police procedural as the authorities try to figure out whats going on.  You get an interesting, fast moving story with above average writing for a 50's cheapie, some fun hard-boiled detective dialogue, some really effective scare scenes (my wife got really creeped out when the zombie broke a guys back in the opening scene), and a news reporter named Dick Cutting!  Seriously, Dick Cutting!  I kept waiting for an emergency broadcast to happen then for a voice to say ""We now return you to Dick Cutting.""  I liked this movie more than I thought I would, it was really fun.

ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU:  A group of treasure hunters seeking some diamonds lost in a shipwreck encounter the zombified crew of the wreck guarding them!  A fairly original idea, but they could've used a little makeup on the zombies, its kinda weird to see two women screaming with terror at what, by all appearances, is just a guy who's a little damp.  This movie starts great, but doesn't really know how to end and just kinda peters out.  Still, its fun enough, and the underwater scenes are kinda interesting considering that none of them were actually filmed underwater.

THE WEREWOLF:  Interesting Werewolf tale, as the monster in question here was the victim of a science experiment gone wrong, not of a gypsy's curse.  Great location shooting, good moodiness, the werewolf in question is very troubled and overacts his pathos quite well, but like ""Zombies..."" it also kinda peters out instead of ending dynamically.  Still, the first two acts are great, and make for a fun movie.

Tons of fun for the B-movie fan, these films are all more entertaining than they could've been.  The extras are great too, as one disc contains a comedy short and a Mr. Magoo cartoon, and the other has a part of a serial, so if you watch the shorts first, then the two movies on either disc, you've just re-created what they'd do for drive-in double features!",1363564800,10,3193,4.775547445255475

2917974,5,B000UAFDR0,"The Amazon review for this one pretty much tells you everything you need to know, and I'm in full agreement. ""The Giant Claw"" and ""Zombies Of Mora Tau"" balance numbskull MST3K-style fun with moments of extreme boredom, but they're worth viewing. In all honesty, I wouldn't have purchased them as stand-alone movies, but as part of this set, it's no harm, no foul.

Still, the price is right, and so is Amazon...these two films are rich in the heritage of Universal's classic black & white monster films, and they bring in the added element of 50s paranoia. Both are incredibly atmospheric, the kind of films you can lose yourself in during a Saturday afternoon / evening ""Creature Features"" wave of nostalgia. TRUE fans of horror / sci-fi movies love the full spectrum, from the inept and lovable trash of Ed Wood's films to the mind-numbing creativity and spectacular cinematography of the Universal classics. These movies fall somewhere in between.

I'd say that ""The Giant Claw"" and ""Zombies Of Mora Tau"" fall somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars, while ""Creature With The Atom Brain"" and ""The Werewolf"" are 5 stars all the way. If you have even the slightest interest in the films or genres I've named in this review, this collection belongs in your movie library.",1329177600,2,1661,5.509803921568627

2917976,3,B000UAFDR0,"Sam Katzman (1901-1973) began his film career on Hollywood's ""poverty row,"" working as an independent producer selling low budget genre films to Monogram Studios.  He was prolific and he stayed within budget, so it wasn't long before he was at Columbia, where he continued in the same vein but with slightly better budgets and somewhat longer shooting schedules.  In the 1960s he would move to MGM, where found himself grinding out films for the likes of Elvis Presley, but although he had a long career, and although his movies typically did well at the box office, he was essentially a ""B"" movie producer--and when he did have the chance to work with large budgets and big stars at MGM he found he didn't like it.

Most of the movies Katzman produced were forgotten almost as soon as the audience left the theatre, but four of his horror movies have developed a cult following of sorts: THE GIANT CLAW, CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN, ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU, and THE WEREWOLF.  All were filmed in the mid-to-late 1950s, with THE GIANT CLAW infamous for its terrible special effects.  Directed by Fred F. Sears--one of Katzman's favorite directors; he also directed ROCK AROUND THE CLOCK and THE WEREWOLF--the film has a good pace and a reasonable cast, but it also has one of the most ridiculous monsters ever to hit the screen: a bird from outer space that looks something like Phyllis Diller without a wig.  According to leading man Jeff Morrow, audiences laughed so much at the premier that he quietly slipped out a side door before he could be recognized.

If THE GIANT CLAW might be regarded as a ""C"" or ""D"" or even ""F"" movie, the other three films in this four pack are solid ""B.""  CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN is directed by Edward L. Cahn, creator of IT! THE TERROR FROM FROM BEYOND SPACE.  With Richard Denning heading the cast, it offers a tale of a killer bent on revenge who teams with a semi-mad scientist to turn normal men into killing zombies.  Although it is probably best recalled for its blatant 1950s sexism, it plays out at a nice pace.  Much the same is also true of THE ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU, also directed by Cahn and featuring Allison Hayes, best known for the cult classic ATTACK OF THE FIFTY FOOT WOMAN.  On this occasion, zombies protect diamonds in Africa--and although the movie doesn't show a single black person in the entire continent, it clips along nicely.

And then there is THE WEREWOLF, directed by Fred F. Sears, and which is almost as awful as Sear's THE GIANT CLAW.  In this little ditty, the wolfman is the product of scientific experiment by two evil doctors, whose radioactive injections have turned an innocent bystander into a wolfman killer on the prowl.  The transformation scenes are unsuccessful, to be generous about it; the story and script are tedious; and the cast, particularly werewolf Steven Ritch, is notable for lack of interest.  The whole thing is singularly ho-hum.

Now, some people like 1950s ""B"" movies and some do not.  If you are among those who do, you'll likely enjoy this four pack.  The prints are extremely good, almost pristine, and the sound is very good as well.  Recommended for fans of the genre, just be away that only fans of the genre are likely to any of them.

2918017,4,B000UAFDR0,"When I first saw this film at the tender, prepubescent age of 10, I was petrified beyond belief. Now, I suppose, the kindest thing I can say about THE WEREWOLF -- which still retains a chilling degree of atmosphere -- is that it's certainly nowhere near as bad as WEREWOLF IN A GIRLS' DORMITORY (despite the superior transformation scene of the latter).

Steven Ritch (as pitiful Duncan Marsh) brings an even greater depth of sympathy to the role than his better well-known predecessor, Lon Chaney, Jr., but Ritch's make-up, along with his unconvincing transformation from man into beast, recalls (much to the film's detriment) the almost ""cutesy"" looking Andreas from RETURN OF THE VAMPIRE. (One would have hoped that ""werewolf technology"" would have made far more significant strides between 1943 and 1956.) Nonetheless, I award this film a solid 4 stars, based on Ritch's memorable performance and, again, because of the film's striking atmosphere.",1319155200,2,951,5.175324675324675

2918020,4,B000UAFDR0,"The Werewolf, 1956 film

Legends of werewolves goes back to the ancient Greeks and Romans. The movie begins in a bar. A stranger is passing through town. After he leaves a man tries to rob him; a bad career move. ""Only an animal can do that."" Get your guns! ""Those are wolf tracks."" Colby was hurt pretty bad. Will he get the Pasteur treatment for rabies? A murder report must be submitted. That stranger awakes in the morning and puts on his socks and shoes. The people in town are banned from hunting in the woods. Can a lightly dressed man survive in the woods in winter? The roads are blocked. Reporters are inquisitive. Duncan Marsh shows up at Doctor Gilchrist's house with a memory loss. What happened to him? He runs away. The sheriff will search the woods with the townsmen. Can they take him alive? We see Dr. Morgan Chamber's laboratory where he has dogs in a cages. Can people be immunized against radiation? [This provides a skimpy background to this strange story.] Mrs. Helen Marsh with her son Chris arrive in an Oldsmobile to search for her husband.

The search for the werewolf goes on. Drs. Morgan Chambers and Emery Forrest search for Marsh in the hills. Stress affects Marsh, he turns into a monster and attacks Forrest. Later an attack on a sheep creates a new alarm in the country. Can a bear trap catch the werewolf? They find Duncan Marsh's abandoned car. The werewolf takes the bait and is caught in the bear trap, but he escapes. Chambers and Forrest discuss a cover-up for what they did. ""Newspapers are always looking for a sensation."" The Sheriff and the townsmen search for Marsh with a new device, a portable voice amplifier. [The right to keep and bear arms was unquestioned.] The wolfman is captured alive and put into a jail cell. What caused this to happen? Its quiet in the night. Chambers and Forrest are up to no good again. [Does Chambers' domination of Forrest have a hidden clue?] Their plans go awry! [Poetic justice?] Marsh escapes, the townsmen search in the woods. Torches are thrown at the monster. The chase goes on. The men shoot at him. In the end Marsh changes back to a human form.

This low-budget movie used little-known actors (who look like real people). Its story echoes earlier horror movies. Yet is has value as a morality play for that era. It is worth watching. Some say ""horror movies"" become popular in a depression or recession, and some parts of a country are more affected. The story of ""scientists"" who experiment on people without informed consent was all too true. [Read the book ""Journey Into Madness"".] The legends of werewolves in olden times often originated after an outbreak of rabies. Wolves and other wild animals are often carriers of rabies. Anyone bit by a rabid wolf would, as the disease progressed, become violent and attack other people. There was no cure or prevention before Louis Pasteur's discovery of a vaccine. Some compared the legends of werewolves to the economic cycle where a number of good years would be followed by a number of bad years, seemingly beyond human control, like the weather.

Creature with the Atom Brain, 1954 film

A man drives a Ford to a house. He delivers a satchel with $20,000 to Hennessey, a good take. Then a man crashes into the window to kill him! Others break in and shoot at him, but he keeps on going. ""Drive home."" The first one is eliminated, there are others. The two men dress in protective gear to enter a laboratory. ""Different parts of the bodies die at different times. The brain is the first to go."" The police arrive to investigate. ""The killer had enormous strength."" His fingerprints are luminous! The scientists said the blood had crystalline substances but no hemoglobin. It is highly radioactive too! This creature can't be killed with bullets. ""I don't believe it."" The fingerprints identify the perpetrator: he died weeks ago in prison! Next DA McGraw is killed in his garage. What is the connection? How could the dead come back to life? Michael Faraday showed how dead frog legs could move. Nowadays it could be radioactive forces.

""Why did it happen in my administration?"" asks one official. The newspaper reports two dead men walk the streets. Daughter Penny can't read the comics or watch TV. Uncle Dave found out when McGraw and Hennessy worked together to convict Buchanan. The Captain warns the others that Buchanan may be back and they must be on guard. Buchanan has disappeared along with his German doctor Steig. [Note the old TV set.] A truck with a detector on its roof passes by, a man leaves by the back door. Wilhelm Steig did research on the amygdala of the brain. A truck with a detector passes by, a man leaves by the back door. Wilhelm Steig did research on the amygdala. Could this be applied to humans? Buchanan directs Steig to his next task. The Police Chief is asked to stop the search, or else.

There are many accidents in trains, planes, and vehicles on the roads and highways! The Governor declares a state of emergency. ""Carry your papers when you travel"" is the advice for the people. Captain Harris becomes a victim and test subject! Penny opens the door for Uncle Dave (his hand is cold). Capt. Davis visits the two men kept hidden in jail. There is an APB on Harris when the bodies are found. Harris is taken to a hospital for an examination. [You can guess how this story will end.]

This is an interesting story that combines a murder mystery (the search for a killer) with a horror story of a new man-made monster (like Dr. Victor Frankenstein's creation) and the novel feature of atomic radiation. This story uses atomic radiation as a power source.

2918022,4,B000UAFDR0,"I purchased this collection maybe a year ago, but I recently revisited all 4 movies and I am even more impressed this time around! You figure sometimes with B grade movies that they will be fun to watch once with friends and laugh at, but they don't offer a lot of replay value. Well, that's what I figured, but I was wrong. For me 'The Giant Claw' is now my favorite to watch because of the ridiculousness of the creature and the terrible miniatures. The first time I saw this flick I was with a friend and wasn't really paying attention, but it is a riot! I consider the other films to be a bit more serious and horror-like. 'Creatures With The Atom Brain' and 'Zombies Of Mora Tau' are both from the zombie genre, but 'Creatures' adds a lot of other horror / sci-fi clichs. 'Mora Tau' is a slower film, but worth watching for the occasionally water logged living dead. 'The Werewolf' could stand toe to toe with most werewolf movies that came before and after it. This time the creature is a product of science instead of the supernatural. My friend who is a werewolf movie fanatic loved this 50s gem and so did I. Every movie here is worth watching any number of times and you will discover something special with each viewing. Sam Katzman was a genius of the B-movie scene and the pictures presented on this box set have never looked better!

2918048,4,B000UAFDR0,"There's no getting around it:  the 1950s were not a great era for horror and science fiction films.  Yes, there are a few excellent movies, but for the most part, the genre was relegated to B-movie status, and even there, it was rarely treated with much respect.  Despite a lack of true quality, however, many of these movies can be fun to watch, even in a so-bad-it's-good sort of way.  The Sam Katzman - Icons of Horror Collection provides four such movies.

Katzman was a B-movie producer and few of his films are really well-known.  In an era when the studios produced a lot more movies, many were quite forgettable, and Katzman's movies fit into that category.  Only a truly dedicated film fan would be able to recall the movies in this set.

Creature with the Atom Brain is one of the horror films with a little bit of everything:  zombies, gangsters, radioactivity and Nazi scientists.  Written by Curt Siodmak (who created the modern werewolf with The Wolf Man), Creature deals with a gangster out for revenge against those who forced him into exile.  With the aid of the scientist, he is able to create zombie slaves of incredible strength.  Richard Denning (from The Creature From the Black Lagoon) is the earnest cop/scientist who, pipe always in hand, is out to stop the threat.  Although this movie has a little too much talk and not enough action, it does feature one of the most brutal murders of the Production Code era (and at the beginning of the movie, too).

You can literally see the strings in The Giant Claw, a giant monster movie with a enormous alien bird terrorizing the world.  The science in this movie is around as flimsy as the effects, with the monster's invulnerability due to an antimatter shield and the eventual solution involving mesons (I won't spoil the ending in explaining how; actually I can't, since it is as ludicrous as everything else in this film.

Zombies of Moro Tau is the one truly supernatural movie, with the undead protecting a stash of diamonds that are at the bottom of a river in a remote jungle.  Treasure hunters go after the gems, but nothing will stop these cursed creatures.  In the pre-Night of the Living Dead era, this slow-moving film is around par for the course for zombie films (although there have been good ones such as White Zombie and I Walked with a Zombie).

The rather unimaginatively titled The Werewolf deals with a werewolf.  In this case, the hapless soul who's turned into a monster is a nice family man who was transformed by mad scientists.  He wreaks havoc in a small mountain town while the scientists pursue him; there's little in this film that hasn't appeared in dozens of other werewolf movies.

Whether you enjoy these movies or not depends a lot on your mood.  If you like watching B-horror-movies, then these will fit the bill quite nicely; on the other hand, if you're looking for something scary, you'd want to look elsewhere.  While I more-or-less had fun watching this set, I'd hardly call it essential viewing, even for fans of this type of film.",1241827200,,3042,4.685499058380414

2918050,5,B000UAFDR0,"The Werewolf is one of the best horror movies ever made. It was made by Columbia so it's not a cheap B movie. The writing is done as

a small town who doesn't believe in the 'werewolf' story but just that someone was murdered and on the run in the woods. The makeup
is very good without being silly and taking away from the movie. A must have for any classic horror fan. The other 3 movies in this 4
disc collection is The Giant Claw which is probably 'the best worst movie ever made' as if Ed Wood made it! It's so bad it's good. The
Giant Bird Creature is hilarious and looks like a puppet with strings but again it's so good. The Zombies of Mora Tau is actually a good
kinda horror mystery zombie movie which I usually don't like zombie movies. Has good plot and acting and done very well. The worst

2918051,5,B000UAFDR0,"I absolutely love this set.  Though I must admit the name Sam Katzman was largely unfamiliar to me, I had previously purchased Sony's ""Icons of Horror--Boris Karloff"" collection, and was thrilled with that.  This set did not disappoint, as I had indeed seen all of these films many times on TV in my youth, and watching them again now has been like welcoming old friends into my home.

The most amazing thing about this set is the quality of the film transfers to DVD--pristine and magnificent, these movies have never looked so good!  As an example, I was watching ""The Werewolf"" last night and just could not BELIEVE the picture quality--I was floored, it literally looks brand new!  The prints of these movies shown on TV in the past have been downright murky--""Zombies of Mora Tau,"" in particular, always looked so foggy/hazy/grainy it was actually difficult to tell what was going on!  No longer--these prints are clear as a bell--and it's like seeing them with a new set of eyes!

Sony, PLEASE keep up the good work, these ""Icons of Horror"" (and now ""Icons of Adventure"" -- equally awesome!) collections are really among the industry standards relating to transfer quality of older low-budget films which normally would have been overlooked--very impressive.  I see that the next ""Icons of Horror"" will be released in October (2008), and will include Hammer films such as one of my all-time favorites, ""The Gorgon.""  A wonderful way to celebrate Halloween this year!",1214697600,12,1472,4.9271255060728745
2918052,4,B000UAFDR0,"Had never heard of Sam Katzman before Amazon recommended this 4 movie DVD set. Glad they did. These are 4 great B-Movies. The Giant Claw is similar to other B movies such as some of the Japanese cheese like Gamera etc. Creature With The Atomic Brain is similar to the 1960 sci-fi movies like Not Of This Earth,Brain From Planet Arous anyhow you get the idea. Zombies Of Mora Tau about modern day Diamond Hunters in the South Pacific trying to recover diamonds from a long ago ship wreck garded by Zombies both on land and sea to keep treasure hunters from cashing in on the diamond loot. I really liked this movie. Finally The Werewolf was a nice change from the usually Lon Chaney/JR format. Set in more modern time near Big Bear Lake in California. Over all a very good collection on 2 dvds. Highly recommended.",1209168000,6,813,4.5

2918054,5,B000UAFDR0,"This is a unique collection of Sam Katzman's mid and late 50's horror films: ""The Giant Claw"", ""The Zombies of Mora Tau"", ""Creature with the Atom Brain"" and ""The Werewolf"". Katzman was one of Columbia Pictures and Hollywood's greatest magicians,he was able to turn low budget ""B"" films into horror films favorites, he defintely accomplished it. These four memorable films in spite of their primitive special effects remain to this day unforgettable and definitely inspired subsequent films.
We might yet see new, sophisticated, state of the art remakes of all them sometime in the future and a lot of us, their loyal fans would look forward to their release.",1204329600,,658,5.045871559633028
2918055,5,B000UAFDR0,"This is a great set of 4 movies for people who like these 50's horror movies. The Werewolf is the best of the lot,(finally a great copy of this 1956 classic).The Giant Claw,Creature with the Atom Brain and Zombies of Mora Tau are campy but still great fun to watch. The picture quality is great too with some nice bonus features. If you like the 50's horror movies I think you'll enjoy this set. Go for it!!!!! It's great fun!!!!!!",1198713600,5,431,4.4
2918056,5,B000UAFDR0,"Wow!  This is a GREAT DVD!  I've been a Sam Katzman fan since way back! The Giant Claw is classic everyone should own.  When I was a little kid, these movies scared me to death.  And my older brother didn't make it any better by scaring me even more.  My brother recently came for a visit and he was surprised that I had this collection of horror movies.  Sure they're funny to us now but as a kid . . . they were really scary.  He did admit that the Zombies of Mora Tau scared him as a kid!  Anyway it was fun to watch our old favorites together once again . . . as adults!  If you love the classic horror flicks, this is one to own!",1196035200,10,634,3.890625
2918264,5,B000UAFDR0,"I am thrilled to have all these films on DVD at last, but the main reason I bought it was for THE WEREWOLF.  Opinions on the other films may differ (I personally think ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU is vastly underrated and is a great early entry in the zombie genre--it may seem silly now but it sure didn't then!), but few would deny that THE WEREWOLF is a terrific film.  I saw it when it first came out, double-billed with EARTH VS. THE FLYING SAUCERS.  I was 10 at the time, and had already seen all sorts of horror films, but none of them scared me.  My parents weren't sure I should see this film, but I insisted.  They were right--this movie scared the hell out of me, as no film had before or has since.  I had nightmares for weeks.

I watched the film many times during the next 10 years, first at matinees, then on the late show (it used to be a staple of late-night horror broadcasts).  Then the film virtually disappeared, until recently when TCM showed it now and then.  Although the movie doesn't have quite the same impact on me today as it did when I was 10, I still think it's damn scary.  And now FINALLY it's available on DVD.

Although the transformation scenes and the werewolf's appearance are frightening enough, the great things about this film are the acting (Steven Ritch in the title role gives a wonderful performance), the plot and script, and the location photography.  Also, it's one of the first films to combine horror with sci-fi.  And it's played straight--there's none of the silliness and self-parody that mars more recent entries in the werewolf genre.

I urge everyone who loves werewolf movies to check this one out.  And remember--in its day, this was one terrifying film!",1195689600,23,1703,4.519607843137255

2918266,4,B000UAFDR0,"An interesting but uneven collection aimed at fans of black and white ""B"" movies from the fifties. The Werewolf is actually a fairly well-acted story with a decent plot and some good photography and is the best movie in the collection by most conventional measures. The Creature with the Atomic Brain is typical 50's schlock with mediocre sets, a thin plot, and little suspense. Skipping over it wouldn't be a bad idea. The Giant Claw is wonderful, in the best traditions of late-night local TV ""Shock Theater"" shows. The Giant Claw--a huge vulture-like bird from outer space that for some unexplained reason decides to build multiple nests on Earth--is so awfully constructed and animated that it's difficult not to laugh when it appears on screen. Great over-the-top acting, unexplainable plot moves, and a truly stupid ending make this very watchable. The worst of the lot--certainly one of the worst movies I have ever seen--is Zombies of Mora Tau. Where to start? The acting is atrociously dispassionate. The plot makes no sense whatsoever. The sets look as if they were constructed for an elementary school play. The characters are shallow, the special effects are laughable, and the ending--well, you have to see it to believe it. Just awful in every respect.",1194393600,5,1266,5.033333333333333
2918267,4,B000UAFDR0,"Would really have enjoyed some audio commentaries, but a great set for the price-- and the movies, well, they just... wow. Giant Claw rules, by the way. I don't care what anybody says.",1193356800,7,184,4.606060606060606
2918268,5,B000UAFDR0,"So, just who the heck is Sam Katzman, anyway? Most boomers will remember these flicks from late-night ""Creature Features"" or Saturday afternoons with Sir Graves Ghastly, but never associated them together, much less with a specific producer. But Katzman was an old hand by the time these were made. He was the man who got Johnny Weismuller out of the leopard skin and into the safari gear as ""Jungle Jim"". He's generally credited for coining the term ""beatnik"". He did the ""East Side Kids"" movies, including two with Bela Lugosi. He was also the producer for two early Ray Harryhausen flicks, ""It Came From Beneath the Sea"" (with the lovable six-armed octopus) and ""Earth vs the Flying Saucers"". He even did a couple of Elvis pics: ""Harum Scarum"" and ""Kissin' Cousins"".

These four are from 1955-1957. ""Creature with the Atom Brain"" (1955) has an ex-Nazi (wow, were these guys into *every*thing!) creating atomic-powered zombies, complete with glowing serum in their veins. These middle-aged creeps stalk their victims to help a typical crime lord take over the city. They're hard to spot, except for the flip-top skulls. Story by Curt Siodmak, who sure came a long way downhill from his brilliant ""I Walked with a Zombie"".

The following year (and 10 movies later!), ""The Werewolf"" jumps out. No full moon needed here - he's a radioactive werewolf! (See a trend?) Poor guy gets in an auto wreck and some helpful docs fix him up with an experimental serum. You can guess the rest.....

""Zombies of Mora Tau"" is certainly original - these zombies are amphibious! They're the remains of a ship's crew, guarding a treasure of diamonds in the underwater wreck. These dudes are the original ""Terminators"" - shooting, stabbing, or whapping them in the skull with a board: makes no difference, they keep a'comin'.

And maybe the most (in)famous of all: ""The Giant Claw"", whose monster was so over-the-top ludicrous that it couldn't be featured on the film's poster. A giant, anti-matter, butt-ugly space buzzard from another galaxy! Play the ""Giant Claw"" drinking game at your own risk: every time someone says ""flying battleship"", it's down the hatch. May be extremely hazardous to your physical AND mental health.

Most people of a ""certain age"" will remember one or more of these from their heyday on TV. In spite of three different directors and (at least) four writers, all have a goofiness factor that only Ed Wood comes close to. Earnest, fast-paced, and always entertaining, these are great reminders of the time when Hollywood was cranking out flicks at a frantic pace and wasn't totally dependant on mega-bucks blockbusters. The sets are usually claustrophobic, 75% of the film seems to take place at night or in pitch-black settings (except for ""Claw""), and the ""plots"" are beyond unbelievable. In short - sit back and enjoy!",1193356800,13,2829,4.972515856236787
2918269,5,B000UAFDR0,"I'm a product of the baby boomin', drive-in crowd, and I craved films like this for their silliness, bad acting, and extreme entertainment value. I'd never seen ""Atom Brain"", but have been looking for the other 3 on DVD for a long time. Anyone who knows schlock horror MUST love Jeff Morrow, Allison Hayes & Richard Denning. The Werewolf is especially good for it's sweet simplicity; really a sad film about stuff that happens which is out of our control. The Giant Claw is terrific, with Mr. Morrow's customary over-acting and a big bird on strings. Atom Brain is OK, but was done better in ""Indestructible Man"" with the most under-rated Lon Chaney, Jr. My favorite is Zombies of Mora Tau, an absolutely riotous display of silly mixed with a reasonably good plot, with good characters. The beautiful Autumn Russell shines here; wonder whatever happened to her... I guess you had to be there at the outset, to REALLY enjoy these films. Make popcorn, turn out lghts and enjoy how black & white films can be effective.  This compilation offers trailers, a Mr. Magoo cartoon, a comedy short and an episode from a serial (Mysterious Island). It's a complete collection of fun stuff, that only the staid purist wouldn't enjoy. ADDED NOTE: The Giant Claw is practically the same movie as ""Kronos"" (also starring Jeff Morrow & Morris Ankrum)... anti-matter, etc.",1192924800,5,1355,4.865800865800866
2918270,4,B000UAFDR0,"Seeing these four films again, which were TV staples when I was growing up, makes me realize just how much I miss the drive-in theatres that they were made for. They not only provided cheap entertainment and a place to be alone with your certain someone but they also gave filmmakers the opportunity to make a wide variety of movies with limited resources. Scorsese, Coppola, and Spielberg first cut their teeth on films like these as viewers and then later as burgeoning low budget filmmakers.

Today no one cranks out films with the speed and efficiency that producer Sam Katzman did in the 50s and early 60s and that's truly a shame. Between 1955 and 1961 Katzman's Clover Productions turned out an astonishing 36 films for Columbia Pictures many of them directed by the two men represented here Fred F. Sears and Edward L. Cahn. Look them up on imdb for a complete listing of their films many of which are drive-in classics but too numerous to go into here.

Sears has the distinction of having the best and worst films in this set with THE WEREWOLF a surprisingly moody and moving film and THE GIANT CLAW with the worst giant monster ever. The poor actors never saw the creature until after it was added in which is why they treat it so seriously whereas the bird itself seems a deliberate parody of bad special effects.

""Fast Eddie"" Cahn as he was known in the trade shoots his two films CREATURE WITH THE ATOM BRAIN and ZOMBIES OF MORA TAU with as few edits as possible in order to economize and that makes them very interesting to watch if you're aware of this. CREATURE is the better film with a few genuine shocks and interesting technology while ZOMBIES seems a dry run for Cahn's cult classic INVISIBLE INVADERS a few years later.

To add to the fun Sony has thrown in trailers, a 1930s Columbia comedy short, and even a Mister Magoo cartoon. All the materials are beautifully transferred and you can't beat the price for what you get. Just like the drive-ins were in real life. Too bad they're a thing of the past but with this set you can certainly get a feel for what it was like. Pizza slices, cotton candy, and hot dogs are not included.",1192752000,13,2155,4.517948717948718
2918271,4,B000UAFDR0,"In the 50's, sci-fi/horror films were mostly aimed at the huge kid & teen markets (much like today) and were churned out regularly. This set  is a good example of the old ""make 'em fast and make 'em cheap"" school...with varying results.  Low budget, b&w and with casts often associated with the genre, these films conjure up memories of sitting glued to the TV screen while mom or dad worried about your homework not getting done or what these films were doing to your mind. We laugh about it now, but back then this is what horror films were until Hitchcock did ""Psycho"".  So, I'm glad to see them resurfacing on DVD and in nice prints like this set. Weird, goofy and lots of fun---for those of us who cherish those memories. I want to see more quality releases of these low budget goodies. Thanks Sony.  Enjoy.",1192579200,6,812,4.503401360544218

8212555,4,B000UAFDR0,"Four black & white sci-fi flicks from the late 50s.  Certainly not the best examples of that era, but acceptable in their own right.  The first is The Giant Claw.  It features a silly looking puppet bird held up by wires.  They wanted to get Ray Harryhausen to create the special effects but couldn't afford him.  Instead, they farmed out the creature to a studio in Mexico.  This is Montezumas revenge!  Jeff Morrow said he didn't know what the bird looked like until he saw the film in a theater.  He fled before anyone could recognize him.

The second movie is Creature with the Atom Brain.  That should be plural as there is a small army of these pseudo-zombies roaming the streets and causing mayhem.  The plot involves a deported gangster working with an ex-Nazi scientist to help him get revenge on his enemies.  Poor Richard Denning wanders around with a pipe, trying to look serious.

On the second disk they offer Zombies of Mora Tau.  This film involves a wife slapper and waterlogged zombies trying to protect their diamond booty hidden at the bottom of the sea.  Topside, the place is overrun by a cranky old lady who wants the diamonds dumped.  Supposedly this will release her zombie husband from his curse.

The last film is The Werewolf.  Some poor sap gets into a traffic accident and is treated off screen by a couple of unethical mad scientists who want him dead because of the unintended side effects that cause him to wolf-out at the most inconvenient times.  You cant help but feel sorry for him, becoming a murderer through no fault of his own.

None of these movies are especially good but they are often hilarious.  In the right frame of mind they are enjoyable.  Im partial to The Giant Claw and The Werewolf.",1495929600,,1736,4.604575163398692
