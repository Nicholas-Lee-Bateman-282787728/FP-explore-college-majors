8458542,2,B000KJTCFU,Although this does encompass some great former Sooner players. It disappointingly was very average at best. It has very limited game footage of most players on it & is more like a scouting report than of really memorable highlights & facts of the players. It is definitely overpriced for the length & content of the video. I unfortunately would not recommend this even for a die hard fan.,1359072000,,388,4.720588235294118
8458543,1,B000KJTCFU,"Don't waste your money on this poorly produced dog. The audio is so-so, but the video is weak in many places. Jason White looks like he's wearing an Iowa State uniform in his clips. It's blured and grainy in some spots. What really bites is the fact this video plays the same clip over and over and doesn't show a variety of plays these players made. They show Keith Jackson's TD reverse against Nebraska no less than 5 times. Then they show his TD catch against Penn St. about 7 times. Not once did they show his one-handed grab against Nebraska in '86. You will also love the 10 sec. of dead air and ZERO graphics b/t player clips! $22.91? It should be in the $4.99 bin at Wal-Mart. Sooner fans, there are a hell of a lot better videos out there than this one. BEAT THE HELL OUTTA TEXASS!!",1170201600,9,791,4.28
