8317393,4,B001L5Y79I,"Midnight Choir has come on the scene with 2 excellent double feature releases:  The Barbara Steele duo 'AN ANGEL FOR SATAN' and 'THE LONG HAIR OF DEATH' and this one highlighting 2 forays into the realm of torture.  Mario Bava's 'THE WHIP AND THE BODY' already had an excellent release by VCI Entertainment a few years back with a great audio commentary by Bava scribe Tim Lucas so there is nothing new here.  The reason to buy this package is for the historical tragedy ""CONSPIRACY OF TORTURE' aka 'BEATRICE CENCI', Lucio Fulci's symphony of the horrors of the Catholic Church's Inquisition and the rich and powerful running rampant in the 15th century.  The film resembles Ken Russell's masterpiece 'THE DEVILS' although this tale brings about the downfall of the Cenci family starting with the young daughter who is in league with her servant to slay her abusing father thereby sealing all of their fates with the towns elite and mother church.  The tortures are pretty grim , hey, its a Fulci movie but he directs with a tragic intensity that cannot be shaken throughout the films running time.  Michael Armstrong and Adrian Hovan will try to capture this films power with 'MARK OF THE DEVIL' many years later but Fulci's movie has more soul.  The transfer is excellent and is in English and 1.85 aspect ratio.  Round out your Fulci collection and enjoy his rare vision of an historical atrocity which may still be continuing to this day in some countries. Salute, Midnight Choir.",1284681600,6,1484,4.81496062992126
