2409747,5,B000BB18JK,Yet another great dvd realease from Media Blasters.  Definitly worth while.  Great Scifi story and great musical score by Ifukube.  Definitly worth buying if you are a Japanesse Scifi fan.,1206230400,,188,5.2
2409748,4,B000BB18JK,"Shades of the 60's ... hey ... this is good stuff!! There's just so much about Japanese Sci-Fi that's just plain fun to watch. You gotta use your imagination ... and don't let the fact that you sometimes can see the wire holding that submarine aloft. There's thrills, chills, and adventure ... and the good guys win at the end. Remember ... there were no computers for special effects when this was made.",1190332800,,404,4.5479452054794525
2409749,5,B000BB18JK,"I first saw this movie at a drive-in that had sliding boards and a pony ride.  It was all I could talk about for several days, even though I do not think most kids in my age group could even pronounce the title. It had everything:  super submarines, monsters, and the lost undersea empire of Mu.  It did not matter that the film was full of little absurdities.  Here was a high tech civilization where the soldiers ran around carrying spears. You had the dubbing, which my parents found amusing, but I did not care.  As a cinematic experience, it was similar to watching the old Universal Flash Gordon Serials.  The plot was improbable. There were wobbly space ships, comic opera costumes, and virtually no believable science.  There was also a villain who name should have been:  ""Ming the incredibly tolerant of inept henchmen."" It just did not matter. These films have a way of sweeping up the viewer and suspending disbelief.  In the movie, ""Ed Woods,"" the title character says ""No one will notice,"" when a backer pointed to a wobbly cardboard tombstone.  He was right, as long as the director knew what he was doing.  The guys at TOHO knew what they were doing.  Ed Woods, sadly, did not.

  It was surprisng and a little dissappointing that the movie got poor distribution in the VHS era and very little television air time, if any.  Up until a few years ago, Atrigan was being distributed by a ""hard to find"" video distributor for over $30.  The DVD is immaculate--no scratches and great sound quality.  This film is a lost gem that is finally getting exposure after an absence of two generations.",1160352000,8,1604,4.627659574468085

This film also covers some fairly intense topics involving WWII and Japanese militarism and would be of considerable interest to students of Japanese history.

Additionally, seen in pristine condition with subtitles, one can finally appreciate the effort Toho put into these movies. Acting is superb and art direction is as good as it gets for the era.",1146182400,5,630,5.166666666666667
2409752,5,B000BB18JK,"This is yet another great Tokyo Shock DVD from Media Blasters. Superb! More please!!! How about a better version of 'Destroy All Monsters' in 16X9 next? Or, 'Lake Of Dracula'?",1139011200,7,175,4.866666666666666
2409753,4,B000BB18JK,"Geez, Louise...if'n it ain't a giant monster trashing Tokyo, it's some uppity, advanced civilization of war mongering peoples living on a continent that sunk to the bottom of the ocean long ago desperate to regain that which they lost, specifically domination over the entire planet...Atragon (1965), originally known as Kaitei gunkan (1963), directed by the legendary Ishir Honda (Godzilla, Godzilla, King of the Monsters!, The Mysterians), features a strong cast of Toho regulars including Tadao Takashima (Son of Godzilla), Yko Fujiyama (Dagora, the Space Monster), Ken Uehara (Mothra), Jun Tazaki (Destroy All Monsters), Kenji Sahara (Ghidrah, the Three-Headed Monster), and Yu Fujiki (Yog: Monster from Space).

The first half of the film introduces us to many of the main characters in the story, and also relates how an ancient civilization called the Mu empire has begun to try and regain control of the world, apparently something they had in the past (they claim all surface dwelling peoples are colonies of the Mu), but lost due to the fact the continent they were living on had the nerve to sink to the bottom of the ocean some 12,000 years ago.  Okay, seems to me if these people were so advanced, they would have moved to another, more stable continent before or around the time theirs took a nose dive rather than go through all the trouble and effort to develop a vast, undersea city, but what the heck do I know?  I'm just a gaijin...anyway, the Mu empire, perhaps tired of pruned fingers and smelling like fish, begin a campaign to subjugate the peoples of the Earth using their superior technology delivering destruction and mayhem, threatening to destroy everything unless the receive full compliance.  To show they mean business, they blow up...a cargo ship...seriously...but then they come full on with the pain wiping out Tokyo utilizing underground earthquakes.  Okay, that's a bit more impressive.  Seems the only thing the Muans fear is a sophisticated submarine called the Atragon, created by a Japanese naval officer Captain Hachiro Jinguji (Tazaki) who ran off at the end of WWII rather than face the disgrace of surrendering, and has since been in hiding, developing this amazing vessel with the intent on returning someday and serving his country.  Given the threat of global destruction, some of his fellow countrymen manage to locate the captain and his secret base, and try to convince him to come out of hiding to face the Mu threat, but he's too wrapped up in his own patriotism to care about what happens to the rest of the world, wanting only to return for the glory of Japan...or something like that.  Anyway, all bets are off when the Muans kidnap the captain's daughter, threatening to feed her to their giant sea serpent called Manda if he doesn't agree to destroy Atragon.  Captain Jinguji subsequently kicks it into high gear, unleashing the full power of Atragon against the Muans, with the fate of the planet at stake.

I had a great time watching this film, not only because of the amazing effects employed throughout, but also because it had a really solid story as a backbone.  The first ten minutes or so might be a little confusing, as there's bits with various individuals being kidnapped by nefarious looking types, but things clear up soon enough once past the opening credits, as more of the story presents itself.  Honda's direction is extremely strong, keeping things paced well, especially given the complexity of the story and the lack of real action in the front end of the feature...and this would probably be my only gripe that I wanted to see more of the super sub in action.  What we do get is loaded up mainly in the last twenty minutes or so of the film.  The battle scenes we do see are really impressive, so much so I lost sight of the fact most all of it was done with miniatures, given the apparent intense amount of detail and attention given to their construction.  The effects work here, under the direction of Eiji Tsuburaya, is top notch, especially given the time the film was made, in the early 1960s.  As far as the Atragon, it's a real piece of work, featuring moving parts, further helping to create a sense of realism.  The sub was a wicked long, cylindrical tube with a giant drill bit on the front, along with various blades that deployed from the sides, allowing it the ability to not only cruise the seas, but burrow into the Earth.  And not only that, but it could fly!  It had a fairly normal complement of both offensive and defensive weapons, along with something called an instant freeze cannon, which does exactly what it sounds like it does...my favorite sequence in the film is when Captain Jinguji goes balls-to-the-walls attacking the Muans head-on by boring through the sea floor and busting through into the Muan core power center for some awesoma destruction.  In a nice touch, Captain Jinguji did offer a chance for peace, but the Muans declined (good thing too, as otherwise the story would have died out quickly).  The giant monster called Manda, whom the Muans saw as their deity's messenger, did look a little hokey, but given it's limited amount of screen time and the many strengths in this feature (the directing, the acting, the effects, etc.), this was a minor aspect for me.  Another superior element of this film is the original musical scoring by Akira Ifukube, who seemed to have an innate sense in creating music befitting these types of films.  I don't normally notice the accompanying music in films unless it's really poor and ill fitting, or unless it's really outstanding and right on the money, the latter being the case here.  There were two things in this film I could have done without the first being that massive, Muan native dance sequence, which was impressive, but pointless, and the second being the photographer's comical assistant.  There must have been a clause in some Toho contracts that forced the inclusion of at least one comically challenged comic relief in their films, one who manages to survive all the way through, much to my dismay.  It wasn't as bad here as I've seen in other films, but the presence of such character didn't go unnoticed.  Regardless, Atragon is a great film, especially if you enjoy early Japanese science fiction adventure films.

Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock provides an excellent release here, with a beautiful looking widescreen (2.35:1) anamorphic transfer.  Also included are a number of audio tracks including Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround in both English and Japanese, along with Dolby Digital mono, again in both English and Japanese (I'd recommend the Japanese audio with available English subtitles).  Special features include an original theatrical trailer for the film, along with a feature length commentary track with Koji Kajita, who served as chief assistant director on the film.  Also thrown in are previews for other worthwhile Media Blaster DVD releases like The Mysterians (1959), Varan the Unbelievable (1962), Dogora (1964), and Mantango: Attack of the Mushroom People (1963).

2409754,5,B000BB18JK,"A big hand goes out to Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock, whom have really delivered the goods again! Although I appreciate Sony's efforts with the GODZILLA DVD series, it has seemed half-hearted in comparison to what MB has given us with ""the other classics"" from the Golden Age of Toho, such as VARAN, MATANGO, MYSTERIANS and DOGORA. The picture quality is excellent, and we're given 5 choices for audio: Japanese and English Mono, Japanese and English 5.1, and a commentary from assistant director Koji Kajita. The latter is in Japanese, but (as in their disc for THE MYSTERIANS) is provided a choice in English subtitled form. It's great to relax and listen to the English track, and have the commentary running below. On the subject of the English dub, no, this is not the AIP English dub, but a servicable original Toho ""international"" dub. The 5.1 version, in fact, seems to have be a nicely done homebrew mix by MB, easing the pain a little ;) . All-in-all, a fantastic presentation, a wonderful classic SF/F story featuring a great cast of Toho's familiar faces, and the brilliant talents of the fantastic trio, Honda, Tsuburaya and Ifukube.",1138665600,21,1143,4.896907216494846

2409760,4,B000BB18JK,"I had fond memories of this movie as a kid.  A flying submarine! With a giant drill! Vast scenes of destruction!  Only one goofy monster which did not have much screen time. (I did not like the Toho rubber monsters.)

Then there were decades when the movie was barely available on awful looking VHS tapes, panned and scanned in LousyColor. At last here it is in beautifully photographed Fuji color in a pristine full-frame transfer, uncut and with a serviceable English voice track.  Now I realize my youth might not have been wasted after all, since it was flights of fantasy like this one which drew me into a continuing career in the movie business.",1403481600,5,652,4.643478260869565
2409761,4,B000BB18JK,"This 1963 Sci-Fi Japanese action creation dubbed into English has a simple story of saving the world from an undersea evil and belligerent Mu Empire.  This film is in poor Toho Scope color but provides average picture quality in Blu-ray machines and 1080 P screens.  The movie is a definite upgrade to the original B&W GODZILLA films of the fifties we loved as children.  However, special effects are disappointing from that era compared to the 21 Century.
I enjoyed seeing a submarine fly and then drill through the earth.",1389139200,3,523,4.853932584269663

2409763,5,B000BB18JK,"It was Wednesday (merchant's night). This was part of all-night Japanese Festival in the 60's. This looks like they used all the old Gojira sets for this movie Kaitei Gunkan.

This was the first time I heard of the Mu Empire.

Looks like Mu is back and the only thing they fear is a renegade Captain Hachiro Jinguji (Jun Tazaki) and his Undersea Battleship Atragon. They want him and his little girl Makoto (Y'ko Fujiyama) too.

We get a Mu dance that rivals that of the one in ""King Kong"". We see their god Monda that looks just like one of my cats only with scales. Speaking of scales we get the standard 60's models of ships and cities, which are part of the charm of these movies.

Now the question is will Mu win and we become Mulan full of mu-tants. Or can Atragon save the day?

For the DVD people we are in luck as there is a voice commentary. Only problem is it is in Japanese. We get the mechanics of the movie and tid-bits like because it was 1964 which was the year of the dragon, the kaiju (monster) toot the form of a dragon. We also get treated to insights on related films.",1383091200,2,1089,4.216346153846154
2409764,4,B000BB18JK,"During mid 50s to 60s before film industries lost grace with the rising tide of TV dramas, Toho created a number of great sci-fi films also loved by moviegoers around the world. Atragon a.k.a. Kaitei Gunkan originally relaesed in Japan in 1963 is one of them. And this is one of the Eiji Tsuburaya's works on SFX with no Godzillas or Ultra Heroes. Although Godzilla series with Kaiju(monster) battles are targeted mainly for children this sci-fi film was intended for older audience. Drama part is excellently made. The part of the reasons is the presence of Captain Jinguji who represented the some of older generation of Japanese people at that time who served their lives for the Emperor and still dreamed of reviving Japan Imperial Army to redress the second world war defeat. Captain Jinguji's strong insistence that the secret super-submarine would only be used for the rematch against the US forces is somewhat comparable to that of Captain Nemo of 20000 leagues under the sea. After repeated efforts to pursuade the captain, he finally decides to fight for greater cause: to save the humankind from Muan attacks. The drama superbly captured the tide of Japan when it sought for the greater role in international community. Tsuburaya showcases his expertise in special effects. Particularly I like the way giant dragon creature Manda appeared for the first time. Pyrotechnics are really work of art. Mu empress performed by Tetsuko Kobayashi is impressive as well.

Izu Oshima Island about 100 kilometer south of Tokyo is used for the location of Muan attack scene and a number of occasions. ""Back Desert(Moon Desert)"" of the island is often used for Toho Sci-fi films and a number of sentai dramas because of its lunar landscape.

Verdict: Great sfx works of Tsuburaya, well-crafted drama.
Rating: 85 out of 100
Recommended for: Toho film fans. Classic sci-fi film fans.",1370390400,,1878,5.016025641025641

2409766,5,B000BB18JK,"Circa1963 Atragon was ahead of its time. A flying submarine with a giant drill on the front. What more could you ask for?The ancient undersea city of Mu is attacking the surface dwellers of Earth! Atragon to the rescue! The movie is in color. Somthing that was lost on me when I first saw it years ago on B&W tv. Not a bad flick for an early delve into the Japanese monster/si fi craze. The monster Manda, a dragon and protector of Mu is pretty lame and does not show up until almost the end of the movie. However I consider Atragon a must see for any fan of early japanese si fi or man in rubber suit monster flicks.",1365638400,2,617,4.15
2409767,2,B000BB18JK,"This movie outright sucks.  There is no plot in the movie and if there was a plot, I missed it.  The acting was terrible and the special effects was done by a third-string team that Toho somehow continued to employ.  Not Toho's best produced movie.  The monster Manda looks like it was put together by 3 year old kids with no imagination.  Overall not a great movie and would not recommend for anyone to get.",1358985600,,408,4.386666666666667
2409768,5,B000BB18JK,"When I was 10 years old or so, my guardian wanted to go carouse the bar circuit in a little town in southern Ohio. This was 1964 or so. He dropped me off at the movie theatre he found and I swear on the big marquee it said the movie name was ""Astrogon"". May have been me being young or whatever but I interpeted the movie as being named ""Astrogon"" and have been searching for that movie by that name for quite a number of years. Just for nostalgia but also because I did really enjoy it. You know when you enjoy a movie in the theatre when you don't get up to get snacks or use the restroom. I was guilty on both counts.

I really thought the submarine was cool and it did a lot of impressive things. The world or worlds created in the film had me believing that they really existed and then of course the notion of the ""landlubbers"" being ""hostages"" of the captain of the vessel made it all the more engaging. With that it seems to be a little of a 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea type of story but I only drew the paralells much after I had grown up.

Very glad I decided to look in Wikipedia where I found I was calling it the wrong thing but very happy that I found it here to order. Brings back some memories and few people know of little gems like this movie.",1299024000,,1262,4.044
2409769,5,B000BB18JK,"If I were to choose a movie to introduce people to the wonderful world of Japanese Monster Movies, Atragon would be near the top of that list.  Made during the end of Toho's Golden Decade (1954-1963), Atragon is the ultimate in fantasy film entertainment.  Sekizawa's script has everything: kidnappings, submarine chases, underground empires, giant swimming dragons and flying submarines.  But the film's major asset is its human story of a fanatical naval captain who is determined to re-establish Japan's military prestige...even at the cost of being reunited with a daughter he has not seen in 20 years.
The film represents the best that Toho had to offer: a wonderful cast, dazzling special effects, a brilliant musical score, a grand scope...all held together by Ishiro Honda's sincere direction.  Preserved in the fabulous color and widscreen format, Atragon is still one of the most entertaining, moving and spectacular fantasy films in the history of the cinema.

2409770,4,B000BB18JK,"Seldom seen in the West, Atragon was one of Toho's most elaborate productions of the early 1960s. Based on Shunro Oshikawa's 1902 novel of the same name, Shinichi Sekizawa's screenplay offers a deeply patriotic theme, well-drawn characters, a flying super-submarine, and the inevitable daikaiju (Manda, the sea serpent). Despite some occasionally weak visuals, the film's top-tier cast, fine direction by Ishiro Honda, and rousing score by Akira Ifukube make for an entertaining hour and a half.

The extras Media Blasters/Tokyo Shock customarily provides for its Toho releases are absent from this package--only trailers and a commentary by Koji Kujita, the film's assistant director. Regardless, the widescreen print is excellent, with a choice of English subtitles or dubbing (though inferior to the Titra dub of the original 1963 U.S. release). Interestingly, the title Atragon was a shortening of ""Atlantis Dragon""--a reference to Manda, the movie's briefly seen daikaiju. However, the super-submarine star of the film (the Goten-Go) assumed the name Atragon, and the English dialogue erroneously refers to it as such.

The story touches on fervent Japanese nationalism, with Goten-Go commander Jinguji being a diehard patriot who refuses the nations of the world the use of his super-weapon against the undersea Mu Empire, which plans to dominate the surface. However, as you might guess, this mindset cannot prevail, and the character-centered, politically charged human drama gives way to an action-packed special-effects extravaganza. Atragon is one of Toho's landmark features, and despite the lack of extras, this DVD is a rare gem for daikaiju addicts.",1265500800,4,1664,5.573122529644269

The storyline is original and different from most other Toho creations. But that is a good thing. The cast consists of many familiar actors from the Godzilla series, as well as other Toho monster movies.

Manda is well designed, too bad he was never used as much as he should have been (particularly in the Godzilla series). His movements remind me of when I first saw this film.

Overall, Atragon is a excellently done film. It is worth buying and the price is great. It's not too expensive and you get plenty of entertainment. So buy it and enjoy. :)",1215561600,,737,4.485074626865671

So when I read about this movie and seen both the American and Japanese trailers, it looked and sounded good. Kind of like a Godzilla movie combined with Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, which I'm a huge fan of. Unfortunately what I got was a total let down. As my title described, this movie is extremely boring with hardly any action in it what so ever. On top of that it's incredibly cheesy and the ending is rushed. And if you prefer your Japanese movies dubbed your going to be disappointed because it has terrible dubbing with lots of it not making any sense and cheesy as hell. And in the English subtitles for the Japanese version, they have two names for the submarine: Gotengo and Atragon, but in the English dubbed version it's only ever referred to as Gotengo which makes the title of the movie meaningless. The movie itself might not have been too bad still if only it had more action in it. But with the slow nature of the film on top of everything else wrong with it, it's hard for me to like this one.
