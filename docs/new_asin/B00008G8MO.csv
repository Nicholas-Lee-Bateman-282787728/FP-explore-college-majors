1844156,3,B00008G8MO,"Loved Chong since childhood and Basketball Jones !

He's AWESOME on that 70's show too. THis is a great addition to your Cheech and CHong collection, and Cheech even does a small appearance in this one. BUt you still hope through the movie, it will be good ole Cheech and Chong together again for at least one last time. I certainly hope someone soon say Urine Luck dude! Cheech and Chong reunion movie coming soon ! PLEASE !!!!!!

1844157,4,B00008G8MO,"I saw an ad for this in (popular stoner magazine) a few years back, thought ""Hey, I'd like to get that!"", and then promptly forgot about it.  I rediscovered it while searching through Amazon.com for stoner comedies, and after seeing Tommy Chong's own review, decided I HAD to have it.

Basically, I loved it.  Yep, a little weak in places, but they weren't trying to make a cinematic masterpiece here.  I'd put this in the same category as movies like ""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"" or, in a more similar time period, ""The Adventures of Ford Fairlane: Rock and Roll Detective"" starring Andrew Dice Clay, one of my favorite cheeseball comedies from the late eighties/early nineties.

Oh, and that's one other thing - I could've SWORN this movie was made (and released) recently - the copyright on the DVD says 2001, and all the reviews and info I read led me to believe it was a recent flick.  Maybe just an oversight on my part, but it was actually made in 1989.  Personally, that makes it even MORE enjoyable for me, as I love finding flicks that I missed in my youth, and get to see now for the first time.  Then I get to show it to all of my friends, who are then similarly amazed that THEY hadn't heard of it, either.  It's definitely a fun hobby :)

[** A FEW VERY MINOR SPOILERS AHEAD, FOR THOSE WHO HAVEN'T WATCHED IT YET **]

So anyway, like ""Ford Fairlane"", this movie is hit & miss at times, but when it hits, it hits great, with some real goofball humor that you'll be instantly quoting with your friends at the end of the movie.  Also like ""Ford Fairlane"", this movie had a bunch of cool cameos, either playing random characters, or more typically, playing themselves.  The brief Cheech spot was UTTERLY unexpected and was one of the biggest laughs of the movie.  Dokken jamming out at Tommy's house was also an unexpected sight.  C Thomas Howell's scene with Judd Nelson was simply AMAZING, with Howell being utterly floored that Judd Nelson had never heard of him.  (Like Howell, I also thought Nelson kicked much butt in ""From The Hip"", another infrequently seen but highly enjoyable 80s comedy)  Howell's line, ""You've seen (random porn title) but never saw RED DAWN?!?"" was a laugh-riot, and I totally agree.  Did Judd Nelson live under a rock in the eighties, or what?  RED DAWN = MUST SEE MOVIE!

In conclusion, I really, REALLY liked this movie.  Mad respect to Tommy Chong and family for putting this together.  In the end, I guess Martin Mull's hypnotic suggestion (""You'll like this movie.  Tell a friend."") made an actual impression on me.  I liked this movie, and I'll be telling a LOT of friends.  Check this out for sure - as long as you love goofy comedies, you'll dig it.  It's far out, man.  :)",1120435200,4,2722,4.535934291581109
1844158,5,B00008G8MO,"Tommy Chong is a comic genious, his wife is hot, and this movie will make you laugh your butt off. Whether he's sharing a bathtub with a punk chick, making cocaine from pharmacy products, or just flashbacking to 'HippieLand', Tommy Chong will have you in stitches. Yes, yes there are people who will not get it or dismiss this as 'low-brow stoner' comedy. But you know what? We need movies like this! Bless you Tommy, you are well loved, much appreciated, and your movies rule.",1119744000,2,477,4.623529411764705
1844159,4,B00008G8MO,"Wow, I can't believe Tommy himself actually put in his 2 cents here. But his words are very accurate. Hey, this isn't ""War And Peace"" here.

I had never heard of this movie at all until I caught it on cable several years ago. It seems they did NO TV advertising or hype for this film at all.

I knew nothing about it when I first watched it and I was in hysterics the entire time!

I would say this easily is as good-OR BETTER-than ANY of the Cheech And Chong movies. I've seen all of those. To be honest, they're still funny but it is quite easy to tell there was allot of improvisation going on in those films. That's no hit on Cheech at all for I feel his ""Born In East LA"" is a fine film as well.

When i'm in the mood for that type of humour now, I always pull out my new DVD copy of ""Far Out Man"".

For the price you can't beat it. I just hope it would have received the attention that the Cheech And Chong movies did.

To top it off you get to see Tommy's real-life family, another plus for somebody who's been a fan of his since about 1969.

Tommy's breakfast cooking scene at the beginning of the film is simply classic Cheech & Chong type humour.

I hope Tommy gets to  do another of these!!!",1107820800,12,1202,4.016806722689076
1844160,4,B00008G8MO,"Far Out Man is not a bad movie.  I enjoyed it a lot (maybe because I was in it).  If you are looking for an in depth plot, or even a ""Cheech and Chong"" THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU.  But if you are just looking for a light laugh, hey man, this is a funny one.  If you are a Chong fan (or are Tommy) like me, this movie has most of Chong's family in it.  This movie's a ""heavy hitter"".
Hope this helped.",1089504000,57,403,3.63953488372093
1844161,5,B00008G8MO,"I agree with the previous reviewer that the previous reviewer before him needs to lighten up. First of all sherlock, there's so many people with the same last name because it's really chongs family. He sort of mixes his real life into a fictional plot. It's not meant to be anything scientific as you may have expected, just a fun movie about hippie culture(which you don't seem to know a lot about, or you'd get the movie more) But there is a lot of clever satire throughout the film, maybe if you paid attention, ya know? open your mind a bit, man.",1052092800,7,550,4.401960784313726

It's cool because all the ""Cheech & Chong"" humor is there without Cheech - although he makes a guest appearance - It's also interesting that the movie is made with Chong's family; his wife, his son, his daughter and her husband ((C Thomas Howell was married to Rae Dawn Chong))  Definitely a fun movie, you should buy it!!",1404259200,,384,4.4714285714285715

1844340,5,B00008G8MO,"Hello Tommy Chong!
Far out man is my favorite movie ever by you. Love all the actors, your wife Shelby Chong is Beautiful, and your son is funny! The movie will bring you some awesome laughs. Starting out with Dokken as Chong's personal friends who jam at his house, to C Thomas Howell in Jail, To the Psychiatrist Marten Mull to Ray Dawn Chong's role too!
At the Drug Store buying ""white powder"", you know that looks like coke, and some extra Niacin for the Rush! ~ From Baltimore to Cocomo I've done my score with Blow!!! CLASSIC COMEDY GENIUS!!
The band is too funny but you should have turned on Tree's microphone, and hiring that stripper to be a singer, maybe not the best move. But what hurts most was Tree cutting all your patches out of your Jeans  man, that's just rough...
Hippie Land is way too funny, and the shorted out guitar is hilarious!
""You're somewhere between a Plankton and a Toaster"" CLASSIC!!!!!
Love the movie Tommy and I tell everyone about FAR OUT MAN. I still find it amazing this movie did not get a larger following when it was in the theaters because it truly is a comic work of art!",1318204800,,1114,4.407766990291262

1844342,4,B00008G8MO,"Critics hated this film, the public didn't like it much either, but when I saw it, I liked it a lot.  I recently revisited it, and it's still funny.  Some of the 80's references are dated, but much of it is still hysterical.  It's far better than Cheech and Chong's Still Smokin' and The Corsican Brothers, a lot better.  Everyone gives pretty good performances, especially C. Thomas Howell (who plays himself, ironically enough.  He's absolutely hysterical), and Reyanldo Rey as a manager who ""employs"" Chong as a roadie.  It has a weird flow to it like most of Chong's directorial work does.  It works really well.  There's also some nice shots of California's rolling mountain ranges, something you don't see too often.  Cheech has a funny cameo, and many of the movie's songs were co-written or written by Chong himself.

It ain't a masterpiece, but it's worthwhile and a lot better than its reputation.",1275350400,,907,4.8311688311688314
1844343,5,B00008G8MO,"Absolutely a classic. I loved this movie but I am a big fan of Cheech & Chong.  A lot of scenes that take you back to older funny movies.
