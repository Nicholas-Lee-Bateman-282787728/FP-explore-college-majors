8414905,4,B0043GH8Q6,The film is now restored by ABS-CBN in Manila with a fresh showing at the University of the Philippines in Sept 2015 for the 20th anniversary.  The 2-fer version for sale here is not that restoration.  Perhaps one day it will again become available.,1441843200,,249,4.636363636363637
8414906,2,B0043GH8Q6,"The quality of the videos are below par - dark and grainy, especially ""Sana Maulit Muli"".
Also, the video itself would go black for a second and the sound cuts in and out in ""Got 2 Believe"".

I think if the video quality were better, we would be a happier with the product.
But unfortunately, you know you're watching an old movie because the quality mimics the playback of a dusty VHS.

I want to note that the one star review doesn't necessarily apply to the seller.
The seller was responsive and courteous, I appreciate that.
The seller certainly deserves 4-5 stars for their customer service and their shipping time.",1357776000,,620,4.627272727272727
