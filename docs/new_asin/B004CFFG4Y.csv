8422971,5,B004CFFG4Y,"After experiencing Cynthia's Yoga Video my 9 year old daughter Faith wrote the following reminder note to herself for the next day (ie her ""to do"" list!)

""Remember... teach my friends the yoga I learned from Cynthia's video instead of cheerleading."" I must agree with her choice in activities! Yoga is benefiting my daughter Faith and her twin sister in many ways. Thank you Cynthia for having an intergenerational appeal! We love your clear and gentle way and practice using your video together as a family.
