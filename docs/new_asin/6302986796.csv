7833367,5,6302986796,"Great video of the '72 World Series that was such a contrast in styles. The colorful Moustache Gang Swingin' A's vs. the button-down Big Red Machine. Reds manager Sparky Anderson is miked up for some scenes.

The video is narrated by Curt Gowdy (who was everywhere back in the '70s). they throw in some clips of the NLCS and ALCS so we get to see the infamous bat flinging at Tigers pitcher Lerrin LaGrow by the A's shortstop and top base stealer Bert Campaberis after LaGrow intentionally threw at Campy. We also see the injury A's star slugger Reggie Jackson suffers in the ALCS on a slide home that puts him out of the World Series.

The series itself is one of the best ones of the decades featuring a lot of one-run games and plenty of ebb and flow plus the surprise hero of the Series in A's catcher turned slugger Gene Tenace.",1314316800,,833,4.402597402597403
7833368,5,6302986796,"1972's World Series featured the long-haired Oakland A's vs. the highly-favored, straight-laced, low-socks-wearing Cincinnati Reds (aka: ""The Big Red Machine"").  And what a dandy Series it was in '72. It went the limit of seven games, with six of them being decided by just a single run.

The only game that wasn't ultra-close was Game 6 at Cincinnati, when the Reds, with their backs to the wall, came up with a decisive 8-1 win, which included a big 5-run seventh inning to seal the victory and tie the Series at three games apiece -- setting the stage for the Reds to possibly get into the World Series record book by becoming the first team ever to come back and win a Fall Classic after losing the first two games at home.

But, this wasn't to be, as the A's rallied in Game 7 with 2 runs in the 6th inning, and held on to nip Cincy, 3-2. The attendance for Game 7 at Cincinnati's two-year-old Riverfront Stadium was 56,040, which is the second-largest crowd ever to see a baseball game in Cincinnati (surpassed only by the 56,393 who watched the Reds and Red Sox do battle in Game 5 of the 1975 World Series) . Unfortunately for the large group of Reds' fans, Dick Williams' Athletics proved too tough in Game 7, and Cincy rooters, for the second time in three years, again suffered through the disappointment of losing in a World Series. In 1970, in Sparky Anderson's debut season as Cincinnati manager, it was the Baltimore Orioles taking down the Big Red Machine in just 5 games.

To give you an idea of just how close and statistically-balanced this 1972 World Series turned out to be, just take a look at these figures.........

TEAM AT-BATS:

OAK. -- 220

CIN. -- 220

TEAM HITS:

OAK. -- 46

CIN. -- 46

TEAM BATTING AVERAGE:

OAK. -- .209

CIN. -- .209

Almost unbelievable, huh? The two teams had identical club batting stats during the seven Series contests. The Reds, even in losing 4 games to 3, actually outscored Oakland in the Series, by a count of 21-16 (thanks to Cincy's win by seven runs in the sixth game).

Another stat that had the Reds way out in front of the Athletics in this Series was ""Stolen Bases"" -- with the Reds pilfering 12 bases to the A's 1. Reds' outfielder Bobby Tolan swiped 5 bases to lead in that category.

Pitching (on both sides) kept the hitters at bay for the most part during this Series, with the two teams each compiling excellent team Earned-Run Averages for the seven games. The Reds' team ERA was 2.17; while Oakland's was 3.05.

Star A's outfielder Reggie Jackson suffered a leg injury in the A.L. Playoffs vs. Detroit, and was unable to participate in the '72 World Series, which made it even more unlikely that the A's would be able to defeat the powerful and speedy Reds.

And if it had not been for a catcher-first baseman by the name of Gene Tenace, the Reds just might have been victorious. The A's swatted 5 home runs in this World Series, and Tenace had 4 of them (including two in his first two at-bats in Game 1 at Riverfront Stadium). Ultimately, Mr. Tenace was voted the 1972 World Series MVP.

Both the American League and the National League Championship Series also went the full gamut of games in '72, with the A's topping the Tigers and Cincy pulling out an incredible come-from-behind, last-minute, 5th-game triumph over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NLCS.

I can easily search my memory banks and recall in an instant watching that fifth and final game of the 1972 NLCS on television. It was a rainy Wednesday late afternoon (October 11) at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium when Reds' catcher Johnny Bench (the '72 N.L. MVP) led off the bottom of the ninth inning by smacking a rare opposite-field homer to right field off of Pirates' ace reliever Dave Giusti, tying Game 5 at 3-3.

And just a few minutes later, with the pennant-winning run (pinch-runner George Foster) on third base, Bucs' relief pitcher Bob Moose threw a wild pitch past catcher Manny Sanguillen, which sent future N.L. MVP Foster scurrying home with the run that sent Cincy to the '72 World Series. A heart-stopping ending indeed, as the crowd of 41,887 at Riverfront roared with approval as Foster crossed home plate.

1972 was the beginning of Oakland's ""mini-dynasty"" in the early 1970s. After topping Cincinnati in '72, the Athletics then went on to capture the '73 world title vs. the Mets, and then made it a ""three-peat"" with a victory over Los Angeles in 1974. The Red Sox finally got the best of Oakland in 1975, sweeping the A's in the ALCS. That was the year when the Reds really got going as well, winning the '75 World Series over Boston and then making it two straight titles by sweeping the Yankees in '76.

This VHS cassette from MLB Home Video runs for approx. 41 minutes, and guides us through the seven games of the '72 Series very nicely, including some extra interview segments with many of the players. The video is narrated by veteran broadcaster Curt Gowdy. This program is a great way to re-live those October days in 1972, when the Oakland A's and Cincinnati Reds battled for seven great games to determine the year's Major-League champions.",1099872000,2,5114,4.620309050772627
7833369,4,6302986796,"If you remember the 1972 World Series or are a younger baseball fan who loves the game's rich history, this video is worth checking out. The film, done right after the Series ended, begins with somewhat grainy kinescope footage (in color) of the Cincinnati-Pittsburgh matchup in the National League Championship Series, and then the ALCS between Oakland and Detroit. Both Championship Series went the full five games for the first time ever in '72, so it's fitting that we get some sense of how hard these teams had to fight to get to the Fall Classic. Then, after an amusing attempt to contrast the clean-shaven, conservative-looking Reds with the mustachioed, colorfully-uniformed A's, the film shifts to the Series itself.
All the obvious highlights are here -- Gene Tenace's HRs, Joe Rudi's great catch, the A's brilliant Game 4 victory achieved through three straight pinch hits in the ninth, etc. But what was most interesting to me was not only that the favored Reds lost the first two games at home, and subsequently fell behind 3 games to 1, but that they were one of the rare teams to win Games Five and Six and yet lose Game Seven. So often, with the momentum of those two wins, a team coming back from 3-1 is able to pull out Game Seven as well. The fact that they fought back so hard, and that the A's were still good enough to hold them down in a Game Seven at Cincinnati, is a testament to the high quality of both teams, and the film does an excellent job of conveying this.
The print that's used here isn't pristine, but looks good enough considering its age. Overall, the production values are similar to, if not quite up to the standard of, a typical NFL Films production of the period.",1053388800,4,1705,4.593442622950819
