8737382,4,B016VIPG2Q,"Received my set today and have already watched 3 discs with friends and family.  Films run about 50-ish minutes.
Extraordinary HD high-speed photography with pretty decent sound (mostly music during sports sequences). One audio track and no subtitles on the 3 discs I've watched.
NTSC plays on Region A and B (random sample of 4 discs had no issue with Region B).  I have not tested Region C.
NOTE these are UNRATED and contain the cussing you might expect from people who do the bat(expletive)-crazy stunts in these films.  Probably not a problem for teens, but might teach young ones some new vocabulary. Just saying.
The photography which puts you right there with the athletes, many aerial shots, multiple camera shots, slow motion, etc.  Colors that pop. It will put you on the edge of your seat!

So, if you enjoy the Red Bull extreme sports short videos often seen on TV, I expect you will also enjoy this set.",1458259200,,917,4.70625
