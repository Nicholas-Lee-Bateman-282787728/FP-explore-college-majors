6821762,3,B00PULRRF0,Meh. This is barely sci fi. It's mostly about a couple in a new relationship that starts with a slow dance in a bar just as the world is about to end. Tiny glimpses of the sci fi part of this film occur at very random intervals but are not the focus of the story. Great actors but they need a better film.,1421971200,20,305,3.857142857142857

6821765,4,B00PULRRF0,"This is more a well-acted drama about relationships and procreation in the context of the possible end of human civilization than it is a ""sci-fi"" movie. The science fiction aspect of this movie remains in the background, literally, as a young couple go through all the phases of their relationship. The narrative jumps backwards and forwards in time -- you can keep track by the length of the star's beard. It kept my interest throughout but the ending didn't leave me feeling satisfied, just a bit confused. Not sure the title works either! Still, a good movie with superb acting, especially from the stunning Gillian MacGregor, whom I hope to see more of in the future. I can't take my eyes off her!",1421884800,,702,4.715447154471545

6821770,1,B00PULRRF0,Incredibly scattered movie!  All over the place.  Two story lines - of the SAME characters going at the same time - keeps switching between them.  Hard to build a coherent thought as to what is really going on.  Leaves you hanging on most all the story lines too.  Wasted my time cause I thought it would pull things together at the end.,1515024000,,337,4.370967741935484

Watched it halfway and still couldn't get the real point of the movie in anyway significant, or to be relevant, kept looking for a plot, some reason to watch on.  Yes, this should be in the 1 star category",1512864000,,263,4.24
6821786,1,B00PULRRF0,"The terrible ending destroys this movie. If this is about relationships, shouldn't you give us something in the end? A moral to the story?

6821787,3,B00PULRRF0,"As other reviewers noted, it was more about relationship problems than sci-fi.  In fact, I would hardly consider it sci-fi at all.  The couple seemed more like two immature adults squabbling despite having something concrete to be concerned about.  It is confusing and the ending provides some hint of an explanation but not fully.  I don't think the suspense was well executed, the movie dragged (and I don't mind slow movies) but the build up, was not suspenseful.  It was okay just for the fact the ending really brings in a different element/turn but just barely makes it 3 stars.",1512259200,,584,4.8

6821792,2,B00PULRRF0,"Two storylines concerning bickering spouses converge without explanation.

Spoiler Alert:

At first glance, the ending indicates it is all a dream.
On second glance, the ending indicates that there are two converging timelines that converge at the moment the aliens arrive (karma).
On third glance, you can imagine any ending you want, because it is not clear how the storylines should converge  (they converge - but it is clear from many reviews that whatever the foreshadow event that ties things together is not clear - and thus why they converged is missing.)",1511654400,,563,5.0978260869565215

6821820,3,B00PULRRF0,Not a lot of viewers understood that this film is about what the human brain is capable of when near death. This was about how the brain can create a dream reality taking events that actually were experienced and spinning a story. We all dream and our dreams are a mish mash of things we have experienced which get sorted in our dreams and our brains create senarios that are unreal and sometimes weird and scary. Our fears and angst are hugh influences in what makes up the scenarios of our dreams or should I say our nightmares.,1509753600,2,530,4.418367346938775

Enjoyed it, although I don't think anyone looking for a fast-paced thriller will find it in this film. Perhaps that is why so many have given it bad reviews. Acting was just fine, plot unfolded nicely, each element tied into the next, nothing superfluous. I'd recommend this one to lovers of romances, science fiction, and cerebral films.",1508371200,3,455,5.0

I normally only ! star really badly made movie, like the ones with acting so bad, you can only handle 5-30 minutes, and then you just have to quit watching them. The acting in this one is actually pretty good. As a lot of the reviewers said, this is not a sci-fi, as it is led to believe. about half way though it started getting very annoying to me, as I don't care to constantly hear a couple arguing with each other, and there is a lot of that in this movie, a constant loud arguing especially the deeper you get into it.

It's about characters, not so much about the alien invasion, yet the characters aren't too likable; there's an attempt at character depth, but it comes across as they being annoying.  There's a reveal (that is disorienting and confusing at first) towards the end that makes you re-interpret what you've already seen, spelled out for you plainly, and it ruins and makes irrelevant and meaningless one element of the story without improving or adding anything dramatic to the other element of the story.",1503273600,,557,5.043478260869565

6821888,4,B00PULRRF0,"Theres a lot to like about this relationship film set in a sci-fi situation.  A neurotic but likable young couple meet and fall  in love just as news that an asteroid may hit earth in a few years is announced.  Is there any  point in being together?  We intercut to sometime after the asteroid has arrived and  turned out to be a giant alien ship.  Earth is now under siege, with the great majority of people already abducted by the aliens, leaving our couple to survive and try to stay hidden, putting their already tumultuous relationship into a seemingly fatal spin.  All this is fairly strongly acted by Richard J. Danum and Gillian MacGregor.

But then theres the twist ending.  I love a good twist provided it feels fairly set up and makes sense. most of the time.  But this is the rare case where the twist  while fairly grounded - weakened the whole film for me since  at least personally  I thought the story BEFORE the twist was much more compelling and original than the explanation, which seemed a far more familiar idea.",1485993600,,1033,4.543478260869565

The domestic drama is pretty strong here, a bit stressful as something to sit with friends and watch.  It's an extremely personal kind of movie.  That said, it is powerful and communicates beautifully.

In terms of originality...from a technical standpoint, there's nothing mind-blowing about Beyond.  Perhaps the message isn't all that original, either, but you can hear the same thing twenty-thousand times and it won't hit home, and then the right person phrases it just right and it sinks in.

I really came to hate the main character. The twist ending, again very terrestrial in every way possible, was also irritating rather than intriguing.  So, this movie is not as the previews or cover portray, and it's a low-budget, slow, annoying-person-centered movie.

6821922,3,B00PULRRF0,"Yes this seems to have been sold on the premise that it is a sci-fi action drama. Well it is really about a couple Cole and Maya. They meet when an asteroid is a couple of years away from the Earth. The narrative jumps around from the past to the present and can be slightly confusing.

What we have are the ups and downs of these two and the fabric of everyday life being tested. The asteroid which turns out to be some sort of space ship is not really needed. In actual fact it plays only a minor part in this indie film. The acting is all very good but the ending is not only confusing as it will leave a lot of people more than miffed - if that is the big reveal that we were expecting it bears no real surprises.

Anyway the acting really does save this and that is where the strength is in this film. I like indie efforts and I love a bit of sci-fi existentialism, there is a bit of that but not enough to rocket this into cult film status. Currently scraping a 3.2 on IMDb and I can see why but still think it is worth 3 stars.",1428710400,2,1034,3.9663461538461537
6821923,5,B00PULRRF0,"What is wrong with people? Not every Sci-fi films needs giant monsters and explosions or a  Tom Cruise character running around. Good God, what is depicted is  exactly how most of us would behave in the event of the world ending. I think we'd be pretty stressed out. And it isn't that difficult to follow. Come on!  Have we been so indoctrinated by dumbed-down Hollywood films  that we find it tiring to follow something with a plot? This is an ace film and deserves better advertising but since it was  made on the cheap, they probably had nothing left in the kitty.",1428451200,,567,4.519607843137255

6821925,2,B00PULRRF0,"BEYOND begins as a straight drama involving an unemployed laborer who meets and falls in love with a woman who needs the moral structuring that she thinks he can provide. The plot continues into a convenience store holdup in which a clerk is shot. Then inexplicably directors Joseph Baker and Tom Large produce a tectonic shift of focus in much the same way that PREDATOR began as a drug gang jungle shoot'em up but morphed into a hero versus alien confrontation. In BEYOND, we learn that a huge asteroid is on a potential collision course with the earth that will occur in three years. Much of the problem that viewers and reviewers had is that this film does not proceed in a straight line fashion.  The protagonists Cole (Richard J. Danum) and Maya (Gillian MacGregor) fade in and out of the ""now"" and the ""past."" Complicating matters is that toward the final five minutes we see that much of what we thought was a flip flopping temporal dislocation may have been the delirium of Cole who was shot by the clerk who had long blamed him for his own shooting earlier. Maya may or may not be alive to hold Cole's hand during his recovery.  The film hints that the earlier focus on an asteroid collision may have been a cinematic red herring.  Perhaps the huge mass approaching earth was an alien vessel that wiped out most of the earth's population.  The clerk who shot Cole and the doctor who attended to his wounds may or may not be the same person.  It is precisely this may or may not approach that undermines the credibility of a film that had surprisingly solid acting from the leads. BEYOND does not emerge as the terribly annoying trash that so many have called it. In its defense it can be seen as the wanderings of a man who is near death with the vagaries of his memories reflecting and contouring what the viewer sees. Still, it is asking for too much to expect endless viewer patience and attention to floating detail to give BEYOND more than two stars.",1427846400,3,1965,4.523943661971831
6821926,4,B00PULRRF0,"Much better than I was expecting after reading some of these reviews!  This is not a Sci-Fi but is helped along by two very watchable performances from the leads (Danum and MacGregor) - the film is more of a story charting their relationship.  Can certainly see why sci-fi purists might be disappointed but I'd say this is an interesting film, done well, independently on clearly a low budget.  The acting definitely helps to carry it in parts but this is a more subtle and interesting film than most of the paint by numbers stuff out there.",1427760000,,541,4.614583333333333

If you're expecting aliens and space ships you will be disappointed - this is a kitchen sink drama focused on one couple.  The acting here is top-notch, Danum won the award for best actor at the Fantastic Planet Film Festival for his role as Cole and MacGregor is equally strong alongside him.  They work well with a clunky script and their relationship is shown in a dark and honest way.  If you watch knowing that the film is really about one man's struggle against internal and external demons and not about Aliens with lazers you just might enjoy this ... if you want Independence Day you will be left wanting...",1427673600,7,780,4.671532846715328

I've never heard of this actor....but now I did, his acting was impeccable, almost George Clooney-ish kind of mannerism and at times slight gestures. He is a great actor I hope to see him in other movies....Now the movie, I finally caught on, it wasn't an Asteroid....once again....it was an invasion...and Aliens rule the mind and the world.....I thought the movie was well acted, kept me on my feet, left me looking for the signs, and there it was all along. I did not like the ending, I expected a better ending, it kind of leaves one hanging like Uh?....what??? or was it all just a grand illusion from our uninvited guests playing tricks on our minds.....",1427155200,,694,4.69672131147541

Action?  Disappointed!  Storyline? Disappointed!.  But if you love to waste your time, and cherish utter nonsense and boredom, this film is just for you.  This film jumps back and forth with two main characters, and how they cope with an impending asteroid impact, only to find out it's an alien invasion; or is it?  SPOILER ALERT.  Read on, I'm doing you a favor.  The male main character foils a store robbery, but a clerk gets seriously wounded.  In the end of the movie the same pissed off clerk blames the main character and shoots him in a garage parking lot.  How it got from A, the store to W, the garage parking lot doesn't really matter.  The films jumps around too much to even care or keep track.  In the end the main character is dreaming about the alien invasion, and the impending asteroid impact never happens.  The main character ends up in a hospital bed with a gunshot wound.  Still confused?  Well, at least you'll be happy that you didn't have suffer through the complete disaster, as I did.

It's a 'internal character development/psychological' type of movie, and while that might be fine to read in a book, in a movie it's boring to watch.  There are continuous flashforwards and flashbacks with all sorts of crappy metaphors geared towards Cole's life and choices.  It felt like a movie where the director tried to be 'clever' and instead it was clunky and dull.

If you like movies that are all about the internal strife with little outward action, then this movie will be great.  If you like a movie where aliens get blown up, I would give it a hard pass.",1527120000,,664,4.632478632478633
