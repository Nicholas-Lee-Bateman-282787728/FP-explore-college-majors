It is a review of the disc quality ...the disc being manufactured by Vci Entertainment. I had another copy of this film on a dvd from another manufacturer. I had purchased this a few years ago when I was still ignorant of how to search for quality transfers.  That dvd quality was terrible. So, if you want this movie on video buy the Vci Entertainment copy and see how great the quality is compared to some real cheaply made, discount dvds for sale. Also, as previously stated, be aware the blurb on the dvd case is wrong in stating that Robert Sterling plays the mustachioed villain...it is actually Robert Preston who plays that role.",1329004800,4,804,4.544827586206897
696388,1,6303666809,"The Sundowners, 1950 film

This was filmed on ranches near Amarillo and Canyon in the Texas Panhandle. Who killed Juan, a ranch hand? This ranch owner is a newcomer to the area. He is resented because the other ranchers used to graze on his lands. A stranger visits the ranch owner, he learned things in the back room of a saloon. There was an eyewitness to Juan's murder. It wasn't Kid Wichita. At night riders are attacked, they were stealing cattle. A big landowner comes by to complain about the shooting of one of his men (who was riding at night). Taking their saddles away was a costly and deadly insult. Wichita and others visit, we see an authentic small ranch house from that era. Cowboys ride and herd the famous white-faced Hereford cattle famous for their beef.

""Do you know what cartridges cost?"" There are plans for night riding. Wichita hears these plans, then extinguishes the light when he leaves. He next visits Tom Cloud for a conversation. A windmill pumps water for cattle. John Gall visits Tom to ask for his help in straightening out the country. [The conversation seems to drag.] Another man is shot! Kathleen brings Tom's gun back. Tom decides to act. There is a shoot-out between the opposing forces in a canyon. The numbers dwindle. Jeff is wounded, but helps in the battle. Now Tom Cloud will face Wichita to bring him in for Gall's murder. There is a dramatic end to the conflict. The good guy wins. Will there be peace in the valley now?

This is a low budget film that plods through its bad story. A better script makes a better story. It does involve the classic conflicts over business (land and cattle), with personal conflicts.",1296259200,,1664,4.633898305084746
696389,4,6303666809,"Like many Americans, I grew up with westerns, usually seen on the screen of my father's small-town theatre in western Illinois.

Robert Preston chews the scenery as the heavy in this 1950 melodrama, and John Drew Barrymore (or John Barrymore Jr.) makes a token appearance as a kid brother. In HIGH LONESOME, supposedly a sequel to this film, he is the top-listed star.  The Amazon description has Robert Sterling listed as the villain, but, in fact, he is the good guy, while top-billed Preston gets to play the sneaky villain who will even steal his brother's gun to commit a murder. His role is not unlike the one he plays opposite Robert Mitchum in the Robert Wise film noir western BLOOD ON THE MOON. Chill Wills shows us what he looked like at this time, as does the lanky and distinctive Jack Elam, playing against his usual type.

At the beginning of the film (remember when film credits were shown at the beginning of a film instead of at the end when the audience is walking out or ejecting the DVD at home?) we are told where the film was photographed, and the appropriate ranchers are thanked for the privilege of allowing the production to be made on their property. Interesting.  Informative.

What is equally interesting is being able to see a film on DVD in near pristine quality, thanks to the Technicolor original that has survived since 1950. One almost feels as if he or she is somehow back there, visiting the set by way of a time machine. Since that approximate time, however, we have been forced to watch films lensed in Ansco-color (Metrocolor), Eastmancolor, Warnercolor, DeLuxe Color, Movielab color, Trucolor, and other two-strip variations. Maybe this is why only black-and-white films still look good after all these years, unless, of course, a three-strip negative happened to be stored away in a vault. I suppose it is too much to ask that we return to the days of Technicolor, even with the services of a Technicolor consultant on the scene; I guess that privilege is only reserved for certain Chinese filmmakers. For a while, only Paramount held onto Technicolor, producing some of the most beautiful color motion pictures shown on the big screen.

Except for seeing some of our supporting characters in earlier roles, nothing is particularly remarkable about THE SUNDOWNERS, not to be confused with the Robert Mitchum film set in Australia. It is a standard western that reveals little about life in 19th century America. It is not as much fun as watching such multi-starred frontier dramas as WARLOCK or THE BIG COUNTRY or GUNFIGHT AT THE OK CORRAL. Those films had something to say about morality in the west, or, like 3:1O TO YUMA, offered a psychological examination of the people who often made their own laws in a lawless time and place. THE SUNDOWNERS is what might be referred to as a matinee western, a B-western programmer. People argue, they shoot each other, and good triumphs over evil. Okay. Good moral lesson, but nothing unusual or striking here. Just a good color transfer that makes one long for Technicolor.

So set your time machine, with its nostalgia button installed, for another trip down memory lane. It will remind you of a time when movies were made by actors and actresses how knew their craft and gave good performances for your matinee dollar -- or yuan -- not ex-sports stars or rock singers or news-occupying, no-talent celebrities.

Maybe this is just another western, but if you like solid westerns that provided solid entertainment, check out THE SUNDOWNERS (1950).",1249344000,8,3533,4.84742951907131
696390,5,6303666809,"THE SUNDOWMERS (1950) was a Alan LeMay/Templeton production, via Eagle-Lion, which competed briefly with some of the larger releasing studios in the later 1940's early '50s. Until VCI's release I'd never seen a good print of it, either on VHS or DVD. The VCI technicolor print is very good, and purchasers will not be disappointed. The film boasts stellar performances by an underrated Robert Preston and, in a sometimes comic role, Chill Wills. Robert Sterling is fine as well, but Preston steals the show. A young John Barrymore, Jr., plays the younger brother to Sterling and Preston. Eagle-Lion followed THE SUNDOWNERS with a sequel, HIGH LONESOME, starring Barrymore....it's an okay film [VCI has it out as well, in another fine technicolor print], although Barrymore lacks the panache of a Preston. Still, at the inexpensive price asked, worthwhile investigating....

As an earlier reviewer commented, the liner notes mix up Preston and Sterling, but this should in no way deter you from purchasing THE SUNDOWNERS, an enjoyable film and very welcome. Extras include cast bio's and scene selections. Our thanks to the adventuresome folks at VCI who contine to do great work in releasing good prints of some B (and A) level Westerns, classic horror, film noir, adventure films, and serials!",1156118400,14,1294,5.1913875598086126
696391,3,6303666809,"VCI should check their marketing notes before release. We are informed on the back cover that Robert Preston is the hero and Robert Sterling is the villain, this is completely wrong. Try the other way about. Also their description of the story line is inaccurate. For the most part the transfer from a technicolor print is very good to excellent. The sound is always audible but has some distortion at times. Enjoyable western with all players in good to top form, the only let down is the direction which lacks cohesion. Over all I was pleased with my purchase, and a good copy on dvd is rare.",1126396800,9,594,4.5607476635514015
696392,3,6303666809,"They say that you get what you pay for and in this bargain price DVD you get two pretty good public domain westerns from the early 1950s, a couple of cartoons and several vintage TV commerials, mostly for children's toys. In all a pretty entertaining package, but greatly marred by a general lack of care in presentation. The print of The Sundowners is especially poor, with washed out color, deep emulsion scratches and missing frames- too bad, it's a pretty good movie with a great performance by Robert Preston as the villian/antihero.  The source print for Vengence Valley, a glossy M-G-M release starring Burt Lancaster, is much better, but the presentation is marred by poor mastering which causes the picture to appear fuzzy throughout.",1105488000,7,743,4.991935483870968

7852118,5,6303666809,"RELEASED IN 1950 and directed by George Templeton, ""The Sundowners"" is a Western taking place in the Texas panhandle where honest rancher Tom Cloud (Robert Sterling) and his teenage brother (John Drew Barrymore) are having a difficult time with dubious Sheriff Elmer Gall (Don Haggerty) and some rustlers. When supposed outlaw Kid Wichita (Robert Preston) comes back to town, however, he starts cleaning up the county, which earns the ire of the sheriff and the rustlers. Chill Wills plays a kindly neighbor while John Litel appears as the sheriffs father, whos (apparently) unaware of his sons questionable activities.

NOTE: This shouldnt be confused with the 1960 movie of the same name about Australian sheep drovers starring Robert Mitchum and Deborah Kerr.

While The Sundowners is a small, obscure Western, its one of my favorites because of its interesting characters, engaging writing and palpable realism. As far as the latter goes, it was actually shot in the Texas panhandle, rather than Arizona or Southern Cal like too many old Westerns.

Someone criticized the movie on the grounds that he had a hard time figuring who was good and who was bad, which illustrates another element of realism: The characters have shades of grey rather than being wholly black or white. Even the main protagonist, Tom Cloud, who represents wisdom and goodness, reveals an imprudent side, which Im not going to give away.  Of course the people involved in the rustling ring are definitely shady, albeit secretly. The father of the ringleader, however, isn't corrupt and didn't know what his son was doing, although he might have suspected and turned a blind eye.

Kid Wichita, however, is somewhere in between black and white, mainly due to his dubious past and the leery way Tom regards his return. Wichita amusingly says a few times: ""From Amarillo to Gee Whit, nobody never proved a thing on me  'cept twice,"" which means he committed at least two actual crimes in the past and obviously more.

In the current events of the movie, though, I didn't see Wichita do anything wrong. All he does is help rid the county of a rustling ring. There are several references to Wichita murdering someone but, actually, he caught the individual scheming and didn't shoot until the guy went for his gun. That's not murder; it's self-defense. The same thing happens in another situation. Personally, I was all for Wichita cleaning up the county of the rustling trash. Maybe Wichita deserves to die for his past sins, but not for anything he does in this movie.

Kid Wichita, by the way, is an excellent example of a classic antihero before antiheroes came into vogue with Leones (overrated) spaghetti Westerns in the mid-60s. Wichita is a bold gunslinger who oozes confidence and la Joie de vivre (French for the joy of living), not to mention recognizes and fearlessly confronts true corruption (evil), which is usually hidden. The boy (Barrymore) naturally starts to look up to Wichita and emulates him. This brings to mind the best succinct line: Why sure!

Jack Elam is featured in a peripheral role as an unloving husband in one of his first films at the age of 29 (during shooting). Most people understandably view Elam as a likable human-looking gargoyle so its interesting to see him as a relatively good-looking young man. On the female front Cathy Downs (the titular character in 1946 My Darling Clementine) has a pretty meaty part as Elams hot redhead wife, who naturally looks for romance elsewhere.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 23 minutes and was shot in the Texas panhandle (Palo Duro Canyon State Park and ranches near Canyon, Stinnett and Amarillo) with studio work done at Universal Studios, CA. WRITER: Alan LeMay.

7852125,4,6303666809,"This film has become, along with ""The Furies"", among my favorite pre-1960 western films. It's a real gem that deserves a wider audience today. Robert Preston is superb as a charismatic good-guy-at-heart with a fatal flaw--an attraction to the dark side. A very young Lionel Drew Barrymore (Drew Barrymore's father) appears as the young kid in search of a brotherly hero figure. (He looks like one of the Penn brothers; certainly a far superior actor to those dissolute wise guys.) But the rock-solid star of the show is its Texas panhandle location--the beautiful Palo Duro Canyon of Texas, with its signature ""Lighthouse"" rock formation dominating the landscape, makes a stunning backdrop to the drama. I especially appreciate movies that are shot on the actual location in which they are supposed to take place (not shot in Mexico or Canada locales, substituting for the real, majestic American west, in order to line the pockets of the studio execs and spoiled actors or exploit workers at low wages).  On those dreary winter weekend days when I need to escape, this film gets more ""gunplay"" on my TV screen than most other westerns. (Remember, there's an equally fine Aussie outback film of the same title, starring Robert Mitchum, so don't get the two confused.)",1366588800,,1267,5.004739336492891
