661799,3,630346470X,"Although the film deviates from the original novel quite a bit, it's still a worthwhile watch. The music is good and even though the plot is changed, it's still cute. There are a few things that require quite a suspension of disbelief, and parts of the plot rather irked me, like the Phantom's nemisis getting away with stealing his music in the end, and that I was never sure whether he really loves Christine, or just wants to tutor her. Still, the movie does have it's good points, and for those who like the gorey horror movies there is a bit of blood in there.",995241600,3,565,4.390476190476191
661800,4,630346470X,"I spent years being caught up in articles about the different versions of Phantom of the Opera in Famous Monsters and other magazines during the 1970s. At the time, there were only three versions. There are now 10 versions. (After writing my review for the 1925 DVD, I stumbled on another version.) I'm not including musicals. There have been 8 live action and 2 animated movies. There are also 3 different musicals I know of - Ken Hill, Andrew Lloyd-Webber, and Maury Yeston. I think there might be a 4th musical version, but I can't confirm that yet.
The 1962 verion with Herbert Lom and Heather Sears was the first version I ever saw. It was a midnight broadcast on my local ABC station around 1980, and I taped it. That TV broadcast had the subplot with Liam Redmond as one of the detectives investigating the strange happenings at the Opera House.
Redmond is incorrectly listed in the cast for this tape. He does not appear on this edition. It does not have the subplot Maltin mentions in his review. To me, that kinda makes the tape incomplete for me because I know scenes are missing. However, the subplot is not necessary for the storyline. If you never saw the other version, you aren't missing much.
The movie is not very loyal to the original Leroux novel, but it is still an enjoyable horror movie. The Phantom is not in love with Christine here, but he does have a professional interest in her. He feels she is the only one who can do justice to his opera. The story was moved from France to England which is a nice touch for the approach Hammer chose to take with this version. The streets of London during this time period add a nice touch to the overall feel of the movie that I have trouble imagining Paris doing. The English setting provides a touch of mystery and horror. It's the same streets you might see Jack the Ripper. (Jack the Ripper was mentioned in the subplot by a detective.)
Hammer has made many great horror films, and this version of The Phantom of the Opera is up there. I wish they had stuck more closely to the original story or at least kept the basic elements like the love story. It's still an enjoyable Hammer Horror movie.
For those interested in trivia, this movie has Michael Gough who has been seen more recently as Alfred in the Batman movies. Take a close look at the ratcatcher too. Patrick Troughton should be familiar to Doctor Who fans. He played the second Doctor during the late 1960s and also appeared in the movie, The Omen.",995155200,7,2479,4.498891352549889
661801,5,630346470X,"This film takes place in the 1700s in a London opera house.  It is a more gothic version and contains a great original opera ""Joan of Arc"" sung/played in minor chord.  Made by the low budget film company Hammer films, this film came out stunnungly well. Though this film strays from Gaston Leroux's original novel and is more of a remake of the 1943 film version, this film makes excellent usage of color, music, costumes, sets, has great actors, and an excellent script. This film satisfies most audiences, but the sad ending sometimes leaves first time viewers feeling a little depressed.  It has drama, romance, terror, mystery, action, suspence, and some great plot twists. The great thing about this film is that it gets better with each viewing. It includes the original theatrical trailer (before the film) which spoiles most of the film's climactic scenes, so if you what to be in for a really great treat, fast forward through the trailer (watch it later) and watch the film at night in the dark.",975369600,6,1005,4.764367816091954
661802,4,630346470X,"I suppose most ""purists"" consider earlier versions starring Lon Chaney and Claude Rains, respectfully, as being the best of this oft-interpreted story.  I, for one, have fond memories of this Hammer  adaptation starring Herbert Lom, the hapless police commissioner in  ""The Pink Panther"" series.
His ""phantom"" is  sympathetic, forceful, and completely mesmerizing.  The actor has a voice  that commands attention.  It is amazing to me that his career was not more  remarkable that it was.
The music, especially the last aria  ""sung"" by ""Christine,"" is superb.  Obviously, Hammer  felt that that element deserved a full treatment so they sparred no expense  in that area.
Terence Fisher has crafted a wonderful film that ranks as  one of the studio's better adaptations of classic literature.
Michael  Gough, late as ""Alfred"" in the ""Batman"" series, plays  Lord D'Ambrose Darcy with such complete arrogance and deceit that you  cringe every time he is on screen.  No one else could have played such an  unlikeable character.
Let this Phantom cast his spell over you!",957830400,31,1065,5.201183431952662
661803,4,630346470X,"Hammer's version of the Phantom starts right in with odd happenings at the opera like missing music, destroyed instruments and stories of ghosts.  On opening night of the opera (which is about Joan of Arc) a man is hanged and  the star singer leaves because of it. The opera's producer and the house  manager try to find a replacement and deal with the opera's obnoxious  creator who tries to control every step of the opera. A young women named  Christine is picked for the starring role, but the Phantom hears her and  takes her away to his underground lair.  This is the finest version of  the Phantom because the Chaney version offers a strong performance for the  phantom, but the story strays and becomes very awkward at times. The  Universal version offers a fine phantom played by Claude Rains, but gets  bogged down by too much singing and it takes the film nearly half an hour  to really get going.  This version jumps right into the story and never  slows down, the interest level is high throughout the film and the the pace  is consistent. Herbert Lom offers a more low key, almost sympathetic  phantom. Michel Gough deserves mention for a great job as the overbearing  Lord Ambrose D'Arcy. The Phantom did not really need an assistant and he  never professes his love for Christine as much as he does just for the  musical ability she has. This is still a fine film for Hammer and the best  Phantom to date.",950659200,22,1421,4.585657370517929
661804,4,630346470X,"Like the 1990 version of the Phantom movie starring Charles Dance as my beloved Erik, I got quite a few guilty pleasures out of this particular version of the movie.
Yes, just like most of the other movies on the  Phantom, this one took extreme liberties with the story.  Don't look to  this one for technical and/or ""historical accuracy.""  (ie-it's  not much like Leroux's story).
However, the SPIRIT of what makes Erik so  appealing is kept intact.  I never viewed Erik as a sinister man, and so  the sympathetic portrayal is well appreciated by this viewer.
According  to the novels I have read on Erik, he is a tough, workaholic Maestro.  However, he also has a side to him that is big-hearted and passionate  enough to put his own personal safety on the line.  This side of Erik which  I find appealing is all kept intact.
If you are looking for a movie that  remains loyal to Leroux's novel, this one is not for you.  If you just want  to sit back, relax, and enjoy a good gothic horror/romance movie, this one  is a good choice to consider.",943660800,6,1047,4.48404255319149
661805,1,630346470X,"I do not recommed this at all for someone who wants some truth to the story line. It's a good movie, in the Hammer House style. But, as a Phantom movie, it's just horrible. The only good part in the movie is where the  phantom is playing Bachs Toccata and Fuge in D minor on the organ. Of all  the phantom movies I've seen, that's one of the best senes. But, over all  it was a terrible movie.",943401600,2,393,4.012820512820513

661926,4,630346470X,"I have my issues with this version of Phantom, but I am more pleased than displeased. Of course changing the Phantom's history and identity rankles, but the choices made make sense to the rest of the story line and I can let that go. I think if you disregard the book entirely, Hammer makes a solid film.

The music was lovely and Lom was spot on as our scarred, tortured genius. He simply had a strong, commanding presence. So much so that I wish he had more screen time and there was more relationship development between him and Christine. Not necessarily a romantic relationship (though I do admit a happy ending for the Phantom is always on my wish list), but something that grows mutual respect and admiration. Given the movie's time constraints, I can see why this was not developed further.

This is a nice addition to any PotO collector's video library, so I would definitely recommend picking it up. It's up there in my top 5 Phantom films.",1476144000,2,950,4.58235294117647

662000,5,630346470X,"Even though the movie itself is kind of cheesy and the acting so so, this is by far the best music in any of the PotO movies.  The Joan of Arc opera itself, by Edwin Astley, is featured a great deal in the movie, and the plotline seems secondary.  I bought it since the local stations always edit the movie to only show a short clip of the aria in the last segment of the movie - this is pretty much what I watch it for.",1457913600,,420,3.872093023255814
662001,4,630346470X,"I was very impressed with this when I first heard it, mostly because the music of the ""opera"" was so striking.  I purchased it mainly for that reason.  I almost wish the opera really existed, extant.  The scenes from it are effectively staged, especially at the end when Joan goes to her death.  Otherwise it is a pretty mild, inoffensive, not particularly scary or dramatic version of the story.

662115,4,630346470X,"...has a lot going for it, if you are willing to take it on its own terms. Like Gaston Leroux's original novel, the 1943 film with Claude Rains, and the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, this version emphasises the tragic love story angle not the horror one. It should be noted that the original Lon Chaney version had the Phantom dying of a broken heart (stills of this ending exist) before preview audiences saw him as a monster and insisted on a more dramatic ending. It's thanks to Chaney and Universal that the Phantom came to be thought of as an evil character rather than a tragic one. However since this was being produced by Hammer Films whose name had now become synonymous with horror, people expected more and still do.

A little background history (courtesy of Hammer Films authority Marcus Hearn) explains a lot. The script was written with Cary Grant in mind (he approached Hammer and had expressed an interest in being in one of their movies) and thus the dwarf character was created to do the murders (Cary Grant wouldn't kill people in cold blood). With Grant supposedly on board, the Phantom was intended to be much more sympathetic, a character more sinned against then sinning hence the backstory of having his music stolen. Once Grant went on his merry way after not signing a contract, this approach was still retained and the role was given to 45 year old Herbert Lom who was 2 years away from Inspector Dreyfus in the PINK PANTHER films.

Director Terence Fisher wanted the emphasis to be on the music as well as the characters and that emphasis is quite clear in the finished film. This called for more elaborate staging and more people to be involved and so the cost grew. The BBFC (British Board of Film Censors) then insisted on a number of cuts and when released, the film was poorly received in England and wound up losing big money. This failure caused Fisher to be unofficially ""retired"" and he wouldn't make another Hammer film for 2 years after directing 12 Gothics for them in the previous 5 years. That film would be THE GORGON and would restore him to the studio's good graces but he essentially never recovered and would make only 6 films during the next 12 years. Now on to the film itself.

PHANTOM is gorgeous to look at and is full of Fisher's masterful use of color and light. It also features his enhanced narrative editing style and sophisticated moving camerawork. In addition to Lom, who is superb, Heather Sears is a wonderfully naive Christine while Eduard De Souza's Harry (not Raoul) is charming and engaging. It's also good to see Hammer regular Thorley Walters not doing his usual befuuddled old man routine. After Lom, the top prize goes to Michael Gough as the thoroughly detestable Lord Ambrose D'Arcy. He's so vile that you want to open a window as soon as he's offscreen. So forget the horror, enjoy the music and the settings, and let the Phantom's tragic tale envelop you. If you do that, you'll find that there is much here to admire.",1407024000,,2991,4.650283553875236
662116,5,630346470X,This is perhaps the best known of the older version with Herbert Lom as the phantom and the organ music of Bach.  You get the whole range of emotions with this phantom. It is my personal favorite of the 8 versions I own.,1403395200,,220,4.116279069767442

I am used to buying bargain DVDs out of the wire bins and even the 10 packs for 5 bucks look better to me than this copy.  I think they need to recheck the quality settings when making their dvds.  The movie itself is okay.  But it is not up to the magnificence of the stage play or the Lon Chaney version.  The chandelier is really small and lame--looks like they bought it at goodwill.  I am a fan of Peter Cushing, Terence Fisher and Hammer films, in general, but this dvd/film combo strikes out with me.",1394323200,,658,4.344262295081967
662120,3,630346470X,"This DVD helped me to understand what attracts phans to Phantom of the Opera.  People are different and some focus on the horror aspect, the romantic story, the powerful connection with music, or the literary twists and turns of Leroux's novel.  Aside from the fact that this film was made in 1962 (we are spoiled today. with special effects and high definition), it was interesting to see another, if dated, interpertation of POTO.  This one would really appeal to classic gothic horror interests.",1392940800,,498,4.975903614457831
662121,5,630346470X,"By far, the best version of Gaston Leroux's novel, although some elements of the original story have been changed, i.e., Leroux's Phantom haunts the l'Opera Garnier in Paris (not a theatre in London), the central female character, Christine, is Swedish in the original novel, not a Londonite, Christine's love interest is a French viscount, not a theatre producer, and Christine is kidnapped by the Phantom himself in the French original novel, not by the Phantom's dwarfish hunchback mute as in this film.  Still, the clarity of sadness of an unsuccessful love triangle as in the novel comes through extremely well in this film version.  Additionally, no one can doubt the incredible impact of the musical score and Christine's singing throughout the film (although I am not certain Heather Sears' Christine did the actual singing).  I based strongly my jaw-dropping, primarily hand-made 2013 Hallowe'en costume on Herbert Lom's Phantom w/ a few dramatic variations, changing the cape to a snow-white one w/ deep purple lining, white formal parade gloves, all-black clothes under the cape and real, turn-of-the-century button-down white spatterdashes (spats) around my shoes.  Mr. Lom would have been flattered, I'm sure.  One last note:  the impeccable Michael Gough makes a fantastic vile and vicious (Herbert Lom's Phantom's words) Lord Ambrose d'Arcy, the opera house general manager and pseudo-composer, in this film version.  In recent past, I found Michael Gough also playing parts in several other Hammer Studios films and even in one or two of Rod Serling's early Twilight Zone episodes.  Mr. Gough's sinister, remorseless, apathetic persona as Lord d'Arcy often surpasses that of Mr. Lom's Phantom in some scenes, esp. in his not-so-subtle lust for the film's heroine.

Hammer's version of The Phantom Of The Opera (1962) doesn't stay true to the original story.  Changes were made, including even the location where the story takes place.  That's OK with me, because Hammer did a great job with this film, anyway.  Everything in this movie works -- the London setting, the color, the costumes, the atmosphere, and the lavish sets.  The movie also has good music and the singing is good as well.  The acting is good and Hammer regular Michael Gough appears in top form.

Overall, this is an enjoyable version of The Phantom Of The Opera that I highly recommend.",1353542400,,696,4.694214876033058

the dvd of this goes straight to movie without no comericals for other movies before the flim starts.

Note:i've completed my collection of phantom of opera flims with Maximillian Schell & Jane Seymour(buy the movie at amazon.uk).i will not buy the phantom of paradise because it sucks & worst of apdaptation of phantom ever!!!!!!

662269,5,630346470X,"I had nightmares after seeing 1962's Hammer/Universal version of ""Phantom of the Opera.""  It was the organ music especially that caused me what had become a claustrophobic feeling in the nightmares.  (Roger Corman's ""The Premature Burial"" and Alfred Hitchcock's ""The Birds"" were the other two films to cause nightmares).  But Hammer's film which thankfully did not star Cary Grant (who is touted to have been considered for the part) in the Edward de Souza role was especially noteworthy as it was a Hammer film tailored for kids of the G-rating variety.  I was a kid then but they let me in to see a disturbing film like ""The Birds"" with no question.  Despite critics who found the film straying drastically from the classic original, it is the most satisfying entertainment-wise except the villain does not significantly get his just desserts all too apparently, but then the main characters investigate the truth of the matter so thoroughly during the course of the film that one can be certain they will set the matter straight.  Herbert Lom has one of his best roles here as the sympathetic Phantom, perhaps the film's greatest asset, the portrayal of the Phantom in Lom's performance and the script by Hammer's John Elder.  The film was directed by Terence Fisher, the prolific director of a vast amount of Hammer's successes, and in my opinion, is at the top of his craft here.  De Souza as the hero and Michael Gough as the villain are commanding and Heather Sears is a very good ""Christine.""  Everything about Hammer's version succeeds in making the film memorable.  Universal, which had presented this film as part of their Hammer Horror Series, which froze and locked on my DVD players upon a second viewing as this discs degraded, had provided a beautiful transfer as were all of the films in the set.  This Universal Vault Series edition (which had previously produced a very faulty edition of Curtis Harrington's 1967 ""Games"" wherein all copies should have been recalled for a speeding up of the last ten minutes which took them months to correct and causing me to be stuck with a defective product that I have to overlook every time I watch it) is not as good a transfer.  Universal has become the most notoriously shameless studio going.",1331251200,,2253,4.838541666666667
662270,4,630346470X,"""Phantom of the Opera"" has long been considered one of Hammer Films' least efforts.  It failed at the box office in 1962, which led the company to exile director Terence Fisher for a certain period of time.  What's more, when it turned up on American television in the 1970s, it contained extraneous scenes shot for TV airing that had nothing to do with the story, and which weighed it down further.  But seen in its original form, and original format, this ""Phantom"" is quite good.  While it takes liberties with the original Leroux book, it stands on its own feet.  This version is set in London instead of Paris, and the Phantom is not a deformed-from-birth insane genius, but rather a sympathetic composer whose work is stolen by a dastardly nobleman.  In trying to destroy the evidence of the theft, the composer (Herbert Lom) has his face severely burnt, and becomes the mad Phantom, living under the opera house with an insane dwarf servant.  Heather Sears plays the young ingenue, who is kidnapped by the Phantom and taught to sing, and who ultimately becomes the star of the opera, while Edward de Souza is the director of the opera, who is torn between putting on a good show, and catering to the egomaniacal demands of Lord D'Arcy (Michael Gough, at his most uninhibited), the dastardly nobleman who stole the opera.  Gough is a great villain, but he never sticks around to get his just deserts.  De Souza is adequate (in a role originally envisioned for Cary Grant!), but Sears, as Christine, is lovely, and even lip-synchs the operatic sequences effectively.  Unfortunately, the opera sequences work against the film.  There is too much of it, and the music is for the most part lousy.  The exception to this is the film (and opera's) end, in which Sears, as Christine, playing Joan of Arc, sings an aria that the Phantom composed.  This sequence is beautifully filmed, and the music, as well as the performances of Sears and Lom, combine to create a moving experience the likes of which Hammer never before or after achieved.  Anyone who is not affected by the sight of Lom shedding a tear under his mask for his music is colder than Dracula.  All in all, this is a worthwhile film, though ""Phantom"" purists might be left wanting.",1325980800,2,2244,4.717948717948718

The arias were outstanding and the musical highlight was the rendition of Tocatta und Fugue near the middle. However there were various inadequacies that stood out at me. Firstly there is a complete absence of affection between Christine and the ""Phantom"". Secondly, the moviemakers failed to punish Ambrose D'arcy for his actions. You would think that they would do something terrible to that sivelling slimey bastard. You want to attack him the moment you see him, but then again that is Michael Gough at his disgusting best. Lastly, Why does the Phantom rip off his mask before jumping from the box to the stage to save Christine. Does he think he will be more areodynamic without it? Regardless of all this the movie had a gripping plotline and I was gripped throughout. I would highly recomend this movie.",1195689600,2,985,4.5083798882681565
662382,3,630346470X,"This Phantom of the Opera has a somewhat interesting plot that resembles the 1943 film witout any new twists except maybe the new names.
The setting is in Victorian London in the Opera House run by Lord Ambrose D'Arcy(Michael Gough). Years earlier, an unpublished composer came to Lord D'Arcy and asked him to publish his music. The composer names' was Professor Petire(Lom), but D'Arcy published the music with his name on it. Infurgiated, Petire tries to destroy all the prints and tablets made for printing, but in the process Petire is disfigured by nitiric acid. He is taken by a dwarf down into the sewers beneth the opera house. Years later, Petrie's eye is caught by the young singer named Christine Charles(Heather Sears) he wants to teach her to sing his music for him alone. Other than that, Christine's only romantic intetrest is Harry Hunter(Edward de Souza) the opera' producer and the investiagtor of Petire's past.
This is basically a mystery with opera the plot doesn't even remseble the novel except for the disfigurement, but that occured at birth in Leroux's original tale. This movie does have some high points, but they are few and far between like the use of the Joan of Arc opera and the addition of Beetheen's Sym. 9. The plot leaves much to be desired. It was confusing to me at first where the plot was set, but it seems no one can come right out and say that it is in London. This is simply eye candy with very little thought. This movie should have been a mystery and no horror in the title. There are a few tense movements, but very few. Do yourself a favor and find another phantom movie this one is only eye candy, but it is beaituful with some superb acting from our British counterparts espeically from Lom and Gough, but if you are looking for Leroux you won't find him in this verison .",1184371200,,1822,4.5920245398773005

662384,5,630346470X,"*** SPOILERS ***

This 1962 Hammer Films' Herbert Lom version of The Phantom of the Opera still speaks to me more than all the other versions, even though it is far different from the Gaston Leroux story, and likewise different from the Webber musical.  Some of the reasons the Hammer Film works for me more than the others are the cast, the foggy London atmosphere, the art direction and above all, the score by Edwin Astley.  It made perfect sense to have the opera within the story be based on Joan of Arc rather than Don Juan which we see in some of the other versions.  Joan of Arc, like the Phantom in this version, was consumed by fire, and Christine (exquisitely played by Heather Sears), like Joan, hears voices instructing her.  Joan hears the voice of God and Christine hears the phantom, (Professor Petrie in this version) who instructs her that if she listens to him her singing will be greater than the greatest.

As many know, the real villian in this version is Lord Ambrose D'Arcy, performed with relish by Hammer regular Michael Gough.  He's truly sleezy and arrogant and the scene at a fancy restaurant where he attempts to coerce Christine to get her to come to his apartment for ""training"" is classic Hammer.  There are a few good scares in the film, but the violence in this version is not assigned to the phantom, but to a mute dwarf character who seems to be the phantom's protector and confidant.  I know many Hammer fans dislike this aspect of the story, but I always felt the idea believable and correct.  It gave the catacombs/sewers sequences an added sense of realism.

As the love interest / the director of the opera, Edward de Souza couldn't have been a better choice.  Class and charm all the way, his scenes with Heather Sears - particularly the night coach ride - have a romantic chemistry that few Hammer films equal.  Herbert Lom, who plays the Professor Petrie / Phantom character is really a fine actor, and although I've read that he didn't enjoy working with Hammer, his performance is one of the best things about the film.  His voice has a deep resonance that fills one with dread while suggesting intelligence and compassion at the same time.  And that one-eyed mask he wears!  Simple and horrific - really scarier than the scarred face beneath.

Astley's score is probably the best ever to come out of Hammer, and it's a shame it's unavailable as a soundtrack release.  It's full-blown and memorable, complete with a Joan of Arc opera the composer wrote just for the film.  Joan's Aria at the story's cllimax with Petrie watching from Box 5,  is one of the great moments in Hammer history.

This film was released in a so-so laserdisc version years ago, but it needs to be remastered for DVD in the letterbox format.  The aspect ratio is probably 1 to 1.66, so the letterbox would be slight, but it makes a difference, particularly with the opera sequences.  And the audio really needs to be cleaned up - the laserdisc was atrociously noisy.  This is not a film for those who are hung up with the Webber musical (which I also like).  If that's what you expect going into this, you'll be disappointed, but if you understand what Hammer Films were trying to achieve within their limited budgets, you might really enjoy this moody version of the story.",1097884800,7,3295,4.629948364888124
662385,5,630346470X,"I've seen all of them from the original with organ backgroud music to the latest Hollywood attempt.  This version to me was the best. There seems to be alot of character development where all the others just want to see who can create more violence.  We have to remember in alot of ways that this is really a love story of music and a opera.  This version with its, i think, original music is wonderful. I have always wished that there was a recording of this somewhere because the music is extremely powerful, climatic and strong.  The acting is the best you'll see on the screen in years the voice of Christine is magical. Wish this version would come out on DVD.  I'm just wondering how the musical version will hold up seeing that there isn't any talent in Hollywood these days. I hope Andrew Loyd Webber has the good sence to do this film right and stay away from American Movie actors.  I hope that his new movie attempt of stars come from the stage.

662386,3,630346470X,"Hammer regular Terence Fisher gives Phantom of the Opera a good shot, but it is not enough. The result is perhaps his most uneven film. Chief problem is that, although it seems Fisher wanted a sympathetic protagonist, the Phantom (Herbert Lom) comes across as rather a brute, and fails to inspire the necessary pity or sympathy. The way he manhandles and slaps around the heroine (Christine, played by Heather Sears) is fatal to this, and not helped by the plot's general lack of believability and the Phantom's insufficient motivations.

This is not to say there are not plenty of great vintage Fisher/Hammer touches. The suspense is built up effectively at times; unfortunately, as with the earlier 1943 adaptation, the lengthy and rather banal operatic sequences tend to defuse the tension.

Certainly worth a look, but on the whole, this was a bit of a misfire. Despite some fantastic set-pieces (including the impressive Bernard-Robinson-designed underground lair) and an at-times genuinely sinister Phantom, it lacks punch.",1089072000,,1029,5.2682926829268295

For me, one of the most important aspects of the original story is the great and neverending love of Erik for Christine. In this film, there's NO love - the Phantom only wants somebody who can present his music perfectly to the world.
In this film, Erik never kills anyone, he has an odd-jobber for the dirty jobs. Besides the real Erik would NEVER!! beat Christine! So the Phantom in this film and Leroux's Erik are two completely different characters.

This was the third Phantom of the Opera movie and the first one made in the United Kingdom. This one has a different twist then the other two. In the first two the Phantom worked solo and in this one he as an assistant who unknowingly or knowingly does his dirty work for him. The one follows closely to the 1943 Claude Rains version. The main difference is Claude Rains was a violinist and Herbert Lom is voice trainer. Professor Petrie takes is unpublished music to Lord Ambrose D'Arcy in the hopes that he would publish his music. Instead Lord Ambrose D'Arcy publish the music under his own name and when Professor Petrie finds out he goes to the printing place to destroy the printing plates and all the printed music. However a fire erupts and in his attempts to put out the fire he accidently throw nitric acid on the fire and some of it splashes back on his face and he runs out screaming and falls into the river where a dwarf saves him. Now of the three Phantoms this one has the most horrific face even though it is shown very briefly at the end of the movie. Even his hands looks badly burned. Though with this one you feel the most sorrow for. The first two Phantoms wanted Christine all to themselves whereas this Phantom wanted to help her become a better opera singer to perform in his play. Even when he dies at the end of the movie saving Christine you still feel remorseful about the guy. This Phantom of the Opera gets an AAAA++++.
