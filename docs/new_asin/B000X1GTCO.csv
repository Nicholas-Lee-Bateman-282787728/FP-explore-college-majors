2995915,5,B000X1GTCO,"My husband and I are really enjoying Dance Lessons 101.  We were looking for a way to get some exercise and enjoy each other's company after our son goes to bed.  This DVD has been perfect.  It was so interesting that even after 12 years of marriage the dance lessons gave us that awkward but fun experience you have when you first date someone.  We were forced to be aware of our personal space and the shared space between us.  We laughed about the way we were trying to get our bodies to move, and about each other's awkwardness.  This DVD has given us an opportunity to reconnect and take time for each other in the comfort of our home.  This video is paced well and is easy to understand.  I love the variety of dances we are learning and feel certain we will be purchasing more Shawn Trautman DVDs in the future.  Finally, I really appreciate that Shawn and his wife come across as ""down to earth"" people.  Obviously they know how to dance and both have great skill, but they make it appear attainable for the average couple.  Thank you so much.",1207180800,33,1051,4.365979381443299
2995916,5,B000X1GTCO,"We had just taken a beginners dance class in a studio, and wanted something to practice with.  We thought the DVD was great.  It was at the right pace and level of instruction for beginners.",1205539200,16,190,4.4
2995917,3,B000X1GTCO,"Good for beginners. Really basic dance steps, he keeps pluging other videos by him on specific dances. It feels little like sample dance lession.",1205193600,7,145,5.083333333333333
2995918,5,B000X1GTCO,"This DVD isn't intimidating, and it basically puts a world-renowned dance teacher in your living room.  I actually think it's better than an in-person lesson because you're able to see the steps from every angle.  By the end of the lesson, I was so excited that I had learned the steps - it's almost as if I internalized them.",1201478400,63,326,4.508474576271187
2995919,5,B000X1GTCO,"Nicely done, - for beginners you'll learn the basic step of each dance, Shawn & his partner break down the step into its parts in a easy-to-follow format - for advanced beginners, it's a good refresher DVD.
I'm a single male with 1 year's ballroom & Latin lessons under my belt. I use the DVD for practice without a partner before going out to dance.",1200787200,84,350,4.4

2995921,4,B000X1GTCO,"This DVD is very good for getting the basics down.  It would be good to have a little more practice for each of the steps.  For example, having an entire song's worth of time after teaching the lesson would be a great improvement.  However, since my wife and I are beginners, it's otherwise great for us.",1484784000,2,304,4.392857142857143

2995927,5,B000X1GTCO,"...we have started to travel and what we danced in younger years is no longer ""in"". so we ordered this CD. We like the way Mr & Mrs Trautman explain everything clearly. It isn't stiff and formal. Well to understand and I think when we have the Basics down the Rest of this work in progress will work out fine. We're looking forward  to being able to dance a bit on our next trip, rather than just tapping our Toes to the music. The CD is great and i'd recommend it  for anyone who wants to learn at home.",1468368000,3,504,4.08080808080808

2995929,5,B000X1GTCO,"This video was easy to understand and use. After watching the video and practicing for a few days, I felt much more confident in my personal dance lessons. This video does a good job of breaking down techniques used and gives you understanding of why certain moves are done. I feel like I still have a long way to go in the dancing field, but this video definitely help me to learn the basic foundation of dancing. I review this based off my own personal opinion.",1459382400,2,463,4.395348837209302

2995945,5,B000X1GTCO,Wow! I bought this video for my daughter and her escort to learn how to dance for prom.  They have already learned the slow dance and waltz in just two days of practice.

2995950,5,B000X1GTCO,"I love this video. It is a sampler to get you started. The instruction is easy to follow and fun.

Some reviews complain that this video is advertisement for other products by the Trautmans. It is not. It teaches real dance steps that you can use within minutes.

It is a sampler that teaches dance steps with information telling you exactly where to go to get more of a certain dance style you are interested in.

At the end of each dance style, the instructors demonstrate some more advanced moves and explain which of their additional videos will teach them.

This method teaches different dance steps and how to combine them to truly do a lead/follow dance rather than a bunch of disjointed movements leaving you not knowing how to proceed.

If you know what dance you wish to learn, then get that video specifically.
If you are like me and just wanted to dance but didn't know where to start, this is a great video to get you started. I am glad I bought it as my husband and I are trying dances that I erroneously believed we would not be interested in.

Shawn and his wife do an excellent job of teaching both lead and follow to every dance. This was so much easier to follow and learn then other products I have seen.

Do a little research into this product line and you will not be disappointed.",1449014400,6,1303,4.404166666666667
2995951,3,B000X1GTCO,"This was easy to follow and very helpful.  My only negative is that they should include a couple of music files so you can practice the steps.
This is a very basic introduction to several steps, apparently designed to get your interest so that you will purchase the complete lesson.",1449014400,,282,4.64

2995981,4,B000X1GTCO,"Good lessons for the beginer and the more stationary dances like the swing.  But for traveling dances the demonstrations on a small dance floor area make it very difficult to follow.  Constantly traveling in a small circle which is not typical of a dance floor so difficult to follow the footwork, ex: waltz and the two step.",1421280000,,325,4.684210526315789

2996004,4,B000X1GTCO,"Very clear instruction, dances showed slowly and explained in great detail, very well done.  The reason for only four stars is the selection of dances for this Basic 101 disc.  I would have expected this as a basic dance instruction disc to include, besides the waltz, cha-cha, and swing which are on this disc, to have also fox trot, tango, rumba, samba, jive, and polka (would have needed it on my travels!), and leave out the slow dance, salsa, 2-step, hustle, west coast swing.",1409961600,5,481,4.714285714285714

2996021,5,B000X1GTCO,Very well done and clearly gives the step pattern  I got this as a refresher course being it has been some time since I had the pleasure of dancing.  What more joy can you get in this life than some good music and great dance,1397865600,2,225,3.977777777777778

Unfortunately this is nothing like what I needed it to be. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure that Shawn Trautman makes some excellent instructional dance videos. This just was not what I was expecting it to be. They give you a very very very brief run through of some of the more popular forms of ballroom dancing. Not enough for he and I to really gain anything from. It was my fault, I should have bought one of the dance specific DVDS.",1375920000,2,605,4.315789473684211

2996036,5,B000X1GTCO,This video is easy to follow and my fiance and I are excited to learn how to properly partner dance.

2996038,2,B000X1GTCO,"Just wanted basic dance moves.  This dvd gave to many dances basics.  Wanted to learn several steps and this dvd didn't stick to one dance.  Went into many dances so it really didn't help learn a dance.  You would be better off getting a basic dance on a dvd and learn that dance.  This dvd was more of types of dances and not how to learn to dance one type.  Not worth the $$$, and wish I didn't spend the money on this one.  Still don't know how to really dance a slow dance that looks good on the dance floor.",1363824000,5,512,4.00990099009901

2996055,4,B000X1GTCO,"We bought this DVD to learn some dance moves before our wedding. While the basics are provided for a number of dances, they are VERY basic. If you are someone who already has a brief understanding of some of these dances, skip this one and choose one that is only for one type of dance. They go through 2-3 moves for each dance and then how to put them together. Thats about it. One thing I really did like about this though is that the instructors show you a few times, from different angles, how exactly the move is done. They begin doing the move once, then you follow along once, and then they do it faster, and then you follow faster. And then they go through it two or three more times until they move on. My husband is doesn't pick up dance or rhythm very quickly so this was great. It allowed us time to really get the hang of each move before they moved on to the next. At the end of each segment, you run through the whole routine two or three times, in the correct timing, so it gives you a little practice time.",1356739200,2,1023,4.1457286432160805

2996057,5,B000X1GTCO,This is the way to go!  Forget expensive group dance lessons.  Learning in my living room and being able to take my time reviewing the steps has made learning to dance more enjoyable.

We moved the furniture out of the way and popped in the DVD.  The first of several dances covered is the simple slow dance.  There were several tips that we never thought of (hand positioning, how to lead, etc).  We practiced with the DVD only three times, but had it down pretty well for our first dance.
We didn't exactly amaze our guests with our dancing ability, but it was much better than just swaying together out there.  We had good footwork and even incorporated a twirl or two.  This was just what we were looking for.",1342656000,2,787,4.4375
2996062,5,B000X1GTCO,"My wife and I bought this Dvd after beginning local dance classes.  We thought it would be helpful in giving us a chance to study ahead for the upcoming classes that would follow our first which was the Night Club 2 Step (NC2S).  We have since used it for the Cha Cha and the Slow or Rhythm Step.  Their DVD has been extremely helpful to us.  Shawn and Joanna do an excellent job of combining their instruction and the video and audio are top quality.  Their instructions and pointers regarding framing, contact points, and leading and following were wonderful and something that our local instructor had only covered briefly for us because of the varied levels of the other students in our group class.

We found this introductory sample of their instruction to not only be very helpful, but it has quickly become our best reference source during our weekly practice sessions.  One warning:  use of this dvd has resulted in our purchasing several additional ST 101 Dvds (Swing, NC2S, Waltz, Salsa and Cha Cha) to further progress in our learning so budget appropriately and have fun dancing!",1326844800,5,1092,4.7712765957446805

Even though I loved each lesson, I was forgetting the steps in between lessons. I kept asking my instructor if there was an instructional DVD I could use to practice. He said there was nothing of quality out there.

Then I stumbled on the Shawn Trautman DVD dance series. The dance steps are amazingly easy to follow. Shawn teaches the leader's part; his wife Joanna teaches the follower's part. I quickly learned the ChaCha, Waltz, East Coast & West Coast Swings, Salsa, Rumba, and more! My dance instructor couldn't believe how fast I was improving! He asked me what I was doing...I didn't disclose my secret Shawn Traut DVDs! I have saved hundreds of dollars on private lessons...one Shawn Trautman DVD costs less than 15 minutes of my private lessons...and I can keep practicing with the DVD!

Neither of us had ever learned to dance as a couple and always found ourselves sitting at weddings and other functions while others danced the night away, enjoying themselves.  So, we purchased the DVD.  We found it very enjoyable and it was just what we needed to gain enough confidence to start dancing and to stick with it.  We have purchased other Shawn Trautman DVDs and are enjoying those too.  We also have taken free classes at a local country/western night club but sometimes found the classes went too fast for us -- the DVDs allow us to ""rewind"" and practice over and over until we get it right, before moving on to the next step.

It is a bargain compared to any dance lesson. We were both pleasantly surprised and have purchased the Slow Dance for beginners which we also love.

If you're still a beginner, but have already taken a few classes before, this will be too basic and boring for you.
Pros:
Slow-paced explanation, so you don't feel overwhelmed and ready to quit. They repeat each move quite a few times making it easy to memorize.
Cons:
Shawn Trautman, the instructor, does most of the talking while referring to the male audience more than to the female. The lady only makes a few comments now and then. I'd rather that they had no ""picture-in-picture technology"" because what's supposed to be a close-up picture is only about 110% larger than the one in the background. So when the two pictures are squeezed into the screen space, both become small. Also it would help if at least some of the moves were shown while the instructors were turned away from the camera - the same direction the audience is facing. And yes, they do talk a lot, which would be OK if they didn't stop dancing while talking.",1280102400,12,1100,4.704663212435233

The dvd is also tracked so that you can skip to the practice dance and do just that, practice with music.  Today, I contacted the office to purchase additional dvds and spoke to Shawn.

2996099,5,B000X1GTCO,"Shawn Trautman's Dance Sampler is a GREAT place to start!

His website has a breakdown of each move that is taught for each dance on this video. To find the list, go to his website, [...]  Locate this DVD and then click on ""What dances and moves are taught in Dance Lessons 101?""

He covers a lot of territory on this DVD!

This DVD starts with the ""rules of engagement,"" how to hold on to your partner, where to stand, which foot to start on and then progresses through the different dances from the easiest to the more difficult.

While ladies are always right and guys get what's left, the guys get to lead.  They should take advantage of it!  Shawn explains the WHAT and HOW of being a good lead. Ladies, we don't get to be our partners ""coach"" on the dance floor.  This too is a learning process.

There is no need to master all the dances or moves on this DVD before you go dancing.  If you want to learn ""something"" in a hurry, start with slow dance and if you have time, add the waltz. The skip feature on your DVD player will be your friend as you review each lesson. Add additional dances when you are ready to move on.

Shawn has done a great job of ""condensing"" each dance lesson that is taught on this DVD.  If the same lesson for each dance were taught in a ballroom setting, it would probably encompass at least a one hour lesson--possibly more than one lesson--just to get the basics.

So, don't be discouraged if you have not mastered all the dances in 124 minutes!  Unless you have a dance background, each dance will need to be reviewed over and over again and practiced.

If you only want to learn the basics of each of the dances--slow dance, waltz, two-step, swing, hustle, salsa, cha-cha, west coast swing--this DVD will be enough to satisfy that desire.  You will be able to go dancing anywhere with a decent repertoire so that you will look good and feel confident on the dance floor.

After you have mastered the basics given in each lesson on this DVD, additional DVDs and DVD sets are available that will allow you to expand your horizons if you wish.  If you love Two-Step or West Coast swing for instance, Shawn offers three DVD sets for each of those dances that will take you from beginner to intermediate. The individual DVDs in the sets can be purchased seperately.

This DVD can be used to replace ballroom dance class instruction or used as an enhancement for ballroom classes.  It may also serve as a refresher course if you haven't been dancing in awhile and want to ""brush up"" on your skills before a big date or a night dancing.

We own this DVD and have purchased three to give as gifts this Christmas. In addition, we own two of Shawn's three DVD sets. We have purchased them from:  Amazon Marketplace Merchants, ebay and from Shawn's website. Ask about price matching.

We have viewed a number of other dance videos.  I always find something to take away and use.  However, when selecting a DVD to buy and gift, it is hard to beat Shawn's teaching.  The inclusion of eight dances on this DVD makes it a winner.  If you can only afford one DVD and need it to cover a lot of territory, this is the one to buy.",1258156800,15,3150,4.376936316695353

2996101,5,B000X1GTCO,"Ten and twenty years ago, my wife and I took a few months of weekly dancing lessons for around $600 each. After each lesson, I couldn't remember much of what we had learned in the previous lesson and my wife and I would disagree with our steps. Because each of the dance companies were preparing us to dance competitively, although we were there to learn to dance socially, my back was always hurting after each lesson from trying to conform my body to these exact positionings. My wife and I learned very little, and thus when we went out dancing we rarely used anything from our dance lessons but just danced like everyone else did, so we could have fun. When we saw others dancing ballroom style, they always danced the same basic moves counter-clockwise around the dance floor (i.e., forward, left turns, and lady turns), regardless of which dance they were performing.

After 33 years of marriage and dancing in our own styles, I thought I'd try learning ballroom dancing for my wife again but decided to try something different. I bought 6 of Shawn's dancing DVD's and took them with us on our vacation, watching one dance lesson each day, taking my time analyzing them and making detailed notes of each move (my wife would watch them after I had studied them, as she could learn faster and remember better than I did). In each lesson, we learned more than several lessons with either of the dance companies I mentioned above. Then my wife and I took our time to slowly work on each dance together. We moved the chairs and table out of the kitchens and set up speakers that were hooked up to my computer to play music, and would dance for an hour each night to different songs. Just for fun, we even tried new moves that Shawn hadn't taught and probably doesn't exist. Learning to dance was enjoyable and dancing with my wife turned out to be a wonderful experience - I finally understood the joy of dancing with one I love. After three weeks traveling through the U.S. and dancing almost every day, my wife and I knew how to perform 10 different dances well. We next went on a cruise, where we danced these dances every night and received compliments that we appeared to have been dancing for years.

Since our cruise, we were unable to dance for a few weeks, so I forgot many of our dance moves. Unlike taking lessons from the dance companies, we didn't have to pay to relearn the dances - I went back to my notes and went back to Shawn's lessons and were quickly able to relearn the dances.

We have since purchased additional dance videos from Shawn and will purchase additional ones in a few months. He takes his time instructing us and gives various angles to his lessons. I'm sure you will see how great he and his wife do from the other reviewers, so there's no need to cover that here. I just want you to see the benefits of purchasing his DVD's over taking dance lessons from the dance companies (even if you want to compete, I suggest you learn the dance lessons from him first, as he was a dance teacher at one of those companies long ago according to his statements on his DVD's and in his book).

Before you purchase a DVD of his, I recommend you purchase his book, which comes with a DVD of dance videos before purchasing your first DVD.",1253923200,126,3258,4.470588235294118

It worked!!!

We had a blast at the reception and had 4 (yes, 4!!) compliments on how good we looked and how much fun we were having (this never happens to us).

It was a good way to get us started without the steps. We liked doing it on video, too, because we had to stop a few times and practice and talk through what we were learning. Overall, there were so many things we liked and only a few we thought could be improved. Here are my notes -

Pros: excellent instruction; easy to see and follow; down to earth instructors; a lot less than private lessons; convenient; information that made sense; a good flow to the lessons; a lot of information; instruction was done in a small space similar to what we learned in; two hours of lessons; good variety of dances; the fact that we learned without anyone watching us!

Cons: not enough practice time to music; there were a few times we had questions and couldn't ask anyone.

Overall, we were thrilled with what we got out of this DVD and will definitely be buying more of Shawn's videos. If you're looking for a great value and easy dance lessons, give this one a try. I'm convinced that if it worked for us, it can work for anyone!",1237766400,48,1864,4.192737430167598
2996124,5,B000X1GTCO,"I've now told several of my friends they should watch this video before taking private lessons.  Having spent over $1K in lessons in the last month, I was more than surprised to see how much we picked up by going through these lessons.  Shawn and his partner are surprisingly clear with their instructions and very straightforward about the lessons. We found it not only helpful, but encouraging as we feel like we can actually get out and dance now.  I've already ordered several other of Shawn's DVDs and am looking forward to them!",1237420800,8,534,4.720430107526882
2996125,5,B000X1GTCO,The dance instruction is clear and the photography shows the steps from more that one direction.  It's a great overview to the different dances to help you pick out which dances you want to focus on and then buy the specific instruction cd for that dance.  I like their style of instruction.,1236902400,2,291,4.576923076923077
2996126,5,B000X1GTCO,My husband and I are enjoying learning a few steps of a variety of dances.  It's just enough to make you want to buy more!,1234224000,2,122,3.88
2996127,5,B000X1GTCO,"With all of the other wedding expenses, our dance lessons with a personal instructor fell out of the budget.  We decided to at least get an instructional DVD to help us out.  We have had a great time learning to slow dance and will have a lot more confidence on the day of the wedding.  This DVD is a collection of a number of dances.  Because we wanted to focus specifically on the slow dance - we ended up ordering another one of Shawn's DVD that was all slow dance instruction.  Shawn and his wife are great instructors.  I feel like we should almost invite them to the wedding!",1233619200,5,581,4.284403669724771
2996128,5,B000X1GTCO,"Great! Easy to understand. Camera shows many angles and the instructor goes slow and progresses to the whole dance routine a little at a time.
We have just begun to learn and expect to do well. Once we get the basics I will want the more difficult instruction DVDs. Thanks Shawn!",1232323200,2,279,4.490196078431373
2996139,2,B000X1GTCO,Instructions are clear and the demonstrations would be helpful to anyone who has not danced before.  I was not really impressed with the technique or style shown in the demonstrations of what the dance should look like and the pace was a little slow.  Definitely not for anyone who has dance experience and anyone using this would need to go to a good teacher to get some style.,1231804800,6,378,4.544117647058823
2996140,5,B000X1GTCO,We have no idea and I mean NO IDEA of how to even shuffle let alone dance so it was a lovely surprise of how simple and basic the start was and how straight forward the instructions. We really enjoy the lessons and more importantly have a good time doing them.,1231200000,4,260,4.117647058823529
2996141,5,B000X1GTCO,just purchased my first dance video.  we have been taking dance lessons at a local studio for weeks now and at times we find ourselves practicing the dance steps wrong after class.  after viewing dance lessons 101 we are dancing much better because this video explains at a much smaller pace and we can always rewind.  i really recommend this video to everyone who wants to learn the basic steps.,1229904000,4,396,4.628571428571429
2996142,5,B000X1GTCO,"I ordered this for my Mother as a Christmas Gift (2008) and she loves it.  She is 73 yrs. old, and attending a class to learn ballroom dancing. She says this instructional video is better than the live classes and wants to order more.",1229644800,2,234,4.318181818181818
2996143,5,B000X1GTCO,Have only watched part of the video so far. Seems to be user friendly. Great for beginners.,1227657600,2,91,4.411764705882353
2996144,5,B000X1GTCO,"Just as advertised, this DVD is an excellent intro to 8 dances for beginners.  There is a good introductory section followed by very clear instructions to get you started doing each dance. The level of repetition was just right for me to pick up enough detail, and the subsequent demonstrations of what was just taught also showed additional moves that could be learned by buying other videos.  There is plenty of content, so you don't feel shortchanged.",1224892800,3,454,4.883116883116883
2996145,3,B000X1GTCO,the instructions were very clear but I would have like a little bit faster pace.  Overall I thought it was great for beginners.,1221523200,6,127,4.521739130434782
2996146,5,B000X1GTCO,"This instructional video is great!  I would highly recommend it to others, and do plan to purchase more in the future.  We loved Shawn's slow, repetitive teaching style.  He's easy to follow and feels like he's talking directly to us as we watch.  Of course the DVD rewind and pause button are great also!",1221091200,3,305,4.592592592592593
2996147,5,B000X1GTCO,I love Shawn's DVDs. He is skilled at bringing simplicity to dance lessons and teaching beginners. I have many dance videos and his are by far the best! It's almost like taking private lessons; just at home and a lot cheaper. Many of my friends have already heard about his DVDs as they've absolutely done right by me. Shawn and his wife both do a wonderful job of teaching.,1220918400,5,374,4.434782608695652
2996148,5,B000X1GTCO,"Even though I grew up dancing...(my father would take us out honky tonkin') my husband isn't much of a dancer.  With a willing spirit though he wanted to learn.  If only you could have been there when he took me in his arms, holding me the way he was instructed, and said...""WOW!"" ""You really do go where I want you to""! (Probably every husbands dream) :) Then he starts placing me here and there.  We had a GREAT TIME!  With a little practice, we'll be all over the dance floor.  Thanks so much!!! EXCELLENT INSTRUCTION AND FUN DANCE STEPS TO LEARN!!!",1219708800,7,552,4.425742574257426
2996159,5,B000X1GTCO,"Shawn Trautman is a GREAT instructor!  I attended one of his Dance Lessons 101 Live classes last week and was blown away by his teaching methods and ability to break dances down into pieces that everyone understood.  I've taken many dance classes and this was by far the best I've ever taken. As a middle school teacher, I can honestly say I didn't expect to be impressed in the manner I was and I know others in the class were equally impressed.

I purchased Dance Lessons 101 and strongly recommend it!  I already know some of the dances featured on the DVD, like West Coast Swing and Hustle, but have struggled to get the right techniques and footwork.  Other dances I've seen, but not danced, so I was pleased.  This DVD is very easy for me to follow, and I can replay and practice the footwork I need help with until it ""clicks"" for me.  I really like how Shawn and his wife, Joanna, explain things thoroughly and demonstrate on the screen exactly as I see it; in other words, it's not the mirror image. Like excellent teachers of any subject do, they anticipate and answer questions you might have such as where your weight should be, or what to do with your hands. Joanna offers tips about things that make the dances easier for her to follow, and I find myself practicing those techniques as well. It's almost like being in your own 2 hour private lesson that you've recorded and can play back to review.  I also liked that Shawn shows a little more of what you can learn in each dance from his other DVDs.  You won't get to be an expert in any of these dances by this one DVD, but you can certainly learn enough to go out and have fun with each of the 8 dances. If you're new to dancing or just want to learn some new dances like I did, you should give Dance Lessons 101 a try.",1215907200,20,1786,4.291666666666667
2996160,5,B000X1GTCO,"My husband and I have a wedding to go to soon, so we are just using a few lessons to crash course how to do a couple of dances so we look like we know what we are doing. The lessons are very slow giving you a good amount of time to figure it out without having to pause and step back all the time (something I appreciate greatly, but if you are more experienced, this probably isn't for you). The only complaint I have is that the ""intro"" part is really long and you can't skip it, but really that's it. Good teachers!",1213228800,6,518,3.9903846153846154
2996161,5,B000X1GTCO,"I've tried a couple of dance videos and several dance classes. This is the best instruction I've seen.  Shawn really takes his time in explaining each detail, how the guy leads, exactly what the steps are.  A lot of the other videos and classes I've tried went too fast.  Other dance teachers, do things automatically without ever stopping to explain what they are doing.",1212624000,11,371,4.765625
2996162,3,B000X1GTCO,"I have taken dance lessons off and on for ten years, but my husband wanted me to buy a DVD we could do together and this seemed like a really good value - eight dances for the price of two!

The pacing in this was quite slow for me and the instructors do not always seem to be ""on the beat"" when demonstrating the dances. Also, the screen-within-a-screen feature is really not helpful. More zoom ins on the instructors' feet, and more variation in Shawn's voice would have made this more lively. But for an absolute beginner (such as the father of the bride wanting to learn how to dance with his daughter on her big day), this would fit the bill.

If you're like me and have some dance experience,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dancing-Like-the-Pros/dp/B000TPTCSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dancing Like the Pros</a>&nbsp;is a better bet.",1212192000,42,884,5.307142857142857
2996163,5,B000X1GTCO,"As I read other reviews for this DVD, I feel like the student who is called on by the teacher and says ""yeah, what they said"".  Seriously, I really enjoyed the format, the way Shawn taught, the extra tips, and the easy-going style. After viewing several dance lesson videos from the library (which were just awful!) I am so thrilled with this product.  Yes, I'll buy more of their DVDs.",1211932800,10,386,4.5
2996164,5,B000X1GTCO,The instruction on this DVD is better than the 3 classes we've been to and we can pratice when we have time!,1210204800,5,108,3.9545454545454546
2996165,5,B000X1GTCO,"I highly recommend the Shawn Trautman instructional dance DVDs.  Shawn and his wife Joanna are excellent teachers.  Shawn does a good job of breaking down the footwork and also provides tips on style and leading.  Joanna does a very good job of providing info on following and style- and she makes cute and funny comments along the way.  They are very down to earth and personable and really care about feedback from dancers.

This DVD is a great place to start for an overview of many of the most popular ballroom and social dance styles.  Each dance is covered briefly in one chapter.  If you want more detail about a specific dance you could purchase a DVD from Shawn Trautman's collection devoted to that specific dance (which we decided to do with west coast swing- which is actually a series of several DVDs).  However, even from this one DVD we were able to learn enough basics, footwork, and rhythm to do nightclub two step, cha cha cha, and hustle on the dance floor in public.  This is also a great overview for an ""advanced beginner""- someone who is already a dancer in one or more styles and wants to learn a new dance.",1209600000,34,1131,4.532019704433497
2996166,4,B000X1GTCO,"This video is all that it claims to be--basic instruction for beginners-- and I was not disappointed.  The Trautmans make learning these basic steps so easy, I was amazed.  Presentation is excellent, and the basics on how to lead, follow, and body position are very helpful.",1208822400,7,274,4.934782608695652
2996167,5,B000X1GTCO,"My wife and I have watched the Shawn Trautman Dance Lessons 101 DVD several times.  Each time we view a dance lesson, we are picking up new dance steps that neither I (nor my wife) ever thought possible!  Being able to watch the steps, pause, practice and rewind at our convenience takes the pressure off learning new routines.  Not only are we starting to look pretty good on the dance floor, we're actually having a great time during the video lessons.  We look forward to getting other Shawn Trautman Dance Lesson DVDs.",1207699200,16,522,4.641304347826087
2996168,5,B000X1GTCO,"After starting out with live dance lessons, my wife and I picked up several other instructional dance DVDs from our local library (at no cost) to have a reference to use for practice in between lessons.  I ran across Dance Lessons 101 while searching for something better, because the freebies from the library just weren't cutting it.  This was my first Shawn/Joanna Trautman instructional DVD and I'll be buying more.  Absolutely the best explanation/demonstration of how to lead (if you're the guy) and how to follow (if your the gal).  This DVD was easier to understand and follow than the dance lessons we were taking with live instruction.  Shawn and Joann'a explanations/demonstrations are just that good! Great overview of all the dances listed, and you would do well by just mastering the basics of each dance shown in the DVD.  But after seeing the DVD, my wife and I want to get some of the other Trautman DVDs and get more advanced.",1207267200,11,944,4.796296296296297
3230412,5,B000X1GTCO,"My husband and I are really enjoying Dance Lessons 101.  We were looking for a way to get some exercise and enjoy each other's company after our son goes to bed.  This DVD has been perfect.  It was so interesting that even after 12 years of marriage the dance lessons gave us that awkward but fun experience you have when you first date someone.  We were forced to be aware of our personal space and the shared space between us.  We laughed about the way we were trying to get our bodies to move, and about each other's awkwardness.  This DVD has given us an opportunity to reconnect and take time for each other in the comfort of our home.  This video is paced well and is easy to understand.  I love the variety of dances we are learning and feel certain we will be purchasing more Shawn Trautman DVDs in the future.  Finally, I really appreciate that Shawn and his wife come across as ""down to earth"" people.  Obviously they know how to dance and both have great skill, but they make it appear attainable for the average couple.  Thank you so much.",1207180800,33,1051,4.365979381443299

By the end of the lesson, I was so excited that I had learned the steps - it's almost as if I internalized them.",1201478400,63,326,4.508474576271187

3230447,5,B000X1GTCO,"I love this video. It is a sampler to get you started. The instruction is easy to follow and fun.

Some reviews complain that this video is advertisement for other products by the Trautmans. It is not. It teaches real dance steps that you can use within minutes.

It is a sampler that teaches dance steps with information telling you exactly where to go to get more of a certain dance style you are interested in.

At the end of each dance style, the instructors demonstrate some more advanced moves and explain which of their additional videos will teach them.

This method teaches different dance steps and how to combine them to truly do a lead/follow dance rather than a bunch of disjointed movements leaving you not knowing how to proceed.

If you know what dance you wish to learn, then get that video specifically.
If you are like me and just wanted to dance but didn't know where to start, this is a great video to get you started. I am glad I bought it as my husband and I are trying dances that I erroneously believed we would not be interested in.

Shawn and his wife do an excellent job of teaching both lead and follow to every dance. This was so much easier to follow and learn then other products I have seen.

Do a little research into this product line and you will not be disappointed.",1449014400,6,1303,4.404166666666667

3230552,4,B000X1GTCO,"We bought this DVD to learn some dance moves before our wedding. While the basics are provided for a number of dances, they are VERY basic. If you are someone who already has a brief understanding of some of these dances, skip this one and choose one that is only for one type of dance. They go through 2-3 moves for each dance and then how to put them together. Thats about it. One thing I really did like about this though is that the instructors show you a few times, from different angles, how exactly the move is done. They begin doing the move once, then you follow along once, and then they do it faster, and then you follow faster. And then they go through it two or three more times until they move on. My husband is doesn't pick up dance or rhythm very quickly so this was great. It allowed us time to really get the hang of each move before they moved on to the next. At the end of each segment, you run through the whole routine two or three times, in the correct timing, so it gives you a little practice time.",1356739200,2,1023,4.1457286432160805

We moved the furniture out of the way and popped in the DVD.  The first of several dances covered is the simple slow dance.  There were several tips that we never thought of (hand positioning, how to lead, etc).  We practiced with the DVD only three times, but had it down pretty well for our first dance.
We didn't exactly amaze our guests with our dancing ability, but it was much better than just swaying together out there.  We had good footwork and even incorporated a twirl or two.  This was just what we were looking for.",1342656000,2,787,4.4375
3230559,5,B000X1GTCO,"My wife and I bought this Dvd after beginning local dance classes.  We thought it would be helpful in giving us a chance to study ahead for the upcoming classes that would follow our first which was the Night Club 2 Step (NC2S).  We have since used it for the Cha Cha and the Slow or Rhythm Step.  Their DVD has been extremely helpful to us.  Shawn and Joanna do an excellent job of combining their instruction and the video and audio are top quality.  Their instructions and pointers regarding framing, contact points, and leading and following were wonderful and something that our local instructor had only covered briefly for us because of the varied levels of the other students in our group class.

We found this introductory sample of their instruction to not only be very helpful, but it has quickly become our best reference source during our weekly practice sessions.  One warning:  use of this dvd has resulted in our purchasing several additional ST 101 Dvds (Swing, NC2S, Waltz, Salsa and Cha Cha) to further progress in our learning so budget appropriately and have fun dancing!",1326844800,5,1092,4.7712765957446805

Even though I loved each lesson, I was forgetting the steps in between lessons. I kept asking my instructor if there was an instructional DVD I could use to practice. He said there was nothing of quality out there.

Then I stumbled on the Shawn Trautman DVD dance series. The dance steps are amazingly easy to follow. Shawn teaches the leader's part; his wife Joanna teaches the follower's part. I quickly learned the ChaCha, Waltz, East Coast & West Coast Swings, Salsa, Rumba, and more! My dance instructor couldn't believe how fast I was improving! He asked me what I was doing...I didn't disclose my secret Shawn Traut DVDs! I have saved hundreds of dollars on private lessons...one Shawn Trautman DVD costs less than 15 minutes of my private lessons...and I can keep practicing with the DVD!

Neither of us had ever learned to dance as a couple and always found ourselves sitting at weddings and other functions while others danced the night away, enjoying themselves.  So, we purchased the DVD.  We found it very enjoyable and it was just what we needed to gain enough confidence to start dancing and to stick with it.  We have purchased other Shawn Trautman DVDs and are enjoying those too.  We also have taken free classes at a local country/western night club but sometimes found the classes went too fast for us -- the DVDs allow us to ""rewind"" and practice over and over until we get it right, before moving on to the next step.

This video won't teach you enough about any particular dance but it does give you enough information to try a dance style and decide whether you like the Trautman's teaching style (which we love!) and what further DVD's to purchase. It is a bargain compared to any dance lesson. We were both pleasantly surprised and have purchased the Slow Dance for beginners which we also love.

3230587,3,B000X1GTCO,"Beware - this is rather social than professional training. I recently started taking ballroom dance classes, and this DVD is a bit different from competitive dancing. If you're still a beginner, but have already taken a few classes before, this will be too basic and boring for you.
Pros:
Slow-paced explanation, so you don't feel overwhelmed and ready to quit. They repeat each move quite a few times making it easy to memorize.
Cons:
Shawn Trautman, the instructor, does most of the talking while referring to the male audience more than to the female. The lady only makes a few comments now and then. I'd rather that they had no ""picture-in-picture technology"" because what's supposed to be a close-up picture is only about 110% larger than the one in the background. So when the two pictures are squeezed into the screen space, both become small. Also it would help if at least some of the moves were shown while the instructors were turned away from the camera - the same direction the audience is facing. And yes, they do talk a lot, which would be OK if they didn't stop dancing while talking.",1280102400,12,1100,4.704663212435233
3230588,3,B000X1GTCO,"This is a very well prepared video. I only wish it had more than just the very basic steps. It is obviously a tool for these dance instructors to sell additional videos that contain more steps. I will buy some of them for sure, they are very good instructors. I think this is better than real lessons I have taken. I like that I can go back over the steps with rewind, or can do practice as much as I like, watching the instructors to make sure I am doing steps properly.",1278806400,5,471,4.130434782608695
3230589,4,B000X1GTCO,"I have purchased a number of dance instruction dvds over the past 2 years but I found this one to be the most helpful of all of the ones I have bought and tried.  The people dancing come across as an authentic average couple who enjoy dancing and sharing that skill set with others.  The approach is low key which works for me and they see to it that you can see, hear and experience the moves and steps.  I was able to rewind and pick up what I had missed without any problem.  The dvd is also tracked so that you can skip to the practice dance and do just that, practice with music.  Today, I contacted the office to purchase additional dvds and spoke to Shawn.  He came across calm, very personable and intent on helping me to get exactly what I wanted.  I appreciated this personal service.  I certainly recommend his dvds to others.",1273449600,12,837,4.286624203821656

3230596,5,B000X1GTCO,"Shawn Trautman's Dance Sampler is a GREAT place to start!

His website has a breakdown of each move that is taught for each dance on this video. To find the list, go to his website, [...]  Locate this DVD and then click on ""What dances and moves are taught in Dance Lessons 101?""

He covers a lot of territory on this DVD!

This DVD starts with the ""rules of engagement,"" how to hold on to your partner, where to stand, which foot to start on and then progresses through the different dances from the easiest to the more difficult.

While ladies are always right and guys get what's left, the guys get to lead.  They should take advantage of it!  Shawn explains the WHAT and HOW of being a good lead. Ladies, we don't get to be our partners ""coach"" on the dance floor.  This too is a learning process.

There is no need to master all the dances or moves on this DVD before you go dancing.  If you want to learn ""something"" in a hurry, start with slow dance and if you have time, add the waltz. The skip feature on your DVD player will be your friend as you review each lesson. Add additional dances when you are ready to move on.

Shawn has done a great job of ""condensing"" each dance lesson that is taught on this DVD.  If the same lesson for each dance were taught in a ballroom setting, it would probably encompass at least a one hour lesson--possibly more than one lesson--just to get the basics.

So, don't be discouraged if you have not mastered all the dances in 124 minutes!  Unless you have a dance background, each dance will need to be reviewed over and over again and practiced.

If you only want to learn the basics of each of the dances--slow dance, waltz, two-step, swing, hustle, salsa, cha-cha, west coast swing--this DVD will be enough to satisfy that desire.  You will be able to go dancing anywhere with a decent repertoire so that you will look good and feel confident on the dance floor.

After you have mastered the basics given in each lesson on this DVD, additional DVDs and DVD sets are available that will allow you to expand your horizons if you wish.  If you love Two-Step or West Coast swing for instance, Shawn offers three DVD sets for each of those dances that will take you from beginner to intermediate. The individual DVDs in the sets can be purchased seperately.

This DVD can be used to replace ballroom dance class instruction or used as an enhancement for ballroom classes.  It may also serve as a refresher course if you haven't been dancing in awhile and want to ""brush up"" on your skills before a big date or a night dancing.

We own this DVD and have purchased three to give as gifts this Christmas. In addition, we own two of Shawn's three DVD sets. We have purchased them from:  Amazon Marketplace Merchants, ebay and from Shawn's website. Ask about price matching.

We have viewed a number of other dance videos.  I always find something to take away and use.  However, when selecting a DVD to buy and gift, it is hard to beat Shawn's teaching.  The inclusion of eight dances on this DVD makes it a winner.  If you can only afford one DVD and need it to cover a lot of territory, this is the one to buy.",1258156800,15,3150,4.376936316695353
3230597,3,B000X1GTCO,"This is a great DVD if you want a BRIEF overview of the dances.  This is not a dance instruction video, just a video to get you acquianted with the different dances.  If you actually want to learn how to dance, look elsewhere",1256601600,3,225,4.209302325581396
3230598,5,B000X1GTCO,"Ten and twenty years ago, my wife and I took a few months of weekly dancing lessons for around $600 each. After each lesson, I couldn't remember much of what we had learned in the previous lesson and my wife and I would disagree with our steps. Because each of the dance companies were preparing us to dance competitively, although we were there to learn to dance socially, my back was always hurting after each lesson from trying to conform my body to these exact positionings. My wife and I learned very little, and thus when we went out dancing we rarely used anything from our dance lessons but just danced like everyone else did, so we could have fun. When we saw others dancing ballroom style, they always danced the same basic moves counter-clockwise around the dance floor (i.e., forward, left turns, and lady turns), regardless of which dance they were performing.

After 33 years of marriage and dancing in our own styles, I thought I'd try learning ballroom dancing for my wife again but decided to try something different. I bought 6 of Shawn's dancing DVD's and took them with us on our vacation, watching one dance lesson each day, taking my time analyzing them and making detailed notes of each move (my wife would watch them after I had studied them, as she could learn faster and remember better than I did). In each lesson, we learned more than several lessons with either of the dance companies I mentioned above. Then my wife and I took our time to slowly work on each dance together. We moved the chairs and table out of the kitchens and set up speakers that were hooked up to my computer to play music, and would dance for an hour each night to different songs. Just for fun, we even tried new moves that Shawn hadn't taught and probably doesn't exist. Learning to dance was enjoyable and dancing with my wife turned out to be a wonderful experience - I finally understood the joy of dancing with one I love. After three weeks traveling through the U.S. and dancing almost every day, my wife and I knew how to perform 10 different dances well. We next went on a cruise, where we danced these dances every night and received compliments that we appeared to have been dancing for years.

Since our cruise, we were unable to dance for a few weeks, so I forgot many of our dance moves. Unlike taking lessons from the dance companies, we didn't have to pay to relearn the dances - I went back to my notes and went back to Shawn's lessons and were quickly able to relearn the dances.

We have since purchased additional dance videos from Shawn and will purchase additional ones in a few months. He takes his time instructing us and gives various angles to his lessons. I'm sure you will see how great he and his wife do from the other reviewers, so there's no need to cover that here. I just want you to see the benefits of purchasing his DVD's over taking dance lessons from the dance companies (even if you want to compete, I suggest you learn the dance lessons from him first, as he was a dance teacher at one of those companies long ago according to his statements on his DVD's and in his book).

Before you purchase a DVD of his, I recommend you purchase his book, which comes with a DVD of dance videos before purchasing your first DVD.",1253923200,126,3258,4.470588235294118

It worked!!!

We had a blast at the reception and had 4 (yes, 4!!) compliments on how good we looked and how much fun we were having (this never happens to us). This was HUGE for my husband's confidence and I can tell you he was just soaking it up. We danced a good 10 dances that night, which is more than we've danced in the last 5 years. Oh, and Swing is now his ""favorite dance"".

This video was our first time trying to dance together and we quickly saw how much we had to learn. We liked how it started out with a number of things that are important for all dances. It was a good way to get us started without the steps. We liked doing it on video, too, because we had to stop a few times and practice and talk through what we were learning. Overall, there were so many things we liked and only a few we thought could be improved. Here are my notes -

Pros: excellent instruction; easy to see and follow; down to earth instructors; a lot less than private lessons; convenient; information that made sense; a good flow to the lessons; a lot of information; instruction was done in a small space similar to what we learned in; two hours of lessons; good variety of dances; the fact that we learned without anyone watching us!

Cons: not enough practice time to music; there were a few times we had questions and couldn't ask anyone.

Overall, we were thrilled with what we got out of this DVD and will definitely be buying more of Shawn's videos. If you're looking for a great value and easy dance lessons, give this one a try. I'm convinced that if it worked for us, it can work for anyone!",1237766400,48,1864,4.192737430167598

3230656,5,B000X1GTCO,"Shawn Trautman is a GREAT instructor!  I attended one of his Dance Lessons 101 Live classes last week and was blown away by his teaching methods and ability to break dances down into pieces that everyone understood.  I've taken many dance classes and this was by far the best I've ever taken. As a middle school teacher, I can honestly say I didn't expect to be impressed in the manner I was and I know others in the class were equally impressed.

I purchased Dance Lessons 101 and strongly recommend it!  I already know some of the dances featured on the DVD, like West Coast Swing and Hustle, but have struggled to get the right techniques and footwork.  Other dances I've seen, but not danced, so I was pleased.  This DVD is very easy for me to follow, and I can replay and practice the footwork I need help with until it ""clicks"" for me.  I really like how Shawn and his wife, Joanna, explain things thoroughly and demonstrate on the screen exactly as I see it; in other words, it's not the mirror image. Like excellent teachers of any subject do, they anticipate and answer questions you might have such as where your weight should be, or what to do with your hands. Joanna offers tips about things that make the dances easier for her to follow, and I find myself practicing those techniques as well. It's almost like being in your own 2 hour private lesson that you've recorded and can play back to review.  I also liked that Shawn shows a little more of what you can learn in each dance from his other DVDs.  You won't get to be an expert in any of these dances by this one DVD, but you can certainly learn enough to go out and have fun with each of the 8 dances. If you're new to dancing or just want to learn some new dances like I did, you should give Dance Lessons 101 a try.",1215907200,20,1786,4.291666666666667

Other dance teachers, do things automatically without ever stopping to explain what they are doing.",1212624000,11,371,4.765625

The pacing in this was quite slow for me and the instructors do not always seem to be ""on the beat"" when demonstrating the dances. Also, the screen-within-a-screen feature is really not helpful. More zoom ins on the instructors' feet, and more variation in Shawn's voice would have made this more lively.

This DVD is a great place to start for an overview of many of the most popular ballroom and social dance styles.  Each dance is covered briefly in one chapter.  If you want more detail about a specific dance you could purchase a DVD from Shawn Trautman's collection devoted to that specific dance (which we decided to do with west coast swing- which is actually a series of several DVDs).  However, even from this one DVD we were able to learn enough basics, footwork, and rhythm to do nightclub two step, cha cha cha, and hustle on the dance floor in public.  This is also a great overview for an ""advanced beginner""- someone who is already a dancer in one or more styles and wants to learn a new dance.",1209600000,34,1131,4.532019704433497
3230663,4,B000X1GTCO,"This video is all that it claims to be--basic instruction for beginners-- and I was not disappointed.  The Trautmans make learning these basic steps so easy, I was amazed.  Presentation is excellent, and the basics on how to lead, follow, and body position are very helpful.",1208822400,7,274,4.934782608695652
3230664,5,B000X1GTCO,"My wife and I have watched the Shawn Trautman Dance Lessons 101 DVD several times.  Each time we view a dance lesson, we are picking up new dance steps that neither I (nor my wife) ever thought possible!  Being able to watch the steps, pause, practice and rewind at our convenience takes the pressure off learning new routines.  Not only are we starting to look pretty good on the dance floor, we're actually having a great time during the video lessons.  We look forward to getting other Shawn Trautman Dance Lesson DVDs.",1207699200,16,522,4.641304347826087
3230665,5,B000X1GTCO,"After starting out with live dance lessons, my wife and I picked up several other instructional dance DVDs from our local library (at no cost) to have a reference to use for practice in between lessons.  I ran across Dance Lessons 101 while searching for something better, because the freebies from the library just weren't cutting it.  This was my first Shawn/Joanna Trautman instructional DVD and I'll be buying more.  Absolutely the best explanation/demonstration of how to lead (if you're the guy) and how to follow (if your the gal).  This DVD was easier to understand and follow than the dance lessons we were taking with live instruction.  Shawn and Joann'a explanations/demonstrations are just that good! Great overview of all the dances listed, and you would do well by just mastering the basics of each dance shown in the DVD.  But after seeing the DVD, my wife and I want to get some of the other Trautman DVDs and get more advanced.",1207267200,11,944,4.796296296296297

8226480,2,B000X1GTCO,"This dance lesson barely breaks down the lesson.  They show you the dance lesson; then quickly move on.  This is nice if you just want to see the dance quickly.  But it doesn't seem to help with detailed instructions, such as Where do you put your feet, how is the weight distribution, what is the timing, how do you lead.  For women, this video doesn't even show the lady's part so I don't know how they learn from just watching the guys part and a female partner going along.

I would have liked to have detailed instruction; repetition, and break down of the moves.

I bought another video at the same time by dance crazy, Ballroom dance mastery system, and it goes into great detail on the dances.  I think if you are learning the waltz, rumba, or foxtrot, you are better with more detail.",1491955200,,793,4.427586206896552
