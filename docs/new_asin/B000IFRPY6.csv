8145285,4,B000IFRPY6,"Going from the brilliance of staging and singing in Rheingold to the unimaginative staging and drabness of singing in Walkure made me double and triple check that it was indeed all of the same production. However, production values happily bounce back with Siegfried and Gotterdammerung.

Since this is the same production of the Ring Cycle included in the Wagner Edition collection, for a mere extra $40, you not only get this Ring, you also get all of Wagner's other operas (six more). So if you want to get this production of the Ring Cycle, you should definitely go with the Wagner Edition, rather than this set.",1398556800,,616,4.811320754716981
