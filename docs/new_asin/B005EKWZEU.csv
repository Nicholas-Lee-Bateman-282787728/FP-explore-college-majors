The encoding SUCKS.  It is what I would expect from a dollar-bin special!  This product is very deceiving, being in a nice box that claims to have a bonus color booklet??!!!  It is an accordion fold-out of ""important dates"" many of which I find irrelevant to the history of the railroads.  Not on the list is the Trans-Continental.

I don't often write harshly about a product however I feel that in this particular case I was cheated.  And now since it is opened, of course I cannot return it from where I purchased it.

Good luck, and keep your steam up!",1360454400,6,662,4.413223140495868
