7433624,5,B015EHCJ66,I have been waiting for the release of this in the USA.  I finally got my copy and although a lot of it is in German it is subtitled in English for those that don't understand German.,1449446400,,183,3.945945945945946
7433625,3,B015EHCJ66,"The subtitles were fine . it was good. Klaus is one heck of a nice guy. Been a fan of over 30 years ( although my love of this music is waning ) and it was nice to see more of their story. But if you read through it all - Scorpions are no different than any other rock band- they love being loved. You can tell. I thought i wanted to do this for a living when i was younger but there is one line towards the end where someone says "" when you have it all, anything less is hell ""  or something to that effect.

I will say it could have been a little more in depth and jumped around less, but it is good. Especially if you are a fan.",1449100800,,631,3.701492537313433
7433626,4,B015EHCJ66,"With a career that has spanned several decades and long-considered one of heavy metal's most successful acts worldwide, I always wondered why there was never a documentary about the Scorpions. Finally, one arrived in 2015, 'Forever and a Day.' Focusing on what was originally billed as the group's ""farewell tour"" (it appears as though the group has since reconsidered and continued on), you get great modern day behind the scenes footage of the band on the road and interacting with each other. But long-time fans will also get a kick out of snippets of great archival footage (such as rare scenes of the group from 1973), plus interviews with such former members as Michael Schenker and Herman Rarebell. And as evidenced by the more recent live footage - the band still puts on a great live show. Also included on the DVD version is a bonus interview from 1985, right around the time of their heady 'Love at First Sting'/""Rock You Like a Hurricane"" era. I definitely enjoyed watching this doc!",1448755200,2,995,4.824561403508772
7433627,2,B015EHCJ66,"When I found out that a documentarty movie on the Scorps was finally being released, I was excited, Movies like RUSH:beyond the lighted stage, and QUEEN days of our lives, really got into the deep history of the band's , which harcore fans wanted. However on this one, such is not the case, yes some interesting footage of the early days are on here, but that's it, and yes Michael Schenker is on here as well, but it seems to talk about lonesome crow era, and then pretty much jumps into Matthias joining, details about the albums are not really into discussion, and past members like Uli Roth, or Francis Buccholz ( which I didn't really expect to be on here anyways) or drummers in the band before Herman Rarebell, are not featured on here for interview. Also I understand that this film was originally shown in Europe , Mainly thier homeland of Germany, but the interviews with the members are in German, which takes away allot of momentum, trying to watch the footage and read English subtitles at the same time. And yes this film was basically footage based on thier 2010-2012 retirement tour, that they eventually ended up cancelling retirement .This could have been a great history film for hardcore longtime Scorps fans like myself, that waited for years to see a docu film on them , but instead , it's just a small basic history sourrounded by current ineup footage, the World Wide LIve vhs that was released in 1985, was far more interesting of a film to see, however if they were trying to recreate that same feel that the WWL film had upon it's release, then they missed. All in all it's ok to watch via streaming or renting, but if you're a hardcore fan, this DVD is not worth the purchase.",1448668800,16,1704,4.5537459283387625
7433628,5,B015EHCJ66,Excellent DVD!  Scorpions ROCK!  Loved the quick delivery through Amazon too! ,1448668800,,78,5.909090909090909
7433629,2,B015EHCJ66,Scorpions have such a rich rock n roll history; 'Forever and A Day simply didn't do the band justice. The film comes off more as a glrofied TV special than a documentary. I don't know the director's work but his work here isn't on the level of let's say Sam Dunn who has done superb work with RUSH and Alice Cooper on their documtaries. The other shortcoming of 'Forever and A Day' is the fact that it's in German then it's in English----the over all flow is continuously disrupted as a result. It's worth seeing once----I just wish I would 'rented' or streamed a copy than bought a hard copy.,1448582400,,593,4.4
7433630,4,B015EHCJ66,"The hard rock band Scorpions are best known in America for several hits in the 1980s, particularly the metal anthem Rock You Like a Hurricane. What people might not know is that by the time the German rock legends had those hits the band had already existed for nearly two decades. In 2015, Scorpions became one of the few rock bands to cross the half-century mark as a performing group, like the Rolling Stones and the Beach Boys. The new documentary Scorpions  Forever and a Day provides an in-depth look at the bands five decade history as one of the most popular rock bands in the world.

Though Scorpions were founded by teenage guitarist Rudolf Schenker in 1965, Scorpions  Forever and a Day glosses over the bands earliest years and really begins when singer Klaus Meine joined the band in 1969, which was followed by the bands first album Lonesome Crow in 1972. The main focus of the documentary is the bands Farewell Tour in 2012, with pieces of the bands most significant years weaved into the narrative. The documentary also touches upon the bands few troubles, such as the groups creative lull in the late 1990s and the bands relationship with its German fans, which was not always strong.

Perhaps the highlight of the documentary is how it demonstrates just how international the bands fanbase is. In fact, Scorpions played a minor role in the end of the Cold War, and even Mikhail Gorbachev is interviewed for this documentary. Another major politician who speaks about the influence of Scorpions on Eastern Europe is boxer-turned-politician Vitali Klitschko.

One of the questions Scorpions  Forever and a Day weighs in on is when its the right time for a rock band to hang it up. As the documentary details, Scorpions intended to end their run with their final concert in Munich on December 17, 2012. Its not a spoiler though to point out that Scorpions are still touring. So what happened? Schenker, Meine and the other members of the band discuss why the farewell tour turned into one of the longest on-going good-byes in rock history.

Scorpions  Forever and a Day is a must for all Scorpions fans. In particular, American fans will likely be surprised to find out how popular Scorpions remain all around the world even five decades since Schenker formed the first lineup. With excellent concert footage and vintage clips, it might not even give you as much of a sting as you're looking for. Thankfully, there are plenty of live Scorpions Blu-rays and DVDs to give you more.",1448409600,4,2494,4.783720930232558

7433644,5,B015EHCJ66,"Katja Von Garniers documentary contains a satisfying array of material, moving from the modern day goodbye tour and contemporary reflection, to vintage performance clips and older interviews. The interviews go into great depth on the cultural implications of a German band that sing in English. Much of the film is in German, with English subtitles.

Of most interest to me was guitarist and founding member Rudolf Schenker speaking to the decision of the band to jump on the 80s metal rocket: Here is something new. Here is something that wasn't built on ancient pillars. It was something completely new, and we were part of it. In post-war Germany, experiencing an economic boom, the time was right for the Scorpions, which would carry the banner for a new Germany. Klaus Meine says the decision to sing in English was an attempt to escape our Germanness.

The Scorps were ubiquitous but they came at us mostly from our American cultural connections. The title (taken from the song) of the documentary Forever and a Day is a clue that the Scorps gang are concerned about their legacy. They made a lot of money, but what did it all mean? One of the best party metal bands of the 80s, the Scorpions also toured in the USSR, willingly losing money in order to do so. They also attempted to reset perception of Germany, and they made some pretty killer tunes that will have a place on FM radio for all time. Forever and a Day is a must for Scorps fans and will be of interest in to anyone who survived the era.",1451692800,,1508,4.602230483271375
7433645,3,B015EHCJ66,"Scorpions: Forever and A Day doesnt just chronicle the five decade-plus history of one of the worlds most seminal rock bands, all the way through their worldwide farewell tour, the DVD shows the tolls and rigors the music industry can have on a band and its members. Some of the highlights of Scorpions: Forever and A Day include the band members at clearly their most vulnerable  from Klaus Meine discussing his marriage to Pawel Maciwoda opening up about the loss of his mother. And thats exactly what you want from a documentary such as Scorpions: Forever and A Day  its damn real and often gritty, just as the music industry can often be. The fact that the film is in German with English subtitles subtracts a bit from the overall picture as does the fact that it doesnt follow a succinct chronological timeline (not to mention the lack of any real bonus content). Still, theres more to like than naught here on Scorpions: Forever and A Day. Director Katja von Garnier does a great job of capturing the pure essence of the bands 2010 Sting In the Tail tour, including loads of nice behind-the-scenes and live footage, as well as interviews with Michail Gorbatschow, Michael Schenker and Don Dokken, among others, including KISSs Paul Stanley. All in all, Scorpions: Forever and A Day is pretty easy viewing (its only 100 minutes), one that fans of the band and fans of rock music in general really, should flock to.",1451260800,2,1419,4.717741935483871

That wacken festival reunion dvd  with Uli & Michael would have been great except the audio was horrible. I was a huge fan in the early days. I liked the music 80""s-90s but the last years have been pretty bad. They been rehashing the same music DVDs with different titles.
