5657181,3,B00BN3DVO0,"I've always found Chuck's movies enjoyable. Nothing approaching high art, but enjoyable. These are the blu-ray versions, and as such I look for high quality. What I found in this case was graininess and mono soundtracks. For when these were filmed, I guess I can't expect much more. So, I give them a passable rating.",1374537600,,317,4.781818181818182

5657183,5,B00BN3DVO0,Like i said before wish  we could get free shipping to Canada. The price was a lot cheaper buying from you than i could have bought single. Than in some cases on some movies i bought i had to pay import tax on some i was refunded.,1373846400,,230,3.893617021276596

8571345,5,B00BN3DVO0,"Great Action filled package. I saw all the movies in 2 days, I enjoyed seeing one of the great action movies hero in his best moments at his top condition. And although some of the plots have a dose on hard to believe secuences, all in all is a very enjoyable set of movies. I am glad I can also show this to my children when they turn 18 for a nice action film.",1402531200,,362,3.9054054054054053
8571346,1,B00BN3DVO0,"Can you believe 7 knuckleheads actually gave this mess of films 5 stars? Chuck's acting is much better now in his infomercials. Way back in the 1970s, grindhouse producers were fishing around for a white guy who could put a white face on chop-socky, and maybe steal some of Bruce Lee's righteous thunder.  Unfortunately, the white guy they settled on was Chuck. I hear Chuck coached Steve McQueen in karate, and a few other Hollywood notables as well. Somehow, two-buck Chuck ingratiated himself and kissed enough butt-crack to get a career going.  He then became multi-million buck Chuck. As Don King says: ""Only in America!"" The only one of these 5 films that is good for a laugh is Lone Wolf McQuade. At least, that has a bizarro David Carradine at his sleaziest throwing loopy crescent kicks, and grinning sadistically. Plus it has luscious Barbara Carrera.",1395273600,,861,4.890410958904109
8571347,5,B00BN3DVO0,I bought these for a co-worker who is a huge fan of Chuck Norris! He was thrilled with the videos and had a Chuck Norris marathon that weekend.,1383004800,,143,4.142857142857143
8571348,3,B00BN3DVO0,These blu-rays are region free which is good news for Chuck's European fans. The movie Braddock Missing In Action III  which has not been released in The U.S.A yet is available from Amazon's German site but it is region 2 locked.,1377993600,,229,4.585365853658536
8571349,4,B00BN3DVO0,For those Chuck Norris fans this is a must have set. Love them! Movies like this don't seem to be produced these days.,1376956800,,118,4.173913043478261
8571350,4,B00BN3DVO0,"Is he a good actor - not really.  But if you enjoy any of his 'war/action' movies I'm sure you will enjoy this collection!!  My favorite is Lone Wolf McQuade - bot the MIA series is a good set of movies and I also enjoyed Code of Silence and Delta Force.  I probably wouldn't have paid more than the $25 I spent on these five movies, but if you can pick it up cheap (how can you beat $5 a movie on blu-ray?)  I would definitely pick it up if I was you.

Of course, it doesn't compare to the 'new' movies with all the special effects but then again, it's not supposed to as most of these movies were made around 30 years ago!!",1376352000,,625,3.968
