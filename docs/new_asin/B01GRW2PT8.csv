7767044,5,B01GRW2PT8,Now this is a set for completists! The whole Original Series plus the Animated Series and the original cast movies. I think it is worth it for the Animated Series alone!! I already have the Original Series on blu ray so here's hoping I can get the Animated Series on blu ray in a standalone set.,1465516800,18,295,4.285714285714286

7767048,5,B01GRW2PT8,"This set is gorgeous. You can really tell that love and care was put into it. At the time of buying it only cost $92. That's a steal for the Original Series, the Animated Series, and TOS Film Collection all boxed together on blu ray.

TOS is timeless. You probably already have an idea of what the premise is, so focusing on the picture and sound quality, I've never seen this show look so impressive before. There isn't going to be a better alternative if you want to own this show and it's accompanying media.",1516147200,,511,4.378947368421053

7767050,5,B01GRW2PT8,I had to rebuy this set today after having this same set for over a year because one of the third season discs cracked.  Aside from that I will vouch for the fact that this is indeed THE best Star Trek collection on the market,1512345600,2,226,4.022222222222222
7767051,5,B01GRW2PT8,"I am only halfway through the first season, but am amazed at the quality of work performed on these blu-ray discs. The color and clarity restoration is superb. I have found only a few scenes where artifacts appear on the screen, and they are noticeable only because everything else is pristine. The same can be said of the audio.

A few technical issues: there is a pop-up menu option that allows the user to switch screen angles, which serves to switch between original graphics and re-created graphics that use existing technology but are made in the old style to match the rest of the episodes. That is, the graphic detail does not look like that in the newer movies. It is visually pleasing and supportive of the story lines. The problem is that the switching is available ONLY when the new graphic scenes are being displayed. So, you cannot switch angles except while those graphics are appearing, and there is no way to know when those graphics are showing! It's a catch-22. Obviously, the exterior scenes of the Enterprise are all new, but there are interior scenes that are sometimes new as well, whether it's a background graphic or a time display on a console. It would be nice/interesting to have a split-screen display option to show both versions simultaneously.

[UPDATE at end of paragraph] Secondly, on some of the discs, the user is granted special ""Starfleet Access,"" to selected episodes that brings up a picture-in-picture display showing things like pre- and post-restoration. It also brings up picture-in-picture of staff apparently describing what they did technically to the scenes, but it's impossible to tell on my display since there is no audio selection to hear what they are saying. Even under the ""Audio"" options, there are no selections for ""director's notes"" or ""English 3"" or anything that might play the audio notes. Sad. So very sad. [UPDATE: after searching the internet on these issues, others noted that the player has to enable ""secondary audio"" to hear the overlaid audio. I have a Sony BDP-BX370 blu-ray player. On this player, the ""BD Audio MIX Setting"" needs to be set to ""On."" Doing so mixes the overlaid audio into the output. Yes, I now hear the extra audio.]

Having said all of that, I first saw Star Trek episodes as re-runs on a black and white television. I haven't seen most of the shows in 40 years or so. I had forgotten some episodes entirely, and others are just amazingly wonderful to see in fully restored color. I had no idea that the insignia on the shirts was different based on profession, e.g., science, medical, command, etc. Also, in the earliest of episodes, I don't think that they had much in the way of air conditioning: in almost all shots, all of the faces continuously show beads of sweat. In some of the later episodes, they seem to have gotten the overheating of actors under control.

Mr. Spock gets special notes: in the earliest of episodes, they seem to have experimented with the color of his face, which in some episodes is downright yellow. In other episodes, he has typically ""human"" skin color. Also, Mr. Spock's cadence changed from the earliest shows where he sounds like an officer giving commands on a submarine (through odd voice inflection), but later takes on a more ""normal"" voice. Of course, Mr. Spock's ears and eyebrows changed a lot from the earliest episodes (eyebrows were almost vertical and thick as caterpillars in the earliest episodes). Also, my memory had only one instance of Mr. Spock showing emotions. How wrong I was: Mr. Spock shows emotions in most of the episodes (at least the early ones). In some of them, he downright laughs/smiles, but in almost all episodes, he shows a slight grin, especially at the end of the shows when he banters with Captain Kirk and Dr. McCoy.

There also appears to be much more romance than I remember from 40 years ago. In almost every episode, there is romance for Captain Kirk. I remember that he was a ladies' man, but it's almost every single episode...even with Yeoman Rand.

I suppose that the best part of my journey through these shows is that I now see them through adult eyes (not the pre-teen and teenager eyes of my first viewing). I now see all of the nuances and moral values that are embedded in the series. This show was not just a science fiction series: it was a reflection of a generation of hopes and dreams. I thoroughly enjoyed (and am still enjoying) my romp through the past.",1511136000,13,4441,4.738680465717982

I had never seen a single episode of The Animated Series and was happy to see it wasn't as childish as I expected. It's Star Trek with out the limits of budgets.

The 3 seasons (they should have made more) are in a large plastic container along with the animated series. I tried to take pictures of each little thing so you can see what I'm talking about. The series and animated series big plastic holder comes out as you will see in a picture. This actually helps a lot as it was hard to get the discs out. I had to be careful not to break them! On each episode of the original series you have the option to watch the old original or the enhanced version which is awesome. There are a lot of added extras on them as well.

The movies come in a box to themselves. The little pin was loose in its box but if you can tell in my picture, I just taped it to the box and it's fine.

The mini posters are amaze balls! The are on a sturdy card stock and just beautiful!

7767107,5,B01GRW2PT8,"I've been a fan of star trek for a long time. Back since star trek : the motion picture showed on HBO. I watched it repeatedly many times when it was showing. The TOS episodes . I didn't grow up with,  but i saw reruns on cable tv. The star trek animation, i grew up with. It was shown as saturday morning cartoons on tv. In the 70s - 80s. It later showed on cable tv on nickelodeon channel. That was when i watched it alot. No matter how many times i watch a classic like this, it doesn't get old. Its as good as it first aired on TV.  Lets dive into the package -
  Inside the box. Are the bluray discs in slip cases. One contains discs 3 seasons of  the  star trek original series. The second one contains discs from the six stsr trek movies. Each disc has art work on them according to their respective category.  I liked the way they did that . Paying attention to detail.  Alot of the material in this set has been remastered.  The six movies have extended footage in them. The added feature is a star trek 50th anniversary pin.  And a set of  post cards with art work of the six star trek movies.

Still have the VCR movies somewhere, have never had the series or animated series. So for someone like us, this is AWESOME! I have seen lots of comments about how it's not the Director's Cuts or Expanded Cuts and therefore is ""poor quality,"" but that is from people who A) are basing their reviews on other people's reviews and/or B) are not even going that far. I wouldn't bother listening to them. Instead just ask yourself those two questions:

1) Are you a Star Trek Original Series Fanatic? You need to be at least a fanatic to spend this much money on all of this anyway. There are far better places to put your money if you just ""sort of"" like the show.

2) Have you NOT spent a ton on previous runs of the shows and movies 1-6? If you already have, unless you are still stuck in the VCR days like me and at least have the DVD's, this might not be a good run for you. Maybe. There is also putting money in places in the industry that we want to see more of the same. This is voting with your money, you might say. So there are a number of other reasons to buy this even if you have already spent a ton on Paramount Star Trek movie and show stuff.

7767130,3,B01GRW2PT8,"Let me explain.

I bought it with the idea that it was the only way to get the animated ST. This was before I knew they were going to release the animated shows separately later towards the Xmas holiday. Anyhow, the price at $129.99 on sale isn't so bad, considering that I found out that the animated trek was going to be about $40 or more. Also, having a few new special features was good, though just a little slim IMO.

But the packaging itself is only so-so. The outer box looks great, but the way they packaged the pin, and the series shows within it is horrible. The pin does not stay in its space very well.

First, the case where all of the series shows are put has a major flaw or two. The discs are almost impossible to get out of their respective slots [the hubs are too strong and only have two holding pins instead of four and make extraction very difficult. It almost caused me to break one of the discs!! Why Paramount didn't just used the same Blu-ray cases they had for the original release of the Original Series is beyond me. It would have made better sense, especially considering  this is the way the movies were housed.

Second, I would have preferred [as would, I'm sure, many fans would've] that the seasons to be separated instead of being lumped together as one giant set of discs which unfortunately becomes rather unwieldy at 24 plus discs. I will say that I took the Series episode discs and put them in cases quite similar to the ones from the original release and put them on my shelves. This way I know which discs went with what season.

These are my gripes, and I hope the package designers of the sets will read this, and think just a little bit more about such things. Lord knows that the price for this warranted it.",1475366400,36,1754,4.348623853211009

7767135,1,B01GRW2PT8,"This is not out but I will tell you why this is not on my Christmas wish list: no extended movies. There are director's cuts of  some of the films. Wrath of Khan is nicely improved with a few added scenes, but The Motion Picture is, frankly, pretty damn good compared to both the original cut (which is in here). I have not bought any Blu Rays of any of the films because of this. I have idea why Paramount is doing this when they could actually put both cuts of these film on the same disc, like Cose Encounters has the original cut, the special edition, and the final directors cut on the one disc.

Before you say, ""the Motion Picture was not finished in HD,"" bollocks. The people who made it created all of their projects in HD and used an HD master. They wanted to show it theatrically but Paramount, at the time, did not want to pay for the added rendering time so it was rendered in SD. However, the people who made it have said they have all the projects archived and all they need to do is load them up and render it at HD... no other work needed except to have some computer crunch it. Worse, the other extended versions all have HD masters!

CBS Paramount- you piss me off. When you give me the goods I will buy it, until then... forget it.",1473465600,8,1251,4.182572614107884
7767146,5,B01GRW2PT8,"My only regrets with this purchase [pre-order], is that it is not in 4K HDR.  For a series about the future, Trek releases seem to always fall behind the times. The original DVD release (for example), came out around the same time hi-def blu-rays hit the market.  Fast-forward a decade later as 4K blu-rays with HDR are hitting the market, and here we go again.

That said, I'm still getting these.  I have been waiting for a box set like this, everything from TOS, for 20 years. No way I'm passing up on it now that I have it.  I'll just have to buy it again in a few years, when Paramount re-releases it in 4K HDR. Until that day, I will love and cherish this set like it were one of my children - maybe more than my children.

Besides, word coming out of several AV sites are saying that Microsoft apparently put a very high end upscaler/de-interlacer chipset in their newly released Xbox One S.  I keep hearing stories of super clean upscales from this device, from every source: including video games, movies, and streaming video.  With upscales from 720p, 900p, and 1080p, to 4K, with little to zero artifacts.  If true, then amazing. As most cheap upscalers (like the ones found in almost every TVs and blu-ray player on the market), make a complete mess of things, and wind up actually degrading video quality in the process.  So if the stories about the scaler in the Xbox One S are true (and several relyable sources say they are), then that's just one more thing I'll joyfully purchase this fall to enjoy my 50th Anniversary Trek with. It's still no HDR - for that Paramount would have to had encoded HDR directly on the Trek discs.  But at least, an artifact-free 4K upscale of this boxset, so that I can enjoy it on my recently purchased 4K set, will do perfectly fine . . . you know, until Paramount finally gets around to re-releasing this set in 4K HDR in a few years.",1472601600,12,1884,4.431884057971015
7767147,5,B01GRW2PT8,"50 years after cancellation of Star Trek TOS... The stars of the tv show have been faithful to the fans with appearances at sci-fi conventions and electronic store openings to name a few. Also the stars charity work has helped millions of people, who needed help in some form or fashion like the Red Cross.  I have been discouraged by so call fans making reviews on something they don't even have yet !  I'm a over hill Trekkie but not some Trekkie that's lost his mind.  I had Star Trek TOS on video tape back in the VCR's days and I slowly conform to innovation and technology.  The first Star Trek DVD collection I owned was the 2004 set.  The old DVDs came in a nice  hard plastic case representing the  seasons plus colors of duties yellow, blue, and red with chrome writing and Delta shield proclaiming STAR TREK The Original Series !
Some may remember, you were on the bridge with this set, which let you select different options for your episode. Enough said on that, but ever since then I've seen so many box sets that I had to pick and choose what I really wanted.. Example: I purchased the Remaster Edition of Star Trek TOS which stated brilliantly remaster enhanced with visual effects for standard DVD players.  Again reviews or more like complaints that was not favorable with this release. This one had you in the transporter room selecting options for your episode. It came in a semi-attractive plastic see-through with yellow, blue, and red distinguishing the three seasons 1966-1969 that they were on CBS television. Technology advance and along the way, I upgraded to Blu-ray and I purchased another Star Trek TOS this time on Blu-ray.  Wow, high definition and nice colors almost like you could reach out and touch them kind of thing for real but again more bad reviews from so call fans. Come down to Earth will you people?  FYI - I have all the Star Trek movies on Blu-ray now, why would I be interested in a new box set you wonder?  Because I am a fan - Trekkie or Trekker and only thing you need to know is that I love Star Trek TOS as much as the next person reading these reviews. We all know that Paramont and CBS have made several, mistakes with box sets. But there is a option !  You don't have to buy it ! You can save your money for something else. Go buy a copy of Galaxy Quest on Blu-ray-that should lift your spirits - That's a joke but I have that too in my Star Trek archives.  I'm going to buy this box set for its collectibility.  I'm not even going to open it to be honest with you all because I have so much Star Trek to watch now !  Final word, don't base your buying preference on other peoples reviews or agendas...  Basically it comes down to if you really want it or not as a fan. Check my photos - I purchased everyone of them on Amazon and I'm glad I did !

7767149,3,B01GRW2PT8,"I would love to buy this Box Set, but other then the images of the product, , there is no list of the movies or the series episodes or special discs.

Please list out the movies included, the series involved, and any special discs.  I would be more incline to buy this.",1470009600,16,269,4.153846153846154
7767150,5,B01GRW2PT8,"This is a great looking box set. The only reason it is currently getting mixed reviews is because Trek fans are tired of all the options. They complain when we don't have Trek on the air, and they complain when Trek IS on the air. They complain when there is another box set, and they complain when a new box set hasn't been announced in awhile.

Point is, if you don't want another box set, you don't have to buy/comment on it. If you are upset that something better than what you currently have is being released, welcome to the real world of marketing and merchandise sales. Either learn to be patient, learn to be content, or pay up and get what you really want.

Again, beautiful box set for the 50th Anniversary of Star Trek. I will be recommending this to all my Trek friends.",1468886400,43,783,4.3561643835616435

Really people this is more than annoying. Unless you have a preview copy, which you should mention, DONT talk trash about things you could not possibly know..I would love for this product to be wonderful. I have posted a positive review to try to even out the ""FALSE NEGATIVE"" reviews. Since the product isn't released until September 6, 2016 please disregard any reviews prior to release.

7767152,5,B01GRW2PT8,"The is the nicest Star Trek Boxset to date! What we have here, is the first true Star Trek Boxset ever released! What we've seen in the past, has merely been in the individual seasons basically taped together into a bundle. There was nothing new added, and nothing special about it. Never before have we ever had a combination set like what we see here. This is Star Trek The Original Series, and Star Trek The Animated Series and Star Trek 1-6 (films). This is the true 100% Star Trek The Complete Original Series. In the past, the movies and the tv series have always been kept separated in box sets. The Animated Series was always kept separate from the Original Series and has been considered it's own separate show. This is the first time we've ever had a real box set before, and I for one am very excited about that. And yes, it's true that most of the special features will be the same old thing, but it does look like there will still be some new features that are exclusive to this set. And even if you already have the previous releases, it's likely that this set being a 50th Anniversary set, will not be around forever. It's possible that it could become rare at some point, and end up being a very nice piece to have. And they've given us some special movie posters that look great! In addition to giving the discs their own great looking artwork, from what I can tell in the promo photo. While the boxset I would prefer to have, would be one massive box set that is the entire original franchise (Pre-JJ Trek) 1966-2005 all together in big special set. That would make me really happy. But I am willing to settle for this for the time being. I would also like to add, for those of us who want to see Deep Space Nine and Voyager on Blu-ray, buying these new releases could potentially help that effort. Sadly, when these new releases come out and don't sell well, that discourages CBS from going further. And we want to keep encouraging them as much as possible to continue giving us more, until we truly have the entire Star Trek series from start to finish in HD. It's a shame that so many reviews so far have been so negative. I want to encourage everyone to think about what Star Trek means to them. Particularly long term. This will be a great set to own later on down the road!",1466899200,56,2297,4.356643356643357
7767153,3,B01GRW2PT8,"IT'S WRONG TO SAY THAT THIS SET IS COMPLETELY A CYNICAL CASH GRAB. THE HD REMASTERING OF TAS IS TRULY A NICE 50th GIFT (I FOR ONE NEVER THOUGHT PARAMOUNT, GIVEN THEIR LONGTIME RECORD OF DISAPPOINTING BOTH STAR TREK AND ITS FANS, WOULD EVER MAKE THE EFFORT, AND BTW IVE HEARD THE STORY OF EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED...THEY HAD TO BE CLUED IN...)
HOWEVER ITS TRUE THAT EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE SET IS SAME OLD, SAME OLD, THEREFORE USELESS UNLESS YOU'VE BEEN UNDER A ROCK AND HAVEN'T BOUGHT ANYTHING BEFORE. I'M HOPING THEY JUST DIDN'T HAVE TIME AND WILL GET AROUND TO REMASTERING THE FILMS SOON.

I WILL WAIT FOR TAS TO BE RELEASED IN SEPARATE PACKAGING. IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN--FAIRLY SOON-- THEN WE WILL HAVE REAL CAUSE TO DESPISE PARAMOUNT.",1466553600,15,736,4.6183206106870225

8763414,1,B01GRW2PT8,"I am giving this one star because the description in the sellers posted video is misleading. The video misrepresents what's in this box set. I assumed that this included Star Trek Next Generation as well as the original series. The video opens with Capt Kirk, then three seconds in, you see Capt. Jean-Luc Picard. One minute and twelve seconds in, they talk about Next Generation as well. Nothing in the product description indicates that this box set is for the original series only. Now I will have to spend well over another $100 to be able to complete the set.",1530748800,,564,4.65

8763416,5,B01GRW2PT8,"I'll be clear ... I was never a huge TOS fan.  I grew up on TNG and DS9, later coming in to VOY and ENT.  I've seen all six original films many times.  I've seen many episodes of TOS.  I even had the Stardate film collection that had the first ten films in one box (the white and blue box).  I lost that set during a move.  When this set came on sale I decided to splurge.

What you get is TOS, remastered with and without special effects upgrades, TAS (the animated series on Blu Ray), all six films (including The Wrath of Khan in two versions - the original Blu-Ray release and the newly released Director's Cut), and a big documentary (on a bonus disc) that fully doucments Star Trek's journey from television to film.

The packaging is great, in my opinion, but I would advise this is not a set for a casual fan.",1524960000,,817,4.1923076923076925
