2700897,5,B000L9VL2G,"I love watching these mysteries, especially between basketball & football dead season.  I plan to purchase more Agatha Christie.  I can't wait to get Prime Suspect also.  I ordered the complete series.  The only suggestion I have is that Amazon make available Poirot-The Complete Collection (all 11 series).  This DVD is already available in Europe.  I hope we can get it here in the States soon.",1267056000,2,396,4.924242424242424
2700898,5,B000L9VL2G,"Just to clear up a point that concerned other reviewers (and possibly other owners or potential buyers):

Only nine of the twelve Miss Marple stories starring Joan Hickson are included because video rights to the other three are controlled by (and DVDs have been released by) another company.  The same is true for the early (one-hour) Poirot stories and the most recent movies; this product contains the 12 films that A&E has the video rights to.

Someday all the rights may belong to a single company, in which case we may finally see a ""complete"" Hickson Marple or a ""complete"" Suchet Poirot, but not before then.",1264204800,186,616,4.7924528301886795

2700900,5,B000L9VL2G,"A&E Video pitches this as ""2 sensational sleuths, 1 extraordinary writer"".  If you paraphrase the words, you have the description given to Horatio Hornblower in the making of special shown with the first (Midshipman) series.  Which shows as they are aging, A&E's vocabulary is slowly degrading.  As to the DVDs in this set, this is nothing more than a reissued megaset of the 12 feature length Poirots shown by A&E in the early 2000s and 9 of the 12 Classic Miss Marples (with Joan Hickson) during the 1980s on PBS and later rerun on A&E.  Both series originating on British TV of course.  As they are not complete, you will still need the following to complete your collections:  The Warner Home Video 3 pack of Miss Marple, the 2 Acorn Media Classic Collections or their newly released counterparts in colored boxes with 3 or 4 discs which includes a new set which has 2 of 4 newly made Poirots in 2008 (the other 2 are not out in America as yet but they are in England if you have a multi region player).  Suffice it to say, nothing new here for those who bought any of the older copies.  But if you haven't then get the best deal (which this mega set might be for a start) you can but remember this mega set is incomplete.",1252195200,53,1226,4.393805309734513

Their performances are so good I cannot accept any other actor's portrayal of these beloved sleuths as genuine. Although Agatha Christie's plots can be a bit formulaic, Suchet and Hickson make every episode a joy to watch. The supporting actors are also very good. If you are into detective stories and love plot twists, this anthology is for you.",1408492800,,501,4.905882352941177

2700961,4,B000L9VL2G,"Overall I am happy with this purchase. It popped up while viewing something else. I remember how I used to like the series so I ordered it. Kind of slower moving then I remember, therefore only 4 stars. Still happy with my purchase and will watch every one.(in between Midsomer Murders) The price was definitely a factor for purchasing so rapidly. I had no problem with the quality of the films.",1405296000,,395,4.577464788732394

2700966,4,B000L9VL2G,"We love Poirot & Marple and it's a great collection, but if you already own some of their mysteries, this set might not include many new ones for you.
Poirot:  Murder of Roger Ackroyd,  Lord Edgeware Dies,  Murder in Mesopotamia,  Evil under the Sun,  Death on Nile, Sad Cypress,  The Hollow,  5 Little Pigs,  Mystery of Blue Train;  Taken at the Flood;  After the Funeral,  Cards on the Table.
Marple:  Caribbean Mystery;  Mirror Crack'd from Side to Side;  Sleeping Murder;  4:50 from Paddington;  Moving Finger;  At Bertram's Hotel;  Murder at Vicarage;  Nemesis;  They do it with Mirrors.

but if you don't have these, this set is great!",1402272000,13,641,4.803738317757009
2700967,5,B000L9VL2G,"He does such a perfect job of mincing around! I liked Miss Limon (sp?) his secretary also. Really enjoyed this collection. Makes me want to see Suchet in some other role. I've so firmly connected him to Poirot I wonder how I'd disconnect him to be someone else.
Miss Maple is a bit heavy going but that is Christie's fault not the actors. I do get tired of hearing Miss Marple denigrate herself. It's so ridiculous when clearly she is the one solving the mysteries. Did Christie mean it as pure satire? Whatever it's grating on my nerves. A little of Miss Marple goes a long way!",1401235200,,579,4.420560747663552

2700969,5,B000L9VL2G,"I bought it to give it as a gift and it was just a success.  The collection is full of interest and most of all, based on Agatha Chisty's stories.",1399852800,,146,3.8666666666666667
2700970,4,B000L9VL2G,I've always been a fan Agatha Christies work. This collection gives you a great cross section of her best characters. The stories are well done and the characters are perfect.,1398297600,,175,4.866666666666666
2700981,4,B000L9VL2G,"Well worth the money for those who are familiar with the two series.  For the unfamiliar, the stories generally have several characters to keep in mind.  In Miss Marple many times wondering who will get bumped off is almost equal to who did it.  In many Poirot stories one gets a good view of pre War II upper class flinging their money and shallow character around.  The setting and accruements are faithful to the time period.",1396396800,,428,4.592105263157895
2700982,5,B000L9VL2G,"I absolutely love all the Agatha Christie works. Every lady that has played Miss Marple has brought someting to the role. Of course, David Suchet is the true Poirot!",1394496000,,165,4.724137931034483
2700983,5,B000L9VL2G,"My husband and I both love Agatha Christie mysteries, so we thought we'd give this anthology a try.  Well we sat down and watched these immediately over the course of several evenings.  They are delightful.  David Suchet is my favorite Poirot by far, and Joan Hickson is perfect as Miss Marple; very serious and not at all dowdy.  There are 12 Poirot stories and 9 Marple stories included in this collection.  It is a wonderful bargain for the price, and provides hours of enjoyment.  Highly recommended for all Christie fans!!!",1394323200,,528,4.811111111111111
2700984,5,B000L9VL2G,Would use this seller again.  Package arrived on time and packed well.  The quality of the DVD is excellent and of course the stories are wonderful.  I can watch them over and over again and never get tired of them.,1394236800,,215,4.325

2700986,5,B000L9VL2G,Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot together in a boxed set... you can't get much better than this.  David Suchet is the ultimate Hercule Poirot and Joan Hickson does a very good Miss Marple.,1392076800,,186,4.636363636363637

2700988,5,B000L9VL2G,"A substantial DVD set for the Agatha Christie/British period TV production fan.
Of course David Suchet is incomparable as Poirot. These are some of the movie-length, later A&E productions, without his earlier cast of supporting characters. But still worth the price of admission.
The Marple mysteries are well produced and feature the very authentic Miss Marple portrayed by Joan Hickson.",1389139200,,388,5.483333333333333

2701001,5,B000L9VL2G,Fabulous DVD set. I'm so thrilled to have this in my new collection. As many may have noticed there is nothing to watch on TV anymore. I've started a personal collection of programming and Poirot is a MUST have. The fact Marple is a bonus collection in here makes this set even better! Hopefully someday 1 company will own the rights to the entire series so there can truly be a complete set! Until then though this is fabulous,1387584000,,427,4.417721518987341
2701002,4,B000L9VL2G,I have had this set for some time and have many Poirot DVDs and Blurays. I pulled out the  Evil Under the Sun DVD and it would not play. Other DVDs play ok. So what happened. I know I have played it before. Do DVDs wear out like VHS tapes use to? Most disappointing.,1387152000,,266,3.925925925925926

Miss Marple (Joan Hickson) who I consider the best portrayal and Poirot (David Suchet) who does an excellent job.  So you get the best of the best at an affordable price.  DVDs you will watch again and again.  The production is awesome perfect picture and surround sound.  I am very pleased.,1372636800,,409,4.386666666666667

Since the titles are not advertised in the item description, I was so hoping that Miss Marple's ""Nemesis"" would be included -- and it is!  Haven't played any of them yet, and there are more Poirot than Marple, but I know I am going to be quite pleased.  It's going to be a delightful Thanksgiving weekend!

For those interested, these are the titles included in the set:

Poirot:  The Murder of Roger Ackroyd; Lord Edgware Dies; Murder in Mesopotamia; Evil Under the Sun; Death on the Nile; Sad Cypress; The Hollow; Five Little Pigs; The Mystery of the Blue Train; Taken at the Flood; After the Funeral; Cards on the Table.

Miss Marple:  A Caribbean Mystery; The Mirror Crack'd From Side to Side; Sleeping Murder; 4:50 from Paddington; The Moving Finger; At Bertram's Hotel; Murder at the Vicarage; Nemesis; They Do It with Mirrors.

Initially intended to be a Christmas gift, I just couldn't wait and gave it to my son early. We've been enjoying it very much on nights when TV isn't interesting. The set was a bargain on the Gold Box deal, but given it provides hours and hours of entertainment, is a good value regardless. Other reviewers have listed all the episodes, so I'll skip that in my review.
