6264451,4,B00IIC4PLC,This 1939 classic that was later remade as AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER by the same director is still in need of a better transfer though this edition is better than a number of other releases. The problem is the film went into Public Domain and there are a number of very poor DVD copies on the market. The Moving Picture Archive release is the best that I have seen so far and its not likely that the money will be spent to put out a restored versions of this very fine film.,1430956800,2,470,4.119565217391305
6264452,5,B00IIC4PLC,"Excellent movie.  it's an earlier version of An Affair to Remember which is always a tear jerker.  I like having both versions and enjoy both of them.  I also enjoy watching ""Imitation of Life"" in its earlier version and then the later version.  I am a  classic movie junky.",1428710400,,274,4.510204081632653
6264453,5,B00IIC4PLC,As others have said this is the best print to emerge of this classic love story . The print is almost flawless and allows one to appreciate the artistry and charisma of Boyer and Dunne. Whilst I like the remake An Affair To Remember it could have benefited from the tight script employed in this the original version. Another plus is Maria Ouspenskaya. An asset to any movie and this is a great movie.,1417219200,4,401,4.4324324324324325
6264454,5,B00IIC4PLC,"With this film in the public domain for so many years, each new bargain home video release has been distinguished only by how much worse it was than the last. Finally here is a version that is worth the price of admission. It's not perfect but it is vastly superior to every other release of this gem.",1409961600,7,301,4.298245614035087
6264455,5,B00IIC4PLC,"Beautifully restored film by The Moving Picture Archive. Excellent audio and video quality make this film a great watch for the entire family.

A great classic love story! French painter Michel (Charles Boyer) meets Terry (Irene Dunne) aboard a cruise ship. Despite being engaged to other people, they fall in love. They make an appointment to meet six months later at the Empire State Building. However, tragedy strikes; Terry is struck by a car, and is crippled. Terry doesn't contact Michel, letting him think the worst.

After they meet by accident at a theater, Michel visits Terry. He learns the truth, and professes his undying love for her, regardless of the prognosis that Terry may never walk again. A wonderful love story which is very poignant and touching.... Not to be missed.",1392681600,10,790,4.9772727272727275

8642258,5,B00IIC4PLC,"My wife and I are huge fans of classic films from the Golden Age of Hollywood. We have assembled a very large collection of these movies on DVD and spend most of what otherwise would be our television time enjoying them. One of the films we make it a point to see at least once or twice is year is the 1957 romance ""An Affair To Remember"" starring Cary Grant and Deborah Kerr. It was my mother's all-time favorite film. Until recently we had no idea that this was actually a remake of the 1939 film ""Love Affair"" starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne and directed by Leo McCarey. Since ""Love Affair"" was readily available at a very reasonable price on Amazon we decided to purchase it and check it out. We were not disappointed.

We discovered that ""Love Affair"" was every bit as charming as the Cary Grant-Deborah Kerr version of nearly two decades later. The chemistry between Boyer and Dunne is quite palpable from the opening scene. McCarey, who is also the co-author of this story, does a workmanlike job of directing ""Love Affair"". Be prepared to experience a roller-coaster of emotions along the way. Perhaps the most surprising thing about this film was Irene Dunne singing a tune called ""Sing My Heart"". What a gorgeous voice! We had no idea.

At just 88 minutes ""Love Story"" is about 30 minutes shorter than ""An Affair To Remember"". Yet it proves to be every bit enjoyable as ""An Affair To Remember"". Frankly I did not think that was possible. If you have not yet had the pleasure of seeing ""Love Affair"" I would strongly urge you to grab a copy while it is still available. I think you will find this a most worthy addition to your library of classic films. Highly recommended!",1494892800,,1689,4.552631578947368
8642259,2,B00IIC4PLC,Clarity was so-so but the audio was poor.  Also no subtitles.,1489968000,,61,4.545454545454546
8642260,5,B00IIC4PLC,"I love this rendition of this story I also own a copy of the Cary Grant, Debra Kerr version The Irene Dunne Charles Boyer is far better.",1475193600,,136,4.074074074074074
8642261,5,B00IIC4PLC,"A beautifully filmed sentimental love story starring Charles Boyer and Irene Dunne. Both actors wonderfully portray the lead characters.

The Empire State Building is the meeting point for these two lovers, who have met aboard a ship crossing the Atlantic. Although both are engaged to other people, they fall in love, and agree to meet in six months time after arriving in New York City. As Irene Dunne (Terry) approaches the Empire State Building for their rendezvous, tragedy strikes. What happens next and how will this story end? You must watch this romantic film to find out..

You will enjoy this film from beginning to end. It is a real classic about the enduring power of love. A classic which has stood the test of time!",1473206400,,730,4.785714285714286
8642262,5,B00IIC4PLC,"Loved this movie, obviously the original Love Affair movie!! Actors were incredible.",1461196800,,84,6.083333333333333
8642263,5,B00IIC4PLC,"This is the second time I purchase this film. The first time was through Alpha Video, which was a pretty good version in terms of visual quality. I bought this one because it promised a better restoration and I was pleased. Although the restoration is not up to HD or Blu-ray, the images are much clearer than the Alpha version. I do enjoy this film regardless of the quality of the image. Nevertheless, I am pleased by this restoration.

I don't give review of the content because it is in the Alpha version, and because other reviewers have done a good job at it. It's a great romance that starts aboard a ship and involves the Empire State Building (I'm not so sure if this is the first film to use the Empire as a place for romance). This was worth the price.",1446336000,5,763,4.335664335664336
