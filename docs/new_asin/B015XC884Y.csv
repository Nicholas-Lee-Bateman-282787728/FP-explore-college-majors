7453908,5,B015XC884Y,If you love Kevin Sorbo...and horses....this is a great family movie to see!,1453075200,,76,4.923076923076923
7453909,5,B015XC884Y,"This movie,about a girl and the father she never really knew,is very heartwarming and wonderful! Duke Williams,a former rodeo champion,welcomes Priscilla,the daughter he never got to know,to his ranch for the summer. After going to a rodeo,she decides she wants to compete in the barrel-racing. Duke is against that because of his own experience,including a bashed knee,which led to his retirement from the sport. Eventually,he agrees to let her,despite his reservations about it. The message of this movie is clear:Never let go of your dreams! Kevin Sorbo is fantastic as Duke and Sophie Bolen is great as Priscilla! I recommend this as a great family movie!",1452816000,5,659,5.226415094339623
7453910,2,B015XC884Y,Not good,1452729600,,8,3.5
7453911,1,B015XC884Y,oh my... besides Kevin Sorbo- who is good- it seems to be every other actor's first gig. we were actually laughing our heads off through most of it because of the script and pedestrian acting. Find another option... unless you have seen absolutely every other horse movie in the Universe.  my daughters had to approve this review and they think I am being far too generous. They are 12 and 13 and they say... two thumbs down. way down. sorry.,1452211200,2,442,4.525
7453912,5,B015XC884Y,Great Movie with a plot that still works in today's time.  Have faith in yourself and family.,1452038400,,93,4.470588235294118
7453913,5,B015XC884Y,"I realize that this film was a ""cakewalk"" for a talented actor like Kevin Sorbo, but there aren't many other actors who could have done such a fine job, here! This is a family-friendly movie about a ""high-society"" young girl who finds that being part of a family and pursuing her dreams are what she really wanted, all the time! I won't give away the ""mystery"" of her father's past, but she'll discover why he is initially against her getting involved with fancy horse riding or anything else of the kind.

Great for kids and adults, alike; teenage girls will especially love this story! I've ordered several DVDs for some of the girls in our family.",1450828800,,650,4.603448275862069

7453916,2,B015XC884Y,"Ok so I can get past poor acting.
But do your research!!! It's a kid/family movie everyone on a horse should be wearing a helmet!! The kids at the rodeo drugging horses is not wide spread in the real world. If they spent $75,000 on a hunter they would not be ""retraining"" it for barrels. And if you did it would be more then a few weeks.
You have a 14yr old and a 18+ yr old flirting. That's not family friendly it's weird.
They go back and forth in the horse being a girl or a boy.
And if she's supposed to be there for the summer why is it clearly fall?
And if the kid goes to boarding school why wouldn't she just stay there for summer?",1477612800,,639,3.9612403100775193

7453919,5,B015XC884Y,A very good family movie,1467072000,,24,4.0
7453920,4,B015XC884Y,i really liked the move good movie it is entertaining and a great family movie. but one of the things i didn't like about it was that the girls wore short shorts and short shirts. not modest at all but the main girl did not wear that stuff.and i liked how the girl got to know her dad more.,1464739200,,290,3.9322033898305087
7453921,3,B015XC884Y,Good family film but some of the acting was not great,1464739200,,53,3.909090909090909

7453924,3,B015XC884Y,It's a ok movie just really predictable,1462838400,,39,4.714285714285714
7453925,5,B015XC884Y,"Sometimes you want a movie that is sweet and wholesome. Add Kevin Sorbo, horses, some pretty scenery--and a good storyline--and you've got a nice escape for a couple of hours. I watched this with my grandson, who's six. At first, he didn't want to watch the movie, but after a few minutes, he really got into it. At the end, his words were, ""It was good, Grandma."" I liked the ""feel good"" aspects of the movie, which is similar to Hallmark fare. I also enjoyed the ending--which I won't spoil here. Watch it! At some point, almost everyone has a bit of  a ""rodeo girl"" in them--me included. I bet you do, too.",1462233600,,609,4.389380530973451
7453926,5,B015XC884Y,"Another Great Family Movie about family relationships, horses & coming of age.",1461456000,,78,5.583333333333333
7453927,1,B015XC884Y,"Really looked forward to watching this with our granddaughters who are crazy, head over heels about horses. The 14 year old fell asleep and the ten-year-old watched it, but they didn't want to watch it over and over like they usually do. Personally, I thought the acting was horrible. I could have put up with a predictable story line, but the acting was actually painful",1461283200,,371,4.723076923076923
7453928,1,B015XC884Y,"Horrible, horrible movie.  Beautiful scenery and horses and that is it.  Save your money!!",1460419200,,90,5.357142857142857
7453929,4,B015XC884Y,When Rusty was riding the bull his free arm touched the bull. He would've been disqualified for that. I didn't like how all the girls wore short shorts and mid tops that really isn't something I see at rodeos. Other than that it was a good movie!,1458172800,3,246,4.25531914893617
7453930,5,B015XC884Y,Great show,1458086400,,10,4.5

7453935,4,B015XC884Y,"It's a typical Hallmark sort of story.  Not the greatest film ever, but a good, entertaining, family movie with a wholesome message.  Good message about repairing a broken family.",1456099200,,179,5.137931034482759
7453936,2,B015XC884Y,The story is good but the acting was like a high school play...no a middle school play. I was very sad by this because I was really expecting a real movie. Kevin Sorbo was ok.,1456012800,,175,4.0285714285714285
7453937,1,B015XC884Y,"Soooo bad! The acting was hilariously pathetic and the director obviously knows nothing about horses or rodeo. My 3,5 and 7 year olds laughed at how bad it was. Please watch paint dry...you'll be more entertained.",1455926400,2,213,4.944444444444445
7453938,3,B015XC884Y,"Solid 3 decent film and I'm a fan of ol' Sorbo. Good family grandkids is just what I needed, plus grandma used to rude barrel",1455580800,,125,4.04
7453939,2,B015XC884Y,Poorly written and poorly filmed.  I was dissapointed because obviously someone not familiar with true rodeo scene wrote and/or directed.,1455580800,,137,5.85
7453940,1,B015XC884Y,"The acting was lackluster.  As a rider, the lack of detail (calling the horse a he and a she, English bridles with western saddles, totally unrealistic barrel progressions) was frustrating.  The plot was predictable.  Save yourself some time and skip it.",1455494400,2,254,5.146341463414634
7453941,1,B015XC884Y,"If you know anything about barrel racing or horses stay away from this movie. Horses ""race"" at a slow lope (my 9 year old barrel races faster on her dad's old ranch horse than the main character on her $75k jumper), the cameras have poles in way of turns in the shots, they play Rossini's Lone Ranger music during bull rides, talk about tornados ""turning around"" and one-legged bull riders who just ""wouldn't give up."" Seriously. And those are the high points.  I did enjoy her telling her dad about ""the cramps"" and hugging a pig at the ""Youth Rodeo Finals"" to show how country it all is. Did I mention the whole thing takes place in the cowboy capital of Michigan?  Ouch.",1454716800,2,673,4.463414634146342
7453942,5,B015XC884Y,Great movie! :) Love Kevin Sorbo and Sophie was great too. :) Thanks for a great movie with a wonderful message.,1454544000,,112,4.380952380952381
7453943,5,B015XC884Y,An enjoyable movie.  Actors made the plot very smooth ahnd interesting.  Another Joel  Reisig production which is just plain enjoyable,1454544000,,134,5.6
7453944,1,B015XC884Y,Had great promise. I was not impressed with the over acting,1454371200,,59,4.454545454545454

7453946,4,B015XC884Y,The movie was enjoyable. It was obvious that the horse was a pleasure horse and not a speed horse but other than that it was a good family horse movie.,1453852800,,151,4.066666666666666
7453947,1,B015XC884Y,I don't know you but I know that you are a better actor than these people.,1453680000,,74,3.6875

7453951,1,B015XC884Y,"Terrible acting and story line. I was expecting an authentic rodeo story line and decent movie, major let down. It is with disappointment that I don't recommend wasting the time to watch this.",1453248000,,192,4.848484848484849
7453952,3,B015XC884Y,It's a good story but I give it a 3 star because I find the music to loud compared to the rest of the film and the choice of music does not fit and is very annoying.,1453248000,,165,3.4864864864864864
8735027,5,B015XC884Y,i loved it because it gives a good relashin ship,1517011200,,48,3.9
8735028,5,B015XC884Y,"I don't know what everyone is complaining about on here. This is a great movie with good lessons. Filmed in Michigan it is also nice to see a film that is made in America instead of Canada. I'm getting really sick of that. This movie is chock full of characters, a selfish mother, a weird bratty rich kid, a dad who gives up to easily and a girl with a strong spirit. Add to that a gorgeous horse and this movie is well worth buying. I loved it, and it is a good one for teens to watch because it teaches about right and wrong and being a decent human being. Kevin Sorbo is great as usual, and so is the rest of the cast. A great movie for the whole family-(no swearing, no sex). A must see.",1516924800,,691,4.0144927536231885

8735031,2,B015XC884Y,"While the scenery was beautiful, there were a lot of goofs throughout the movie.... The seasonal timing was supposed to be portrayed as summer, but there were a lot of fall colors in the trees, and it bounced between day and night a lot to the point where when they were inside I never knew what time it was, and the days seemed way too long with everything that they did. The acting and lines seemed very forced, and the way the actors said it with the wrong emotion or none at all, really didn't make a whole lot of sense. Then there is the rodeo, there was a lot of misconception about what goes on in the rodeo, from the development of learning to barrel race to the final competition, it didn't show much progress, and the times stamped for the races are a little unbelievable.... Given the forced acting, and lack of knowledge of the inner workings of a rodeo, I didn't really enjoy this movie as much as I would have liked too.",1501891200,,934,4.3125
