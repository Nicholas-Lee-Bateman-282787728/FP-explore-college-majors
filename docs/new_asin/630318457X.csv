593752,5,630318457X,"What did he expect -- critics wanted another _Local Hero_ (or at least a  _Comfort and Joy_), and instead he gave them a picture even more somber  than _Housekeeping_. They couldn't dismiss with faint praise like  ""quirky"", or find the words or courage to explain that they  didn't understand it (guys, that's the point -- _nobody_ understands about  being human....), so they just panned it.
I firmly believe this is  Forsyth's best movie. And I really do believe it ruined his career.  Somebody in the Hollywood food chain had this killed (it was pulled from  theatrical release and didn't even come out on video for over a year), and  the film system has taken out the loss on Forsyth ever since.",962668800,14,699,4.710743801652892

If you are looking for a  typical Robin Williams film, like Dead Poets Society or Patch Adams or What  Dreams May Come, look elsewhere.  That is, if you are looking for an easy  two-hours of feel-good banality spoon-fed to you, look elsewhere.  If you  want a quiet, off-beat film that might actually require you to think, go no  further.

The film is broken up into five sections, for five different time periods, but none of them have any substance to them. There is a reason that this film was  smashed pretty hard when it was released. I'll watch pretty much anything,  but this remains the only movie that I've ever walked out of. I later  watched it again with a friend to prove that Williams really did a film  this bad, and it was worse the second time around. There is no reaseon to  see this film. If you looking for a good Williams picture, get ""dead  poets. . "" or ""Good Will. . ."" or even ""What dreams[the  book is better though].""  This film is terrible, but not bad  enough to justify being watched to mock, such as ""attack of the  killer..."" or ""THe Starfighters.""

There's so few laughs in this film, you could call it a documentary.  It's  definitely not on the top of the list on Mr. Williams' resume`, I can  assure you.  It's not even that entertaining, and I think that's something  else that detracts from the movie.  You think you'll be entertained, and  nothing really happens.  Mr. Williams' character goes from one tragedy to  the next, and it just never seems to get better.  The modern-day finale  story is good, but the rest of the film is just missing ""the  spark"" that he has in him when he has a meaty role (like ""Dead  Poet's Society"" or ""Awakenings""...or even ""Mrs.  Doubtfire""!)

593756,5,630318457X,"I think ""Being Human"" is one of the most underrated pictures of the last ten years.  Robin Williams plays five different men through successively more modern time periods - the first segment being in  prehistoric times, the second in ancient Rome, the third during the time of  the Crusades, the fourth in the Renaissance, and the fifth in modern-day  Manhattan.  Each man is on a quest which relates to his family, as he first  loses them and then, through the individual scenes, must find and develop  relationships with them.  Along the way, the human condition is analyzed in  dramatic and funny ways, such as what are common threads among human  existence - fresh food, good shoes, companionship, safety, honesty.  Williams is joined by a stellar cast, including Hector Elizando, Lorraine  Bracco, John Turturro, Vincent D'Onofrio, and several others.  Bill  Forsyth, the writer and director of ""Local Hero,"" also made this  film.  One of my all-time favorite films.",911347200,66,971,5.089171974522293

You only live once, but in this film, Robin Williams' characters lived at least 5 times during different times in history, and he sensed it.  It is a good attempt at showing how cyclical and interconnected life is, and how a human being's basic needs of food, shelter, and love are ingrained in who we are as a species.  Frankly, I have never seen a film that attempt 5 timelines with one actor who dies and is reincarnated, and I give this film 5 stars for originality.  I can see where the film would drag on for a simple viewer who wants a superhero storyline with Hollywood special effects and a happy ending, but this film is so much more deeper and meaningful.

594073,4,630318457X,"This is a melancholic film and you have to stick with it for it to engage your interest fully. It is not like you are snapped right into it from the very first scene. However, it did grow on me. By the time we hit the present day Manhattan one, I was very fully engaged. This is a very ambitious film too. Neither of the major figures involved in this film were particularly known at this time for melancholic work. That being Robin Williams and director Bill Forsyth.  Forsyth especially was identified with comedic works set in his native Scotland. Although his ""Comfort and Joy"" had a fair amount of melancholy in it.

Williams' career was characterized with going in and out of comedic masterpieces or serious, deeply melancholic works. The melancholic works he seemed to favor as the years went on. That he could carry either kind of movie on his shoulders from beginning to end (and probably get the whole thing financed because of his being in it in the first place) is nothing short of remarkable. Most of his peers given this kind of power in their prime would have picked sheer drivel for the highest price they could get. Not Williams.

Williams plays the lead in five human experiences throughout time, all involving the wrenching emotional drama of being close to others and yet being also forced to go it alone a good deal of the time. I don't think it is any coincidence that he is pictured alone with the ocean on the box with the tide at his feet.

I think the film does get stronger and stronger but I am giving it four instead of five stars because it really requires you the viewer to get through some pretty slow going in the early episodes. I can think of several directors who, tackling something this heavy, could have gotten it off the ground a lot faster, such as Scorese. One needs a lot of experience in drama to get something this heavy off the ground fast and unfortunately Forsyth's experience prior to this was all in light comedy. If he had had anyone but Williams in the lead, this probably would have been an epic failure.

594133,3,630318457X,"I honestly had no idea what to expect when I first heard about this film. All I knew was that it was composed of five separate stories that spanned centuries, with Robin Williams as the link between all of them. Sounds quite ambitious, right? Yes, but the end result was underwhelming and, dare I say it, a little dull. There are, however, some major themes explored here as indicated by the title. I guess if you were to boil the film down to its essence, it is, simply put, about being human. Being more specific, it is about mankind's search and need for companionship and family, along with all of the other small things, good and bad, which enter into our lives on our journey through time. Robin Williams' character Hector, a name which he has for the entire film, can be said to literally make a journey through time. It's not explicitly stated, but since he does keep the same name throughout, you could say that his character in each subsequent story is a reincarnation of who he is in the previous one. This is all fine, but there were some spots which felt underdeveloped and worst of all, the film is practically destroyed by some of the worst voice-over narration I've ever heard. Thankfully, by the final segment the narration isn't so omnipresent. By far the worst effect of the narration is to replace character development and spoon-feed the film's themes to the audience. I did a little research online, and apparently the director, Bill Forsyth, had to cut 40 minutes and add the narration after an initial cut had a poor test screening. It's a pity that that early version isn't available to watch, because I think the film would be better in that form. The closest I think the film got was the final segment, but that one segment didn't exactly make up for all that came before it. But it did tie the film together thematically, and provide a satisfying conclusion to the larger story arc. Overall it was a satisfactory watch, but it still felt like it was missing something. Better films like this would be CLOUD ATLAS and THE FOUNTAIN, but there are still elements to appreciate in this film.",1410566400,3,2115,4.612732095490716

I drew too many parallels between the character and the man I can never really know. It just made me sad - an unfortunate of bad luck to have chosen this particular film for my particular reason for watching it.

He's really good in it - but it doesn't celebrate his tremendous gifts or quirky, insightful pokes at the universe through his comedy. I somehow still fully expect him to emerge triumphant from whatever darkness enveloped him and that too will never materialize.

594181,5,630318457X,"I love this film. I've watched it more than any other.

This review isn't going to add anything that other reviewers haven't already noted. Still, I want to say that a movie like this could easily have gone the way of platitudes and condescending ""lessons"" about folly, loss, and perseverance. But thankfully the storytelling avoids hitting the all-too-easy dramatic arcs that we've come to expect from movies about Deep Stuff, giving us instead artfully subtle scenes that reveal the keen wisdom of Bill Forsyth and Robin Williams.

Williams' performance is brilliant; he gives each character a new dimension but maintains a distinct, essential thread through all incarnations of the character. He never overacts, never tries to make these characters more than they are. So many moments from this movie, and especially expressions on his face in certain scenes, are forever etched into my psyche. I really think this is one of his best performances and it is a shame that he was never recognized for it. I always wished I could have met him and told him how much I loved him in this role, but alas...

I've read that Bill Forsyth has distanced himself from the film after the Hollywood powers that be forced him to shorten it and add the voice-over. Admittedly, the voice-over is not the best part. So the movie isn't perfect. But it is nevertheless profound. Forsyth articulates the baffling, anguishing, rapturous and ordinary experience of being human with a sense of grace, humility, and humor. Every time I watch it, I notice something new.

(Oh, and also: the cinematography and supporting cast are each fantastic.)

I could write a book about this movie but I'll leave it at this mini-essay length. I am infinitely sorry that Robin Williams is gone, but I am equally grateful to him and Bill Forsyth for this film.",1407888000,3,1822,4.883495145631068

I haven't seen a movie quite like it and it explores things that aren't often explored in movies or fiction. I feel even if there aren't past lives that his can be seen as an analogy of different ways you live during your life, how you come new into things, how you deal with things, and how good and bad things just happen regardless of what you do.

594186,5,630318457X,"Being Human is definitely an anomaly for a movie that touches on medieval life. Most medieval-era movies are about the plague, bloody battles, or bloody battles in a plague-ridden area. In comparison, Being Human with Robin Williams is slow, thoughtful, and looks at how people lived.

This is actually a movie about five different time periods. Robin Williams starts out in prehistoric days, living in a cave with his wife and two kids. Then he's a Roman-era slave. Then he's a medieval crusader returning home. Next he's a Renaissance man who is shipwrecked. Finally he's a modern day man. It's sort of like he's being reincarnated, although of course he doesn't know that. All he knows, in each life, is that he's struggling with issues of family, home, children, and responsibility.

So, for example, in the first one he fails completely. His wife and kids are stolen away by raiders, and while he eventually tries to get them back, he isn't able to. He has to watch, sadly, as they are taken from him. In the very last one, he'd been an absent father after a divorce. He's tentatively trying to reconnect with his kids and rebuild a relationship with them.

The medieval scenes fall between the two. He's been off at the crusades, which was fairly common for men in this time period. His wife and kids are home waiting for him to return. But along the way he falls for a French woman even though the two can't talk to each other. He sleeps with her and goes back with her to her house.

He realizes she's a widow - she has her mother and a young child living with her. The house is warm, clean, everything he could hope for. And he's tempted. But at last he says no. As much as it would be lovely, he has his actual wife and kids to get back home to. They are waiting for him.

The medieval scenes are fairly well done. The style of house, the clothing, all of it fits reasonably well with this era. There are minor issues - at this time period the people wouldn't have had plates to eat off of. Food would be served on a platter and then the people would use old crusts of bowled bread to eat the food from. Nothing to wash up afterwards :).

So a good movie, slow, but interesting. The use of recurring themes across the timelines is fun, and the message that we all face the same sorts of hardships no matter what era we live in is fairly poignant. There's nothing new under the sun.",1405296000,,2391,4.4104308390022675

I do love this movie.  It's a unique film, with some quirky funny bits and a lot of heart.  Robin Williams plays a man/father during many various time periods.  Each segment is somewhat interconnected to the next, as well as to the present, but in ways that aren't easy to see, which is why many people may not ""Get it"".  (Not that I do! I just like the film!).  It's thoughtful, interesting, soothing, quirky, and great to see Robin actually attempt to act and not just try to be funny all the time.

594242,5,630318457X,"That's what the movie is about. It's very deep, but I agree with another reviewer that it is not for the average movie watcher. I first saw it way back when it was released in the theaters. It changed my life. After watching this movie, I made some major life changes. It helped me to see human life in the context of forever, instead of the way most people see it (very finite). Only some people will get it. So if you find that you like thinky movies or movies that aren't generally well-received, you can watch this film. Whether or not you believe in reincarnation at all or as it's presented here, I think it can still offer one a perspective on life as a time of learning. It can help a person remember not to beat oneself up too badly when mistakes have been made, it's all a learning process. Just try to do better next time (next time you have the same choice or next lifetime, if you believe in reincarnation).  If you like Oscar-winning films & directors, better skip this one. It is not for the mainstream audience.

UPDATE: I rewatched this movie today. I stand by what I said earlier: Some people will get it (and some won't). I absolutely love this movie! I wish I could locate and speak to the writer and director Bill Forsyth. There just aren't words to express my adoration.

If you're looking for some guidance as to what the movie is about and whether you'd like to take the gamble, look up Being Human (1994) on wikipedia. It will tell you in plain English what the movie is about. You still have to watch it to experience it though.

The pace is slow and subdued and you must be an insightful person to understand the full meaning of this film. I only wish I could get a hold of the director's cut.",1360022400,33,1720,4.315789473684211

I'm a big fan of history and what I think this movie provides is a fairly accurate glimpse into various points in history. There's not a lot of action or special effects, nor is there a big twist at the end. It's just everyday life in various points in time. Not necessarily mundane moments in time but nothing here is heightened by a convulsive series of unusual actions. For example, one of the segments takes place after a shipwreck. This is certainly not something that happens to the average person. But what they do once on-shore is typical for that period in time. They did hang people and many times quite ineffectively. And the guy in charge quite often wasn't prepared for the situation and had to make decisions that are based on a combination of his lack of experience and even intellect. Anyhow, I liked Robin Williams in this movie, I liked this historical aspect and I liked the fact this movie made me think about what it might have been like to actually live in these particular periods of time and what might be required to navigate the various hurdles in the day to day living just to survive.",1356566400,2,1230,4.520179372197309
594244,5,630318457X,"If you've never seen this fantastic film, here's a quick synopsis: Robin Williams tells the stories of five ordinary men during different parts of mankind's history - and prehistory, as witnessed in the first story of a caveman who is raising a family near the beach.  The second story follows a slave to a Roman politician.  The third story is about a Renaissance-era man who is shipwrecked with several others on an African beach.  The fourth is about a chap who is trying to find his way home and meets a beautiful foreign woman along the way.  The fifth and final story is about a modern-day divorcee who is trying to bond with his children during a weekend visit.

Perhaps the drawing part about this film is the fact that the characters are not Marc Antony, Shakespeare, or any other famous figure.  They're ordinary humans, regular people, common persons who possibly could have existed.  And in the short amount of time we get to know them, they are gone and replaced by another regular Joe who draws us in as well.

I love Robin Williams, even in serious roles.  The stories told are endearing and I rather wish they were longer.  And really, isn't that the point of entertainment? to leave the audience wanting more?

Also, it had several running jokes, presented in various ways, in each of the Hector life stories. One was about chickens and another was about shoes.

On one level, the movie could be about the human condition--therefore the name.  On another level it could be about reincarnation and the soul's journey through the ages.  As I said, I was blown away by this movie when I saw it.  As I walked out afterward, there were two older ladies ahead of me who were discussing the story.  One complained that she didn't understand a single thing about it and was thinking about getting her money back.  I was astounded.  The movie had so many layers and Robin Williams showed a depth that I had not known before but the women seemed to have missed it all.  I think this is what happened with the critics.

It's a interesting concept and the idea looks good on paper. However, it really doesn't work on film. The movie moved slow and several of the intertwining scenes were boring and distracted from the rest of the movie.

594303,5,630318457X,"Being Human is easily the most well crafted and intelligent film that I have ever seen as it truly does capture the unfathomable human experience.
Robin Williams transcends time as he is continuously ""reborn"" throughout the expanse of human history--beginning with an early European civilization and ending in what is the modern age. In each era, he depicts an average human being experiencing the trials of life particular to that time period. As a proto-neolithic, European man he witnesses the destruction of his way of life and the capture of his family by a marauding band from perhaps another clan or tribe. In this he experiences loss and pain, and likewise he drifts from life to life, immersed in the sorrows and joys of the human condition. From a slave to a shipwrecked noble, he spans time in order to bring us a vignette of humanity.
The movie is powerful and is one that leaves the viewer with that profound sense of depth that all universal, surreal movie experiences seem to convey. It is truly ashame that some critics claim that this movie was a good idea gone bad. I concur that most people more comfortable with exploding buildings and glittery special effects probably just didn't get this one.",1003968000,37,1215,4.818181818181818

I was at first drawn to the film through my interest in European history, although I did not know what to expect substance-wise.  I find that the movie begins with a rough start. First, the narration.  It was fine at the very beginning, but the style of the writing got a little bit annoying as the film progressed.  It would have been nice to have the little introduction at the beginning, and then let the ""story"" tell itself.
 To me, the first two-segments, though creative and interesting, seemed to be done rather unartfully.  While the themes and ideas floating around in them were quite sound and poignant, the actual execution was very unrealistic, especially in the first segment.  I know that historical accuracy (or believability, at any rate) is by no means the focus of this film, but it, for me, detracted from the overall experience.  The second segment, in Ancient Rome, suffered from the same affliction as I found in the first, though to a lesser extent.  I don't know if it was the script, the directing, or the acting, but I was not pleased with John Turturro's performance.  It looked like the authors of the film wanted to portray a foolish, cowardly man, and they did accomplish this, but he came out looking like a cartoon character in many instances.  One of the points of the movie is to sort of tie together all of human experience as being identical, and that to say that human experience has ultimately changed over the years is a mistake.  However, the beginning of the movie is riddled with ""chronistic"" cliche and seems to fall short of the film's ultimate goal, though these scenes are interesting and enjoyable in the same strain as the rest of the movie.
The third through fifth segments were much more balanced, although the child performances at the end, which are always shaky, were not pulled off perfectly.
Except for what I have mentioned, this is a very excellent film that tries to pull together the human condition.  This might sound ambitious to most ears, but I think that it was actually pulled off quite nicely.  You really do see a broad range of events and happenings in different men's lives, but the authors very skillfully weave them together into one story.  I think they are trying to suggest that we do the same, that is, visualize our own lives in a greater perspective.
This movie is honest and innocent: no big special effects, no trite storylines or fashionable comedy routines.  That, and it gives a worthwhile message.  Combine that with much better than average cinematography and decent, minimalist-esque music, and you have a movie very much worth seeing, despite its artistic imperfections.",979084800,4,2849,4.758130081300813
