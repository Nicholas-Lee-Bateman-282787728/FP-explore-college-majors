1618482,5,B00005KAO2,"Viz releases Ceres, Celestial Legend (Ayashi no Ceres), by famed manga story and artist, Watase Yu!  There are 8 DVDs that will be released, 3 episodes each.
Watase Yu is probably most famous for her first long running manga series spanning 18 volumes, Fushigi Yuugi (Mysterious Play).  All of the Fushigi Yuugi anime has finally been released here in America by Pioneer.  Ayashi no Ceres is a manga series that spans 14 volumes but only 24 animated episodes.  How they fit 14 volumes into 24 episodes will be interesting to see.
Ayashi no Ceres is about faternal twins, Aya (girl) and Aki (guy) Mikage, who on their 16th birthday must accept their twisted fate that is in their bloodline.  Aya and Aki thought they both had a normal life but that all changed after Aya went with her friends to get her fortune told.  A prophecy of darkness and power that comes when the 16th star and mood come together.  When getting home, their parents retain a cold attitude telling them that they had to go to their grandfather's house the next day (their birthday).  Naively going, all their relatives dressed in black sat a long table with Aya and Aki at one end.  A wooden box is placed in front of them asking them to open it.  At first afraid, the two open it revealing a severed hand.  Suddenly, Aki gets all these scars over his body and goes unconscious.  Aya gets scared and starts to panic.  Her family starts to attack her.  The truth was that her family wants her killed.  Why?  You'll just have to find out about the secret of the Mikage family and about Aya's destiny with Ceres.
This is a fairly new anime (2000) with really nice animation.  The animation is basically those of Fushigi Yuugi but with finer lines etc.  The Japanese voice actors are mostly new voice actors.  Watase Yu thought it would be a good idea because she thought it would be better not to go, ""Oh, he's so and so from so and so anime!""
The opening song is really nice, it's called Scarlet and is performed by Iwao Junko, the voice actress of Ceres.  It's a slow, smooth song.  The ending song is called ONE and features a rock beat.  The DVDs are said to feature picture galleries, intereviews and such so look out for good extras along with them.
Final Note:  DVDs are awesome, and with all these recent animes on DVDs, I cannot wait to see the visual quality.  This is an amazing series.  Expect more twists and turns as can be expected from the stories that Watase Yu makes.  Fushigi Yuugi fans will not be disappointed.",990144000,12,2500,4.5
1618532,5,B00005KAO2,"It all starts with the first episode(The Day The Star and The Moon of Sixteen Meet)
Mikage Aya is a seemingly ordinary girl who has just had her fortune told. The ominous fortune bothers her, however, as its cryptic  message appears dark and foreboding. On her 16th birthday, after some strange circumstances, she's invited to a birthday party at her grandfather's home. Although her grandfather's home is filled with pleasant memories, something sinister awaits her there.
In episode 2(Tenyo's First Kiss)
The awful truth has been revealed, and Aya finds herself fighting for her life. Her father, in his attempt to save her, has paid a very dear price. During her flight, however, she encounters the mysterious boy who saved her in the street once again. With her grandfather's henchmen surrounding the estate, will she and her would-be savior escape.
In episode 3(One who fell From the Heavens)
Facing her rescuers, the truth is finally revealed to Aya. It seems that she's really a mystical Tenyo with psychic abilities at her disposal. This fact makes her very dangerous to the Mikage clan who are trying their hardest to dispose of her permanently. Unable to accept this, Aya searches for her brother in the hospital, but finds her mother instead. Her mother appears to take her life, however.",1026777600,,1299,4.986175115207374
1618533,4,B00005KAO2,"I had to get the first video of the wonderful manga series that I love! But I have to say, first off, I HATE AYA'S DUBBED VOICE! Because I am understanding about the lack of decent English seiyuus, I try to over look it, but I can't help wondering why they didn't release a subtitled version. Afterall, no one wants to miss out on Iwao Junko's beautiful voice playing Ceres. So, another thing that bugs me is that Aya's personality is very different in the anime than in the manga. In the anime she often comes out as a whiney girl. In the manga, she's more playful. Then there is the fact that they pronounce the name 'Ceres' as 'sAIR-iss'. Everyone know that the name for the Roman goddess of the harvest is pronounced 'seer-eez' sounding like the word 'series'. (Note: The name for the Roman goddess of the harvest and plants is the derivitive for the word 'cereal', you know, like those Cheerios you eat every morning. Think about that.) The last thing that bothers me about the anime is the way the main characters like Shuro and Kei have such a minor role. It's too bad, because Shuro is a really cool character. Other than that, the anime is funny, interesting and cool. It's more dramatic than the more light hearted Fushigi Yuugi, but the story is quite touching. I recommend it to fans of FY and otakus everywhere.",1014076800,2,1324,4.4979253112033195
1618534,5,B00005KAO2,"This anime, I must say, I am totally addicted to. It's a wonderful series with great art, music, and characters. Though it doesn't have as much comedy as 'Fushigi Yuugi,' it has great plot twists. After watching this tape, I wanted to know what happened next. A major plus for me is that Aya(the main female character) doesn't annoy me at all as much as Miaka did in 'FY.'",1013385600,,372,4.405797101449275
1618535,5,B00005KAO2,"Finally! Dubbing that doesn't stink! I absolutely adore this anime. The storyline is so twisted it keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time, and it's not all mushy mushy either. Definitely recommend it to any anime fan, particularly the fan that enjoys a tainted love story!",1013299200,,284,4.7
1618536,5,B00005KAO2,"I was really happy when they rereleased this great series.  Ayashi No Ceres has to be one of the best.  I bet this version is even better, because when I saw this for the first time it was in Engrish.  I think what they did was translate the chinese into english.  But anyway you should all see this anime.  Its on of the best!",1012003200,,327,4.046875
1618537,5,B00005KAO2,"Volume 1 is an amazing start to the series as you are thrown into a anime about Aya and Aki, who are a brother and sister who get along.  It is there 16th birthday and they must go to there family, the Mikage Clan.  When they go they notice that the WHOLE family is there and they are acting all strange.  The family then reveals the truth about Aya and Aki.  I won't spoil anything but episode 1-3 is simply engaging and jawdroppings.
  The animation is, first off, wonderful.  It is some of the cleanest animation you will ever see.  The music is also perfect.  As it is as good, if not better, than Fushigi Yugi (The creator, Yuu Watasse's, other work.)  The characters are very vibrant.  Aya is sweet and mature, much like Aki.  Yuuhi is a goof, Suzumi is serious and protective, Toya is quiet and serious, and Mrs. Q is simply comic relief.
  If you like Yuu Watasse or Fushigi Yugi then get this.  The two are not very similar but still they are equally epic.
CONTENT:  Though DVD 1 says 16+, all you basically see is blood spurt out of a person, a person get shot in the head, brief detailed nudity, and a women chases another with a knife.  There are a few curses also.  It could be rated 13+ but after DVD 3 it will be a bloodbath of a anime.",1010275200,3,1251,4.206751054852321
1618538,5,B00005KAO2,I've been a fan of Fushigi Yugi by Yu Watase and I didn't think she would be able to top it.  I believe she out did herself with Ceres - Celestial Legend.,1009843200,,154,3.8125
1618539,5,B00005KAO2,"I really liked Fushigi Yuugi and this is in similar style. That means it has a very intriguing plot, characters with depth, some humor as well as fighting scenes. The main character Aya has a twin brother and their sixteenth birthday party goes haywire, with Aya finding out that she is an angel. Two mysterious guys save her from her family who is desperatly trying to kill her. Looks like a very good series, I can't wait. The animation is good, I always watch in Japanese with subtitles so I have no idea about the voice-over English version. The music seems to be good, but it hasn't hooked me like FY yet. There are the first three episodes on this DVD with some footage of the comic author Yuu.",999734400,,700,4.434108527131783
1618540,5,B00005KAO2,"This is a great anime! Its a little confusing if you don't pay close attention, but a real treat if you do! (Don't worry! Its not as confusing as lain!) The story begins when Aya (a normal high school student) goes to a fortuneteller and the fortuneteller tells her ""You will have a life saving encounter. The whole world will lose its balance once the sixteen stars are aligned your destiny will take place and your true will to live."" Then later that day a man steals a ladies bag and Aya tries to get it once it's going over the bridges railing. She falls over along with the bag and floats down onto the street then once a car is about to hit her she is saved by a young and handsome man named ""toya."" (Who looks exactly like Tamahome from Fushigi Yugi)The next day Aya and Aki (Aya's twin brother) go to there grandfather's house where there supposedly suppose to have their 16th birthday. Their grandfather gives them a ""gift"" Aki opens it and reveals a mummified hand. Aki then gets mysteriously hurt and Aya remains unharmed. This indicated to their grandfather that Aya is a threat to the family and must be killed at once. Now I can't go spoiling the whole story. I don't recommend watching this JUST because you like Fushigi Yugi. Its true the characters are drawn very similar to the ones in Fushigi Yugi, but the story and the plot are much more different than Fushigi Yugi. It has more violence and nudity. BUT don't let all those minor things interfere with you not enjoying the story because this is a great anime and in my opinion one of the best anime I have seen! ^_~",998956800,,1586,4.416382252559727
1618551,5,B00005KAO2,"hahaha yes the only reason I love this anime are the beautiful bishounens (beautiful anime boys) in Ceres. Eenie meenie miney moe, Aki, Yuuhi or Tooya??? AAAACK... no i'm kidding... *but i do adore them*
ok, seriously... WOW... what can i say? I've watched this until the last episode and I just have to say... again... WOW... the animation quality is so great, the characters are beautifully drawn, and the background scenes are so realistic. I agree, Watase Yuu had definitely matured so much in this anime since Fushigi Yuugi! (or maybe she just decided to go with a different mood this time) :)
Wonderful wonderful work. The storyplot is AMAZING! Bringing the Japanese legend of a tennyo (heavenly maiden) and her hagoromo (celestial robe) into the modern world of present day Tokyo, carrying a 5000 year curse passed on and on within the bloodline of the Mikages. I tell you, you're all in for a twist! There's so much more in the real story behind what really happened between Ceres and Mikage in the end!!! And lets not forget another big thing you'll find out in the end, the unsolved mystery of TOOYA's existence!!! I'm not going to tell you, you have to watch by yourself.
The storyline is kinda tragic, I'd say. Some scenes make me cringe because there's so much blood and violence. But thats what I love!!! The tragedy even made it more dramatic!!! And again, Watase Yuu-sama ALWAYS, ALWAYS delivers such a satisfying ending. You'd be sitting back, finally able to breathe freely when the anime ends... although you don't want it to really end because it's so great... but you would be so completely satisfied with the end. I, for sure, didn't go, ""aaah THIS or THAT should've happened!""
Simply, simply beautiful. Beautiful characters, beautiful storyline, beautiful music, beautiful animation scenes (did you see the Opening credits scene!? WOW WOW WOWWWW) The music... ah.. beautiful opening song... it's just such a beautiful song... and the ending songs... very nice and upbeat. When the ending music started indicating the episode is about to end... you're just on the edge of your seat. I absolutely loved the music!!! I'm quite surprised. I didn't really liked Fushigi Yuugi's songs...
You will not regret this. It's light hearted, and at the same time, deep with emotional-involving scenes and storylines and the characters' relationship... *sigh*...
so back to the first issue... Aki...? Yuuhi...? or Tooya...? eenie meenie miney moe... hmmm still can't decide... someone help me? :D",998006400,5,2504,4.992822966507177
1618552,5,B00005KAO2,"The series are very pretty,(all the guys are really cute!) however all fushigi yuugi fans be ware - this series are rather dark, definitely not appropriate for children under 13. Aya(main character) seems less of a klutz as Miaka was, probably because her ""other self"" is one ... off goddess!(or celestial spirit):)  The dvd looks very elegant, the inside insert is actually a mini *poster*! Extras include interview with creator of the ""Ceres"", also there are profiles for each character with black and white sketches. - definitely read those first, it will be much easier to watch a movie. Also, when you get the dvd there is an insert that asks if u want to sign up for ""Ceres"" manga (comics) (1 year subscription),this way you will get much more info on the series. Oh and don't be afraid to get hooked on it and become totally broke - this series are not that long (esp. comparing to FYuugi or SMoon) :)",997401600,,908,4.604938271604938
1618553,5,B00005KAO2,"Ahh, the glory that is Watase Yuu... All hail her..
This is Watase at her best, and Studio Peirrot brings her story great honor (especially since they successfully condensed a 14 volume manga into a 26 episode tv series). The animation style is much like that of Fushigi Yuugi (if you're familiar with that series, you know what I mean), based on the fact that the bishounen (gorgeous ""pretty"" boys) of the series look remarkably like those of FY. But in Ayashi no Ceres (Celestial Legend to us) the animation ""quality"" is much nicer and more outstanding. The storyline is more mature, violent, and graphic than that of FY, and the overall mood is much darker. An extremely compelling series!
If you're familiar of the story of the tennou (nymph) bound to earth because of her stolen hagoromo (robe), then Ayashi no Ceres is right up your alley because that is what it is based on. If you do not know the story, it is a very famous legend told in Asia and around the world about a nymph who's robe was stolen by a man. The loss of this robe meant that she could not return to heaven. She marries the very man who had stolen her robe, and bears him children, although eventually (according to Ayashi no Ceres' version) she returns to heaven declaring that every generation she will return to seek her revenge on the one who had taken her robe. In Ayashi no Ceres, the chosen one of the present generation is Aya, the main character.
The story starts out right away, and soon becomes so complex that it grips your mind as well as you heart. Having some of the same themes as Fushigi Yuugi (i.e. two people who once were so close are torn apart because of destiny, as well as romantic triangles), Ayashi no Ceres not only succeeds as a outstanding anime, it also far exceeds any storyline that you could see in many anime now-a-days...",993513600,13,1832,4.504504504504505
1618554,5,B00005KAO2,"Watase has made another incredible series. Ceres has a much darker story and heavier drama than Fushigi Yuugi, but it still keeps those silly Watase moments that FY had. Ceres is a MUST SEE SERIES FOR WATASE FANS AS WELL AS SHOJO ANIME FANS!!! Watase has not lost her creative touch a bit with Ceres. The animation is great (is it just me or does it look exactly like the FY OVA animation?) and the voice acting is top notch, as usual.",992304000,2,435,4.317073170731708
7942982,3,B00005KAO2,"Aya and Aki Mikage are twins. They are about to celebrate their 16th birthday. At their party, something odd happens. Aki is struck with serious pain and bleeding. His sister, Aya, is frantic and confused. Her grandfather tells her that her brother is very important to the Mikage family, but she must be killed. Aya is able to escape. She learns that she is descended from an angel. Things have become very complicated. Now she is on the run, trying to discover her powers, stay alive, and find her brother.

This anime has some good and bad points. The story has potential. For some reason, it seems awkward and doesn't flow well. For an older series, the animation is pretty good. I'm not a fan of the animation style where even the guys look like girls. That's what you get with this anime. The voice acting is pretty bad. I haven't  listened to the Japanese audio, but I don't think that I enjoyed the story enough to bother. I realize that this series is just getting started. There are only 3 episodes in this volume. It takes longer than that to get into most shows, but I don't have a strong inclination to continue watching.

Weighing the good and bad, and trying to be objective; I think this deserves 3 stars. It looks like it has potential, but it seems to be sort of rushed and unnatural. I can't recommend this series from what I've seen in the first 3 episodes.",1358640000,,1377,4.47808764940239
7942983,5,B00005KAO2,"Ayashi no Ceres is an emotionally charged tale that reveals more and more of its story as time progresses, as well as deepening emotional connections with its characters.
This first disc twists rapidly from a fairly standard high-school girl's day into a completely unexpected lifestyle.  For the empathetic, it's a very intense experience and for the philosophical, it does not lack interesting topics.",1274486400,,403,5.396825396825397
7942984,3,B00005KAO2,"I hate to admit this, but the manga of this anime was def better. The art is more detailed and the story is more fast paced. The story for the anime was kind of slow paced, and at first I thought that the animation was a little choppy...

I bought all 8 vols on amazon, and it was pretty cheap. I'm glad it was cheap. Honestly, if it had been expensive, I don't see me buying an actual boxset.

Yes, the story is very interesting, and I remember reading the manga, that's why I bought the anime in the first place... but I think they could've done a better job with the animation, the artwork looks like it was quickly put together and such....

I recommended buying all 8 vols on dvd off of Amazon, because again that's where I bought mine AND it was pretty cheap for 8 discs.... about a little over 30$.

I won't give up any of the story because loads of others already did that for me, lol.",1266883200,,893,4.144508670520231
7942985,4,B00005KAO2,"There's just something about a girl turning 16 in Japan that just brings on a tragic fate these days (Witness Scrapped Princess). Aya Mikage and her twin brother Aki have been invited to what they think is a party at their grandfather's sprawling mansion but is really something more sinister. The two are set before a table surrounded by family and some guys that look like the agents from The Matrix and Aya is asked to open a box. Inside is a stone hand which shatters when she looks at it as beside her, Aki begins to scream and become covered in bleeding cuts as if being sliced by an invisible knife! Somehow, the whole ritual was a sort of test to help the family make a decision to kill her and her father is given the gun to shoot her in the head! What the flip is wrong with these people??!! Aya will have to find out what mysterious being resides within her that allows her to harness divine powers if she hopes to survive the murderous intentions of her own family!

Even though this first volume was too brief, (it only had 3 episodes), I kinda liked that format, because it helps build the suspense. To me, the plot is pretty dramatic and intense. How could it not be, seeing as how two of the people that want to kill Aya are her own mother and father? This going against the laws of nature angle gives Ceres a real edge and potential to touch on pretty big themes. This helped me get over the pretty boy character designs that are obviously there to get girl's juices flowing. One minor annoyance that I've noticed in Watase's manga work is the terrible sense of comic timing she has. In some of her most serious scenes, she has the unfortunate habit of ruining it with slapstick humor, almost as if she is afraid of the dramatic extreme of human sadness or tragedy. There is a tinge of that on this first volume so I hope the anime writers keep it to a minimum. A good first volume.",1158796800,,1899,4.334269662921348
7942986,5,B00005KAO2,"I fell in love with this series as soon as I popped it in the dvd player!!  The characters are beautifuly drawn, the story line is awesome!  Romantic and tragic, this leaves you on the edge of your seat!  Full of bishounen guys too!  Who could ask for more!?  There's some neat extra's on here, including a short interview with Yu Watase herself about how she feels about the support of her fans.  There's also a nice character profile on here, along with a clip of Yu Watase drawing.  You have the option of English or Japanese audio with subtitles.  ""Scarlet"" the opening song, is sooooo gorgeous, I just wish that it had the translation on there since it has a text-less opening and ending, the only down side.  But other than that this is a great title to get, full of action, romance, and just an awesome series!  The story starts out with Aya (girl)and Aki (boy), 2 normal twins who are about to turn 16.  But on the day of their birthday they are summoned to their Grandfathers estate, along with the whole extended family!!  They recieve a mysterious gift that determines their fate, and turns Aya's family against her!  Can she find out the truth before her family kills her?  Could she really be the descendent of an angel?  You won't want to miss this series, I guarantee it will quickly become one of your favorites!",1055376000,4,1328,4.497907949790795
7942987,5,B00005KAO2,"I really enjoyed watching this series. I found the story line very interesting all the way through. I won't explain it because the other reviewers did a good enough job of that. It was hard to stop watching once I got started because every episode ends with sort of a cliff hanger. It was well worth watching and the money I spent buying it. The music is good, too. The opening theme, Scarlet, has got to be one of the prettiest theme songs I have ever heard. The DVDs I own have an interview Yu Watase in Japanese (of course) with subtitles, a character gallery, and other things. Over all, Ceres is another great series inspired by Yu Watase's work. Whether you like FY or not, you should definitely check this out. Rent it if you are really unsure about it, but I suggest buying it.",1053993600,,785,4.383561643835616
7942988,4,B00005KAO2,"Honestly, I have not heard of Ceres until my friend lent me this DVD. It had a VERY interesting storyline; tennyo angels are somewhat appealing, thanks to Ceres. Ceres might not be as popular as Fushigi Yuugi, but it's a great series nonetheless. The characters are well-written (Kagami is your typical villain, but he is also related to Aya...), romance is obvious and often leads to very sensual situations, and action is mostly bloody or imagined. Suspense is chilling and often kept me guessing (since I had absolutely no idea Ceres existed until then). However, Ceres is not for the young. Blood and violence, curses, and sensual scenes were a little surprise to myself, even though I was 16, the recommended appropiate age for this DVD. Buy Ceres if you don't mind such things, but definitely check it out if you liked FY or any romantic-heavy shoujo for that manner.",1049846400,3,873,4.826666666666667
7942989,4,B00005KAO2,"This is a beautifully done series with a solid storyline and likable/dislikable characters. But I have read all of the manga so I knew what was going to happen. The show follows the manga almost word for word, which gets old really really fast. But for those of you that haven't read the manga, then by all means, go ahead and watch it! I'm pretty sure you'll like it! And those that have read the manga are welcome to watch it as well (how could I stop you?), but just as a warning--it'll pretty much be the same as the manga.",1043280000,2,527,4.227722772277228
7942990,5,B00005KAO2,"Plot: Average teenager Aya Mikage finds out on her 16th birthday that her family wants to kill her because she's the reincarnation of the family's ancestor, a Celestial maiden, Ceres. Ceres wants to destroy the Mikage, so the Mikage want to destroy Ceres (who is sharing a body with Aya) first. Ceres especially wants to kill Aya's twin brother Aki. This results in a lot of trouble and heartache, then add Aya falling in love with Toya (who works for the Mikage) and Yuuhi (who's sister helps Aya) falling in love with Aya.....
My thoughts: Very different from Fushigi Yugi, Yu Watase's other popular work, which is funny and for the most part light hearted. Ceres is somewhat dark and it's dramatic. My mini-plot doesn't really do it justice, there's a lot that goes on in Ceres, I had to know what happens next and couldn't stop watching it (I have an imported boxed set). If only Yuuhi were real, I'd marry him in a second! I recommend watching the dubbed first so it's easier to pay attention to plot and animation, and then watch the subbed to get a real feel for the emotion of the show. There is just something about the Japanese language that expresses emotion better than English. Toya's Japanese voice seems to fit him better, while Yuuhi's English voice seems to fit better. The music is very good, recycled a lot, but very good.
Not for kids, I would say at least 13 and up. There's some nudity, violence, blood, and adult situations/themes.",1037577600,3,1454,4.6395348837209305
7942991,2,B00005KAO2,"Even though I liked Fushigi Yugi (to a point... all that ""Tamahome!"" ""Miaka!"" stuff gets on your nerves...), I didn't much care for this series. It wasn't BAD, but I was a bit bored with it. I thought the romance between Aya and that one guy is contrived, and starts out a bit too early (the first kiss in the tree scene). I just know this is going to be a gushy melodramatic romance.
The best thing is the plotline about Aya's special powers, and her wicked family, but I thought that could have been better too. One scene that didn't make sense was when Aya's mother attacks Aya in a hospital... why was her mother cutting apples in the hospital room?! It would have made more sense if they had the scene at Aya's house... how would her mother be able to bring a big kitchen knife into a hospital in the first place??
This isn't a series I would care enough about seeing again, but my sister will probably make me watch it anyway... she loves this sort of stuff...",1028851200,,966,4.313186813186813
