4119424,5,B003FSTN70,Criminal Minds is the most awesome show on TV I watch nothing else but them. I will watch it over and over again can never get enough of Morgan and Garcia they are just like my family. The best thing they did was to bring Prentiss in and Joe M just can't get enough of Hotch he is the best ever,1274659200,8,294,3.8360655737704916
4119425,5,B003FSTN70,"I have owned the previous 4 seasons on DVD.  Each time I get them, I spend almost two straight days watching episodes.  The fact that no single actor overplays the others, to me, is good acting ...unlike the previous post.  I liked this season and can't wait to watch it again on DVD.  I like learning about personality types, to the extent you can do that on a tv drama.  My  heart broke this year as Aaron has to hear his ex-wife's final words and the story of finding his son  in the chest.  I liked watching Morgan become the leader and seeing the sibling-like relationship between him and Garcia.  I am a computer analyst, but always love seeing what else is (or may some day) be out there in cyber technology.  I know it's a drama.  I know it's all fake.  But the looks inside some of our country's serial killers, for example, as Reed and others do, makes me wish I had studied forensic psychology.  I am not a critic of arts, per se.  The characters are believable and human.  Makes me appreciate law enforcement, while seeing their human side too.",1274572800,86,1056,4.398963730569948

4119455,4,B003FSTN70,"Definitely enjoyable to watch.  Thomas Gibson continues to impress as Agent Hotchner.  Everyone is decent, except Garcia.  Most the stories are pretty good, if not figured out and closed a bit to fast, but I get it, it's a TV show.  The ones that do get stretched out are to personal.  If they could do something like True Detective, that would be cool, but maybe that isn't realistic for this format.  Glad I added this show to my watch list.",1500336000,,443,4.475

4120192,2,B003FSTN70,I was VERY disappointed that the DVDs for the 5th Season of Criminal Minds from Anchor Media arrived in a cheap plastic case without an outer sleeve like seasons 1-4 from American Standard.  I have purchased other series (not in boxed sets) and they were packaged identically (with an outer sleeve) so I had no reason to think this series would be different depending on the outlet source.  Now I have season 5 that looks like it came off the back of a truck at a swap meet.  This also makes me hesitant to order seasons 6-9.  I have not opened the packaging so I cannot speak to the overall quality of the DVDs themselves.,1405296000,,623,4.391304347826087

4120198,5,B003FSTN70,"I love criminal minds!  The crime stories are horrific and so sad, sometimes hard to watch. But it's good fighting evil. I think the show portrays how hard law enforcement jobs can  be, and sometimes devastating to them and their families. It's senseless violence that the rational  mind can not make sense of.  I have always thought  profiling criminals and what makes them tick fascinating!  I really like how the shows end, with some famous quote to ponder.",1402876800,,460,4.833333333333333

This episode maintained a high level of suspense, developed real characters, and did not shy away from a tragic ending. What sticks in my mind is one of the final scenes in which Rossi reminds Hotch that it is Hotch who is responsible for creating a first class team than can function with him gone. The implicit message is that it the team that matters, not the stars. Well written and well produced.",1369872000,,468,4.390804597701149

Before I began watching ""Criminal Minds,"" the only 2 actors in it I had seen before were Mandy Patinkin [as Jason Gideon]; in fact, I began watching it completely due to him.  For those who don't know, Mandy is incredibly multi-talented...if you've never heard him sing, you've missed something great.  [He's a well-known stage actor.]  Joe Mantegna was the other I'd seen previously & I commend him for making Rossi so very REAL a person!

It's also to neat see Rossie do his stuff and to see Hodge occasionally smile or laugh.

4120420,5,B003FSTN70,"For those who don't know, CM is about FBI profilers.  They try to catch serial killers, pedophiles, arsonists and the like through the use of psychology, history, victimology, geography and other ""soft"" sciences as opposed to the CSI shows that use the ""hard"" sciences like chemistry, botany, biology and physics.  The shows look at various mental disorders and give us examples of real serial killers that shared those traits.  The plots are interesting because we see a crime and our heroes are called in by local police to assist.  They are three steps behind the killer.  They do their thing, analyzing everything about the victim, not just the body, but details of their lives; the abduction site; the site where the killer dumped the body; and other details, and now they're only 2 steps behind.  There's a lot of exposition where they talk out what they are doing and what it means.  The ending is the typical confrontation with the killer.  Sometimes they are captured, sometimes they die, frequently in gruesome and ironic ways, and a few times they escape.

This is the fifth season, so we know quite a bit about the private lives of the characters by now.  It's a quirky cast and I think you'll like them.  Most of the time you can watch an episode without needing to know any backstory on the characters, but that is not true for the start of this season.  In the first season the team leader, Hodge, was married with a son on the way.  Over the next season or two his job began to interfere with their marriage and they divorced.  At the end of 4 and continuing into 5 there's a serial killer that goes after Hodge's family.  Although each of the episodes works a case, there are segments of each that go back to that plot line.  Episode 100, fittingly titled ""100,"" is the culmination of that plot.  You won't understand this episode if you don't know something of the backstory.

The downside of this product for me is that there aren't enough extras.  Maybe the writers and directors are just really good, but there aren't many deleted scenes.  The series isn't geared around special effects, but when they blow up a building we do get a short clip on it.  There was a good explanation of the storyline I just mentioned on ""100"" but that's a rarity. The writers consult with some of the founding members of this group.  I'd love to have more short interviews with the writers and the consultants on how they came up with the ""unsubs"" (unknown subjects).

Despite this I gave a 5-star rating because I love the show.  The main cast is exceptional and the casting people come up with some wonderful guests like Tim Curry and Corbin Bernson.  I recommend starting with season 1.  On NetFlix it's only available on discs.  It's on Hulu but it's much more expensive. The price here was a great bargin, I received the order quickly, and I didn't have any problems with the discs.  I own them, and this is a series worth rewatching, especially in a weekend marathon, and if I get tired of them I can resell them, which you can't do with Hulu or NetFlix.",1339891200,,3062,4.568807339449541

4120428,4,B003FSTN70,"This is a fine series but definitely not for kids nor people with weak stomachs. It focuses on the BAU a group of FBI investigators specifically seeking out serial killers. One interesting difference compared to other criminal investigative shows is that CM focuses on the criminal and almost nothing on bringing the criminal to justice. A lot of these episodes are based on real life incidents in the history of serial killers. The strength of this show is the serious tone and intricate details of how said serial killers elude local authorities for long periods and continue to acquire victims (sometimes they are especially clever) and even when the BAU shows up it isn't always a happy ending. Just watch the finale of this season or look at the impact this career has had on several of former and current characters in the BAU if you disagree. Some of the character relationships are pretty strong but the nerd jokes on poor Reed are getting a bit old so they need better jokes or to just let it go because it's old. Each episode does a nice job of opening and closing with an intelligent quote which reflects the incidents of the particular episode. Of the 23 episodes for this season I would say the creepiest to me were: ""Mosley Lane"", ""Our Darkest Hour"", ""Haunted"" and ""Cradle To Grave"". There was a short lived spinoff from this series called Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior with Forest Whitaker in the lead. The show is going on its 7th season and a video game is coming out this year for it.

4120447,5,B003FSTN70,"Criminal Minds has been a rollercoaster in some resects because the Behavioral Analysis Unit is not one of those 9-5 jobs. It scars its members and it sometimes leaves them in pieces, checking them out and tattering them much like a library would do to books it keeps on shelves. The only problem with this is exactly what happens to the people. With Gideon (Seasons 1-3) you had a change that happened as he progressed and saw loss. He was not the same, hurting me to watch, and he became a shell that needed to walk away. The same can be said for other member,s like the one who came back despite the turmoil and the career in books and the problems in places like Ruby Ridge. Then there is the doctor with the family, the tech that had a lead problem (I'm allegic to bullets, they break me out in all kinds of badness), adn now Hotch.

Of all the people that ever have anything happen, Hotch has it the worst. He already has problems within his family and it has played out, from the married to the wanting to leave to the way things played out and the seperating. The worse comes later than that, here, and it is bad. The Ripper is called back from the brink and he makes a little dancing debut, and that thing isn't one of those band-aid things that happens in a few episodes. It changes everything and it hurts to see.

As far as the episodes, more darkness and more serial killing mingles into the stories. There are staples that are here as well, from the arson that occurs to the other bits, but you have a storyline that follows hotch as well. It occurs in the last season a little and then at the end, and you see the pain it all brings. You see the violation at the end last time and you see the way things break, and you wonder what wil occur. C. Thomas Howell is great in causing it, too, and the Ripper character is one of those things you know will always second-guess the best and the brightest.
I like it.

As for extras and whatnot, I was not overly amazed. I do not expect a lot, either, but some things ar enice. I personally like the deleted scenes but never th elooks back, and I say that because they are spoilers in a nutshell.
5/5 for it and a thanks for your time. You could read other reviews - I appreciate you seeing what I think and I hope this helps.

I know it is a television show and they play characters, but the cast is so incredible; the chemistry is second to none.  Until the series actually comes to an end, I intend to be on the ""notify me"" list for the next installment!  A definite must purchase if you love this show.",1292457600,,411,4.1645569620253164
4120452,4,B003FSTN70,People who are hard core devotees of this series may have to agree that this might just be the last good season of Criminal Minds.  So far season six episodes are so flat that it's easy to assume that writers have been told to pen the swan song of this show.  Couple that with CBS giving two members of the ensemble the axe and it's not hard to believe that the series really ended with season five.,1291680000,,399,4.1688311688311686

4120475,5,B003FSTN70,"Glad each assemble character had their spotlight episode. In the final scene with the Reaper, real law enforcement would have emptied the gun because a few bullets don't necessarily kill a perp like in the movies or TV. Also, being shot that many times in the chest into a bulletproof vest doesn't stop all the impact and would have cracked or broken several ribs. Any punches or blows to his torso would have been very painful.",1285718400,,428,4.644736842105263

4120478,3,B003FSTN70,"I am hooked on this series.  I have throughly enjoyed the first 4 seasons and I think the story lines in this season are good however, it says little for the screenwriters when the graphics are in overload.  The episode with the construction workers proves the point here.  I believe the viewers are more intelligent and capable of following the storyline without the extreme graphics.  The graphics in this episode are themselves on overkill.  This takes away from the story and diminishes the overall acting and production.  In my opinion, this season, seems to be disjointed and more character-personal.  Character-personal is important however, this season appears to linger more on this theme than I feel is necessary.  Somewhat boring.  Appears this wonderful series could be winding down.",1284336000,6,795,5.196850393700787

4120480,5,B003FSTN70,I just started watching Criminal Minds in January 2010 and am completely addicted to it. I have purchased all 4 seasons and watched them through at least twice. Each episode is creepy and interesting and keeps me riveted to the last moment. I love each of the characters and the way that they relate to each other. One of the other reviews mentioned the fact that none of them outshines any other and I completely agree! Can't wait to get this season since I missed several of the early episodes.,1283731200,4,496,4.522222222222222

4120482,5,B003FSTN70,"""Criminal Minds: Fifth Season"" contains the 23 episodes of the latest dramatic season for this outstanding and unique TV police procedural, in which the FBI's Behavior Analysis Unit tracks down criminals by getting inside their heads.

The ensemble cast remains a strength of the show, returning Thomas Gibson as team leader Aaron Hotchner, Joe Montegna as Special Agent David Rossi, Matthew Gray Gubler as Dr. Spencer Reid, Shemar Moore as Special Agent Derek Morgan, Paget Brewster as Special Agent Emily Prentiss, A.J. Cook as Special Agent JJ Jareau, and Kirsten Vangsness as Analyst and computer whiz Penelope Garcia.

The Fifth Season opens with a disturbing episode in which Hotchner is tortured by the recurring villain and serial killer known as the Reaper.  His ex-wife and son go into protective custody with the US Marshal Service while a healing Hotcher attempts to catch the killer.  This multi-episode story arc culminates in a terrifying mid-season episode, in which the Reaper captures Hotchner's family, triggering a fight to the death with consequences for the whole BAU.  Special Agent Derek Morgan will finally get his chance at a leadership position, while the team will adjust, for the moment, to getting along without Hotchner.

The Fifth Season rotates the spotlight so that each agent gets to lead an episode.  Among the highlights: a case in David Rossi's hometown in New York state, where old friends are now members of a criminal family; and an episode set in Alaska, in which Penelope Garcia gets face to face with a serial killer in a very small town.

""Criminal Minds: Fifth Season"" is very highly recommended to its fans, and to new viewers looking for a powerful and gritty police drama.",1282176000,57,1721,5.056537102473499
4120483,5,B003FSTN70,I just started watching Criminal Minds by accident about a year ago. I can't believe I never heard about it.  Now I am addicted to it.  It is one of the smartest and well cast series to date.  The George Foyette episodes were brilliant.  Thank god for reids new hairdo he looks more mature. I have watched almost all of series 1-4 and cannot wait for season 5  I never tire of watching it.  I am so glad Joe Mantanga was added he completes the package. There was more humor in this season especially from Hotch.  Why this show is not nominated for and Emmy I'll never know. I love that everyone is allowed to be themselves and helps each other work through personal situations.  I don't know if they can top this season.,1282089600,16,720,4.32089552238806
4120484,5,B003FSTN70,"CRIMINAL MINDS, despite some intermittent cast changes through the seasons (yes, we all miss Mandy Pritikin) continues to bring us smart television.  The dialogue may at some points seem like a roundtable dissertation on aspects of abnormal psychology, passing from one character actor in the investigative team to the next, but the information they disclose in these sessions is fascinating and makes sense to the viewer.  Each segment begins with a significant quote and each ends with one and this seemingly small technique shows respect for the viewer.  The cases more often than not are those of serial killers, showing us how these criminal minds are created by their background, what constitutes their behavior, and how examining that studied behavior as each new case develops leads to their capture.

The cast still includes the magnetic Shemar Moore, Paget Brewster,  the intense Thomas Gibson, A.J. Cook, Matthew Gray Gubler as the would be nerd but brilliant thinker, Joe Mantegna and Kirsten Vangsnes (often the brains behind the breaks!). What a team - with enough chemistry to keep us all involved over the weeks of each season.  And then there are often guest stars as the Unsub (Unknown Subject of an Investigation), stars of the caliber of Jason Alexander. This is a thinking person's show and a well produced one at that. Keep them coming!  Grady Harp, August 10",1281139200,10,1381,5.057268722466961
4120485,5,B003FSTN70,"Season 5 of Criminal Minds is by far the most emotional of all past seasons. I am an avid CM fan, and have all of the seasons on DVD. This season is full of emotional episodes, from the very first, ""Nameless, Faceless"" to ""100"" and most recently ""Exit Wounds"". There are a lot of amazing Morgan & Garcia moments. Each character has at least one central episode, although I would term this season a primarily Hotch season.

I would consider this a must have for any Criminal Minds fan!",1274832000,43,484,4.438202247191011
