8761227,1,B01FR35978,"Stalkher does a rare thing, it uses older actors for roles which traditionally for this genre would be, for at least the female victim anyway, played by a young hot actress. Im not saying that Kaarin Fairfax isn't attractive, Im sure if you were her age, shes quite good looking, but for your normal demographic that horror/thrillers are aimed at, shes probably old enough to be their grandmother. So when you take out sex appeal for this type of movie, youve got to have a really great plot well written to satisfy the audience.  Stalkher doesnt have a really great plot, dialogue or well anything really. Most of the film is played out by just two actors, Fairfax as the woman whose house is intruded upon, and John Jarratt as the intruder.

Jack (Jarratt) is tied to a kitchen chair at the table, while Emily, the woman who he broke into the house to do whatever he intended to, has turned the tables and is tormenting him.  Unfortunately nothing great really happens, theres just a lot of dialogue of each character being rude to the other and putting them down.  Its pretty obvious what is going on but if you missed it the first time, the two drop plenty of hints throughout.

When Stalkher ends, you're not left thinking, wow what a great movie, you're thinking, gee that was pretty boring, I wish Id wasted an hour and a half doing something else.",1463356800,,1355,4.559670781893004
8761228,3,B01FR35978,"Emily (Kaarin Fairfax) is a friendly middle aged nurse at the town hospital. While she is slightly past her prime, she is still desirable as she wears a silver ball around her neck. After seeing a glimpse of her, we see she is the ""victim"" of a home envision by Jack (John Jarratt) who works at the pharmacy. Jack runs into a taser and finds himself tied up as the battle of the sexes mind games ensue.

The film is a dark comedy, light on humor. The dialogue gets bogged down in a trade of insults between men and women that are beneath the characters. The film also wanders off into imagination where there are delusions of violence to hold our interest.

It doesn't have the intensity of ""Extremities"" or ""Misery.""
