Background soundtrack is like nails on a chalkboard. Still, it's nice to see a documentary on fandom without a ""look at the freaks"" vibe.",1387929600,,328,4.771929824561403
8115022,4,B000EWAUI6,"I saw this DVD (before it was released) at the NOREASCON4 World Science Fiction Convention here in Boston back in September 2004.

At the end of the show, as I left the room, the first thing I said in response to the question ""How did you like it?"" was ... ""Can I buy a copy?""  I have been patiently waiting for it's release ever since .. and waiting .. and waiting.

The production quality of the show I saw was not ""hollywood"" quality, since many (most?) of the scenes were shot *at* various conventions over the years, with handheld cameras, often in crowded hotel rooms .. BUT the famous faces mixed in with just plain FANS all telling us different aspects of SciFi Fandom make an excellent story.",1146009600,14,701,4.4609375
