7479653,5,B016R7C3AE,"This movie is great for it's time. The restoration is also fantastic. It's old but has an incredibly modern cinematic take and edgy feel. I actually hate Quentin Terrentino's movies, but I enjoyed this movie immensely. The story follows our lady ninja as she avenges her mother's betrayal. Don't want to give away too much but this is Japanese cinema at it's best. Very enjoyable.",1455148800,12,380,4.861538461538461

7479656,4,B016R7C3AE,"These two Lady Snowblood films were filmed in 1973 and 1974 respectively, and directed by Toshiya Fujita. These movies are based on a manga (Japanese comic) called Surayukihime, which tells the story of Yuki, who is the daughter of a woman who was raped. After Yuki grows up and learns the art of sword fighting she seeks vengeance for those who raped her mother and killed her mother's husband and son. The film takes place in the Meiji period  from 1873 to 1893 as Japan was moving from a feudal society towards an imperialist powerhouse so a lot of the film takes place in a rural like setting. The film uses a variety of layers of representation and themes ranging from Buddhist fatalism to pulp absurdism, while modulating naturalistic and painterly visualizations.

This blu-ray has been remastered, and comes with interviews with Kazuo Koike, who wrote the manga that inspired these films, as well as the screenwriter Norio Osada. This set also includes a fold out sheet with an essay by critic Howard Hampton. For those that enjoy this type of film featuring feudal Japan one might also want to try ""Kwaidan"", which is a film showing a series of four ghost stories directed by Shigeru Wakatsuki.",1454112000,15,1203,4.806763285024155
7479657,5,B016R7C3AE,"Finally, we in the U.S finally have a good version of not just Lady Snowblood, but also part two. Lady Snowblood is one of the best films of all time and the sequel isn't half bad either. Though the disc is a little scarce on special features, there are two films that both look great. All in all if your of fan of Lady Snowblood this is definitely the disc to pick up.",1452384000,17,369,4.068493150684931

7479659,4,B016R7C3AE,"The Complete Lady Snowblood is a double feature from the early 1970s. Both films take place in turn-of-the-20th century Japan. In the first, Lady Snowblood, Yuki Kashima (Meiko Kaji), is a female warrior of Samurai blood seeking vengeance against the people who murdered her father and brother and raped her mother, all before she was even born. With a vendetta plot reminiscent of The Godfather, Lady Snowblood features a seductive, beautiful protagonist with considerable skill in using a blade hidden in her umbrella.

In the sequel, Love Song of Vengeance, a wounded Kashima has avenged her family and is visiting their graves. She almost immediately snaps into action when ambushed by a group of bandits, and is pursued by a large dragnet of cops who are after her for her crimes in the first Lady Snowblood film. The police eventually offer her a pardon if she agrees to help them get incriminating evidence on a revolutionary leader.

Both movies  take place against the background of the Meiji restoration, a period in Japanese history that ushered in modern Japan. After 300 years of isolationism under the Shoguns, the shift of power to young emperor Meiji led to increased interactions with the West and a new policy of expanding trade and colonialism.

Bonus features on the Blu-ray edition include new interviews with Kazuo Koike, the author of the manga  a style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels aimed at adults as well as children  that inspired the films, and screenwriter Norio Osada; trailers; and a critical essay. The films are in Japanese, with English subtitles.",1451692800,69,1594,5.018939393939394
7479660,5,B016R7C3AE,"If you never seen these films catch them on a streaming service or El Rey Network
Quentin Tarantino was inspired/ripped-off both Lady Snowlood films along with Thriller: A Cruel Picture when he wrote/made Kill Bill 1 & 2
The Criterion BR would not be a good blind buy if you know very little about the film
If you are not a fan of revenge films with crazy gore this ain't for you.
If you don't want the over priced mark-up on the Criterion blu ray There's a strong alternative blu ray
Any die hard film fan/collector might just wanna go the extra mile
And purchase The Complete Lady Snowblood  disturbed by Arrow video a few years back
The only negative it's Region (B)
but, if you are spending more then $30.00 for any Criterion blu ray I'd think you have a region free blu ray player
you can get the Arrow home video version on sale all the time plus It's a awesome looking steelbook
it will cost with s&h to the states less then $20.00 us

This is one of the worst Arrow Video BR's in terms of special features
The $35.00 SRP is pricey but, it's Criterion (There releases are hit and miss in terms of value)
If Criterion actually puts money into strong exclusive extras it might be worth it? depending what the extras are
the Criterion version is in a basic BR Case with that massive blue (Criterion Collection Sticker on the box)
The Arrow video is a awesome looking Steelbook (That still is easy to snatch up for under $20.00 there is a clear BR case version but, the steelbook is the way to go cause it looks so cool
I don't work for arrow video just a consumer.... Stupid me forgot you're not allowed to say anything criticizing various things online The Walking Dead or Criterion come to mind  Pointing out money saving alternatives to  consumers is such a horrible thing! I must have some evil motive I've spent a good chunk of money on Criterion Collection dvd's & br's in the past so i can be a little critical",1445299200,52,2707,4.648535564853557
7479661,5,B016R7C3AE,"So many people compare these films to Kill Bill.  They claim Tarantino got his inspiration here.  But no matter if he did or did not, these are terrific films on their own.  And the idea of bloodthirsty female revenge is not new.  Kuroneko is an older Japanese film where the women are possessed by vengeful cat spirits, reborn, and slaughter samurai.  Not new.

But these are sumptuously shot, richly colored films from 1973 and 1974, which were in a weird lost decade for Japanese film (there were some good ones... but a LOT of bad ones).  These films were based on the manga of a similar name (Japanese translations can vary).

So do not compare these to Kurosawa or Tarantino, enjoy these on their own.  They are over the top, bloody revenge flicks.  They are amazing for being what they are and not trying to hard to be anything else.

This 2 Blu-Ray collection was a stunning price and has TONS of extras! (digital tons... not real tons... heh).  Criterion has produced a lovely set for the fans.  Thank you for showing your love Criterion.  Now take my money!",1514246400,5,1067,4.576719576719577
7479662,5,B016R7C3AE,"After watching these movies Tarantino seems like he went to Steal Film University, but nevertheless these are timeless martial art classics.",1508457600,,140,5.714285714285714
7479663,5,B016R7C3AE,"Beautiful, chilling and great copy of both Lady Snowblood movies. If you are a fan of Quentin Taratino's Kill Bill this one is for you! This was one of the major inspirations for Kill Bill including the use of the song Flower of Carnage that was used near the ending of the first volume, sung by no other then our leading lady. Meiko Kaji is a fantastic actress that stared in many movies during this period, including the famous Lady Scorpion series. She shines though as Lady Snowblood. The first movie is beautiful however the second does not live up to the first in my opinion but is still worth a watch.",1507507200,2,608,4.4375
7479664,2,B016R7C3AE,"Done in the tradition of Lone Wolf and Club, we're watching a live action comic book brought to life with some peculiar results.  I had actually never heard of this series, but since Criterion slapped their label on a remastered print, I took a chance.  And I think I got sold a bill of goods.

Lady Snowblood is based off of a manga, Japanese comic book series, and unlike American comic books (usually, but not always, meant for pre-teens and younger) there's lots of violence and blood shed in this series of stories.  Said violence is translated to the screen with some pretty rediculous results.

I gave a pretty decent review to Lone Wolf and Club, but I did so thinking it was an intentional parody of the samurai genre.  Well, having seen Lady Snowblood, it's apparent that the Japanese take these kind of comics seriously.  Which I think is a commentary on the psychology and beliefs of Japanese society.

We see all kinds of violent antics and stunts, as per the Lone Wolf and Club series, and the acting and production values is on par with that series of films and other similar samurai fluff.  But no expense is spared when it comes to sets, costumes and props, for no matter how ridiculous the actual story material, the production values are first rate.

And as a personal aside, I guess that's the thing that gets me about these kinds of films, when I think of the James Bond series with Sean Connery, there was a high camp value to it, but also a kind of seriousness.  With Lady Snowblood and other similar films of the genre, it's like both author and audience or oblivious to the ludicrous quality of the story, much of it being the fault of both writer and director.

The martial arts genre has some ""near mysticism"" about it.  That is the feats that the characters do (loosely based on real life martial arts' maneuvers) are seen as supernatural by the less educated.  And that allusion is even put directly into the story.  So you get a kind of detchament that supposedly makes this series of films plausible in its own fictional universe.  But the problem remains that it's the action and near laughable quality of the martial arts' scenes that, for me at least, torpedo this thing.

When I saw the machine-gun baby carriage sequence in Lone Wolf and Cub, I turned off the TV right then and there.  I get those same kinds of feelings with Lady Snowblood.  It's that hard to take.

A better film would have been to have make her a little more grounded, not make her the martial arts shiboni master that she's allegedly to be, and put more world savvy into her and less female-warrior into her character.

And I guess the bottom line is is that if you like martial arts' films, then as a derivative work this might entertain.  But if you've seen any kung fu theatre at all, and find a lot of it comical in a bad way as I do, then avoid this thing.

The film making style is typical high-kamp Asian filmaking, with lots of blood and impossible stunts surrounding a main female character who is pretty one-dimensional and, regardless of her personal history, I find unsympathetic.

Watch at your own risk.",1506124800,,3124,4.547406082289803
7479665,4,B016R7C3AE,"Good movie, seems like a Quentin Tarantino film. i love this film. but there are some small faults to it. nothing too big to complain about",1505952000,,139,4.384615384615385
7479666,5,B016R7C3AE,"If you didn't know that Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill series wasn't inspired by Lady Snowblood, you'd know within the first fifteen minutes. And you can see also why Tarantino was so inspired: Lady Snowblood is inspiring, the premise of it is gold. The action scenes are campy with A LOT of blood spray, but that's part of its charm. It's okay to laugh even if it's not meant to be funny, but in-between the chuckles, it's so easy to fall in love with with this movie's style, choreography, and cinematography. It's breathtaking. Do the sword fighting scenes get repetitive? Yes. Does the whole thing get tired at times? Oh, yeah. But: who cares? It's Lady Snowblood, and she's BAD ASS.

Lady Snowblood: Love Song of Vengeance, its sequel, is not so good. It's a poor, painfully boring, and even more campy version of its former-self. You won't be missing out on anything if you skipped this one. As for the original, though:

7479671,5,B016R7C3AE,"A classic 70's film series that is referenced by Tarantino throughout Kill Bill 1 + 2, Lady Snowblood is hours and hours of pulpy, gory, vengeance-driven action.

Like the Lone Wolf and Cub series, there are just as many quiet moments as there are big violent ones, and it's a credit to the era in Japanese filmmaking.

Without spoiling anything, if you're a fan of swords and samurai movies, get rid of your sense of honor and dive into the twisted world of revenge, Lady Snowblood style!",1499040000,,489,4.609195402298851

7479673,3,B016R7C3AE,"Meh. On the surface, this movie has many plot devices I love in action movies: lone hero, revenge motive, just desserts, cool sidekick, action, of course, and in that the movie was very good. What I did not like about it was the overuse of blood spray. Now I know where Tarantino got the idea from to copy for Kill Bill. This is a really cool effect, but like swear words, when used judiciously. (Like at the end of Sanjuro, for example.) After a while it gets so over the top, so overdone, you are either laughing at it or getting bored by it, and that is a shame, because it ruined a good movie. I don't know maybe the gratuitous blood spray was some sort of comment on society or the movie maker was trying to make some other artful statement of irony that I did not pick up on, but I kind of doubt it. It just detracted from the experience. Definitely worth a watch, loved the way it looked (aside from sprays of red paint.)

While the special features aren't anything that special, it is still two movies for the price of one, and they've been painstakingly restored to fine detail and brilliant color, per Criterion's usual high standard.

*Plot and ending analyzed*

I guess if you have the brain of a gerbil and chew sugar candy all day, this film should fit your bill just fine.  Others might want a little more in the way of a coherent story.  There are parts of Lady Snowblood that are atmospheric and colorful, but the idea is not handled with enough competency, or even concern.

Lady Snowblood is some dull, waif of a woman, who has a feeble umbrella sword, whom she uses to chop in half corpulent bodies, hands, limbs and heads.  Okay.  The enemies are as imbecilic as the premise, even unable to fight such a woman.  They just sit by and wait to be ""chopped up"".  I must admit that the high reviews made me think these films would rate as high as Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman or Lone Wolf and Cub, but they are nowhere near as great.

Still, they are worth a look for the time.",1468972800,,890,4.275449101796407

7479691,4,B016R7C3AE,"I just bought this collection and the two iconic Lady Snowblood movies from the 1970's are a nice set to have, especially if you like to see Japanese revenge films with lots of gushing blood that looks like red paint.

The Criterion Collection has done a great job with the blu-ray restorations of these movies, but the subtitles are white and small and very hard to read. The subtitles are often against white clothing and backgrounds, so half the time I was unable to read what was being said.

It would be nice if Criterion would give viewers a choice of watching movies with subtitles in either white or yellow. In other foreign movies I own, I have found that yellow subtitles are much easier to read and this adds more to the enjoyment of the film

Other than the subtitles, this Lady Snowblood set is worth adding to most collections of this genre of Japanese cinema. However, please be forewarned that the violence in these movies is of a very graphic nature, and may not be suitable for some viewers.

The Criterion Collection is to be commended for continuing to make available a wide variety of films from America and around the world. And these two Lady Snowblood films never looked better.",1468627200,6,1202,4.629107981220657
