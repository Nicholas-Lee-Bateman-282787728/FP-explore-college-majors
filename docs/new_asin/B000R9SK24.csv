The description has nothing to do with the film, and for what it is, Dream Slashers is not very good, this one wasn't even interesting. The interlaced stories all tangle but not all are an amusing journey to their outcome. A complete annoyance to look at and listen to.",1384214400,,326,4.637931034482759

It has all the elements to make it a very ""watchable"" entertaining movie.  Considering the cast is not comprised of notable superstars, they are all pretty good.  The one that plays ""Josey"" is great... very real and believable.  It didn't hurt that she is drop dead gorgeous either!  Even my wife agreed that she was spectacular!  Buy it!!!",1185408000,7,507,4.555555555555555
