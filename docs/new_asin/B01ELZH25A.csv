Shame on the medical community for making it so difficult for people to find a solution, and the largely useless 'rehab' industry for suppressing this CURE in order to keep their racket going.

Alcohol is #3 killer world wide.

Typically the only option is to stop cold and never go back and fight a daily battle of resistance.

Movie shows the science behind a pharmacological extinction method with a safe drug sold over the counter in many countries

Game changing treatment where:
1) The treatment is effective (over 70% success).
2) The treatment if FDA approved for the condition.
3) The treatment is safe
4) The treatment is inexpensive
5) The treatment has a long history with few side effects
6) The treatment is well studied

and yet NO ONE including most Doctors is knowledgeable and talking about it?!?

The movie draws its own conclusions (the drug not under patent and the multi billion dollar rehab industry isn't interested in cures in general) but the science is compelling and the problem is real and widespread.

If this movie can bring awareness to a very serious issue and can help people realize that there is another option for curving dependence without radical life changes (and it does) then it deserves 5 stars and promotion.",1501113600,2,1185,4.836633663366337
7738691,5,B01ELZH25A,"I am writing a research paper for a Ph. D. program on addiction so I was looking for quick down and dirty information.  I was pleasantly surprised by what this film offered. I never heard of the medicine Naltrexone Hydrochloride (C20H23NO4-HCl), which is classified as an opiate antagonist.  What I have learned in my research is that this drug was first owned by a small company and later purchased by Dupont.  The drug was patented at the end of its patent life by Dupont.  In turn, it became classified as an orphan drug.  What that means is that nobody really owns the drug patent and any company can make it!  There is not much profit if you have loads of competition.  Not only that there is more money to be made on drug and alcohol treatment programs than there is in curing the addiction with this inexpensive method.  I give this documentary an A+ for educating me on the application of the medicine. Nonetheless, I did my own research because it was sounding a bit like it was too good to be true.  My background research led me to believe it is an altruistic endeavor and people close to addicts that have lost their lives have made this film. It is based on love, not on money.

No medication works perfectly for every single person it is prescribed to.  Also, to bash AA that has saved thousands of people from alcoholism was in poor taste.  The longest person taking the medication was 7 months, considering that people stay on medications for years that is not convincing evidence that the medication works over the long haul. And supposedly, you drink less and less until you are simply no longer drinking, but everyone in the film was actually still drinking. And alcohol is still poison to the body.

7738717,5,B01ELZH25A,"The National Anxiety Foundation endorses this DVD. I am its president.

This DVD can save your life. It was filmed by Actress Claudia Christian who has devoted her life to publicizing the barely known naltrexone extinction treatment of alcohol overuse and addiction also known as the Sinclair Method.

Many persons who suffer from anxiety discover that alcoholic beverages give them partial relief from their anxiety symptoms. Indeed alcohol has been used for centuries by anxious people to settle their nerves.

Alcohol is a horrible treatment for anxiety disorders. Dependency upon alcohol can develop quickly and severely in some persons with chronic anxiety disorders. Tolerance to alcohol develops as higher and higher doses of alcohol are required to achieve the same benefits in anxiety relief which were obtained in the beginning. If the person drinks large amounts of alcohol daily, their body becomes physically dependent upon this level of alcohol so that alcohol cannot be stopped for even one or two days without the person experiencing physical withdrawal symptoms. These are tremor, rapid heartbeat, elevated blood pressure alternating with falling blood pressure upon sudden standing from sitting or lying down, sweating and insomnia. In severe cases, sudden death can result from seizures induced by this alcohol withdrawal syndrome.

Drinking alcohol in excess for months or years takes a hard toll on the body. Liver failure, heart problems, dementia, and peripheral neuropathy are but a few examples of alcohol related diseases, some of which can be fatal. Collapse of social and family relationships may result. Unemployment may be consequent. Death from motor vehicle accidents may occur from alcohol use. Imprisonment may be a consequence of alcohol misuse.

Although alcohol problems are not anxiety disorders, due to the statistical risk of developing alcohol problems by persons suffering from anxiety disorders, the National Anxiety Foundation believes its website is not complete without educating the public about it. I decided to write this section because I asked Dr. David Sinclair, Dr. Raymond Anton and Dr. Roy Eskapa to serve on the Scientific Advisory Board of to get the best minds in the world to give advice.

A medical break though in the treatment of alcoholism!

The traditional method of AA and inpatient educational alcohol rehab has been helpful to individuals who have been fortunate enough to respond to it. I am so glad that we have had it to help people all these decades.

The Sinclair Method of treating alcoholism is a new way of treating alcoholism that works in many more people than our traditional manner of dealing with alcoholism. It is named after its discoverer, Dr. David Sinclair a noted psychologist and researcher who worked in Finland for 30 years on this worldwide killer. Dr. Sinclair and his colleagues found from their experiments with alcoholic rats that if the alcoholic rats were given naltrexone before being given alcohol, over a period of 3 months the rats gradually consumed less and less alcoholeventually an inconsequential amount!

As it turned out, the human clinical trials in Finland revealed that human alcoholics follow the same pattern as did the alcoholic ratsit just took the humans about 9 months to become inconsequential drinkers (Rats learn quicker than people it seems, said Dr. Sinclair who was known to be quite fond of his laboratory rats.). I tell my patients that it takes 9 months, Its like having a baby.  Results vary. Some people respond much quicker than others. Much more reduction in alcohol use occurs in the first three months than the third three month period.

The largest US clinical trial to date, the Combine study (see the Anton, JAMA reference at the end of this section) showed the same thing.

In the Finland human study, 78% of alcoholics responded to the naltrexone treatment. Only 10 % dropped out of the study for any cause. That leaves only 12% that failed to respond to the treatment. Those are the statistics I seem to obtain in my own experience with my patients

This is the most exciting breakthrough in addictive disease in our lifetime. Up until now the traditional manner of treating alcoholism seems to me to have a 1 year follow-up success rate of about 5%. Now we have a 78% successful treatment.

The trouble is only a small minority of physicians know about this. Why? One reason might be explained by an additive disease specialists question, who after listening to Dr. Sinclairs presentation of this treatment asked, I just have one question. How am I to make a living after this gets out? It is true that we will not need but a small fraction of the present billion dollar corporate and government alcohol rehab institutions as they presently exists. But we will still need both since Naltrexone does not work in 12% of persons who do it properly.

By the way, what is naltrexone? It is not a narcotic (narcotics are addictive pain killers like oxy, oxycodone, heroin, etc). Naltexone actually blocks narcotics. It was a trade name drug called Revia. It went generic several years ago. According to DR. Sinclair, American doctors we instructed to use Revia the wrong way, it turns out. The package insert still says to use Revia in the absence of drinking alcohol. Actually it only works if the patient is actively drinking while taking Revia. So it never made much of a splash back in its day since we all used it the ineffective way. Now we know how to use it to its best advantage, in actively drinking persons. Naltrexone also comes in a once-a-month shot which, is often not affordable.. It is called Vivitrol. I have had good success with it as well.

One may read about this in Dr. Roy Eskapas book, The Cure for Alcoholism, Benbella Books, Dallas Texas 2008.  https://www.amazon.com/Cure-Alcoholism-Medically-Eliminate-Addiction/dp/1937856135/ref=dp_ob_image_bk

Physicians may find the Raymond Anton scientific article illuminating as well. It is published in the peer reviewed American Medical Association publication, the Archives of General Psychiatry: Vol. 65 No 2, Feb 2008. An Evaluation of Mu-Opiod Receptor (OPRM1) as a Predictor of Naltrexone Response in the Treatment of Alcohol Dependence. Raymond Anton MD, et al.

Thank you reading about this exciting new option for those with alcohol trouble. It is so important. A few years ago, I had the tearful experience of attending the memorial service of one of my former panic disorder patients, a beautiful and spiritual young woman, who became afflicted with alcoholism and tragically died from liver failure at only 36 years of age.

7738732,4,B01ELZH25A,"I applaud Claudia's efforts to spread the word about the Sinclair Method (TSM) and Naltrexone.  If it wasn't for people like her and the website C Three Foundation, people like me would be without this option.  I am currently trying this method for alcohol abuse and am into my 8th week. I, like Claudia and others in the film, have tried everything I could think of for most of my life to abstain or cut down with little success.  That included 2 years of attending AA meetings. AA is great for some people and I think it's a wonderful organization that has helped millions of people, but it doesn't work for everyone.  I'm one of those people it didn't work for and I really gave it a go.  So now I'm using TSM and finding it has it's ups and downs, just like any treatment does but have noticed some success on it.

One thing I experienced first hand that was described in the movie was the ignorance of health care professionals and the resistance of traditional substance abuse professionals.  I went to 2 doctors who refused to prescribe it to me, including my pcp, before I found one on C three's website.  I have to drive 3 hours to see her, but to me it's worth it.  So yes, there is definitely professional resistance to TSM.

My one criticism of  the movie and why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it focuses too much on the instant success stories, like Claudia's and not enough on what is the reality for most people who try TSM. It really does take most people over 4 months, and some as long as 8 months to a year before they can be considered ""cured."" I am one of those people and it's a slow slog and many days I wonder if it's going to work in the end.  With that said though, I have had a reduction in my drinking while on Nal, and to me any reduction in harm is a positive thing.  I guess I would like to see a follow-up movie that goes more in-depth as others have mentioned about side-effects (most people have none) and other information about the drug and more about people who have been cured and about people who have to spend months on TSM before it cures them.

I would say to any nay-sayers that you need to give this method a chance before you dismiss it. And to the reviewer in AA who said this was just another excuse to drink again,  if AA is working for you then you should continue doing that, but for everyone that AA doesn't work for, this is another option.

All in all it's a great movie about a great breakthrough. Neither are perfect, but there is no magic pill or perfect cure for alcoholism.",1469232000,12,2540,4.249480249480249

7738737,1,B01ELZH25A,"I'll preface this by saying that I am an alcoholic who is 5 years sober from drugs and alcohol. I know the struggle. It's the hardest thing I've ever done or will ever do. It's still a battle, but treatment centers and AA have me tools that I use to help win that fight on a daily basis. It gets easier which is not what this documentary would like you to believe. Don't give up. Keep fighting and don't buy into quick fixes like this garbage because there is no quick fix for something that was, or still is, so freaking big in our lives.

Where to begin? Miss Christian is not a doctor, not even close, but she did have memorable roles in movies like Maniac Cops 2 in the 90's. However, she believes that she's discovered an easy answer to alcoholism- a disease that has plagued mankind since forever and combined with drug overdoses kills more people every year than car accidents. The only method that has lasted and worked since 1938 and that courts mandate for that reason is AA and/or rehab facilities. Do these work 100% of the time? Of course not, we wouldn't be addicts if it was that easy! It's a process. There is no fix. Addicts love a fix! But there is none for this disease... That is until Claudia Christian comes along! According to her and a few other non-professionals, whom have sworn by her method for as long as seven months, taking a drug known as Naltrexone before drinking can turn an alcoholic into a moderate drinker. ""I didn't even feel the need to finish the bottle,"" says one follower. Hallelujah! Even if we choose to buy this ludacris approach, shouldn't we be questioning our drinking to begin with if every single time we chose to drank we had to take another drug just to make sure we didn't ""drink the whole bottle?""

This theory also presupposes that alcoholism is a physical disease which is it NOT. Unless you are a stage 5 alcoholic, like I once was, your body doesn't NEED the alcohol. It is your diseased mind that is looking for escape and alcohol is the easiest and quickest way out. We then need to ask why we want out to badly and address the root causes whatever they may be. This naltrexone idea is a bandaid. Not even a bandaid it's a wet used bandaid which is much better in the garbage because it's probably just going to get us more sick.

I'm too tired to even write about this but Miss Christian beats to death this point of ""Why isn't this drug more readily available?"" Well, because it's primary function is an opiate blocker. And it's also not hard to get, at all. There is no government conspiracy keeping us from Naltrexone. I was on it in treatment years Ago because it's secondary effect is the possibility of limiting alcohol cravings. That being said, it can help keep you from the first drink, after that you are right back to yourself and on the path towards death. Doctors don't prescribe it to people looking to moderate their drinking. Because if you're going to a doctor looking for drugs to help you not drink sucidally, well then, maybe you shouldn't be drinking at all.

Alcoholics get better by slowly bettering the mind, body and soul. I use AA to help me with this as do millions. But whatever works for you is great. But it's a process and a slow one.

There is no One Little Pill to fight this tragic and brutal disease. It may never be found. If you want an excuse to go back to drinking, find a better excuse then this mediocre dreck. I can guarantee you this, there won't be a Sequel because anyone who subscribes to this method will hit bottom all over again.",1467676800,10,3540,4.423312883435583
7738738,5,B01ELZH25A,"As a nurse practitioner, I think this method is a wonderful approach to dealing with a devastating personal and social problem. No wonder health providers have not been educated on Naltrexone: Big Pharma and the Alcohol industry doesn't want to lose money! I will be recommending this film to every provider I work with. I will also recommend this program to my patients. Thank you Claudia, you are a beautiful person, inside and out.",1467417600,7,434,4.878378378378378
7738739,5,B01ELZH25A,"I don't advocate pushing medicine but why at the very least is this not an option more widely offered? And as far as side effects, I can't think of any worse than drinking and driving, resulting in multiple deaths. ""The medicine is not a cure for addiction. It is used as part of an overall program that may include counseling, attending support group meetings, and other treatment recommended by your doctor."" (Mayoclinic.org) It's worth checking out if you love someone with an addiction or have an addiction and love yourself and want to recover.",1465862400,8,549,4.851063829787234
7738740,4,B01ELZH25A,"Wow!

This movie is about a medication that has saved actor Claudia Christian from alcoholism.  She follows several people who also take the drug and interviews doctors and other specialists in the field of addiction and recovery.

It's an EXCELLENT and informative movie that will have you researching this treatment for yourself, family or friends.  I can think of several people that I will be sharing it with.  Texted one while I was in the middle of the movie.

I was going to give it 5 stars but I agree with the comment that there should be more info about the drug.  What's it made out of? Who makes it? Does it work for everyone? What are the side effects? What are the long term effects on the body?

It would have been great to meet some people who have been on this treatment for 15 years.  Are they still ok? Do they have a funny twitch? :-)

But outside of that ... I feel that this movie is AWESOME!  I learned something NEW and informative and I will most definetly add it to my list of MUST share and watch again.

I really feel like you will hit pause and say what I did, ""WOW thats amazing, I HAVE to tell ------!""

I watched it on Prime for free but I will be buying it to share with people who don't have it.",1465516800,13,1229,4.200854700854701
7738741,2,B01ELZH25A,This movie was informative but it never gives viewer the side effects or the fact that this drug doesn't work for every one. It also puts a negative spin in AA which does work for some people and that there are others optoions out there like SMART recovery which is not based on a higher power. I work with substance abusers (some have been prescribed this medication) and often times it takes a combination of methods to help people. Please don't think this is a cure all. If it was I would be out of a job,1465516800,3,507,4.237113402061856

I'm not a healthcare provider, but I am a journalist who has written countless stories on alcoholism for a primarily-medical weekly publication. I have NEVER heard of this medication, nor have ANY of probably hundreds of physicians, psychologists and therapists I've interviewed on treatments for alcoholism ever mentioned it.

I am only in week 1, but have already noticed many positive changes. TSM bring hope, options and a true feeling like you are in control of your future.
