6262465,3,B00IF8Q0BM,"Except for Dean Cain's performance, this movie really wasn't that good. A lot of the characters are very unbelievable. Lawrence Hilton Jacobs portrays the most trusting air marshal I've ever seen and the guy who goes outside the plane tied to a long line of seat belts, armed only with a hammer, to dislodge something from one of the planes engines is hysterical. At the beginning of the movie when the pilot and co pilot are incapacitated, Dean Cain very easily gets into the cockpit and starts calling all the shots and no one knows his background or gives him much resistance. He is the only reason to rent (not buy) this movie.",1396224000,,631,4.592920353982301

6262467,4,B00IF8Q0BM,"Dean Cain,Robin Givens & Lawrence Hilton  Jacobs.

a Kondelik movie.

Actually besides happening to be topical,This movie has alot going for it.

Dean Cain is a Must go  to of B-movie leading men having recently been on AMC Comic Book Men with Kevin Smith.

Robin Givens as a scientist comes off as smart and half way through film removes her blouse.

Lawrence Hilton -Jacobs plays a Air Marshal,Take that ! Liam Neeson & NON STOP A pictures.

Lots of special effects used real well and made it feel dangerous and toasty.

The supporting cast is led by two,One good guy ,TULLY : Morgan West,Who had alot of emoting and lines and The Bad  CRIEGER :David Vega,Who was a stereotype middle eastern early onand then became this maniac with an amazing penchant for beating good to death.

6262470,2,B00IF8Q0BM,"I actually really like cheesy disaster movies.  I feel so much better about my life after watching them.  Work is making me crazy?  At least I don't live next to a volcano, fault line, tsunami zone, etc.  I also love Dean Cain, and had the biggest crush on him as Superman/ Clark Kent on the New Adventures of Lois and Clark from the mid-1990s.  However, as great as an actor as Dean Cain is and as much as I enjoy disaster movies, I can't say this one is one that will ever be watched again.  As someone who took a violent earth geology class once upon a time and enjoys watching documentaries on volcanos, I would have done a better job with the science that whoever they hired for this.  The scientific basis here is so wrong to just be appalling.  Also, there are plot holes large enough to fly a 747 through.

So while the acting is over the top for some, it's not the worst I've seen.  The special effects weren't very good at all, unfortunately.  And the plot, boy did it need some help.  I think they must have been writing the screenplay as filming started, and they threw in as many tropes as possible: the self-sacrificing hero, the frantic mom, the calm cop, the crazy crackpot, the tech genius, etc.

SPOILERS!!!  ***  SPOILERS!!!  ***  SPOILERS!!!  ***  SPOILERS!!!  ***  SPOILERS!!!  ***  SPOILERS!!!

So the premise is that the plane is mistakenly over a brand new group of volcanos, apparently just birthed by Pele herself and with no warning by the USGS or the scientific community (wouldn't happen, we have far too many sensors in the Hawaiian islands for this to happen with only 10 minutes of warning).  The pilot and co-pilot are killed without taking the plane off of autopilot.  Superman himself is on board, and knows how to fly a 9 passenger small plan, so obviously a 747 is the exact same.  Comm is out due to the ash and electronic activity, so they're just casually circling the volcanos, or Dante's seventh ring of hell.  Just far enough so that they're not cooked alive in their giant metal tube by the superheated pyroclastic surge that manages to travel across the ocean and kill everyone else, but close enough that debris and lava bombs have to get dodged like a giant game of Galaga.  A genius geologist who just happens to be on the flight manages to cobble together a way to override the broken comm system (that miraculously also eludes the issues caused by the volcano), but THEY DON'T ASK FOR THE AUTOPILOT OVERRIDE CODE.  Guess the movie would have been too short if they'd just called back ""yo, dudes, it's 094387, see you in Honolulu soon!""  Lots more scenes with the passengers freaking out, one crackpot trying to foment insurrection and then more panic and screaming.  Then scenes of the local military base and a young, idealistic sergeant convincing the crusty old colonel to risk everyone and everything to save the passengers.  Rescue attempt fails, and then succeeds, ignoring all laws of physics and decompression at altitude.  The day is saved, except Superman zagged when he should have zigged and a chunk of rock (kryptonite?) crashes through the plane and impales him in the chest.  So Superman is indeed super, and flies the 747 now loaded with explosives (and these must be some super special explosives since it was in a small backpack) that's powerful enough to blow up the entire volcano before it can erupt, releasing the pressure gently (how!?!? I need there to be at least a little bit of an attempt at science!) so that Hawaii is saved.  Good job, Superman.  Sorry you're dead, though.",1499040000,,3552,4.643659711075442

6262476,3,B00IF8Q0BM,"Oh, gosh, so many h8rs for a film that doesnt aspire to be anything more than worth every penny of your $1.50 at the Redbox.
Youd do yourself a favor to cut this The Asylum outing the break your IMDB and Amazon peers have denied.

The preposterousness and cheesiness of this comic book melodrama are actually redeemed by some winning performances; colorful and creative, if not convincing special effects; and a cast totally committed to this project, no matter how ridiculous the plot thickens like flowing lava.

The story: Some unclear natural disaster has created volcanic activity of such scale that its essentially turned the West Coast into Mordor.

As it happens, an airline (for some reason, just one airline, and not hundreds) is approaching L.A. at that exact time, and ends up flying straight into the volcano.

It flies and flies and flies, for the entire 90-minute runtime, somehow, despite engine failure, pilot deaths, insane terrorists, low fuel, volcanic heat, flying lava balls and ash clouds so hot they turn beachgoers into piles of cinders.

How will they survive? How can the volcano be stopped?

Youll be surprised how much youll care about those answers.

The cast: Dean Cain got too fat to be Superman, so now he turns up in The Asylum roles Greg Evigan turns down to preserve his dignity. Hes OK in this one as one of those stock-character passengers who happens to know how to fly a plane once the pilots are dead.

Surprisingly endearing is a turn by Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, famous only as Freddy Boom Boom Washington on the 70s sitcom Welcome Back, Kotter, as a grizzled air marshal. Somebody give this Hollywood veteran a cop series.

Robin Givens shows up, characteristically devoid of any charm or personality, as a volcano expert who only serves to forward and describe the absurd pseudo-science of the films main conceit.

And as is true in pretty much every other The Asylum flick, the supporting cast and extras act their little nobody hearts out, as if this stupid DTV kerfuffle was Terms of Endearment.

The SFX: Most of the time, it looks like a CGI aircraft superimposed on a Renaissance painting of the Catholic interpretation of hell. But you cant say thats not doggone pretty to look at. Most of this film is the fire-orange hue you wish Crayola made a crayon of when you were an insane little kid.

A couple of times, when a piece of lava hits the plane, or as the plane flies over vast magma fields, it looks really cool. Credit the editor as much as the SFX team for creating fine dramatic tension on the cheap.

Other times, it looks like a cartoon. Like a Bullwinkle cartoon.

The lowdown: Look, you watch a movie called Airplane Vs. Volcano, you know Its from The Asylum, you cant fault the thing for wasting your time because it wasn't Star Wars.

Few production houses require viewers to leave their brains at the door as often as The Asylum. But when we do, were occasionally charmed by the end product.

Airplane Vs. Volcano is one of those pearls in an otherwise slimy oyster bed.",1460851200,,3035,4.71969696969697

6262478,2,B00IF8Q0BM,"I'm a Dean Cain fan and i like low budget disaster movies, but this one is pretty poorly done. It's like the writers and director weren't even trying. One example is when the story switches to a military hub where soldiers are trying to save the plane Dean Cain is flying: Soldiers with beards and/or long sideburns! What branch of the service do they serve in? Then we have a guy who is eased out of the plane in mid air to fix the engine. When he's done, he pulls off his oxygen mask and yells ""I got it,"" as if anyone could actually breathe or speak clearly while standing on the wing of a flying jet liner. It's just one silly moment after another. Dean, please stop doing garbage like this.",1439942400,2,695,4.2727272727272725
6262479,2,B00IF8Q0BM,"First off, this is a SyFy movie - so toss all logic right out the door.

The pilot - and the co-pilot - continue to fly into an area of ash clouds caused by a new ring of active volcanoes and neither of them think to divert a few degrees?

Then they end up dead and Dean Cain has to step in - carrying the baggage of his deceased wife and children along with him.

You'd think it would be simple from there but, no - there is a nut-job on the plane, the air marshal gets plugged AND the auto-pilot is locked and the only circuit breaker for it - AND DEAN CAIN KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE IT IS - is only accessible by someone with smaller hands than he has - the flight attendant.

So, of course, she hits the fuel dump breaker (What?  You turn it OFF and THEN IT DUMPS THE FUEL????) so they barely escape being blown up while flying circles around a new volcanic ring in the Pacific.

MAGICALLY, CAIN SOMEHOW MANAGES TO STUFF HIS FAT HAND IN THERE AND TURN OFF THE FUEL DUMP!

HEY, WHAT ABOUT THE AUTO PILOT???

But no, now the whole panel has 'SHORTED OUT"" - but the auto-pilot is still in control.

Which begs the question - if the auto-pilot is flying the plane, THEN WHY IN THE HELL IS HE STILL SITTING THERE AND PRETENDING TO CONTROL THE PLANE?

Cue the rescue attempts - and there are plenty of them.  Name a movie with one and they duplicated the scene in some fashion.

After all is said and done, a simple load of 200lbs of C-4 (which just HAPPENED to be available on one of the rescue planes), TARGETED AT THE UPPER SLOPE OF JUST ONE OF THE VOLCANOES, is enough to stop the multiple eruptions and save the day - as long as CAIN PILOTS THE PLANE INTO THE VOLCANO!

Which he does after a suitably tearful - AND LONG - parting sequence between him and the flight attendant.

Sometimes you just gotta shoot the screen writer and start over...",1434499200,5,1841,4.1784702549575075

6262490,2,B00IF8Q0BM,"If you pick up a DVD and it's called Airplane vs Volcano and you're expecting it to be realistic or anything other than the type of film it is, you've obviously got to take a good hard look at yourself.  The cover even boasts ""from the producers of Sharknado"".  It's not even trying to be authentic, it's a low budget film, with mostly unknown actors, or actors such as Dean Cain in this case, who used to be on a popular TV show, but haven't been cast on much since and need to do whatever they come across for the couple of grand they get so they can buy their meat from a butcher and not get it out of a pet food can until the next one of these sorts of straight to DVD films comes along.

You know going in there's going to be obvious green screen action behind the cheaply made sets and that's what you get here.  You know the extras aren't always going to be in character for the numerous retake of each scene in the background, but since the filmmakers don't want to reshoot it again they still use the footage, you get that here.  You know no research is going to be done as to say the procedures an air marshal would actually take when a passenger who's already been in the cockpit without him noticing asks him to come talk to him behind the curtain and tells him the pilot and co-pilot are dead, but I need a bit of help moving them out of their seats so I can sit there.  You know there will be something like cutting off all the seat belts (as you know they won't need them when the plane crash lands later) and clicking them all together so you've got a long rope to tether to a passenger you want to drift out to the engines will be in the film, you've got that here. You know the on board airline staff aren't going to have been trained in what to do in an emergency so will just take direction from whoever is the most dominant passenger.

You know the writing will be bad, you know the acting won't be brilliant, you know the film will be unbelievable.  You know all that stuff going in so what you just want to know is will it be entertaining, at the very least if you're just being entertained by the absurdity of what you're watching.  Airplane Vs Volcano is slightly entertaining in this way, but overall is pretty boring between most far fetched scenes. Give it a go if it's on TV or you can somehow watch it somewhere for free but don't expect much.",1412294400,,2373,4.175054704595186

No indication at all of any knowledge of how air liners work, military command works, the geology of volcanoes, and the duty of air marshals, let alone physics--the result is a bunch of screaming and obviously manufactured melodrama in a script with so many plot holes it couldn't hold mash potatoes.

There is a Marshall on board and a guy who looks like he is going to yell Allahu akbar at any time.

The airline panic is interrupted by military on the ground panic, apparently the only other people watching a new volcano ring forming. The film becomes an Asylum hall-of-famer during the airplane repair and rescue scenes. The guy with the plastic breathing mask and lanyard by a string of seat belts outside of the plane had me rolling on the floor.
