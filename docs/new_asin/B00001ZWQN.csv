1247548,2,B00001ZWQN,"I had seen this before, but remembered very little about ""Blood Feast"". I know it's status as the ""first splatter film"", and figured with Halloween right around the corner it would be a good time to revisit Herschell Gordon Lewis' film.

Clocking in at just over an hour, ""Blood Feast"" is actually a slog to get through. Imagine an Ed Wood film with the gore quotient upped. Poor acting, poor direction, a punishingly awful score and a thread-bare plot make for a pretty dull movie viewing experience. The entire film is based on the idea that an Egyptian caterer is rolling around town slicing off pieces of various girls to use in a sacrificial feast to the goddess Ishtar.

The only draw to this film is the gore angle, and while it must have been pretty shocking in 1963, it just doesn't hold up today. I would give this a higher score if it were ""so over the top it was funny"", and there are a few scenes where I chuckled, but overall the film is just lifeless and dull.

I you're a die hard horror fan, then I recommend giving ""Blood Feast"" a view, if nothing else than to see the original ""splatter"" movie, but for anyone else, give this one a pass.",1411948800,,1156,4.392523364485982

Ramseys is trying to bring about some god or something and is killing girls in gruesome ways to cook them up for an Egyptian Feast. The sets literally look like cardboard. All of the characters from the cops to the victims were complete idiots. Even the make-up and costumes are ridiculous. The script was so bad and the acting was so stiff, its laughable. How can something some bad be so entertaining? Im not sure if Hershel Gordon Lewis meant for this to be tongue in cheek humor or what. I know he is a schlock auteur in the ranks of Ed Wood and Lloyd Kaufman and was probably working on a shoe-string budget. I do love these type of movies though.

It is considered the first splatter film ever. It is also one of the better Herschell Gordon Lewis films. It is a true classic and it may also be the first ever ""knife movie"" in that it is one of the first films where a killer stalks and kills victims. Released in 1963, it foreshadowed the slasher genre and the increasingly gory movies that would become part of the horror pantheon in the 1980's. Fuad Ramses is the serial killer that kills women in this film and, like Norman Bates before him, one of the granddaddys of the slasher movie.

1247557,5,B00001ZWQN,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

Ok, first the Plot, which I find ( contrary to what allot of other reviewers here have stated ) is actually pretty clever and creative, . .. albiet in a very campy and absurd kind of way.  A deranged fanatical devotee to a malevolent bloodthirsty ancient Egyptian Goddess SLASH professional caterer ( with Mr. Spock eyebrows and very unconvincingly greyed hair )plots to enact the horrendous Blood Feast of Ishtar ( most thoroughly explained in the context of a particularly lurid classroom lecture ) using one of his impending professional engagements ( a young ladies birthday party ) as the scene for this gruesome ceremonial ritual!!!!  Thus he goes about on a rampage of slaughter!!!! . .. plucking and gathering the ""ingredients"" for this projected banquet of carnage from the ripe and shapely young bodies of numerous comely young dames!!! He stalks, spies and battens upon his selected nubile prey when they're isolated and vulnerable and often even scantily dressed or naked ( in places like swimming pools, the beach, motel rooms and even the victims bathroom )!! One victim has her legs chopped off while she's engaged in a bubble bath. Another, a sweet wholesome all american girl type with her boyfriend, has the top of her head cut off ( sort of resembling the trepanning by helicopter blade scene in Dawn of the Dead ) and her brains extracted ( the fiendish assailant holding them in his hands and gazing fondly at them like a precious prize )!!  Another, this one a trashy drunken old broad who answers the door in her underwear when the killer simply knocks, gets gagged with the fiends fingers and has her freakishly large tongue ripped out ( again holding and examining it while gloating admiringly )!!  Another has her face hacked away!! . .. another is lashed to death!!

At this point let's delve into some history, which is quite relevant and crucial in regard to THIS film as it's commonly haild as the First Gore film. This flick was made and initially released in the early sixties. And though it DID, reportedly and undoubtedly, have definite impact on those who saw it way back THEN, it was hardly an immediate ""blockbuster"".  It really attained popular status nearly twenty years later after ""splatter"" had become an established movie genre and pop-cultural phenomenon. When publications like Fangoria, Gore Gazett and Psychotronic and authors like John McCarty ( of the book 'Splatter Movies ) and Michael Weldon ( The Psychotronic Film Encyclopedia ) had declared it a ""classic"" and touted it as ""the Original Gore film"" and a flourishing young breed of contemporary low budget horror filmmakers and popular cult directors ( like namely and most notably John Waters and Frank Henenlotter ) had cited it as a nostalgic favorite and creative influence. Thus it was successfully revived on the late seventies Midnight Movie circuit and then, in the early 80's, made it's phenomenal debut on home video ( becoming one of the most popular movies of the early home vid revolution ).  However, way back in 1963 ( the year of this flicks initial release ) there was no ""splatter"" genre ( the most graphically bloody thing on screen thus far being the shower scene from Psycho, or maybe even the early gothic Hammer horror flicks which were previously considered fairly gruesome ), . .. thus, in the words of creator Hershel Gordon Lewis, the flick rather caught viewers ""unawares"" to understate it quite drastically.  It's depicted gore ( for which it's legendary ) was really something else in it's time and STILL holds it's own. By today's standards it's pretty simple stuff like graphic close ups of croped bloody meaty stumps and exposed intestines ( uncommon in movies and quite horrifying at that time ) and lots of dripping blood ( not flowing, gushing, squirting or spraying mind you like in more modern splatter flicks, .. just dripping ). In addition to the aforementioned scenes of carnage, there are also scenes of a long wiggling strip of flesh being deposited into a boiling pot, a knife plunged into a girls chest and her heart graphically removed from the cavity, a rather kinky flogging ( ""Give yourself over to the goddess!!!"" ) with whats apparently a blood-soaked clothesline ( what I find to be the worst effect in the movie ), and a severed leg being roasted in an oven.  I have no doubt that this stuff WAS truly shocking and that it knocked viewers the hell out back in the early sixties! And, though numerous more elaborately gory flicks have of course been made since ( like Evil Dead, The Exorcist, The Thing, Dead Alive ) and despite how crude the special effects techniques seem today ( hell, they could probably depict someone being turned completely inside out through their anus in a flick made today, . .. and probably already even have, though I'm not certain of it ? ), the stuff in this flick is STILL sick, tasteless, pretty graphic and does look gross. In fact this, one must consider, is the type of old cheaply made flick in which they actually use REAL stuff ( raw meat, intestines, liver, .. maybe ketchup for blood though ) gotten from a local butcher shop which I think makes it even GROSSER than that stuff in movies made today!
 At times this flick, I dare say, is even genuinely creepy and disturbing ( however again in a campy and ludicrous kind of way ), like particularly a scene where a surviving victim in a hospital with half her face hacked off gives her hysterical testimony to some cops ( ""Wild eyes!!  . .. He had WILD EYES!!!!!"" ).

However, rather than its gore, I think that Blood Feasts best quality and real lasting charm is truly and ultimately its HUMOR.  This is really a pretty FUNNY flick!!  This flick has several truly funny scenes and some hysterical screenwriting, and I personally have no doubt that it was expressly intended to be humorous ( ""gallows humor"" as I believe it's called ). Scenes such as when the killer attempts to slaughter the ditzy ""maiden of honer"" during her party in the kitchen of her home with the load of party guests present in the next room and using the counter as the ""sacrificial altar"", .. Or when the killer is accidentally crushed to death in a garbage truck ( in which he desperately took to hiding while fleeing some chasing cops ) and one of the two detectives from the Bureau of Homicide ( who seem to have most of the best lines of dialogue in the film ) exclaims to the horrified and confused garbageman ""Pal, you don't know it yet, but you've just done this city the biggest service it's EVER had!!"" and then says to an officer ""Notify headquarters that the killer is no more. He died a fitting death, . .. for the garbage he was!!"". Or when one of them recounts a surviving victims slight description of the killer ""He caught a glimpse of grey hair and strange glowing eyes"". Or when after the patient in the hospital expires due to the strain of giving an account from her hospital bed, one investigator exclaims ""Poor kid!! She never had a chance!!"" or, after having uncovered the killers identity motive and intent, urgently exclaims to an officer ""Get on the phone immediately!!  Contact the Friedmont residence and tell them to hold him till we get there!! And for God's sake, tell them not to EAT anything!!!"". Add to this a score of what sounds like really cheesy organ music from an old melodramatic soap opera !
Of course viewers in 1963 were probably too overwhelmed by the explicit gore to recognize the humor in this flick , . .. or, put another way, they were too busy screaming, vomiting, fainting or whatever to be laughing, .. but still I think THAT to be it's true lasting appeal and what truly accounts for it's long term ongoing cult popularity.

If taken as a sick comedy rather than as a serious horror film, then Blood Feast can be a truly awesome and enjoyable viewing experience. Damndest thing about this old flick, . .. it's almost as if it was parodying the gore genre before it even was a genre or, put another way, parodying the gore genre while inventing it at the same time!!!",1354579200,,8065,4.684322033898305

1247559,5,B00001ZWQN,"best horror movies ever. Start with the worst. 1) acting. Never have I ever seen acting as bad as this. One scene where the police detectives are talking at the police station one of the actors is reading off the script off his desk. One character named Tony couldn't cry if someone else cried for him. Mrs. Freemont acts like she is trying out for a high school play every time she opens her mouth. 2) very bad screen play. The story line was written for creatures with very low I.Q's If anyone can't follow this one. Something is very wrong here. 3) bad directing for the actors. One woman at the first comes in her apartment, turns on her radio, hear about a bunch of women getting murdered then instead of leaving the radio on so she can hear music she turns it off and goes and gets in her bubble bath so the killer however he gets in her apartment can go to her and chop her up while she is bathing.  The radio was ONLY turned on for us the people watching the movie so we would know what the plot is )s Now for the best. Blood, Gore, Blood, Gore and more Blood, Gore. That is where 95% of the movies budget went. For its time a classic. I love the film for that. H.G. Lewis was master of gore. five stars for blood and gore only",1318118400,,1235,4.124481327800829
1247560,5,B00001ZWQN,"Herschell Gordon Lewis made Horror history with 1963's BLOOD FEAST, widely considered to be the first ""gore"" film. In the years before the MPAA, filmmakers were only limited from showing excessive nudity on-screen. With no rules preventing anyone in the movie industry from depicting gratuitous violence or horrifying bodily dismemberment, H.G. Lewis and business partner David F. Friedman embarked on a series of films that exploited these loose regulations in an attempt to compete with the major studio releases in the drive-in circuit. The two did not ease in to this newly established genre with just a few missing limbs or a severed head, but (literally) covered the screen in blood and butchery from start to finish. This simply had never been done before, and even to this day, BLOOD FEAST continues to serve as one of the most shocking and gruesome films in the genre.

Mrs. Fremont is throwing a dinner party for her daughter's engagement, so in order to impress her guests, she has hired the exotic caterer Fuad Ramses to put on an extravagant feast! What she doesn't know is that Fuad has worked up a special menu made from bits and pieces of the missing girls from around town, which he will be serving as the main course in an Egyptian blood feast to appease the goddess Ishtar!

PSYCHO, this is not; Lewis' listless direction shows all of the style and finesse of an early stag film (another genre with which he was fondly familiar). BLOOD FEAST tastefully implies nothing, and instead plasters the screen in one lurid image after another, using as few camera set-ups and shots as possible for the minimal amount of coverage provided. Lewis and Friedman would tap Playboy playmate Connie Mason to star as the beautiful young bride-to-be, who would return for their follow-up 2000 MANIACS the next year. Mason, along with her fellow cast members, produce truly horrible performances, but the roles are so poorly acted and outrageously over-the-top that they give way to the highest level of camp. As if the subject matter was not forward enough, Lewis' editing clearly demonstrates his lack of concern with plotting or characterization, as the camera holds on the disfigured remains of Fuad's victims much longer than it ever does for any of the characters in the film.

Using gallons of red paint and nearly an entire butcher's shop of animal entrails, BLOOD FEAST offers everything from a beach full of splattered brains, to a torn out tongue, a hacked off leg, and more in eye-popping color film stock! While this may not seem like much, the method in which the murders are filmed and the absolutely absurd amount of bright-red blood make these moments as memorable as they are completely revolting.

Herschell Gordon Lewis, the ""Godfather of Gore,"" has left behind a bloody trail of influence in the wake of this seminal shocker. BLOOD FEAST has had a profound effect on countless young filmmakers, and will continue to live on in the annals of Horror for many years to come.

1247561,5,B00001ZWQN,"Okay so let's just put it on the table right from the start: ""Blood Feast"" has cheesy characters, a B-movie level plot and is hardly over an hour. BUT! For those seeking low-budget, high-quality entertainment, this is a movie for your eyes to feast upon. Being well over 40 years old, it's interesting to think how gory and vicious this was considered back in the early '60s. Technically, this can be considered the first slasher film, and is DEFINITELY the first splatter film, so for the true horror fans, this is an essential view!

For fans of the cheesy yet enjoyable horror films, this one will be a real gem. Despite the acting and writing, (although I thought the bad acting made the villain twice as enjoyable,) the low-budget aspect makes it humorous, and the gore is, of course, awesome! Plus, the fact that the movie is pretty short makes it all the more enjoyable, because it suits the general feel of the film. Don't expect something big and beautiful, but be prepared for some low-budget gold! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1256256000,,1040,4.683060109289618
1247562,1,B00001ZWQN,"Blood Feast (Herschell Gordon Lewis, 1963)

Sometimes I wonder why I still watch Herschell Gordon Lewis movies. While I understand that Lewis' movies were the progenitors, pretty much singlehandedly, of the entire gore film genre. But just because something is important or influential, it doesn't necessarily follow that it's good. And when it comes right down to it, Lewis was the Edward D. Wood, Jr., of gore.

In this forgettable exercise, an Egyptian caterer is trying to resurrect a goddess by killing his clients and using their body parts to make a sort of modern Frankenstein's monster. He's almost done, just needs a few last bits from his latest client. Meanwhile, a couple of idiotic police detectives try to apprehend him before he turns his latest client into, well, a goddess.

Lewis' movies are, every last one of them I've seen, marked with three traits: horrendous gore effects about as realistic as one might find in a catsup fight, acting so horrid it should be used in acting classes as examples of what not to do when in front of a camera, and oddly compelling soundtracks. Whatever else Herschell Gordon Lewis did not have, he had great taste in music. (I still have his rendition of ""Old Joe Clark"", from the Two Thousand Maniacs! soundtrack, on my mp3 player, because it's awesome. Nothing else about the movie is, but that version of that song? Priceless.) If you're stuck for anything else to do if you find yourself watching this, close your eyes and just listen to the music, because as with all Lewis' movies, there's nothing else to recommend it.

1247563,1,B00001ZWQN,"Don't fall for the hype of some of the fan boy reviews of this movie, it is a poor slasher movie, poor gore movie, and just a bad overall film. Don't waste your money on it, it's so bad you would never think of this movie as gore, the blood looks like red paint, it is also very short at 67 minites, not that matters, since you will be glad it's over. there are alot of other horror films you can buy that are far surperior to this movie, it's not even funny in an Ed Wood, kind of way.",1241049600,,486,3.87
1247564,5,B00001ZWQN,"Released in 1964, H.G. Lewis's ""Blood Feast"" owns the distinction of being the world's first ""gore"" movie, i.e., the first horror film to show death and dismemberment in gruesome ""blood color."" Audiences were shocked, but they loved it, and the film was a huge hit at drive-in theaters. (Aside from the grindhouses, most indoor theaters declined to show the film, as it was considered too distasteful.)

Grisly as the film is, it's hard to imagine anybody actually being scared by it. With its obviously low budget, awful acting, and crackpot story about a cannibalistic Egyptian caterer with the absurd name of Fuad Ramses, ""Blood Feast"" seems more hilarious than horrifying, yet audiences in 1964 were seriously freaked out by it. Even today, over four decades later, this offbeat gem of cult horror cinema remains weirdly, inexplicably entertaining, perhaps because it is the seminal exponent of the almost hypnotically bizarre sensibilities that would come to distinguish Lewis's films from those of every other exloitation filmmaker in the business.

Lewis was a former literature professor, advertising executive, and part-time independent filmmaker who shot many of his films in south Florida in order to escape Chicago's brutal winters. The sphinx's head in the opening titles of ""Blood Feast"" was actually an architectural decoration of the Suez Motel in the Sunny Isles section of North Miami Beach, where Lewis and crew frequently stayed while shooting their epics. Till recently, the Suez Motel and its sphinx still existed on Collins Avenue in North Miami Beach, and over the years had become something of a mecca for cult film fanatics due to its association with Lewis's films. Until, that is, the old motor court was razed to make way for one of Donald Trump's new luxury condo developments.

""Blood Feast"" featured Playboy playmate Connie Mason (1963's Playmate of the Year) in her first starring role as the ingenuous damsel-in-distress. She was hired by Lewis's partner, David F. Friedman, who felt that she was ""decorative""--and also exploitable, on account of her Playboy fame. Unfortunately, director Lewis quickly became frustrated with her lack of acting skills. As the latter-day drive-in movie critic, Joe Bob Briggs put it, Connie Mason ""couldn't act her way out of a potato sack if there was a rattlesnake in there with her.""

Another unintentionally hilarious highlight of the film is the appearance of Scott H. Hall, who played the police captain to Bill Kerwin's (aka, ""Thomas Wood"") detective. Hall was a famous carnival talker (you never call them ""barkers""), whose spiel had been recorded by the Smithsonian Institute as part of their American Circus archives. Hall was also a friend of ""Blood Feast"" producer David F. Friedman, who persuaded Hall to play the part of the police captain after the actor originally cast in the part reportedly flew into a drunken rage and attacked screenwriter Allison Louise Downe after reading a final draft of the script.

Hall had many talents, but acting wasn't one of them. Lewis told him, ""If you can't emote, just shout your lines,"" So he did. Trooper that he was, Hall was also incapable of memorizing dialogue, so he wrote his lines on the palms of his hands, and can clearly be seen ""reading his palm"" in several scenes.

Encouraged by the success of ""Blood Feast,"" Lewis went on to make his most famous film, ""Two Thousand Maniacs,"" and subsequently churned out a whole slew of sleazy, low-budget gore and exploitation flicks, all of which were suffused with his unique brand of tasteless lunatic humor. In 1972, he made his most ferocious gore film, ""The Gore-Gore Girls,"" a movie that many people still find unwatchably offensive due to the extreme, misogynistic violence. All of Lewis's previously films had been released unrated, and ""The Gore-Gore Girls"" was, ironically, the first film that Lewis had ever submitted to the MPAA for a rating. Lewis's subsequent censorship battles over the film were sufficiently frustrating that he temporarily abandoned filmmaking altogether in order to focus on his advertising business.

Years later, Lewis was invited to speak at a retrospective of his films, during which one of the attendees asked him whether he considered himself an artist--to which he replied, with a mixture of amusement and astonishment, ""Have you seen my films?""

Herschell Gordon Lewis currently lives in south Florida, and is a prolific writer and marketing consultant who still occasionally makes outrageous films.

In 2002, Lewis and his former partner, Dave Friedman, were persuaded to helm a ""Blood Feast"" sequel entitled ""Blood Feast 2: All You Can Eat."" Despite the film's extreme gore, deliberately campy tone, and an amusing cameo by longtime Lewis fan and gonzo director John Waters (as a priest!), the film was poorly received by critics and fans, many of whom blamed the movie's troubles on reported creative differences between the producers and the Lewis / Friedman team. The film received a limited theatrical release, after which it was distributed directly to DVD for the home entertainment market. Two versions of the DVD were released: an unrated version which Blockbuster Video refused to carry; and a milder, R-rated version in which the gory, climactic face-ripping scene was removed altogether.

Undaunted by his experience with ""Blood Feast 2,"" the indefatigable Lewis is reportedly planning to lens several other original films, including a project called ""Herschell Gordon Lewis's Grim Fairy Tales,"" and another, tentatively entitled, ""Win, Lose, or Die.""

No word on the status of those productions.

Whether you love his movies or hate them, Herschell Gordon Lewis is rightly known as the ""Godfather of Gore."" He is the inventor of that most existentialist of genres, the ""splatter"" movie, and is one of the last surviving icons of exploitation cinema, having directed such outrageous grindhouse classics as ""She-Devils on Wheels,"" and ""Just for the Hell of It.""

If you're a film snob, don't bother with ""Blood Feast,"" or any of Lewis's movies, because you won't get them. On the other hand, if you have a gallows sense of humor and an appreciation for the absurd, you may very well enjoy the guilty pleasures of Lewis's subversive, backhanded genius.",1190937600,,6277,5.166338582677166
1247565,4,B00001ZWQN,"Blood feast isn't what you'd call a ""good"" movie, but it is an important movie whether you like it or not.  Onscreen gore is rather commonplace now, and though usually associated with the horror genre, has found it's way into many other genres over the years.  Hell, look at Passion of the Christ or Monty Python and the Holy Grail(or Meaning of Life for that matter).  Gore is everywhere and we have Mr. Herschell Gordon Lewis and his opus Blood feast to thank for it.  The paper thin plot consists of a lunatic caterer who goes around killing women and stealing their body parts as ingredients for a special Egyptian feast.....A BLOOD FEAST!!!  This feast is part of an ancient ceremony that will resurrect an old goddess named Ishtar.  Fuad Ramses, our lunatic caterer, has suckered a family into going for this feast(they don't know what's all in it though).  His plan is to sacrifice the daughter(who's going out with one of the detectives on the case) and have the entire party take part in the feast, thus resurrecting Ishtar to......well, to do whatever Ishtar does.  This flimsy plot merely works as a way to move from one bloody murder scene to the next.  Though there are a handful of bloody kills, this film isn't quite the gorefest you may think.  For the time I'm sure it was just completely insane and shocking, which was the intention.  Some of it still looks rather gruesome.  Most of it consists of ""aftermath"" kinda stuff.  You won't actually see Fuad hacking off a woman's arm, but you'll see him holding the bloody severed arm in his hands.  Today it's easy to laugh at the horrendous acting and primitive gore effects(though they aren't as bad as you may expect considering the budget), but back in 1963 I'm sure people were in too much of a state of shock at the images they were seeing to notice the bad acting.  Lewis has said that no one had ever walked out of one of his films because of bad acting or dialogue.  The most important thing to remember about Blood feast as well as all of Lewis' gore films is that it's all meant to be fun.  I recently had a chat with Lewis(that's right, mofos! I did!) and he said that these films were never meant to be taken as serious horror films-they were always done with tongue planted in cheek and you were supposed to laugh at them.  Essentially he made gory comedies.  So even though Lewis' films will always be under the ""horror"" label, they were never meant to frighten or horrify.  Sure they were meant to shock and gross out, but Lewis wanted you to have a few laughs along the way, and depending on how twisted your sense of humor is, I think Blood Feast achieves that quite nicely.  Excellent commentary too.",1188432000,,2683,4.536382536382536
1247566,4,B00001ZWQN,"A crazed caterer who secretly worships an Egyptian goddess named Ishtar, he goes around the city seeking fresh young virgin girls then murders them especially hacks them to pieces so he can use their parts to appease his goddess. The police seemed baffled and disgusted by these strange and vile murders for they investigate, a mother is planning on having a party as she invites the caterer over as he has some plans in his twisted mind to appease Ishtar.

This movie went on to become the first ever gore flick to hit the screen, there'd been nothing like it before in cinema at the time. But when this movie hit theaters in july of 1962, audiences were appalled and disgusted by this flick for it made a fortune and gained infamy thus creating a landmark horror flick for being the first gore flick. The acting is kind of bad especially the script writing but there's some good if a little dated gore effects here in this movie like the gross tounge ripping scene, though it may be kind of laughable by today's standards this movie will remain an important flick in the genre for starting gore flicks and made H.G. Lewis a household name.

1247570,3,B00001ZWQN,"This is one of those few movies where everything that everyone says about it is precisely true: Utterly barebones production, flatly pathetic acting, stilted and pointless dialogue, and lots and lots of ultra-phony gore.  Of course, this is pretty undisputedly the first real gore film, so horror fans pretty much have to see this.  And, even if it weren't so important historically it would be worth seeing anyway, cause it's pretty damn cool either way.

Fortunately, in making the first gore film they didn't go halfway.  Sure, there are tons of films which are gorier then it now, it's still gory enough that if it were redone, shot for shot with realistic, modern effects, it wouldn't be allowed an R rating in a million years.  You got flaying, leg severing, heart extracting, tongue ripping, brain, um, snatching etc.  And, while the gore effects are incredibly dated, they aren't quite as cheap and old as I would have imagined.  The blood itself actually holds up fairly well, and looks better than much of the stage blood you'd see over the next 20 years or so.  It's actually red!  It is also delightfully shameless, perpetually leering at the simplistic effects in a way that makes Fulci look almost reserved by comparison.  For example, fairly late in the film there is a 42 second pan over a flaying victim. (i.e. someone just covered with fake blood)  42 seconds may not sound that long when I just say it, but when you're actually watching it it's pretty damn funny, and seems to go on forever.  It's also got some odd quirks, such as how virtually all the violence is performed in utter silence, with no sound effects, only music.  It manages to make these scenes somehow poignant, in spite of the overall laughable nature of the project.

The film only gets 3 stars because much of the terrible acting and dialogue grows somewhat tiresome after a while.  There are only a few topics:  The cops whine about how they can't catch the mad butcher who is killing women, and stealing their body parts, and the civilains whine about there's a killer out there, and then reflect happily on the party they plan to have that Saturaday. (Turns out that the guy who's catering the party, Fuad Ramses, is the killer, and is gonna feed them the parts he stole.  What a coincidence.)  The directing is also amusingly flat.  The camera hardly ever moves, nor do the actors.  They just  stand there, statue-stiff, delivering there lines.  It's also got a fun soundtrack, with endless thumping tympani and cheesy organs and such.  Lotsa people are irritated by it, but I find it quite amusing.

Yeah, you know if you wanna see this or not.  So do it.

1247571,4,B00001ZWQN,"When I first heard of this movie, I didn't know what to expect. Sure the description of the movie says ""nothing so appaling in the annals of horror"" and it's extremely shocking and gory. In my mind I was thinking this movie was made in 1963 how gory can it be? Well to say the least I was impressed and suprised by how gorey the killing scenes are.

 Mrs. Fremont wants to do something special for her daughters' party. Knowing her daughter is deeply interested in egyptian culture she hires Fuad Ramses to cater the party. He begins preparing the ""Blood Feast"" by murdering young women and taking parts of they're body to add to the feast.

 The acting is pretty bad, it's actually comical, the story is pretty weak as well and yes the blood looks like bright red paint, but come on, this movie was made over 40 years ago, I'm suprised this was even shown at any drive in movie back then. Sure the effects are dated but no gore hound should be disappointed! As some have said before me. This movie is where it all started.

1247576,5,B00001ZWQN,"In 1963 Herschell Gordon Lewis, an independent filmmaker best known for making limited release ""cutie"" pictures, changed forever the face of American cinema when he released ""Blood Feast."" This film, as low budget as you could possibly get, heralded the era of the gore film. While it would be quite some time before Hollywood caught on to the fact that certain segments of the movie going public hungered for films containing nauseating scenes of explicit violence, H.G. Lewis took one look at the receipts for ""Blood Feast"" and decided he better quickly make another movie similar to this one. What followed was a series of gruesome zero budget shockers, films like ""The Wizard of Gore,"" ""A Taste of Blood,"" ""2000 Maniacs,"" ""Color Me Blood Red,"" and ""The Gruesome Twosome."" Lewis lensed the downright offensive ""The Gore-Gore Girls"" before retiring from the film business in 1972 in order to devote his time to join the advertising industry. It wasn't until 2002 that the director returned to form with ""Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat,"" a movie which proved beyond a doubt that the Godfather of Gore still has what it takes to gross out an audience.
""Blood Feast"" introduces us to a cast of intriguing characters set against lush, expensive set pieces crafted by the best designers money could buy in 1963. Moreover, the actors employed by Lewis represent the cream of Hollywood talent, surpassing the likes of Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando, Katherine Hepburn, and nearly any other legendary thespians imaginable.
Yeah right.
This is zero budget schlock, folks, the sort of movie you would make on a home movie camera if you didn't think your parents would ground you for wasting film stock. What we get in ""Blood Feast"" is an insane Egyptian caterer named Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold) lurching around slaughtering local ladies in order to prepare a feast made out of their body parts to fulfill some sick ritual to the goddess Ishtar. Ramses intends to present his bloody course at the wedding party of a brainless young lady (played by Connie Mason, an actress with the allure of a speed bump) until the local cops step in and end his bloody spree (Lewis regular Bill Kerwin plays one of the police officers). There isn't anything more to it than that. Well, there are a few killings, gruesome little scenes like the trepanning on the beach, the tongue extraction, and the flashback to the Ishtar ritual where a guy in some cheesy get up removes what looks like a heart from some woman's chest. But you're not really interested in any of those scenes, are you?
Of course you are! The ONLY reason a viewer would submit themselves to the agony of a H.G. Lewis film is to see the gore! The incredibly lame acting, the wooden pacing, the slipshod editing, and the brain numbing dialogue certainly wouldn't pack in the crowds. Yes, the gore is a lot of fun here, with some of Lewis's best grue scenes ever gracing the hallowed halls of ""Blood Feast."" The drooping tongue alone should secure this guy a place in the pantheon of gore cinema. Still, fans that know and love Herschell like I do get a kick out of the other aspects of his films. I loved the soundtrack to this schlockfest, a mix of monotonous drumbeats, strings, and hypercheesy flashes of organ during those scenes where something ""important"" happens. As good as the soundtrack sounds here (!), the acting really grabbed my attention. Kerwin gives one of his worst performances here as the cop who wouldn't recognize a clue if it came up and tore his tongue out. Connie Mason turns in a bravura performance as the young airhead whose mother hires Fuad Ramses to cater her wedding party. Sweet, seductive Connie couldn't act her way into a paper bag, let alone out of one. If you can keep a straight face when you notice her reading dialogue off of cue cards, you are a bigger man than I. And that guy crying on the beach! Oh man, my friends, OH MAN!

I guess we should not express too much surprise that the first gore film ever made looks like the mess that is ""Blood Feast."" An unpopular genre like this one would never draw big buck investors or heavy studio support from Hollywood. Even today, the gore film--an extreme gore film--tends to rely on a miniscule budget compared to most other movies in different genres. After viewing many of Lewis's films I still cannot figure out how in the heck he convinced people to play these atrocities anywhere in the country. I understand the lure of a buck provides incentives aplenty to screen even the most egregious tripe, but the sordid gore in a Lewis film pushes the envelope beyond the bursting point. The director has stated on several occasions that censors did hack his films to pieces in some regions, but many prints made it through unscathed. How? In 1963? I wish I could go back in time and see ""Blood Feast"" in a theater just so I could watch the audience reactions.
The DVD edition of ""Blood Feast"" is one of the best Lewis discs available. You get an entertaining commentary track with Lewis and his partner David Friedman, stills aplenty, nearly fifty minutes of silent outtakes, a trailer, and an odd short film about carving meat (no joke!) starring Bill Kerwin and Harvey Korman (!). Parts of the film look magnificent for such an ancient motion picture, while other parts look like they went through a washing machine. Still, the gore comes through in bright color, no amount of poor picture quality could mar the ghastly acting, and the soundtrack sounds great. Get it, watch it, love it!",1076112000,,5509,4.714730290456432
1247577,3,B00001ZWQN,"Blood Feast, the brain child of goremeister Herschell Gordon Lewis is one of the most important horrible movies ever made.  Without question, the movie really, really stinks in more ways than I would have thought possible, but this, ladies and gentlemen, 1963's Blood Feast, gave birth to the blood and gore genre we know and love today.  One man, H.G. Lewis, decided he was going to make a statement; he was going to shock people; he was going to give people gore as they had never seen it before; nothing could stop him, not the atrocious script, not the mind bogglingly bad actors, not his insistence to never shoot a scene more than three times no matter how awful it came out, and not the lack of any funds whatsoever; as long as Lewis could afford barrels of Karo syrup, he was happy.  Looking back now, it's pretty hard to believe that this level of gore actually shocked people in the early 1960s, but history tells us that it did.  Believe me, we've come a long way since then, but it was H.G. Lewis who blazed the trail we tread today.
On the face of it, Blood Feast would seem to have some good things going for it: a catered feast secretly prepared with human blood and body parts, the influence of an ancient Egyptian religious rite, a number of dead bodies, and even a Playboy playmate in the form of Connie Mason (Miss June 1963).  Despite all this, though, the movie drops an H bomb from the very first moment.  Plot-wise, you have a series of gruesome murders striking fear all over town, with the killer bagging nubile young women at a rate of 3-4 a week.  From each victim he takes a different body part (each time it looks like intestines to me, yet it can be an eyeball, an arm, a heart, whatever).  The killer needs these ""ingredients"" so that he can bring the blood-thirsty goddess Ishtar back to life.  The police are clueless, and I do mean clueless; they smoke cigarettes and sit at their desks as hard as they possibly can - heck, the chief even bangs his hand on the desk every now and again - but they just can't come up with a single clue (largely because they can't recognize a clue if it falls on top of them like a ton of bricks).  Meanwhile, a wealthy woman is planning for her daughter's birthday celebration and, as a special surprise, she hires Fuad Ramses to cater the party.  Ramses promises her an authentic Egyptian feast, and this idea goes over like gangbusters because daughter Suzette just so happens to be attending weekly lectures on ancient Egyptian cults.  Suzette also happens to be the girl of one of the town's only two detectives, so you see how all of this starts fitting together.
While the gore is pretty unspectacular from our modern viewpoint, Lewis succeeds quite well at times.  We don't actually get to see the actual killings, of course, but there are plenty of shots of our killer pulling out parts of human bodies in his blood-soaked hands, mixing up a batch of young woman blood soup, hacking off limbs and such, and of course cooking such delicacies.  Lewis makes a point of admiring his gruesome handiwork, oftentimes panning the camera slowly across the whole body of a mutilated, blood-spattered, thoroughly dead victim.  There is one scene in particular that impressed me, involving the appearance of a girl who has a sunken cavity in her chest where her heart used to be.  By and large, though, the gore is quite campy to us modern-day horror fans, but one should try to appreciate it in its proper context.
I can't conclude without addressing the performances of the actors and actresses involved with this movie.  This may well be the worst assembly of hopeless actors I've ever seen.  I don't know where Lewis found these people.  You can't just take people off the street and have them perform this badly; it takes years of devoted practice to become this bad a performer.  Lewis must have had some of these kids in a bad actor's training camp from the time they could talk in order to coax such wooden, ridiculously bad performances out of them.  Then there is the terrible music, which continually takes one of three forms: endless repetition of two drum beats, the playing of a kazoo-like instrument, and terrible pipe organ music of the type that worked well alongside silent movies but does not work at all in this film.
Basically, Blood Feast is a horribly campy, low-budget, sub-B horror movie that now serves as hilarious entertainment which can not be taken the least bit seriously.  Were it not for its importance as the first true blood and gore film, this would be just another forgettable trek through the dark forest of bad horror movies.  Its historic importance to the genre, however, makes it a film every gorehound must watch and pay homage to in some way.",1070928000,,4749,4.600710900473934

It goes like this: a dingbat society matron hires a sleazy looking caterer with pointed eyebrows to cater a party she's giving for her daughter. The ""caterer"" is obsessed with Egyptian themes and hisses at the woman, ""Have you ever had an Egyptian FEASSSST?"" Now, would you let that fool cater a party for your nubile daughter?  Sure you would. And so does the matron. The wacko wants to resurrect an ancient Egyptian goddess and to do so he has to perform the ritual ""Blood Feast"" which will contain the hacked up body parts of other nubile young women. So he gets to work straight away. Every available young woman in eyeshot (and somehow they're everywhere) gets butchered all over the place. The gore is mostly ""posed"" by models covered in fake blood and guts. There are no production values and even less acting. The heroine is played by one-time Playboy model Connie Mason who actually worked with Lewis AGAIN(!) in ""Two-Thousand Maniacs"". Apparently once was not enough----go figure.

1247581,3,B00001ZWQN,"Back in the dark days of the 1980's, Margaret Thatcher's stern and puritanical government decided that badly made low-budget horror movies were interfering with the British public's ability to maintain a stiff upper lip, and promptly banned them all. They became popularly known as ""video nasties"" and VHS copies of the best (or worst) of them became much sought after in the UK.
This is one of the oldest and most notorious of the nasties, directed (if that's the right word) by HG Lewis, who pretty much started the whole gore/splatter movie genre single handed, way back in 1963. I love this film even though it has to be said that most people would probably walk several miles to avoid seeing it. ""Bloodfeast"" is definitely in the ""so bad it's good"" category as well as being in seriously poor taste. It's basically an exploitation movie aimed at the teenage drive-in audience of the time, with the added ingredients of serial killing/mutilation, countless gallons of fake blood, and one very large tongue....
It was obviously made on a shoestring budget: the camerawork, ""special effects"" and ""musical"" soundtrack are all extremely poor, and as if that wasn't bad enough, the plot and dialogue are (to put it mildly) also very weak and the ""acting"" is absolutely hopeless.
The movie stars Playboy playmate Connie Mason as a student called Suzette who has a fascination for ancient Egypt. It begins with a radio news item about murders of young women in Suzette's small American town, and we soon discover the weird looking culprit - a deranged Egyptian cultist who also owns an ""exotic"" catering company and goes by the unlikely name of Fuad Ramses. Suzette's mother decides to hire Fuad to serve up an Egyptian meal for her daughter's upcoming 21st birthday and that's when the fun begins....
Fuad has been preparing an ancient Egyptian ""blood feast"", whose main aim is to resurrect the goddess Ishtar and whose main ingredients are various body parts of young women (hence the killings). In preparation for Suzette's birthday surprise he not only intensifies his murderfest (and clearly enjoys his work!) but aims to make Suzette his final victim. The resulting gore looks fairly mild by today's standards and is about as unrealistic as it's possible to get, but it comes thick and fast while the tomato ketchup keeps flowing very freely indeed. Fuad's plans are eventually foiled, but not before one completely over the top scene in which a victim has her tongue ripped out, and the fact that the tongue is so huge that it's obviously not human in origin only enhances one of ""Bloodfeast's"" many moments of accidental greatness.
The movie has been very well transferred to dvd, and this edition also features some great extras: masses of outtakes, commentary from Lewis and producer David Friedman (full of hilarious anecdotes about this and other movies), a quaint film about the joys of carving meat and more....
Encouraged by the success of ""Bloodfeast"", Lewis soon followed it up with the equally tasteless ""2000 Maniacs"" and ""Colour me blood red"" (the three films became known as the ""blood trilogy"") and if you like ""Bloodfeast"" you'll enjoy them all.

And yet, the strange thing  about this movie is that once you watch it, you have this strange affinity  for it.  it's so bad, that you end up liking it!  The acting is horrible  (except for Fuad Ramses's line:  ""... an Egyptian Feast!!!"")  the  writing is just a bad, it sounds like they filmed some of the scenes in a  tin box (the police station) and how old is that detective?  and he's going  out with her?  Yikes.  Also, the music is the most eerie thing i've ever  heard in a movie.  it's always there.  did you ever notice that they only  have one car in the movie?  Everyone drives the same car!

1247588,4,B00001ZWQN,"First off this film is only for those with a love of really bad movies. Not Hollywood pieces of crap,but ultra low buget,""Hey at least the movie got made"",kind of way. Ed Wood in color baically. Now having said  that,on we go.
Terriblely acted,written,directed,and any other thing that  goes into making a movie. But whatever you can say about it,it ain't  boring. And it actually delivers what it promises. GORE.Which is the whole  piont.
This was the start the Blood Trilogy,and compared with them(2000  Maniacs and Color Me Blood Red)this is the weakest,but any DVD like this  with an audio commentary by H.G.Lewis is is worth checking out. There's also  a wierd and funny short subject about meat carving with Brian Kerwin(star  of Blood Feast)and a young Harvey Korman,who must have really needed the  work. He cant possibly be that excited about cuttig meat,but apparently he  don't turn down work. All this is facinating stuff for those already  interested,and those who will watch anything. You won't be dissapionted.",966643200,,1025,5.041666666666667
1247589,1,B00001ZWQN,"This is the first movie of director Herschell Gordon Lewis I have the opportunity to see. And I am disappointed. But it's clearly my fault. For years I've read the name of this director in horror movies dictionaries or  encyclopaedias and I've begun slowly to believe he was a forgotten unknown  genius.
So BLOOD FEAST is an exploitation movie destined for the 1963  american teenagers. Hence, the numerous close shots of the legs and the  bosoms of charming young women during the movie and the sadism of the  murder scenes. Apart from this sociological point of view, BLOOD FEAST, in  my opinion, doesn't deserve more attention.
Mal Arnold plays the  character of Fuad Rams&egrave;s, the psycho-killer ; you won't have any difficulty  to recognize him, he's the one with the dark blue hair. He is a vague  cousin of german director Fritz Lang's Dr Mabuse. In fact, if you watch  BLOOD FEAST without sound and in black & white, the film could possibly  be mistaken with a 1925 horror movie. Furthermore, there are only one or  two camera movements in BLOOD FEAST, the musical score (is it music, anyway  ?) is omnipresent and the actors and the dialogs are so ridiculously bad  that you surely won't feel guilty if you do so.
A DVD for the curious  ones.",958348800,,1255,4.692660550458716
1247590,3,B00001ZWQN,"How do you define the classic that is ""Blood Feast""? H. G. Lewis has said in interviews that as soon as the soft-core sex romps that he made went out of fashion, he needed a new angle that was cheap and attention  grabbing - well, it was GORE! ""Blood Feast"" was his first attempt  at this new style, and its hilarious from start to finish. The plot  involves a sinister shop owner who is trying to resurrect an Egyptian  goddess by dismembering beautiful girls. The film strings scenes of  bloodshed together with the most inept and hammy scenes ever committed to  film, especially those involing starlet Connie Mason, who can barely  remember her cues, and the assorted extras who really go overboard upon the  discovery of gruesome bodies. Watch out for the hysterical over-acting from  the grieving mother of the beach victim! The gore scenes are indeed  extreme, with gallons of blood and chunky bits splashed everywhere, but you  would be hard pushed to be frightened during these scenes as nobody really  looks like they are suffering. All in all it has the cheap atmosphere of  one of thos 60's ""nudie"" films, but instaed of lingering  close-ups on a young beauty undressing, you get lingering close-ups of a  young beauty having her tongue extracted, or having a leg sawn off while in  the bath! All in all it's enormous fun, especially at parties. Worth  buying.",957398400,,1371,4.76595744680851

1247592,5,B00001ZWQN,"""Blood Feast"" is the most famous work of exploitation auteur Herschell Gordon Lewis.  Released in 1963, it is considered the first slasher film, the one that spawned all of the imitators:  ""The Texas  Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Friday the 13th"", etc.  Despite (or  because of) its questionable acting and really fake blood, it is a classic.
Something Weird Video has given ""Blood Feast"" a great tribute  with its DVD version.  A beautiful print of the film was used, all of the  garish colors are presented in their full glory.  It contains one of the  most interesting audio commentaries on a DVD that I have ever listened to.  Director Herschell Gordon Lewis and producer David F. Friedman provide  insights into everything you've ever wanted to know about ""Blood  Feast"" - the casting, the special effects, the creation of Lewis'  signiature music score, and much more.  There are so many great anecdotes  shared on the commentary:  how Pine Sol was used to get rid of the smell of  the sheep tongue (used for the infamous tongue removal scene) since it was  being stored in a refrigerator and the power went out, how they had to  spend money on a freeze frame at the optical effects lab because an actress  pretending to be dead couldn't hold her breath (you can see her failed  attempts in the collection of nearly 50-minutes of outtakes included on the  DVD), a pizza parlor was used for the scene where the maniacal Fuad Ramses  cooks a human leg in an oven, and how they first realized the film was  going to be a phenomenon when they got stuck in a traffic jam on the way to  its Peoria, Illinois drive-in premiere.  P.S. - Bonus for trivia buffs:  Robert Sinise, the editor of ""Blood Feast"", is the father of  actor Gary Sinise.
The DVD of ""Blood Feast"" is a must own for  fans of the film and film buffs thanks to the great quality of the film to  DVD transfer and the extras included by Something Weird Video.",951955200,,1915,4.593471810089021
1247593,5,B00001ZWQN,"Just about every gorehound and exploitation film buff knows about this one because it's considered by many as the first gore movie ever made (it was actually FIEND WITHOUT A FACE which started it all but don't let that get  to you). Advertising salesman and english professer, Herschell Gordon Lewis  directed Playboy-playmate, Connie Stevens (despite her good looks she's a  REALLY bad actress) as a bimbo-ish history student who shows a lot of  intrest in Ancient Egyptian history. Connie's birthday is coming up soon  and her mum wants to suprise her with an Egyptian meal. She go's down to  the store and asks the sinister shop-owner (who trys his best to put on a  Bela Lugosi-type voice) what he can do. To prepare the feast the shop-owner  has to go around dismembering young girls. My favourite scene involves a  teenager crying his heart out after his girlfriend gets it from the  shop-owner: his crying is so fake that your pants will be dripping after  the film is over. This was a drive-in killer, by the way and usually played  in a double-bill with H.G. Lewis's 2000 MANIACS. Look out for some other  great H.G. Lewis titles such as SCUM OF THE EARTH, COLOR ME BLOOD RED, THE  GRUSOME TWOSOME, A TASTE OF BLOOD and THE GORE-GORE GIRLS which are all  avalible on Something Weird.",945043200,,1292,4.705357142857143

7915067,3,B00001ZWQN,"Blood Feast holds the distinction of being the first ever splatter movie  a film whose primary attraction is lots of gore and graphic imagery, highlighted by plenty of stage blood. It was the brainchild of Herschell Gordon Lewis, who was looking for a way to compete with Hollywood features. Without the studios stars or budgets, he decided to travel a path Hollywood was leary of back in the early 60s  graphic, grisly images in which the camera dwelled on human carnage.

Dorothy Fremont (Lyn Bolton) is looking to throw a party unlike any other, and she gets just that when she hires the sinister Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold) to cater the event. Promising to provide her guests with an authentic Egyptian feast, Ramses promptly sets about acquiring the necessary ingredients  the body parts of young women. Though the acting leaves much to be desired, director Lewis features several extremely graphic, over-the-top sequences including a scene involving the removal of a human tongue.

Lewis had made low-budget films featuring female nudity, a taboo that became less profitable when Hollywood began portraying increasingly frank depictions of sexuality. The next, untapped taboo was gore. Up until the release of Blood Feast, Hollywood treated horror and death gingerly, without dwelling on pain or suffering or showing up-close wounds. Lewis eschewed that approach for something quite different, going on to make a series blood-and-gore pictures, including Two Thousand Maniacs, A Taste of Blood, and The Gruesome Twosome.

Bonus materials on the 2-disc, unrated Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack include outtakes; Carving Magic, a vintage short film from 1959 featuring Blood Feast actor Bill Kerwin; archival interview with Herschell Gordon Lewis; archival interview in which Lewis discusses his entry into the film industry; Scum of the Earth, Herschell Gordon Lewis 1963 feature; trailers; feature-length commentary with director Herschell Gordon Lewis and producer David F. Friedman; and reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned artwork.",1508889600,,2046,5.458860759493671

7915069,4,B00001ZWQN,"Blood Feast is a 1963 film most known for being the first gore or splatter film. It was directed by Herschell Gordon Lewis who later became known as ""the Godfather of Gore"".

The plot of the film begins with a woman arriving home, turning on her radio and hearing a warning for women to stay indoors due to some grizzly murders in the area. Of course after turning off her radio a strange man enters her apartment and hacks her apart leaving with one of her limbs.

Shortly after the killer is seen at his place of business dealing with a customer who is looking to get her daughters wedding catered, The man, Fuad Ramses (Mal Arnold), convinces her to try an Egyptian feast.

It so happens Ramses is a follower of the goddess Ishtar, an Egyptian Goddess and the feast is actually to be in her honor.
The film itself is a cult classic known for its minuscule budget, somewhat comical acting and of course lots and lots of gruesome gore,

The film itself is one that is loved by many and possibly hated by more. It was a huge hit at drive-ins in 1963 where audience members were given 'Blood Feast' barf bags which were likely used, since some of the scenes were very shocking for that time period.  The film also featured Playboy Playmate Connie Mason, clearly for visuals.

The film was shot in Miami, FL on a budget of less than $25,000 and grossed over $4 million to date. 'Blood Feast' was quickly followed by '2000 Maniacs' to try to capitalize on the films success.

It has been said that there is a fine line between a good Herschell Gordon Lewis film and a bad one. Lewis has stated his personal favorite film of his is '2000 Maniacs', however this is the one that started it all for him and remains to this day his most well known and popular film.

If you are a horror fan, or more specifically a fan of splatter films then I definitely recommend giving this a watch.  If you go into it with an open mind and with no expectations, you just may join me and the many others who love 'Blood Feast' for what it is.",1491868800,,2020,4.336870026525199
