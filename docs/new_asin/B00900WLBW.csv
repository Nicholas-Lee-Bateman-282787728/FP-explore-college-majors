5198677,1,B00900WLBW,"Wow, what just happened here? I just watched the 2 hour debut and it was a throwaway. Boring storylines that went nowhere, ugly clothes, dull sets, overall just a complete mass of confusion.

First of all what year is it supposed to be now? And who is the new annoying new kid that came out of nowhwere that we are suddenly supposed to be interested in and that we had to look at for so long when we didn't even get to see more than a glimpse of Joan?

Aside from Joan, whom we get to see for all of two seconds, everyone looked terrible. The men all looked like they were made up to look like Barnabas Collins or as an extra for a remake of Night of the Living Dead. January Jone's makeup was even worse, so unrealistic I'm almost wondering if it was digital? She seemed to look like she was a different weight in each shot and the actual structure of her neck seemed to be changing from scene to scene.

Even the sets which have always been so fantasic were bad. Nothing about Hawaii looked even remotely mid-century and the only decent room to be seen during the entire premier was on the Carl's Jr. Commercial with Heidi Klum. This commerical, plus Christina Hendrick's Johnnie Walker spot, were the only things during the entire 2 hours I can recommend watching aside from Joan's photo op on the stairway.

At this point the only thing that can save Season 6 of Mad Men is for Pam to wake up and find Bobby alive in the shower. I just hope she finds him FAST before Mad Men gets cancelled!",1365292800,9,1494,4.287234042553192

5198687,4,B00900WLBW,"Once more Matt Weiner & Co take us back in time to the heyday of Madison Avenue advertising in the 1960's and the world of serial philanderer Don Draper (Jon Hamm).  As this series is coming close to it's conclusion things continue to evolve with all of the central characters.  Don is richer than ever living the high life in a Central Park high rise suite with his much younger actress wife Meagan (Jessica Pare).  Naturally Don's not satisfied, continues to have liasons with other women and his drinking is becoming problematic even by the booze soaked standards of the time.  He is slowly self-destructing and it's painful to watch.  The agency of Sterling, Cooper, Draper & Pryce in a surprising business move to woo Chevrolet merges with competitors Cutler, Gleeson, & Chaough (where Peggy (Elisabeth Moss) defected to at the conclusion of Season 5).  Pete Campbell (Vincent Kartheiser) is still a self absorbed jerk and is separated from his wife, moves into his little NY bachelor pad and deals with his mother's worsening dementia.  Joan (Christina Hendricks) despite being a partner still struggles for respect from her colleagues and co-workers.  Roger Sterling (John Slattery) copes with the death of his mother and being a single guy again and trying to maintain relevance in his own company.  Oh, and little Sally Draper's (Kiernan Shipka) is growing up fast challenging both of her parents.  She learns some unsavory truths about her father and now seems to loathe him as much as she does her mother Betty.

  If 1967 was the so-called ""Summer of Love"" than 1968 should be labeled the ""Year of Hate"" as this season repeatedly reminds us.  Though just a grade schooler back then I vividly remember the assasinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King as well as the Chicago riots during the Democratic National Convention; events which serve as a backdrop for season 6.  The special features include an interesting interview with the set designers and prop managers who must be applauded for their ability to take viewers back to this era so authentically.  In one scene Betty is sitting on a step stool in her kitchen while talking on the phone; we had the same stool in our kitchen and seeing something so mundane brought back many childhood memories.  The wardrobe department also deserves kudos for capturing the period so accurately reminding those of us who remember of some of the truly horrible clothes we wore back then.

  ""Mad Men"" isn't a cheerful or uplifting show but is an interesting study of a very specific time and place.  As a drama it can be a bit ""soapy"" sometimes but like a bad auto accident it's hard to turn away from watching this group of people as they live their lives during this turbulent period.  Probably not for everyone but first rate performances and solid writing make this series and engaging program to watch for history buffs and 'Baby Boomers'.",1501027200,,2906,4.851926977687627

5198714,4,B00900WLBW,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this show but the one thing that stood out during all the seasons is how black people were treated by whites, especially the way white females treated the black women. They would smile and pretend to respect them (like Betty, Don's first wife) and as soon as they did the least little thing, they would throw the black employee under the bus. Like firing a ""nanny"" who neglected her own family and children for years just to serve a lazy white woman too neurotic to raise her kids and clean her own house, only to be denied a reference so she could get another job.

And the other mistreatment, like the white employees having a party and tearing up the office and the black elevator operator and cleaning man, who weren't even present, getting fired. And the head of the agency not wanting a black person out front, and the total lack of acknowledgement of any sex appeal by the black females as if it were nonexistent (although I'm not complaining that there wasn't any interracial sex escapades).

At least this show was at least honest about how pervasive racism was then and how insensitive and insincere the whites who dealt with the blacks actually were.

Too bad this kind of honesty is totally absent in today's phony movies and TV shows where, if one was truly naive, would think racism had gone the way of the Volkswagen Beetle, but those of who live with it everyday know better",1467936000,,1428,4.54863813229572

They are included in the entire series box set (but inside the horribly designed disc book, it isn't indicated).  The commentaries are there, though.

If you want the S6 commentaries, don't bother with this. I'm not going to buy the box set for that.  I don't understand why they were recorded and not released before.

I can only imagine that this show depicted the advertising industry with its sexist twist during those times perfectly. Or at least what it must have been like if you were actually on the inside and living it. This show always made me reflect upon how much times have changed in regards to what was considered acceptable in an ad, yet all the while, the sexism and sexual harassment that went on in the workplace very openly would make most CEO's tremble nowadays. The two scenarios have definitely flip flopped from then till now. Nowadays, a commercial can come on while watching a cartoon depicting sex or sexual inuendos...yet if you tell a woman she looks beautiful in the workplace you better be prepared for a sexual harassment suit! Quite the opposite for the decade this show depicted! Lol",1454284800,,961,4.465909090909091

they owe us what appeared on all the other 5 series. The commentary is like the background of a novel while the story is playing out.",1438819200,,431,4.119047619047619

5198871,5,B00900WLBW,"I have watched all seasons of Mad Men at least twice. Mathew Wiener is a genius. I'm 57 years old and would have been Bobby's age back then. Don Draper is my father to a tee. My father owned an electrical wholesale distributing company in Los Angeles during this time and he had an office full of salesman on the phone. My father dressed like Draper and even sounded like him. The big difference is that Don is nicer to his kids then my father was to my sister and I. Him and my mother divorced and he had the new wife, the nice house in the San Fernando Valley and the parties on the weekends. My point is Mad Men is like looking back at my childhood.

Don doesn't change much and we just come to understand him more and watch how life takes its toll on him. His relationship with Megan, his kids and how he lives a life that is a lie. Don Draper epitomizes so many people in our society who think the answer to life is making money, having fun and repressing those things that bother us the most. The show is an excellent commentary on society even though it takes place in the 60's. I love this season although it took a bit to warm up to. I will certainly miss it when it's done.",1420156800,,1183,4.121212121212121

5198908,5,B00900WLBW,"Season 6 begins with a ""whimper""--a feeling of ""stretch"" footage for the sake of some period authenticity--first, it was the oppression of women in the workplace, and now of blacks (important, but it still feels like politically-correct ""equal time"").  The strength of ""Mad Men"" has been:

1. The writing simply rises above the competition. This is, believe it or not, a script without guns, pointless murders, relentless violence, terrorized women and children, explosives and explosions; and there is no continuous flashing of badges representing the FBI good guys who endlessly profile and eradicate all of the child molestors, rapists, serial killers and terrorists in our midst; there's not even the predictable forensics business--the clinical work on corpses (some of those ""dead"" actors can hold their breath forever!); and there are no set-ups in which we spend most of the hour watching other people watching screens--Really!  Just take note of the fixation on invasive computer screens and on software programs and computers that work without fail--usually in irrridescent color! (Talk about rubbing our face in our own screen habits and mocking our fixation on the screen and its simulation of reality!--""Mad Men"" is virtually the only popular dramatic series to spare us all of these gory and exploitive details, normally served up as dependably and predictably as ""Criminal Minds"" can grind out its next formulaic script or ""Law and Order: Miami"" can get a shot of David Caruso slipping into his shades.

2. The direction, or ""filming style,"" shows respect for actors and viewers that puts the trickery of other dramatic series to shame.  Have you noticed the ""classic"" cinematic style that distinguishes ""Mad Men"" from all of the series with spinning and traveling hand-held cameras and lenses that zoom in and out followed by jump-cut editing in the lab--all for the sake of the most ""contrived"" tension and energy.  By contrast, the steady camera and long takes of ""Mad Men"" (the actors are good enough not to require constant cutting after each short, micro-second take) would make an Alfred Hitchock or John Ford proud.  The shooting style of this series is ""cinematic"" and even ""theatrical.""  We can watch a shot of substantial duration because the camera gives us something worth looking at!  Again, the ""mis en scene"" or meaning or content of the shot is so powerful it doesn't require all of the juiced-up post-production special effects of most television dramatic series.  In short, the direction has integrity--and it gives the audience credit for possessing the same.

3.  The acting.  Could there possibly be a better James Bond (let alone Madison Avenue exec) than John Hamm?  In fact, what female character is smart and strong enough to serve as a compatible ""life-long"" companion for someone with the on-screen electricty and at times ""overwhelming"" presence of Don Draper?  I'm afraid Megan isn't it.  Peggy doesn't work either. Nor does Betty Draper. And, granted, she's the most glamorous and powerful female to hit any screen since Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell, but Christina Hendricks (Joan) would somehow seem like a step down, a disappointment to pair her with our modern-day restless and inventive Ulysses.  My guess is that this series will not end on the clich of ""marital bliss: found at last!""  Like writers after Homer who depicted Ulysses setting sail once again, too adventurous to settle down in Ithaca with his queen Penelope, Matt Weiner may finally show us Don Draper riding off into the sunset (or morning sun), perhaps with nothing left but his looks and his wit--which should be sufficient.  Even that sounds a bit corny, but somehow head writer Matt Weiner will make it work.

So warning: Season 6 starts slowly.  But the final episode left me (not to mention poor Sally Draper) with spine-tingling chills.  (I only wish I had the spine to confront my personal past and then expose my kids to it as Don Draper does--with unflinching, daring and deliberate honesty that makes him appear super strong and unspeakably vulnerable and weak at the same time.  ""This is who I am, kids. Will you accept me? Can you grow up, rejecting the bad part of me and embracing the good?""

We hear a lot about overly strict parents needing to listen to and forgive their children's misdeeds and poor judgment.  But that goes two ways.  There will come a point--perhaps toward the end of life--when every child will be asked, perhaps ""challenged"" is the better word, to accept a parent for what he is or has become.  Then it's the child's turn to forgive and to act with the strength, courage and patience that have been bequeathed the child by any loving parent.  As it is, the ""warehousing"" of so many of the elderly suggests that their ""careerist children"" may have absorbed the wrong values.  Parents, seniors, the elderly--many have much to offer, the wisdom of a lifetime to teach and pass on, yet few are called upon. (Lucky Tony Bennett.  Perhaps we all need a singing voice like his in order to be listened to.)

And the first half of Season 7 has ended with the biggest and best surprise yet.  But how can the series come up with a grand final capable of topping these two brilliantly conceived and acted endings?  I'm almost afraid to watch for fear that the show can't rise any higher.  The glass ceiling has been hit by all of the actors.  Is there anything left but the Requiem that closes Arthur Miller's ""Death of a Salesman?""  Which salesman will it be? Who will give the eulogy?",1412985600,,5533,4.924568965517241

5198972,2,B00900WLBW,"While I added it as a post script, there are no commentaries on any of the episodes on the season 6 blue ray.  I think it gives some insight into the fact that maybe the writers don't know where the story or characters are going so they have nothing to comment on.  Definitely the worst, well 1-5 were pretty good so comparatively the worst, season so far.  Too many story lines started in season 6 and too many abandoned from season 5.  It will be interesting to see how they tie it all up.  Season 1, Don seems to have it all, pretty wife, nice house in the suburbs, two kids, career on the rise, yet is unfulfilled. He chain smokes, drinks hard, cheats, and lies.  OK, we're hooked for four more seasons. Season 5 flounders.

The only woman, or person for that manner, to even really know Don and still like him was the original Mrs. Draper (wife of the real Don Draper).  She loves him so much that she is willing to let him leave her to go to New York to follow his dream.  He starts the series living the dream, as outlined in the previous paragraph, and season 6 tries unsuccessfully to bring him full circle.  Willing to give up the dream life just so people can see who he really is and how he is really feeling.  The writers may call it ""looking in the mirror"" or ""Don being honest with himself"" but it is poorly written and directed.  The final shot of the final episode should have been the first shot of the episode if they wanted us to feel any empathy.  Even his closest allies at the firm coldly send him away when he reveals that his true nature and upbringing is at odds with his profession.

I will also note that the writers have painted themselves in a corner by showing Don with the D.T.'s without a drink.  Even Roger tells him to get a drink before a client meeting because he obviously needs it to function.  There is no turning back now and social drinking is out of the question since they have seemed to have him cross the line between heavy social drinker and addict.  But then again to quote Peggy, ""He can't drink like you.  No one can.""  Part of Don's allure thus far has been his self destructive behavior of hard drinking, smoking and promiscuity.  With the end of season six, two out of the three seem to be out.

Instead of drawing it all out over several episodes of a seventh season I'm really in the mood to watch just one series finale.  I'm ready for the end.",1401667200,,2400,4.274944567627495

5198989,5,B00900WLBW,"Mad Men continues to be my favorite TV drama ever. Naysayers carp about the show complaining it doesn't accurately represent the era depicted but I find that accusation to be very annoying. Mad Men is a very stylized evocation of the advertising business in 1960s NYC. As such, it is meant to be escapism (as all filmed entertainment is -- including ""realistic"" dramas like The Wire) with numerous touchstones -- cultural, historical, political -- added to the mix to serve as storytelling anchors. The actors are superb and play their roles with savvy aplomb. There are other good dramas to view but Mad Men manages the feat of being better than all of them without blood, gore, and gimmicky tricks. One disapproving glance from Joan Holloway or Betty Draper, a witty riposte from Roger Sterling, or one condescending barb from Don Draper conveys more drama than any car chase, explosion, or bloody execution. Mad Men proves the best special effect of all is good writing, good editing, and good acting.",1398729600,,1004,4.911764705882353

5198993,3,B00900WLBW,"While I watched all 6seasons of MM, I found myself getting bored with many episodes.  I honestly think they drew out storylines just to continue making money.  I am sick of Don and his spoiled sense of ...if it feels good...  I liked Roger Sterling more than DD as at least he was fairly honest about what he is.  A lot of other good actors which kept me watching.  Sally is great...what a great actor she is...she steals every scene she is in especially with ( January Jones who, although beautiful, is th most wooden actor I can recall) and I would love to see what her character does as she matures among so many immature adults.

I was a teenager in the 60's and did have many memories of the time both good and bad.  It was a time of radical change and great loss. This country lost so many leaders and more than 50,000 in Viet Nam.  The scenes in California were done very well but brought home what we live with now.

I have watched the first episode of #7 and was underwhelmed.  I hate the split seasons...a ripoff if ever there was one.

5199007,4,B00900WLBW,"This is such an adult show for such an adolescent nation. This is evident when Don says to Megan, ""Let's go back to Disneyland,"" after the private turmoil of his life has exceeded his talent, charm, and capacity to navigate the ruins caused by his libido. Sustaining adolescence has been America's quick fix and fascination after WWII and has kept us distracted through the horrors of the 60's, which roll out before our eyes as Draper and Co. try to figure out how to seek more fantasy about ketchup and cars for Americans. Exhausting what was left of his reckless psyche, even though it is deep within his nature to present big hearted gestures, Draper will never get below the surface of his pain. No wonder he wants to go to Hollywood and run farther away from himself and his sins. Yet, the writers give him one more chance, one more flake of decency to redeem himself. It would be pure fantasy if he succeeds, for it is no longer his show. His daughter, Sally, probably the only adult in the Draper family--and that's because she has been at war with her family and is broken, but not broken enough to be seduced by a fumbling knot-headed boy--is now the character who fascinates because she would now be the age of most people watching this show. I wonder if broken Sally will be true to her childhood experience, her intellect and awareness and reject marriage, reject family, reject all the norms betrayed before her eyes, reject every myth of America and think Disneyland is just a place for kids.",1397260800,,1507,4.605947955390334

5199009,3,B00900WLBW,"The sixth season is slow, there is no way around that.  I have to assume many of the very slow scenes are done for dramatic effect, and sometimes the tactic is successful - others?  Not so much.

5199010,5,B00900WLBW,"OK I love Mad Men, started watching in season 4 on TV but before that Amazon was having a Christmas sale and each season was $9.99, so I bought 1-3 for myself and another season 1 for a friend and as it was awhile before season 4 was to begin I put it off to the side then my friend watched season and was hooked I mean FELL IN LOVE, and as I was working at the time I would binge watch on my days off and then I was hooked I'm talking about 3 seasons in a month and that's with a job as a restaurant manager. So season six you see a lot of changes from the first few seasons, women's rights, civil right's, a dash of homosexuality and that's just a taste, I don't like to give out details as I consider them to be spoilers and can ruin a show and this is too great of a show to do that to anyone who wants to start watching.

5199046,2,B00900WLBW,"Okay, the first FOUR DVD sets of Mad Men spoiled me. Usually there were two commentaries per episode that were fantastic. I could have even overlooked the other features. The price was just as high as the other seasons, but we got less.

On this set, there are only three bonus documentaries and there are four discs. The Target store version had an exclusive bonus disc with ""News from the 1960s."" I'm guessing that was going to be on disc four.

Do you DVD and Blu-ray folks want to drive us to Netflix? I like the bonus features and especially commentaries a lot and it often convinces me to buy DVDs and Blu-rays.

As they said on the Sesame Street spoof of this show, ""This makes us mad. Not glad, not sad. Mad!""",1394668800,3,717,4.37593984962406

5199049,5,B00900WLBW,I thought Madmen started out awfully slow and I didn't like it the first time I watch the first episode. Then after the first episode onto the second episode I thought series was absolutely wonderful. I love the fact that there were so many things from the 1960s in the set that it was absolutely amazing plus the costumes for the women and the men were absolutely great.

On a show where not much  happens in this dark and somewhat morose lifestyle of admen in NYC in the late 50's and 60's, I'm totally sucked in.  I had to buy this one episode because our cable was out...first world problems, yes, but we just had to watch to see if ""something"" or at the very least ""anything"" happened.

In truth, this is a very well written show on the whole.  The characters are deep and each actor personifies their character perfectly.  You have genuine feeling when Don does something he shouldn't, or they lose a campaign, or whatever the case may be.

Season six has no commentary tracks whatsoever, and the meager extras that are included are of much lower quality than those in previous sets.

5199088,5,B00900WLBW,"Mad Men was a show I started watching because it was on when I had time to watch and there wasn't anything I found more interesting.  Initially I found it slow, but interesting as it took me back to my youth and the lens through which the TV presented the world.  As the characters developed I became hooked and liked the show more as I started getting vested in the characters and impressed with the portrayal of the era's the show took the viewer through as it went from years of unprecedented economic stability and a society quite different from today and seeing the development of the characters and the period of change that forever changed our society.  The whole time as seen through an industry that is paid to portray life as being better because of things the sponsors sell.  An interesting perspective to begin with, but one used as the basis for the writing of the show.  Mad Men is a show that takes time to enjoy and really requires watching the entire series since the things happening in season 6 are powerful because of how they relate to the many things that proceeded them in prior episodes and seasons.  I purchased season 6 to watch through Amazon's Instant Video so as for the missing extra's from the DVD's I was unaffected.  As for the season itself I found it the best to date as the events continue to get larger since they occur in the context of a group of fully developed characters.  So I thought more happened in the Season than several of the earlier ones combined.  Such is the nature of a story with a lot of character depth.  It never seems to leave me lacking for surprise either as both my wife and I have actually yelled at the characters on screen for being so ____________!!!  I like that it inspires that sort of emotion as I normally only get that from a good book.  While it could be said the story is a soap opera the ties to history and the whole industry used as the backdrop and the impact it has on our society makes it far deeper and interesting.  5 years ago I would have thought Don would have crashed and burned by now and I wouldn't care, but I'm hooked and will watch and see how things turn out hoping that the destination is as good as the ride.",1391990400,,2202,4.354523227383863

5199101,2,B00900WLBW,"It's very hard to keep a great television series going beyond four or five seasons: even such brilliant shows as MARY TYLER MOORE and THE SOPRANOS had trouble keeping their quality at a consistent level. Alas, this is also true for MAD MEN, one of the most beautifully accomplished series of the last ten years. In this, its sixth season, nothing seems as new or as interesting anymore for the writers, as story tricks that seemed tremendously inventive in seasons past (hallucinatory drug use, the central ad agency re-branding itself and going through a major personnel shift, etc.) recur here in mostly tired ways, and Don Draper (the series' antihero) seems caught in a pattern of marital infidelities we've of course seen before quite a bit. All this would seem forgivable if so many characters weren't by this point so sour and unpleasant. Certainly the contempt that ad men have for their clients' limitations and timidities has been a major theme in the series, but Don and Peggy by this point (initially at different agencies) seem so consistently condescending and irritable that it's hard to root for their campaigns very much or care whether they can score new clients. There are some interesting ideas this season, but not many. Despite the wonderful work of newcomer to the show Linda Cardellini as Don's new neighbor and mistress, this has been by far the series' weakest season.

The DVD set of the sixth season is equally disappointing: there is not a single episode commentary, which makes buying the set mostly pointless because most episodes can be seen anyway on cable on-demand services anyway. Had I know this I would not have bought the set: getting to hear the actors' and especially the writers' ideas behind the series has been one of the most entertaining part of the DVD sets for this show previously.

5199120,4,B00900WLBW,"I like this show, as Ive seen every episode so far-including this whole season six.  I was not too disappointed this time around but Im wondering why the writing, pacing, and even the acting seems to be going downhill?  I know this series has only one more season left, but why let that spoil the whole thing?  One example being-The son of Dons married next door lover is about to be drafted in the Army.  Much is made of Don and his effort to get him out of it-but then nothing!  No follow up, no mention of what happened-I suppose we are just to assume that everything went ok?  There were several other plot lines that got a similar treatment but they were swept under the rug.  Perhaps its the beginning of the end?  In any case I hope the final season gets the attention to detail it deserves.  This show deserves that as does its fans.  As to the lack of commentary I could care less.  I do think if the other seasons had it, the purchaser should have been been warned up front before purchase.",1390521600,,1000,4.294117647058823

There is no more dedicated fan than myself. I watch episodes multiple times and listen to all the fan podcasts.

A great feature for the DVDs from seasons 1-5 are the multiple commentary audio tracks. Usually there is a commentary track with Matthew Weiner and another producer or writer discussing the episode. Additionally there is a commentary with a couple of actors. These commentaries are the main reason I own the DVDs.",1390176000,5,638,4.898148148148148

Don, the lead, is very handsome and seductive but they never really get into his head about why he needs to bed everywoman he encounters.  They hint and show a lot of his childhood but it doesn't seem to mean anything as far as what's going on in the present. The acting is great.  Again by Season 5 they're going to a Rolling Stones concert (although they only hang out in the hallway) and there's just not that much left to do with the characters.",1389312000,,586,4.196428571428571

I'm not sure it would be as good for someone who didn't live during that era, but the acting and characters are great even without the backdrop of the 60's.

Don Draper continues to find inner peace and for the first time his inner struggles affect his work.  The untouchable advertising genious he is, begins to show some weakness.  Peggy continues to struggle with being a woman in the workplace and having a normal life outside of it.  Pete Campbell seems to just be the guy with the worst luck, while Betty seems to be getting a better balance on life without and with Don.  Sally becomes more of a character on her own instead of just Don's daughter, which is a good thing.  Overall, season six of Mad Men is a must for any fan of the show.

Introducing new characters without any introductions is the most jarring and made me go back and look at the episode list to make sure I didn't miss one.

With all that said the show is so good and that while I was watching  the season I hardly thought it was of lessor quality and by the 3rd act of the season it's going full steam ahead.

yes the show requires a bit more sense of disbelief on the viewers part than previous seasons but stick with it and let it take you along for the ride.

Some plot twists are ridiculous (like how Peggy's relationship ends), others happen so fast they're just not believable. The ending is one big long back and forth. Neither convincing nor satisfying.

This is very disappointing, especially during this dark season, there is not a single commentary on ANY episode.

I already watched the show, I buy these DVDs because normally the extras are amazing and I love the commentaries.  Maybe we've been spoiled, but after 5 seasons of amazing extras, they're expected and the complete lack of commentaries is, in the slang of the sixties, ""a real bummer, man.""

However, like others, I am appalled that Lionsgate would do this to the fans after its history of giving us at least one commentary per episode, often more. What on earth is the point of purchasing the DVD if we're going to get no added value? There's no point pretending that extras like the ability to view the apartments and offices could ever make up for not hearing input of the actresses (what did Kiernan think of the episode I watched?), actors (what are James Wolk's insights into Bob Benson?), directors, and tech folks (Janie Bryant, where are you?). Even if the company were to emulate other major shows that offer less commentary, they could have done as was done with most seasons of ""West Wing"" and offered commentary at least on the pivotal episodes such as ""The Doorway,"" ""Favors"" and ""In Care Of.""

5199262,5,B00900WLBW,"My favorite season of Mad Men so far. As many have noted, season six takes time to build, but even the first few episodes are beautiful the first time (Roger's door speech, oh man...) and more haunting as you gain knowledge of what's to come. This is an incredible season of television. People wonder what the appeal is of Mad Men. The appeal has been there all along, and I think that it's probably similar to one's take on ""art films."" If one considers them boring--which is not a permanent take, though it can sometimes last for ages--then it might seem that Mad Men (and especially this season) is slow and uneventful. But if one can sink into them like paintings, then more or less every minute of Mad Men (and especially this season) will be haunting and beautiful. We return to those two adjectives. There are many more, but adjectives tend to obscure direct experience, so my advice is: If you love watching Mad Men thoroughly (love the experience of watching, which can be different than tuning in for other reasons), then there's so much to love here in season six.",1385164800,2,1075,4.604166666666667

This season, like its predecessors, started a bit slowly then drew me in and intrigued me.  Each season of Mad Men is made of 13 episodes, and the show has done an excellent job of building tension then ending with a wallop. However, Season 6 just fell flat after about nine episodes. I truly wanted to love this one, and I did enjoy several of these episodes. Mad Men the series is still one of the greatest shows on television, and its greatness has given me high expectations.

Well, just finished re-watching the season. Still angry at the lack of commentary, but now I am even more angry at the poor quality of the special features that do exist. I watched the featurette on the set design and the audio is terrible. They must have used one mic in a tin can of a room.

But for some reason, on the season 6 discs, they've left the commentaries off.  So if you're choosing discs over streaming options in order to get the commentaries, know that they aren't here this time.

I'm pretty disappointed to be missing the Cliff's notes experience I've dug so much on previous seasons.  But this season was so good I'm still giving it 5 stars.

5199277,5,B00900WLBW,"""Mad Men Season Six""
(HBO, 2013)
. . .

NOTE: mild spoilers below. don't freak out.
. . .

The year is now 1968, and as with previous seasons, viewers will have to play a little catch-up to get settled into this season. The new ad agency is booming, and business is almost too good. Meanwhile, the Vietnam War has heated past the boiling point, the counterculture has hit the mainstream, and everyone is turning on, if not actually dropping out, while ""women's lib""-style feminism is still bubbling up, just barely off the radar. Meanwhile, Don Draper seems to be still stuck in the hard-drinking swinger mentality of the previous decade: will he be able to make the scene in the psychedelic Sixties? The answer may surprise you.

Several episodes are historical set pieces: the assassinations of Martin Luther King, Jr. and Bobby Kennedy loom as large on the show as they did in real life (although if I'm being totally honest, these episodes seems a bit forced: their earlier evocations of JFK's assassination and the Cuban Missile Crisis had a richer, more convincing texture...)

Perhaps the most evocative historical references here are the fab, eye-popping fashion, with bold, brightly colored pop-art prints and dynamic cuts typical of the late '60s -- not the shabby tie-dye stereotypes that became Hollywood's ""Sixties"" shorthand in the '80s and '90s. The ""Mad Men"" costume department really went to town on this season and, even though I'm hardly a fashion follower myself, I found a lot of the women's fashion that came up in this season to be consistently fresh and exciting. The visual look of this season's clothing was truly stunning: take that, ""Project Runway""!!

The narrative arc has its ups and downs, a couple of plot points I didn't totally buy, but overall it's another strong season with slow, deliberate pacing, admirable period detail, complex and often troubling character growth, and a cliffhanger ending that sets Season Seven up to be another doozy. What's next? A man on the Moon?? (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1384560000,3,2051,4.950581395348837
5199278,3,B00900WLBW,"Not my favorite season. Not enough excitement about the ad industry. Too much about Don, ad nauseum. I was very disappointed that they didn't do it with commentaries. At least then I would know why it was done the way it was done.",1384560000,4,230,4.372093023255814
5199279,5,B00900WLBW,"My wife loves this show and it was a purchase for her. In my mind, it's a glorified soap opera but I will say they gave incredible attention to period detail in the sets, dialogue and dress.
Again, the wife loves it but for my part I'd rather dress myself as a baby harp seal, lay on the ice, and wait for a hunter to come club me than watch it.",1384560000,,345,3.8732394366197185

I have bought the episodes on iTunes, but was looking forward to commentaries as we have gotten on previous seasons of Mad Men.  Amazon even mentioned ""commentaries"" in its special features for this set when I pre-ordered it. I enjoyed this season and was looking forward to hearing form cast and crew about what it was like tackling the late 60s, but now I feel a little cheated.",1383955200,15,458,4.6419753086419755

I wish that they would put out a version with a commentary or at least NOT leave it off the 2 halves of Season 7. Will these be 2 DVD's or one?",1383955200,14,452,4.089887640449438

5199296,2,B00900WLBW,"I've been a fan of Mad Men ever since it premiered on AMC, but I found S-6 to be below par.

I was looking forward to the DVD release, with audio commentary, in the hope that it might add to the experience of the season for me, and would at least offer some insights as to why the season played out as it did. Since the S-6 DVD set offers no audio commentary, Im doubly disappointed.

So far, there have been no press reports about why the DVD of S-6 did not have any audio commentaries. Was it deliberate or just merely an oversight or error in production? Either way, it really diminishes the overall value of the DVD.

Im really questioning whether its actually worth my time to watch, then buy, the upcoming S-7a and S-7b. Id like to think that the series might redeem itself and regain some of its previous glory, but if this lack of audio commentary on S-6 is any indication of the shape of things to come, my expectations are frankly, quite low on all counts.",1383868800,14,966,4.2967032967032965

I love hearing Matthew Weiner and company on every single episode but now all of the sudden they went from having them on every episode to none at all.  This is an absolute disgrace and a cheap rip off of the fans I recommend viewing it on Netflix or using your DVR'd episodes don't waste your money on this horrible release.  I wouldn't have been as upset if they just cut a few maybe even half the episodes but to go from multiple commentaries on every episode to not 1 single commentary it's ridiculous.,1383782400,20,645,4.31404958677686

I'm watching the first episode now, and it has no commentary. I miss the old DVD packaging with artwork, great presentation, and plenty of extras. Blu-rays use minimal packaging (eco-friendly supposedly, but cheaper to produce) in flimsy plastic. At least it came with a slip-cover.",1383782400,3,455,4.846153846153846

This is the best part of the DVD set for any serious fan of the show. So the one star is strictly for this and this alone. It does not reflect the show itself - the show is fantastic!

5199306,1,B00900WLBW,"Beware: no commentaries on the Blu-ray.  Most of the reason I bought the discs was to hear Matthew Wiener and the cast provide commentary. Unlike other shows, Mad Men is known for giving commentaries on EVERY episode of every season. That this wasn't communicated in the description for the product was also misleading.

I would recommend not buying and waiting to see if they provide a disc set with commentary later on.  Perhaps if Lionsgate or AMC loses enough money on the discs they will get the message that this wasn't a cost effective move!  I'm giving one star not because I hate Mad Men (it was a superb season) but to send a message: lack of commentary and, especially, lack of notice there is no commentary is unacceptable. I already have the episodes saved on my DVR. I could have saved $35.99 and now, because I preordered in August, I cannot return my purchase. Boo!",1383609600,98,881,4.628205128205129

5199322,5,B00900WLBW,"This show is a true and clear representation of the era both in terms of the times and the trials in life that the characters face. I love this show because I grew up during the 50s & 60s, so this really brings back vivid memories of the hardships of that both sexes faced about certain things in life. There were so many things that were still thought of as taboo that we take for granted today, Matthew Weiner is brilliant!",1382572800,,425,4.2592592592592595

5199326,5,B00900WLBW,"We series-binged on Mad Men seasons 1-6 and enjoyed it immensely. In fact we've come back around and started over in season 1. But, as far as season 6 goes, it was everything you'd expect from this excellent series. (Here come spoilers) The theme of the season, I think, is falling from grace. Don Draper falls the hardest and furthest, eventually being suspended from the firm for tanking a presentation to Hershey Chocolate executives by giving them a no-holds-barred description of his childhood. By that point in the last episode, Meagan has already left him, he has become a full-fledged problem drinker, and he is alienated from his daughter, who caught him in an extremely compromising position with another woman. At the same time, Trudy finally gets to the end of her rope with Pete Campbell, and throws him out. The backdrop for all of this is 1968, a tumultuous year in history that saw the assassination of MLK and Robert Kennedy, so the United States is also falling from grace in a manner of speaking. As usual, the writers skillfully blend true life with fiction. As the season ends, there are hints that the fortunes of the characters have bottomed out - Sterling Cooper & Partners is starting a West Coast office and it seems like that resulted in an overall feeling of optimism as the season ended. The last scene with Don and his children also leads one to think he will redeem himself in season 7.

On a side note, this was the first series I've ever streamed from Amazon (using a Roku device) and I was very happy with it. The episodes now reside in the Cloud on my playlist to be watched again.",1382140800,2,1616,4.611111111111111

for me, the hook is wanting to find out what happens to  Don Draper.  He is a complicated character, loves his children, cheats on his wife but is very protective of her privacy(selfishly) Also I am enjoying the competition that has shown up between the ad agencies. This adds a new layer to the several underlying dramas.",1380412800,,592,4.663461538461538

5199349,3,B00900WLBW,I started to follow Mad Men series for the in depth development of the characters true to the time in which they lived.  Season 6 is just one steamy(someone thinks apparently)scene after another.  The characters do little but repeat themselves and are but 2 dimensional compared to when the show first aired.  The writers appear to be getting lazy.,1379980800,,348,4.864406779661017

I also long for the pre politically correct days that the show displays so well with its period dress and settings. I say unintentionally great because to me the show in many ways shows how our society had deteriorated while I think the shows creators intended to show how we have progressed.  And before any Libs get their panties in a knot, I of course don't mean times have not gotten better in some ways, like in black and some female civil rights for instance.

The SD feed is grainy and dark and in this instance, the stream stalled no less than 6 times.

This season is no different and in my opinion was even better than last season.  I've really enjoyed this character driven story and Mad Men doesn't appear to suffer quite as much as other shows in continuing seasons due to the persistence of characters not dwindling away due to over use of coincidence or revolving love interests.

How will 'Mad Men' deal with the events that I lived through? And is the title sequence to the series foreshadow the inevitable end? Draper exits through the window? (Does anyone else recall the throwaway line in some past season -- Draper saying words to the effect that ""there's another way out of this office""? Which suggests, to me, the window? Will he pull it out, literally and figuratively? Dunno about you, but I'm bracing for a train wreck in the final season. Does anyone out there have hope?

5199393,3,B00900WLBW,"My husband and I began watching Mad Men on Netflix this summer. I LOVE this show. They have managed to keep it fresh for five solid seasons.

Season Six, however, was tough and not all that enjoyable to watch. Why? Donald Draper was so unlikable that I don't care about him anymore... well, I care a little.

Matthew Weiner has promised that he won't disappoint the viewers with the ending of the series next season. For me not to be disappointed, Draper will only have time for AA meetings and therapy sessions....  And he would have to be alone for the first time in his life, unless he was taking Sally to a Father Daughter dance at her school.  Episodes 1-12 would contain 33 minutes of apologies each and Don would be demoted to Peggy's secretary.

Then maybe, just maybe, by the series' finale, I might have a tiny bit of faith that Donald Draper/Dick Whitman could actually be redeemed and therefore happy.

is so cleverly portrayed. Many women's voices and opinions are shared throughout this
male dominated era and business. Love the characters (even the one's who are mean and
evil) and crazy for Don Draper's character. He is so complex and diverse. Love to see the layers
revealed slowly (like a striptease) and he is not hard on the eyes. I hope and pray there is a
season 7 because I am hooked on MAD MEN.",1377561600,,501,4.28421052631579

Season 6 consistently continues the character development from the first 5 seasons for all of the characters, young and old alike. As a human interest story, the internal struggle of Don Draper and the increasing re-emerging of his authentic self, Dick Whitman, dominates season 6. In addition to being a great story, Mad Men Season 6 provides a great historical context of the late 1960s. And seeing the clothes and hairdos of men and women in office and social settings is visually very appealing and is one of the great things about Mad Men Season 6.",1377561600,,670,4.7844827586206895

Hamm is great like his other stuff- funny-- like partner Westfeldt's Friends With Kids, in which he also appears, along with Kristen Wiig, Maya Rudolph, and other Bridesmaid cast mates Adam Scott (who co stars with Westfeldt in Friends W Kids and is also from Party Down, Parks and Rec), and Chris O'Dowd (the policeman/ Wiig's love interest in Bridesmaids).",1376006400,,527,4.802197802197802

And I have a vivid recollection of Don lecturing Pete Campbell on the subject of infidelity.  Apparently Mr. Draper now needs the same lecture!

I love the period atmosphere and the way every detail, down to the phones and typewriters, sounds just right for the late sixties.
My problem is that I am losing empathy for Don's character.  He is cheating on a better man than he is, and this just doesn't work for me.",1375142400,,626,4.495575221238938

5199478,5,B00900WLBW,"As usual, the only thing remotely resembling merriment on this show is the great charachter of Roger Sterling, as played by John Slattery. Everyone, as usual, is mostly depressed, angry, bitter, remorseful, or a combo of any two to four. But isn't that always Mad Men? Like most, I'm compelled to stick around for more anyway, since it's one of the best scripted and literate shows in recent history. The show continues to surprise with the way the charachters grow and their situations change. Stoner bonus: Weed becomes as common as the liquor as the show barrels through the late sixties.",1374883200,,591,4.861386138613861

I just wish he would articulate better at times so you can hear his fantastic lines!  The more Don tries to control his life (and the people in it), the more it spirals out of control.  Elisabeth Moss earned another Emmy nom as Peggy, who plays a bigger part than you might have expected this season.  She has such poor choice in men, though, and seems to only succeed in her career.  The season finale was all that I hoped for, and I can't wait for season 7.",1374883200,,629,4.235294117647059

It felt like the actors were just walking on and off of the set.  Continuity seemed weak.  I found myself saying ""WHAT?"" several times.  I prefer a season that continues with the same great threads from the last successful seasons, and deepens them, rather than trying to create meaningless drama.",1374883200,,424,4.847222222222222

Acting - Gets deeper and more dimensional with each season
Art direction and costume/hair/make-up is absolutely perfect to the times.

1968 was a manic, tragic, violent, exciting year and those changes are echoed and reflected in the lives of all at the new Sterling Cooper and Partners. The work done by John Slattery, Elisabeth Moss & Jon Hamm was especially potent this season.

There is so much to take in, I like to watch each episode twice. Like a great painting, the second viewing always uncovers something in character or conflict that you may have missed the first time.",1374364800,,597,4.8431372549019605

If you've made it this far in Mad Men you're watching this anyway, right?",1374019200,,372,4.253521126760563

5199516,5,B00900WLBW,I'm a huge fan of Mad Men. Season 6 delivers as expected. Don is becoming a bigger stinker this season.

More novelistic than previous seasons, with deep literary and psychoanalytical allusions, this season challenges viewers more than any other to understand both character and culture and the complicated ways in which they interact. Marx, Freud, Jung, Dante, McMurtry, and Polanski are never far behind the curtain. Some will complain that it's Mad Men's slowest season yet; but for the patient, every episode is a novella, waiting for you to pull the curtains back and understand deeper and deeper layers of meaning.",1373328000,,645,5.152380952380953

Season 6 was just OK, I can't say much more than that. Too much Peggy, not enough Roger. There were a couple of story arcs that never paid off (I know, they don't necessarily have to).

The writing, acting talent and costume design never cease to amaze.  A credit to the talent, I rarely have a favorite character but simply drawn to each character's story.  Every story as important as the rest.  As they are rolling up to 1970 in the script, it is sad to know that it will coming to an end soon.",1373155200,,479,4.288888888888889

There was a lot of focus on the development of Don's character, but this took away from other characters and the agency took a back seat and was barely part of the plot. If I had to rate these first episodes, it would be pretty close to 1 star.

Luckily things got much better in the second part. Things started happening and we got a lot more into stories involving other characters, the agency, etc. If this had not been the case I would have been hesitant as to whether to keep watching this series or not. Hopefully next season will continue on the high note in which it ended!",1372982400,3,759,4.270833333333333

5199580,5,B00900WLBW,"All the disjointed, difficult heartache of MM Season 6 made for a wonderful allegory for the late 1960s.  The art in it was to use the turmoil of the '60s, but bring it down into the characters' stories rather than just using the events of the time to create false situations. While we saw and heard what was going on, we lived our lives. The events helped shape our environment, but did not create our stories. This season of MM showed that.",1372982400,,442,4.390243902439025

Maybe the theme is ennui in his life, but ennui makes for a whole lot of ho-hum. I am waiting for depth of plot and some serious character development -- these kicked in for me, finally, about episode four. I am now at episode five feeling more like this is the series I know. I wonder if the script writers have changed? Don't have that feeling of incredible yet subtle story-weaving finesse.

5199588,5,B00900WLBW,"This series is dark and disturbing, often dealing with people whose choices are immoral or amoral. We see fallout from these choices in human suffering as hypocrisy is exposed, but the people somehow go on, as many of us have after making mistakes in life. The attention to detail is surprisingly good, recapturing the appearance and feeling of each year as the series progresses. The acting is superb, and I, as a viewer, have come to care deeply about these very flawed characters, though some drive me a little nuts.

5199595,4,B00900WLBW,"This season of Mad Men portended to be filled with all sorts of dramatic action. It was and it wasn't. I'm going to draw a parallel with The Sopranos, especially because we're dealing with the same creators. And why mess up a formula that we already know has legs and works. The parallels in character development between the two shows is evident. In The Sopranos, Tony had a gun that did a lot of his work for him. In Mad Men, Don has a 'gun' that does his work for him. Yes, in The Sopranos, there weren't as many childhood flashbacks, but the end result was the same. A person who was frequently unfeeling of the consequences of his actions. There is one part of the show that I find somewhat disingenuous; For the most part the show is very faithful to the era of the 60s. Once in a while there's a discontinuity error, but nothing major. But somehow, I feel like, again every once in a while, that Don is going to reach off the set and come back with his iPhone in his hand. If I could exactly spell out why I feel that way, I certainly would, but there is something in the acting, sets, set decoration I don't know what, that makes me feel like it's really set in 2013. Not very many detriments to a very complex show. My guess is that next season (the last season) as we move to the denouement of the series, we'll see something very much like the end of The Sopranos. That wouldn't be all bad either.",1372982400,,1408,4.237918215613383

Last season was so amazing, I almost died with anticipation of thinking what happens next. But this season, there was only three episodes (including the finale) that interest me, the rest was so boring. Basically the characters (like Betty, Don, etc.) went down a road (a plot) that went nowhere and then they went on to the next episode. I wish I saw more Joan, despite me not liking how Bob is another copy of Don-I like that he knows how to push Pete's buttons. Peggy? Almost at the end I started not to like her which is strange to me. Now all of sudden she's acting like a kid who didn't get dessert when it comes to falling in love with a married man (didn't she learn her lesson with Pete?!).

The characters develop well, although not all in ways that are predictable.  I am still undecided on the portrayal of late-1960s egalitarianism, especially as they portray how individuals are dealing with the feminist/women's movement.

This show has finally fleshed out for me how we got from the conformist '50s to the narcissistic '70s, a complete and total swing of the pendulum.  It recreates the historical mood and changes in style, language, outlook, social mores, beautifully ...

5199662,4,B00900WLBW,"Mad Men Season 6 is disappointing, and I don't think I am the only fan to think this way. The season starts really strong,with great storyline and development. I loved the episode when they all take medical grade speed and go off the deep end. I love the social commentary, and the focus on the existential crises of Don and Peter, and even Ted, to a lesser extent. One of my biggest critiques of this season is what happens to Peggy, who seems to lose all of her feminist power and be reduced to a whiny girl whose boyfriend dumps her (for no discernible reason except that the writers wanted her to have an affair with Ted) and who becomes involved with a married man. Joan's story, too, seems to fall off the map, Don goes on bender after bender for no real reason. It almost seems like the story was mapped out through the middle, and then after that, the writers just went for melodrama and mess. Why on Earth does Abe get stabbed and then dump Peggy in the ambulance? Why do Don and Betty sleep together at camp? Why does Megan get kissed by her coworker? The list goes on and on. Sally's character becomes sullen and angry but not further developed in this season. I kept hoping, as I watched, that there was some purpose to the melodrama and bad storylines; that there would be a twist somewhere and all would be revealed in some masterful plot development, but it seems as if the writers lost their way this season. Here's hoping that the next one is better: otherwise, the Mad Men that we knew and loved seems to be gone.",1372204800,3,1531,4.375438596491228

The one thing I will say is that the character of Don Draper angered me more than ever before during this season...but I think he was supposed to, because his character hits rock bottom (at least, I hope it's his rock bottom).

5199672,5,B00900WLBW,"To all the people giving the show a one-star review because of either some mishap caused by Amazon or their failure to realize the pitfalls of relying on online streaming: send Amazon a letter of complaint. You're dragging down user's ratings for a television show that has nothing to do with your trials and tribulations. There are starving people in Africa who can't watch Mad Men.

Would those starving Africans enjoy watching Mad Men? You bet your bottom Dollar. This season has been littered with griping from a noticeably large amount of viewers. ""Don is a jerk!"" they say. ""I can't stand looking at Megan's teeth!"" shout others. Throughout all of this, I have kept a level head. For the five previous seasons, Matt Weiner and Co. have given me the greatest television show of our time and as result I have given them my complete faith in whatever direction they take the show. In the end, it payed off.

Last night's season finale showed Don recognizing all of the errors that Mad Men's viewers have noticed for quite some time. He's acting on his alcohol addiction. He's finally aware that running away can't solve your problems. Most importantly, he's realized that his children are the most important things in his life.

Don has always been an anti-hero and this season saw him sinking to new lows. The writers made a huge risk in basing the show around a character which many couldn't sympathise for, but hopefully most viewers agree that last night's episode ended with a powerful, sobering, and hopeful note. I couldn't be more happy with season 6 and I'll spend the next eight months looking very much forward to Mad Men's, Don Draper's, and every other character's final denouement.",1372032000,8,1698,4.808219178082192

5199675,3,B00900WLBW,"While overall I liked Season 6 much more than Season 5, much of it was starting to become predictable.  What I liked was the acting and the addition of most of the new characters.  I also liked that the show broadened out and wasn't so focused on the relationship of Don and Megan.  It was great to have Betty back and also good to see Don and Betty reunite somewhat.

Once again, as in Season 4, Don begins to spiral out of control but by the end of the season he has allowed himself to go into freefall.  Peggy and Joan have come into their own and are emotionally the two strongest characters on the show.  Roger is still Roger, but seems to have taken a back seat this season to other characters, which was a shame.

I still wanted to throw something at the screen every time I heard Megan sigh and watched her emote.  I don't think I have seen acting that bad since the 60's.  One of the high points of Season 6 was that she was in it a lot less than Season 5.  I realize not many share my point of view on this actress or character, but she was the main reason I did not purchase Season 5.

Most of the episodes in Season 6 were interesting and ones that you would want to watch again, but as with season 5, there seemed to be a lot of dropped story lines.  At the end of season 5, Megan's friend looks at Don as says ""are you alone?""....Don looks up, the season ends and we never know if he got together with the friend she wanted to introduce him to or not. Also, no retribution for Megan stabbing her friend in the back regarding the shoe commercial, in fact we never saw or heard from any of her acting friends again.  Season 6 led up to a confrontation between Don and Arnie over Sylvia, but again that never happened.  The same with the Avon account that Joan was bringing to the firm.  She cut Pete out, there was tension and then the fake phone call, and nothing more ever mentioned about this account again.

I really didn't like the last episode though and without putting in a spoiler, none of it rang true, especially regarding the actions and consequences of Don and Peggy, and Joan sitting in judgment of Don at the partner's meeting.  Not any part of this was believable.  I also think it would have been more interesting had the last episode been a two part episode, rather than the first episode.

I still love this show and look forward to Season 7, the last season.  Wonderful as it has been, it's probably time for it all to end because it is becoming a little long in the tooth.  You can feel the writers straining for ideas.  One thing is for sure though, Don Draper, I will never forget you.",1372032000,,2620,4.229376257545272

While I may not have a TV or cable or all of that jazz, I have my Amazon, my precious Amazon, and I have signed up for digital delivery of every Mad Men Season 6 episode because this means I can stay current with my favorite show and with the culture surrounding my favorite show. I log in, my child is still asleep, I've made it. I am up early enough to watch the show!

There's. No. Show.

What gives, Amazon? Why did you ruin my morning plans? Because of this I cannot and will not go online, go on Facebook, check my email, - because I do not want to know how the Season ended, I do not want reviews or spoilers, because I thought I had been on track and following the plan to avoid all of this by subscribing to Amazon Season Pass digital delivery. But oh, sadly, wow, was I wrong.

I hope at the very least my lovely $2.00 can be returned to me for making me suffer through this very crabby first world problem of not being able to see the most important episode of a very amazing show on a service that I have subscribed to promising to make it available to me after it airs/the next morning.  I am going to think twice about future ""Season Pass"" subscriptions and may, unless things improve over here, do what others have said to do and just get things like this via iTunes, where delays like this are rare if ever, and I don't have to feel like such a fool!

I usually even watch each episode twice in a row to make sure I missed nothing and that I understood all of the underlying little innuendos either said or those even unsaid.  This show is so incredibly well written, that it will be a very sad day when they decide to kill the reprise of the 60's to those of us who were children of that time and day.

The series quite cleverly starts out slow and a bit sluggish in enticement, but towards the end of the season it starts to move toward a major ending and gets all that more engrossing and appealing.  Great casting, well scripted and well acted during a tumultuous time period in our country and you have a recipe for success.

5199754,5,B00900WLBW,"I have always liked and admired the quality of Mad Men. Some episodes really shine, others are good.

This one? F***ing Brilliant, and here's why.

This is, without a doubt, the most subtle, most intelligent, best written, best depiction of the psychological violence that can be done to a child by a parent to date. It is the best depiction I have yet seen on any TV series of the uniqueness of the father / daughter relationship and how it can so easily be twisted into something insidiously incestuous.

Don Draper, after having committed this act not only upon another man's wife but his own daughter, composes a look upon his face that shows us he is perfectly aware of what he's done to his daughter yet belies his own completely unaware state (Jack Hamm should get every award in existence for this moment alone).

If the rest of the seasons had been lackluster, it would have been worth it to follow it for this episode alone. Each of the characters, in their turn, are shown as sleepwalking through their own unselfaware states. Absolutely brilliant.

anyone, but I mean anyone, who aspires to throw away this show as simply more surface, slick showbiz glam with a few important things to say, is very much mistaken.

Every Mad Men season has its stranger episodes that don't always make sense at the time.  There are instances when you feel like you need advanced degrees in various subjects to really get what's going on.  But, when viewed in context of the entire series and what was happening in society at large at that time, these episodes impress me with their richness and yes, they do make perfect sense!  1968 was a strange, terrifying and fascinating year...this season of Mad Men reflects that year perfectly.",1371081600,,592,4.7745098039215685

The complexity of these men's (some of the women's, too) lives that grows as a result of deceit and manipulation becomes less and less appealing over time.  The show does an excellent job of character portrayal and accurate depiction of life in the 50's; it also does a good job of cultivating the feeling of a relationship of sorts with the main characters.

5199773,5,B00900WLBW,"I've seen lots of negative reviews of this season. Yes, if you're not watching close enough this season may seem boring or trivial or as one person said ""a mess"". It certainly started out as a crawl rather than with a bang and the introduction of plenty of new characters which can add to the confusion. However this episode and the previous one renewed my faith. This season just isn't about big drama or what happens in the office. It is about the character's personal lives, particularly Don's. In this season we are finding out the cool, confident, casanova is plagued by his childhood experiences. We get to witness the more quiet dramatic moments like Megan's miscarriage or the moment in this episode in Pete's office. At times it is difficult to watch because of the topics being addressed but not because of the acting or script.

I only hope this is supposed to be the classic dark second act as opposed to a downturn for the show in general. Don Drapper seems to some degree to be falling apart and the first episode of this season seemed to almost foreshadow his demise.",1370908800,,1082,4.606217616580311

5199775,1,B00900WLBW,"I suppose there's a good reason why shows don't stay tight and credible for more than 4 seasons. In Mad Men's case the seasons are cut in half, but still those years go by and people change, get tired, get bored and lose interest. That's how I'd describe everyone involved in this show, from the writers to the actors to the producers. They're all basically punching the clock and counting the minutes until it's time to go home.

This season is replete with rehashed plot elements, insipid dialogue, aimless and meandering storylines and  wildly improbable plot devices like merging the two rival agencies so that Peggy and Don can once again be in the same office. It's a chaotic mess and virtually unwatchable. They ought to put this whole thing out of its misery and not launch season 7. I imagine it'll be even worse than this one.

The creators think they can refresh the show by introducing new characters like Don's neighbors the Rosens. What they fail to realize is that such useless characters take screen time away from the characters that did make Mad Men great. It would have been nice to devote a few minutes following up on Ginsberg's blind date. It would have been nice to spend some time following up on Don and Betty's hook-up at the camp. Many other potentially rewarding story arcs are left dangling or just terminated without any sort of an attempt at a resolution. So what we have is a neverending series of vignettes patched haphazardly together but never merging into a cohesive whole.

For 4 or 5 years Mad Men was my favorite show. I couldn't wait for it to come on Sunday night. I would contact Amazon customer service to tell them to hurry up and put it in my library. It was, by far, the best show on television. Nothing else even began to approach its brilliance. Now its dead, but still being kept artificially alive by disinterested and tired actors, writers and producers. I'm certainly not subscribing to season 7. I'll wait for it to come out as a bargain bin Black Friday blu-ray just so I can complete my collection.",1370908800,,2053,4.616438356164384

The episodes are so choppy and they haven't really followed any of the story lines through with much detail, too busy jumping around showing people tripping on speed or hash or chasing rats in their apartments.  I still love ths show, but wish they would give Betty and Joan more plots, and wish they would stop wasting air time on the freaky drug trip shows that don't make any sense.  I don't mind the characters taking drugs, in fact that enhanses the show, but do they have to devote 2 episodes to it?",1370908800,,555,4.3173076923076925

I have loved the style, the storytelling, the nuance and the onion affect this show has, which is essentially like peeling an onion: there are many layers, you spill some tears, and stay engaged in the peeling process :-) However, something has been lost, and I sensed it in the middle of Season 5. I almost wish they had concluded the series, with Don walking away from Megan as she prepared for her commercial performance, and the next shot with Don huddled up to a bar, when a young, attractive woman sidles up to Don and asks, ""Are you alone?"" Long pause as the camera holds on Don's expression and.....roll credits! But essentially, I feel Matt Weiner has watered down the power this show has, by lightening the characters that orbit around Don to weak, supporting characters....we've lost what has been driving Don...yes! We get it! He's unhappy! But, what was driving Don was also the fear that who he is would be discovered, and like any great advertising campaign, all it needs is style, not substance. The years chipped away at his campaign, until who he really was, was finally exposed. Since then, I lost the mirth in the matter of MAD MEN, which I considered, up until the middle of last season, to be one of the best TV programs in the canon of TV history.

There is not enough great character driven TV shows around. Don Draper returns to his roots in S6 and as a viewer we get to know him better. I've so enjoyed watching Peggy's growth during a time when women started entering the workforce. A change of pace from simply being wives and mothers.

This season we see both Peggy and Joan's moving up the ladder differences almost face-off, but still come together because they both know what it took for each of them to get where they are and how it wasn't easy for either of them. And they relate and bond over it. It's just great writing.

The writers have done a great job creating characters and expressing them in a way we as viewers can feel for and understand. As a viewer that did not grow up during this time period, I can still feel what these characters felt. Starting from the first season its been a superb progression that starts out with almost serene, picture perfect families to their unhappiness, their boredom, their insecurities, and then being scared of change. To see the changes during this period of our time has made for awesome TV.

5199813,4,B00900WLBW,"Mad Men Season 6 does not have the same punch and plot payoffs of previous seasons but it remains one of the best and most unique television shows in history. The artistry of this show is unparalleled and the character development, writing and unique historical perspective is second to none. It also does not varnish the racial and sexist perspectives held by many in 60's America. I continue to be intrigued and fascinated by this show and its story development.",1370563200,,464,4.8125

One of my favorite things about this show is that it doesn't gloss over the 1960's and romanticize them (as so many young people seem to do) and I grew up in the 60's so I know.",1370563200,,318,3.9076923076923076

5199818,5,B00900WLBW,"Ever since I started watching Mad Men I have felt the nostalgia of my childhood. The delightful shock seeing the activities that are totally unacceptable now but were part of my everyday life growing up in the 1960s. Pregnant aunts drinking and smoking. Kids like myself bouncing around the backseat of the car seatbelt-less. Eight year olds fetching drinks for adults at neighborhood parties. Grown ups driving drunk. Bosses (Roger) saying all sorts of condescending yet, I must admit, hilarious things to women! All seems so foreign now but so familiar. At once shocking and comforting. I was hooked!
This season corresponds with the beginning of my adolescent years. Late 60's early 70's. I remember this time from a perspective changed from that of a child to that of a young teen. This season is presented from the same changed perspective.  Change for women, change for male/female relationships, more drug experimentation etc. These themes parallel my personal experience of going from the innocent viewpoint of an observant child to that of an more cognoscente adolescent; from vaguely sensing the hidden drama behind the benign outside presentation of adults in the early 60s to witnessing and sometimes experiencing the awakening of the late 60s and early 70s. As a young adolescent I became aware of the realities of war, sex, woman's new freedoms, and drug experimentation.  So personal nostalgia is the main reason I crave the show.
There is a very long list of other reasons, including the style of the show, the story lines, the frank treatment of touchy issues of the time (that are still relevant today) such as racial tensions, respect for women, class issues, marital fidelity (or lack thereof), the psychology of a philanderer, and most importantly the witty sharp dialog (Roger is my favorite) that pulls it all together. I recommend this to anyone who grew up in the 60s/70s and/or loves modernism and style.
Season 6 is about the hidden coming out into the open. Don likes to cheat; to hide. Now sex is openly available and not exciting for him. He is learning this season what is important to him. Don is a man of the past and is having a hard time with the present.",1370563200,75,2190,4.884408602150538
5199819,3,B00900WLBW,"I have been a fan since the beginning...but this season....NOT SO MUCH.  The acting is excellent, but the story line is too broken up.  I liked it best when their personalities were being defined.....and the characters seemed more cohesive throughout.",1370476800,,251,5.25

At this point, not even interested in what happens the rest of the season...looking for a new series to watch instead.

Time for a ""Dallas"" moment...make Don wake up and pretend the whole thing was a bad dream.  Reverse whatever writer changes you made, and get back to being the greatest series on TV.  Either that, or just fold up tent.

5199900,4,B00900WLBW,"As other reviews state, Mad Men seasons often take a few episodes to get in gear.  This season took the longest so far, and while I still haven't seen the entire season, I still feel like this season wasted hours toward the beginning, with inexcusably dull writing and frustratingly repetitive stories, taking up 5 episodes that made even the show's most diehard fans want to give up .  I like challenging TV (""The Wire"" is my absolutely favorite show), but I'm not convinced that boring your audience constitutes a challenge.  Besides, it's been done before, lots--albeit maybe not on purpose, or not for as long.

As plenty of other viewers have already stated, ""The Sopranos"" often used the same seasonal arc, but despite the lack of obvious action, it managed to squeeze in plenty of great writing and narrative tension, even--no, especially-- while nothing *seemed* to be happening.  The devil lay in the details in those episodes, little seeds of things that sometimes paid off later, or sometimes added even more texture to an already incredibly layered show.  In contrast, the early episodes of this season's MM felt like a bad and cheaply produced imitation of its old self:  like the writing staff went on vacation, the actors barely dialed in, and even the design and costume teams couldn't be bothered.  The show looked so bad, and the actors were so underused (Don lights a cigarette.  Peggy types.  Joan wiggles.  Pete cringes.  Roger babbles.  The end.  REALLY?), that I started wondering if AMC had yanked their funding, or if there was some kind of backstage drama on the show over salary negotiation, or even a strike I didn't know about.  Perhaps in some postmodern sense, these episodes mirror the lives of the characters, who seem disengaged from their work and lives.  I think that's stretching things--but the season's not over.  Maybe someday we'll all look back at Season Six and marvel at its brilliance.  I hope so.

Still, this isn't ""The Sopranos""--which is one of Mad Men's best qualities.  The Sopranos used grit, earthiness, violence, and banality colored by surrealism--sometimes a little, sometimes a lot, and broke through the fourth wall in subtle ways that will keep TV and cultural critics busy for decades.  For all the (often justified) comparisons with ""The Sopranos,"" ""Mad Men"" operates on its own rules, paints in its own palette and uses its own language--flash, pizzazz, sensation, fantasy and romance in rich Technicolor.  It was refreshing to see smart clothes, bright colors, optimistic characters, and Stylishness, sometimes for its own sake, woven into a TV show that could still be wicked, intelligent, fun and poignant.  I don't want to see Don Draper dressed in Tony Soprano's clothes (or Tony dressed in Don's clothes either  . . . )",1369440000,4,2787,4.9697624190064795

Adding to this review, since I'm only supposed to write one for the set. But a lot of the knock that folks are giving on season 6 is that there is not enough ""action"" but I've noticed especially by this episode that a huge part of the storyline for each episode is in the subtext... Spoilers beyond here.... But in the Better Half, part the subtext is the decline of New York. There's a good additional Peggy subtext plot too... Mad Men is not the kind of show with the characters speaking out for you every message...subtle cues in sound effects and scenes and 'throwaway lines' that really aren't throwaway lines. Not just where the subtext enters into the foreground action like with Peggy and Abe's break in event.  There are a lot of subtle clues that will help you enjoy the story if you look and listen and don't wait for the show to be obvious like Arrested Development or CSI.  Certainly this episode gave viewers several twists, even one that I've seen people pleading for for a couple of seasons (I don't expect too much from it though...)",1369267200,,1346,4.508196721311475

5199923,3,B00900WLBW,"I'm breaking my own rule here by reviewing a show before the season ends.  But I must say that this season has been a disappointment on almost every level.

The fact that ""Mad Men"" never really had much of a plot didn't bother me before because this show was always first and foremost about character development.  Of course, it was also brilliantly written, acted, and produced, which didn't hurt.  Maybe it's the era -- as a child of the seventies, I never much cared for my own coming-of-age period.  I hate the seventies fashions, loved the music, didn't really get the politics, and felt it was all just so lacking in glamour compared to the sixties.  To me, that was where ""Mad Men"" belonged and where they should have ended it.

Don Draper is deconstructing before our eyes this season, as he has seemed to in other seasons as well, but this has a different tone.  It's almost like the very dark period of ""The Sopranos"" when Tony got so dark and hideous even James Gandolfini wanted to kill him.  His philandering seems pointless and even he doesn't like it very much.  It's almost as if some alter-ego drives him to do this, and his kinkiness seems forced too.  Megan is a sort of flower-child narcissist -- albeit a very sweet one -- who really hasn't had much to do this season and their marriage seems beside the point.  Peggy's character has been interesting, as has Joan's, and I wish they would give them more to do.  As for Pete Campbell, his character is off-the-charts revolting.  Vincent Kartheiser is really over-acting in almost every episode and I have to fight myself not to turn it off.

I really miss Betty.  I never thought i would say that, but I do.  I hate the way they've fattened her up and dyed her hair black.  She was always so beautiful to watch and her clothes were so gorgeous, and I loved to hate her.  I don't get why they've reduced her role so much, but I do think it's a mistake.  Everyone else I talk to feels the same way.

Oh well.  The last two episodes --""The Man With a Plan"" and ""The Crash"" were far better.  Maybe there's hope.  But I still think they should have killed it at the end of last season.  That would have been beautiful.",1369267200,7,2183,4.424623115577889

5199925,2,B00900WLBW,"I absolutely LOVED Mad Men's first five seasons.  I watched them obsessively - watched the first season in a few days on Amazon.  But season 6 has been hugely disappointing.  Sure, Don has always been kind of a sleazebag with women, but this season he has turned into nothing BUT a sleazebag.  He's completely dull, completely narcissistic, completely lame.  The storyline with the neighbor he's having an affair with is so BORING.  I simply didn't care one iota whether he was with her, whether he wasn't, and the whole ""wait for me in this hotel room"" nonsense?  WTF?  WHO CARES?  Roger used to be funny and cool, but now he's boring.  Peggy used to be smart and interesting, but now she's boring.  Joan used to be sexy and smart, now she's boring.  Though the most interesting plotline this season has been the one where Joan went to the ER - but unfortunately, that ended with a thud like the rest of this season.

It's not the acting.  The acting is fine.  But the writing is SO. FREAKING. BORING.  I just don't care what happens to these characters anymore.  But I guess it's difficult to sustain such a great show for too long.  Maybe they should take a cue from Breaking Bad and just end it.",1369180800,4,1199,4.497674418604651

5199932,1,B00900WLBW,"I consider myself a fan of MadMen and I don't make it a regular habit of reviewing episodes or commenting on the show in general but since I purchased this episode on Amazon to watch and was asked to give feedback... here goes.

Certainly every MadMen episode is not superlatively interesting or entertaining to everyone.  There are a variety of characters in the show and various episodes explore those characters in different ways.  I have this thing I do when I am watching a movie or a TV show and it seems to be going nowhere fast:  I ask myself (or whomever I'm watching it with): ""What's this movie about?""  or ""What's this episode about?""  Essentially, I'm trying to figure out or point out that there is no cohesive plot--which is fine when you are watching America's Funniest Home Videos or How It's Made or American Pickers.  But when you are watching a series or a drama or certain other types of entertainment--there should be some kind of clear, explainable, understandable PLOT or PURPOSE.

With this particular episode of MadMen I found myself asking that question a lot and could never really get an answer.  There was a whole storyline about drugs, a storyline about Don & the neighbor's wife he's been banging on the side, and a storyline about a black woman breaking into Don's apartment when his kids were home alone and robbing the place.  And a few other minor storylines.  And repeated flashbacks to Don's childhood in a whorehouse as a sickly orphan.  And none of the above storylines was particularly engaging or even mildly entertaining.  It was just a mash-up of random storylines that didn't--in my opinon--advance the overall story of the series, nor shed any interesting light on any of the characters.

So, you may have to watch this episode to stay clued in for the next episode... but if you miss it, you probably won't miss anything too important.",1369094400,,1882,4.75076923076923
5199933,5,B00900WLBW,"I really started catching up to this show over the past couple of months and I totally was digging it. I was still finishing out season five a few weeks into this season and had to watch a bunch in a row. It is right away somewhat of a different pace than what we were used to before. First impression; All of the guys look like dorks now. Who gave Pete those sideburns? Right? Also, the sauve late fifties early sixties-isms have subtley faded into a new era, and while old fans were hoping for a perpetual 1962, it is in fact now, 1968. The times have ""a-changed.""

Relax though, I for one am crazy into the style, story telling and everything more than before. Though, I won't lie, I was always more of a Beatles blue album guy, than a red album guy.

While the episodes involving the art of the sell and the art of the ad may be a thing of the past, the show seems eager to flow with the pace of a decade that is memorialized in not one but two (if not several more) colors. These episodes for me glorify the art of the art, which I have to imagine was what the ad men at the time were seeking out as well.

But the swinging style is still alive here. That italian seductress down stairs from Don. The Dantes Inferno? I cannot get her out of my head. She should have been gone by episode 7, but in episode 8 I was so hoping for just maybe a peek of her on the elevator or something. I can't stop wishing she was in my kitchen every day when i get home, asking me if I want some cold roast beef and pop. The shows this season are great, can't wait to have them.

5199962,5,B00900WLBW,"Personally I like getting to know these characters better each year. Also, as the looming swell of the tsunami of the 60's is always in your mind, you wonder how they are going to deal with it. In Season 6, it is really starting to hit. But the actions and attitudes of the characters have not changed much yet. Will they?

The story of the women's movement is told in reactions and dialog of a small group of characters. You feel it when Peggy (the aspiring secretary who works herself up to creative on sheer talent) gets frustrated when she never gets credit for her ideas. Suburban housewife Betty and other assorted female characters spend their days living the Feminine Mystique. These women know something is wrong, but they don't know how to articulate it and try to heal their pain with divorce, drinking, sex, drugs and work. That ""the personal is political"", is what Carol Hanisch will say in an essay in 1968.

The deaths of Martin Luther King, John F Kennedy and Robert Kennedy are felt via TV broadcasts, riots and personal relationships. The loss of innocence is palpable as the young girl, Sally Draper, is told to watch TV and alone on the floor in the blue glow, watches in horror as a Buddhist Monk immolate himself on camera.

That highlights the fact that this is the only show where you see people actually watching TV and movies, not just the cliche bar TV with the convenient news clip to move the action along, but staring glazed eyed late at night at random crap like we do, except it is 60's random crap.",1368662400,,1531,4.5398550724637685
5199963,1,B00900WLBW,"Two problems:
1. The story line of the show
2. The quality on amazon
First, I'd like to vent about what the heck happened to this show? I like how they throw in the historical aspect (Martin Luther King, Kennedy, etc.) but then you have to suffer through 20 minutes/episode of Don having ANOTHER affair with some pathetic woman who hates her marriage. Come on, we get it. Don will always be unsatisfied. Why spend 3 episodes covering an affair with another woman he's just going to get tired of? Didn't we cover this in Season 1-5?
And then there is the episode with Betty, where you begin to (somehow) see her childish character develop. But it's just erased by her awkward selfish/jealousy of her husband's daughter, and the writer never touches up on the story of whether or not his daughter went to violin school or was ate by rats while helping poor kids in the ghetto.
Peggy's character is boring and you are forced to watch her save the day again, which is still not enough to make the show interesting. The only two likable characters are Don's secretary (who only has about 25 minutes of airtime) and Joan.
In summary, I regret buying the last 3 episodes. Total waste of money, they covered absolutely nothing, just sleazebag Don crawling back into bed after cheating on his wife. Shocking.

And now for the quality on Amazon. Surprisingly I've never had problems before buying episodes or movies on Amazon, but I am extremely disappointed in the quality (or lack of) Season 6 of Mad Men. Several episodes I had to download at least twice for them to play correctly. Amazon does not offer an explanation, other than to contact customer service  .

Geez - last season he was journalling alone in his sad-man bachelor pad for godsakes... This season - he is truly unlikeable - but not in a good way.  Where as his motivation to cheat used to be intriguing, and his philandering prior to this season was part of a flawed troubled guy with secrets -- now it's just old and gross. I really thought last season - that Don's marriage to Megan could be interesting - and actually stretch this guy beyond some worn out story about a man who has no ability what so ever to be faithful. Megan's character has so much more potential than this. Basically - if this is just a transitional season - so be it. But I'm beginning to care less about any of it - because nothing is really evolving for any of the characters. It's like revving is second gear - now seven episodes in. Because it is Mad Men - I'm hanging in there. But the potential of the late 60's cultural setting and the characters has more potential than this.",1368489600,,1084,4.262135922330097

I just wish they didn't suddenly have Don go back to become a loathsome alcoholic for no apparent reason. Of course he's always had a hand on a bottle; but we used to have more clues as to why he was behaving that way. Now, not only is Don mysterious to his coworkers and everyone around him, but he's mysterious to the viewer.

The fifth episode, about Martin Luther King's assassination, seemed a bit flat at times (particularly concerning the urban violence that occurred after the killing), but still contained Jon Hamm's finest moment as an actor since Season 4.

I will be sorry to see this change...and don't understand the need to stay on a timeline.

5200031,5,B00900WLBW,"i notice that after 280 reviews that this show has an aggregate rating of three stars.  i've read some of the reviews and amazon viewers in general seem to be underwhelmed with the show. i have been reading post episode analyses online plus listening to NPR podcasts about Mad Men.  this amazon view is not being repeated there nor do i share it.  i like the series as much as i ever did.

take a look at the poster shown on this page for the show.  that is don draper both coming and going.  look at the signs around him and the disjointedness of the art work.  it is not an uplifting poster!  this season opens at the end of 1967 and then jumps right into 1968 and the country as a whole is coming apart, just like the poster.  so it is not just don draper's world which is being torn.

at the end of last season, much was made of the woman coming up to don and asking him ""are you alone?"". much has been written about whether that meant don was going to return to being a philanderer.  i looked at the question in its larger sense.  is this man alone inside of himself, forever isolated from really connecting with anyone?  to me the answer is obvious.  he is the probably the most alone man one could ever encounter. and this time period leads into an era of alienation for the american population unlike any it had known before. parents are about to be alienated from their children as they never have been before, just as one gigantic shift.  so, as usual, don is ahead of the times.

as for the other characters, fascinating things are going on for them as well.  we can see that women who want to get out of the straight jacketed post war existence finally have a glimmer of hope for doing so.  peggy and joan are far from being as miserable as the men around them.  even trudy campbell begins to show her mettle!

the creative workers, the artists, in the advertising business, also begin to look like people are going to look in decades ahead. they are also experimenting more with the changes in lifestyles. also, television is becoming more and more a vital part of everything going on, including advertising.  every time we are told a huge event has taken place it is via the tv, not by print or radio.

the creator of this series, matthew weiner, is obviously very interested in this era and the huge societal changes which took place during it and would continue to take place at an ever faster rate.  as someone who came of age during this era, it is fascinating for me to look back and see it unfold from a much broader perspective.

i think this season is well worth viewing but, again, i am a minority view here on amazon apparently.

The only good line in the whole season is when Joan tells that disgusting, fat client from Jaguar ""There's a part of you that you haven't seen in years,"" after he has the temerity to suggest to her ""Joan, you know there's a part of you that's glad to see me.""

Well, I sure wasn't glad to waste my money on this season--even for Joan's clever one-liner.",1367884800,4,527,4.494736842105263

The first few episodes were a little subpar, but The Flood was an excellent episode, dealing with the assasination of Martin Luther King.  I loved the subplot with Peggy & Abe planning for their future.  Elisabeth Moss is an excellent actress. I especially liked William Mapother's kooky character.

It makes you want to kick off your shoes, pour yourself  nice glass of scotch, and light up a cigarette (i don't even smoke!). Honestly, I think that this season in particular reminds me of the first coupe of seasons. Don is back to his old tricks and Betty looks as if she is about to make a comeback!

It's also getting harder to believe that anyone could be as serially casual about relationships as Don Draper is, but perhaps I have led a sheltered life.

The impetus of this episode is the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.  Everyone is shocked, naturally, but other that guilt-ridden empathy, the characters and the story schreech to a stand still.  Why??!  No of the characters really care (despite some unforeseen latent racial activism from Pete (of all people!).  Don's secretary, the token African American, gets barely 30 seconds of time.  This whole episode just stinks!

As to the season thus far, Don as a character has reverted to old behavior (his seeming uncontrollable sexual behavior).  Don is again married to a gorgeous, and this time around, caring wife.  Yet he is willing to chuck all of this away on an affair that seeminly doesn't matter to him emotionally.  Why does Don do this?  Why is he allowed to get away with this behavior with no consequences.  For once, I'd like to see Don bitch-slapped by Megan for the self-centered jerk that he is.  I'm tired of the writers teasing us with glimpses of Don's childhood to use as an excuse for Don's self-destructing behavior (although he is never allowed to fully self-destruct).  Writers---PLEASE move Don forward, backward, sidewises, anywhere!!.

The nicest part was seeing Betty go out of her way to look for her daughter's runaway friend on the lower east side. But the show is way too dark, and to no effect.

They've been replaced by speakerphone bitch-fests with her old nemesis, Stan, which have resulted in Peggy's being forced by her new boss to betray her old one.  Megan Draper, the girl we could almost always count on to bring the groovy, playful side of the 60s to squelch the stuffed-shirt sexism of the 50s, has suffered an unthinkable loss and was last seen taking to her bed, pale and sans makeup, curled up in a ball of misery -- and this is BEFORE she has found out what games boink-'em-all hubby is playing with his best friend's wife.  It's all feeling very much like we've stumbled into an episode of Berkshire Falls, Megan's soap opera gig.  That said, Matthew Weiner isn't one to disappoint, and I've been just as glued to the screen as I was during the lighthearted ""Mad Men"" days of office pot parties and the sweet sizzle of every Joan-Don  tte--tte. However, as Season 6 unfolds I'm hoping we see a little more of the fun and frolic which always helped to balance the underlying grit.  A little more Sally would help.  Or perhaps a Sterling Cooper office party.

On a technical note I've had serious issues with playback quality on the streaming the episodes fromk amazon prime.  Several times i've been dropped from HD to SD in the middle of episodes even though the wireless bandwidth is fine as measured using a wireless download tester where my streaming device is; and absolutely no issues streaming HD via netflix. It's pretty irritating to pay for an HD version of a show and then get dropped to an SD version with no form of renumeration: yes, these are spoiled first world person problems, but its not cool to pay for a service and then be told halfway through that you don't qualify and oh by the way no refund .",1367107200,4,1158,4.671568627450981

5200103,5,B00900WLBW,"When things get bad, we tend to look to the past. And the bleaker the future looks, the further back we search for comfort. As the new millennium keeps disappointing us, TV shows set on the 50's and the 60's (once a rarity) keep growing in numbers. Many have tried and failed. MAD MEN tried and closed the deal. And have been doing so for 6 seasons now.

Meet Don Draper (Jon Ham), a Madison Avenue water-walker (and based on real life ad man, George Lois). He is an enigma wrapped in a mystery. He is brilliant and secretive. He wants to keep walking the tight rope with no safety net. And definitely no contract. He is a chain-smoking, hard liqueur guzzling, womanizing alpha male. He is a loving father of three, married to a picture-perfect ex model. He has it all. And yet he cannot find peace. Because he learned early on that the world is always yawning at your heels, eager to yank everything you love away.

From bursting with joie-de-vivre Roger Sterling (hilarious John Slattery) and ever scheming Pete Cambell (baby-faced Vincent Kartheiser) to the gorgeous women (such as barbie January Jones and refined Jessica Par as his first and second wife, respectively), the cast is one perfect pick after another. And the writing is brilliant, reproducing the tastes and smells and nuisances of the era around Camelot, while drawing you in to the personal stories of characters polished yet inevitably flawed.

The 50's and the 60's were before my time so it is not nostalgia that makes me love the show. Yes, I find the era mesmerizing and (probably undeservingly) less complicated. If nothing else, though, back then they knew how to dress. Women looked feminine and men looked manly. You see January Jones on the red carpet, for example, all dressed up and groomed for a Hollywood function - and that modern image cannot hold a candle to herself dressed for everyday(!) life in the early 60's. When did we loose it? When did we decide men should stop wearing suits and hats and women should start wearing sweat-suits outside the house? I, for one, blame the hippies!

This is one of the best TV shows ever and this box-set includes the ongoing season 6. Season 7 has been green-lighted  whereas we can only hope that the show will not stop there. As I have said again before, good TV is best watched on DVD. Make weekends out of it. It is much more enjoyable to watch an entire season in a couple of days than having to wait week(s) between episodes. And (quite ironically, in this case), you will not have to suffer the...commercials.

5200107,4,B00900WLBW,"I like Mad Men because I lived on the East Coast, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut during that era and many of my friends in college had parents with jobs on Wall Street. My own parents were academics, and so I gazed upon the NY Wall St. scene with amazement. I came to realize how much a person's professional reputation meant to them, and because many of  these parents I observed were women ( even though working women are supposedly not encouraged in Mad Men) I realized that either gender could suffer horribly from the terror of being sniped at, judged, threatened, and made to feel inadequate on the job. The women I knew drank a lot and went in for competitive poker games.  They were very disapproving of ""college girls"" like me because we didn't dress well enough; they had a particular grouch about pony tails (hair drawn back with a rubber band): the very idea that we were getting along with boys our age without the bother of dressing up all the time disturbed them.  My mother made me write ""Thank you notes"" (a very 'fifties' obsession) and I actually liked the fact that Mrs. X, my New York hostess, always criticized my thank you notes. I wrote them as a boring chore and she called me on it!  Anyway, life was tough for grownups in those days.  So I feel a lot of sympathy, and even a sneaking sort of admiration, from those poor Wall Street types, usually quite talented people who were wasting their time on junk, escaping via booze, sex, and cigarettes. To them, it seemed unimaginable that this life style would ever be seen as quaint old-fashioned weakness and Bad Habits.

Also having lived during this time period I can pretty much say that in 1968, a person like Don Draper would not have said so casually that he was opposed to the Vietnam War. In past episodes he either ignored or refused to state a political view.

Is that what people did in the 60's? Everyone made out with everyone and they did drugs all the time and were depressed? I find it hard to believe, but if so, I'm glad I wasn't an adult in the 60's. I don't want to watch a show where everyone is constantly depressed, drinking, sleeping around and leading meaningless lives.

You can tell that they hired new writers that don't know how follow the first five seasons in quality. The character development is really really bad. Ugggh.

I just don't watch it, but then mad men came along. maybe it was the period, maybe its because I worked for grey advertising,or maybe its the best show on tv ever period. I love & hate the characters. everyone is so real with flaws that true human beings have. so im on 6 seasons now, and some characters are seeing the beginning of their comeuppance. don't we all wish this happened in real life? but maybe they won't really get there, its just fascinating and now that the 60's are coming to a close, I'm thrilled that this historical drama is getting in touch with our most turburlant times.

I can't stand to watch any scene with Megan in it and Don's affair is really feeling like they have run out of ideas.

5200147,5,B00900WLBW,I just discovered this program within the last month.  I grew up during the 60's and it seems I missed quite a bit of the wild life depicted in Mad Men.  Don Draper is a character that one both loathes and pities but at the same time want to see him redeem himself at some point --- even though he probably is not capable of changing.  The show has wonderfully defined characters that support the story and I watch not just to see what Don will do next but to witness the evolution of the rest of the cast.

5200148,4,B00900WLBW,"I lived in New York City's East Village from roughly 1967 through the 1980s.  All of Manhattan was my stomping ground and after coming from semi-rural suburbia, I total identify with Don saying ""I want to see skyscrapers.""  Some of the things I've seen so far in Season 6 that bother me because they don't ring true:

1.  The unbridled use of pot in the offices (like it was booze).  Sorry, but I don't care how creative the office was, there were not people lighting up joints whenever they felt like it, wherever they felt like it.  Marijuana was strictly illegal and off limits.

2.  The tenement building that Betty visited looking for the young girl who was Sally's friend.  I lived in several different tenement apartments back in the day and can tell you that they were nothing like the bombed out wreck that was shown in the episode.  The building in the episode actually looks like a contemporary ghetto crack house, not an authentic EV dive.  The old EV apartments, even in the demilitarized zone east of First Avenue, were palaces compared to what was shown.  It was simply not authentic.

3.  The Hippy costumes (and I am a HUGE fan of all MM costumes) were off.  They also looked too contemporary.  I think the clothes from the 60s, both for men and women, were way more interesting than what the MM characters are wearing.

As far as the story line, it seems to be a little disjointed and also there's a lack of cohesion.  I get the feeling that I'm watching a series of little vignettes rather than getting the big picture.  On the other hand, this may all be deliberate, who am I to say.

Despite these minor criticisms, I am a big fan of Mad Men forever and will continue to watch each episode at least three times!",1366761600,22,1732,4.472843450479234

5200155,1,B00900WLBW,"I'm a huge Mad Men fan to say the least. I've enjoyed the first 5 seasons, although Season 5 had signs of what to come in Season 6. So far, the show has no direction and feels very fragmented. As if Matthew Weiner ran out of ideas and just scrambling to come up with small story lines to fill in each episode. In fact, Christina Hendricks was a guest of Jon Stewart last night, and when asked to comment on the story line of the Season 6, she mentioned that each year when she had asked Weiner, he had given her an outline of the entire season before they aired the first episode. Apparently, when she did the same this year, Weiner -for the first time- told her ""I don't know, I just don't know"", which perfectly captures the vibe of the show this year.

I hope it gets better but doesn't seem like it. Don't you hate to see shows that you love drag without any purpose/goal? Who is looking forward to Season 7, since they won't even remotely consider ending the series after this season?",1366675200,5,989,4.288770053475936

Unfortunately, this season (Season 6) has started as an epic fail and I am praying it picks up later on. Although Mad Men has never been a fast-paced drama, all the previous seasons were filled with juicy suspensful plots and compelling intrigue especially from the engmatic Don Draper. This season, not only falls flat, but I found it unnecessarily cryptic and obtusely vague! I am not certain what direction the directors are going with this season but if this pace continues, (as it did towards the end of Season 5) they are going to lose a lot of avid fans, such as myself.  Never understand why great shows have directors messing up with a good formula. Hopefully, this will not be the end of another quality show with amazing potential!",1366675200,3,876,4.651612903225806

EDIT 1:

Watched Season 6 Episode 9 and I'm afraid this has become a soap opera.  The characters & situations are just going around and around in circles, getting more melodramatic with each pass.

It's as if the thing that made this show truly great just isn't there anymore.  Still worth watching but no longer exceptional.

EDIT 2:

Have watched the first 6 episodes of Season 7, and the magic is back.  The story lines are good, interaction of the characters is spot-on.  Very happy to see how they pulled themselves back together to make this last season as good as the best of previous seasons.

If you gave up on Season 6, I suggest you go back, watch just the last episode of Season 6 only... and then go on to Season 7.

One thing I don't see in other reviews is praise for how good an actor January Jones really is.  She's able to radiate pure sweet loving kindness or utter stone cold rage without even saying a word.

A sexually amoral compulsive womanizer/empathetic altruist going into PTSD (post tryst?)? Can your usual audience stand it? Please, though, protect the doc. I like him and unless he happens to be a complete psychopath himself, let him find his muse and go off to join Mdecins Sans Frontires or some such. But, the ""he already intuitively knows"" thing would be a disappointment to my perception of your ability. Anyway, my concern for him makes the tryst scenes with his wife just too uncomfortable, that you will have him walk in unknowing. I don't watch TV much (John and Stephen only on the net) but, during a recent period of some stress and reading wasn't working, ran out of movies and docus and watched all 5 previous seasons back to back (and belly to belly) stoned on my tuchus which seems to have made me a fan of the same level of credulity as your autograph seeker in Hawaii.

But it's grown tiresome and worn out its welcome. I'm sick of watching the rampant adultery and boozing. The only reason I watch it now is to see if Don Draper and the others will finally get their comeuppance. I can't blame the producer Matthew Weiner for the decline and fall of Mad Men.

Iceberg theory is all well and good but what is going on in a story shouldn't always be a scavenger hunt. Not that it wasn't intelligent episode.

The only thing that didn't ring true for me was don's meeting scene everyone else ranted and rave about. Maybe because I have worked in sales and offices in the past. It seemed too dumb what don did and completely predictable. So many other characters even minor ones had better lines and scenes than that. You see whole new sides to characters you thought were one way but turn out to be something completely differant entirely.

Apparently; the regular writers weren't back from vacation for this one.

Nothing much happened.  No draw to see the next one; although I will just out of respect for the amazing writing in the first 5 seasons.  What a disappointment.

EDIT:
Changed it to 4-star for episode 3.
1. They got rid of the Betty side story.  Good riddance!

2. Focused on Don and friends and their ""madness"".  Loved seeing weasel (Pete) getting caught at cheating and his wife laying down the law.  She just looks dumb.

3. Focused on the late 60's ambiance.

I'd find plenty to complain about, because it's so easy to criticize from an arm chair.  But overall; I found it thoroughly entertaining and nothing to be annoyed at.

So - Mad Men, you're back!  Keep this up and I'll revise it to a 5-star.
Cheers!

I even tried to watch the opening double episode again, to see if I could find all this profundity and symbolism in it. But all I saw was stodgy Don being embarassed by any show of human joy or play -- ""no, don't ask me to dance!""; and Don and his wife having what appeared to be the most tacky, conventional look at Hawaii and this somehow becoming another in the long string of epiphanies Don has when he travels west, that never last more than one episode. Then distracted Don makes a pitch that forgets to include the product being pitched and suggests a death wish -- a pitch that surely the Don Draper we know would never make. Even worse is any scene involving Betty. Her one-note delivery has not been enhanced by the ""fat"" make-up that they have her in. We still have no idea who Betty is and we don't care. We know her to be petty, mean, proper and once in a while strangely kind, but January Jones is unable to endow her with depth (or shallowness) and her excursions just suck oxygen from the screen. But wait, there is relief! Every time Elisabeth Moss is on the screen it feels as if she is single-handedly pulling that screen into order and gifting the scene with coherence. What we see her do isn't very interesting, but we watch with relief because Peggy works as a character. Unfortunately, Peggy can't salvage the show. Only Don Draper could do that, and he has to be one of the most deadly lotharios ever to hit the culture. His hidden past seems played out now; his philandering is boring even to him; one really wouldn't want to be him anymore. Roger too has become an incoherent character, a mouthpiece for second-rate philosophizing whose final explosion of tears at his mom's death didn't read as real. And what of Joan? Christina Hendricks in this episode finally gets to be just a jutting bosom. Great work, Mr Weiner. You just don't know what to do with this fine actress, do you? She can't be part of the Peggy success arc, so what is to become of her? She is just good at what she does, and straightforward about it. As Roger says, Joan will know what to do. Indeed, but will you? I guess she needs some adversity, and then are you going to have Don finally turn to her, or what? It's a tough one. If you solve it, you might have a new storyline that could save the series, which used to be the best thing on TV.",1365897600,4,2460,4.35

It's pure dreck. Take a look at who is now producing the new season and I think it may explain why the sudden downturn in quality writing and plot formation. John Hamm is the new producer ! He has also been directing as well and I'm thinking that he may be to blame for this terrible new season thus far.

At the end of it, finally being all caught up, I was excited that I would be able to see the new episode the following weekend.

Imagine my surprise and HUGE disappointment when the anticipated 2-hour premiere rolled around...and it was such a disjuncted snooze-fest that, honestly, I kept pausing the DVR to do something else and eventually started checking my email while the episode kept playing in the background.

5200297,2,B00900WLBW,"I want the old Mad Men back. It is painfully clear that the writers are riding the wave of publicity this show gets and letting it sail off into syndication.

What originally attracted me to this show is gone. The cutting edge company, the turmoil of the ad business, the competition, the intense character development, the business that made these ordinary people truly ""mad"", all left with season 3. The show would now be more aptly called ""The Adventures Of Don and Rodger - and who cares"". Far to little time is spent on the other cast members (with the exception of Peggy) to make the audience care about any of them. I am surprised the show is able to retain these actors season after season. Although this season seems to have brought significant turnover (Don's ad team).

The audience has patiently collected bits and pieces of Don's mysterious past along the way but what he is hiding seems to be moot now and at this point I am not sure I care any more. He is still rich, hard cold, in charge and surrounded by women that have lost the ""new car"" appeal. Nothing about his character has changed.

And then there is good old recession-proof Rodger. After 5 seasons, I still do not have a clue what he does.

I will be waiting for this season to hit NetFlix and then I'll watch the rest of it.",1365379200,19,1301,4.430962343096234
5200298,4,B00900WLBW,wont post any links here..but there's plenty of sites saying they're contractually committed for 7 seasons..although that could change..I'm glad Amazon has the episodes NEXT DAY for streaming the re-run times for the show seems to compensate those with DVR's (which i gave up in 2005) with 3am Wednesday and Sunday morning 8am...Friday 10:30 isn't any good for me as that's my night out..Thanks AMZ for having the eps up...,1365379200,,423,5.057142857142857
5200299,2,B00900WLBW,"I sometimes wonder why I believe these things.  Of course they are too good to be true.  t.v. pass?  Uh, I don't know.  I purchased it and I can't watch it.  When can I watch it.  I should have stuck to the old way and paid the 1.99.  At least then I could have watched it on time.  As for a review of the show?  I noticed other reviews are not too great but I remember every season of Mad Men always starts out with a rather mundane episode.  It builds as the season progresses.  I'm asking Amazon for my money back though.  I'll just stick to using ITunes to watch it.",1365379200,6,570,3.9910714285714284
