8387083,5,B0031LWA9O,I was impressed by the quality of this DVD and found the tips to be very helpful.  It was reassuring to hear all about the modeling industry from such down-to-earth models.  I especially enjoyed the segment on modeling myths.  I never knew that becoming a model wasn't all that complicated.,1262649600,,290,4.76
