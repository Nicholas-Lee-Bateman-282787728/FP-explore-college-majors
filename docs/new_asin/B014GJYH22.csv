8730688,3,B014GJYH22,"Had to agree with previous comments that the camera work of this video is terrible. Zooming on background characters faces mid dance for example is totally unacceptable for a dance video. You can understand the frustration as you are at total mercy of the film editor.

On the production itself, the costume design is a failure if it was intended to be designed in a ""modern"" setting. The men's shorts and singlets don't work with the Bournonville style. It improved in Act 3 as soon as they put on say, more clothes. The casual talking/flirting/arguing mixed with dancing is just awkward.

Nevertheless I'm sure the somewhat negative impression of the ballet is more due to the camera work. I too, prefer the previous production but it's a good attempt to put a new spin on a traditional piece. I'm sure we will enjoy more if we watch it in the theatre.",1497139200,,854,4.6490066225165565
8730689,4,B014GJYH22,"Hard to describe this mixed bag.  In second act where music and choreography has been re-written it is hauntingly beautiful music and dance.  First act is more mime than ballet and brought into 50's.  Wonderful acting and direction, but just a different art form.  Third act is more traditional dance and a lot of it.  Very energetic.  Great costumes, scenery, and stagecraft.  I personally am not a great fan of Alban Lendorf.  He looks more like a weight lifter than a dancer and has a certain tightness, lack of grace in his dance.  I think Benjamin Buza is a more graceful dancer.  Alexandra Lo Sardo is quite beautiful, lovely dancer and brings her role to life.  All-in-all many wonderful touches, a lot of energy, just not sure if it's a ballet or what!",1465430400,4,760,4.639097744360902
8730690,2,B014GJYH22,"What a disappointment! I've seen the previous version released on DVD (Villumsen/Hindberg) and the version (when Frank Andersson was Ballet Master) live at The Royal Danish Theater in 2005. This is by far the worst version. Apart from the poor production the filming was terrible too. It seems as the filmmaker tried his very hardest to NOT showcasing the Bournonville choreography (very often filmed in strange angles. Ballet is a scenic art to mainly being watched from the audience's point of view). Not even in act III could we sit back and enjoy the dancing - simply because the camera zoomed in from the wings, on people in the back. Basically the choreography was lost.
Buy out of curiousity - but don't expect anything great. If you want to enjoy Bournonville's Napoli in your living room - buy the old DVD with Villumsen/Hindberg instead.",1460937600,5,847,4.888888888888889
8730691,3,B014GJYH22,"Forget the first two acts and play Act 3 to see real Bournonville dances. Act I is full of unpleasant characters , colorless costumes and too much smoking. Act II is unnecessary. Act III needs a little trimming but it is the real Napoli that one can remember from the beautiful Bournonville
Dances of the Ballet in America Series years ago. Alban Lendorf ( Gennaro ) is the star of this performance.",1452211200,4,399,4.555555555555555
