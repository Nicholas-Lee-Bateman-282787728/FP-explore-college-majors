1011051,4,6305261326,"From the retrospective included on the disc you get the impression that star Angie Dickinson thought she was making high art.  I'm not so sure Roger Corman thought so.  The film seems to have a split personality.  Stars Dickinson, Tom Skerritt, and William Shatner play their characters pretty straight to the vest.  The script, however, suggests a parody of ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with alot of comic violence and gunplay and humorously gratuitous nudity.  I did enjoy the contributions of the young actresses playing Dickinson's daughters, Susan Sennett and Robbie Lee.  I purchased this film expecting some trashy fun and it did deliver the goods.",1135814400,20,645,5.153846153846154
1011052,4,6305261326,"Big business can make for strange bedfellows as is the case here, with the recently re-released film Big Bad Mama (1974).  Seems not too long ago The Walt Disney Corporation, through their Buena Vista Home Entertainment group, acquired the rights to release onto DVD some 400 Roger Corman films, including this one...if you're not familiar with Roger Corman, he probably the single, largest producer of low-budget exploitation films in the last 50 years, features someone generally wouldn't associate with the Walt Disney image.  Produced by Corman, co-written by William W. Norton (White Lightning, I Dismember Mama) and Frances Doel (Deathsport, DinoCroc), and directed by Steve Carver (Lone Wolf McQuade), the film stars Angie Dickinson, who first made an impression on me as Sgt. Suzanne ""Pepper"" Anderson in the mid to late 1970s television series ""Police Woman"".  Also appearing is William `The Shat' Shatner (""Star Trek"", Kingdom of the Spiders), Tom Skerritt (MASH, Alien), Susan Sennett (The Candy Snatchers), Robbie Lee (Switchblade Sisters), Noble Willingham (The Last Picture Show), Dick Miller (X: The Man with the X-Ray Eyes), Tom Signorelli (The Cotton Club), Royal Dano (Killer Klowns from Outer Space), William O'Connell (Every Which Way But Loose), and Joan Prather, whom some may remember from the television series ""Eight Is Enough"", as Janet McArthur Bradford.

The movie, set in the depression era south, begins as we see three women, one older, two younger, heading to church.  Seems recent widower Wilma McClatchie (Dickinson) is taking her two daughters, Billy Jean (Sennett) and Polly (Lee) to the church as Polly done got herself engaged to a dirt farmer.  The trio arrives, met by skeezy Uncle Barney (Willingham), a bootlegger by trade, shortly followed by the groom, showing up on the back of a truck...I must say, he's quite the prize pig...anyway, Wilma seems unhappy with her youngest daughter's choice in men, and promptly puts the kibosh on the affair in the middle of the nuptials, as she decides she wants better for her girls.  A good, old fashioned ruckus ensues, and the three women, along with Uncle Barney, skedaddle...right into a trap set by a lawman named Bonney (Miller), who's been chasing Barney the bootlegger for some time.  There's a car chase, and Barney ends up with a terminal case of lead poisoning, to which Wilma decides to take over the business, thus beginning her life of crime.  After the bottom falls out of her moonshine business (thanks to a corrupt local sheriff), Wilma and her girls, who are about as ripe as Georgia peaches, fleece a crooked preacher, and then get tangled up with a bank robbery, eventually taking on one of the robbers, named Fred Diller (Skerritt), as a partner, in more ways than one, if you know what I mean...homina, homina...Wilma, deciding it wise never to pull the same caper more than once, decides their next score will be a race track, where they meet Captain Kirk...er, I mean William J. Baxter (Shatner), an upper-class hustler, resulting in another partnership, along with more of Ms. Dickenson doffing her clothes...set phasers on stunning!  Anyhoo, the group makes their way west, to California, with Sheriff Bonney hot on their heels, and Wilma comes up with one last big score, involving kidnapping a comely, yet snooty, heiress (Prather) and ransoming her off for a million bucks...but jealousies threaten to tear the group apart, along with their ever increasing notoriety.

I've seen plenty of exploitation films in my time, but few do them as well as Roger Corman.  That's not to say his touch is always gold, but he usually manages to finagle more than most of out so very little.  I think the one aspect about this production that elevates it to the upper echelons within the B movie realm is the strong and capable cast, especially Ms. Dickenson, who, in her forties at the time, looked better than the females half her age appearing in this film, and that's not to say they were hard on the eyes (the actress playing Polly seemed to have the most difficult time keeping her top on).  She provided an exceptionally strong, intelligent, determined female character, one who knew what she wanted, and knew how to get it...overall I really enjoyed this gangster drama with a feminine twist.  Director Carver keeps story moving along well, which included predictable twists, exciting car chase and gunplay sequences, along with a whole lot of freaky deaky...check out the scenes where Tom Skerritt's character, after getting replaced as Wilma's bed warmer by The Shat's character, hooks up with her daughters, in a creepy. Southern fried threesome.  And then there's the scene near the end when Skerrit's character is seduced by the kidnapped heiress (in an attempt by her to escape), and The Shat creepily watches on from the doorway...but never fear, The Shat does get his groove on in one, particularly revealing scene with Ms. Dickenson...thankfully, for myself at least, his nekkidness is covered up by her nekidness (actually, Ms. Dickenson has about three or four gratuitous nekkid scenes, if you're looking for that kind of thing).  As far as the acting goes, its better than I expected, given the amount of experience in the cast, both in recognizable actors and character actors.  And how could you not like a script that features lines like this?  ""Uncle Barney...was you trying to feel up my Mama?""  Oh Uncle Barney...whotta sleaze...the story is decent enough, as there seemed to be attempts to flesh out the various relationships, but it never really went to far which was good because that really wasn't something I was looking for in a movie like this...another aspect I really liked was the ending, as I thought it a great way to wrap things up.

The fullscreen (1.33:1) picture on this DVD release looks decent, but does show some signs of age.  I'm betting the quality here is the same as the previous DVD release, so if you own that, and that's all you care about, there probably isn't much reason to be sucked in by this `Special Edition' release.  The Dolby Digital 2.0 audio is decent enough, with no complaints.  As far as extras, there is a featurette titled `Mama Knows Best: A Retrospective' (14:38), that includes Corman, Dickenson, The Shat, and a number of people involved with the film discussing their experiences, all looking quite old and crusty.  Also included is a commentary track with Corman and Dickenson, and a rough, original theatrical trailer.

By the way, the film apparently did well enough to warrant a sequel titled Big Bad Mama II (1987), featuring Ms. Dickenson.  I haven't seen it, and doubt I will as the DVD, which is currently out of print, seems to be a bit over priced...love them gougers...maybe Disney will re-release it, too...",1134777600,20,6805,4.987632508833922
1011053,3,6305261326,"I feel like a fraud, because I have not recently seen this film.  I just wanted to let 'a viewer' in Stockton know that I knew Robbie Lee [actress playing Polly] in 1972.  I was almost 13 and in 7th grade, and she was just out of high school.  So I would guess she was close to 20 [give or take a year] when this film was made.",1120089600,5,327,3.7794117647058822
1011054,5,6305261326,"I consider myself well schooled in low budget schlock from various film genres. Watching cheesy films is an acquired taste, one not easily cultivated overnight. Even with some knowledge about who makes these types of films under my belt, I still stumble over major contributors to the clunker movie catalogue and wonder why I haven't spent time with these delicacies before now. Roger Corman is my latest discovery. I admit I have heard of Corman before in reference to the spate of Vincent Price horror classics that emerged in the 1960s, along with a few other films he made over the course of his career, but until now I never saw many of them. This guy is a giant of the low budget film, producing or directing some 500 plus movies in the last forty years. He's still going strong as far as I know, and never limits his output to one particular genre; he's made westerns, horror, action, drama, and science fiction films with seeming ease. Moreover, according to the bio on this DVD, Corman helped launch the careers of numerous Hollywood bigwigs. If ""Big Bad Mama"" is any indication, I will continue to spend a lot of time with this filmmaker's projects in the near future.

""Big Bad Mama"" is a sort of feminist reinterpretation of those movies about Depression era highway outlaws; it's ""Bonny and Clyde"" with lipstick and long tresses. Angie Dickinson plays Wilma McClatchie, a mule headed, dirt poor Texas woman with a temper and a desire to better her conditions. Life hasn't been easy for Wilma, not with two young daughters to raise in a ramshackle cabin out in the sticks. What's a woman to do during these tough times? Why, strike up a relationship with local bootlegger Barney (Noble Willingham), of course! But when the wedding ceremony of one of Wilma's daughters goes horribly awry, and Barney perishes in a shootout, Wilma is left holding several unpleasant bags. The Feds involved in bringing down Barney, led by Bonney (Richard Smith), now set their sights on Wilma and her kids. Unfortunately, McClatchie plays right into their hands by taking over Barney's illicit liquor operation. At some point, Wilma decides she's had enough of being poor and decides to hit the road in search of ill-gotten gains. She takes her two lascivious daughters, Polly (Robbie Lee) and Billy Jean (Susan Sennett), along for the ride. And why not? If you're going to embark on a crime spree, you may as well make it a family affair.

Problem is, Wilma cannot escape the lure of sleazy, good for nothing men. She first hooks up with wanted criminal Fred Diller (Tom Skerritt), and quickly consummates their partnership the old fashioned way. Then conman extraordinaire William Baxter (William Shatner) enters the picture, and Wilma brings him into the fold as well. The resulting jealousy between Diller and Baxter, along with a most unusual relationship struck up between Diller and Wilma's daughters, will certainly lead to dangerous tensions within the gang. Despite these internal stresses, Wilma continues to plot the next big score. The gang finally stumbles upon the perfect scheme; they will infiltrate a soiree thrown by a bunch of rich folks and kidnap one of them. McClatchie and her compatriots succeed in abducting Jane Kingston (Joan Prather), but the plan fouls up when Diller decides to get up close and personal with the hapless heiress. Then Baxter pulls a fast one. Then the cops and the G-men close in. Cue gunfire and crashing cars. Roll credits. Who will live and who will perish? Surprisingly, you'll actually care about the answer to that question while watching ""Big Bad Mama.""

I've seen several Corman classics now, and ""Big Bad Mama"" ranks as one of the better ones. First, you've got a solid cast filling all the main roles. Dickinson not only looks fantastic, but she believably portrays a poor woman looking out for her own with nothing to lose. Tom Skerritt, an actor I've never liked in anything, actually manages to avoid annoying me as the murderous and jealous Fred Diller. As for Shatner, well, he's probably at his most restrained here in a role requiring him to talk softly in oily tones. I got a kick out of the daughters. Both of them are so far over the top that you can't help but laugh at their antics. Be sure and keep an eye open for their dancing routine at the local veteran's get together. Is anyone as dense as these two airheads? Guess so. Thankfully, the performances unfold against the second important element that makes ""Big Bad Mama"" a lot of fun, namely the film's great atmosphere. While I imagine plenty of anachronisms plague the movie, I thought the 1930s props looked way better than I expected to see in a low budget picture. Finally, you really do get an opportunity to see Angie Dickinson take a few risks, so to speak, but you'll miss it if you blink. Considering what the actress had to do in the role, I'm surprised she took the part when she was still a player in Hollywood.

The DVD is standard a standard Roger Corman release. You get the obligatory short interview with Leonard Maltin, and a bunch of trailers. A sequel to ""Big Bad Mama,"" unoriginally entitled ""Big Bad Mama II,"" came out roughly ten years later. While I haven't seen the sequel, which apparently once again stars Angie Dickinson, I can say that the first film is a lot of fun. Great performances, bountiful skin, a sleazy attitude, and wonderfully realistic atmosphere makes this Corman classic a must see for B movie fans.",1093996800,35,5462,4.782838983050848

The girls played their  cute innocent sex kitten roles perfectly. All sorts of silly plot twists  appear so they can make out with guys, do a strip show, chase each other  around in their lingerie, and writhe in bed with more guys. Oh, and  incidentally, do the robberies and kidnappings necessary to maintain the  primary plot line.

Humorous in some  areas, serious in others this movie displays a wide variety of emotions as  it flows along. Each emothion falling well within the story line which can  be said to be a Bonnie & Clyde type. Angie Dickenson does a nice job of  acting but William Shatner seems a little ackward especially in the sex  scenes.

Smile and keep them to yourself.  The actors use stage names to protect their brand and fans need to respect that.

1011406,4,6305261326,"Like any red blooded American male, I'm quite taken with Angie Dickinson.  Since I first saw her in the shower in Dressed To Kill and wanted nothing more than to jump in with her and ask her if she needed help washing her back, I never missed a movie with her.
One of her most famous roles is as Wilma McClatchie in Corman's Big Bad Mama films.  In the first film she's a single mother raising two young girls in the 1930s.  With no money and a failed attempt at a bootlegging career, the trio take to a life of crime-robberies specifically.  They meet another bank robber(Tom Skerritt) and he joins them.  He really joins with Wilma.  Soon they meet a slimy gambler type(William Shatner), and Wilma, for some unknown reason, brings him into the ""family"", taking him as a lover as well!  Skerritt's not too crazy about this arrangement, and things get a bit creepy when he starts sleeping with both of Wilma's daughters!  Even impregnating one of them!  Soon the gang's crimes upgrade from robbery to kidnapping, and this proves to be Wilma's downfall.
Big Bad Mama is a very fun movie.  Not a flat out comedy and not very serious either.  Good performances all around(though the daughters are kinda irritating).  Corman once again squeezes every penny for what it's worth and gets a very professional look from a considerably low budget.
Big Bad Mama 2 was made thirteen years later, and Dickinson returns, obviously older(she was in her 40s in the first film I believe), but aged like a fine wine.  This time the two daughters are played by more sexy and airheaded types, which makes perfect sense considering this film was directed by none other than......Jim Wynorski!  And it definitely feels like a Wynorski film.  Here the trio(the pregnancy of the first film seems to be disregarded) are on a revenge mission.  Wilma's husband is killed by governor candidate, Crawford(the always fun Bruce Glover), so Wilma and the girls go back to robbery to support themselves, but now have a plan to ruin Crawford.  They kidnap his son, and naturally he falls in love with one of the daughters and becomes one of the gang.  Journalist Robert Culp(who's very good) is also along for the ride as he's after his big story and naturally smitten with Wilma.
A bit different in tone, but a very good sequel.
Extras here are commentaries on both films, an interview with Bruce Glover, and a documentary on the first film.  Well worth it.
Thanks again Shout! Factory.",1294531200,10,2454,4.704918032786885

1011409,3,6305261326,"Big Bad Mama is the archetypal Roger Corman 70s b-movie, with the monsters and sci-fi of the 50s and 60s replaced by plentiful low-budget action, tongue-in-cheek humor and mandatory nudity from almost every actress in the cast in a fast-moving Depression-era backroads gangster flick. Angie Dickinson is the Ma Barker figure tryin' to do right by her two gals, stumbling her way from bootlegging to armed robbery to kidnapping with the aid of Tom Skerritt's bank robber and William Shatner's Southern conman (unfortunately the mandatory nudity rule also applies to him, though we are spared the sight of the captain's log). While not as smart as John Sayles' and Jonathan Demme's Corman flicks there are occasional nods to history - not least the resistance of hypocritical establishment figures and the Big Rich to the New Deal, leaving the poor to fend for themselves as best they can - and some mildly anarchic sight gags (watch out for the cripple `healed' by William O'Connell's phoney preacher) but mostly this has few aspirations beyond throwing in as many shootouts, car chases and nude scenes from Ms Dickinson as it can in its 83 running time.",1200614400,6,1153,4.979274611398964

1011413,5,6305261326,"This movie is the perfect example of why Roger Corman's movies always made money:  good stories, beautiful women and action sequences that combined tension, speed and comedy.  Big Bad Mama is the story of one woman who wanted something better for her kids than what she had, and the lengths she would go to in order to achieve that.  Her resolution of the problem may not fit in with the better element's view of right and wrong, or propriety and morality, but then again, it was the society the better element carved out that had so imprisoned her and her family.  What other choice did she really have?  Angie Dickinson is fabulous as a woman who has seen clearly that the life she is leading is a dead end, and that the only recourse is to bust free.  Her daughters, taking their cue from mom, embrace the life of taking what you want, whether it is money, men or fast cars.  And, all three get plenty of all three.  What sets this movie apart from others of the same genre is that the sex, guns and fun are a realistic (an exaggerated reality yes, but then what is Angie Dickinson if not an exaggerated reality?) extrapolation of the story and not just a series of disjointed and pointless adventures.  It is a great ride with a great lady.",1178496000,2,1244,4.421052631578948

7887818,4,6305261326,"Well it's great and all you restored Big Bad Mama to widescreen and gave it more special features. It's really a pretty outrageous Bonnie and Clyde rip-off with Angie Dickinson and her two daughters committing various crimes and becoming involved with two other guys: William Shatner and Tom Skerritt. Shatner get's a chance to be hammy again as some kind of southern gentleman criminal, and gets to get down and naked in a sex scene with Dickinson. Pretty enjoyable movie all around. Also don't miss an early role from future Miami Vice star Michael ""Switek"" Talbott as the Sheriff's son.

The Sequel, well, not so much.  Jim Wynorski basically remakes the original from scratch. In fact I often wonder why they even bothered calling this a sequel. Considering a real sequel would pretty much be impossible knowing the downbeat ending we got dealt at the end of the first movie.
The sequel acts like nothing happen and continues just without the star power of Shatner or Skerritt.  Well you get Robert Culp and creepy Bruce Glover as replacements.  That and little Stephanie Mills from Archie Bunker's Place and All in the Family all grown up playing one of her daughters, which I guess was shocking when this was released considering she has a nude scene in it.

The sequel is really meh, Wynorski is a pretty wretched director of a lot of schlock and this is no exception. But it feels so much like a lame remake to the first movie. I'm surprised Corman didn't just say make it a remake. Maybe it's because Wynorski remade Not of this Earth the following year, not to mention the Wasp Woman in 1996.

In some ways, I wish they just had the first movie, because the sequel is so lackluster, hell Dickinson is so old for the part that in the sequel she apparently requested body doubles for her nude and sex scenes. Which is really noticeable.",1469577600,,1844,4.658461538461538
