1716779,5,B000067J0M,"this was the most genuinely unsettling film that i've seen in a hell of a long time, probably since ""suspiria"". it truly captures the feel of the lovecraft short stories that i've read,
more particularly ""shadow over innsmouth"" than its' namesake.
i think my head exploded when i saw it...it's one to own.",1028073600,,305,4.773584905660377
1716780,3,B000067J0M,"To those of you familiar with the books of H P Lovecraft this film should need little introduction.  That is apart from the need to know that the time frame of this film has been updated to our time which for all intents and purposes adds rather than detracts from the overall creepiness.  The plot can be found in the reviews below mine of which some stupidly give too much away which is strange for a forum like this that should be used to promote a cult film such as this otherwise we may not see its like again.  I mean lets face it, once you know major plot spoilers it does ruin a film and may stop potential purchasers.  Which would be a shame as originals in the field of cinema such as Stuart Gordon and Brian Yuzna should be allowed at least the grace of letting their movies be seen by as wide an audience as possible.  This film was the one they had waited years to make before finally getting the green light to produce as faithful an adaption of Lovecrafts work as possible.  And that is really all that needs to be said - if you love/like H P Lovecrafts work this is the nearest you will get to it on screen.  If you've never heard of him but like intelligent horror with a healthy side order of black humour and gore then you will appreciate this just as much.  Its just a pity that this film will sink without trace when put up against the redundant teen slasher flicks and pointless remakes/sequels of an already long dead genre.",1027814400,3,1447,4.274725274725275
1716781,2,B000067J0M,"Being a true Stuart Gordon fan, I have seen many of his previous films.  Gordon has always been fascinated by Lovecraft, as is apparent in his previous ventures, From Beyond and the truly excellent Re-Animator.  However, it seems that Gordon has fallen short upon his return to the Lovecraft era he so helped raise up.
  Dagon represents a film that tries so hard to be a good film, but is riddled with problems from start to finish.  Each actor in this film seems to be as uninteresting as the next.  Paul's history is crucial to the film's ending, but is just barely consolidated in the opening montage.  Paul's girlfriend falls into the cardboard role of strong female, only to obviously be taken away so our cowardly hero can emerge.
  I guess my main problem with the film lies in it's use of bad actors.  Paul can be decent, but falls into a sad spiral of the lost puppy dog face at the most inappropriate times.  Everyone else shows how painfully obvious that English is their second language.
  One of my biggest gripes deals with the finale.  The film had every opportunity to have a heroic entrance for Paul, like Herbert West in Re-Animator, but seemed to just throw him into the scene, leaving me feeling empty instead of the hope he was trying to convey.
  To be positive, i have to say that this film probably contains one of the goriest scenes of all time.  I won't give it away, but needless to say it is brutal.  I also found Paul's transformation to be a breath of fresh air, only to be ruined by the aforementioned lack of heroic entrance.",1027641600,,1558,4.503571428571429
1716782,4,B000067J0M,"This is one of the finer low-budget horror films I've seen. In fact, I'd say Dagon ranks with the better hooror films of any budget category. Having seen Hollywood mess up far too many horror films that had potential, it seems we needed a small time independent to show the rest how a horror movie ought to be made. I give four stars rather than five because I think the film could have been improved with added production values. Still, considering the budget, it's really very good. Now if someone will please take on some of Lovecraft's other gems in similar fashion...",1027641600,,572,4.617647058823529
1716783,5,B000067J0M,"What do you get when you mesh unblinking eyes, priests with webbed fingers and innkeepers with gilled throats, fishermen with a strange affinity for covering their faces, plenty of gold from the depths of the sea to go with the atypical ""bounty from the deep,"" a few faces getting peeled off to teach someone a lesson, a bit of octopi legging to replace those pesky bipedal ones, and one ancient tentacled God? No, it isn't your local barnyard sock-hop taking place at some yokel fairground, its Stuart Gordon's latest creation, the Lovecraft inspired Dagon!

Unlike many of Gordon's earlier, more goofy approaches to the horrific, this Shadows Over Innsmouth/Dagon recount wore a dark overcoat that shrouded almost all of the production. The tale begins with Paul (Ezra Godden) and his girlfriend Barbara, accompanied by two friends, as they toast the success of their new company off the coast of Spain. Paul finds himself plagued by dreams of the foulest sort, ones dealing with an underwater monument bearing a strange insignia and a half-fish/half-humanoid woman, the type that end with him awakening (once again) in a pool of sweat and screams. Soon after our introduction, a storm, if you can call the suddenly conceived, quickly overwhelming beast darkening the sky and tossing their boat around like a bath toy ""a storm,"" impales their boat upon a black reef that any Lovecraft fan will well appreciate. This, in turn, injures one of the boat's occupants and forces them to seek help in a decrepit fishing town called Imboca. As they approach the town in their cheaply construed rubber lifeboat their woes begin, with the sound of gunfire coming from the ship and something brushing against their raft and knocking a hole in it. Is this sign of something to come? Well, in a world where the beasts run rampant in the water, you bet it is. The two quickly find themselves in a town that first seems deserted, a place where the churches read ""Esoterica Orde De Dagon"" and the occupants, once they are finally found, seem to grow odder and odder by the minute. All these things come together and finally lead them toward secrets that no Bostonian before them ever really wanted to learn, the truth behind the worshippers of Dagon.

  Touting nice effects in the monster category, some decent acting (Godden reminding me a lot of Jeffrey Combs, a great thing in my book), pieces of comedy to go with the more horrific, Deep One inspired portions of the movie, and some nice looking DVD quality, this is something to pick up and watch a few time. I highly recommend it for those who've always wanted augmentation by making deals with the oddities of underwater worship or for those simply wanting to stroll the beaches of human suffering as casual passerbys. It'll give you more reasons than the mere shark to stay away from the ocean.",1026691200,40,2839,4.823408624229979
1716784,4,B000067J0M,"I got lucky and saw this movie at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, a theater that playes cult movies, and this is definately an instant cult classic. The story is about four people who are shipwreked outside a small coastal town. What follows is in truly Lovecraftian. The movie is a little low budget, but makes up for it with creepines and wit. Overall, this movie will be an instant favorite among H.P. Lovecraft fanatics, but does have a few flaws. Most of the dialogue by older Spanish actor is unintelligable. The main character is not immediately likeable, but soon evolves into an Ash/Crawford character. The two friends in the boat could have been dealt with a little more grisly. Aside from these minor points, this is a fun movie with one of the greatest death scenes ever.",1025913600,2,783,4.681159420289855
1716785,3,B000067J0M,"I just saw a theatrical screening of this little opus (thanks to a local theatre; this is the kind of nifty little horror movie that no Hollywood studio would have a clue what to do with) and thought it was among Gordon's better films. Gordon's first two Lovecraft movies are more pastiches of HPL than actual adaptations. Re-Animator and From Beyond are horror camp classics but bear little resemblance to their original stories. Gordon's next HPL effort, Castle Freak, was, I thought, a failure; an attempt to adapt ""The Outsider,"" it seemed as if Gordon wasn't nearly as confident trying to do Lovecraft seriously as he was doing spoofs. But Dagon is much more successful as serious HPL. Adapted from two stories, ""Dagon"" and ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth,"" Dagon was shot in Spain on a $3 million budget, and Gordon got some good bang for his buck over there. The production design is suitably dark and creepy, and this is the first HPL movie that really communicates Lovecraft's terrified obsession with the ocean, which he turned into the realm of the Deep Ones. The script details the ordeal of two couples whose boat runs aground on some rocks near a remote Spanish seacoast town (Gordon's decision to stick with the Spanish location and not try to fake New England works surprisingly well); rowing into town for help, they are almost immediately set upon by the grotesque, shambling locals, all of whom are worshippers of the sea god Dagon and are afflcited with the curse of the Deep Ones. Gore-hounds will appreciate the face-skinning scene. The movies flaws include a weak American leading actor whose high-pitched whiny voice doesn't exactly lend authority when he brandishes a knife and shouts ""Come on, m--f--!"" It seems as if Gordon was looking for a guy with a Jeffrey Combs quality and just got an annoying little mouse. Some of the Spanish actors stumble over their accents as well. And while the effects are generally fine for the budget, a couple of key CGI shots look bogus. Still, this movie is entertaining to watch on its own modest terms, and ought to provide inspiration to up-and-coming filmmakers on what can be done on little money (even if you have to go to Europe to raise it). As for the DVD, I don't know yet whether or not it will be widescreen (as it says here) or full-frame (as it says at [another DVD store]). I saw it projected at roughly 1.78:1 and I hope the DVD retains that aspect ratio for 16:9 monitors.",1025308800,7,2446,4.7172897196261685

The movie was plodding, almost a chore to get through, with a massive amount of exposition for the amount of real story. It might have been better to leave some aspects as more of a mystery than to excruciatingly drag the audience through the background of the town.

1716928,4,B000067J0M,"Excellent adaptation of classic Lovecraft. Some have said the movie is even better than the story. That's probably true, as Lovecraft's writing can be tedious, whereas it's his vision of horror that is exceptional. While there are some gory moments which I think mar the film (thus only 3 stars), the rest of the film has an art film quality to it. Low budget. Cutting edge in terms of dramatic use of resources.

1716931,3,B000067J0M,"After playing the commentary by Director Robert Gordon DAGON can be viewed with a tad more clarity and a bit more of the film-making process to warrant closer to a 4 star rating.  But I marked three stars because I still like Gordon's Lovecraft adaptations of Re-Animator as well as From Beyond better.  I gave those 2 movies strong 4 star ratings.  They are simply more fun!  And gorier.  And the nudity was more controversial and, somehow, less gratuitous  (I guess I missed Barbara Crampton too).

But, what made DAGON (2002) worth the watch was the location filming of old fishing village that really was/is Spain.
I also liked the use of DAGON in the Lovecraft story The Shadow Over Innsmouth which Gordon admits DAGON is really based on.  The Dagon story is only 5 pages and borrows the boat crash and the black smut rising from the depths of the ocean...

But, the buildup to the movie's conclusion eventually becomes graphic in blood and nudity (a nice frontal during 'ceremony' -- it is comparable to a Barbara Crampton ""exploited"" scene(s)...) but, it occurs without the campy edge or fun ... it is quite serious.
The village infestation is not zombie-like which is a ""different look"" and a plus for me.  There is an ""indigenous"" to the sea and village bedroom scene with Ezra Gooden that is memorable.  Whoa! Indeed!
The finale is from the Lovecraft story, but, I must say, done in a more productive movie manner to give this H.P Lovecraft adaptation a true ""Horror"" movie lift.  You might wonder if the DAGON ending is a pathetic one, laughable, or a happy(?) one.  All of the above?  All good reactions from a horror movie?  sure.
And, for what it's worth, after watching these Gordon directed Lovecraft adaptations of varying style, I have finally read a few H.P's rather literary stories.

1717012,4,B000067J0M,"A quick note before the review: Keep in mind that H.P. Lovecraft started writing THIS kind of material in the early 1920's. Simply
Unbelievable. I bet he really freaked some people out!
  H.P. Lovecraft's work was so far ahead of its time that it boggles the mind. Lovecraft was unfortunately already long deceased before his material got its time in the spotlight. I read all of Lovecraft's stories, and this movie DAGON sticks right with the Shadow Over Innsmouth. But he also wrote a story entitled Dagon as well. His stories often overlapped in a lot of ways. Maybe he was intending to put all of his work into a sort of master story. The reason his work was kind of ""scattered"" (I believe) is becuase his attempts to bring horror to the masses did not gain traction until much, much, later. The depth of his work is still seen today. Lovecraft thought up the whole Cthulua mythos and the works surrounding ""The Old Ones.""  His work was so powerful that the people of His time probably thought He was nuts or the devil himself! But in fact, in our present time, there are STILL remnants of his genius. For instance, Lovecraft wrote the gripping story of the Mad Arab, Al Azif, and his writing of the Necrocomicon. (Please excuse the spelling, it's been awhile since I read Lovecraft, and my spell check has to go and have a nice lie down when I put two consonants together) Anyway, the myth of a REAL ""Book Of The Dead"" out there, somewhere, is still being contested. Some people refuse to believe that the world Lovecraft created was truly just a story written by a man at all. Some of his stories were short, some were longer, some were a mixed material and written in a completely different way. If you've not read Lovecraft, you are missing out on stories that would have put him right up there with King, Koontz, Clive Barker, and other masters of horror and things that go ""bump in the night"". Watch this vid. It's a little on the B-ish side, but sticks with the stories that Lovecraft wrote nearly a century ago.",1468713600,9,2023,4.521857923497268

1717075,4,B000067J0M,"A few months ago I met Stuart Gordon at a showing of his film RE-ANIMATOR at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood. I enjoy horror movies, but don't generally care for gory ones, and not being all that up on directors I had never heard of Gordon. I was impressed by his calm, confident, earthy manner and the funny anecdotes about shooting RE-ANIMATOR on a rushed schedule and a very low budget. When I got home I looked up his films and, since I was also curious about Lovecraft's work, decided on DAGON. I'm glad I did. This is a surprisingly effective and atmospheric horror movie that knows when to hold back...and when to slap you silly.

The story begins on a boat off the coast of rural Spain. A stock market tycoon named Paul Marsh (Ezra Godden, evidently chosen for his resemblance to Jeffrey Combs) is vacationing with his hot Spanish girlfriend Barbara (Raquel Merono) and their friends Vicki and Howard. Paul has been having weird dreams set underwater and featuring a mysterious but terrifying girl, which distract him and cause him to quarrel with Barbara. A sudden storm drives their boat onto some rocks and injures Vicki, forcing Paul and Barbara to head inland for help. Arriving at the desolate, run-down, storm-swept town of Imboca, they part ways and both rapidly discover that the inhabitants of the town are fishy...literally. Barbara is kidnapped by a mysterious priest (Ferran Lahoz) while Paul escapes a mob of what appear to be only partially human townspeople and encounters an old drunk named Ezequiel (Fransisco Rabaul). Ezequiel, the town's only completely human resident, knows the grisly secret behind the transformations of the townsfolk from peaceable, churchgoing fisherman into monsters who skin outsiders alive and perform gruesome sacrifices to appease a mysterious ocean god: but Paul is more interested in finding his lady love and getting away. When he encounters...literally...the girl of his dreams in town, however, he begins to wonder whether Barbara or the strange, half-human Uxia (Macarena Gomez) is the woman is where his final destiny lies.

DAGON is an unorthodox film. The cast is small, the decayed, doomed, dark-and-stormy night atmosphere is right out of a Resident Evil video game, and it relies very heavily on innuendo and setup rather than gore for its scares...until it doesn't, whereupon it delivers some of the most gruesome moments I've ever seen in a horror film: a man literally flayed alive as he quotes scripture. The CGI is not very good, but is mercifully restrained in favor of solid practical effects in low lighting. Ezra Godden is engaging as the befuddled nerd-hero, though sometimes he seems unsure in what gear he needs to be operating as an actor (this movie doesn't have as much over-the-top black humor as, say, RE-ANIMATOR but there are doses of laughs, some of which aren't really appropriate for the general tenor of the picture). Ferran Lahoz is appropriately loathsome as the evil priest, and both Raquel M. and Macarena G. deliver the goods as love interests on opposite poles of personality -- and humanity. However, the real scene-stealer is the late Fransisco Rabaul, who delivers a memorable and moving performance as the broken-down old drunk who pays an awful price for a sudden burst of late-movie heroism. I believe Rabaul died shortly after production and so this was his last film: if so it was a fitting send-off to a fine actor. The ending of the movie is at once tragic and oddly satisfying, and left me with a feeling that I had found a jewel -- or rather a pearl -- in the ocean of crappy low-budget horror films you find on Netflix and Prime. The best horror generally boils down to ""likable people in a bad situation"" and that most definitely qualifies here. If you've never seen a Stuart Gordon movie, this isn't a bad place to start, and if you're already a fan, you'll definitely want to check out DAGON.",1448668800,6,3906,4.881024096385542

The sense of dread is nicely built up without being overdone, as much as is possible with such extreme visual imagery.

This setting, however, is quite visually arresting and it's no loss to us the viewer. Despite the title, it is actually based on Shadow out of Innsmouth, a short story about a seaside town of questionable character.

The movie follows the plot of the book fairly closely, but with some additions, most notably a local female seductress character who certainly never would have appeared in Lovecraft's male-dominated writings and a few scenes of nudity, both characteristic of Stuart Gordon adaptations. Tension is built effectively, and the horror comes from imagining what's in the dark spaces rather than from seeing things jump out of them. The effects are hit or miss; some of the makeup is effectively creepy, but a dose of CGI at the end regrettably cheapens the film.

The DVD does offer two commentary tracks about the story and the production. Overall, it's worth checking out for a fan of intellectual horror. Go in with expectations as low (like the budget), and you'll come away satisfied.",1394841600,,1125,4.9787234042553195

1717300,5,B000067J0M,"First of all, Thank You, to Stuart Gordon & company for making an excellent film. This is beautiful film making & story telling hands down! It is the most ""Lovecraftian"" film I have ever witnessed. There are so many wonderful things about this film. One thing I noticed that was very subtle was how they hid one of the clues that was present during the entire tale. Our reluctant hero Paul complains of an ulcer at the start of the show and grabs his stomach throughout the movie. Because his character is portrayed very believably in terms of his injuries: throughout the movie after he is injured he continues to: limp, groan, grab his shoulder, etc...., we don't notice him grabbing his stomach as much as we would have, and consequently we don't guess the ending as easily as we would have-Well done! On a side note Dagon is a name from the Old Testament, which Gordon mentions on his commentary. Dagon in the Bible is a man-fish god worshipped by the Philistines. In one particularly humorous Bible story found in I Samuel Chpt5 VS 1-5: the Philistines steal the Ark of the Covenant from Israel. They place it in their temple where they have a statue of their man-fish god Dagon. The next day when the Philistines go into their temple they see the statue is prostrate-bowing down towards the Ark of the Covenant. They proceed to set the statue back up right. The next day the go back to their temple and God has made the image of Dagon bow down once again, this time it's head and hands are broken off as well, and only the body remain!

1717303,4,B000067J0M,"Like Kurosawa's ""Rashomon"" (which is actually based on another novella ""In a Grove""), the story of ""Dagon"" is in fact closer to that of ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" though the original's plotline about a hapless traveler is considerably changed. Loosely based on two H.P. Lovecraft works, a 2001 Spanish horror film may disappoint the author's fans, but as a slick B-horror flick ""Dagon"" manages to deliver the goods.

Directed by Stuart Gordon of ""Re-Animator"" fame, the story of ""Dagon"" revolves around a young billionaire Paul Marsh (Ezra Godden) having a vacation with his girlfriend Barbara (Raquel Meroo) in Spain on their friend's boat. When a storm arrives, they head for a nearby seaside village ""Imboca,"" where he is attacked by a group of strange-looking residents.

Set in modern-day Spain, this is not a very faithful Lovecraft adaptation, but still is a surprisingly enjoyable ride. Acting is at best so-so, though I found Macarena Gmez's ""dream girl"" pretty impressive. Also, I wanted to see more people with the ""Innsmouth look,"" and was not much impressed with the protagonist's one-liners, but except the weak (and thankfully brief) introduction, the film maintains the creepy atmosphere.

""Dagon"" is a decent horror movie that is entertaining, but also makes us want to see a more authentic version of ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" set in Massachusetts, and hopefully with a bus.",1373500800,,1395,5.191111111111111
1717304,4,B000067J0M,"Yes, I know the title is Dagon, but the title should really be Shadow Over Innsmouth which is really what the movie is based on.  It has everything Lovecraft had issues with, interest in ancient ruins, his fear of sea life, the worship of alien creatures, cross-breeding, sex, race, horror, the unknown.  All the building blocks are there.  The town is a wonderful landscape of decay, ruin, and depression.  I am surprised we don't see dead bodies hanging from ropes.  Well, we kind of do.  The acting is supreme - the local actors were some of the best known in Spain, and the main male character, the American Dot Com Hero is in fact played by a English actor I believe and well played too.  He plays the Hero to the hilt.  In other words, a glass wearing, yellow bellied, person who can't seem to do anything right and is in denial a lot of the time.  Brilliant!
The actors and actresses are all wonderful, the atmosphere is dark, wet, and very much a place nobody wants to visit, and the computer effects are, sad to say, somewhat cheap.  But luckily the computer effects are also light - this story is fueled by characters and settings and story.  The make-up on the other hand is very well done, no doubt aided by the fact that the scenes are dark and rain filled.
There are a few plot holes, such as the hot wiring of the car which seems to work later, but outside of that it is a very well made movie, with a few scenes that many people will find unsettling or outright gross.  But that's horror.
You may have noticed a bunch of negative reviews.  Many of them seem to hammer the same points - all two or three of them. And most, to be honest, seem to be raves or fish puns.  I red many of them before getting the movie and can only say, from my point of view, remember, that they don't know anything of the story the movie is based on or of Lovecraft.  One person complained, for example, about how the Hero escaped the fish-people in the hotel with his knife.  Which is funny, because that WAS right out of the story.  You will notice also that few of them have impressed anybody as the negative reviews seem to have a lot of votes against them.  In fact I think they do a good job of supporting this film as much as the good reviews do, as the negative reviews have to try very hard to shoot holes in it.  And what few REAL complaints they have, the ones with any weight, are the same.
In the end if you love horror, atmosphere, and Lovecraft I would suggest taking a look at this film.  If you are wary may I suggest renting it or getting it out of a library?",1367971200,2,2571,4.240246406570842

1717307,4,B000067J0M,"Director Stuart Gordon (The Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dolls) is no stranger to H. P. Lovecraft and I think he really nailed this one.  This is a B-movie, and it shows, but it's a great one.

After a yachting accident in a storm, the affluent Paul (Ezra Godden) and his girlfriend Barbara (Raquel Meroo; Beneath Still Waters) find themselves on the shore of a rundown fishing village off the coast of Spain.

Finding the city nearly barren, they take shelter from the storm in the Church of Dagon which bears a strange symbol which Paul has seen in his dreams.  The people of the town are all quite odd.  A priest (Ferran Lahoz; Darkness, Faust) of the Church of Dagon has webbed hands, the hotel manager has gills and never blinks, and many of the people are stunningly pale, ranging from deathly anemic to even albino. We very quickly discover that this town and its people are under the influence of an ancient Cthulu sea god and its monstrous half-human offspring.

Separated from Barbara early in the movie, our protagonist Paul strikes me as the first person to die in a typical horror movie.  True to Lovecraftian form, he is weak, pale, neurotic, desperate and scared.  That said, Paul is perhaps the most credibly pathetic horror protagonist out there.  However, unlike The Re-Animator and From Beyond, this movie takes itself quite seriously.  The Re-Animator and From Beyond reach such outrageous levels of ridiculousness that they start to feel cartoonishly crazy, whereas Dagon is focused and never farcical--but quite ""out there.""

As Paul searches for Barbara we learn more about the village's history with Dagon and find intriguing connections linking Paul to the village itself.  It's pretty elaborate and inventive for a direct-to-DVD movie... even for any horror movie.

This movie features a lot of crappy CGI that you'd expect from a Sci-Fi channel movie-of-the-week.  The gore is infrequent, but there is a seriously grotesque skin-peeling scene that should impress any gorehound.

Director Stuart Gordon (The Re-Animator, From Beyond, Dolls) is no stranger to H. P. Lovecraft and I think he really nailed this one.

1717332,4,B000067J0M,"I was pleased with the purchase of this movie. My husband and I are both Lovecraft fans and are on the look out for good movie adaptations of the stories. The movie has some of the elements of the 'Shadow Over Innsmouth' story with modern adaptations (I have never read the Father Dagon story so I don't know if any of that was in it too). Though the plot had been added upon it didn't feel too un-Lovecraftian. We were both pretty happy that the writers didn't turn Cthuhlu or any of the Elder Gods into 'Satan' as they have in other film adaptations of Lovecraftian stories.

Yeah, some of the special effects aren't cutting edge (keep in mind this movie is 10 years old) and yes I agree with some of the other comments that the main character is really whiny. There were a few times in the movie we both laughed about the main character because we said 'that would never work' and it backfired on him. Overall I'd say for the time and budget the special effects were pretty decent (more like a B+ movie than a B). I was definitely impressed and creeped out by the overall feel of the town and the Deep Ones. I felt drawn into the suspense and mystery of the movie. The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 was because I thought they could have stayed a little more true to the Cthuhlu Myoths than they could have made the main character a little more compelling while still making him nerdy.",1326499200,,1407,4.309433962264151
1717333,5,B000067J0M,"*** Major Spoiler Alert ***

Stuart Gordon's Dagon is an intense  and unique film based mostly on H.P. Lovecraft's The Shadow Over Innsmouth and his much shorter work entitled Dagon. This is really epic material in a strangely soaked Spanish environment. A Lovecraftian cult worshiping the underwater deity Dagon have taken over a small town on the Atlantic coast of Spain. A sailboat on pleasure cruise ends wrecked there. They will not be leaving anytime soon.

Now situationally this is a fairly obvious menu. Gordon does, at one point, dive off the gory edge, but this is a Stuart Gordon film after all. Meanwhile the chase through dripping dampness of the town is really a pulse quickener. What makes this work is the danker than dank waterlogged environment and the extraordinarily emotional relationship of Dagon's daughter played in a one of a kind performance by Spanish actress Macarena Gomez to our trapped nerd, played by Ezra Godden.

Macarena plays the part of tentacled siren princess with real fish-eyed believability. She was given instructions by Gordon (whose previous Lovecraft works include From Beyond and Re-Animator) to keep her eyes from blinking. When in the end Uxa (Gomez) craves Paul (Godden), whom she calls Pablo, she calls out to him with such an urgent imploring sad doomed yet loving tone in her voice she becomes perhaps the ultimate mermaid nightmare: Her eyes filled with wells of tearful salt water, her robes of gilded Symbolist splendor. She reveals the dark secrets of the unholy sect.

Uxa: Pablo, it is your destiny... We had different mothers, but the same father... We are children of Dagon. Your dreams. Remember your dreams, Pablo. They brought you here.
Paul: No. They were nightmares. They weren't real.
Uxa: Every dream is a wish.
Paul: Somebody help me! What's happening to me?
Uxa: You are my brother. You will be my lover - forever.

The tone Macarena hits here is the crescendo of the entire film, that sense of hopeless beauty and tragic certainty. I don't agree philosophically with the fatalism of that black romance, but who hasn't felt that temptation to give into it. And as Paul sets himself on fire and plunges into the sea Uxa follows. And together they descend into the depths of the tentacled God Dagon's realm. One feels the drowning, yet liberation. Yet we know to follow is to be annihilated.

I can't think of another film to present the darker aesthetics aspects of the antique Symbolist dream so vividly. For those with strong stomachs yet sensitive hearts I strongly recommend Dagon.",1322438400,4,2555,4.941724941724941

Lovecraft's works are particularly difficult to capture on film (considering the unknowable, madness-inducing horror involved), but Stuart Gordon has surpassed the majority of Lovecraftian filmmakers with this one.  Also, of significant note on this DVD are the commentaries.  I almost never listen to commentaries but *both* the commentaries on this disc are incredibly interesting and insightful.  After you've watched it a couple of times, be sure to go through them both.

The pictures on the box (and many of those supplied here) simply don't do the film justice.  I was doubtful but I'm glad I gave this one a chance.

The story comes from a combination of two of H.P. Lovecraft's stories: Dagon and The Shadow Over Innsmouth.  It couldn't have been done more perfectly.  It's truer to the original text than the vast majority of Lovecraftian modernizations.

The main actor adds just the right - if brief - element of understated comedy to this otherwise terrifying film.  It is incredibly challenging to add an undertone of comedy to a horror film that doesn't come off as cheesy, but not so here.",1313366400,,1220,5.080402010050252

1717339,5,B000067J0M,"This is Stuart Gordon at his absolute best, taking a minuscule budget and producing an outstanding and surreal world out of it. DAGON is a Lovecraft adaptation involving a couple whose boat is marooned on a mysterious island inhabited by strange malformed hedonists that worship Dagon, a god of the sea. The denizens of the town don't take kindly to intruders, and the couple battle to survive against the half-men / half-fish. The setting of Imboca is amazing, setting a brooding mood and atmosphere in a ramshackle town that lives under a never-ending rain cloud. Gordon incorporates deep blue tones and filters along with the constant use of water, which emphasize the importance of the ocean in the film. To reduce costs, the movie was filmed in Spain, with a predominantly Spanish cast, which gives it an authentic and unsettling feeling as compared to a town of Americans with terrible Spanish accents. On top of everything else, the FX work in the film is stunning, offering an amalgamation of different fishmen ranging from subtle webbed fingers to a woman with octopus tentacles for legs to various incarnations in between. The mobs that chase the couple make chilling calls similar to those of the velocoraptors in JURASSIC PARK as they hunt their prey, which combined with the dark setting and claustrophobic alley ways of the town makes for suspenseful and frightening chase sequences. Ezra Godden also plays a lovable geek, and though he isn't the best actor, he is excellent in the role and lends credibility to the situation. I hate to compare it to a video game, but Dagon offers the look and feel of RESIDENT EVIL 4 in a tight script and beautiful setting.

1717394,5,B000067J0M,"Dagon: 9 out of 10: Early on in his novella Mountains of Madness;H.P. Lovecraft paints the following picture ""On and around that laboratory table were strown (sic) other things, and it did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog"".

I bring this quote up because so many who are casually equated with the Lovecraftian genre naturally assume he wouldn't approve of the sex and violence portrayed in modern film versions of his work. He of course had to work within the mores of the day as he sought to get his works published in magazines often read by children. Graphic sex and violence was no more acceptable in the popular fiction of the 1920's and 30's than it was in the movies of the same time period. He however often pushed the boundaries of the time and though Victorian by both birth and nature he creatively expanded what was acceptable.

Dagon is a movie filled with nudity and very graphic violence. It is also simply the best Lovecraft adaptation ever. A combination of the title work and 'The Shadow Over Innsmouth', Dagon creates a phenomenal atmosphere and doesn't let up. The tension is palatable for almost the entire running time till the grand finale (which I'll admit was a little to much Lair of the White Worm for my tastes).

The make up and special effects are wonderful(with the exception one bad blink and you miss it CGI effect). The actors (at least the ones that are intelligible) do a fine job. But it is the incredible foreboding atmosphere that propels the movie along.

Filmed on a low budget they apparently found a remarkably frightening real life city that didn't need a lot of dressing up. Add a cast of stranger and stranger ""creatures"" and you simply have a winner. If you are unfamiliar with the Lovecraftian canon this is a great B movie.

1717419,4,B000067J0M,"(This is a slightly edited version of my DAGON review which previously appeared on the TONMO site under another username.)

A man dreams of diving through undersea ruins where a beautiful mermaid beckons; as they embrace, she opens her mouth to reveal the knifelike teeth of a predator. A severely wounded woman is trapped in a sinking boat; as a ribbon of her blood curls downwards into the sea, a huge cloud of black ink billows upwards ominously to meet it. These disturbing images are only hints of the horrors to come in DAGON, a film based upon two Cthulhu Mythos stories by H.P. Lovecraft -- ""Dagon"" and ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"", as adapted by Stuart Gordon (who had years ago filmed a version of HPL's ""Herbert West, Reanimator"" under the title of RE-ANIMATOR).

Actually, the title DAGON is misleading. The story ""Dagon"" -- one of HPL's shorter and less notable works -- has little to do with the film except for the reference to the shipwreck and the eponymous Philistine fish-god. DAGON the film is actually an updated version of HPL's brilliant, vividly written novella ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"", transplanted by Gordon from a Massachusetts seaport town to a fishing village on Spain's Galician coast. The name which Gordon gives the village, Imboca, is an inexact Spanish translation of the name Innsmouth. The original story was told in the first person, by a solitary male traveler to Innsmouth; Gordon has added an additional man and some women to the plotline, though most of the film is from the POV of ""Paul"", the shipwrecked young Spanish-American stockbroker (equivalent to HPL's traveler) who finds himself stranded in Imboca, among people who are not quite.... people.

The first thing that impressed me about this film was its relative faithfulness to the original story. I say ""relative"" because -- in addition to the shift of time and place -- there were many Hollywoodish embellishments, obvious (and successful) attempts to get that coveted R rating. As horrific as HPL's stories were, the ultimate horror was always implied -- left to the imagination of the reader -- which made it that much more effective as compared with the almost unwatchable gore towards the end of DAGON. In addition, the Gentleman from Providence was ever the old-fashioned prude, to whom S-E-X was a four-letter word. He would've been appalled at the gratuitous female nudity and expletive-laden dialogue in DAGON -- indeed, there was no vulgar language in his stories, and hardly any women at all (the few that were, were not the sort one would want to see nude!). Gordon also added an element of dark humor to some of the scenes, and even threw in a touch of STAR WARS with a Jerry Springer twist!

That being said.... DAGON captured the atmosphere of HPL's story to perfection. The brooding, rainy skies, the narrow streets, the nauseatingly shabby rooms, the desecrated former church, the shadowy figures hobbling down alleys making guttural inhuman sounds, and most especially the ""Innsmouth look"" -- or, in this case, the ""Imboca look"" -- of the villagers, all were done with loving detail by the director, set designers, and makeup artists. Nearly everything about the story was as I'd visualized while reading it, including the not-so-crazy town drunk played masterfully by distinguished Spanish actor Francisco Rabal (who unfortunately passed away after the filming of DAGON). Former unknown Ezra Godden, who is in nearly every scene, gives a harrowing, convincing performance as protagonist Paul. And Macarena Gomez -- yes, that's her name! -- in the role of Uxia deserves the Morticia Addams award for being beautiful, sexy, and creepy at the same time. Even the musical score was haunting and atmospheric, a refreshing change from the usual recycled rock songs used in some modern ""slice and dice"" flicks.

And, of course, there's squiddage galore! Though only hinted at in that initial shipwreck scene, tentacles later begin to show up in the darnedest places: shooting out of a mouth; in place of arms; in place of legs; and in the climactic ""sacrifice"" scene, exploding horrifically out of the abyss. There is even a possible cinematic first -- a real live (as opposed to cartoon) ""mer-squid"", thanks to some top-notch special effects.

Other makeup effects are equally impressive, like the ""Imboca look"" in all its stages, from an eerie fish-like stare to the complete, hideous transformation. There's also a ""skinning"" scene so realistic that the only way I could watch it was by repeating to myself, ""It's only a special effect, it's only a special effect....""!

There are some drawbacks to DAGON besides the ones mentioned above. Much of the dialogue is in Spanish without subtitles -- I had to rely on my rudimentary college Spanish, combined with prior knowledge of the story, to figure out what was being said. But a viewer without either advantage might be extremely confused. Therefore, I strongly recommend reading ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" before seeing this film (I'd recommend reading it anyway -- it is one of HPL's best works). Also, I had a problem with the nudity. Not out of prudishness, but because of the old Hollywood double standard -- ever notice how male human sacrifices never have to take their pants off? If Gordon had wanted to be faithful to the story, no nudity would've been necessary. But since he envisioned a more graphic fertility ritual, he should've extended that vision to both sexes. In addition, I became rather impatient at the very beginning of the film, where much time was wasted in pointless dialogue between Paul and his girlfriend on the boat. I can understand Gordon's desire to build up the horror slowly -- which he did quite successfully -- rather than inundate the viewer with scary stuff immediately. But the initial dialogue should've been relevant to the story line, or at very least interesting, rather than an annoying, petulant lovers' quarrel just to kill time. And as a cephalofan, I would've liked to see even more tentacled beings, and to have caught a longer, closer glimpse of the squid-god himself.

Nevertheless, DAGON is to date the most accurate cinematic adaptation of a Lovecraft story I've seen. I watched it on VHS, and from what I understand the DVD is even better because of its additional material (interviews, background, etc.). I give DAGON a solid four-star rating, and will close this review as Stuart Gordon did the film, quoting the final lines of HPL's story ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"":

""We shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses.... and in that lair of the Deep Ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory for ever.""",1210377600,5,6672,4.9659803043867505

1717422,4,B000067J0M,"Paul Marsh, his girlfriend Barbara, and another couple {one of whom doesn't make it} are shipwrecked by a mysterious storm, becoming stranded in a dank Spanish town named ""Imboca"" {what would have been ""Innsmouth""}, populated by transmutating barely human amphibious creatures.

When his companions disappear, he learns the truth of this place from ""Ezequiel"", an elderly vagrant who relates that the strange occupants are actually cultists who worship the Cthulhu-like Dagon, and have long since turned the local Catholic Church {whose then-resident priest was slain} into one of this sea god. This yields to highly dramatic scenes of transition featuring a High Priest taking control of the town. Their emblem resembles a subaqueous ""all-seeing eye"" which replaces smashed christian icons.

Marsh is pursued by the tentacle-limbed zombie-like inhabitants through one suspenseful situation to the next, where he eventually discovers human skin hanging from hooks, other mutant creatures, and a really enchantingly beautiful mermaid named Uxia {the delicious Macarena Gomez} pining for his amorous attention. Throughout this tale, it seems he had oneiromantically forseen glimpses of this entire adventure in his dreams, from the alien symbols to this beauty.

He, Barbara, and Ezequiel eventually find themselves about to be sacrificed to the hungry Dagon, until Marsh is rescued by this superb mermaid, who desires him for her own. Turns out Uxia is the High Priestess, attired in glorious ceremonial vestments, lifting an impressive spinal dagger, uttering the invocation ""IA! IA! Cthulhu F'Thag'n"" phrase ubiquitous in the Lovecraftian mythos. At the ceremony, the black robed High Priest comes forth, who has since evolved into the personification of Cthulhu with an octopus head and tentacles about the mouth.

Ezequiel is killed, and Barbara is lowered into a well-like pit to feed the aquatic beast. In the end, despite the self-immolation of Marsh, the Dagonites actually prevail, as he essentially sheds his skin to join the sublime Uxia when he realizes he is actually one of them.

Those who appreciate the works of 'The Old Gent', will like this one. Beginning in a lightmare, Dagon concludes in a nightmarish purging of perception. With minimal gore, some brief CGI, and gloomy environments, this is a thrilling, and very dark film with a refreshing twist, sans the typical duality and plot outcome common in most cult / monster movies, where the protagonist  was formally his own antagonist, who experiences realization and acceptance of his true nature.",1199577600,2,2569,5.41

How fishy!(Pun Intended)  Not to mention his mother being corrupted and impregnated by their freakish leader!(EEEWWW!) Thus bringing to this world both the mermaid chick and Paul!  To make matters even worse the homeless man Ezequiel who knew all about the evil Dagon worshipping cult and their rise to power gets skinned alive!(How ironic is that a fish skinning a human being!) So Paul jumps into action having successfully killed three of the fish people he then wants to naturally save his girlfriend Barbara. So supposedly Barbara was to be sacrificed to their octopus god Dagon to be impregnated with what I guess was suppossed to be a successor or something!

Well then his sister knocked him and herself into the water as he changes!(DUMB!)  Worst of all is the way that the hero losing and the bad guys winning is seriously and despicably made light of!  Other than that that mute hotel clerk was both creepy and annoying and in general I don't undertstand why anyone would want to make like Henry Limpet and become a fish in the first place!!!

However, I've found Stuart Gordon's adaptations to be both entertaining and thrilling, even though the stories aren't exact Lovecraft yarns. DAGON is fittingly bleak, with an immediate sense of dreadful doom! The Dagonian offspring are slimey, wobbly, octopoid critters, perfectly matching the overall greyness of their dead village. Imboca itself is dank, barren, and totally uninviting. Paul (Ezra Godden) is the ordinary guy, thrust headlong into this squirming pit of eels! Barbara (Raquel Merono) is Paul's beautiful girlfriend, who disappears before we can even get used to her! Horror is everywhere, as Paul tries to find Barbara and save his own soul. DAGON succeeds in being a horrific plunge into darkness and nightmare, just like HPL's more chilling stories. No, the CGI isn't top-notch, but I can overlook this small problem in an otherwise satisfying film.

Where did the tentacles come from?  Dagon was supposed to be some kind of fish god or at least that's what I understood.

The scenes in the streets of Innsmouth - or Inboca as it is called here - were terrific, with the shambling half-seen figures in the rain. And the film-makers didn't wimp out with the ending - they basically went with HPL's ending, with Paul Marsh accepting his fate as one of the ""children of Dagon"".

I think it reflects Lovecraft imagery with uncanny authenticity. The actress who plays an oddly appealing anti-heroine gothic horror is a lot of fun to watch. DAGON will keep you rivited, or at least very interested.

Unfortunately, the side-effect of three generations of devotion is that they're all mutating into sea creatures and have a tendency to wear the faces of those stray humans who stumble across them and get skinned alive or mated with Dagon for their troubles... It may sound cheesy, but while it's not particularly frightening it's played with a commendable straight face and plenty of atmosphere. It's just a shame the writers got a little too obsessive about having the hero talking about binary systems.

Lovecraft have yet to see a faithful adaptation.  And though his profound influence on horror film can be seen in works as disparate as ""Alien"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" there has yet to be, to my knowledge, a single _decent_ interpretation.  It seems that Lovecraft's name is destined to be affixed to derivative crap of one kind or another; if it isn't a well intended disappointment like ""The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath,"" it's crap like ""Cthulhu Mansion.""

Unfortunately, Stuart Gordon's ""Dagon"" proves to be an  exception to neither rule, failing despite the liberties it takes with the source material.

Though the title is borrowed from another story, ""Dagon"" is actually a version of Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth,"" one of the canonical works of the author's so-called ""Cthulhu Mythos.""  Gordon changes the setting from 1920's New England to contemporary Spain and tweaks certain elements of the plot but retains the key themes as well as some scenes.  In the end these changes neither hurt nor help, but become offensive to the faithful in the context of everything else that is wrong with the picture.

1717535,3,B000067J0M,"Sometimes hokey, sometimes eerily effective, this adaptation of H. P. Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" is directed by Stuart Gordon, who did the popular ""Re-Animator"" films.

If you're looking for a truly faithful adaptation of Lovecraft's work, you won't find it here.  For that, you should check out Lurker Films' ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and the three volumes of the H. P. Lovecraft Film Festival available on DVD (all can be ordered from Amazon).

""Dagon"", like most commercial Lovecraft-based films, mixes a the basic story concepts of ""Shadow"" --- with a nod to the story of the title, ""Dagon"", and it's a reasonably entertaining film.

My major objection is that there are one or two scenes of truly stomach-turning gore that not only go way beyond what's needed to tell a story, but are at odds with the mood and atmosphere Gordon has established in the film.  Just as Lovecraft himself sometimes attempted to bury his readers in a torrent of adjectives and adverbs in an attempt to create overwhelming horror, Gordon goes way over the top and succeeds only in disgusting the audience rather than horrifying it.  Of course, if extreme gore is your thing, you won't object to these sequences, but to me it's just disgusting.

On the plus side, the eerie village is beautifully designed (with fairly good CGI), the story clips along at a good pace, and the ending is satisfying.  Certainly not a great piece of cinema, but Lovecraft fans should check it out.  Just be prepared for one really repulsive scene.  (I fast-forwarded through it.)",1138233600,5,1550,4.904214559386973

That scene where the couple is walking through the streets on that island and they began to see odd people who look as if they have been taking too much cod liver oil is pretty creepy.  Forget about weather you like Lovecraft or not, this is a good movie and should be seen.

I don't remember this ever being released in the theater.  If it wasn't it should have been.

Even the obvious flaws--the garbled dialogue  (Francisco Rabal is particularly guilty) and the uneven pacing--actually help in furthering the effectiveness of the film's creepy atmosphere.  The use of handheld camerawork through most of the film works better here than in other films--mainly because it makes sense.  ""Dagon"" is all about the ocean--people living off it and becoming transformed into sea creatures--and the handheld camera gives the viewer a feeling of floating through most of the film.  Director Stuart Gordon gets good performances from all the principal actors--the clear standout being the mesmerizing Macarena Gomez--and wonderful contributions from the supporting cast, especially the blank-faced innkeeper.  All in all, this is my favorite Stuart Gordon film.  ""Reanimator"" is certainly a more polished effort, but, for the reasons stated above, ""Dagon"" gives a better view of the Lovecraftian world.",1135555200,,1117,5.652694610778443
1717538,2,B000067J0M,"Even as a big Lovecraft fan, I have to say this film really is not worth seeing. The basic CONCEPT remains faithful to Lovecraft's work, but the main storyline (concerning Paul, Barbara, and the other characters) has nothing to do with any of Lovecraft's work. Ok, here's what you basically get when you watch this movie. Any horror movieever that operates in the vain of most spanish/italian horror films, which for some reason involves the heroes (victims) stranded SOMEWHERE, unable to escape some horrible evil, usually a monster or ancient legendary creature, or the undead. In this one, you have a town of people who are becoming more and more like sea creatures, because they worship Dagon, and will eventually join him to live forever in the sea. The cultists occaisionally cry out ""Ya Yah Cthulhu Ftaghn"" during their ceremonies, which doesn't really make sense. If they worship Dagon, why are they making a prayer to Cthulhu? Anyway, the story is about our nerdy Woody Allen-esque hero Paul stumbling awkwardly away from the pursuing fish-people of Imboca (Spanish for Innsmouth) until 40 minutes in... Then it's mostly cult stuff.

If you're buying this movie to see Dagon, don't bother. Dagon is only seen in the film for roughly TWO seconds. Yes, he's very cool looking, but it's hardly worth the payoff to spend all that time watching Paul run around in a scooby-doo fashion.",1134950400,,1389,4.935897435897436

What i also liked was that it wasn't completley predictable. There are some gore sceenes and scares. All in all it is a silly movie, not to be taken serious at all. I would have to describe it as an R-rated long version of ""Goosebumps"". And i love Goosebumps. So it turns out that Dagon was just the thing i was in the mood for watching. Maybe that's the secret. You have to be in the mood, just like with everything else. And sometimes i am in the mood to watch something kind of silly and diferent and off the wall.

1717540,4,B000067J0M,"Okay, people, let's face the facts. No movie can live up to the gloriously imaginitive world of HP Lovecraft's writings. So why even compare them? In my opinion, Dagon is a humble salute to Lovecraft, well aware of its limits, that can be thoroughly enjoyable if taken less seriously.

The plot revolves around the characters of Paul and his girlfriend Barbara, who've been ship-wrecked. They find themselves in an eerie old town called Imboca that seems practically deserted. To their great misfortune, however, they discover that the town is well populated -- with half human half fish creatures in search of a sacrifice to their god. As if it weren't bad enough that Barbara becomes potential fish food, Paul's recent nightmares and mysterious past are actually linked to all of the madness and put him square in the middle of Imboca's prophesy. The ending was an unexpected one, and I must say I that it was an excellent one.

Dagon was decently creepy and succeeded in providing a ""Night Of The Living Dead"" feeling of inescapable horror, but I found it more interesting than scary. Although it's not an exact adaptation of either ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" or ""Dagon"", it still provided a nice storyline and a strong backing for its plot. Making a film about the legend of Dagon was tempting enough for a rental, but the Imboca characters and the stylish world of their terrifying cult really helped this out. Not to mention the makeup and special effects that, excluding a few bad CGI shots, were quite impressive. Indeed there are some darkly mesmerizing visuals to be appreciated. I, for one, was a bit surprised at the haunting beauty of this film.

Even though it doesn't cling tight to the original stories, I believe HP fans and horror fans alike would enjoy Dagon. It's an almost fairytale-like presentation of a spectacular concept that's pretty hard to ruin. And for those who find it difficult to appreciate the more in-depth parts of a movie, there's plenty of gore (including a scene where a man litterally gets his face pulled off, ew) as well as nudity (the sacrificial scene where Barbara is bouncing around while dangling above the pit -- hubba hubba!). The bottom line is, if you've even thought about renting it, you'll probably enjoy it. Just don't be disappointed because it doesn't completely match up with the stories.

Done? Good. Now watch the movie.

Done? Good. Now make a list of what ""Dagon"" and Lovecraft's  story have in common.

That was quick, wasn't it? Nothing, zilch, nada.

Oh, you've found some things in common? Well done, I congratulate you for your unbridled imagination. My turn, let me try. Here: ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" is a stunning adaptation of Richard Matheson's ""I Am Legend"". And ""Mary Poppins"" of ""Moby Dick"". See? I can play that game too.

Seriously now, not only is ""Dagon"" incredibly bad cinematographically, it is also incredibly stupid, incredibly [...], incredibly objectionable, and unbelievably unbelievable.

Incredibly stupid. I shall give only one example. When Paul, the protagonist, tries to flee in the only car in Imboca (Imboca, ""boca"" = ""mouth"" in Spanish, Imboca = Innsmouth, got it? How clever!). First, not having the key, he tries  to jump-start the engine. Oh, yes, that works on older cars (I have done it once, having lost my keys), and the car is a Citroen DS of the 1960s. So far so good... but... with his faithful Swiss-Army knife Paul cuts through a bunch of wires, strips their tips, tries shorting them at random and... blows the horn. The noise alerts the roaming mobs of monstrous Innsmouthians (er... sorry... Imboqueros I suppose), poor Paul dashes out leaving a mess of wires dangling, runs away, hides and so on. Later he manages to
knock out the car's driver, and bags the ignition key. Back into the car, key in ignition, the engine splutters... beg pardon? All the wires have been cut, there can be no juice flowing to the starter motor. Oh yeah, dear Paul must have just missed
cutting that wire... or the damage has been repaired. Sure, and the sea is boiling hot and pigs have wings.
Paul's trusty Swiss knife is also involved in an earlier scene of abysmal stupidity. Can you find it? (Hint: in the hotel).

Incredibly [...]. The warehouse with the dangling human skins is straight out of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Completely gratuitous, as there is nothing  remotely like that in Lovecraft's short story. More [...] later on.

Incredibly objectionable.  I greatly enjoyed ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". I greatly enjoyed Alejandro Jodorowski's ""El Topo"". And ""Desperate Living"", and ""Sweet Movie"" and others, graphically upsetting. So don't call me squeamish. Yet I object to the scene where the old man has his face and scalp flayed while he is still alive. Because it does not belong there. Nothing of the kind in Lovecraft's story. It is tasteless, artless,  out of order, just a gratuitous piece of despicable gore. And another piece of [...] allied to crass ignorance. Flaying their victims alive was the favourite occupation of the Aztec priests of Xipe Totec. If the sorry character guilty of this movie did really want a flaying scene, he could just tie in Cthulhu, Dagon et al.
with the Aztec pantheon, and his despicable piece of sadistic garbage could have become almost forgivable. Too ignorant, too stupid, or too lazy to do it? Take your pick. I'd say: contemptuous enough of his audience.

Unbelievably unbelievable. How does Lovecraft describe the people of Innsmouth? Fish-frog creatures. Ever seen fishes, or frogs, with tentacles? Well, the perpetrator of ""Dagon"" has, obviously. Makes you wonder what he's been smoking. Noticed how the clerk at the hotel had gills in his neck? And how Paul's mermaid paramour had gills too... on her belly? Frankly, this, what's his name again? takes viewers for complete imbeciles. And judging from all those stars he got, he is probably right.",1126310400,9,3763,4.931962025316456

I coerced my wife and youngest daughter into watching it and judging from their reactions, the movie was fairly spooky. I can't say I was spooked because I know the plot line only too well.

What surprises and pleases me the most about this movie is how well, how *faithful* the flick was to the original story--which is 90% ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" and maybe 5% of ""Dagon"", a minor work of HPL that I've read but can't recall all that well. There's a bonus to the movie that is also surprising--the updated parts (modern technology such as cell phones, etc.) are blended seamlessly into the movie and augment the atmosphere.

As the other reviewers note, this is a Grade B movie, however. The special effects aren't state of the art by any means and if that's all you care about, you might as well find a different flick.

It's the little things that matter, in this film. The fact that the hero, Paul, is classic Lovecraft in manner and appearance. He even wears a Miskatonic University sweatshirt! HPL's horror of foreigners and foreign languages, of the ocean, of anything slimy, of mold, of damn near anything a respectable but decaying Rhodey aristocrat would find yucky, is perfectly obvious in the movie. The plot, though updated to take place in Spain, rather than in New England, is remarkably faithful even to the long narration by the one townsman that remains fully human.

As in the original, Paul has narrow escape after narrow escape--indeed, quite a bit of the movie is Paul getting chased by limping, shambling, crawling monstrosities in the dark. Even the ending is faithful, which is a must for the plot line to make the slightest sense whatsoever. In point of fact, the movie has more tension in it than the story, simply because the artificial frame of the narration, so often employed by HPL, is done away with, thus establishing a sense of immediacy that Lovecraft never really achieves.

Purists of Lovecraft generally rate ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" up in the top five of the best of Lovecraft, along with *At the Mountains of Madness*, ""The Color Out of Space"", and ""The Dunwich Horror"", and it should be. And this is probably the best movie ever done from Lovecraft's work.

  The only thing for that i am giving this movie one star is the dream scene from the beginning of the movie. After that all fell down. The performances of the protagonists were awfull, in the scary department this Lovecraft's adaptation has too little - certainly it is scary only for the kids.

  The plot was in fact good but that don't count because it is an adaptation of a famous book, so it was Lovecraft's ideea, not of Stuart Gordon. The most part of the movie is laughable: the main hero's chase and those stupid masks....

1717577,4,B000067J0M,"We Lovecraft fans are a fervent bunch, and I think I speak for all of us when I say that there hasn't been a single film adaptation of his work that does his stories any justice.  They're not meant to be filmed, pure and simple.  His writing allows your imagination to run wild and think of hideous, terrifying things that don't come close to anything that can or has been conjured up on the screen.  The closest film I've seen to capturing Lovecraft's spirit is John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness-and that's not even based on any particular Lovecraft story!  In Dagon, our Lovecraft-to-film team of Stuart Gordon, Brian Yuzna and Dennis Paoli relocate to Spain to bring us their adaptation of ""Shadow Over Innsmouth"".  For those who don't know, ""Dagon"" is a short story that ties in with ""Innsmouth"", which is a much larger story.  ""Dagon"" the short story, if filmed would play out to about five or ten minutes.  Shooting in Spain with spanish actors allows Gordon to get the most out of his budget coz Hollywood would never touch something like this unless it had Orlando Bloom or was a remake of a classic horror film.  So, the big question is:  Is Dagon a good movie?  That really depends on who you ask.  If you ask me, it's a fun horror film and a terrible Lovecraft adaptation.  But then again, I was prepared for this coz I had lost faith in a faithful adaptation years ago.  If Dagon were filmed stricly to the text, it would make a good half-hour Tales From The Crypt type story considering there just isn't enough for a full length film.  So as you can guess, it varies ALOT.  It keeps the basic concept but adds characters, subplots and basically makes it much more complex than it originally was.  So, yeah, these additions and changes might have Lovecraft fans throwing their bag of Flamin' Hot Cheetos across the room in frustration screaming, ""That's not right!!  He/She never did that!  Oh, come on!!  Dammit, That was NOT in the book!!!""  On the positive side, I personally enjoyed this as a Stuart Gordon film.  If you happen to like his low budget and cheesy yet fun style of horror, you should like Dagon.  If you like gore(there's a scene of some poor SOB getting his face skinned that demands rewinding), atmosphere(the film actually does have good atmosphere that Lovecraft would probably approve of.  The town does look good, as do the creatures) and some unintentional chuckles, it's worth the rent.  This isn't gonna appeal to people of the Scream generation, Dagon's more of a throwback to that good ol' renagade drive-in horror.  The fx are decent, though the CGI I could have done without.  How come as time goes by and technology progresses, CGI seems to be going backwards and looking more and more fake?  Another high point being the young actress who plays the priestess.  I'm looking forward to seeing her in more films, she is quite gorgeous.  Lovecraft would call her, ""Gorgeous beyond description"", I'm sure.  Sure she's got gills and tentacles instead of legs, but hell, I'd do her anyway.  The verdict?  Dagon is a Stuart Gordon film, NOT a faithful Lovecraft adaptation.  Judge accordingly.",1114819200,5,3137,4.697247706422019

What we have here are many of the outward trappings of Lovecraft's great story ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" but none of the charm and subtlety,  precious little of the enjoyable frightfulness, no proper pacing in building up a feeling of dread, and no feeling of the strange beauty that comes at the end of Lovecraft's story.  Instead we get a very false Lovecraftian festival of the gruesome.  Gross, disgusting, nauseating would be accurate terminology in describing this film; Lovecraftian would not.

If you've never read Lovecraft but enjoy ""weird fiction"", you'd be doing yourself a terrible disservice if you took this film as representative of what Lovecraft created or liked.  HPL himself was rather squeamish and so one can imagine how horrified he would have been to see his name affiliated with such a gruesome spectacle.

If you love ""gross-out"" pictures, then you'll probably like this one.  If you prefer horror based on atmosphere, nuance, and creeping terror, rest assured you won't find it here.

The trend towards grossness and in-your-face horror at the cinema has been going on for probably at least 35 years.  It's sad and ironic that such a fine writer as Lovecraft would have his reputation so besmirched and distorted by being associated with something that so contraposes his own aesthetic sensibilities.",1110931200,5,1385,5.061674008810573

With that out of the way I can say if you are Lovecraft fan, you will most likely enjoy this film. Although, I would also like to clear up the notion that this film in an accurate adaptation of HPL's Innsmouth. Certain elements are potrayed very well, like the escape from the hotel scene. It's not exactly right, but they tried, and its still quite effective. I think a more apropriate way to put it is it's Stewart Gordon's most acurate adaptation of an HPL story.

I really thought the creature effects were good. I know there was a mention of bad CGI in another review, but there is very little of that. All of the foam latex work is quite good. The location in spain is more fitting to old America than the NE cost of the US now, and is quite creepy.

Where this movie lacks is the charictors. Not that the acting is even that bad. But I don't understand why they were changed, when the ones in the story were much more interesting, and this is the main reason why this movie drifts away from the real story.

Overall a very entertaining movie!",1106697600,4,1242,4.294871794871795
1717602,5,B000067J0M,"Director Stuart Gordon had a massive challenge: film H.P. Lovecraft's champagne and caviar classic ""The Shadow over Innsmouth"" on a beer and pretzels budget. With ghosties, ghoulies, long-legged beasties and squid waiting in the wings, what's a cash-strapped director to do?

Simple: Gordon packed up his team and headed off to Spain, where they could make the most of their shoestring budget and capitalize on some genuinely eerie locations. The result is one of the most faithful, ghoulish, hysterical, and genuinely unsettling adaptations of the Master's timeless and merciless mythos, and Gordon delivers the goods, making the most of his haunting Spanish locations, solid actors, and plenty of red sauce, tentacles, Elder Gods, and ghastly-gory goop.

Dot-com gazillionaire-to-be Paul (played to the bespectacled Lovecraftian hero-hilt by Ezra Godden), his pretty Spanish fiancee Barbara (played with conviction by Raquel Merono), his financier Howard (Brendan Price, for about 25 seconds), and Howard's snippy wife Vicki (Birgit Bofurull, who does snippy just as well as she does slack-jawed terror---nice job!) are all on a sailboat off the coast of Southern spain, celebrating riches to come, when a nasty squall rolls in.

Faster than you can shout ""Gilligan!"" the tiny boat is lost, wrecked on the Old Devil Reef, with Howard's snippy wife not so snippy anymore as her ravaged, trapped leg bleeds into the water. What, pray tell, might her blood attract?

Howard stays on the doomed boat with his wife while Paul and Barbara set off in a raft to get help in the eerily deserted fishing village they spied before the storm hit. They make landfall, meet the village---Imboca (""Innsmouth"" in Spanish, get it?)---priest, split up, and the fun begins!

Gordon goes heavy on the atmosphere in ""Dagon"", to telling effect: this is a movie dedicated to that white, deformed face at the window, to shadowy and batrachian figures shuffling along rain-swept cobbled streets, to inexplicable thudding sounds coming from the room above you in the foul-smelling hotel room at 3 in the morning, to the dank, the wet, the forsaken, the inbred, the bizarre. Barbara's trip to the Hotel Del Mar through the shadow-haunted streets of Imboca gave me the crawls.

Gordon is masterful at taking Lovecraft's raw horror and ratcheting it up a knotch. The scene where a perfectly normal little boy wails over his fallen, leech-mouthed ""Papa"" gave me the chills; Lovecraft would doubtless shiver and approve.

The acting here is uniformly solid. Some might be put off by Ezra Godden's bespectacled nebbish hero, but true Lovecraft enthusiasts will be delighted with the most iconic Lovecraft protagonist since the Jeffrey Combs as Herbert West in ""Re-Animator"". Godden blends a fine arsenal of nervous tics and glasses-adjusting nerdiness with panicked courage under fire, and the result is hysterical and totally believable, making ""Dagon""'s final revelation even more unnerving.

The fine Spanish veteran actor Francisco Rabal is also great; his soupy accent is a little tough to understand, but make the effort and you'll be rewarded with a superior performance. Rabal's nose is also something of a special effect in itself, nearly as terrifying as anything Imboca has to offer. Macarena Gomez is creepily gorgeous as Uxia, and the dream sequences in which she figures as a mermaid gave me nightmares---and a few pleasant dreams---for a week. Ferran Lahoz (Priest) and Jose Lifante (Hotel Del Mar Desk Clerk) gave me the crawls, and brought a huge dose of creepiness to the movie with their tiny and terrifying parts.

The real standout here aside from the deliciously Lovecraftian atmosphere is the special effects work; Gordon got the most from his limited budget, and it's all up on the screen. The Ultimate Horror of Imboca is never revealed outright until the end, merely hinted at, and the effects underscore that strategy: the effects are repellent and nasty, but subtle. Take a good look at Lahoz's hand or Lifante's head and you'll see what I mean.

There are a few missteps, chiefly some bad CGI that hurt the dramatic effect of one superbly creepy scene (you'll know it when you see it), but not enough to diminish ""Dagon's"" relentless atmosphere of tentacled ghoulishness. On a technical note, the Lion's Gate release of the film is note-perfect: the colors are beautiful, the transfer is crisp and flawless, and the Dolby sound is a little *too* good (I nearly jumped out of my skin when a froggish hoot erupted from the darkness over my left shoulder).

Dark, richly atmospheric, and genuinely unsettling, ""Dagon"" is one of the most faithful Lovecraft adaptations ever set to celluloid and a deleriously unnerving little horror film.

1717603,4,B000067J0M,"It is notoriously difficult to transfer Lovecraft to a visual medium, since so much of his horror is based on hints. How do you picture a ""thing that cannot be?"" we should probably be grateful for that - how would it be if the latest Hollywood flick drew its viewers insane (and not from boredom or inanity of the plot)?

Mr. Gordon takes one of the more visual of the stories, The Shadow over Innsmouth, and makes some modifications to it to fit the silver screen. Since the result is not an insult I give it a pass plus. The major change is that now the inhabitants have not made their unholy deal with Dagon, but directly with Great Cthuhlu himself! Who even honours us with a visit in the end, and surprisingly - it is one of the best images of Mr. C. I have seen, suitably detailed but we have only a fleeting glance, so a lot is handed over to our own imagination. The sequence has a good shock effect.

OK, why does the male lead so much act like Ash from Evil Dead? Well, again - I cannot stand horror films that take themselves to seriously, he gives a good comic contrast to the creatures of the town. Also, it actually makes his final transformation so much the more shocking.

1717604,5,B000067J0M,"Awesome!  Probably the best Lovecraft adaptation ever (in fact, it well Exceeds many of Lovecraft's written works) and probably the best film of director Stuart Gordon's career (famed for ""Re-Animator"", ""Castle Freak"", and other greats), ""Dagon"" is one of the greatest monster movies ever made as well.  In a nutshell, two couples vacationing on a small private yacht run aground of a rock outcropping in shallow waters off the coast of Spain and have to try to make it to the small, antiquated fishing village visible on the coast.  In the village, it becomes very quickly apparant that the inhabitants are...peculiar.

  It's long been thought that any Lovecraft movie that attempts to actually show in detail entities like Chthulu or Yog-Sottoth would sabotage itself no matter how good the special effects were, because most of these beings are supposed to be literally indescribable, in some cases so indescribably alien and horrifying that just seeing one full on can drive a person insane.  However, as all Lovecraft afficionados know, there are these, what are sometimes collectively called 'others', and then there are those beings who occupy an intermediary position between such 'others' on one hand and the human/animal kingdom on the other.  By wisely focusing on these 'in-betweeners', the movie ""Dagon"" can actually show more than fleeting or partial looks at the creatures without falling into the paradox of visually 'describing' the indescribable.  These 'in-betweeners' are shockingly realistic, more so than the movie's cover might have you believe, and leave one with the disturbing question of if these look the way the do, what exactly is the true nature of Dagon himself?

  The camera angles chosen are brilliant, such as the over-the-shoulder shot of the main male character as he's looking out the window and sees 'them', letting the viewer feel more as if they're experiencing the events themselves than watching someone else experience them.  Having one of the characters apparantly very capable of escaping the situation at one point but unable to do so because his girlfriend has disappeared somewhere nearby, is very effective too; somehow in this case it comes off a lot scarier than having the characters trying to escape but unable to - to have someone capable at this one point of escaping but having no choice but to choose not to.  All the characters are very believable and 'real', including the old homeless man who seems to be one of the few residents of the village to be less....different.  It may sound like I'm giving too much away here, but most of what I'm referring to occurs early on; there's a lot more going on than I plan to mention.

  Released a few years ago with minimal public awareness, right before the big horror boom hit, this title has sadly remmained a relative unknown.

1717605,4,B000067J0M,"This movie is hardly innovative in its approach and execution, but as horror films go, it definitely accomplishes what it sets out to do:  deliver one heck of a creepy feeling direct to your spinal column.  Remarkably, it is able to do this without whiz-bang special effects and an egregiously bloated budget.  One of the greatest accomplishments of this film is to demonstrate that a filmmaker with vision can overcome financial obstacles to get their ideas on the screen.  Films, like the ills of society, cannot be improved by throwing money at them.

WHO SHOULD WATCH THIS:

Unlike many other so-called ""horror"" films, this one is actually scary.  Not so much at first, though.  A viewer will probably turn off the TV and go to bed without any pervading sense of dread.  The insidious nature of this film is that the horror-effect will gradually grow well after you have returned the DVD to the rental store.  Gradually, the tendrils of terror seep into your brain until you realize that you can't stop thinking about this film.  Then, one night, you wake up in the darkness of your room, too afraid to use the bathroom.  This is a payoff the creative minds behind the likes of Freddy, Jason, or Michael Myers have not been able to achieve for quite along time.

WHO SHOULD AVOID:

In spite of the low budget, this movie has some unabashedly violent imagery that is not for the squeamish.  Hard-core horror fans will have no problem with it, but their dates might.  There are also some scenes of containing nudity and sexual situations that may offend those lacking in prurient interests.

but at the end of the movie, i simply couldn't forgive Paul and Barbara for not running. these are FISH PEOPLE, for heaven's sake--they can barely hobble about on land, and they aren't exactly the sharpest cookies in the cupboard. the ""holding cells"" into which the captives are herded could be kicked down by a small contingent of special-ed kindergarteners, and much time is wasted trying to salvage a suicidally insane (and possibly pregnant with slimy demon spawn) compatriot who is clearly, hopelessly, chronically DOOMED. leave her ass, for crying out loud! she's got a knife and she's going to use it on herself! you can't stop her, you barely know her, and you don't particularly like her ... so use her as a distraction! now make like a missionary and get the devil out of there! cripes. okay, fine. stay there and make whimpery, floppy-lip faces. you get no sympathy from ME.
eventually i just got bored of screaming, ""FLY, YOU FOOLS!"" and i wanted everyone to hurry up and get sacrificed to death and be done with it. the ending (for those of you who have seen the movie and have been waiting for me to bring this up) is perfectly weird--but not altogether out of left field if you're a Lovecraft reader. i don't know. it's not how i would have concluded the tale, but heck, i'd more or less lost interest in what happened to the protagonists by the time the weirdness came around, so i can't say it bothered me any.",1088553600,5,2089,4.694822888283379
1717608,3,B000067J0M,"Those of you who love the man will universally agree that there just isn't enough H.P. Lovecraft in the world, especially in cinema.  Most of the movie versions made, that have been in some way remotely influenced by a short story or novella, have been less than inspiring.  Noteworthies include Unnamable I and II, The Dunwhich Horror (with Dean Stockwell), Horror Hotel (with the great Christopher Lee) and of course the Reanimator series.  Dagon falls closer to noteworthy, but misses the mark.  I guess the thing about Lovecraft is that he was a very dry, but verbose writer; his stories had slow build-ups that tended to end in horrific, often-mind blowing climaxes--hence the problem of translating his ideas to the big screen, as few people have the patience to watch a scary movie that slowly builds to an intellectually and sensually gratifying climax.  So, producer Yuzna and director Gordon have sacrificed much of the exposition moved ""The Shadow Over Innsbrook"", the story much of this movie hails from, and have turned Dagon into a cat and mouse game of chase for most of the movie to keep the tension and suspense going.  The idea of the Old Ones, so central to the Lovecraft mythology, is barely mentioned and thrown in too quickly at the end of the film to really appeciate the horrific consequences of selling out to a race of beings older than anything on the planet.  Ezra Godden does a decent job as the lead, Paul, a stockbroker caught with three other friends in a mysterious storm and forced to seek help in a nearby Spanish town.  The residents are quite creepy, and the dream sequences are woven into the storyline very appropriately.  There is also a flashback scene which is one of the best parts of the film.  Overall, Dagon will satisfy the horror buff in anyone who loves this genre, but whether this movie leaves you pondering and thinking about it five minutes after you put the DVD back in its case is a different matter.",1086998400,3,1955,4.723529411764706
1717609,4,B000067J0M,"""Dagon"" is not as bad as you think that it is for most of the first two-thirds of the movie, but you do not really know that until you get near the end of the film at which point you have an opportunity to rethink the problematic elements that were threatening to overwhelm it up to that point.  Otherwise you are constantly wondering why Paul (Ezra Godden) is still alive because this guy outlives a couple of cats in this movie.
This 2001 horror film is based on a pair of H.P. Lovecraft stories, ""Dagon,"" an extremely short little story that was one of the first pieces the author got published, and ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth.""  Lovecraft was my favorite horror writer when I was a teenager and I have been always disappointed with what happens to his work on the silver screen or on Rod Serling's ""Night Gallery,"" which did a couple of his short stories including ""Pickman's Model"" (if I had my druthers I would make ""At the Mountains of Madness"" into a movie).
The story begins with a quartet of Americans in a sailboat off the coast of Spain, approaching a old fishing town, when a storm suddenly and strangely appears, driving their boat onto the rocks.  One of them is hurt, so Paul and his girlfriend Barbara (Raquel Meroo) head for shore in the dinghy to get help.  However, the town seems almost deserted and the people they encounter are, to say the least strange.  The next thing we know Paul is on his own and starting to get in way, way over his head in terms of being in trouble, especially since some of the things in the weird dream he had are starting to show up in the real world.
There are several things working to the advantage of director Stuart Gordon's film.  First, a lot of the people in this town speak Spanish (and another language) and there is no attempt to translate any of what they are saying.  If, like Paul, you know very little about the Spanish language (or the other language) then you are can identify with the character's sense of isolation because he does not understand what is being said to him either.  Second, if you are looking for scenes in horror movies that have you squirming in your seats if not averting your eyes from what you are seeing, then ""Dagon"" is one of those films.  You see, the natives have a peculiar use for hapless visitors that come to their town.  Third, they found Macarena Gmez to play the mysterious women from Paul's dreams.  I looked at this unknown actress with her wide eyes and all I could think of was that this was the reincarnation of Barbara Steele, except the star of ""La Maschera del demonio"" (a.k.a. ""Black Sunday"") is still among the living.  Suffice it to say that Gmez provides an interesting blend of exotic beauty and psychotic horror.
Working against ""Dagon"" is the fact that Paul pushes his luck repeatedly through most of this film and even if he is wearing glasses and is the weaker person in his relationship with Barbara he keeps surviving situation after situation in which mere mortals should end up being dead.  Also, the makeup and special effects for the monsters (it is a Lovecraft story; there are monsters; he usually avoids describing the monsters as anything other than monsters too terrible to describe but in a film you get to actually see them) are pretty much on the B-movie level, which I suppose is what Gordon is really going for here.  Then there is the fact that female nudity, which is so earnestly avoided at all of the early opportunities in the film, suddenly becomes abundant in the last act.  Also, for most of the movie the music is really two slow (and the roll of the final quotes is even slower).
The scale tips in favor of this film because it is arguably the most faithful adaptation of Lovecraft to date and because it has a scene that really gave me the wiggins.  Obviously ""Dagon"" is not really faithful to the two stories on which it is based, but my point is that Dennis Paoli's screenplay honors Lovecraft's body of work in terms of the Deep Ones and the entire Cthulhu Mythos, which is more important than tossing in references to the ""Necronomicon"" or Miskatonic University.  Plus Gordon films a lot of the big action scenes in the rail, which usually works well even when you are not making a horror film.  But the most important things here is that fans of Lovecraft's works will not feel he was abused by this film, which forgives a great many faults all things being considered.",1085529600,17,4419,4.530150753768845

Foul weather blows in *very* suddenly in a gorgeously filmed scene, huge dark clouds rising up over the little seaside town.  The sailboat is pushed into the rocks where Vicki is pinned belowdecks.

Paul and Barbara must take the dingy to shore to seek help.  The town filmed here is very cool; narrow, climbing streets and alleys between tall villas and not a soul to be seen anywhere.  Until they find the church, but this is no ordinary church.  The symbols inside are unrecognizable, and the priest behaves quite strangely.  Fortunately, Barbara speaks Spanish and convinces the priest to help.  Paul goes back to sailboat where there is no sign of their friends, and Barbara goes to local hotel to wait, where she is promptly abducted by the hotel clerk and the priest.
Paul checks into the filthy hotel, and things start to get weird when the townsfolk come out to play; and here is where the fun begins.
Eerily determined, they stagger and creep through the streets in search of Paul.  Paul runs into an old man named Eziquiel (Francisco Rabal), who tells him a strange tale of the beginnings of the odd little church, and of course Paul believes he is mad.
With Eziquiel's help, Paul searches for Barbara, running into all kinds of trouble.  I don't want to give away any of the juicier, more tingly parts of the movie, but suffice to say that my hunger for monsters, grotesqueries, blood, creepiness, and action was sated.
One fine face peeling scene is quite noteworthy and worth the movie in and of itself.
He finds the beautiful woman that he had been seeing in his dreams, Uxia; who embraces him and teaches him the mysteries of Cthullu, whether he wants to hear them or not.

This is truly a great horror flick, with wonderful monsters and lots of blood, a creepy atmosphere and an ending you won't want to miss.

Often, the author's stories--which eventually became known as the Cthulhu mythos--placed nosy human beings in direct conflict with these eldritch terrors. After Lovecraft's death in the 1930s, other authors stepped forward and wrote their own tales of terror incorporating many of the same themes found in those original yarns. Perhaps it was inevitable that moviemakers would attempt to transform some of these stories into feature films. Efforts to do so should have been successful, especially nowadays when CGI technology and other elaborate means exist to actualize Lovecraft's nameless horrors. Unfortunately, only a handful of films based on this author's writings have come close to conveying the dread found on the written page. Director Stuart Gordon is responsible for several of the success stories; he is the guy who made ""The Reanimator"" and ""From Beyond,"" two movies based on Lovecraft tales that really work well. Sadly, ""Dagon"" constitutes one of Gordon's rare misses, a movie that works on several levels while failing on many more.
A group of people, including our hero Paul and his Spanish wife, run into trouble off the coast of Spain when a sudden storm devastates their vessel. Seeing a coastal fishing village within hailing distance, Paul and his wife decide to set out for help. There is some worry about how fast this weird storm came up, but help is absolutely necessary because one of the female passenger's legs is bleeding and caught in the crushed boat. Things get a lot weirder once Paul and his woman reach the village. Realizing they no longer need help with the boat because they saw it sink shortly after the left it, they have little choice but to examine the surroundings. The village is a dank, smelly place that initially looks abandoned. The discovery of an odd church and the creep manning the desk at the local inn raise more red flags, as does the filthy room Paul rents. Even worse, Paul gets the sinking feeling that a recurring dream he frequently has is starting to remind him of this odd little town. Suspicions turn to shrieking horror when our hero discovers that the town's population consists of weird human/fish hybrids, all of who want to kill the human intruders in unpleasant ways. Paul becomes separated from Barbara and ends up meeting a strange old geezer who tells him a weird tale.
According to this old tar, the village was once a prosperous fishing area until the sea became lifeless. As the people slowly died of poverty and starvation, a lifeline appeared in the form of Dagon. An ancient sea god with a bad attitude, this deity promises salvation and wealth if the citizens worship him and his minions. The result is the shambling sea beasties presently tracking Paul. Paul's mission, if he chooses to accept it (and he does), is to find his woman and get the heck out of Dodge. All types of obstacles appear in his way, not the least of which is a pale faced little girl Paul runs across from time to time. This girl also appeared in our hero's dreams sporting a mouth full of razor sharp teeth. Predicatably, the sea creatures capture Paul and threaten to do him in if he doesn't play along. They also detain the old tar as well, a fact that achieves stomach churning dimensions when several of the fish men promptly peel his face and scalp from his head. Paul comes within inches of destruction himself before he discovers the reason why he ended up in the village and what the creatures expect from him. It should go without saying that Paul's destiny isn't a pretty picture, involving as it does the corporeal form of Dagon, Paul's dream girl, and his hapless girlfriend. The end.
""Dagon"" went straight to video for a variety of reasons. For one thing, the movie isn't all that engaging. The script has so many holes that you could sail a battleship through it. I am still scratching my head over Paul's sudden reversal at the end, and that is only one of the problems in this swiss cheese movie. As for the acting, don't go there. It's awkward and not in a good way. One problem here rests with the choice of Ezra Godden to play the Paul role. This guy looks so much like Gordon regular Jeffrey Combs that I thought Godden was that actor's brother or son. Why not just get Combs to play the part? One of the great elements of Gordon's prior efforts is Jeffrey Combs, as many others would surely agree. Perhaps Jeff was busy with another role, but I sorely miss him here. Finally, the CGI effects used in ""Dagon"" are ineffective and cheesy, especially when the time to reveal tentacles and the like rolls around. Gordon's film would have, could have, and should have been better with a few minor changes to script, cast, and effects.
What does work with ""Dagon"" is the sense of doom hanging over the film like a veil. The village, with its windswept and rain driven streets, does a lot to promote a sense of eeriness. That horrific scalping looked great too, an effect that would probably make a few viewers unused to these types of films lose their lunch. The girl who plays the creature in Paul's dream is truly frightening looking and is a good addition to the film. Overall, ""Dagon"" is an average horror thriller too often marred with mediocrities--like the acting, plodding pace, and weak script--to merit an enthusiastic review. It's worth watching once before moving on to greener fields.",1072483200,5,5525,4.774294670846395
1717661,4,B000067J0M,"""Dagon"" is one of the few attempts to capture the essence of H.P. Lovecraft's works that actually manages to convey his sense of horror and dread to the screen. Inspired by two Lovecraft short tales - ""Dagon"" and ""The Shadow over Innsmouth""- the plot follows two  couples who are on a yacht cruise celebrating the succes of their dot.com co. when a freak storm wrecks their boat and sends two of them to the coastal town of ImBoca for help. Upon arrival, the man- Ezra Godden, effectively filling a  role originally intended for director Stuart Gordon's regular Jeffrey Combs, begins to realize all is not right when his girlfriend vanishes and a society of half human/half fish denizens emerges from the rainy, dilapidated village to sacrfice them to the sea deity Dagon.
  Here are the flaws- and this is where there are some spoilers, so the uninitiated beware:
1) in the scene where Paul is besieged by a literal horde of the fish-people in his hotel room, his actions seem clever at first, but the end result leaves you wondering ""Hey, why in the hell didn't he just bust through the secondary door to begin with?""
2) When the 'High Priestess"" is revealed for the first time from the waist down, her ""appendages"" could gave been more realistic- I say this becuase , by and large, the fish people prostethics created for this film are very, very convincing, and in this scene the f/x people dropped the ball.
3) The sole surviving human in ImBoca ( Francisco Rabal ) is so difficult to comprehend through his thick accent that you wish the flashback sequence- which does a damned fine job of explaining the events leading to Imbopca's current state of affairs without the aide of narration- had been left in just that condition: Lacking narration.
Beyond those qualms which- believe me- do not really detract from the cumulative effect of the film, this is a creepy, exciting, well acted and well directed adaptation of a Lovecraft tale from the people who brought us ""Re-animator."" I highly recommend this to horror fans and to fans of good, freaky cinema. One other note, Lovecraft fans should get a real kick out of one of the film's better in-jokes. Check out Paul's sweater early on in the film.",1071792000,3,2204,4.716883116883117

If a movie that makes you actively want the main character to die (preferably the most painful death your numbed brain can come up with) is a movie you want to see, Dagon is perfect. However, if you want to actually enjoy a movie (and avoid a few months of nightmares in witch an irritatingly scrawny likewise pale man is dying), stay far far away from this movie.

1717664,4,B000067J0M,"Usually whenever one of H. P. Lovecraft's short stories is filmed, the result is a discredit to the master of 19th century horror fiction.  However, director Stuart Gordon took DAGON, one of Lovecraft's lesser known short works and has presented a stunning thriller that keeps the viewer's mind firmly entrenched in a morass of religious paganism, creepy sets, and surprisingly effective acting.  After I finished seeing this film, I had to take some moments to analyze how much the fish-god Dagon impacted on me.  Director Gordon cleverly kept changing the film's pace so what started out as a pleasure boat ride with a mixture of nerds, Hispanicas, and middle class types quickly morphed into a series of visual horrors.  The hero is Paul, who begins the film as some bespectacled dweeb who cannot comprehend why his Latina girlfriend tossed his PC overboard when he fails to pay sufficient attention to her.  A storm cloud appears with amazing speed and beaches the craft on a reef near a town on the coast of Spain.  He and his girlfriend Barbara paddle a raft to town where they find it inhabited by citizens whose faces and anatomy are at first vague and well-hidden by swaddling clothes.  Slowly, both recognize that the town's residents are more fish than human.  Decades ago, during a time of economic crisis, they abandoned Christ to worship the Philistine god of fish, Dagon, who over the years has been altering the DNA of his captive townspeople so that they grow fins, scales, and gills.  The thrust of the second half is to discover if Paul and Barbara can escape before they are offered to Dagon as sacrifice.
DAGON is a successful horror film, not because of the special effects, which, by the way, are upsettingly frightful, but because of the interaction between actor and setting.  Much of the outdoor filming takes place in a dreary evening downpour which accentuates a middle ground between the two humans who are land bound and the fish-people who are water-linked. The followers of Dagon lumber slowly around or simply slither in and out of each scene.  Paul tries mightily to dart around these fish-folk out of water, and he does elude them long enough for him to discover a shocking truth that took both him and the viewer totally by surprise.  One of the supporting actors was Francisco Rabal, who plays the last human resident of the town.  His character is old and grizzled, but despite his drunken demeanor and thick accent emerges as a man of immense dignity who remembers what his town was like before the acolytes of Dagon took over.  By the closing credits, I found myself more concerned with his fate than with Paul's and Barbara's.  The chilling horror of Lovecraft's Chluthu monster is in DAGON transformed in a series of of visceral images that cause the viewer to ponder the impossibility of what he just has seen and to conclude that only the best of the horror genre can force him to think that maybe the impossible is possible after all.",1067040000,,2979,4.779727095516569

It isn't completely true to the original story but it holds enough to make it a good film.  I won't waste my time telling you the plot.  The effects are great for the budget and I'm alwayas happy to see the Elder Gods on screen.  With a great story, creepy atmosphere and nice gore, it's well worth your money.

Knowing of Yuzna and Gordon's longtime ambition to film this story, I was keen to see the realisation - but disappointed to find it set in a SPANISH fishing village instead of good ol' Innsmouth in the USA where it rightly belongs. There is a reasonable use of atmosphere - shambling Deep Ones and so on - and the Esoteric Order of Dagon cult is depicted well - yet the Zadok Allen character from HPL's story being depicted as a Spanish speaker is outright odd; the budgetary constraints that led to the story being filmed in Spain mean it's just not quite correct in feel. I felt sorry for the lead actor, who is filmed stumbling through what seems continuous rain throughout the film. This is a noble and well-intentioned attempt; but botched attempts at Lovecraft are a dime a dozen; for my money, the movie THE RESURRECTED (based on Lovecraft's THE CASE OF CHARLES DEXTER WARD) is still the best movie adaptation of the Master's work.  DAGON would be OK to show friends who know nothing of HPL and it does give some of the flavour - in fact in parts it reminded me of the creepy atmosphere of the Lovecraft CDROM game NECRONOMICON - but for diehard fans it lacks the true flavour of edlritch fear and horror.

1717714,4,B000067J0M,"I wasn't sure of what to expect when I got this movie, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Keep in mind that is is no Re-Animator or From Beyond, but I think it is still a pretty good piece of work.  The story starts of with a pair of couples on a yacht who get caught in a storm off the coast of a small fishing village in Spain and thier boat is damaged.  One couple gets stuck on the sinking boat while the other couple try to make it to shore to get help.  The couple going for help find the town almost completely deserted and desperately try to get assistance for their stranded shipmates.  Slowly the revelation is made that there is an aura of evil over the town, and the townspeople have a sinister secret.  I think the director did a very god job in creating an air of creepiness through the movie, and the actors seemed to hold up their end pretty well.  Not as gory or graphic as Re-Animator or From Beyond, but enough to keep fans satisfied.  There is one scene where someone gets their face removed that was pretty graphic, so I wouldn't recommend this for mainstream audiences.  I don't want to give too much away, let the movie reveal itself on it's own, but if you're familiar with H.P. Lovecraft and his work you can probably guess what's happening.  And I agree with a previous reviewer in that the woman playing the priestess was completely and utterly freakishly haunting!  This is a horror movie, but I enjoyed the comedic elements injected throughout the movie, as in Re-Animator or Evil Dead.  One thing that did annoy me a little about this movie was that the main male character tended to spout a particular phrase about evey 15 minutes.  I am still waiting for From Beyond to come out on DVD, but until then, this was a nice diversion and an interesting trip into the Cthulhu mythos.",1052265600,4,1807,4.406626506024097
1717715,2,B000067J0M,"15 years after FROM BEYOND producer Brian Yuzna and director Stuart Gordon reunite again for another excursion into H.P Lovecraft territory.
Their latest collaboration centres around a group of people who end up stranded on an island where the townspeople worship a bloodthirsty pagan demon named Dagon, who predictably needs blood sacrifices from the mindless sheep who worship him. Sounds good (the movie was a Nominee for Best Movie at the 2002 International Fantasy Film Awards) but sadly this is nowhere near reaching the high standards of  RE-ANIMATOR or FROM BEYOND. The CREATIVITY and HUMOR largely aren't there. If Gordon and Yuzna are hoping to return to their glory days, then they've failed in that respect.
But on the plus side there are numerous scenes guaranteed to satisfy horror fans; including a rather gory torture sequence in which a man has his face peeled off, as well as the crucifixion and ritualistic mutilation of a pretty girl who is about to be sacrificed to Dagon (Obviously this ""god"" isn't picky about his diet consisting solely of virgins).

  Not only is it wonderfully accurate, but also envelops the whole notable dark and disturbing atmosphere that is so important to the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. Also, there are many little things in the movie that only Lovecraft readers would grasp onto... the reference to Miskatonic University, and the town ""En Boca"" in which the story takes place, cleverly means Innsmouth.

Being a BIG fan of both director Stuart Gordon and producer Brian Yuznas' previous work, the prospect of another H.P.Lovecraft adaptation made by the guys who gave us the gonzo horror hit RE-ANIMATOR and the equally spaced-out FROM BEYOND was too good to pass up.
Thankfully, the film is a triumph. The right amount of atmosphere, tension, sexual undercurrent and (of course) bloodletting combine to produce a truly unique horror experience. The timing of this movie seemed to be just right, as the horror genre seemed to be flagging under its own weight. What with teen-led slasher flicks dominating the movie theatres, this small, weird little movie about people turning into fish is just what the genre needed. The story is simple. When a boating accident forces Paul Marsh (an excellent Ezra Godden) and his girlfriend to seek help on the small spanish isle of Imboca, they uncover a dark and otherwordly secret about this quaint fishing village. As the story progresses, we learn that the towns folk have struck a deal with the monsterous god of the sea Dagon, who has helped the village prosper in bad times and in return, must have his hunger satsified.
The film has many high points. One in particular gory sequence is reminiscant of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with a cast member being peeled apart by the clearly insane villagers. Lead actor Ezra Godden is well cast (however, he bears a striking resemblance to regular Gordon/Yuzna star Jeffrey Combs - a coincidence?), and he is clearly having fun in the role, coming off like a bewildered Bruce Campbell in many of his scenes. Fanboys take note of the sweater that he's wearing. Nice touch. The rest of the cast a good too, with the beautiful Macarena Gomez dominating every scene she is in.
As with this kind of movie, the make-up effects work is top notch. Just the right amount of rubber monsters in this CGI age. Thats not to say DAGON doesn't have its fair share of computer-trickery, it just thankfully keeps it to a minimum. That said, I didn't find the CG work that bad (considering the obvious budgetry constraints), but the excellent prosthetic work stands head and shoulders above it. The cinematography is lush, with cool aqua blues complimenting the story and Gordons' direction is imaginative and commanding as ever. He really is the best guy at adapting Lovecraft, and fulfilling the strange visions and mannersims of the text. Dennis Paolis' screenplay is funny, sick and inventive in equal measure, and one wishes these three guys made movies more often.
Lions Gates' disc is good. Offering an excellent transfer of the film with two informative commentaries (one by writer/director, the other by star/director). They both get into the meat of the production and offer an entertaining chat about the movie...",1048896000,10,2834,4.90625

That being said, it is a great effort to put to film the great writing of Lovecraft.  Though both stories, ""Dagon"" and ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" are great stories, it is obvious this is based on the later, and has little to do with the former.
The lead character and his girlfriend are enjoying a yacht trip with another couple when they become stranded near a creepy fishing village.  The first pair decide to go to the village for help, and are quickly embroiled in the conspiracy of men who are part sea creature.  They become more ichythysian as time goes on, and don't want outsiders discovering their secret worship of the god Dagon or their condition.  They perform rituals in the praise of Dagon, and wear human skin during these rituals.  The merefolk have a sinister purpose and evil designs against the couple as they battle through a ""Night of the Living Dead"" type scenario against ""Creature From the Black Lagoon"" type beings.
This film is well done, and a lot of fun (especially fun for people familiar with the Lovecraftian mythos).  The plot is familiar to American audiences, with nothing too unusual (aside from Lovecraft's bizarre ideas mixed in).  Would Lovecraft have approved?  In general, Lovecraft didn't like films, so he probably would have disliked this one with rest.  As is the usual, this film does not live up to actually reading the story, and does not live up to the ""Dagon"" story at all, but it is Lovecraftian in intent and thrust, and fans of Lovecraft and horror films will not be disappointed.",1046563200,2,1662,4.77972027972028

1717754,5,B000067J0M,"...If you've ever read the story ""Dagon"" you know it's just a short about a castaway that sails into a morass and sees a nasty green behemoth capering around an oblelisk, just Lovecraft meat and potatoes. This movie is actually based on ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"", though it's bottlenecked on an island instead of the coast of New England. I thought this was the best (and only decent) Lovecraft movie since T.D.H. with super hot Sandra Dee. There are major differences, of course, such as the addition of the hero AND his girlfriend. Lovecraft seemed to stay away from the chick factor whenever possible. And there is the fact that a hybrid priestess is involved, and the fact that Dagon's spawn, the Deep Ones, were a roughly bipedal version of fish and frog: In here, they tend towards octopoid traits, which makes you think of the main man Cthulhu. So don't worry, it's still cool.
The hero and his girlfriend get stranded on the island, and the girl is immediately abducted by the freakish Dagon cultists. The hero, Paul (Marsh) is constantly plagued by dreams involving a nice looking little chick who frequently displays tentacles, fins and fangs. He ends up in a moldering, filthy hotel (check out the toilet in that place!), like the classic scene from Shadow Over Innsmouth, waiting for the return of his girlfriend, not knowing that she's been taken. This affords a kind of comical part of the movie, where all the flounder-eyed, webbed and tentacled freaks come to pay him a visit. He ends up escaping, crashing through a window, running through a gauntlet of cultists, until he eventually finds the poor old drunk guy, the only human on the island, that explains to him the advent and degenerate worship of the god Dagon. In the movie, Dagon takes on an uncharacteristic alpha male love-hungry mode, demanding female sacrifices to carry his unholy seed. The result of these sacrifices is a race of hybrid creatures that eventually shed their human vestigies to become blissful, ageless sea monsters.
Marsh eventually finds the flesh and blood girl of his dreams, drawn to her in ways he doesn't understand. She is the local high priestess, no less, a blood descendant of the seafaring captain that originally brought the Dagon theology to the island. When he pulls back the sheet and sees that she's a little more monster than chick, he freaks out and is on the run again. All of the running with the shambling, loping and crawling man-monsters only a breath or two behind him, kind of creepy and yet funny too, really captures the essence of Shadow Over Innsmouth. I didn't get the whole ritual thing with the skinning and tanning of human hides, though. The cultists wear ther skins to their ritual ceremonies; I think maybe they watched Chainsaw Massacre about two or three hundred times too many.
Near the end of the movie, expect a cameo by the big man himself, Dagon, who just needs a little love and understanding. I hope that the effort that went into this movie might mark the future efforts of other attempts. What about At the Mountains of Madness? Shadow out of Time? Or the Call of Cthulhu? Yeah baby.

1717756,4,B000067J0M,"First off, while this movie is called Dagon, it's actually based largely on ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth,"" one of Lovecraft's most successful stories. Of course, it has been modernized, but it I think it still held true to what Lovecraft was shooting for. Even though the film was made by Stuart Gordon, who directed the other two best Lovecraft movies (The Re-Animator and From Beyond), I wasn't expecting much when I picked this one up. However, I was wrong to underestimate it.
The movie, although undoubtedly ""B"", was spectacular. The scenes were erie, suspenseful, and ominous, the acting quite decent (Ezra Godden from Band of Brothers plays the overwhelmed, nuerotic lead), and I didn't even mind the sometimes poor CGI special effects. As far as the movie goes, it is much more like From Beyond than Re-Animator, in that it attempts to be more wicked and dark than campy. Although it's not too violent, there are one or two somewhat gory scenes. It was shot in spain, and the run down town was very effective at provoking a sense of the macabre.
As far as the plot goes, it's about a group of friends in a boating accident that forces one couple to seek help on a nearby island. When they get to the run down island village, they found out that it is inhabited by a race of subhuman creatures that worship a dark sea god. It's not long before they realize they would have been better off drowning.
I really liked it and if you are a Lovecraft fan, or if you enjoyed Re-Animator or From Beyond, you will want to give this fair go at Lovecraft on screen a chance.",1040601600,11,1567,4.540636042402827

1717758,3,B000067J0M,"Dagon (Stuart Gordon, 2001)
After fifteen long years of production, Stuart Gordon's original follow-up to Re-Animator finally finds itself released. In the interim, of course, Gordon has directed a number of other films, most of which, says the going wisdom, didn't live up to the original Re-Animator. (I disagree, but that's beside the point.) Predictably, the biggest blurb on the video cover says... ""Stuart Gordon's best since Re-Animator!"" Caveat emptor.
For once, Gordon finds himself working with a relatively high-powered cast on a Lovecraft adaptation. Ezra Godden (Band of Brothers) is the hapless hero and boyfriend of the hapless female lead, TV actress Raquel Merono. The two are in a boating accident off a small, rocky island off the coast of Spain, where they go to try and find help. Needless to say, since it's based n a Lovecraft story, ""help"" is not what it seems. Trust the village priest (Ferran Lahoz [Faust]) or the village nutcase (the late capo di tutti capi of Spanish cinema, Franceso Rabal [Tie me Up! Tie Me Down!])? And why is everyone dressed in those bulky raincoats?
It's a Stuart Gordon film, so you know it's going to rank high on the Joe Bob Briggs scale of greatness: lots of blood, lots of breasts, and the highest number of beasts per capita since Romero's Day of the Dead. You can also rest assured that the special effects are going to be cheesy at best. This is Stuart Gordon; the cheese factor is always high. I mean, the man gave Jeffrey Combs a career.
But too much about the film says that the cheese factor is at times unintentional. The CGI (for one can lo longer make a horror film that does not contain CGI) is painfully obvious in and around the shipwreck scene. More noticeably, there's a scene after Godden and Merono reach the mainland where Godden accidentally gets a large, nasty fishhook embedded in the palm of his left hand and has to extract it. The scene would have been stomach-turning if that hand hadn't so obviously been made of rubber. (Note to self: rubber and skin do not look alike when wet.) If you can get past the cheese factor, the story is vintage Lovecraft (""The Shadow over Innsmouth""), the acting is, well, better than usual for a Gordon flick, and the sets are gorgeous (it was shot on location in Spain). But both Dolls and From Beyond are markedly better-filmed than this. For Gordon completists, but the novice will want to start with one of those two or Re-Animator. ** ",1038009600,5,2454,4.72027972027972

1717760,5,B000067J0M,"Dagon is an extraordinary film worthy in some respects of David Lynch.
The film's Spanish location at first put me off as did the thick accent of some of the actors.  However I soon found that this choice in casting and filming was an initial step into the strange and foreign where everyday reality twists itself into the shape of the monstrous and grotesque.
Dagon is truly Lovecraftian in spirit as well as content and the gorgeous cinematography, the shambling demented forms, the gurgling voices and constant rain grip our lead as he tries to slog and shift his way through the demented world where he is trapped.
Francisco Rabal, who plays a tortured old drunk whose life has been destroyed by the sinister seaside village, is absolutely wonderful and turns in the best performance I have seen in any film in recent memory.  While his speech can be difficult to follow, there is a wild power and authority behind the words that make the indecipherable pieces frightening in themselves.
Stuart Gordon has revealed himself to be a master filmmaker like Lynch or even Todd Browning.  While I felt Reanimator was a little too campy when I saw it years ago, seeing Dagon makes me want to catch that again as well as anything else Gordon has done or will do.  I'm simply awed by the artistry of this film.
And assuming you want to make it a double feature for a near-perfect Friday night with the lights out and plenty of popcorn on hand, you might want to pick up Sea Creature too.  This film is not by Gordon but is very Lovecraftian in scope and followers of Dagon everywhere would do well to plop their tentacles on the couch and view it.",1036195200,4,1642,4.571428571428571

But the more that I watched this movie the move I liked it. I have definitely not ever seen a movie quite like this one. I guess I could say that it kind of grew on me. I have purchased it now and I can say without a doubt that it is one of the better horror movies that I have seen in a long time. It has good gore (there is one scene that is not for the faint of heart), a good story line (except for a few holes) and some gratuitous nudity as well. There is a creepy atmosphere that works very well for this movie. They couldn't have picked a better location for shooting this film. The little fishing village looks like a very interesting place. All in all this is a very unique movie. Add it to your collection. Or at the very least rent it. You will not be sorry.",1031270400,6,1087,3.900900900900901
1717803,5,B000067J0M,"I enjoy Lovecraft's stories, and the Cthulhu mythos tales especially.  One of his creepier tales is ""A Shadow Over Innsmouth"".  It's the story of a town whose people are hybrids of human and an ancient sea dwelling race called the Deep Ones.  An outsider comes to the town and is pursued by the shambling, gurgling villagers as he discovers their dark secrets.
The film ""Dagon"" is based on the Lovecraft story.  To cut down on costs, the production is filmed in Spain rather than New England (the location of the Lovecraft stories).  This actually works well.  The coastal town has a damp, run down feel and the locals speaking another language further alienates the main characters.
A boating accident causes a young couple to have to paddle to a fishing town inhabited by strange, malformed people.  As in the Lovecraft story, they soon find trouble.  It all culminates with a sinister ceremony to Dagon, one of those dark gods of the sea.  It is all well done and pretty effective.
The actors are all pretty much unknowns.  The standout is the woman who plays the priestess.  She is both creepy and beautiful at the same time.  She dominates every scene she is in.
My only complaint is the use of some poor CGI effects.  They did so well with so little through the rest of the film, it's a shame they resort to budget CGI that snaps you out of the mood when it appears.  Better effects are shown in video game cutscenes.
Overall, this is solid saturday night beer and pretzel viewing.  Not fit for the kiddies.  There are a couple of pretty gruesome effects.  Now if they would just make a movie based on The Call of Cthulhu...",1031184000,17,1630,4.56551724137931

Dagon did for me what Lovecraft's books do for me - creeped me out, a little. I like that. I think it's got the most true-to-form Lovecraftian-feel to it than any other film to date. I liked recognizing direct references from the books, those ""shambling, bleating, misshappen forms"" chasing our reluctant hero; the church, that was once wholesomely Christian, converted to something else - not overtly bad but mysterious and strange, etc.
I have a tendency to pick out the good things I like in a film, and ignore the bad as much as possible; and I didn't find the bad stuff too distracting. The acting, characters, faithfulness to story, effects, music, and overall feeling were all decent enough to get the job done: creep me out, a little. A job well done! Ia!

1717805,4,B000067J0M,"""Dagon"" is a  B-grade (in the good sense) horror movie that suffers, rather than being helped, by being a close adaptation of Lovecraft's ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth.""  The movie does not bring Lovecraft to the screen (I'm convinced that's impossible), and  I think any viewers trying to force themselves to believe that Gordon has successfully channelled Lovecraft is going to be disappointed.
The film, however,  is effective on its own merits, and if so viewed, it's highly satisfying.  The key to watching this movie is to recognize that the story revolves not around Paul, the ostensible lead, but around Uxia, the libidinous, oddly-beautiful priestess played by Macarena Gomez.  It's not necessarily scripted that way, it just happens.  Whenever Uxia is on the screen, she owns the show; whenever she is off the screen, you're waiting for her to come back.  She's evil, but you're pulling for her anyway.
Fortunately, the parts of the movie where Uxia appears are those parts where the story most diverges from its source, so the viewer can be less distracted.  The way the movie played out (going into spoiler territory here), the face ripping, the impregnation by the camera-shy monster, the trail of human corpses, the incest, Uxia's peculiar anatomy -- all that just didn't seem to matter.  I wanted Uxia to have her way (even if her idea of the perfect mate left something to be desired).  In the end, because of the power of this character, ""Dagon"" is not so much an adaptation of ""The Shadow Over Innsmouth"" as a really twisted retelling of the movie ""Splash.""",1029801600,5,1572,4.916666666666667
1717806,3,B000067J0M,"There is one major problem with this movie.
Some have complained about the special effects, but to me that's eye candy.  And these looked realer than in some big budget block busters.  (The dark lighting of the movie helped alot)
Some have complained over the writing, especially the use of the F word.  But the main character is American, and...trust me, those words would be said.
The major problem is..the lead actor.  He, quite plainly, [is not good].  He can do anger seemingly well enough for this type of movie, but ask him to go beyond it and he seems to get a confused look on his face.
The smaller problem is the writing.  Most of it, I enjoyed surprisingly.  The thing is, as the actor has no reaction to some revelations (Whether true or false) the writer seems to write in no verbal reaction.
The genius of this movie is the little touches.  The things most people would not have put in.  This is why I give it 3 stars, instead of 2.
The no blinking, that makes a normal person blink more, is quite simply the thing I thought they'd forget.  The fact they don't overtly explain why they rip off faces, but let you see for yourself.
The ending is predictable, however, if you read Shadow over Innsmouth.  Sadly, if you haven't read Shadow over Innsmouth, the movie becomes far less enjoyable.  It's a very bad tradeoff.
If you're a fan of Lovecraft, but aren't uptight about having a 100% transfer from his stories, I say go ahead and rent this, and then decide for yourself if you want to buy it. ...If you aren't a fan of Lovecraft, or want a movie following one of his stories exactly, avoid at all costs.",1029283200,,1620,4.4358108108108105

other as a Lovecraft interpretation.  The moral, I guess:
beware credits that list unknown European actresses and

1717808,2,B000067J0M,"The cover of this DVD quotes Fangoria as saying this is Stuart Gordon's best film since The Re-Animator.  Absolutely not.  Gordon's second film, the gruesome, claustrophobic From Beyond, certainly craps all over Dagon, and even the slow-moving The Pit and the Pendulum is much, much stronger.

Dagon's biggest problem is its miserable acting.  Looking at the opening titles, I might guess this project was funded by sources in Spain and therefore most of the cast was Spanish.  Unfortunately, the actors are uniformly terrible: Raquel Merono as the screeching, annoying Barbara is just begging to be killed off right from the beginning; lead Ezra Godden tries to do the Jeffrey Combs kind of nerdy eccentric but just ends up flaccid and irritating...and for most of the film, we're following him around in his exploring- a-haunted-city shenanigans.  ""Sleep-inducing"" is not a term I'd apply to any Gordon film before this, but that's how I'd describe most of Dagon.  Dennis Paoli's screenplay really doesn't help the poor acting, with choice lines like, ""You f--king bastards"", ""You'll rot in f--king hell""...it's as if Paoli, who had co-written the excellent screenplays for The Re-Animator and From Beyond, suddenly discovered the F-word and applied it to every other line; matched with the clumsy English of the Spanish cast, it's even more nerve-grating.  As if that's not enough, you also get sprinklings of cheesy, fake-looking digital effects that simply serve to distract you from the film.

There are two saving graces to this film:  The cinematography is good, with the underwater finale (with a beautiful lamia) and the flame-lit sacrificial ritual being visual highlights, and there is some tension in the sacrifice scene despite the inherent unlikeability of the main characters.  The violence in Dagon is well executed, but with such grating central characters, it is nowhere near as involving as the gleeful absurdity of the violence in The Re-Animator nor the messy, disturbing apocalypse of From Beyond.

I wonder whether Gordon has lost his touch or whether he had artistic control wrested from him?  The beginning of this film is a long, arduous series of credits citing companies that seem to be digital-production and -effects entities.  Perhaps the investors interfered with the film?  At any rate, it's hard to believe this film came from the maker of The Re-Animator, one of the best horror films ever made.",1028678400,2,2431,5.181585677749361

1717811,4,B000067J0M,"First off, at least some of the hype was true: this is the most overtly Lovecraftian film ever made.  It nails HPL's obsessions one after another.  You got your fear and loathing of the sea and ocean life, foreigners and religion, miscegenation and sexuality, alien cultures and all things organic, including (ulp) ourselves.  It even does a decent job of conveying some of the weird awe Lovecraft could conjure up when dealing with cosmically alien plot elements.
The leading man will likely be seen as a liability by many of the film's viewers, but that is because he is the most Lovecraftian protagonist ever put on screen; he's weak, pale, neurotic and almost completely overwhelmed.  The acting is uniformly solid.  If you've seen the director's RE-ANIMATOR you have some idea of what Stuart Gordon can do, but where the earlier film is played like some outrageous cartoon, DAGON is played almost completely straight.
I feel the need to mention a couple of caveats.  This is a B-movie.  Was a time (not long ago) that I wouldn't feel the need to say anything about this, but here in the age of the blockbuster genre film with ""seamless special effects"" I guess some might feel cheated by anything less than an Industrial Light & Magic fireworks show.  This isn't it.  The film has atmosphere and suspense to burn, and the make up is excellent, but the CGI effects look just like CGI effects.
Also, although there really isn't that much violence in the film, when it does occur it is pretty hard to take.  There is one scene that is as grisly as anything I've seen in a movie, bad enough that I imagine it might make a good number of viewers actually turn it off.  Too bad, really.  The scene runs the risk of eclipsing the rest of the film and being the only thing people remember about it.
Although much has been made of how the story is not a direct adaptation of any of HPL's works, this is simply not true.  DAGON is 'Shadow Over Innsmouth'.  Expanded, relocated and updated, but it's 'Innsmouth' in every important detail and plot point.  Of course it's more lurid and in-your-face than HPL's stories ever were and makes absolutely explicit what he would merely suggest.  But if you can accept that I think you'll find this a pretty gripping film.
I say Check It Out.  It's not perfect, but it's an honest attempt to bring HPL's vision to life on  screen.",1028246400,180,2365,4.617224880382775

When their boat is damaged during a sudden gale, two vacationing couples have no choice but to seek help at a nearby and apparently deserted fishing town.  Things quickly get out of hand when the town's creepy inhabitants (Dagon-worshipping Deep Ones from the ocean depths) make known their taste for human sacrifice and human interbreeding.

With fairly grisly mutilation shots, nudity and language, ""Dagon"" has a cultish appeal, thanks in no small part to lead actor Ezra Godden in the role of the nerdy Paul Marsh, who is the audience's last link to the ""normal"" world before being completely engulfed by other-worldly insanity.
