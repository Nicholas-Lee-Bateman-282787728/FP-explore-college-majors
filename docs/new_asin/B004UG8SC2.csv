A young woman is so obsessed with owning an apartment with an ocean view that she will literally kill to get it.
It has lot's of flash backs that show us why she is so desperate to have this home and why it has to be on the water.

The lead actress does an amazing job of being vicious and sweet all at the same time.
It has the best gore effects I have seen since 'Laid to Rest'.There are so many creative and atmospheric kills that you don't have a chance to catch your breath in between although not overly done as to make it troma-esque.

There is also some heart involved in this film and at times you almost sympathize with the murderess.
The most brutal and horrific kill scene is the pregnant woman. I am a great lover of gore and slasher films but this kill made me uncomfortable and left me feeling violated myself.
All in all a very clever storyline with good acting and brutal,creative kills.",1319846400,,1002,4.296296296296297
