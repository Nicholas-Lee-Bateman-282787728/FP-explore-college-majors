If this is the same dvd then you will be buying a masterpiece. Gavito demonstrates that elegance & style, feeling and sincerity come before fancy steps, in Argentine Tango.
If you want a good book on tango but don't know which to choose, here is a superb listmania list of 25 tango books, on Amazon:

I bought and wasn't disappointed.  long beach ca.",1396396800,,341,3.898550724637681

8121597,5,B000FEVQ18,"Had I known, when I started in Tango, what a wonderful dancer Gavito was, I would have searched him out for a lesson or two. Since his death this is the next best thing: to see him talk about Tango and demonstrate his technique.",1387843200,,228,4.204545454545454

8121600,5,B000FEVQ18,"Please buy this dvd!  Gavito is a legend of tango who's dancing style was born out of the golden age tradition with just enough interesting additives from the late 60's when composers like Pugliese and Piazzola were making the music beautifully layered.  He teaches steps that I have never seen a teacher teach, which means they are usable at a milonga. Most teachers in my opinion teach performance tango and don't teach students how to move beautifully and connected to the music in their own space, with no intention of getting around the circle of dance as quickly as possible. You can languish in each step and if the milonga you are dancing at becomes congested you needn't worry about not moving forward.  You will be able to stay in your own circle and have the most beautiful time.  Not for the flashy minded tango dancer!  His moves are super subtle and the private conversation you will have with your partner in dancing will speak volumes-but only to you two.  If you look at his moves and his performance dancing it may not be thrilling to you(it is to me to the point of weeping and beaming)but when you do those steps he does it is very exciting.  Don't take my word!  Please buy this! Beginner or advanced!  It will change your tango life for the better forever.",1351296000,,1278,4.5701754385964914
8121601,5,B000FEVQ18,"Carlos Gavito is just uncomparable......but don't purchase this DVD to learn the basics of dancing tango, even though it is an instructional disc. This is a DVD for advanced dancers.
In order to learn and master these patterns you will already have to be a very good and accomplished tango dancer. Studying this movement is the equivalent of going for your Phd. in tango.
If you can understand and master this material you are really beginning to understand the finer points of lead and follow, as well as the dynamics of the movement. There are many things that can be explained, but going from explanation to application is a quantum leap.
For the ""newbee"" (less than 5 years experience), let this DVD inspire you as to what might be possible with the right instruction and hell of a lot of practice.
The dance demos before each section are a fantastic illustration of how to combine the sequences that follow in the instructional section. The performances at the end are ""Pure Gavito"".
Of course Gavito's skill is matched by the superb quality of his partner Marcela Duran. He would not look as good without her. Gavito's tango movement has a very ballistic quality and Marcela's excellent technique and physical strength enable her to be his perfect partner.
""It takes two to tango""....that is a fact and this couple is simlpy amazing.
So, as an experienced dancer this will take you to the next level and as a beginner this will inspire you as to the possibilities.",1344211200,6,1470,4.768627450980392
