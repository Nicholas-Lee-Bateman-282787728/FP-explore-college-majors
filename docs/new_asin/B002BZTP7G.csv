8362626,4,B002BZTP7G,"Michael Spinosa's Anna M burns with a quiet intensity,which seems fitting for a case study a la Freud on erotomania. We get a strong central performance from Isabelle Carre,as the young woman suffering the fatal delusion that the respectable doctor who treats her,Dr Zamefeski(Melki),is madly in love with her. A slow wave of infatuation becomes a monstrous tsunami of one-way unstoppable passion,wrecking everything in its path. The shy,hesitant girl spirals out of control.

Anna works as an ancient book-restorer in Bibliotheques National and leads a lonely,introverted life looking after her mother(Mnin).She appears to feint on her way out of the library. Later she places herself in the path of a car,shattering her femur. She gets physiotherapy from Dr Zamefeski,trying to accelerate meetings outside appointment times. She asks him to go for a coffee,sends him letters,makes phonecalls,steals his post,gives presents,takes photos. She phones the wife to say how her husband doesn't love her,its Anna he wants. She tells him he's caused her 'upheaval'.

Her married victim shows indifference,embarrassment,fear and anger in increasing degrees. The film is shot in muted colours in classical interiors,the environment suiting the heroine's moods. The film's subtitles describe the stages of the illness: 'illumination','hope','vexation' and `hatred'.The director's eye is detached, objective, focussing on the deranged woman not her victim. We never know what led to her initial suicidal action. She's dangerous and reads his rejections as further signals of his love. On the rebound she picks up a stranger and

crashes his van into the doctor's car and he beats her off. She reports him to the police. She gets even closer getting a job as a baby-sitter to the man upstairs. Her psychosis endangers the 2 baby girls,then she gains entry to his apartment and collects checkbooks,photos,mail, pours red cough mixture on the bed-sheets like blood. She also gets herself pregnant from a one night stand and hallucinates. She is committed to an asylum and appears to recover in 3 months. The psychiatrist seems to elicit her self-aware reflective contrition. Her recovery

takes her to a mountain retreat to be with her child and work-friend,Leonore. The ending is inspired,drawing a fascinating parallel between Anna's blind,obsessive,unreciprocated devotion and the irrational fervour inspired by religious faith. She also sees the victimised couple walking in the hills and her eyes light up. Cinematography is excellent by Duplantier from beautifully lit interiors to alienating shots,to film of lush open landscape.",1281916800,,2623,5.55
8362627,4,B002BZTP7G,"After attempting suicide, Anna is treated by doctor Andr Zanevsky with whom she then becomes obsessed. What begins as a crush spirals out of control into an obsession which consumes Anna, to the point where she will go to any lengths to have the attention of the man she believes is as in love with her as she is with him. The steady pace and down to earth depiction of Anna's obsessive behaviour is quite real, making it all the more disturbing. Aside from being an accurate portrayal of one woman's decline into delusional obsession, it is also a fairly accurate portrayal of how easily the victim of an obsessive stalker can be cast as the villain, receiving little help in dealing with a situation that threatens to destroy his life.",1259712000,,737,4.633587786259542
