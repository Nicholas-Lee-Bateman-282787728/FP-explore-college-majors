7498841,4,B017CGWKCU,I'm tired of the wwe Malik it hard for the next big thing. ROMAN REIGHNS,1453248000,,72,3.8666666666666667
7498842,4,B017CGWKCU,"Ladder Match: Tag Team Champions New Day vs. The Usos vs. Lucha Dragons - Xavier Woods was on commentary for the match featuring such highlights as teams performing aerial moves onto their opponents either individually or together, the ladder used to make regular moves & their signature maneuvers more impactful, Big E showcasing his strength, and one team constantly sacrificing themselves using the ladder including without a doubt the highlight moment of the night as you knew exactly where this was going when everyone went for ladders right at the bell as this was an insane ladder match with the different & innovative stunts performed with J.B.L. describing this perfectly, ""Someone call the sheriff, they just stole the show!""

Ryback vs. Rusev - This match got taken to the floor with the ringside environment coming into play in the opening minute as both men showcased their strength throughout the match with Ryback taking some high risk while Rusev worked over the neck area using whatever tactics he could to keep the advantage in an average big man match.

Chairs Match: United States Champion Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger - Both men went for the chairs & had a duel with them right at the opening start as we saw the chairs used in different ways on the floor from just bouncing their head off it to various chairshots to the back as they chairs were used in other unique ways such as to block or counter signature offense to just as a weapon to either launch or bury their opponents with along with both men using a chair in a way never seen before with their trademark offense in what was a good physical encounter.

Elimination Tables Match: Dudley Boyz, Tommy Dreamer, Rhyno vs. The Wyatt Family - This started out as a fight right away & continued that way throughout the entire contest with some highlights such as all four men fighting around ringside using weapons, one man being so dominate that he took out every member of the opposite team on his own causing the whole team to gang up on him at once, some men breaking the tables on their own or being buried underneath them, one man almost taking things too far, and the different ways bodies were put through tables including some that have never been seen before in what was a very entertaining brawl.

Intercontinental Champion Kevin Owens vs. Dean Ambrose - A rematch from the semi-finals of the WWE Championship tournament at Survivor Series as both men went back & forth early knocking each other down as delivering some heavy offense with the match being taken to the floor taking advantage of the environment as they continued to fight in the ring with different types of offense from jabs & chops to a clothesline that turned his opponent inside out with both men coming off the top at some point in a very good back & forth match.

Divas Champion Charlotte vs. Paige - Ric Flair was in her daughter's corner as both women took the fight to each other while playing mind games mocking each other while Charlotte had a moment that made everyone go ""like father, like daughter"" as both women traded momentum working over the head & neck area including both landing their opponent directly on their head while Ric was outside making his presence known in a competitive encounter telling a good story but a step down from their previous PPV match.

T.L.C. Match: WWE Champion Sheamus vs. Roman Reigns - This match started off with a bang like a recently UFC fight while both were trading physical strikes & brawling on the floor including one man thrown over the barricade landing head first to the stage area & back to ringside with all the weapons being used that they could get their hands on to either beat on or put their opponent through on multiple occasions to the point where one man couldn't believe that his opponent he kept getting him up & fighting back although he's clearly showing signs of the effect the beating has taken on him in what was a very physical encounter not only during the match but also during the aftermath that not only left highly visible bruising but one man receiving such a beating that he had to be stretchered out of the arena.

The kickoff match was Sasha Banks vs. Becky Lynch.  T.L.C. is one of my favorite PPV's of the year because of the different types of matches as this was no exception as there wasn't a bad match on here with the stipulations allowing some contest to be better than they would have been in a regular match so this was one of the standout events of the year that I would check out.",1451692800,,4535,4.617866004962779
7498843,5,B017CGWKCU,"It gets a 7 out of 10 from me.

 What this show proved is that WWEs roster is full of great talent even with all the injuries they are dealing with right now. There were some really good matches on this show. People complain about the storylines like I do all the time, but the in-ring action is pretty good.

 As I mentioned in writing about the main event, that was the best booking of Reigns this year. All you have to do is make him look like a badass that isn't out there making jokes or saying nursery rhymes. Just have him destroy people. The fans will cheer for that as they did here when he beat up Triple H. It was easy to sympathize with him because he was screwed out of the WWE Title.

 It was a predictable show where I got every match right except the IC Title match. Ambrose was the only babyface that won a match since I don't consider Charlotte to be a face anymore. Im still not sure if that was the best booking move because of how much I enjoyed Owens as IC Champ, but I guess they needed to have a babyface win something.

 I loved that tag title ladder match and thought it was the best match on the show. There were a lot of great spots, some believable near win moments that sometimes don't happen in ladder matches and all three teams looked awesome after it was over. Kalistos spot on Jey Uso was the highlight of the show. I hope everybody is okay.

 This wasn't the most memorable PPV event in terms of great matches or moments because it was very predictable. However, the WWE roster deserves credit for putting on entertaining matches. I wasn't bored during the show like I am with some other PPVs, so thats a positive in my eyes.",1450137600,,1661,4.227848101265823
7498844,4,B017CGWKCU,"On the 2nd day of Christmas 2015 I'm going to review...WWE TLC 2015. The Tag Team Title Ladder Match: The New Days Big E & Kofi Kingston  vs. Lucha Dragons vs. The Usos was an awesome ladder match with some really innovative spots and that big move by Kalisto stealing the show. Its not easy doing new things in ladder matches because weve seen so many of them in the last 20 years, but these six athletes found a way and came up with some really unique spots. The advantage of tag team ladder matches is they could do team moves that really differentiate it from a singles match and thats what I liked about it. They were very creative from start to finish. It was a nearly 20 minute ladder match that was never boring. As for the result, its not surprise that New Day won and that Woods would interfere. As he said its no DQ so theres nothing that could be done to stop it. It gives the heel champions a win that isn't clean and will lead to more matches against these teams, which is perfectly fine with me. The New Day should be the champs for the long term, so Im glad they are still holding the gold. A four star match to open a PPV is always a strong way to start the show. Great job guys. The Rusev vs. Ryback match was a solid match where they both tried hard, but its hard for them to have a really good match just based on their styles. Its just not that entertaining. The difference between Rusev now compared to last year is they are involving Lana in his matches a lot more. He used to win matches without her. Now hes winning match thanks to her interference. No surprise by the outcome. Ryback doesnt win feuds that often. Hes just there to put over heels. The United States Championship Chairs Match: Alberto Del Rio vs. Jack Swagger was a good effort by both guys in delivering an entertaining match. Its not an easy stipulation because there aren't a lot of chair matches, but they made it work. I liked some of the spots they did. At other times, it was boring because if a chair is so deadly why not use them even more than they did? They should have had Swagger use the chair to weaken the ankle of Del Rio to set up for his finish. I know its nitpcking, but they can use the chairs for more than just attacks to the ribs and the back. It was another obvious outcome since Swagger has barely been on television for most of 2015 and was just used in this feud to put Del Rio over. No sign of Zeb Colter either. The 8 Man Tag Team Elimination Tables Match: The Wyatt Family (Bray Wyatt, Luke Harper, Erick Rowan & Braun Strowman) vs. Team ECW (Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley, Rhyno & Tommy Dreamer) was he most predictable match on the show. The veterans were just there to put over the younger guys and there wasn't any question of it. The only question was how many members of The Wyatt Family would survive? It ended up being three Wyatt guys. I thought it might be just Wyatt and Strowman, but good for Harper surviving as well. It was a way to re-establish the Wyatt Family as a dominant group after they lost to Undertaker and Kane at Survivor Series last month. Give Bray and crew momentum for the Royal Rumble when they are in the ring at the same time. The Intercontinental Title: Kevin Owens vs. Dean Ambrose was another very good match from these two just like they did at Survivor Series. Im not sure if the crowd was ready for the title change. A longer match would have helped although its fair to say they made the most of the ten minutes they were given. Using a different move to win a title is good because that surprise element helps. Im surprised by the title change just because they really didn't build it up that well and I was hoping Owens would have a really long title win. Thats nothing against Ambrose because I like him a lot too. I just think they could have built it up to mean a lot more. Owens only had a two month title reign, so its a shame that it was so short. Ambrose is the only babyface to win a match so far, so maybe they did the change just to give a good guy the win. They put it over as a big moment too, which is great. The Divas Title: Charlotte vs. Paige match was a good match, but a weird dynamic since neither woman is really a face. It was hard for the crowd to really get into it. A cheap win for the champion that was a face and is in the midst of a heel turn. They wanted her to be this fighting, noble babyface champion and now she cheats all the time because the crowd didn't really care about Charlotte as a face. This will probably be best for Charlotte long term. I just think they should have done a better job of telling this transformation she has gone through. It looks like WWE is going to use Ric Flair as a heel manager for his daughter, which might be best for her. I just think WWE has to do a good job of building up divas as babyfaces because right now they don't have too many of them. The WWE World Heavyweight Championship Tables, Ladders & Chairs Match: Sheamus vs. Roman Reigns was a very entertaining WWE Title match by two guys that busted their ass to put on a show. I give them credit for working hard and coming up with some creative spots as well. That Samaon Drop through a ladder on the floor was pretty awesome. I think it went a little long because if they shaved off 7-10 minutes it would have helped a bit more. I understand wanting to go over 20 minutes for a main event, though. They told the story where they wanted to beat the other guy down to the point where they were too weak to climb. My biggest gripe is that the heels interfering was so obvious, yet Romans allies were nowhere to be seen. I guess Ambrose was celebrating while the Usos were hurt, but it makes the last three weeks pointless if his buddies aren't there to help him when he actually needs the help. I didn't expect Reigns to win the match and I didn't expect him to lose clean, so it was predictable in that sense. Ill remember it as a good match that was better than I expected it to be. I give this PPV a 7 out of 10.",1450137600,4,6003,4.17946505608283
7498845,3,B017CGWKCU,WWE has been struggling with their ratings for their prime shows now ppv are lacking excitement TLC is a great ppv last few years were awesome . This years not so if wwe wants to get return to greatness we need changes . sheamus vs roman reigns in a tlc for wwe world championship triple h wanted reign to be the new seth rollins and he refused and at survivor series he won the championship and triple h wanted to congratulate him only to do what he did to daniel bryan at summerslam but reign is smarter speared him to get caught by sheamus cashing in the money in the bank breifcase and he won leaving us to this now sheamus he's a great talent but a poor heel a better face has become a coward and a joke  formed a stable legions of nation with king barrett and rusev and alberto del rio a rip off of  the nation of dominaton to watch his back so with that I see a member trying to interfer in the match if roman gets the upperhand and sheamus wins oh hell no roman superman punches whoever tries to stop him and his team uso and dean help stop others from coming and reigns gets better of sheamus and wins wwe world championship finally come on he's no daniel bryan he's better. Then kevin owens vs dean ambrose for intercontental championship kevin has been far the worse champion in history in my book we need  dean to win to bring excitement back to that title if it stays with owens the championship will die with a boring wrestler with no personality. the new day vs uso vs dragon tlc match for tag team championship new day wins by cheating agian boring boo no dudleys the uso will win or dragon better than twerking new day . paige vs flair's girl for diva championship agian boo no sasha banks paige should win the championship for third time because flair daugther is ok champion but their better . the wyatts vs dudley boys table match really really dudley wins if not it's wyatts someone book this s*** wrong . united states championship should be on the line in a chair match alberto del rio vs jack swagger with jack swagger winning to refuel his lacking job in wwe we the people.  no undertaker and john cena and no cesaro and brock lesnar and rollins will be missed so this will be a poor ppv if the  authorities have the heels win except paige,1449360000,,2264,4.280373831775701

Spoilers

1.[TAG TITLE LADDR MATCH]NEW DAY VS LUCHA DRAGONS VS THE USOS-the night started off with the best match of the night. All three teams are amazing and are not afraid to steal the show any time, they do so here. The New Day is one of my all time favorite teams, they are so entertaining. So I loved it when Xavier Woods got on the commentary team for this match. There are many highlights as one would guess just given the nature of the match. But there is one moment in particular involving Kalisto that is great. Of course New Day retains thanks to involvement from Woods, New Day Rocks.

2. RYBACK VS RUSEV-this match basically was about Lana and her fake injuries at the accidental hands of Ryback. This was good for a power versus power match that was basically a brawl. Ryback retains after knocking Ryback out.

3.[US TITLE CHAIRS MATCH]ALBERTO DEL RIO VS JACK SWAGGER-this was a good match between the two. They have history as Zeb left Swagger at one point and was managing Del Rio for a while. This was a good back and forth match that would see Del Rio retain.

4.[TABLES ELIMINATION MATCH]THE WYATT FAMILY VS THE DUDLEY BOYZ, TOMMY DREAMER AND RHYNO-this was the match I was probably most looking forward to since it four of the guys I grew up with going against the brilliant Bray Wyatt and his family. This was one big brawl with weapons galore being used by everyone. There were many highlights and some great eliminations with the tables. I thought it was great in the end when they teased a flaming table and then didn't give it to the crowd, loved it. The Wyatts won of course since the ECW guys have been there putting people over to help the new generation.

5.[I-C TITLE]KEVIN OWENS VS DEAN AMBROSE-this could be the best match of the night depending on how much you enjoyed the opening bout for the tag titles. These two are excellent and always have great matches. This one is a great back and forth action packed match with both men nearly pulling out the win at various times. Ambrose would go on to win the title after countering the pop up power bomb.

6.[DIVAS TITLE]CHARLOTTE VS PAIGE-this was a really good match as well with both women looking good here. Charlotte of course was still flirting with becoming truly heel going into this match with Paige. Good back and forth with Paige nearly pulling it out, but Ric Flairs presence was a bit too much. After taking the padding off of a turnbuckle and slamming Paige head first into it Charlotte picks up the win.

7.[TLC WWE TITLE MATCH]SHEAMUS VS ROMAN REIGNS-this was a super fun and hard hitting match as I am sure you all know. The weapons used these two on each other and the hard hitting shots they took make this a great way to end the show. Both men battle hard in this one going all over the place and the League of Nations even interfere on behave of Sheamus. That of course leads to Sheamus retaining the belt but it is the after math that was excellent. Reigns goes crazy and eventually beats down Triple H who was trying to calm him down. It honestly felt real, he was a man who had enough of being screwed over and finally snapped. It still is one of Romans best moments, for a little while there the fans were actually with him.

This was a great event with every match being a really good to great match.",1464134400,,3322,4.432786885245902
