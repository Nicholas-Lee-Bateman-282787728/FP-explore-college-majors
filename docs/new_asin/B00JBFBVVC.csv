8653215,5,B00JBFBVVC,"Fun and nostalgic and not quite as corny as I remember from growing up.  Only real issue I have with Season 2 is that the last two part episodes are mislabeled and in the wrong order.  Also, many of the episodes in between are in the wrong order (but don't matter) but you can tell because Daisy goes between driving her yellow Road Runner and White Jeep.",1528070400,,355,4.2835820895522385

8653218,4,B00JBFBVVC,I've always loved this show but I'm disappointed that the episodes are not in order. In one episode daisy has her car the next one the jeep then back to the car. Then 2 episodes later it shows where she gets the jeep. Please make sure the order is right.,1526256000,4,254,4.1
8653219,2,B00JBFBVVC,"Liked this show when I  was a kid. It had its time and that's where it belongs--in the past. Just campy and not really that stimulating. Was good when it was on TV and you could burn up a half an hour between getting home from school and waiting for dinner to be ready, but not even the sight of Daisy strutting around is enough to get me to actually make a conscious effort to watch it. Had to leave a review because this kept coming up in my recommended TV shows.",1526083200,,465,4.054347826086956
8653220,5,B00JBFBVVC,J.D. Hogg is a perfect example of our political system on our planet. Love this show.,1525996800,,85,4.375

8653222,5,B00JBFBVVC,"I have bought all 5 seasons and the two reunion movies and they are all wonderful, family-oriented shows with good values and a G rating. Don't confuse this wonderful show with the terrible movie starring Burt Reynolds, Willie Nelson. Horrible, not ethical, not for kids, bad script, awful acting. So the 7 year series (1979-1985) is the only series that you should buy. The picture here is of the replacement Dukes, Byron Cherry (Coy Duke), Chip Mayer (Vance Duke), when John Schneider (Bo Duke) and Tom Wopat (Luke Duke) had a disagreement with WB. But the other seasons had John Schneider, Tom Wopat, Denver Pyle (Uncle Jesse), Catherine Bach (Daisy Duke), Sorrell Book (Boss Hogg), James Best (Rosco P. Coltrane), Sonny Shroyer (Enos Strate), Rick Hurst and Ben Jones (Cooter).",1525046400,,781,5.015384615384615
