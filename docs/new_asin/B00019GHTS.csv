1982566,1,B00019GHTS,"This DVD is a HUGE disapointment. Don't think for a second that this is a new release because it's not. This is an old Colloseum Video release from the early to mid 90's. There is no main feature like we've come to expect from WWE Home Video. The entire video consists of 5 matches.
Here they are:
Undertaker vs. Undertaker - While this was an interesting idea on paper, it ended up one of the most boring Undertaker matches ever.
Vs. Kwang - No comment.
Vs. Yokozuna - A decent enough fued but these guys move so slowly that it's very boring.
Vs. Jim ""the Anvil"" Neidhart - Are they serious?!
Vs. Jerry Lawler - Might be cool if you're a Lawler fan, which I am not.
All in all there are no video packages explaining what lead up to these ""classic"" matches and it just cuts from match to match with a small into from Ted Dibiase. That should give you an idea about the age of this release.
I really wonder what the heck they were thinking when they decided to re-release this garbage. Horrible waste of money, find ""This is My Yard"" on eBay instead.",1077148800,,1049,4.303030303030303

  v. Undertaker : the fake version from SummerSLam 94 which has to be the all time worst PPV main event from WWE ever.

  v. Kwang : a masked Savio Vega match from a very early RAW, not much here actually.
  v. Yokozuna : casket match II, the Survivor Series one featuring Chuck Norris. Pretty slow paced match.

HE BURIES THEM ALIVE

This is a nice little collection of matches that was originally released on VHS back in the day. It is hosted by ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase which is fitting since he originally brought him into the WWF.

1. VS UNDERTAKER-this was the match that happened at SummerSlam 1994 in which the real Taker had been out since The Royal Ruble earlier that year after a he lost to Yokozuna in a casket match. Later on ""The Million Dollar Man"" Ted Dibiase would debut his own Undertaker as part of his Million Dollar Corporation. Of course Paul Beaer said that he had the real Taker and would bring him back at SummerSlam, and he did. The fake Taker was portrayed by Brian Lee who you may remember from ECW and TNA, or maybe his second stint in the WWF as Chainz from the DOA. Any way the match does not last that long but it feels like it does. The match is a slow paced brawl like match as the both use the Undertaker style of attack. Storyline wise this was indeed huge, but match up wise it was a bit of a let down. The real Taker wins the match after a tombstone piledriver.

2. VS KWANG-the second match on this set was a match from Monday Night Raw pitting Taker against the masked Kwang. Kwang of course you would know mostly as Savio Vega, and also it is cool hearing Randy Savage on the commentary. This is actually a really good match from Raw that sees Kwang spitting both a red mist and a green mist at Taker. The funny thing is that Taker spit the green one back and nailed one ff his best choke slams ever. The action here was quick and made for an interesting match.

3. VS YOKOZUNA-this was their second casket match from that year with this one taking place at the Survivor Series 1994. This match also had Chuck Norris as the special enforcer. The match is going well until King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigalow come down to ringside. I must say Norris looks like a pimp standing in their way here. But it is a diversion letting I.R.S. come in and attacks the Undertaker. Still taker makes it out of the casket while Jeff Jarrett comes down only to be kicked by Norris. Taker ends up giving Yoko a kick to the face that sends him into the casket.

4. VS JIM ""THE ANVIL"" NEIDHART-this is a match from Superstars and is probably my favorite from the set. I still to this day think Neidhart could have been used so much better in the WWF even after the ""Screwjob"" in 97. Instead he was beaten down by D-X and cut after that, and even then he could have been used so much better [same for Davey and Bret] in WCW afterwards this is actually a very good match that sees Taker taking as much of a beating as he dishes out. Bearer brings a casket out to ringside while Jim has Owen Hart at his side. The match ends once The Anvil is knocked into the casket and he freaks out, he gets counted out in the process.

5. VS JERRY ""THE KING"" LAWLER-the final match here was a coliseum video exclusive and another casket match. The match sees Taker taking it to Lawler with Jerry getting in a few moments here and there. Still it is not enough of course as Jerry takes a tombstone and then goes to sleep in the casket.

This is a cool little collection that I do recommend, who doesn't love the Undertaker. It is a must own for any collector out there and honestly it can be found very cheap. I say pick it up if you can. Any collection would be missing out if they didn't have it.",1318723200,,3413,4.217457886676876
1982607,3,B00019GHTS,"This is an old Coliseum Video tape that WWE quietly released onto DVD a while back featuring matches from the Undertaker in the fall in 1994 with the tape hosted by ""Million $ Man"" Ted Dibiase.

vs. Undertaker - This was the return of the REAL Undertaker to the WWF after losing his casket match to Yokozuna at the Royal Rumble earlier in the year along with the debut of his purple look.  While Undertaker was gone, Ted Dibiase brought along another man that everyone assumed was Undertaker (played by Brian Lee...better known as Chainz of the group ""D.O.A."" later on in WWE), except Paul Bearer, leading to this clash.  The match itself wasn't much past brawling in the ring & around ringside with only the only highlights being the real Undertaker being able to counter all of the ""trademark"" moves done by the imposter only to do them himself, such as what we now know as ""Old School"" before ending the match with 3 tombstones.

vs. Kwang - Although Kwang was able to get a few shots here & there, this was all Undertaker to the point where Kwang used the mist on Taker only for Taker to throw it right back in his face.
[Best Of RAW: Seasons 1 & 2]

Casket Match vs. Yokozuna - Unlike their Royal Rumble match where it was just putting over a storyline, this was an actual match between the two. They had actor/martial artist Chuck Norris at ringside to prevent others from interfering like what happened at the Rumble but he didn't really do anything past kicking Jeff Jarrett in the chin. The match went well as Undertaker can bring out the best of the biggest men in this sport & this match was no exception. It's not a wrestling classic but it a good match to watch.

vs. Jim Niedhart - Owen Hart was at ringside for this match & was mostly dominate by Undertaker with Jim Niedhart able to get some impactful moves of his own such as a clothesline & powerslam & suplex only for Taker to keep getting up.  Paul Bearer brought the casket to ringside only for Anvil to fall into it & be completely creeped out to the point where he & Owen forgot about the match and just wanted to get away.

Casket Match vs. Jerry Lawler - We got an exclusive match for this tape with it being an extra special treat in being a casket match.  This was back when Jerry Lawler was the cowardly heel as he constantly kept trying to avoid Taker & had to constantly cheat in order to get an advantage which we saw here as he resorted to low blows & punches with objects in his hands but that was only temporary as this for the most part was another dominate victory by Undertaker.

In the end, this is a very cheap DVD but definitely worth going out of your way to see as it has two important matches in the career of Undertaker as far as his storylines & character goes that WWE has yet to release onto his match anthologies in the Yokozuna rematch & his return against Ted Dibiase's Undertaker so it's worth the cheap price you'll find this for just for those two matches alone.",1302048000,,2965,4.355072463768116
1982608,5,B00019GHTS,"I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A FAN OF THE UNDERTAKER. I'VE EVEN MET HIM AND OUTSIDE THE RING, HE'S VERY FRIENDLY. THIS DVD SHOWS THE EARLY BEGINNINGS OF THE UNDERTAKER BEFORE HE BECAME THE LEGEND THAT HE IS TODAY. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD",1297382400,,229,4.476190476190476
1982609,4,B00019GHTS,"Found this dvd at Walmart in the $5 dvd bin. So I got it, mainly because it had the classic battle of Undertaker vs Undertaker and his casket match with HOF Yonkzuna. I believe the other 3 matches were mostly ok. They could have had a buried alive match in there since it is called ""Undertaker: He Buries them alive"" but still a decent dvd.

Its hosted by the Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase...ok he appears 3 times. With some of Undertaker's matches in 94. There were were casket matche, a match had a casket near the end, 1 with a casket at the begining and 1 with none at all. The matches that are on the dvd are:

Undertaker vs Undertaker at Summerslam 94
Undertaker vs Kwang at Raw
Undertaker vs Yonkozuna in a casket match at Survivor Series 94
Undertaker vs Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart at Superstars
Undertaker vs Jerry ""The King"" Lawler in a Casket match during a Colleseum video exclusive.

This is the order the dvd is in, but its not in chronological order. If you want to watch it in chronological order. Then it is:

Undertaker vs Undertaker (August)
Undertaker vs Kwang at Raw (the night after the above)
Undertaker vs Jerry ""The King"" Lawler in a Casket match (September)
Undertaker vs Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart (November
Undertaker vs Yonkozuna in a casket match (November)

Pretty decent dvd, for the price. Its only 1 hour, and only 1 match was trimmed a bit and that was the Yonkozuna match. I would have excluded the matches with Kwang and Neidhart and replaced them with maybe Taker's Casket match with Shawn Michaels and the first Buried Alive match. I know the original was released before these matches but wwe could have made changes.

Get this for as cheap as you can because it is a bargain",1272412800,,1712,4.524271844660194
1982610,2,B00019GHTS,"The dvd starts off with Undertaker VS Undertaker from Summerslam 1994. The commentary is just plain stupid and so is this match, skip over this.

Ted DiBiase then narrates the dvd for some unknown reason.

VS Kwang: I love the Undertaker facing various big men in the early days and this match was decent. Kwang was Savio Vega, if anyone cared at all. Kwang doesnt put up much offense and Taker takes care of him real quick via choke slam after spitting mist back in his face, which didn't look that good.

VS Yokozuna in a Casket match from Survivor Series: A good match with Chuck Norris as a speical enforcer. Yokozuna does a good job at being scared of the casket.

VS Jim Neidhart with Owen Hart: This match and the next match seemed to be before Survivor Series with the casket being at ringside. I don't know why they put this out of order but then again, they just took random videos and slapped them onto dvd. This match was decent as Neidhart is scared of the casket, is closelined into one, and runs away.

VS Jerry Lawler: Undertaker puts Lawler away in a quick match and then is placed into the casket.

Overall, this dvd is not really worth it unless your a diehard Undertaker fan",1265587200,,1194,4.429223744292237

Undertaker vs Undertaker

Rate: 3

Alright match I like the beginning of Paul Bearer coming out bringing in the Real Undertaker. In case you don't know the fake Undertaker is Brain Lee aka Chainz from the D.O.A. Undertaker wins by three no wait four tombstones.

Winner: The Real Undertaker

Undertaker vs Kwang

Rate: 4

Kwanga aka Savio Vega takes on the man from the darkside on a espiode of Raw. Undertaker really gives it to Kwang and he even spits the mist back out to Kwang.

WInner: The Undertaker

Undertaker vs Yokozuna(RIP)-Casket Match

Rate: 5

This is my favorite match on the DVD and Yokozuna afarid of the casket. Chuck Noris is at ring side watching over to see if no one helps Yokozuna beat Taker. King Kong Bundy, Bam Bam Bigallow make a cameo along with ""King of the Moutain"" Jeff Jarret. Chuck Norris beats the hell out of Double J giving him a hard kick making him fall and going all the way backstage LOL. I.R.S also makes a cameo trying to screw the Undertaker from the casket match (This leads to there match at RR95) but Undertaker still is not defeated. Undertaker gives Yokozuna a hard kick to the chin and drives him into the casket.

Winner: The Undertaker

The Undertaker vs Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart

Rate: 4

Great match great to see Jim and Owen Hart (RIP) at one point of the match Paul Bearer brings the casket to the ring. When Jim lands on it he gets scared he leaves lol and gets counted out.

Winner: The Undertaker

The Undertaker vs Jerry ""The King"" Lawler-Casket Match

Rate: 5

Good Match this was back when The King was a heel commentary before he talk about puppies so much. This is another one of my favorite matches on this DVD. King tries to beat the Undertaker using a brass knuckle or something on his hand but Undertaker comes back and tombstones the king and puts him inside the casket.

Winner: The Undertaker

If your and Old School Undertaker fan you should pick this up I mean theres not a lot of matches but it is still good. I hope pretty soon a Undertaker Collection comes out on DVD with all of Undertaker classic matches and promos.",1099612800,,2392,4.465437788018433
1982632,3,B00019GHTS,"This DVD is, plain and simple, an Undertaker DVD. It's NOT a documentary, and by NO MEANS is it a ""best 'Taker matches ever"" DVD. What it is, however, is a remastered version of a 1994 VHS package. It features five of the Dead Man's matches from a very short period of time in 1994(it is so obvious that the matches were filmed only weeks apart from each other,they are shown in random order, aparently to fool the viewers!). These are the matches shown on the DVD:
*(Paul Bearer's)Undertaker vs.(Ted DiBiase's)Undertaker
  Depending on who you ask, this Match is one of the best(or worst) Of the real Undertaker's(the one accompanied by Bearer) life. I personally liked the match, but many didn't because of it's somewhat slow pace(if you don't like average-speed matches,this DVD is NOT FOR YOU. If you like break-neck-fast matches, go buy a Rey Mysterio DVD or somthing). It is a cool match, because these guys fight exactly like each other. Of course, the real Undertaker wins.
  Highlights of this match are:
*Vince McMahon and Jerry Lawler's commentary. This match is a now-rare chance to hear Vinnie Mac's commentary.
*The real 'Taker's entrance. Although it would probably look cheesy to today's audience, the Undertaker had the most frightening entrance of any wrestler ever. And Paul Bearer's theatrics don't stop it from being scary.
*Paul Bearer's acting. At one point of the match, Bearer tell's the Fakertaker ""It's OOOOOOOOOVER for you! It's ALLLLLLL OOOOOOOOVER for you!""
*The ending. The Uderfaker has the 'Taker upside-down for a Tombstone piledriver, but Taker, using sheer will-power, forces them to flip positions!
  The next match on the DVD is:
*Casket match:Yokozuna vs. Undertaker
  A quicker pace than the DoppleTaker match. Yoko seems to be more afraid of the casket than he is of Taker or his ""powers"".
  Match highlights include:
*The ending. Right before 'Taker closes the casket lid on Yoko, he takes the Japanese flag from Yoko's manager(whose name escapes me now)and breaks it in two.
*Chuck Norris. Hired as a special outside enforcer, Norris'importance in this match culminates when he kicks Jeff Jarret's teeth down his throat!
  The rest of the DVD is forgettable (unless you're an Owen Hart fan).",1086566400,,2234,5.024390243902439
1982633,3,B00019GHTS,"Contrary to what most people assume, this is not a brand-new release by the WWE. Rather, it's a 2003 re-release (on DVD) of a 1994 VHS tape of the same name. On this disc, hosted by Ted DiBiase, you'll find five of his 1994 matches, against the likes of The Underfaker, Kwang, Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart, Yokozuna, and Jerry ""The King"" Lawler. If you own this original release, I don't suggest you pick it up. It is absolutely no different than the original version. If you don't have it, however, you might as well get it. It's a very good buy for the Amazon price of $9.98.",1084492800,,573,4.364485981308412
1982634,5,B00019GHTS,"This DVD is a remastered release of an old VHS tape, or so I've heard. Included here are five matches, and although they aren't exactly classics (except Undertaker vs. Undertaker, perhaps), they do give you a taste of what the Old School Undertaker was all about. If you were a fan back when he was the Deadman and would like a dive down nostalgia lane, OR, if you enjoyed his recent return as the Deadman at WrestleMania XX and want more, then by all means pick this up. The Undertaker vs. The Undertaker is worth it alone.
My review for each match:
1) The Undertaker vs. The Undertaker: Wrestling-wise, this match is passable. Storyline-wise, this match is very good. The story behind this match is that the real Taker (with Paul Bearer) was put out of action by Yokozuna in a casket match, and disappeared for a couple of months as a result. Later, the Million Dollar Man claims that he'd found the Deadman, and eventually does bring him back to the then-WWF... only it was obvious that this new Taker was a fake. Paul Bearer retaliates and challenges Ted's Taker by offering to bring the REAL Taker back at Summerslam. Ted Dibiase and the Faker Taker accepts the challenge, and the rest is history (and on this disc).
2) The Undertaker vs. Kwang: I don't remember much about this guy, so I assume that this was just your average RAW match up. Kwang might remind you of today's Tajiri, though, with what his kicks and his mist. Wrestling-wise, it's a good filler type match.
3) The Undertaker vs. Yokozuna: The casket rematch of the original bout that put Undertaker out of action. In that match, Yoko gave Undertaker a beatdown, but couldn't put him into the casket for the win. Almost all of the heels backstage came out to help Yoko put Taker out of his misery, and they succeeded. Fast forward to Taker's return, and we have a rematch on our hands. Actor Chuck Norris makes a cameo in this match as Taker's enforcer, and his job is to make sure the heels don't come down to the ring and force history to repeat itself. Wrestling-wise, it's not bad, but not great either. The late Yokozuna does a good job of being terrified of the casket, so props (and RIP) to him.
4) The Undertaker vs. Jim ""The Anvil"" Neidhart: Another filler match. Match itself is OK, and the part at the end where Neidhart is knocked into the open casket is hilarious. Good to see the late Owen Hart again also (RIP). However, I have to wonder why this match was placed after the Taker/Yoko rematch, when it was obvious that that particular match took place after this one (the commentators mention about the ""upcoming casket match"" once or twice, and Owen himself states twice that Yoko was going to ""bury the Undertaker alive!""). Oh, well. No biggie.
5) The Undertaker vs. Jerry ""The King"" Lawler: Video/DVD exclusive. This match is short, but sweet. This is another casket match, and it's quite hilarious to see Lawler run around trying to avoid the inevitable. Lawler's cowardly expressions are priceless, and he makes this match a joy to see. Taker here is, of course, vintage Deadman.
There's a subtle but obvious theme to this disc... except for the Kwang bout, every match has had the Undertaker's casket appear, and three of them used to ""bury"" his opponents (vs. Faker Taker, vs. Yokozuna, vs. The King). I suppose this would be the reason why the then-WWF chose these particular matches. In anycase, at the very cheap price, this DVD is a must-buy if you're an Old School Taker fan.

Undertaker vs. Kwang is a decent match, but certainly doesn't belong on a highlight DVD.
Undertaker vs. Yokozuna is pretty much standard fare for the Undertaker, and fails to grab your interest.
Undertaker vs. The Anvil is a complete joke. The match ends in a countout! A complete waste of space. Undertaker vs. King was only on video, and is probably my favorite on the disc, although that isn't saying much. In summary, don't waste your money on this DVD.",1081814400,3,671,4.647058823529412
