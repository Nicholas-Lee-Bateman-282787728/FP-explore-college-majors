2731613,5,B000MGBSEO,"I gave this 5 stars because my 2.5 yo daughter is a Caillou fanatic and she loves it (I live with it).  This is a newer video *without* the puppets that every kid seems to hate, and a lot less of the whining found in older videos.  The episodes on this video are much more positive, constructive and creative than many others I have rented.  Much more like the episodes you would typically see on PBS now.  MUCH less of the bratty whiny Caillou you will find in older collections.  I bought this one after I rented it to make sure it was ok.",1188518400,94,541,4.163461538461538

2731627,5,B000MGBSEO,My 2 & 3 year old love Caillou.  This DVD keeps them glued to the TV so I know they love it.  I have not watched it so I cannot attest to the content but I chose this one based on the other reviews.,1388361600,,198,3.477272727272727
2731628,5,B000MGBSEO,my daughter loves this one not her fave but she still loved it it dose not have the puppets in it as well,1386201600,,105,3.608695652173913
2731629,5,B000MGBSEO,"Sweet Caillou ~ no hyper behavior or sound effects.  These episodes have nice, simple stories ~ a rare find.  Perfect for introducing toddlers to audio/video entertainment.",1369440000,,172,5.576923076923077
2731630,5,B000MGBSEO,"My opinion that Caillou is, for the most part, a whiney little brat is unfortunately greatly overshadowed by how much my son absolutely LOVES him. As a result we watch ALOT of Caillou. In fact that's pretty much all he wants to watch.....ever......all the time. But like alot of other kids he HATES the ones with puppets. Thankfully this is one of the maybe six or so available that DOES NOT HAVE PUPPETS. Besides being good just because of that fact, it has a few episodes that he really, really likes alot including the one where caillou paints, the one where he makes pizza with his friends, and the one where he makes a sun key holder thing for his mom at playschool. I would definitely recommend this dvd to anybody who likes caillou.....or anybody forced to watch it anyway!",1365465600,,780,4.578571428571428

2731632,4,B000MGBSEO,Bought this for my Grand daughter.  She's loves anythign Caillou.  Keeps her entertained for hours and it doesn't drive me crazy watching it with her.,1358812800,,150,4.96
2731633,5,B000MGBSEO,"I don't know about other kids but put Caillou on the television and she is in another world.  We call her name and she won't even acknowledge us.  So, in limited amounts of time its a great show for kids and somehow they become mesmerized by this little ""boy whos four"".",1358553600,,270,4.2745098039215685

2731655,5,B000MGBSEO,"One of my little ones favorite DVDs. The episodes are about Caillou helping his Mom, cooking with his friends, painting and other creatives things. No commercials except at beginning and a bit at the end. I think you can fast forward/skip them anyway.",1358380800,2,251,4.8604651162790695
2731656,5,B000MGBSEO,My daughter watches this video for hours. It is very appropiate for her age. All the video has a good quality and sound.,1358380800,,120,4.260869565217392
2731657,3,B000MGBSEO,"I haven't viewed video yet but the product is cheaper at walmart.com and you can ship for free to your local store.  I have found that Walmarts ship to store is cheaper on a lot of products.  Just a helpful hint for other parents of Caillou lovers.  Also, a lot of toy products were surprisingly cheaper at Toys R Us and Walmart.",1343779200,4,329,4.274193548387097
2731658,5,B000MGBSEO,"My daughter just happened to watch an episode of Caillou on ""Sprout TV"", which I love, and she loves even more! I know some people think Caillou is whinny and annoying BUT he teaches, kindness, manners, and a respect for his Mom and Dad. Good values to have come out of a cartoon instead of violence and fighting. My daughter ABSOLUTELY adores Caillou, and sings the intro song word for word and she's only 2! I would reccomend this to and child her age and younger.",1298073600,3,466,4.430232558139535
2731659,5,B000MGBSEO,"Just like the PBS show. Other complain about Cailou being whiney, but I found none of that in this DVD. Daughter loves it.",1285718400,2,122,4.3478260869565215
2731660,2,B000MGBSEO,My son loves Caillou but on getting this DVD I was totally dismayed to find that I cannot skip the previews of other shows at the beginning.  Don't like my son sitting through 5 minutes of commercials for other shows (which put unwanted ideas in his head!) and I don't like having to wait around to get the thing started when the menu finally appears.  Annoying!,1277942400,5,362,4.46969696969697

2731663,5,B000MGBSEO,My Children really loved this DVD.  It does not have the breaks in between each of the Caillou cartoons you know the ones with puppet show so this was really a nice DVD.,1264982400,,169,4.121212121212121
2731682,5,B000MGBSEO,"This DVD is great. Has a few commercials in the first 3 minutes of the dvd, but nothting but Caillou after that.  112 minutes of pure enjoyment for my 2 years old son.",1264550400,2,167,4.0606060606060606

2731684,2,B000MGBSEO,"The content of the video is ok, but the sound goes way down when the shows start. The previews are fine, but when Caillou actually starts the sound goes way down and you have to have the TV on full blast just to barely hear it!!!",1250640000,4,229,4.0
2731685,5,B000MGBSEO,my 3 year old daughter just started to watch caillou on sprout.  we bought this video and she loved it!!!  she loves all the episodes of caillou.  thank goodness!!!!! caillou is a good change from many other shows out there.  he is a lovely child that is kind to his little sister and children in his playschool.  he listens to his mother by saying ok mommy after the first request (i hope my daughter catches on hahaha!!!) he shows manners and respect.  i cant believe there are any bad reviews!!!,1248480000,4,498,4.477777777777778
2731686,5,B000MGBSEO,My son just loves Caillou and this video is great.  I especially like it because it doesn't have the short clips of the cat/bear/dinosaur in-between the cartoons.,1232150400,3,162,5.0
2731687,4,B000MGBSEO,"Our 18 mo old daughter loves Caillou, but hates the puppet shows in some Caillou TV and movies. We love this one because there are no puppet shows and the mini episodes in this DVD are entertaining for us too.",1221696000,6,209,4.25
2731688,1,B000MGBSEO,I don't think Caillou is a good role model for kids he is very disobiedent and bratty. Kids already have don't need extra help with that.,1202688000,2,137,4.3076923076923075
2731689,5,B000MGBSEO,"For the life of me, I'll never understand what it is about Caillou and the rest of his family that utterly transfixes my kids. He's a whiny, inexplicably chrome-domed little person who seems to crave attention all the time ... and yet, here I am, buying (and rating) his DVDs.

For pint-sized Caillou fans (and the moms and dads who have to listen to him), ""Caillou the Creative"" is actually a good buy. Gone -- thankfully -- are the mawkish puppet skits involving Cailluo's dog and dinosaur that always seemed to annoy my little guys. The episodes also feature a calmer, more mature Caillou who often tries to help his little sister and his folks. The noted demeanor change is a welcome relief, especially when the DVD gets played on an endless loop.",1200614400,46,751,4.646616541353383
