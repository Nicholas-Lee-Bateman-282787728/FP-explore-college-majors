8437938,5,B004Q5FZLO,"Five CLASSIC Stars! Captured in concert at Lincoln Center in New York in 1982, the legendary jazz trumpet icon Dizzy Gillespie assembled some of his friends who are among the greatest musicians in jazz history into one ""dream band"" assemblage that performs classic Gillespie compositions. Some of the musicians performing at the concert were Jon Hendricks, Milt Jackson, Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, Max Roach, Jon Faddis, Frank Foster, Pepper Adams, Candido, Paquito D'Rivera, arranger Chico O'Farrill, and many more. This is not the complete concert but many of the highlights. Plus there is some historical footage featuring Charlie Parker, Dizzy, and an enthusiastic Max Roach in a fiery 1940's quintet from the bebop era. The best of the best includes ""Manteca"", ""Lover Man"", both the classic Parker-Gillespie quintet and big band versions of ""Hot House"" and ""Tin Tin Deo"". 'This is a classic 'all-region' jazz DVD that is an upgraded version of the 1999 'region 1-limited' DVD, showing none of the previous disc's flaws  (the FBI warning is very fuzzy, but the picture is focused and in sync with the sound). Put this is a safe place. My Highest Recommendation. Five JAZZY Stars! (1 DVD disc, no insert, NTSC, Region 0, color for the concert, black and white for the 1940's quintet footage, 89 minutes)",1334102400,5,1307,5.079069767441861
