The acting was disgustingly bad, the premise was cliched and poorly implemented, the special effects were lacking or non-existent and the whole movie just screams of a ""creative"" team that had neither the talent nor the funding to make a decent movie. Everyone involved should be ashamed that they let something this terrible be attached to their names. This movie should not have been made in the first place. It is a waste of money and time, one of which I will hopefully be getting back. Simply piss-poor in every sense of the word.
I really wish that I could pay to erase this trash from my memory. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Please, stop making movies. No one will miss what you have done.",1424649600,,737,4.676923076923077
6509419,4,B00LXDQ8VI,"Let me start by saying this is not my usual genre of movie...  I was introduced to this film by a friend, and I thank him for it. It is a ""found footage"" horror film shot entirely with a flip cam which makes the quality of the film even more impressive,  The story line is something most of us can relate to, a group of friends cutting school looking for a place to hang out and party.  Unfortunately their final destination was exactly that...  The characters are developed just enough to grab you while simultaneously reminding you of that guy/girl you knew in High School. The acting by all was great, however I especially enjoyed Theresa Davis's performance as Claire, the nerdy side kick of the cool, hot chick.  When things go wrong for these five, they really go wrong...  and it is the realness created by how the movie is filmed that made it most frightening to me.  Again, I am not usually a horror movie fan, however I thoroughly enjoyed this film and highly recommend it.  Remember, just because the credits role, doesn't mean it's over.  Enjoy!",1422835200,2,1057,4.550264550264551

6509421,1,B00LXDQ8VI,"Warning: this is NOT a movie about a haunting!!!!!!!!!!! I got it for that reason only, and was extremely bummed and angry that the description of the movie says other wise. If you like a b/c slasher flick with more character build up and little action and no suspense and ok acting by a few and terrible acting by a few others, you might like this film, but I would wait for it to be on prime and DEFINITLY don't save it for your Friday night movie!",1422489600,,450,4.183908045977011
6509422,5,B00LXDQ8VI,"Found Footage Films are not well liked, anymore, thats a given. Actually, I didn't like Blair Witch, but I did like The Curse of The Blair Witch a great deal, maybe it was the Documentary feel to it. Im not sure if Play Hooky is a Found film or not. Maybe the filmmakers intent was to make it as Real Time as genuine as possible. Maybe its a Police Evidence Film and should have been stamped as such in some upper or lower corner. It doesnt have that usual flow of tension and suspense after the first eight to ten minutes that a Horror Film usually has. Its definitely not a Slasher Film, as the lack of bloody, violent scenes, until the last part of the film, proves it.
So what is it? Its character driven. It moves along with a Breakfast Club bunch of losers: Lance (Vincent Kulish) an apparent older high school dropout/pump-jockey, Brad (J. Wright Chester)  his younger geek-voiced cousin that has a Go-Pro in his hat, so we never see his face but the audience sees what he is looking at; Rosie (Kim Kleemichen) the pump-jockeys employers butch-femme biker babe daughter, and two Catholic school girls  Megan (Becky Byers)a sexy redhead with great legs and a nice booty, and Claire (Theresa Davis)her overweight goody-two-shoes toady; in other words, typical archetypes.
During the majority of Play Hooky, we are asked to play hooky with these five kids as they reveal their traits, oddities, wants, desires, fears and prejudices as their hopes to find a secluded place to party gets dashed again and again. So wait, so, is this a Drama about Teen Angst; nah, nothing anxious about wanting to get high and party without getting caught, right? Is it a Thriller; nothing thrilling happens until three quarters into the movie? So its a Drama, a Psychological Drama  well, again, nothing psycho happens until three quarters into the film, when the real Psycho Guy arrives.
According to the poster, its sexy  well not really, only when the sexy redhead and the biker babe make out, but even then thats underplayed with a sensuous and comedic overtone. Is there any gratuitous nudity; no again, just a skirt lift to reveal the words Play Hooky on the redheads booty, as seen in the poster. So, in other words, theres nothing blatant - no blatant blood, no blatant sex and no gratuitous violence or nudity. WTF?
Keep Calm and Grind On! The PollyGrind Underground Film Festival gave Play Hooky the Most Innovative Film award of 2012. So, according to them, its innovative  I guess thats the secret to unlock this movie, innovation. According to Chad Clinton Freeman (the big PollyGrind Dude) and found in his liner notes, he, too, groaned something to the effect of Oh no, not another found film, this is gonna suck! but something about Play Hooky drew him in, like it drew me in. He saw something different in Play Hooky; something truly original.
I took Freemans advice: I saw it more than once, and he was right. I liked it better the second time around. So, without the usual Found Film or Slasher Film or Horror Film expectations, during a second screening, I got involved with these kids. Personally, I didn't like these kids at all. Im surprised how callous and uncaring they are (except for Claire) maybe its a Connecticut thing, but despite their insensitivities to each other, I did get involved with them.
I let Play Hooky take me where it wanted to take me, and without any preconceived notions. Once these kids passed the proverbial point of no return, I watched each one of them drop their high school facades, and then, when trapped inside, face to face with violence and death, their true natures either rise-up and survive or crumple and perish. I was surprised to find myself engaged, entertained and, even though I already knew the ending, compelled. Taking me into the dark recesses of a deranged mind was even creepier the second time around.
So, a week later, I watched Play Hooky a third time, and turned on the Directors Commentary including some of the actors, the editor and with Chad Clinton Freeman skyped in from Las Vegas. This was not only fun, but it was very telling about the filmmakers personalities and creative process. I now know why Play Hooky got the Innovative Film award, and I agree with Freeman: shot in seven days after careful planning, improvised and with little money, it deserved it.
Play Hooky isn't for everyone. I think most horror movie lovers looking for blood & guts and tits & ass will dismiss it. But if you like independent films and filmmaking; if you can afford the DVD and want to see something different, something not so traditional, something off the beaten path with a touch of irony thats an award winner, give Play Hooky a try.",1422489600,3,4692,4.70316301703163
6509423,1,B00LXDQ8VI,"It's impressive that this was done with just a flip camera, and there are a few good bits, but that does not a movie make. There's a long, long build up where we're just basically checking for places for the five kids to party, and I suppose that's a kind of suspense, but because the intro already gave away that the movie takes place in an abandoned building, you already know that everything's going to be full. The characters don't do any favor to high school kids, and the menace at the end is just not menacing at all.",1421971200,,524,4.303030303030303
6509424,1,B00LXDQ8VI,"Despite the disclaimer at the intro that this film was the first release by __ company by first time director __ on no budget in seven days, and that is has the spirit of independent filmmaking, etc etc... this is just a bad film, by any standard. I do support and have seen a number of great c-movie, microbudget weekend shoot ""found footage"" horror films, and I encourage young and/or new filmmakers as they represent an important niche of the future of the horror film industry. Despite all that, nothing can save this one from just being a plain old stinker. Quite simply, it brings nothing ""new to the table"" (again, despite the intro commentary). Worst of all, there are simply zero scares, no slow build, no chills... it's really more what I'd describe as a final school project for a Filmmaking 101 community college course. The acting is - as you might expect from that description - terribly over the top and non-believable, making it impossible to suspend disbelief and enter the film itself. Sadly, too, they chose the most cliched setting and plot of the last 10 years: an abandoned insane asylum. Unfortunately, I was watching this on my Amazon Fire, which didn't offer a trailer - so, I took my chances based on the short plot description, paid for a rental, and hoped for the best - big mistake.

This video can be summed up in one word: wasteoftime.",1421107200,3,1366,4.644628099173554
6509425,4,B00LXDQ8VI,"SPOILER ALERT WITH THIS REVIEW

Play Hooky is about 5 teens who choose to do something they shouldnt. Bad decisions

are, of course as the recent TV commercial states, the staple of horror movies; this

one is on par with the classics. One classic that came to mind was Hitchcocks Psycho.

Instead of following just one person from the beginning of the film, as with Psychos

Marian Crane, we follow the path of these five. As with Marian in Psycho, once the

teens settle into their new but creepy surroundings, is where the action begins.

The five principals are the older boys, Lance the dropout (Vincent Kulish) and Brad (J.

Wright Chester), his snarky cousin with a Gopro camera hidden in his hat. Then theres

the girls (the subject matter of the Gopro) Rosie (Kim Kleemichen) the charismatically

tough chic from a trade school, Megan (Becky Byers) the saucy parochial school girl

and her nerdy, goody-two-shoes side-kick, Claire (Theresa Davis). Claire is thrown in

for laughs, opposite the two strong and very sexual women in the back seat of Lance and

Brads car.

What I found fun was how the characters change, some more than others, under the

pressures of the life and death situation that they find themselves in. Unusual for stock

characters earmarked for demise by the killer. I found these actors (who do look a

little older than seniors in high school-think Grease) under Frank S. Petrillis direction,

believable and first-rate.

The educated viewer knows this is a horror flick, actually a found footage film which is

either loved or hated by horror fans, and with that knowledge, the tension of what may

next happen, builds slowly. But, to balance out the slow build, when the action strikes, it

strikes hard with a quick, angry vengeance.

There are some good twists in the suspense of the film, too, unpredictably taking the

viewer one way and then another. Also unpredictable, but enjoyable, is the epilogue,

directly after the final credits, that actually extends the reality of this found footage film;

so sit through the credits and watch it.

The horror genre can be predictable, even more so with found footage films, but its the

concept of the hidden Gopro in the hat, little twists in the plot and in-depth character

changes that make the trip all the more fun in Play Hooky.",1415059200,2,2321,4.819796954314721

8668741,4,B00LXDQ8VI,"I liked it very much! If it was scripted the actors did one heck of a job making it seem conversational. If there was just a direction to go in and bullet-points were to be hit and they just ad-libbed everything, even more impressive. The scene in the attic was especially freaky!!  My favorite part had to be the end (after the credits?, I don't quite remember) with (I think) Bob. In what I do there are TONS of post-apocalyptic stories out there; authors have to constantly come up with new angles to keep it fresh. Same thing with found footage films. Play Hooky kept it fresh. It's a genre that can go wrong very easily (in my opinion), but not so here. And just like a Disney film it's great for all ages! LOL! Seriously though. It's perfect for high schoolers because, duh. It's great for college age because they all wish they were back in high school. And it's great for us older folks because it brings back memories of skipping school. The ride in the car down the street after they all meet up reminded me of many times a guy from work and I went driving around Pound Ridge to find all these haunted houses, cemeteries in the woods, satanic cult houses, and other stuff. The natural lighting in that scene was eerily reminiscent as a matter of fact.",1488240000,,1261,4.412017167381975

8668748,4,B00LXDQ8VI,"I liked Play Hooky. It really felt as if you were watching a clip on 48 Hours or Cold Case Files or some crime documentary. As with these crime shows on TV, you know its going to end up in murder, but unlike them, you got to know the victims first hand. It was entertaining. Megan and Claire were really good actresses. Sometimes it dragged like real life videos, but it was funny sometimes, until the end. What I did not like was, at the end when the camera died, they showed this slick summary of events thing set to music. It was like something from a music video. It was well done, but it took me away from the in-reality video feel of the movie. After the closing credits, there was an interview scene with one of the characters that was also really good. It felt like it was a real video again, but a lot of people are going to miss it. The actor was really good. They should have put this interview scene after the camera died and left the music video scene until after the credits.
