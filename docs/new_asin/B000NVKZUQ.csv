2785690,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I had a pretty difficult pregnancy (including very bad ligament problems = problems walking etc) and I also had a c-section. Before my pregnancy I had a personal trainer and was quite fit but due to my difficult pregnancy I could not exercise much. I found that this dvd is perfect for me, as the exercises are very gentle (including light abs), and you can really take your time doing them. This is not for those of you that are looking to lose a lot of weight fast but for those of you that want to ease back into exercising after pregnancy, and I would especially recommend this to those of you that have had ligament problems and pains or for other reasons are not strong enough to go back to ""regular exercise"" (even brisk walking) yet.

I found that the instructor is very comfortable and soothing to listen to, and after feeling that I would never be able to exercise again (my doctor said all I can do is moderate walking and gentle exercise!) due to the pain I was so pleased to find this. After using this for only a few weeks I already feel stronger, and it doesn't hurt to do these exercises! Surely this is not a dvd to lose the pounds, but to strenghten your muscles again, and it has also helped me to gain confidence that I can get back in shape again. It is exactly what the title says -postnatal rescue.",1222646400,2,1321,4.326612903225806
2785691,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This DVD has been wonderful and inspirational for reteaching and building the muscles back u[ after birth. It makes you feel good, and the 15 minute intervals are perfect when you've got a newborn and not much time.",1220659200,,215,4.684210526315789
2785692,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I forgot I had bought this DVD and started using it about 6 weeks after having had a c-section, and by that time I was pretty much able to skip right to the second workout of the three. (There was also some bonus stretching material for very soon post-partum, which I would have liked to have tried sooner.) While the three workouts seem a bit repetitive in parts, they go by quickly, and soon after you begin you feel as if you're done. I liked the idea of easing back into exercise and not attempting sit-ups or crunches right away, and this workout gave me the confidence to do that and not worry about injuring myself. The instructor has a little bit of a ""I know it's hard but it's necessary"" tone which can be annoying at times, but overall she's got a nice, motivational approach. The (very short) cameo at the end by her husband James Denton (from Desperate Housewives) is cute, as you see her interact a bit with her own family. I used this DVD for about 6 weeks, at which time i got back to my regular crunches and such.",1214352000,27,1030,4.314432989690721
2785693,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This is my 6th pregnancy that I am recovering from and this video has been a great help.  Erin OBrien gives simple explanations for each movement/exercise used. She explains the ""whys"" about what a postpartum body is going through and shows sincere concern about her postpartum audience.  There are 3 15 minute exercise progressions- completely doable and enjoyable, plus she gives a couple of simple straightfoward tips in each section re: diet and cardio. She also includes stretches you can do beginning the day you return home (which feel so good when you feel so wrecked from pregnancy.) This would make a great gift to a expecting or new mom!",1203206400,29,648,4.881818181818182
2785724,5,B000NVKZUQ,this exercise routine saved me after 2 babies. Erin is great & it feels like you are working through things with a trusted friend. I swear that with both recoveries (C-sections) this routine helped me rehab my abs & back whereas I otherwise might have hurt myself or had other new mom post baby issues (hello sneeze & pee! or diastasis recti) & needed PT or more. But I didn't & I swear this video helped. you can do the exercises while laying on the floor with a newborn & the progressions make sense & WORK for a new mom body. HIGHLY recommend for all new moms,1432771200,,562,4.261682242990654
2785725,4,B000NVKZUQ,A little cheesy and very low production quality but it's a safe postnatal routine and about as challenging as you want it to be when you're about 2-4 weeks pp.,1431734400,,159,4.333333333333333
2785726,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I love this DVD. I started it 3 weeks postpartum. I was actually surprised at how weak I had gotten being pregnant, so it was nice to be able to stretch and go slow with the DVD. As you get stronger, the DVD can progress with you. Highly recommend!",1427155200,,248,4.081632653061225
2785727,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I am recovering from my third c-section. I'm not really overweight, but I am very out of shape. This video progresses slowly through ""3 progressions"", which you can move through at your own pace. I like Erin, minus an obnoxious lecture on eating habits. I think anyone going to the trouble to buy a workout video is probably also eating fairly well without her admonishment. The exercises are easy to follow, and I love the 15 minute limit; That's about all I can manage with three other little kids and a newborn. This is not aerobic, and it is not excruciatingly difficult. It is simply muscle building and recovery.  Very happy with my purchase.",1423612800,,648,4.684210526315789
2785728,5,B000NVKZUQ,Perfect way to ease back into Pilates after vaginal birth.,1415577600,,58,4.9
2785729,5,B000NVKZUQ,"Awesome workout, it gives three gradual workouts. Works and stretches all the areas that my postpartum body needs!",1411689600,,114,5.388888888888889
2785730,5,B000NVKZUQ,"6 months later, I still LOVE it. Everything she says resonates to me: My body understands what it should do and shouldn't do.",1408838400,,125,4.478260869565218
2785731,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I love this, it's short & very basic core work to help regain strength post-baby. The first level is very, very easy...but don't be mislead it gets harder. I'm still on the second level & will move on to the third once I feel I've mastered these skills. I was pretty in-shape pre-baby, but being pregnant does a number on your core. The short duration is also great because it's about the length of time that baby will play by himself before needing something. I would recommend this to a friend.",1404172800,,496,4.461538461538462
2785732,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I've only just started this video (am on progression 1).  The exercises seemed fairly easy, so at first was disappointed until the second day, then I could feel some soreness in the pelvic area which I assume is from the exercises.  I agree with some of the previous comments that this isn't a strenuous workout.  But it works for me because but I was placed on bed-rest for the last trimester of my pregnancy and had a difficult post-delivery issue that left me feeling like I'd been punched hard in that area.  The instructor (Erin) has a nice soother voice and encouraging tone which I need during this time.",1390435200,2,611,4.577981651376147
2785733,5,B000NVKZUQ,I bought this after having my baby but I still continue to use it years later.  Its not a workout to lose weight but it just makes you feel good.  She works every part of your body just a little bit and I love the stretches.  Thanks Erin!,1388880000,2,238,3.9166666666666665
2785770,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This DVD got me back on track when I needed it most.  She doesn't give amount of time to do each part but I did two weeks of each: the stretching, and then the three levels for a total of eight weeks.  Thank you very much Erin!!",1385510400,2,228,3.8297872340425534
2785771,5,B000NVKZUQ,I did this DVD four weeks after having my second child and it is just what I needed to get eased back into exercise. The progressions are the right length for a mom with a newborn. There are a few minutes of discussion and then around 15 mintues of workout. I did each progression for a week or two before going to the next one. I think Erin's disposition is warm but challenging and not too annoying. I actually found out that I really like pilates based exercise because of this DVD. I will recommend this to all of my friends that are new moms. You just can't go wrong with it.,1380412800,3,580,4.1875
2785772,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This DVD is the perfect start to rehabilitating the body after pregnancy and birth. Erin is encouraging, and I know I'm stronger (and getting stronger) from these exercises!",1378252800,,173,5.214285714285714
2785773,1,B000NVKZUQ,"I wish I could return this video. I assumed that since this was geared to postnatal women that it would be sensitive to the issue of abdominal diastasis (which most women have post pregnancy to some degree). Nope. The second ""progression"" has you doing Pilates 100's which are one of the WORST things to do and can cause more damage. The workouts are very simplistic and I could find better for free on tv. Some of the stretches feel good but other than that this is a total waste. SKIP!!!",1377561600,13,489,4.444444444444445
2785774,5,B000NVKZUQ,"Love this dvd. With having a c-section and still feeling sore even after 10 months when I work out, put a damper on me getting back into my pre-baby body. Not with this! She helps you strengthen your muscles around your tummy and other areas from having to carrying that extra weight for those 9 months. However her ""words of encouragement"" are slightly annoying, but nevertheless very helpful.",1377302400,,394,4.8088235294117645
2785775,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I gave birth to my second child last week, in a relatively short and uncomplicated vaginal birth. I exercised regularly throughout my pregnancy and was very active before pregnancy as well. I found the first progression to be a good warm up, and the second progression to be the right challenge level for me at 1 week post partum. The third progression may take me a week or two to build up to. Even though the video says not to begin before 6 weeks post partum, I think you can start earlier if you have been exercising regularly. I plan to use this exercise series to get my muscle tone back over the first few months and then move on to more challenging workouts.",1376956800,3,666,4.379032258064516
2785776,3,B000NVKZUQ,"I thought I would be able to start this program right away, but it was still suggested to wait the six weeks.  I was pretty disappointed.  There are some very simple, low key stretches and stuff that you can do, but I was hoping for more.
Once I started the program I was wishing it was more intense.  The leg exercises are good though :-)  I was just wanted more I guess.  But I may have been overzealous.
But this would probably be a great DVD for others who weren't trying to over do it.  Each segment is pretty short, about 15 minutes.",1376784000,2,539,4.184466019417476
2785777,5,B000NVKZUQ,"i'm so glad i found this DVD! i initially was just going to buy tracy anderson's post-pregnancy dvd, but i'm so happy i read about this one first. it's the perfect early postnatal DVD. i started doing progression one before i had my six week doctor's appointment, but it was very gentle, and a nice way to feel like i was doing *something* about my mushy abs without being very strenuous. it's pilates-inspired. i also have had residual physical problems after my delivery that necessitated going to a chiropractor, and this DVD didn't feel like it would push the envelope so much that i would injure myself or set back my recovery.
i definitely feel much stronger after doing this.
other things to note..
-the 15 minute time length is, IMO, *perfect* for when you have a young infant. there's actually a chance you can get it in every day! 45 minute long DVDs, not so much..those take me almost all day to do.
-i love that Erin does the routine just on the carpet in her living room. it makes it feel very manageable and approachable.
-follow the progressions and don't be tempted to skip ahead. i tried progression 3 because i was getting bored, but i'm honestly not ready for it yet. it requires significant core strength, IMO.
-Erin's lecture at the beginning of progression 2 on healthy eating is pointless and annoying. you're not going to get skinny on 15 minutes a day here.. the point of his DVD to me is to turn my mushy core strong enough that i can carry my son without pain.
-there's no arm work here, unless you count push-ups. the majority is abs and legs.

my recommendation is to master progression 3 before you move on to tracy anderson. only at that point will your core be strong enough to do her DVD.",1376092800,13,1721,4.498402555910543
2785778,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I am a new mother recovering from a cesarean  and needed something with a reasonable workout routine to make me feel better...This video is great for that! I've been told to slowly ease back into working out.  One day, I will work my way back up to my past workout regimen, but until then, this does the trick.  The instructor is great at giving little pep talks about post-partum mental health, rest and nutrition. Over all, it is great for beginners after birth.",1375228800,2,464,4.566265060240964
2785779,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I honestly believe this is because of the calories I burn breast feeding and this video. Just being able to exercise makes my day SOO much better. It's gentle, it's totally feasible for a new mom, just 15 minutes. Feels SOO good to use muscles I haven't in such a long time. I'm a huge fan of this video! I can feel my stomach muscles coming in, definitely enjoying the journey of winning my body back.",1374969600,3,402,4.302631578947368
2785809,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I really enjoy this workout. I like the three progressions of workouts. It helps me see how I really am getting stronger as I move to each new progression. Erin is encouraging, and she pushes you to keep going. I especially like that each progression is only 15 minutes. As a busy mom, it's the perfect length to ensure that I can actually do this workout every day.",1373241600,,366,4.397058823529412
2785810,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I've been using this video daily for a week & a half and am already seeing great results.  The exercises are concentrated on rebuilding muscles that have weakened during pregnancy and helping you get that tummy back in good shape. The 15-minute sessions make it very easy and convenient to squeeze into your day...especially with a new baby around.  I pretty quickly moved on to level 2 and 3 because I had been working out up until I delivered and found that level 1 wasn't quite challenging enough. (I started on 2 within a few days of being out of the hospital and level 3 a day after that).  However, I think level 1 would be very helpful for someone who had a c-section or a tougher delivery and needs more time to recover.  If I have enough time, I like to do both levels 2 & 3 for a 30-minute workout.  I would definitely recommend this for anyone trying to get a good dose of toning (in a convenient format) into their post-pregnancy workout plan.",1373241600,2,955,4.403409090909091
2785811,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I found this dvd while I was pregnant with my 5th baby. I wish I had had it after my first! As long as you listen to your body and be careful, not doing anything that doesn't feel right, you can start with the gentle stretches as soon as you get home from the hospital. I waited until four weeks to start the first level 15-minute workout. I felt like I could have started it sooner, but it felt so good to start working my muscles. I used each ""progression"" for only about a week or two, but it was the perfect way to get my body going again and ready to begin working out seriously. My baby is now 3 months old and I have been doing more difficult workouts for the last week or so. I would recommend this dvd to anyone for getting started working out (again) after having a baby.",1370476800,2,781,4.077922077922078
2785812,5,B000NVKZUQ,This was exactly what I needed to ease back into an exercise routine after my second C-section. The movements were simple and just challenging enough without being too tough and without bothering my incision,1369267200,,207,5.117647058823529
2785813,1,B000NVKZUQ,"I cannot view this product.  I just ordered the dvd because the video streaming keeps stopping and I have an excellent wi-fi connection.  I am so frustrated and will never use amazon video streaming again. I'm very upset I paid for it, and it doesn't even work.",1364688000,,261,4.531914893617022
2785814,3,B000NVKZUQ,"I thought I was going to need something very soft to begin my post pregnancy workouts since Ia had a csection but it turned out that I didn't really. At my 6 wk doc clearance, I did the first 2 groups of excercises once and then went up to the 3rd group. By the 4th day I was a little bored. Before my pregnancy i was an active person and enjoyed yoga, pilates, weights and dancing so this was slow for me. But if you wanna start slow, don't normally workout or had a difficult delivery then this might work best for you.",1361145600,19,521,4.067961165048544
2785815,5,B000NVKZUQ,"Helped me get back into the saddle of working out in a slow and steady way.
Highly recommend! I would highly recommend to anyone who just had a baby and was looking for a way to ramp back into an exercise routine.",1360886400,,213,4.095238095238095
2785816,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This DVD is fantastic. I had a Caesarean two months ago and have been doing this series since six weeks post-surgery. At first it looked terribly easy and (mostly) it felt it too. After a few days of sticking with it, I began to notice a HUGE difference in my muscle strength and structure. Although the exercises seemed simple and minimal, I realize now that Erin O'Brien really does mean that you need to re-train your muscles to fire properly and she is doing just that. While my abdominals are still very weak and puffed out, they are noticeably stronger and flatter. At this rate, they will be better than my pre-pregnancy abs! I highly recommend this video to anyone, even if it seems like the movements are too easy. It's about the muscle function, not just the challenge. The workouts are very short and I can usually fit them in with even the tiniest of my DD's cat-naps. My only criticism is that there is no stretching after the workout. There are a few moves within the series, but I found I needed to add a bit more after my workout just to address tightness from my pregnancy.",1358294400,4,1090,4.482412060301508
2785817,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I was looking for a post-natal focused video after having my second kid and was surprised that there was only one on here! Luckily it's awesome. Perfect way to ease back in, felt amazing and it is nice and short. Highly recommend it!",1357689600,,233,4.441860465116279
2785818,5,B000NVKZUQ,"Hands down the most practical (15 minute segments), effective, and realistic post birth DVD. Do this one first and move onto something like Tracey Anderson when you've really gotten your core strength back. I also love Erin--she is totally laid back and not all made up. She looks very real which I appreciate.",1347408000,3,310,4.867924528301887
2785849,5,B000NVKZUQ,"LOVE this workout.  I stayed in pretty good shape during my pregnancy - I did Erin's prenatal workout, yoga, and attended step and kick box classes at the gym up until 2 weeks before I delivered my son.
I couldn't stand the thought of not doing ANY exercise before the 6-week mark, and this workout was exactly what I needed.  I began the 1st progression a week after I gave birth and was amazed to discover how weak my abdominal muscles were.  Erin is extremely knowledgeable about your post-baby body, and gently conditions your muscles to regain their original function and strength.
It has been a month since I had my son and have advanced to the 3rd progression, which I faithfully do every day.  The workout has been so effective that my husband and I are planning a trip to the beach in a couple of weeks and I'm bringing my bikini - thank you, Erin!!!",1340064000,2,859,4.452229299363057
2785850,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I had two c-sections within 14 months of each other and my core was utterly destroyed. I had to start from scratch  because everything seemed to hurt. I found this DVD and it is amazing. It's helped me tremendously to ease back into exercise and I feel stronger each day. The DVD is progressive and includes three workouts that only take 15 min each. This is especially realistic since I have an 18 months old and 4 month old. The instructor, Erin, explains the ""why"" of each exercise which helps a lot. She's like my own personal trainer in my living room. She's sincere and encouraging. I LOVE this DVD!",1338163200,,605,4.5
2785851,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I really like the video, I rented it on the Amazon on demand so I could try it before I bought it.  I love that it is only 15min at a time.  I can do it twice a day while my 2 month old takes a nap.  I like that each progression builds upon the last so that you gradually get your muscles back in shape.  I gave it only 4 stars because I really don't like the artistic camera work, but I can get over that.  I like how she explains why shes having you do the moves.  My husband who is in the army even thought that the moves were good and liked how she explained it, (yes I had him watch it lol).  Overall I think it is a good dvd for moms.",1332979200,,640,3.661764705882353
2785852,5,B000NVKZUQ,This workout is a really great place to get started with working out again after delivery. The exercises Erin walks you through are especially designed to work the muscles which were hit the hardest by pregnancy.,1329868800,,212,4.916666666666667
2785853,5,B000NVKZUQ,This workout was just what I needed after my csection. It was gentle enough that you could workout without hurting your cut-up nerve endings and difficult enough that you could feel it working. Erin O'brien is super sweet too--she talks about being gentle on your body after child birth and taking it as slowly as you need to. She recognizes that your body isn't ready for a hard-core workout but at the same time doesn't make it too easy.,1311033600,5,439,4.569620253164557
2785854,5,B000NVKZUQ,I used her Prenatal workout which I LOVED because I was able to be more challenged than many of the prenatal workouts. I was already in great shape prior to getting pregnant and most prenatal workouts were way too easy. So I started her postnatal rescue (my mom purchased the boxed set with both pre and post natal workouts) and love it. Since I was in great shape throughout my pregnancy (and I believe I had a fantastic natural delivery due in part to Erin's DVD) the first progression was a bit easy. I started when my daughter turned 1 week old. Make sure your doc says it's okay. I was in great shape after labor and got the go-ahead from my doc. So I forced myself to do progression 1 to make sure I didn't over do it. I did that for a week and then was pleasantly surprised at the challenge I got in the second and even more in the third. I think it is a great graduated program. She makes it very clear what you can and can't do and encourages gradual healing. Highly recommended.,1303084800,4,988,4.232804232804233
2785855,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This DVD has 3 sets of short workouts, each about 15-20mins. Its basically the same workout, done in 3 increasingly difficult progressions. I had a hard time recovering from C-section and find this dvd very aptly named Postnatal RESCUE because RESCUE was what it did for me. Its more therapy than keep-fit, and this was very important for my recovery. I was able to move to the 2nd progression after a week of doing the first progression, and in a couple of weeks moved to the 3rd progression. I was stronger in a few weeks of doing this regularly, and ""got my body back"" in terms of its functions.
I like the trainer's attitude - genuine, sisterly, encouraging and caring. There was an air or quiet assurance about her tone and the dvd which I found comforting in those initial weeks when new motherhood was overwhelming and many didn't understand the pain I was experiencing in the simplest movements.
The duration of the workout was good - not too long and taxing. It fit well into the busy days of diaper changes and frequent breastfeeding.
I didn't need the DVD for very long (I think I used it for about two months or so) as I could then progress to the usual workouts I did before I became pregnant. I trust this trainer and just bought her latest Strong Body DVD.",1292457600,3,1271,4.5064935064935066
2785856,5,B000NVKZUQ,"Giving birth to my 1st child was a very painful experience.  I had a lot of tearing and couldn't sit comfortably for several months.  I liked this video for a few reasons: instructor seems very sincere and compassionate, the segments are short, the segments contain similar exercises that become harder as you become stronger, but what i liked most was that THERE WERE NO EXERCISES WHERE I HAD TO SIT ON MY BOTTOM!!!!  Sitting ""indian-style"" or on my sit-bones, etc. just was not possible for me after this labor so I was thankful that I could do every exercise in this video.  I was sadly disappointed to find some of the other well-rated videos had so many exercises that I couldn't do.

So, this video may not be challenging enough for the mother with an easy delivery and a boot camp attitude, but for those who have had a difficult labor or who want to GENTLY ease back into exercising, this is a WONDERFUL video!",1284854400,17,918,4.539393939393939
2785857,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I started this tape when my daughter was about 10 weeks old.  I wish I had started at about 2 weeks after giving birth.  If I had checked out the tape, I would have noticed that while it has three progressively harder routines that can be done after being cleared to work out , it also has a pseudo-hidden track - a stretching routine you can use even earlier.

I do this in my jammies, daily, but at all times of day, sometimes with spit-up on one shoulder, baby in tummy time on the floor next to me...and I love how it makes me feel strong again.  All the stretching really works out those postpartum aches and pains, plus the strengthening exercise add a manageable amount of oomph, helping to bring your core back to balance again to help avoid those same aches and pains!  After 8 weeks, my waist is coming back into focus, my abs aren't feeling so stretched out and my back stopped aching.

I admit, I do like workout tapes in general - the convenience of starting a workout within five minutes of deciding to work out just can't be beat for me.  Especially postpartum.  Something that can be done at home without much lead time or need for baby care was a must.

Also wonderful for this tape in particular: There isn't any equipment to get, you don't need to be in special clothes, you aren't doing anything that would be dangerous to do right next to baby since movements are controlled and slow (which, BTW, is still hard!).

Any improvements?  I'd love to see a baby incorporated into the routine.  I often play with her while I do this, lift her as a weight or to get kissed at the bottom of pushups, for example.  It helps keep her entertained, which then also gives me more chance to finish the tape!",1280275200,4,1714,4.369085173501578
2785858,3,B000NVKZUQ,Not as good as Erin Brien's prenatal DVD. It's good for someone who just had a baby. I find it too easy.,1271635200,,104,3.772727272727273
2785885,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I've done this video a few times.  My baby is 3 months old and I wish I would have had this sooner.  There are great exercises to do right after giving birth, even a c-section.",1265932800,,176,4.0
2785886,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I bought this DVD about 2 months after the birth of my 5th baby.  I have used it 4-5 times a week for the last 2 months and have seen some great results!  When I began using this workout I had been pretty sedentary since my baby's birth.  This DVD has 3 ""progressions"" to work through and I began with the first progression.  I only did that one a few times as it is very easy and intended more for the first month or so after baby.  So I moved up to the second progression and it was definitely challenging for me!  However, after a few weeks I felt MUCH stronger and more toned and could easily get through the workout so I moved to the 3rd and last progression.  I am about 4 months postpartum and my body is SO much stronger and more toned than before I started.  The 3rd progression has really gotten my abs, butt and thighs into shape and also toned my arms.  I am about ready to find a more rigorous workout now, but Postnatal Rescue really eased my way into life after baby.  I feel great!  I would recommend this for any new mom, but start it earlier than I did!  No later than 6 weeks postpartum to get the full benefits of the DVD.

I like that she also includes some ""Gentle First Stretches"" to do right after your baby is born up until you're ready to start exercising again.

Also, Erin is a good instructor and I personally enjoy her style.  My kids like her too.  :)  My two toddlers exercise along with me and my 10 year old daughter likes to repeat Erin's encouragements: ""Yes you can, you've got one more in you!""",1265760000,5,1532,4.174061433447099
2785887,5,B000NVKZUQ,This video has 3 progressions that actually build on one another.  I did part 1 from weeks 4-7 and am now on part 2.  I look forward to doing this every day.,1258416000,,157,3.875
2785888,4,B000NVKZUQ,"I did like this video.  It helped me get motivated to work-out again after baby.  Each session is short and the three sessions build on one another which is nice.  The instructor did not annoy me like in many work-out videos.
This video is toning only, we all know we must do some cardio to see the pounds really drop.  It's been 8 weeks since I had my baby and I now use this video on tired or really hectic days.",1252022400,2,414,4.074074074074074
2785889,4,B000NVKZUQ,I loved Erin O'Brien's prenatal video.  I should have started this way before 5 weeks; the 1st phase is a little easy for me.  I love Erin's videos-she makes me feel very competent.,1250467200,,181,4.454545454545454
2785890,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I am a male Personal Trainer that has a large clientele of females. Two of my clients became pregnant last year and they both asked me to keep training them throughout their pregnancy. I was a little apprehensive about that because of their condition. During their first trimester they both complained that I wasn't the same trainer, that I was being too easy on them. I was hesitant to push them like I did before. So I purchased Erin's DVD and watched it several times until I came up with a routine like hers. I appreciated the fact that Erin was about 9 months pregnant when she shot this DVD. They were both happy that it was challenging but not overly tough. I adjusted the intensity down as they got further along. I'm happy to say that one stayed with me for 8 months and the other for 7 months. Both babies' were healthy when they were born (however, one started crying when I held him and talked to him.  I think he recognized my voice from telling his mom to do one more rep).
I'm now using Erin's ""Postnatal exercise"" DVD and find it very informative for explaining to them that their body needs to go through rehab before we start the more intense exercises.  They both feel they are in better shape after these births than they were with their older children.
I would strongly recommend these DVD's to any expectant mother that wants to keep exercising through their pregnancy.",1249603200,29,1391,4.515873015873016
2785891,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I love Erin! I love her sweet, maternal, understanding, funny personality and it makes me keep doing the exercise. Love love love the streching section. Working out with her is fun, and I will buy her future dvd's eyes closed.",1247443200,,226,4.675
2785892,5,B000NVKZUQ,"This video is a great and convenient way to get back into shape after delivering a baby. I love how you only have to dedicate 15 minutes a day to workout, which is easy to squeeze in during a nap.",1243123200,,196,3.925
2785893,5,B000NVKZUQ,Love this video and do it at least every other day.  Only 15 min so I can get the whole thing done while my 3 mo old naps.  I started doing the video about 8 weeks after a csection for a breech baby. Before that I did exercises from the book Cesarean Recovery by Chrissie Gallagher-Mundy.  I love that its divided into 3 levels so you can work at your own pace.  I did the first level until my baby was 2.5 mo as I still had a lot of discomfort from my scar and didn't want to go to fast.  I love the stretches  for the back as my upper back is often sore from babywearing and the overhead stretches on the floor really helped to ease some of the discomfort from my newly larger breasts due to breastfeeding. I'm now on the second level and am seeing real results.  I love that she tells you to think like your body is in rehab and needs to be retrained.  I did alot of exercise before becoming pregnant and used her prenatal workout until I was about 8 mo pregnant.,1230768000,8,966,4.0473684210526315
2785894,5,B000NVKZUQ,I love this exercise video. There are three tiers so you can work out at whatever level you're at. Also I love Erin O'Brien's encouragement throughout the video. My husband thinks her talking is a bit excessive but he didn't just have a baby and isn't overwhelmed with how much work there is to do to get my body back in shape.,1229904000,,327,4.290322580645161

Its of course a little easier since i didn't just have my baby but its working jusy the same. After a week i can feel a diff in my abdomen. I highly recommend! Erin is great,1478822400,,317,3.676470588235294
8181912,5,B000NVKZUQ,"Oh, how I wish I knew about this 3 kids ago!!!

I picked up this DVD after baby 4, and I have to say this is seriously the BEST workout for a brand new mom during the postpartum period. Erin is so sweet and kind, and her moves are gentle and yet effective- this is perfection for the postnatal woman!

Stretching routine and 3 other workouts- each with increasing intensity, make this a really nice DVD that lasts. I like that the workouts are only about 15 minutes each- because I had no extra time for more- but with 15 minutes I could easily fit them in! Erin has a really sweet personality, and she almost felt more like a friend than an instructor.

This is a really wonderful gift for a baby shower or new mom- treat yourself!",1477267200,,732,4.251798561151079
8181913,5,B000NVKZUQ,"I've only been doing it for 3 days so I don't know how the results pan out yet. But as of now, I thought it was a little slow for me until I felt it in all the right places the next day. I have a 2 yr old and a 7 week old so this is a good workout for us out of shape mama's w no time. With my extra time I'm able to fit in some arm exercises for my bingo arms.

However, the third progression is a good moderate workout, and I have been doing it every day for quite a while and getting stronger. Combined with some minor cardio as she recommends, it's a good exercise plan, but I do wish there were a bit more variety or a step up workout after the third progression.",1437523200,,405,4.486486486486487
