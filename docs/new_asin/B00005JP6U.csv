1606278,5,B00005JP6U,"I have seen many hundreds of movies in my lifetime, and I must say, this is very close to being my favorite.

It is not a giant movie... it is a small documentary about one interesting subculture. While there are plenty

of famous people in the movie and that makes it more entertaining, the real heroes are ordinary people,

and the movie makes them all lovable when it could just as easily have mocked them. I am not

the least bit interested in doing crossword puzzles, but this movie is about a community,

both virtual and real, from all walks of life, that loves to do puzzles, and the movie made

me like *them*.

The movie uses brilliant visualizations to show puzzles being constructed and solved. Several

reviews in newspapers have mentioned the wonderful cover of a Talking Heads tune by Shawn

Colvin at a key point in the movie... I echo that. You will not be able to get it out of your head

after you see the movie.

I would not expect a documentary about crossword puzzles to make me laugh out loud and

cry in a theatre, but in fact it did both.",1160784000,21,1063,4.36734693877551
1606279,5,B00005JP6U,"Crossworders-quel subculture!  I had no idea that this world was out there, this competitive bunch of crossworders, but I must say that I am indeed a better person for now knowing!  The movie begins by introducing the audience to a group people who are the key players in an annual crossword competition held/hosted by Will Shortz, editor of the NYT crossword puzzle.  In following these different people (literally from all walks of life-a homosexual, a mid-west family man, a college student, a single female) the audience almost becomes a part of their group.  It was absolutely warming, to say the least (Ellen Ripstein has got to be one of my all-time favorite characters!).  Oddly enough, rules of the crossword puzzle are given, and the difficult nature of actually solving one, especially the NYT, is revealed.  After leaving the theatre I was determined to solve one (I am embarrassed to say that I started small and have finally solved a Monday puzzle, and am coming close to a Tuesday!  It really is a new way of thinking!); it has been a really long road!  Aside from being really well made, Wordplay was also salted with cameos from icons of American society such as Bill Clinton, Ken Burns and Jon Stewart.  To watch them work on these puzzles was great-as well as putting their pants on one leg at a time, they (sometimes) struggle with the crossword puzzle too!

What a great documentary, and how fun to watch.  In an age of vulgar and ridiculous entertainment, there is a shining example of entertainment revolving around a group of inteligensia.  Bravo, and two enthusiastic thumbs up!",1159142400,22,1603,4.831501831501831
1606280,4,B00005JP6U,"For me, crossword puzzles have been a casual thing, I might find one in the airline magazine on a flight and work on it to pass the time or my wife, who is a much more avid fan, might have left a partially finished one about, which I will pick up and see if I can find some answers.

Those who appear in this movie find crossword puzzles to be anything but casual. And this is not about just any crossword puzzle. This is the ""gold standard."" The NYT crossword puzzle. You may genuflect if you wish.

As the movie unfolds we hear how the NYT graduates the difficulty of its puzzles from Monday to Sunday. We learn how they are constructed, how they are made more difficult, what the rules of puzzle building are and how crossword puzzles infect and afflict those who are addicted to them. Celebrities from Ken Burns to Jon Stweart are utilized in cameo pieces, some of which are very entertaining.

This all culminates in the Marriott Hotel in Stamford, CT where the World Crossword Puzzle Championship takes place every year in March. We meet some of the contestants, we are shown how the tournament is organized and the friendships it has engendered during the years it has been held and as the days pass we get to the ""A"" finals where three finalists try to solve a puzzle against time on large easels set up at the front of the room which will really draws you in to the genre.

Whether crossword puzzles are your thing or not, this is an entertaining and interesting movie to see. It did not encourage me to increase my crossword puzzle activity, but it sure gave me a deeper appreciation of what those who are hooked on it go through. There is something in this movie for everyone.",1155340800,42,1687,4.432258064516129
1606281,4,B00005JP6U,"I just returned from seeing this movie at the theatre and was so impressed I wanted to find out more. Unfortunately I see there is no soundtrack available, but I'm hoping that will change, because the music used in the movie was one of the most touching and memorable aspects. Yet, WORDS are the true star of this film, and it was heartwarming to get an inside glimpse at an intellectual hobby that crosses (pun intended) all groups regardless of age, economic status, etc. Not only did I walk away inspired to become an avid New York Times Crossword Puzzler, but uplifted by the positive comradery of the puzzling community. In a world where it seems so easy to find things that divide us, it was wonderfully surprising and satisfying to see this warm film about something uniquely universal. The creators non-judgemental treatment of the pastime and those devoted to it is worth at least 4 stars whether or not you like to engage in wordplay.",1154995200,10,944,4.692771084337349
1606282,4,B00005JP6U,"Wordplay (Patrick Creadon, 2006)

Are there people living in America today who have never done a crossword puzzle? I've never met one, that I know of. Crosswords are one of those pastimes that many, many people use to fill in time now and again, when waiting at the doctor's office or over their Sunday morning coffee. But there are others, as there are with every hobby, for whom the crossword is an all-consuming passion. It is those people who are the subject of Patrick Creadon's delightful documentary Wordplay.

The usual suspects-- Times crossword editor Will Shortz, famous crossword creator Merl Reagle, a number of contestants at the 2005 crossword championship-- are profiled here, and it is in fact their story that provides the narrative thrust and the drama (the climax of the film is coverage of the 2005 crossword championship). Creadon detours every once in a while to shine the light on more famous crossword aficionados-- Bill Clinton, the Indigo Girls, and the (unfunny, as usual) Jon Stewart, for example-- but the majority of this footage is devoted to people whom most of the viewers of this film will have never heard of. And, also as with any hobby, you find some wonderfully engaging personalities, ranging from the personable to the flat-out weird.

The obvious comparison here is to Spellbound, the wonderful documentary about spelling bees. Most of the folks you find here are more, for lack of a better term, normal; Creadon lets you see inside other portions of their lives, and this makes for more rounded characters, rather than the simple distractions from the main thrust of the film one might expect.

Both are wonderful movies, and both are highly recommended. Wordplay is an engaging, often funny, look at the world of crossword-solving, and crossword puzzle fans will love it. If that person who's never done a crossword puzzle does exist, maybe this will get him sufficiently enough interested to give them a shot. ****",1153267200,6,1959,4.981651376146789
1606283,5,B00005JP6U,"Are you an aficionado of the New York Times Crossword Puzzle?  Do you fill in the blanks with pen?  Do you keep a record of how long it takes to finish each puzzle?  If you answer yes to all of the above, then ""Wordplay"" is the film for you.  This light-hearted documentary stars Will Shortz, the editor of the New York Times Crossword puzzle, puzzle master for NPR's Weekend Edition, and the founder and director of the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. He is the only person in the world to hold a college degree in Enigmatology, the study of puzzles, which he earned from Indiana University in 1974.

Directed with a sense of fun by Patrick Creadon, and featuring a lively musical soundtrack, ""Wordplay"" has an eclectic cast, including former President Bill Clinton, who uses a blue felt tip pen to fill in his puzzle, as well as comedian Jon Stewart and Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina.  Stewart and Mussina approach their puzzles differently.  Stewart yells maniacally as he dares Shortz to defeat him.  Jon dryly admits, ""I am a Times puzzle fan.  I will solve the USA Today [puzzle], but I don't feel good about myself.""  Mike Mussina, who is shown in his Yankee uniform working on his puzzle in the dugout, admits that he finds solving the Times crossword very relaxing.  The famous documentary filmmaker, Ken Burns, is another junkie who eagerly looks forward to his fix.  He asserts that the New York Times Crossword is a celebration of language, which is the common denominator that unites us all.

However, it is not the well-known faces who make this film sing, but the ordinary Janes and Joes.  There is an entertaining segment with Merl Reagle, a Crossword Constructor, who allows the viewer to look over his shoulder while he creates a new puzzle.  Even more involving are the scenes featuring the top participants in the Annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament in Stamford, Connecticut, which will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary next year.

Tyler Hinman, Al Sanders, Ellen Ripstein, and Trip Payne are everyday people whom we might run into on the subway or in a supermarket.  For them, the Annual Crossword Puzzle Tournament is serious business, and it is fun to watch them practice and sweat bullets as they compete against their fellow experts.  Each viewer will cheer for his or her particular favorite as the competitors strive to achieve perfection.  It is also heartwarming to observe the camaraderie that exists among the tournament participants of all ages and from all walks of life.  This is a select fraternity of unique individuals who enjoy one another's company, and for whom solving puzzles is a lifelong and consuming passion.",1151798400,10,2669,4.915178571428571
1606284,4,B00005JP6U,"""Wordplay"", a new documentary about people who play crossword puzzles... If you have read this far, you will probably enjoy this film... is a lighthearted look at the people who solve puzzles, their lives and the annual tournament they compete in.

If you listen to NPR or look at the Arts section of the New York Times, you are probably familiar with Will Shortz. Shortz, the editor of the NY Times Crossword Puzzle, considered by many to be the best in the country, is a revered man in his community and he is at the center of ""Wordplay"". But the film isn't only about him, telling vignettes of other people as well. In a lively manner, it depicts how the puzzles are created, shows people solving puzzles, depicts some of the participants in the annual Crossword Tournament, organized and hosted by Shortz, and attempts to provide a sketch of the people who are so interested in crossword puzzles.

A brief look at the evolution of the NY Times Puzzle leads into a short bio of Shortz himself. He attended a very liberal college in Illinois and was able to write his own curriculum leading to a degree in Enigmatology; basically, he was able to study the art of puzzles and to create puzzles. This eventually led to a job as the editor of the New York Times Crossword Puzzle, considered by many to be the best in the country, if not the world. He explains what his job entails; he receives puzzles, decides which day of the week it will run and rewrites some of the clues. Did you know certain days are easier than others? Monday and Tuesday are supposed to be easier. I didn't. In an amusing scene, Shortz reads some of the letters he receives, complaining about the puzzles. People apparently take these things very seriously.

As the film progresses, we meet some other people. One of whom is Will Reagle, a frequent contributor to the NY Times Crossword. He explains a little about the history of the puzzle's development, some of the rules established by the puzzle's former editor, and shows us how he creates a new puzzle. As he works, the film cuts to various celebrities solving the same puzzle; we see brief shots of Jon Stewart, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, the Indigo Girls, Ken Burns and others as they work through the various clues. As we watch Will come up with the various ideas for the puzzle, the theme, and more, it is fun to watch the various celebrities working out the same clues, figuring out the theme. Shifting back and forth between the two sequences adds a lot of filmic quality to the project and makes it infinitely more interesting than watching some guy sit at a table filling in a grid.

Throughout the film, director Patrick Creadon uses other similar techniques to make the project move in a much more fast paced manner and also seem more accessible to people who aren't devoted to puzzles on a daily basis.

Soon, the action shifts to the annual Crossword Tournament, at the Stamford, Connecticut Radisson. Hosted by Shortz, the Tournament provides an opportunity for many returning players to catch up, socialize and meet new people also devoted to crossword puzzles. We meet many of the returning players, getting a little snapshot of their lives but the story concentrates on a handful of regulars; Tyler Hinman, a 20 year old wiz kid ready to take first place, Trip Payne, a former champion, receiving moral support from his boyfriend, Ellen Ripstein, another former champion, ready to take the trophy again, Patrick Jordan, the venerable also ran, having placed third repeatedly without ever winning, returns as well, ready for victory.

As the Tournament begins, brief explanation and easy to understand graphics explain the rules and help us understand how everything works. As the puzzles are introduced, we see the clues for various entries and have a few moments to figure them out as the contestants work through them. This is a great idea, because it makes the viewer feel as though they are part of the action, giving us a stake in the outcome.

The most enjoyable scenes are of the contests, which  begin with close-ups of participants - their backgrounds, tricks they use, etc. and then the suspense of the contests.  You find yourself rooting for a particular person and share the agony/ecstacy of each round in the contest.  Some players have won 1st, 2nd, 3rd places consistently.

Did you know that there are contests for solving crossword puzzles?

Perhaps you recognize the name Will Shortz, or maybe like me, from time to time you attempted a New York Times crossword puzzle without noticing his name as the editor.

This video takes us behind the scenes of crosswords in the United States. I was extremely surprised to find that I enjoyed watching it, and can still remember much of the video. I have a son-in-law who has been an editor for most of his life, and he loved it. I predict that anyone who cares about words, their usage, definitions, misuses - most writers - players of Words with Friends and certainly those obsessed with crossword puzzles will love this movie.

For instance, did you know that the Monday puzzles are easiest and progress in complexity to the Sunday puzzle? And did you know that crossword puzzles are symmetrical, such that the black squares viewed the right-side up look the same as they do upside-down?!

However, what was most inspiring to me was the tenacity of Will Shortz in pursuing his passion. It really reminded me of the George Bernard Shaw quote: ""The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself."" Shortz had discovered at an early age that he loved puzzles and proceeded to construct a major for himself in college dedicated to the study of them. I was just awestruck that someone at that young of an age would understand that he didn't need to abide by the confined choices in society. I think most people never arrive at that for their whole lives. It really made me think about the number of times in my life when I force-fit myself into a predetermined set of choices or in accordance with society's expectations of me.

Only drawback to this movie is its length. I think the point comes across in the first 60 minutes, and then it kind of plods along for the final 30 minutes. I do applaud the director for making the finale - a crossword puzzle championship that takes place on stage - highly suspenseful.

1606835,5,B00005JP6U,"""Word Play"" is a terrific documentary that interviews the folks who live for crosswords (Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, Ken Burns and Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina), the folks who create the puzzles, the folks who organize puzzle play (Will Shortz) and the many folks who compete in Shortz's annual crossword puzzle championship. The first half of the film focuses on celebrities and their love of the puzzles. Stewart, predictably, hams and blusters his way through his puzzle. Clinton tells of the day before the 1996 election when both ""Bob Dole Elected and ""Clinton Elected"" were the answers to the same puzzle clue in that day's New York Times.

The second half of the film focuses on the geeky competitors in the championship. While there is true competition between the players, there is also great fellow feeling. It was wonderful to see several competitors fight for another's right to points that were denied him in error. It was heartbreaking to watch a perennial 3rd-place finisher blow his shot at the title. Crossworders are the kind of unabashed nerds who love words, horrible puns and keep several dictionaries in the house. They work their puzzles in pen, and in a handful of minutes, unlike the rest of us who struggle and erase and try again. A wonderful film that captures the dedication and raw talent, pathos and grit of those who take words seriously and can perform like champs under pressure.

The extras were nothing special -- mostly scenes that were rightfully cut from the film. The film used some neat animation to keep the audience abreast of the puzzles being worked simultaneously in the finals.

If the puzzles aren't fun to you, I don't think this movie would be entertaining to you, although it's certainly not boring. For those (like me) who enjoy doing them, this documentary is a lot of fun to watch.

The film is in two parts: a look at ""celebrities"" who do crosswords, and a detailed look the USA Crossword Championships held in each in Stamford, Conn. We see the top players profiled and then are witness to the 200- tournament with it's dramatic 3-person playoff finals.

The first part is simply an unabashed Liberal love-fest with big plugs for the New York Times and NPR, and the celebs are all big Liberals, from Bill Clinton to Jon Stewart to Ken Burns, the Indigo Girls, etc.

Then, we get profiles of the top players, many of them fun to watch, from extreme introverts and extroverts. They are amazing crossword talents who can zip off thee answers to a fairly tough puzzle in just a few minutes.

1606904,4,B00005JP6U,"This is probably a film for crossword fans, though anyone who has ever wondered about people who seem hooked on crosswords will find this documentary a bit of a revelation, too. There are surprising moments in the film - first about things you take for granted. Where did crosswords come from and what are the underlying ""rules"" of creating crosswords? How does someone create a crossword? Who is responsible for the daily NY Times crosswords, and how did that get to be a real job? Then there are curious discoveries, like the obsession with time, and detours into subjects like whether a computer could ever be taught to do crosswords.

Structurally, the film is a lot like a crossword in the way its various story lines intersect. To show, I guess, that crosswords are not just for nerds, there are celebrity appearances from the Indigo Girls to Ken Burns to Bill Clinton. And finally there's coverage of the annual national crossword tournament in Stamford, CT, where you marvel at the hyped up drama and the complexities of the competition and the scoring itself - the playoff between the 3 highest scorers, wearing noise-producing headphones, is performed on stage before an audience. How did that evolve? Anyway, for novelty it's hard to beat this entertaining documentary about a basically unfilmable subject, and it may even get you trying the next crossword you see, just to see what all the excitement is about.",1212278400,,1422,4.9004149377593365

Everyone involved -- including President Bill Clinton, his erstwhile opponent Bob Dole, and Jon Stewart -- fits nicely into the mosaic of the story.  (The puzzle on the day of the Clinton-Dole election is, in its own small-corner-of-the-universe way, a masterpiece of the art form.)  Sure, the players have this little obsession about racing the clock to solve really hard crosswords, but they are also genuinely likeable people and this viewer, at least, came away impressed with their abilities, their sense of humor about their off-beat passion, and, not least, their articulate intelligence.  As one who whips through the early week puzzles and then struggles starting with Friday,I salute them.  Wordplay honors them too and does so very, very well.

1606974,5,B00005JP6U,"Since I was very young, I have had a love affair with language.  Words are such a powerful form of expression [in writing and verbal communication].  Words are a reflection of our times, as well as our culture.  Few people know this as well as puzzlemaster for the New York Times, Will Shortz.  He is the man behind the weekly crossword puzzle that appears in the publication and also is heard nationally on NPR, every weekend, with his puzzle quiz.  Not only are crossword puzzles great for the mind, but they have a huge following that transcends generations and socio/economic backgrounds.  For the first time, we see a more intimate side of Mr. Shortz, his formative years, as well as an annual puzzle competition that I would best describe as the Crossword Olympics.  It truly is a competitive sport.  There are also great, humorous moments in this film with banter from comedian Jon Stewart, former United States President Bill Clinton, the Indigo Girls and a slew of other fans of Will Shortz and his puzzle.

This film was so well done, and, it will [no doubt] draw comparisons to SPELLBOUND, which follows the National Spelling Bee and the young contestants who intensively study the English language by reading the dictionary, practicing with flash cards and devoting their lives to mastering spelling.  WORDPLAY is different in that the first half of the film, I would say, is more focused on Will Shortz, his following of crossword puzzle fans and how the puzzles are created.  We even learn about the formula that they must use, as a template to derive the correct number of letters across, as well as down.  The puzzles are also reflective of current events, developments in pop culture, policy and politics.  They really are a sign of the times.  The second half of the film shifts its focus to the contestants pursuing the Crossword Puzzle Championship.  It'll have you biting your nails, too.  The director really captured the tension and suspense that intensifies as each contestant aspires to be the champion.  This is definitely a great film worth watching.  You'll walk away feeling that you learned something and also had a good time in the process!",1183593600,3,2171,4.853260869565218
1606975,4,B00005JP6U,"First we had a movie about Scrabble competitions, now here comes a movie about the ultimate crossword competition - organized by Will Short, master crossword puzzle creator.

This film doesn't quite let us get to know its competitors in the same way the Scrabble documentary let us get to know its enthusiasts. But this film shows a lot more besides the mere competition. It shows who designs many of ""The New York Times"" crossword puzzles and how the designers attack the problem. You'll learn a lot about crossword puzzle-design you probably didn't know. For example - computer programs generally aren't used. Short and others still do all the work out of their own brains. And did you know every puzzle must be symmetrical?

Then we see several celebrities at work solving a daily puzzle. Bill Clinton might have been more popular as President if he had run the Country as judiciously as he solves a crossword puzzle. He philosophizes as he goes along, saying that a puzzle should be approached in the same way you approach a problem of State - you scan for what you know first - then you slowly work your way out from there.

Jon Stewart attacks a problem as if he were in a hockey game - slapping, cursing, jabbing at the page. At first I thought he was putting on a show of aggression for the camera - but no, that's really his all-out way of doing the daily crossword.

The documentary briefly discusses the origins of the crossword puzzle in the U.S. I would have liked to hear a lot more about the history of the puzzle and how the character of clues might have changed over the decades. And I was disappointed to find no discussion at all of the British tradition of crossword puzzles. How and why did the Brits develop their puzzles along such a different path? In the U.S., despite some punning around the theme of each puzzle, most of the clues call for straightforward synonyms. But in England, almost all the clues involve elaborate combinations of anagrams, puns, rebuses, homonyms, the works. What does this say, if anything, about the difference between British and American culture? And what about crosswords in other cultures, other languages? I wanted more! Maybe as DVD bonus material!

Still, this film provides an interesting look into crosswording a la ""The New York Times."" You can't be down or cross when you have a fresh puzzle facing you in the morning - or after you've finished watching this film.",1181606400,2,2428,4.7035294117647055

This whimsical documentary introduces you to the world of word nerds who are addicted to the NY Times crossword puzzle, people like Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, the Indigo Girls and pitcher Mike Mussina of the New York Yankees. But the best takes are those about ordinary people-- there are 50 million puzzleheads out there-- who compete every year in Stamford, and also the ""crossword constructors"" who create the puzzles with their dastardly clues (the Times uses about 110 puzzle constructors in a year). Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for the NYT, looms large throughout the film; thirty years ago at Indiana University where you could create your own major he specialized in ""enigmatology."" If you want to compete at Stamford, sharpen your pencil; it takes only 3-4 minutes for the champion puzzlers to solve that bugger in your morning paper.",1181260800,,1093,5.044198895027624

New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz is the film's tour guide into  this quirky community.  Shortz is just plain likable.  You feel his love of the puzzles and their creators, and the many friends he's made in the puzzling community.

This is a great, true independent film, successfully using an offbeat topic to make a joyous universal statement about creativity, humor and friendship.

1606979,5,B00005JP6U,"So, I do a bit of crossword now and then, though, sad to say, the T.V. Guide crossword is more up my alley (I've yet to finish a Sunday New York Times puzzle). There's something quite agreeable, though, about sitting down somewhere and filling in blanks with the proper words. It relaxes me even as the mind flexes its muscles. WORDPLAY is a fascinating look into the world of crossword puzzle solvers. Me, I'm an on again, off again puzzle hobbyist and I enjoyed this film tremendously, so I figure people who really obsess on crosswords will rally fervently around this documentary.

WORDPLAY initially concentrates on Will Shortz, who holds a degree in enigmatology and is the current editor of the New York Times Crossword. The New York Times crossword, by the way, is celebrated here as the crossword of choice for the puzzle connoisseur (or to quote Jon Stewart: ""I will solve, in a hotel, a USA Today, but I don't feel good about myself when I do it."") The film branches out to cover several famous folks who are big, big fans of the crossword, amongst whom the most interesting are Bill Clinton and Jon Stewart (who, by the way, assaults a crossword puzzle like a pitbull terrier). The viewer also meets a handful of regular people who just happen to be competitors of the annually held American Crossword Puzzle Tournament. There's also an eye-opening segment on how a puzzle is constructed. The last half of WORDPLAY focuses on the crossword tournament itself (this one held in 2005) and what would turn out to be its lip biting finish.

The film does a very good job of showcasing these smart-as-a-whip, pocket-protector-wearing crossword whizzes in an enlightening and sympathetic manner, making it fairly hard for the common viewer to summarily dismiss them. They're all very engaging as they speak of and go about their main passion. As someone mentioned in the audio commentary, you'll remember these folks' names even after the movie's over.

Surprisingly, there's real, palpable tension during the competition. In its execution of editing, its perfectly captured camera shots of the ""big"" moments (only 3 cameras were used), and its use of musical score and song selection, WORDPLAY surprises the viewer into becoming engrossed in the proceedings as the tournament wends its way to the final stage, wherein the three finalists would have to wage their competition on giant crosswords in front of the entire audience. What happens then exceeds the filmmakers' expectations.

The bonus features are hefty. For me, the highlights are: the relaxed audio commentary by Director Patrick Creadon, Will Shortz, and puzzle constructor Merl Reagle; a ""WORDPLAY Goes to Sundance"" segment; a short film ""Waiting for the New York Times"" by Patricia Erens, which centers on the difficulty of landing a Sunday New York Times on Sunday morning in the tiny town of Three Oaks, Michigan; ""And the Winner Is"" - a quick segment about the 2006 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament; and the 5 puzzles accessible thru DVD-Rom.

Let's face it, there's just something in our makeup which makes us push and prod and question things. Crossword puzzles are just one more way for us to answer that need. In so doing, we celebrate in a small way our mastery of communication, our power over words. As spoken, sung, or written, words can destroy or uplift or illuminate. And they also do one more thing. To quote the Indigo Girls and to sum up the underlying message of this documentary: ""Words connect us.""",1175644800,,3493,4.923599320882852

It's amazing to see how pouplar Mr. Shortz is in the NYC area, not only be the average puzzle solver, but the celebrities as well! I also got to see that crossword lovers are much more than the aging boomer, as young people are also passionate about crosswords. Another interesting element of the film is the tournament, which appears to be more of a ""circle of friends"" among the top players.

I also watched the extra short about the small town people who feel it is worth it to get up early on Sunday morning just to mosey on down to their mini-mart to get the Sunday Times. And you thought life was so hectic these days!

All in all, a nice film for crossword lovers as well as those who just want to see the biggest name in one of America's pasttimes!",1172275200,,853,4.291925465838509
1607064,5,B00005JP6U,"The movie is a documentary about crossword puzzles, crossword puzzle makers and crossword puzzle solvers.  It focuses on Will Shortz, the puzzle editor for The New York Times and the annual competition he started back in the 1970s.  On the way to the competition you meet the folks who construct the puzzles and those who take great joy in solving them.  And the solvers range from former US Presidents to major league baseball players to pop music stars to Jon Stewart.  Believe me, watching Stewart plowing into a puzzle is worth the price of admission in itself.

The less famous players are folks who can do annagrams on the fly, have sets of unabridged dictionaries, and can do the Times Sunday puzzle in four minutes or so.  These are folks who have marvelous talents but are short of people skills.  They're the ones who were bullied in the playground, but they have found something they can take pride in.  And the film's makers treat them with respect and kindness.

There is bonus material in which some famous puzzle makers show how they go about constructing these challenges.

The film has much wit and real respect for the talents of its subjects.",1171238400,2,1161,4.731343283582089
1607065,4,B00005JP6U,"`Wordplay' is a novel idea for a documentary.  Gather all the key prodigy contestants in a crossword puzzle contest and interview celebrity crossword aficionados, and you've got yourself a focused and engaging presentation.  Will Shortz, editor of the `New York Times' crossword puzzles, does most of the narrative, including insights into the ways and means of crossword creation.  One scene has Shortz appearing on NPR, and the hate mail he gets is interesting.  At first seeming like a trivial affair, the film becomes great fun.  Who else should give heartfelt, informal testimonial of the joys of using and aligning words than politicians, songwriters, and comedians?  Comedian, Jon Stewart; Former President, Bill Clinton; New York Yankees pitcher, Mike Mussina; and Indigo Girls, Amy Ray and Emily Saliers describe their passion.  Never taking themselves too seriously, they describe the fun and fringe benefits of aligning words.  Former President Clinton is both low-key and appealing.  He cites ""the ability to communicate,..."" and ""they're fun,"" as the puzzles' best assets.  He should know.  Besides testimonials, we get key participants of the annual crossword contest.  Taking place at a hotel convention room, we have all the excitement you expect from reality TV, considering we get concise backgrounds of some champs in their own homes.  When we see the contest, we get an effective split screen showing the puzzle and the clues matched with a player`s performance.  We can read the puzzle while the computerized answers slowly unfold.  The whole process sheds light not only on the passion, but the steps of brilliance that lead to the answers.  Shortz leaves the affair with words to live by, ""Crossword puzzles are something that fit into a basic human need to figure things out.""  Wisely, 'Wordplay' does all the work for us.",1170806400,,1846,5.224489795918367

1607069,4,B00005JP6U,"I have half-heartedly tried the New York crossword puzzles on occasion but had no idea what a devout following they had until I watched this refreshing 2006 documentary. Structured a bit like 2002's ""Spellbound"", the entertaining film that builds toward the 1999 Scripps National Spelling Bee, first-time director Patrick Creadon uses the 2005 American Crossword Puzzle Tournament as his climactic event where a group of nimble-minded crossword solvers vie for the championship. However, Creadon wisely focuses much of the film's initial attention on Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times who has gained renown as NPR's Puzzle Master. At his post since 1993, he has dramatically transformed the puzzle from an often frustrating, intellectualized exercise full of obscure clues to a more broad-based challenge that embraced popular culture and word games.

The change has engendered a diverse number of celebrity fans, several interviewed here in entertaining snippets - a particularly caustic Jon Stewart, Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina, the Indigo Girls, filmmaker Ken Burns in a somewhat zen-like state, a wry Bob Dole, and Creadon's biggest get, an ingratiating Bill Clinton who conquers his puzzle with surprising zeal. Once the film turns its attention toward the tournament, the personalities of the top contenders are highlighted with the makings of a classic showdown among three-time champion and professional puzzle-maker Trip Payne; Al Sanders, the middle-aged perennial also-ran who can never seem to rank above third; and prodigious twenty-year old Tyler Hinman, the potential usurper who could become the youngest champion ever. One of my favorites is Ellen Ripstein, an unassuming statistician who twirls a baton, but the true unsung hero of the piece has to be frequent Times puzzle creator Merl Reagle.

Delving into the crossword puzzles themselves, the most interesting extra with the 2006 DVD is a featurette called ""Five Unforgettable Puzzles"" about how the five of the most challenging Times puzzles were constructed as recounted by the creators themselves. Naturally, the puzzles are included in the accompanying booklet as well as the DVD-ROM for printing. The DVD also includes an amiable and insightful commentary track by Creadon, Shortz and Reagle, as well as a bevy of deleted scenes, including extended versions of the celebrity interviews. There is a twenty-minute short about the film's reception at the 2006 Sundance Festival, including a Q&A with the top contenders, as well as a music video. It's a robust package for a niche-oriented film but one that is more entertaining than it has any right to be.",1169596800,3,2661,5.378896882494005

The subjects in Wordplay are interesting, but don't seem to be as far out there as those in 'Word Wars'.  From all three of these films, it's clear that there's a niche for everyone...and in each niche there are some real fanatics.

1607137,4,B00005JP6U,"Maybe they should make a documentary about people that enjoy documentaries.  If that ever happens, Wordplay will be one of the films that documentary-heads will obsess over.  It entertains, educates and gives you true insight into a fascinating subculture.  No, I'm not a serious puzzlehead but I do enjoy the crosswords; and after seeing the abilities of the participants in the annual American Crossword Puzzle Tournament it's going to be a long, long time before I might work up the nerve to test my mettle in that competitive endeavor.  But in a society where we crown national champions for children's athletic teams, what's wrong with a national crossword championship?  The answer is a seven letter word beginning with N.  Nothing!

The filmmakers suck you in by exposing you to a few well known people (Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart, the Indigo Girls, Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina and others) who explain their fascination with puzzles, as well as introducing you to Will Shortz the editor of the New York Times Crossword Puzzle (the pinnacle of puzzleship).  We also get to meet Merl Reagle, a puzzle constructor, who explains how he builds a puzzle with just the smallest grain of a theme idea.  Later on the camera watches as each of the personalities works the puzzle we watched Reagle build, listening as they explain their particular way of attacking the answers.  Stewart is particularly funny with his reactions (duh!).

Shortz comes across as a surprisingly appealing personality.  I was expecting some kind of sadistic intellectual prig in a white shirt and bow tie, but Will is a decidedly normal human being with interests beyond puzzles and an almost complete lack of pretension.  That last observation is underscored by several images of him sitting cross-legged on the floor watching the final three contestants labor over the last puzzle of the tournament.

The last 30 minutes or so deals with the 2005 Tournament, as we watch various competitors that we've met earlier in the film compete with and encourage each other.  It's a joy to see that a contest can be so civil without sacrificing any of the competitiveness.

It's difficult not to like this, whether you've never done a puzzle in your life, use pencil or ink, or even take a week and a half to get through one.",1166659200,4,2292,4.914285714285715

The celebrities interviewed by the director were interesting and entertaining: Will Shortz, Jon Stewart, Bill Clinton, Mike Mussina, the Indigo Girls, and Ken Burns. Shortz is always interesting. His enthusiasm for puzzles is contagious. Jon Stewart was very funny for the short time he was on. The film centered on the annual competition in New York, but also showed how a New York times crossword is developed, editted, published and then solved by the celebs. It was a very interesting process.

I took off a star because the competition was intense, but other films in this genre were far more interesting. All the competitors were fairly normal people. In ""Word Wars"", it was a true subculture of people who played scrabble almost professionally. These people were on the margins of society. ""Spellbound"" was a look at the competitors and the families that compete. The movie was about the stress the kids put on themselves and how the parents handled the competition. The other movies were just more compelling. However,if you like Spellbound and Word Wars you will like this movie as well.",1166054400,,1201,5.127551020408164

This episode perfectly sums up the kind of dedication these puzzles inspire and require. Wordplay profiles Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The New York Times and explores a hobby that millions of people practice on buses and subways to and from work every day. What is the appeal of crossword puzzles? This entertaining and informative documentary answers this question.

This is a fun, engaging documentary that successfully conveys the passion people have for crosswords. All one needs is a puzzle and something to write with and there is something comforting about that kind of simplicity in this day and age where everyone seems to be plugged into an iPod or a Playstation.

There is an audio commentary by director Patrick Creadon, New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz and crossword constructor Merl Reagle. Shortz comes across as a naturally funny guy who tells some amusing anecdotes. This is a very genial, engaging track that compliments the documentary quite well.

Also included are seven deleted scenes pertaining to Shortz. We see footage of him reading another fan letter, footage of him talking about the difficulty he had taking over at the New York Times and the negative mail he received about how much tougher the puzzles were when he took over.

There are six additional deleted scenes with the other puzzle solvers in the doc. Ellen Ripstein talks about the allure of puzzles for her while Al Sanders speaks about how he is at the perfect age for solving puzzles.

There are three deleted scenes from the Stamford Crossword Tournament including more interviews with other attendees.

The ""Interview Gallery"" features more footage of the celebrity puzzle solvers. Ken Burns talks about his love for crosswords while Jon Stewart talks about meeting Shortz in person for the first time.

""5 Unforgettable Puzzles from the Pages of the New York Times"" features footage of five people who created some of the most memorable crosswords in the newspaper's history. One lady designed a pictorial puzzle and another designs humourous puzzles with puns.

1607141,4,B00005JP6U,"""Wordplay"" is director Patrick Creadon's homage to crossword puzzles, their creators, and their most avid solvers. The elite of crossword culture share their insights and expertise: New York Times crossword editor Will Shortz, who founded the Annual Crossword Puzzle Tournament held in Stamford, Connecticut since 1978. Puzzle constructor Merl Reagle. And a diverse assortment of five expert puzzle solvers who were among those competing at the 28th Annual Tournament in 2005. The ubiquity of crossword puzzles in American culture is represented by interviews with celebrity enthusiasts Jon Stewart, documentarian Ken Burns, The Indigo Girls (Amy Ray & Emily Saliers), former President Bill Clinton, and Yankee pitcher Mike Mussina.

""Wordplay"" takes the audience on two journeys: Our five competitive crossword solvers anticipate the national Tournament and tell us a little about their hobby. And we watch Merl Reagle create a puzzle on the ""word play"" theme that will appear in the New York Times. To tie the two threads up nicely, the celebrity solvers all work Reagle's crossword, and, of course, we watch our five crossword whizes compete in the 3-day 2005 Tournament, right through to the nerve-racking championship round. Although the highly ranked contestants are very competitive, the Annual Crossword Puzzle Tournament is strikingly low-key and friendly. Perhaps that is because crossword-solving is a solitary pursuit. Competitors never confront one another.

""Wordplay"" is a low-key documentary to match its subject. But crossword fans will be amazed by the skill of the competitors, intrigued by the creation and editing of puzzles, and in accord with the celebrity solvers as they express the charm of crosswords. ""Wordplay"" is an engaging tour of crossword culture that hits all of the most compelling facets of these wonderful word puzzles.

1607142,4,B00005JP6U,"The DVD of the documentary film ""Wordplay"" hit the stores this week. When the film originally played the Philadelphia Film Festival this past Spring it included a few scenes of a local Philadelphia attorney Susan Katz Hoffman, an avid crossword puzzle fan who also attends the annual national competition in Washington, DC. The Film Festival version ran nearly 2 hours and was edited down to 85 minutes for the theatrical release and most of Hoffman's scenes were cut. (She appears at two points but the only words we hear (when she meets friends from prior tournaments) are ""Hi, how are you?"".

I was anxious to see if there would be more of Hoffman on the DVD version, especially since it has quite a few ""deleted scenes"" as a bonus. Sadly, there is no more Hoffman since all the included ""deleted scenes"" are of the ""stars"" of the film - those who made it to the finals. But the bonus features are still entertaining, as is the whole film, if you haven't seen it in the theaters.

There are enough readers of the daily New York Times crossword puzzle that it's said that, if the puzzle was no longer published, readership would drop substantially. The Editor of the Times crossword, Will Shortz, is the founder of the national competition and the center focus of the film. To give it more ""star"" power, Director Patrick Creadon, interviewed celebrity crossword puzzle addicts such as former President Bill Clinton, Jon Stewart and even the musical duo the Indigo Girls. I'm not a crossword fan but - like Spellbound (about the National Spelling Bee), which played the Film Festival two years ago - I became fascinated with the personalities of the finalists and picked the one I wanted to win.

The DVD also contains some featurettes, and a record of the first showing at the Sundance Film Festival. There's a full-length commentary but I haven't gotten to that yet. (Maybe Hoffman is mentioned there.) . It's certainly worth watching for anyone and would make a great holiday gift for any family or friends who are crossword addicts.
