5277367,2,B009846274,"""Wu Dang""  takes place in 1920's China.  There is a rumor that secret treasure is hidden in Wu Dang Mountain.  An American man, greedy for gold and riches, brings his daughter, a prodigy in martial arts, to compete for a championship title in kung fu combat, while planning to find and steal the riches for himself.  It won't be easy.  Fierce competition, dedicated protectors, and unexpected romance block the path to the Wu Dang fortune.  The closer the treasure hunter gets to his prize, the more elusive it becomes.

This is strictly a movie for martial-arts fans.  There is plenty of well-staged action, a simple plot, and passable visual effects.  In Mandarin, with English subtitles, the movie begins promisingly enough, but soon sinks under the weight of a weak script.

There is a making-of featurette on the Blu-ray release.",1355270400,7,834,4.9352517985611515

5277371,3,B009846274,"With costumes by Oscar-winning designer Emi Wada, ""Wu Dang"" is a martial arts action movie that looks great, but lacks in most other ways.

Tang Yunlong (Vincent Zhao) is a treasure-hunting archaeology professor and martial arts fighter trying to locate seven artifacts and one holy sword. Tang Yulong and his daughter Tang Ning (Xu Jiao, who was Stephen Chow's young ""son"" in ""CJ7"") travel to a monastery in Wudang Mountains, where a martial arts tournament is about to be held. But there are other warriors looking for the same treasure, including a beautiful female fighter Tianxin (Yang Mi).

The story, which is set in a fictional China in the 1910s, looks like a cross between ""Indiana Jones"" and ""Dragon Ball."" Directed by Patrick Leung, the adventure film starts pretty well, but loses its momentum when the competition gets under way. With one dimensional personalities and non-existent back-story of characters, the film does not know what story it is trying to tell.

With actors like Dennis To as the tournament's organizer and Louis Fan as a young monk, as well as Hong Kong choreographer Corey Yuen, the film's old-style martial arts fight scenes (using wires and effects) are acceptable, but not very innovative. I like the film for its nice visuals but obviously ""Wu Dang"" needs a better story.",1372982400,2,1310,5.0
5277372,2,B009846274,"Ok, this is an old style kung fun type movie BUT....
Action is very poorly done, the fights seem week, no one seems to pack any power at all, everything is soft and gentel.

nothing memorable in any of the fights, the story is an OK story, but really for an action film it ranks very low.
the fights are slow, soft and boring, the plot does not make up for it, and if you wanna see a good martial arts film, don't waste your time on this movie.",1371254400,,444,3.9887640449438204
5277373,3,B009846274,"Amazon states that language is cantonese but it is actually mandarin, which I prefer.  I took a chance in buying it as I suspected that Amazon had incorrectly stated the language.  Netflix also makes this common error.  Since I am trying to learn some mandarin, accurate language information is important to me.",1370995200,2,311,4.9423076923076925
5277374,5,B009846274,WU Dang is a great action pack movie with a good storyline.  I highly recommend it to anyone who loves a good martial art movie.,1367798400,,128,4.12
5277375,5,B009846274,"Didn't know what to expect but to my surprise the movie gets a thumbs up from me! A great story about treasure hunting, kung fu fighting, love a flying, and special scenic views kind of movie. You'll like it too!",1363737600,,212,4.325
5277376,1,B009846274,"This film reminds me of the line from The Godfather: ""Don't insult my intelligence."" Michael Corleone would have definitely given this film the Don's kiss of disapproval. The storytelling is so bad it seems intentional. Painful to watch the plot crash around like it did.

For the most part, fight scenes are dynamic and enjoyable to watch. But no swordfighting for Vincent Zhao? He is unrivaled with the sword, yet the only times he picks one up in this flick is (1) to break into pieces and (2) scrub the rust off. For most of the rest of the movie he's running around playing Indiana Jones.",1363305600,,593,4.59433962264151
5277377,5,B009846274,"Very good DVD, and with a very good story line.  If you like just good martial arts movies this will do.  But if you want great this would not be the one for you.  This movie will kind of hold your interest , but not for long.",1362614400,,226,3.765957446808511

8537555,4,B009846274,"This is a well enough done movie - feels very much like the Asian National Treasure and Indiana Jones with wire martial arts and Yin Yang mysticism.

The action sequences are great, and the fight scene in the library was wonderfully choreographed, but there are a few weak spots.

The first is the tournament is not treated very tournament like - it is more of a side bar than the character it needs to be and could have been used more and in better ways.

The sleeping kung-fu was a bit lame, though it was humorous, but that could have been done better as well.

Over all, this was fun, and an enjoyable watch but the re-watch value is depleted once the case is solved.",1403481600,,671,4.344
