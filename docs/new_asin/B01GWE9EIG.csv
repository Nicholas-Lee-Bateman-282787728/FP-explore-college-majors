8764192,5,B01GWE9EIG,"What a great shame, that this truly classic example of good old British street and Pub humour, has been disgracefully ignored and neglected. Despite this BBC TV show having a large hardcore UK following, and high praise from the Press, they pulled the plug after only two series. The BBC failed to give it a reasonable time slot, and, to my knowledge, very little pre-promotion. In recent years, the BBC, has completely lost it's once sharp eye, for new and creative comedy. It seems as though it is far easier ( and cheaper no doubt) attempting to recreate comedy greats from their golden years---with very little success. When a comedy show is set in one place--it take's a lot of ingenuity and inventive observation, to provide an almost endless flow of good gags. Add to this, the fact that all the same character's arrive each episode. This is not a new idea--it was first seen (I think) in the US series ''Cheers'', which was of course a huge international hit. This series has a very familiar role-call of known actors, including,  Dave Cash, 'Royal Family', Maxine Peak 'the Village' and Silk'  John Henshaw, 'Life on Mars'--and a very young James McAvoy.-'Atonement'. etc. Highly recommended, especially for those who are attuned to British humour.

This is a great comedy, with typical Northern humour-the jokes and the pisstaking come thick and fast and I was laughing all over again at the antics of all in the Grapes. There is a heartwarming feel to this series, and anyone who drinks, or has drank, in a Northern English pub in a big city or town in the early evening will know the atmosphere well and will have met or known characters like these in any pub they have been in. There is, under the humour, a poignancy to the stories of these really ordinary people; most of us can identify with that, but the poignancy doesn't overshadow the laughs. Great show all in all. By the way, the outtakes are brilliant and will have you laughing a lot!",1365724800,5,764,4.275862068965517
