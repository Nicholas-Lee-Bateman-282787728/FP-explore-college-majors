8302898,1,B001FWY09Y,Disappoint with portrayal of the diagnosis of schizophrenia. The movie attempted to weave a love story which contradicts symptomotology and failed to include substance abuse.,1425686400,,174,6.0
8302899,3,B001FWY09Y,I too have Schizophrenia and the movie made some errors. Like when he escaped from the mental hospital. Mental hospitals are locked down(like jails are) and no one can just walk out and climb a  small fence.  When you see the movie you will see more errors in it.,1400371200,,263,4.346938775510204
8302900,4,B001FWY09Y,I watched this intensely as I find psychology fascinating. I thought that they did a great job displaying the confusion of schitzophrenia. It was interesting to see the family dynamics as well. The despiration of mom and dad trying to do right by their sick child. The feelings of everyone are expressed as they try to find a way to a quality of life that they can live with. I liked it.,1369440000,,387,4.388888888888889
8302901,5,B001FWY09Y,"Now I know what my granddaughter goes through when she hears voices.  No wonder she tries to get away from them, and why she wants to get rid of them or herself in order to stop the noises from interfering in her life!
  When I saw this, it was so real, I wanted to go down to her house (she's 14) and gather her in my arms and promise to protect her forever.
 I will read everything I can and I will be involved in finding relief for her, no matter who believes in her stories or who doesnt!
 I had something like this happen to myself when I was 14ish, and it scared me to death.  I remember telling my parents and my best friends, and even a teacher, and nobody believed me......they thought it was some kind of hormonal thing...which maybe it was, who knows but it was real to me!  I didn't know what to do to make the voices and visions stop......I thought I was probably going crazy or something...It lasted about two weeks and stopped as fast as it started......but my granddaughters didn't stop...as long as she takes her meds, the voices fade into the background, but if she stops because she's feeing okey, she has an ""incident"".
This is the best movie on this subject, and I thank the people involved for taking the time to show the voices and all the other symptoms so they can be understood by the rest of us.  It must be terrible to have to live with these things in your ears all the time, and the visions to disturb your every moment.  I'm having all the members of our family see this movie to better understand our loved one and I highly recommend it to other families as well.  God help us help those afflicted with Schizophrenia and God bless you for making this movie!!  Thank you from our family!",1348358400,,1718,4.287925696594427

Exciting, well acted thriller that also accurately shows someone developing schizophrenia,,  his experiences with the health system, how his friends react and how he and his family cope. A lot more realistic than A Beautiful Mind about John Nash. This film depicts an ordinary teen.
