7944208,3,B00005LP6F,"TEENAGE DOLL (1957) is one of the better films from a 50's cycle of 'bad girl' flicks mostly helmed by either Edward L. Cahn or Roger Corman, which also included ""Runaway Daughters"", ""Sorority Girl"", ""Dragstrip Girl"" and ""Reform School Girl"".

In TEENAGE DOLL, poor little rich girl Barbara (June Kenney) lands in a whole mess of trouble when she accidentally kills a Black Widow gang member, and later ignites a turf-war when her biker boyfriend Eddie (John Brinkley) gets involved!  Fay Spain, Ziva Rodann and Barboura Morris co-star.

June Kenney was always a welcome presence in these JD epics, and she's also well-remembered for her performances in ""Sorority Girl"" and ""Attack of the Puppet People"".  If Ms Kenney had one weakness, it was the fact that her blonde all-American beauty forever pegged her as the 'nice girl' even when her character dictated otherwise; as opposed to Fay Spain who could effortlessly shift from playing the 'good girl' in ""Dragstrip Girl"" to tough-as-nails gang leader Helen in TEENAGE DOLL.

Image Entertainment's DVD release has a solid, stable-looking print.  Bonuses are confined to the trailer.  Well worth a look for Fifties JD fans.",1249344000,2,1173,5.109947643979058
7944209,4,B00005LP6F,"The second and final co-production between Roger Corman and the Woolner Brothers (released by Allied Artists), Teenage Doll is easily on par or better than any of Cormans AIP juvenile delinquent epics. The relatively dark story of good-girl June Kenney running afoul of bad-girl gang (headed by Fay Spain) and winding up involved in a murder is played basically straight. More compelling than other contemporary JD dreck like, say Hot Rod Gang or High School Confidential (both of which I also like a lot for different reasons), Teenage Doll  contains a handful of those uniquely twisted Corman/Charles B. Griffith sick/icky/creepy moments (e.g., Fay Spain appears to be living in Walter Paisleys trash-strewn apartment with her malnourished baby sister), as well as lots of goofy hep-talk and an effective rumble scene set in an auto salvage yard. However, if you're expecting steamy sleaze, based on the films misleading advertising materials, you may be a bit disappointed. The cast includes a number of familiar Corman regulars including John Brinkley, Barboura Morris, Richard Devon, Dorothy Neumann, Ed Nelson, and Bruno VeSota, not to mention the sultry Ziva (Pharaohs Curse) Rodan. The stark B&W cinematography is by Floyd (Davids dad) Crosby.
The DVD presentation is minimal but very clean. An excellent-condition trailer with some light speckling/scratching, chapter stops, and four bonus trailers are the only extras, but the source print used for the feature is in terrific shape. The tonal values, brightness, contrast, sharpness, and detail are uniformly excellent and there is only some very light speckling evident. Considering how few decent DVDs are out there so far for the 50s JD aficionado (this is about the only one Im aware of), genre fans might as well snap this up.",1007596800,14,1791,5.2622377622377625
7944210,5,B00005LP6F,"One of Corman's best features, this film stars June Kenney in her first major, role and she does a great job playing a girl from the right side of the tracks who gets her lilly-white self into a lot of trouble when she  tangles with a tough all-girl gang lead by Fay Spain! John Brinkley  co-stars as a James Dean type hood who Kenney has the hots for! Lots of  action abound and fine performances by all involved! Also featuring  Barboura Morris, Dorothy Neumann, Ziva Rodann, Jay Sayer and many other  Corman regulars!",954374400,9,520,4.548387096774194
