8621793,5,B00GB0OWM0,"This series is very interesting, and my comments apply to each of the DVDs from this source
If these discs don't dispel the idea of ""the hard-bitten old pros in the symphony orchestra who turn up to play worn out pieces time after time"", then nothing will.  Each of the players in this ""scratch orchestra"" are at the top of the profession, and I have not seen anything other than genuine enthusiasm on the faces throughout these performances.  Perhaps it could be argued that (using a sporting analogy) that a ""team of champions"" may not always equate to ""a champion team"", but given that these superstars of the profession only meet over a weekend and rehearse and record, there are glimpses of what they COULD achieve if playing together full time.  I imagine that the players, each of whom play in outstanding groups on a daily basis, enjoy the subtle differences produced by the other players in this orchestra.  And it is these sounds and nuances which provide each player some novelty, where a range of ""long familiar sounds"" is played in a different manner than at their own group.
Each of these episodes features a ""warhorse"" and at least one piece of music that is more recently composed.  Whilst one could argue that there are better integrated performances (from full time groups), but these performances are interesting, polished and show some outstanding solo work from all sections of the orchestra.
There is clearly a good deal of respect all round for Gerard Schwarz, and he for them.  The interviews are all interesting in their own right, and most players express the feeling of honour at being part of the group.
These programmes are well worth the money, and I look forward to future editions from this orchestra and conductor.",1512864000,,1747,4.806666666666667
8621794,5,B00GB0OWM0,This whole series is really great.  If you're an orchestral or ensemble player or serious music lover...you MUST have each of these recordings.  And...they cost Sooo little.,1433376000,2,173,5.37037037037037
8621795,5,B00GB0OWM0,I think the audio on this dvd is superb. The orchestration and performance excellent. It helps to like this music. It's a newer version of the old Leonard Bernstein educational music performances from many years ago. I very much like what Schwarz has done assembling this orchestra. I especially pleased that the dvd contains more than one shown performance because it includes the Beethoven 5th and other pieces.,1410566400,3,413,5.088235294117647
8621796,1,B00GB0OWM0,"We are told that 19, or so, High Definition cameras captured the video for this recording.  Yet, it appears that no Blu-ray transfer was made, or is available.  How about the audio?  No mention is made if the audio playback is in 5.1 or 7.1 surround.  I see the word ""Dolby"" is shown, which means nothing.

When I think of all the great classical music now available on BLU-RAY with surround sound, I again ask:  Why Would I Buy This?",1392595200,,434,4.3625
8621797,5,B00GB0OWM0,"I would like to address first of all the technical limitations as I understand it of television.  First of all you have to watch these programs on a sonically deficient system and second you have to allocate time to make the recording or watch it as available.  I suggest that anyone considering this purchase should first review various online discussions of what is possible on the currently available recording systems.  These discs surpass everything else available.

When these discs arrived several weeks ago one of the first things we did was to call up a friend who has an amazingly good sound and video system.  We listened on our good equipment first and were blown away by the video and audio clarity.  We spent hours enchanted by most aspects of these discs.  We repeated this at our friends place but this time we got his view as a professional musician and he was similarly charmed.  In particular the three of us felt then and in later discussion that this is Gerard Schwarz at his best.  It is comparable to his last concert he performed in Seattle that I saw conducting the Seattle Symphony doing Bruckner's Symphony No. 4.  A review of that concert is available on the Seattle Times website.

A particular treat for the three of us was to see some of the excellent musicians from the Seattle Symphony up close and clearly articulated in their great skills.  It should be pointed out that the engineering was largely in the hands of some of the SSO's recording engineering staff.  The commentaries by Schwarz and the musicians could have been longer and less repetitive and that is a criticism that I hope will be corrected in following discs currently in preparation.  These discs are diminished by the repetitive ads on each of the discs.  More comments by more of these excellent musicians would have been a plus.

Whether one approves of the choices of pieces performed or not they are all excellently presented.",1388534400,6,1933,4.75975975975976
