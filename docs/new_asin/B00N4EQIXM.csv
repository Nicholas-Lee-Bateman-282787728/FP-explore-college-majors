8676224,5,B00N4EQIXM,Really good DVD for coaches just learning or currently running full court pressure defense. Coach Smart takes you through the building blocks of VCU's full court presses. You also get two separate Q & As and some of the VCU offensive stuff too. It's the hustle and intensity in all the drills that makes HAVOC what it is.,1413417600,,321,4.551724137931035
