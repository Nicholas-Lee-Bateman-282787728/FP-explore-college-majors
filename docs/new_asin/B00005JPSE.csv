7942484,1,B00005JPSE,"I really had high hopes for this movie, John Cusak, Samuel L. Jackson,
Tony Shalhoub...so much talent, this movie had to be great, right?
WRONG. Mr. Jackson and Mr. Shalhoub are in the movie a total of 20 mins
or so combined.

Most of the movie is just John Cusak, ranting in his room, ohmygod did
the manager dose the booze? I think so, but I'll just keep sucking it
down anyway, tho i'm having a very bad trip. I was reminded of the
movie Castaway with Tom Hanks, except the ever so charming Wilson, in
this case, is his trusty micro-recorder.

There were hints that the experience was manufactured by the manager,
such as the camera, the wires outside the window when he's hanging on
by his elbows, the ghosts that appear to be video images, the manager
with his ""well played mr. Enslin"" WTF?

This movie had no clear direction. Drugs? Ghosts? Electronic terror
tactics? Mental breakdown?

In taking us out of the room and into reality and then back to the room
and out into reality the movie really fails to answer any of these
questions. The characters are flat. The logic uneven and completely
illogical.

Though it was a painful and utterly frustrating experience I would love
to see the DVD and see if this was the director's vision or did this go
to the 6th level of hell in editing? Are there deleted or extended
scenes, director or actor commentary that could shed some light on how
a movie that seemed like it had so much potential could go so awry.

Honestly I'm scratching my head at all the positive comments I see
here, this movie to me was pure drivel, aimed at the lowest common
denominator.",1187308800,9,1609,4.493150684931507

In this thriller based on a Stephen King story, writer and paranormal debunker Mike Enslin (John Cusack) is determined to demystify the ghostly events, even though a hotel clerk (Samuel L. Jackson) begs him to rethink his plans. Mike needs to write another book soon, and room 1408 may be his ticket to the top of the best-seller list.

7942486,2,B00005JPSE,"Man, that's what they call room service!

OK, imagine this: you've flown in on the red-eye, LA to Boston, cramped flight, surly stewardesses---oh wait, they're flight attendants nowadays, or resume-challenged critters, whatever. They were surly. One spilled coffee on you, and that was the nice one: the other managed to ignore your call button all the way from the badlands over Nevada to Logan.

And anyway, nowadays flying business is like renting a timeshare in Dante's 8th circle of Hell: fat men on the left of you flu victim on the right of you, into the jaws of death sat the 500!

One rough cab ride through a tangle of dubious streets later, you're checked in to your sanctuary, your beachhead, your staging point & command center for the busy week ahead. You're wiped out. You want to get out of your oxfords, pad around in comfy clothes, pajamas maybe, fix yourself a little pot of that in-room coffee, brush your teeth, flop on the bed.

You fumble with the magnetic key, the door makes a little hiss and opens inward---GASP!---your mind reels in shock, horror, agony!

They said a double-king----this sad excuse for a bed looks like something out of summer camp!

The room is the size of a broom closet! There's no mini-bar! There is zero shower pressure! And worse---the whole place reeks of stale cigarette smoke! They promised you a NON-SMOKING room!

Man I'm telling you, when you're a business traveller, hotel rooms can really be a killer. But that's nothing compared to the Killer with wall-to-wall carpeting masquerading as an innocent little 40 x 40 square of Manhattan commercial real estate in the new Stevie King adaptation ""1408"".

It's a killer. A legendary killer, an oubliette of murder & madness relegated to the Bad Old History of the Dolphin Hotel, responsible for 56 deaths over its busy little lifespan: murders, suicides, hangings, stabbings, the works.

It is crouched, waiting in the stale, inky darkness, waiting for meat. It hasn't had a victim in years because the hotel keeps it locked up, recondite, no vacancy---ever. I imagine it's pretty hungry.

All it needs is an occupant, and a little room to work its magic. Let's start with the idea, which is King's in one sense (the viciously haunted hotel-room), but universal in another: hotel rooms, consummately transient places, are singularly creepy.

I remember many times sleepwalking among the blocky, startling objects standing their ground in unfamiliar quarters: muttering to myself, fumbling at my lock, bumping into strange arrangements of stale-smelling curtains and furniture. How many times do you think someone has gone a-roving in the deep nightland of dreams and snapped his neck because of the hotel room's unfamiliar topography?

Second is the setup and build, which is masterfully, deliciously done here: Samuel L. Jackson spins his gruesome little tale in grim counterpoint to Cusack's masterfully apathetic fencing, and this well-appointed little duel nicely sets the mood and pulled me in for a brutal little night of ghoulies and ghosties and long-legged beasties. It's a nice, classic, atmospheric build---but it did something else I hadn't expected.

It made me nervous.

So to begin with, I'm keyed up. I'm tense.

Director Mikael Hafstrom, working on first US film, gave me the crawls: the voices shrieking random nubmers and cryptic threats over the phone, that dull throb of despair, of nihilistic horror, the certainty that the universe is vast and endless and impersonal and cares not a whit about your fleeting, purposeless little life. That's evil.

And for about 45 minutes, I have to give 1408 credit for giving me a good case of the crawls. Hafstrom creates, remarkably, a very visual sense of disorientation that works its way to a kind of paranoid vertigo. His malign Room plays all sorts of diabolic little tricks on Cusack at first, creating the sneaking suspicious that someone's in the room, in the vent, leading to a nasty little game of hide-and-seek---in which you really don't want to find out what's doing the Hiding.

Even the nervous little battle of wills with a faulty A/C---when the repairman (champ vet actor Isiah Whitlock) refuses to cross the threshold and instead walks Cusack through the repair, I'm thinking ""smart man.""

But in the end, it's all for naught. Like any hotel room, much of the charm wears off about halfway through your stay. Watching the insidious, nihilistic, world-hating evil thing holed up in Room 1408 drive John Cusack mad: intriguing, only because you're not sure exactly what the room will cook up. Seeing big cracks ripple up through the wall and blood pour out, or the room explode, or a big vast icy tundra appear---I've seen that before. About the time you see the jumping ghost (man, talk about a depressing spirit), the movie is headed to Dullsville.

Take my advice: on this one, get an early wakeup call---and take plan on checking out early. Trust me: you'll thank me for it in the morning.

7942487,4,B00005JPSE,"Be prepared to be unnerved when Mike Enslin (John Cusack) undergoes the scariest hotel experience since Jack Torrance (aka Nicholson) checked his family into the Overlook and met the Shining.  Enslin is a cynical writer who pens books about haunted places although he doesn't actually believe they are haunted.  When an unsolicited postcard invites him to check into room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel, he decides to book a room.  Samuel L. Jackson, in an all-too-brief appearance as the hotel manager, tries every trick in the book to prevent Enslin from staying in the room, but nothing will deter the unbelieving writer from spending a night in 1408.  Things that go bump in the night will startle you and the heart-rending back-story on Enslin's life adds a compelling plot to the thrills, squeals, and chills awaiting Enslin and the viewer. John Cusack is amazing as always as he draws you into his private hell.  This is a movie that will get under your skin and chill your bones right up to the heart-stopping ending.",1184025600,8,1020,4.839080459770115
7942488,4,B00005JPSE,"Unlike myself, writer Mike Enslin (John Cusack) hates hotel rooms.

Enslin's distaste, however, is quite understandable.  The man makes his living travelling back-and-forth across America, dubunking hotels with reputations for being haunted.  So far, Enslin has never encountered anything more spooky in a room other than creaky floorboards or over-eager owners hoping to get a mention in one of his books. Thus it is only natural for him to be quite skeptical of the warnings from the Dolphin Hotel's manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) about Room 1408.  It seems that within the last hundred years over 50 people had died horrific deaths in that room.  And, ever since one of the housekeepers gouged out her own eyes while alone in that room , not even hotel staff will work in there unless it is in pairs, at 10 minute intervals, keeping the door open at all times.  As Olin puts it (delivered in classic Samuel L. Jackson style), ""Nobody has said anything about a ghost. I'm telling you it's just an evil motherf***ing room.""

Enslin is too cynical a man to take any of this seriously (and we do have a horror movie to watch).  But within minutes of entering 1408, when the bedside alarm clock begins playing the Carpenters' ""We've Only Just Begun,"" and then proceeds to set itself into countdown mode for one hour, Enslin is beginning to think he finally just might have stumbled onto the real thing.  Unfortunately and sadly for him.

1408 is a horror film in the classic genre.  A supernatural force of pure Evil undeniably possesses this room.  Whatever -literally- is at play here, tears into Enslin's mind, finding his losses and regrets, and his own self-loathing to relentlessly attack him both physically and psychologically.  Like Orwell's dreaded Room 101 with a supernatural twist, your worst fears await you in Room 1408.",1183939200,3,1843,4.906451612903226

7942490,5,B00005JPSE,"Mike Enslin (Cusack) makes his living by writing about haunted houses.  He is a skeptic, and his writings chronicle the lack of ghosts in these haunted places.  Next on his agenda is room 1408 at the Dolphin Hotel in New York.  The room  is a prime prospect for him.  The hotel has been around for almost 100 years and 56 people have died in the room.  The manager of the hotel (Jackson) strongly advises Enslin not to go into the room, but Enslin persists and soon finds himself in 1408 for the night.  Soon, he finds that he may have made a mistake, but my then the room will not let him go.

""1408"" is probably the best horror movie I have seen in a while.  It is even proof that a good horror movie can be made with a PG-13 rating.  This is all due to then fine acting provided by John Cusack, who must carry the movie all by himself for the majority of the film's running time.  Jackson is good in his small role as the hotel's manager, but this is Cusack's movie.  Based on the short story by Stephen King, this film is easily one of the best based on King's work.  I highly recommend this film.",1183680000,16,1101,4.161137440758294

The best line in the whole movie was ""You can check out but never leave the room! If you would like to try our express check out (a noose appears in all of the rooms)please let us know."" John Cusack's acting is his usual but the script lacked something worth acting for. Don't expect to see Samuel L. Jackson for more than five minutes!",1183593600,3,455,4.241379310344827
7942492,3,B00005JPSE,"Mike Enslin (John Cusack) writes books about haunted places. He doesn't really believe in the whole idea, but it helps pay the bills and allows him to live in Hermosa Beach and catch an occasional wave on his surfboard. His books sell well, but his celebrity is dwindling, so as he looks for a subject to end his current book, he receives a postcard from the Dolphin Hotel in New York City. ""Do Not Enter Room 1408"" the postcard reads. Mike's research reveals a number of deaths have occurred throughout the years in this room, room 1408 of the Dolphin Hotel. He calls to make a reservation and the room seems to be permanently booked. All of this naturally piques the interest of the disbeliever. He talks to his publisher (Tony Shalhoub) and the publisher's lawyer agrees to help. When Mike arrives, the manager, Gerald Olin (Samuel L. Jackson) tries to bribe, plead, threaten, scare and entice Mike to cancel his planned stay in room 1408. ""That room is evil"" he tells the writer. ""No one has stayed in there for more than an hour."" Mike won't have any of it and heads upstairs. As soon as he is in the room, Mike starts dictating his thoughts and notes for the book. Then, some strange things start to happen.

""1408"" is based on a Stephen King short story and it does something that few `horror' films do today. It is actually scary. The current trend in horror films, thrillers, what ever word you want to use to classify them, is to make them as gory and bloody as possible. ""1408"" builds a fair amount of psychological horror, scares that occur in Mike's mind, allowing our thoughts to fill in the details. This type of horror is always more scary than simply watching a bunch of knives, some blood, gory murders, the like.

Director Mikael Hafstrom, whose last film was my least favorite film of 2005, ""Derailed"", does a really good job of establishing Mike's character, his background, his current animosity towards his line of work, everything that would make him a skeptic. So when Mike enters room 1408, we almost believe what he believes, that he won't see anything, nothing will happen.

But then, there would be no need to pay $11 to see a movie called ""1408"" if that were the case, right?

The screenwriters, Mike Greenberg and Scott Alexander (Alexander worked on the screenplays for ""The People Vs. Larry Flynt"" and ""Man on the Moon"" among others) deserve credit for adapting the short story by Stephen King into a fairly well rounded feature length film. They add a lot of back story for Mike, help establish his skepticism by showing us a visit he makes to another haunted inn, and much more. They have filled in a lot of the details King only hinted at in the original story.

This is basically John Cusack's film. There are brief moments with Samuel L. Jackson, Tony Shalhoub, Mary McCormack and others, but once Cusack's Mike enters that room, everything is about what happens to his character and what his character does in response.

So it is important for the details of Mike's character to be established ahead of time. Hafstrom and the screenwriters have done a lot of this work, but without Cusack's performance, the film would fail.

Let's talk about John Cusack for a moment. Cusack is a remarkably underrated actor. Not an A-lister, he is, nonetheless, remarkably good. Sure, he has his share of missteps (""Must Love Dogs"", ""The Ice Harvest"" anyone?) but when he is in a film, I can almost always count on at least an interesting film which has been elevated by his performance. Yet in most of his films, Cusack's performance adds significantly to the overall quality of the film, delivering some quirky, excellent, memorable films. ""Grosse Point Blank"", ""High Fidelity"", ""Say Anything"", ""Being John Malkovich"" all contain a unique, quirky performance from Cusack that helps to elevate the film.

In ""1408"", Cusack plays Mike Enslin, a writer of books about haunted places. Throughout the film, we get further hints about Mike's past, his dreams, his failures, and these all help to contribute to his character. These moments aren't superfluous; they all mean something and add to the horror he later experiences. For instance, Mike doesn't really believe in haunted places, but the books he writes pay the bills, so he feigns interest and belief. Also, he once had dreams of being a great writer, and is surprised when a woman comes to a book signing with his lone fiction title, a much dog eared paperback that she wants him to autograph. The book's appearance is like a knife in his heart.

But the most important part of his past lies in his relationship with his ex-wife and daughter. Naturally, when an evil spirit is trying to drive someone mad, they will use the most precious memories that person holds dear to aid in the process. And evil, evil room 1408 is no exception. It knows all about Mike's past and uses this information to drive the skeptic over the edge.

Samuel L. Jackson is very good as Gerald Olin. He seems to genuinely care about Mike's welfare and doesn't want him to stay in the room. But the role is very small and the filmmakers do themselves an injustice by listing Jackson as one of the stars of the film. His role is really a cameo and if it had been billed as such, his appearance would help provide a nice little boost to the film.

If you are familiar with Stephen King's writing, he has written many short stories about things becoming possessed by evil spirits and haunting `reg'lar' folks. Dogs, classic cars, cats, toys, the like. Many of these stretch the credibility factor, but still remain very watch able. In ""1408"", a hotel room is possessed by evil spirits. And you know, it works. Because the film takes some time to set up Mike's skepticism towards haunted places, he enters the room a disbeliever. Since we are living this story through Mike, we also enter the room a disbeliever. Once he begins to experience the various freakish things, we feel the freakish things.

Virtually all of the horror in ""1408"" is derived from events or circumstances in Mike's life. And this makes the film all the creepier because it is slightly more believable. I can't really believe I am using this word when discussing a film about an evil hotel room, but there you have it. The film is believable for long stretches of time because we believe in Mike, and John Cusack's portrayal of the character. In fact, the film has very little blood or gore; there are a couple of shots of some of the other people who have died in the room but most of these are in black and white. And this is such a welcome change of pace from the current `norm'.

""1408"" was a big surprise.",1182988800,19,6634,4.654995730145175
