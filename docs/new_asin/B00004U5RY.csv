1354283,5,B00004U5RY,"The four episodes that make up the mini ""Oniwabanshu Arc"" are simply the best of the Tokyo Arc.  This is the conflict which caused Aoshi to lose his sanity.  Although the DVD doesn't include episode 8, the storyline is still strong and narration provides a brief recap of previous scenes.
In episodes 9-11, we are introduced to Takani Megumi, a young doctor who has escaped from the evil druglord Takada Kanryuu.  Working for Kanryuu, is the cold and handsome Shinomori Aoshi, leader of the Oniwabanshu.  It's up to the Kenshin-gumi to save Megumi from Kanryuu, but to do that Kenshin'll have to defeat the surprisingly skilled Aoshi.
The fight scenes between Kenshin and Aoshi are excellant and I love how Aoshi is portrayed as loyal and full of respect for his men, even though he's a ""bad guy"".  Actually, I just love that fact that Aoshi's in the story (he's my favorite character).  These episodes are must see to further understand the conflict Kenshin and Aoshi have in the Kyoto Arc.
Also, Episode 12 is a very nice episode concerning Yahiko's first fight protecting the meek Tsubame (I have no idea what her family name is).  Sweet humor throughout the episode, as Yahiko also deals with his first crush.",1076630400,,1213,4.77511961722488
1354284,5,B00004U5RY,"THis DVD happens to be very important to the later story, so if you started Rurouni Kenshin you kinda will want this one
all but the last episode are what I call the ""Oniwabanshu Arc"" it introduces Aoshi Shinomori and the Oniwabanshu, unfortunately it does have a tragic end to it....and one that sets the stage for the 4th best fight in the entire series
the last episode is taken from the magna, but isn't as important as the oniwabanshu part, but it does introduce Tsubame, who is Yahiko's version of Tomoe/Kaoru
overall its essential, so buy it :P",1062979200,,551,4.575757575757576
1354285,5,B00004U5RY,"It is a minor regret that Episode 12 of ""Rurouni Kenshin"" was not episode 8, because that way the four-part storyline begun in Episode 8, ""A New Battle"" would have all ended up on Volume 3.  In that episode we were introduced to Megumi Takani, a young woman descended from a long line of doctors who is now involved in producing opium for a drug ring, and Aoshi Shinomori, the former master spy and assassin, who is now the chief enforcer for the opium ring.  By this point the core group has been established around Himura Kenshin as he and Sanosuke take up arms against Aoshi and the drug lord Kanryu.  In Episode 9, ""The Strongest Group of Ninjas,"" Kenshin's group meets up with the fearsome warriors of the Oniwaban who call Aoshi their leader.  However, these battles are just a prelude for the main contest, an epic swordfight between Kenshin and Aoshi that involves all of the strengths of this acclaimed anime series.  This is a fight where who the two warriors are, how they were trained, and the very weapons with which they fight all matter.  This is not a quick and dirty fight but a classic duel of superior swordsmanship and the most memorable sequences in ""Rurouni Kenshin"" to this point in the series.
Episode 10 ""Fare Well, The Strongest Man"" reminds us of the old lesson that the enemy of my enemy can be a strong ally as both Kenshin and Aoshi are provided with a rude reminder by Kanryu that technology is threatening to make the samurai and his sword obsolete.  Unfortunately, despite the more adult and sophisticated turn these episodes take for the most place, we are still subjected to the cutesy anime pretty much every time Kenshin's interest in Karou is touched upon.  This same thing is employed in Episode 12, ""The Birth of a Boy Swordsman,"" where ""little"" Yahiko suddenly finds himself having funny feeling in the presence of the new girl working at the dojo.  But like virtually every woman in ""Rurouni Kenshin,"" this one has secrets and Kenshin and the others must let Yahiko fight his own battle.
Volume 3, ""Shadow Elite,"" is where this anime series proves it is a cut above the rest and one of those classic examples of animation that is too good for the kids at which it is supposedly aimed.  This is one anime that bridges the younger and older audiences.  In terms of the Extras this time around the Liner Notes offer only a few new Japanese terms (e.g., ""kempo,"" ""Kougen Ittou-ryu""), there is an art gallery, rules for a fan art contest (too late), trailers for other anime, and the original Japanese credits (the original lyrics are an absolute hoot).  I hear the series gets even better, which is pretty impressive given where it is at this point when we are only a dozen episodes into the saga.  Of course, it is hard to be a wandering samurai if you stay in one place, but that is just another minor matter.",1057536000,3,2849,4.573673870333988
1354286,5,B00004U5RY,"This DVD features episodes ('eps') 9-12, first season. All four are critical eps, insofar as they deal with important characters and/or feature highly distinctive and entertaining stories.
Eps 9-11 conclude the four-ep arc started in ep 8 (the final ep of the previous DVD), and the threat level against Kenshin & Co. continues to ramp up very satisfactorily.
Ep 9 is the weakest of the arc, in terms of flat-out action; but sets up the reason for the action in eps 10-11, and meanwhile it does feature the first solo fight of Kenshin's main sidekick, Sanosuke Sagara. Of particular interest in eps 8-11, is the introduction of Aoshi Shinomori (sp?), a fan-favorite villain/hero who (in these eps, anyway) is actually a better fighter than Kenshin! (Let's put it this way: Kenshin forces an impressive draw, and although he ends badly cut-up by Aoshi, he never managed to get his own blade through Aoshi's defenses.) Another impressive feature about this arc (and about the series in general) is that the villains aren't always entirely villainous. Arguably, these eps (along with ep 8 from DVD 2) comprise the best story-arc of the first season.
The 12th ep seems at first to be slightly disposable, but has its own unique charm: it's marks the first time that young Yohiko has gained enough strength to stand up effectively for justice by himself. A minor continuing character is introduced in it. It is 'canonical', in the sense that it comes from the manga, and future episodes refer back to it.
These episodes still feature one of the better end-title song/credit sequences for the series, 'Tactics' (although the actual words, when translated, are extremely dippy. |g|) The opening title song, 'Freckles', is still here. The 12th ep may feature the second end title-sequence/song for the first season, which I found to be less impressive. (Typical cheerful sappy J-Pop.)",1038787200,7,1876,5.016025641025641
1354287,4,B00004U5RY,This DVD has a pretty good fight scene with Hannya and a cheesy but very good duel between Kenshin and Aoshi. A must for an RK fan!,1024617600,,131,3.888888888888889
1354288,5,B00004U5RY,"The Rurouni Kenshin animated series proves that sometimes, the beginning of a tale is just as excellent as its other parts. Shadow Elite (3rd volume) introduces more of Kenshin's training, Yahiko's growth, and Sanosuke's gradual mellowing out (and yes, Kaoru gets to kick some a#* in this volume as well). I enjoy Rurouni Kenshin because regardless that Kenshin never seems to lose,the ways he learns to adapt to his opponents' techniques is fascinating. The storywriter, Nobuhiro Watsuki, manages to make Kenshin's winning realistic: the reason why Kenshin doesn't lose is because he never stops learning from his fighting, and never stops improving his techniques! While Kenshin's self-assured, he's not stupid nor hard-headed against his opponents and flexes to meet the challenges ahead of him. (Although Sano being hard-headed certainly helped in this volume....)
In this particular volume, even when Kenshin loses his sword, it doesn't make him an easy target (adapt/improve). And, we finally meet one of the more interesting good bad guys in the series: Aoshi (""He's So Beautiful, It's Frightening"" is the subtitle of one of the episodes). Having met Aoshi in a better mood during an anime club showing of the later episodes (somewhere waaaaaay down the line), I begin to see why the particular display of humanity in Aoshi in those episodes floored everyone!
I'm following the series volume by volume. Media Blasters has also improved the sound/visual quality of RK as well. Can't wait to see vols. 5/6/7!",1003708800,,1513,5.230452674897119
1354289,5,B00004U5RY,"You'll find out when he faces Aoshi Shinomori and his short sword. Not only that, Kenshin battles the mob boss armed with a gattling gun.",996019200,,137,4.52
1354290,5,B00004U5RY,"This is one of the good ones to own out of the Rurouni Kenshin series.  This finishes the little plot dealing around Megumi and her introduction, who later becomes Sano's eye-candy...  Anyway, it's a great DVD to own having some great battles and a vilan you want to kill yourself.  I recommed getting Battle in the Moonlite as well.  Also the Flames of Revolution is a great addition as it goes to detail a little more between Kenshin and Kaoru.  Kenshin can be a little like Tenchi universe at times, so do bare with it if you aren't familiar with Kenshin at all.  Samurai X is also about Kenshin, a little older and prior to his no-killing days.  I would also recommend getting the Samurai X motion picutre, same art as the Wandering Samurai and moving to the point were my mother cried... but she does that, a mother thing.  She also cried during this DVD, Shadow Elite, so go on and add it to your collection of Kenshin.  I wouldn't suggest starting with this one, it won't be confusing, your just missing some really good stuff in the beginning.",990576000,5,1051,4.489473684210527
1354291,5,B00004U5RY,"For those of you who've watched the first two discs and still wonder if the series is going to fall apart, don't worry. Kenshin is still going strong through these episodes.
It was also nice of Animeworks to increase the number of episodes on this disc from 4 to 5.",989539200,2,265,4.32
1354292,5,B00004U5RY,"This is honestly one of the best anime I've ever seen.  I loved the  animation, the characters, everything.  I loved this one especially, but  also the series in general.  It's wonderfully realistic.  Most anime are  whacky fantasies, which I enjoy, but don't feel for.  Rurouni Kenshin is  real, complete with the love, war, hate and strife that comes with real  life.  I am very interested in swordplay and fencing.  This is the perfect  series.  The animation is beautiful and you get an indepth view into the  characters and their fighting.  It's not just people hitting each other,  but logistics and reasonable weaponry with practical answers to each  amazing trick of the eye.  Keep in mind that the animators are not afraid  to show a bit of blood and gore.  This is not the best show for younger  viewers.  But the brutal beauty and sheerness of the violence itself brings  out something very rare.  Anime fan, or if you just want a good story, this  series is the best !",965001600,10,980,4.650887573964497
7923652,5,B00004U5RY,This is a winner if you want to see him fight aoishii a mediocre strength I still cant believe he was able to win like that. Aoishii technique was flawless.,1372809600,,156,4.233333333333333
7923653,5,B00004U5RY,"I was interested in the series which was view on TV. I enjoy collecting good anime, yet due to the economy purchasing the anime I enjoy from the retailer is not an option due to the value & price range of the items. I am gald amazon has reasonable prices & a wide range of sellers who can meet the buyers demand.  More impressed with the arrive time of the my order & how well the merchandise was package with care from the seller. Many times online purchasing can be rather hesitant but I am planning to make furture purchases with amazon & its vendors.",1360022400,,554,4.276190476190476
7923654,5,B00004U5RY,"Kenshin Himura was an assassin for the imperialist army during the revolution. At the turning point something happened and he just vanished. 11 years later he encounters a girl named Kaoru while wandering through Tokyo. He saves her life just before she is killed trying to fight a notorious murderer. He begins living with her at her dojo. They gain new friends and have many adventures, but one day ghosts from Kenshin's murderous past come back to haunt him. His gentle nature gives way to a murderous side and Kaoru must stand by him to keep him from changing forever.

The Ninjas led by Aoshi Shinmori are introduced in this volume. Aoshi Shinomori is one of the series most vital characters throughout. Not to menyion one of the coolest. This is a great DVD. The enemies and fights are awesome.

Rurouni Kenshin is an amazing anime series. Maybe even one of the best ever made. It has everything. Action, comedy, drama, suspense, romance, and mystery are all common themes in this anime. The amazing part is that it is based loosely on actual historical characters. The animation, voice acting, soundtrack, and plot are all very well done. There are dozens of great and unforgettable characters. This anime is a legend, and is a must see for any anime fan. It's also pretty family friendly. It has violence, but it's pretty conservative. All in all this show owns.",1353110400,,1370,4.776371308016878
7923655,1,B00004U5RY,"Wow. I have never had a product that has given me so much heartache and grief! Steam is literally shooting out of my ears with this product! This is the third volume of one of the greatest anime shows I have watched - Rurouni Kenshin. So take note that I love this anime, and the one star rating is not for the show, it is for this product.

My story starts with first purchasing the TV box set (economy one) of season one, which I was able to get for $30 at a used record store! I was super pumped! When I got to disc three I noticed one little scratch on it, but it didn't look that bad; besides I've had movies that looked like a cat played with it and they still worked. Needless to say after the first episode the disc started messing up. Frames would freeze and then start up in different spots. The dialogue would mess up as well and not match the voices. Also the picture would become distorted as if my TV was attacked by a nasty computer virus.

This made me mad, but not too bad, because I found a solution to the problem. Volume three, which is the product I am reviewing here, is the exact same disc in the economy box set. If you purchase the economy box sets you will notice first off one of the downfalls is that the six discs (at least in season one) have no numbers on them, so you have to guess which disc has which episodes on it. This is because the company that released this set must have literally took the same discs they used in the volume releases and stuck it in the box set. So I figured, ""I'll just buy volume three and replace it with my messed up disc!"" I found volume three first at a different record store for $8. It had no scratches yet at the same part it started to mess up. I should have recognized that this was a problem with the company and not the disc itself, but I decided to try again. I purchased a used copy of the same product off Amazon for around $5. It had minimal scratches, but again they weren't bad enough to render the product useless. AGAIN, the same problem occurred. So I decided to try one more thing. I put the disc on my Netflix and decided to see if their copy was messed up. And just moments ago I put it in my DVD player and again it messed up at the same spot, only allowing me to realize that yes there is a problem with most, if not all, of these discs, which the blame should be put on the company Anime Works that released this product!

I am super mad at the company. Its not fair to release something that doesn't work, and I am curious if anyone else who bought this product has had as much problems as I have had! Needless to say it has put a damper and distrust in my consciousness with Anime Works. Season two and three, which all are OOP, run up to $60-$80, and I will not buy them. It is a shame too, because this is such a great anime. I only felt the need to write such a vehement review because I don't want people to go through the same problems I have! Be warned!",1253145600,,2947,4.077586206896552
7923656,5,B00004U5RY,"So far, this series has been great, but in this installment, they kicked it up a notch. Especially because Kenshin and his friends get to face more challenging rivals, but also because the creators did a great job with character development. The wandering samurai shows what really drives him in his actions, and we understand what is important to him, which provides a striking contrast with the eagerness his opponents have for being recognized as the strongest.

A good portion of the four episodes in this disc center around the character of Megumi, a doctor that is staying with Kenshin and his friends, and who has a suspicious aura around her. The secret she holds is soon revealed and Kenshin has to decide on the approach to take. In this process, we will get to meet the Onibawan group, a ruthless bunch of henchmen with impressive fighting skills, who may be more complex in their motivations than it appears at first glance.

The first three episodes included in this disc have a pretty serious flavor, with lots of action and the usual philosophical aspects intertwined in the story, but the last one shows a different mood, with plenty of humor and a substantial component of romance. Things like this variety are what set this anime series apart from others. Of course, on cannot disregard its excellent plot and excellently developed characters, as well as the tension-relieving humor. I am eagerly looking forward to the next set of episodes!",1198368000,,1459,4.879032258064516
7923657,5,B00004U5RY,"Ruroni Kenshin: Vol. 3: Shadow Elite contains three terrific episodes in the (looooong) anime series about Kenshin, a wandering swordsman with a mysterious and violent past, and Kaoru, a young lady who runs a doujo.  Other friends have joined the gang, the handsome fighter-for-hire Sanosuke and the scrappy orphan Yahiko.

Episode 9: Strongest Group of Men - We learn about Megumi Takane's past, the terrible secret she is keeping, and whom she is fleeing from.  The Oniwaban group of ninjas are out to kidnap Megumi and bring her back to her ""employer,"" Kanryuu.  Kanryuu has hired the Oniwabans for this purpose.  The leader of the Oniwabans is Aoshi.  He is the only member of the group who is not grotesque-looking; in fact he is quite handsome.

Sanosuke fights Shikijou to try and save Megumi.

Episode 10: Aoshi - Inside the mansion where Megumi is being held and considering hari-kiri (suicide), Kenshin fights the impressive Hannya.  With his demon mask and red and black striped muscular arms, Hannya looks like an ancient demon out of Japanese folklore.

Episode 11: Farewell, Strongest Men - Aoshi and Kenshin battle.  Aoshi is extremely agile and inflicts damage on Kenshin.  Aoshi tells the story of the history of the Oniwaban group, and how they now have no place in society because of their freakish appearance and lack of any skills besides fighting.  You feel a lot of sympathy towards them.

The vile Kanryuu interrupts with a monstrous invention - the Gatling Gun.

Episode 12: Birth of a Boy Swordsman - This is all about Yahiko, and his first real battle.  He is smitten with a young girl newly employed at the neighborhood restaurant Kenshin and his friends frequent.  But the girl has been placed in the restaurant for a sinister reason.

This episode is lighter than the deadly serious ones mentioned above.  The end of the episode is hilarious.  I watched it over and over!

Extras are a smashing art gallery, liner notes consisting of the cultural and historical background of some names and terms featured in the episodes.

Note: If you are a girl, prepare to sigh/drool when you go to ""Setup"" on the menu.  There is the best picture of Kenshin, and some haunting romantic music.  I just stared and stared!",1114992000,,2236,4.854497354497354
7923658,5,B00004U5RY,"As another reviewer has mentioned, the producers of the English language version of this series missed an opportunity when they left the episodes in their original order.  Episode 12, The Birth of a Boy Swordsman, is excellent on its own.  It is about Yahiko's first steps to maturity as a member of the Kenshin extended family when he meets a young woman whose past thrusts Yahiko into a conflict with a gang of ruffians who might very well be the end of him.  Unfortunately, because the first three episodes are part of a story that started on the previous DVD, episode 12 feels out of place with its radically different mood from its fellows.

The first three episodes, and the last episode from the previous DVD, make up a story arc that begins when one of Sanosuke's friends dies as the result of using a 'new' kind of opium.  In the conflict with the Oniwaban ninja that follows, Yahiko is poisoned, only to be rescued by Megumi, a doctor who turns out to have been responsible for the opium as part of her servitude to one of Tokyo's crime rings.

This puts Sanosuke in a conflict between gratitude and a desire for revenge, but Kenshin senses Megumi's inner quality.  In no time at all, Kenshin and Sanosuke are at war with the Oniwaban, who want to prove they are the best fighters in Japan - over Kenshin's body.  What starts out as a war with evil turns into a battle for honor in which we quickly learn that sometimes the apparent villains aren't the real bad guys.  In the final clash the real enemy turns out to be greed and the creeping influence of the West over Japans future.

As is usually the case, the writer's make excellent use if the ussues that really were meaningful during the Meiji restoration of the middle 19th Century.  The influence of the West, and the dissolution of the Tokugawa Shogunate created many opportunities for both ill and good.  Opium and modern weapons both came with a high social price, and Kenshin, although a loyalist, was one of those who felt that new times do not have to mean an end to social responsibility.  What is special about this series is that it makes this backdrop meaningful in a personal context as it works its way through the group living at the Kamiya sword school.  For Western audiences this is both a delightful series and an excellent introduction to some of the key forces in Japanese history.",1104796800,,2368,4.567375886524823

Kenshin is not sure why this man is even here with these people. I am sure you already know that Kenshin wins of course all the main characters in all movies or anime win, Unless u are like 6 you should know this well 6 year olds shouldnt be watching this any ways.

He was greatly feared by all and anyone who met up with him perished to his blade but then suddenly he dissapeared and for years at a time noone knew what became of him. The meiji era is now in effect and swords are illegal except those carried by officers. Kenshin Himura the wandering samurai was once that legendary man slayer and as atonement for his sins he has sworn to never kill again so he carries around a reverse blade which is a sword that uses the dull side with the sharp side facing in. However bad habits die hard and evil seldom fades so now kenshin must protect his new found friends from that evil.
