8436507,5,B004N7THXM,"A tormented woman's passion and courage - to reclaim her freedom & stature and bring to justice a misogynistic serial killer while befriending, aiding, rescuing, and making love to an investigative reporter in his own exhaustive hunt for the deadly truth - reigns supreme in the now classic Millennium Trilogy (in Swedish with sub-titles). Directed by Danish filmmaker Niels Arden Oplev for Yellow Bird Films; Mikael Blomkvist (played by Michael Nyqvist) and Lisbeth Salander (played by Noomi Rapace); original three novels written by the late Swedish mystery novelist Stieg Larsson and superbly edited by Eva Gabrielsson. We are easily swept up in the complex, hyper-intriguing hunt by our heroine Lisbeth for a serial killer presented in a stunning sequential order of unfolding events and plot twists - that hold one almost in amazement at times.

So much has been written about these tightly-woven films and their positive impact upon women and girls around the world, their influence on the romance-thriller genre in novel writing & screenwriting, their ferocity to tell a high-end story about a pair of fiercely intelligent serial killers and still keep it reigned into a powerful but digestible film storyline, and their tenacity to reel in the sub-plots and multiple plot endings into a precise denouement along a superior crescendo or ascending mode of action with an original wildly-filmed plot. Depth of character, sustained plot tension, and powerful, realistic acting performances dominate each film in such a way - that we want to see them again.

Once in awhile we see these brilliant, pro-women, pro-active film trilogies take off and make their way into multiple languages - as if all along they were meant to be translated at breadneck speed throughout the world - so one and all - women and men - can drive a long distance to catch one or two of these films in sequence at a single movie theatre. And we are talking about movie goers going out in perhaps severe weather condition to see any one of these cinematic masterpieces. Realism, honesty, thorough journalistic practices, true mystery & suspense scriptwriting & storyboarding, sado-masochistic & erotic side-plots that tightly weave like electrifying eels returning to their comfort lair - back into the original storyline - all create an experiential type of cinema - that becomes exhilarating, challenging to the senses, sensual, and intensely played out for our enjoyment and enrichment.",1333152000,,2466,5.209068010075566
