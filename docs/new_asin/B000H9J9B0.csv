8137737,5,B000H9J9B0,"After serving six years on nuclear submarines in the sixties, this was my first look at modern submarine technology. During the time I served on submarines, I felt that the Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine represented a significant amount of all the progress man had made in science and technology. But now, looking at this documentary on the USS Virginia class nuclear attack submarine, all I can say is ""Wow!"". The improvements are impressive! The documentary presents a realistic portrayal of modern-day submarine technology, as well as the highly trained crews that man the submarines. The quality is excellent. Highly recommended.",1224979200,5,636,5.37
