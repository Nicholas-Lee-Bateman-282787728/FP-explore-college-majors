8363078,5,B002C40REQ,"Life through the eyes of those that witnessed Jesus in his lifetime, from childhood to the resurrection.  This amazing one man performance colors Jesus in his many traits from trials as a child, to friends of his disciples, to one with power to cast out demons, to the great healer, to the savior and sacraficial Lamb, and to the King of Kings.  This video will have you laughing, shouting for joy and crying your eyes out.  A great tool for teaching teenagers and young adults and a reminder to all how AWESOME is our GOD!",1301961600,,523,4.484210526315789
