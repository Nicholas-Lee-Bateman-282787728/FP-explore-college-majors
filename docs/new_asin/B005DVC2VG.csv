8467616,5,B005DVC2VG,"Dad continues to be wrapped up in WWII info - he was a teen during the War - and this was a great addition to his collection:  it's one thing to know about the battles, but another thing entirely to hear about them from the people who were there.

Ordered for his birthday - came right on time!

Would do business again with this vendor.",1511222400,,337,4.153846153846154

8467618,5,B005DVC2VG,Jarod did a wonderful job on the documentary.  It was wonderful to hear the stories of those who were there.,1367193600,,108,4.4
8467619,4,B005DVC2VG,"This DVD contains valuable interviews with the brave men who fought to keep the freedoms that we continue to enjoy. The men in this video, if they are not already gone, will be soon, and their insight and stories of what really happened during the war should be kept in the forefront of everyone's mind. Our grandchildren need these stories so they can understand the personal sacrifice of their great grandparents. Definitely worth the purchase!",1348963200,3,446,4.96

8467621,5,B005DVC2VG,Even if you're like me and don't like documentaries this film will catch your attention.  It really conveys the experience like you're sitting down with each veteran and hearing their stories for the first time.  The film has a great balance of everything from funny stories to serious moments.  Even watching it for the second or third time I picked up on things in their stories that I didn't catch before.  We Were There is certainly a great addition to any library.,1311465600,,469,4.682926829268292
8467622,5,B005DVC2VG,"We Were There completely caught me off guard.  I have spent the last 20 years listening to these men tell their stories and had thought I had heard it all.  This video reminds me how naive that thought is.  Listening to these men tell what they had been through reminds me that everyone of them has a unique story.  The videos strongest point to me it poignancy.  It has the feel of capturing men and women who really want to tell us now what they could not tell us for years.  Above all, I did not feel down once it was over.  So many documentaries of late have left one feeling depressed about seeing this generation passing into history.  We Were There made me feel more proud than anything.  Proud to say that the people in this video saved the world and made some amazing memories in the process.  I highly recommend this as both a great collection of stories and a wonderful teaching tool to remind the current generations that there is nothing free about freedom.",1311465600,5,970,4.429378531073446
