4673002,5,B001EFN584,"One of the first live concert videos released in the 80's age of music videos, this is in fact a live concert performance by Gary Numan on his first big tour, and it is MUST HAVE for 'historians' of avant garde 1980s New Wave/New Romantic music. The brilliance of Numan has ALWAYS been underrated (forget ""Cars"", seemingly throwing him into the category of ""one-hit wonders""); this man has over the past three decades released some of the most unique and profound music available.  He has explored many genres with each release, while at the same time creating music never heard before and impossible to categorize.
However, this extremely rare VHS concert footage is among the best you will ever see - and more, HEAR -  played live.  While Numan himself is one of a kind and outstanding, the stage set is awesome, but it is his backing band that is the REAL TREASURE. Only the best for Numan, and he KNEW who was the best backing musicians to assemble for this tour - mainly the keyboard/synthesizer/violinist BILLY CURRIE (known during and soon after as the keystone of Ultravox and Visage). Numan's version on this concert tape of the old chestnut ""On Broadway"" - which at first seems a very strange song choice for this 'futuristic alien new wave artist' - is one of the greatest renditions of this song ever recorded.  This is due mainly to Billy Currie's MIND-BLOWING synth solo that many Numan, Ultravox, and Currie fans consider his single best performance ever recorded.  It is jaw-dropping.
But aside from that life-changing portion of this rare gem, Numan delivers all you'd expect, and then some, considering this concert and its set, musicians, and overall on-stage performance, are vastly beyond its time of 1979/1980.  Next to Blondie's ""Eat To The Beat"" video album recording Numan's ""The Touring Principle"" is the greatest live concert performance of its time.  An EXTREMELY rare VHS tape to find in good, watchable condition (I am fortunate to have a decent original copy, but only dare to watch it once in a decade maybe, for fear of destroying the tape), and finding a good condition copy of it even at $125 is worth every penny.  Just treat like a DaVinci painting and view it rarely; believe me, once every few years will remind you of how brilliant Numan was and is.  All of his life shows on video are outstanding (he really goes all out for his live shows), but you will never see Numan and Mr. Currie in 1979 - in one of their many respective musical pinnacles  - creating what should be considered a Masterpiece of the 'birth' of New Wave/New Romantic music with Numan's own singular style expressed - which has influenced dozens of those who followed.  Spend the money - buy it - and be blown away.  A MUST HAVE FOR ALL TRUE 80s music students/historians (of which I consider myself, as I was THERE for it ALL) and...all I can sum it up as is BRILLIANT on every level and in every way.",1425772800,,2913,4.66796875
4673003,2,B001EFN584,"This has to be THE most disappointing dvd ever released by Gary Numan. Don't get me wrong; the performance is top-notch, but the sound and picture are below par to put it mildly.

The setlist is fantastic  comprised mainly by songs from their last album, which is formidable IMO. The gig clocks in at a healthy 97' and the energy level is sky-high.

First surprise : The return of the mighty Steve Harris, ON BASS GUITAR ???!!! Why ????!!!!!!!! OAH, amateurish ex-bassist Tim Mudimann on guitar duties replacing  the competent Gary Mc Cormack ?!. How in hell did this happen ?! And a new keyboardist replacing Rob Halliday ?!

Picture : the filming is like a 97' MTV clip;  lighting fast editing, strobos blinding the cameras and no more than a split second at a time wasted on a musician at a time. Lighting goes from stark-white to total darkness to a bluish hue, so forget about noticing any detail. The variable pic ratio is very poor, peaking at a meagre 7.6 Mbps and often descending way below the kerrap zone 3.5 Mbps mark, which is inexcusable for a double layer DVD. WTF authored this abomination ?! Did I mention the almost omnipresent GRAIN and fuzziness that plagues the pic ?! I watch my SD DVDs on a big CRT TV, not an LCD so I can only imagine how badly would the pic break up on one of those !!!

Sound : the usual lossy DD 2.0 instead of a full-fledged LPCM one, again inexcusable when there's so much available room on the DVD. I personally don't care about surround mixes on concert DVDs, but most people do these days and Gary has not bothered with these on the last several releases. If only the stereo sound were well mixed !! The guitar sounds only on the right channel and Fenton's keyboard on the left channel can't be heard at all. I had to switch to mono to get an even soundscape and as a result guitar volume dropped to inaudible , devoiding the mix of the necessary aggro; what a shame !

Numan DVDs are a hit or miss affair; one release has astonishing quality and the next is appallingly sub par.
If you have to watch this, just borrow it. You will feel cheated if you cough up your hard-earned on it. OAN, I'm a HUGE GN fan. I'm not a no life bitcher, but I will not buy another Numan product blindly.

 Buy at your own risk, or better yet, COPY it from a friend's. The word CHEAPSKATE came to mind as soon as  pressed the play key.",1378080000,2,2365,4.328054298642534

Film: 5 Stars - One of the best music documentaries ever made. An intimate look at a complex man/musician
Video: 4 Stars - I wish they'd released it on BluRay (if not 4K), but for a regular DVD the video quality is outstanding
Audio: 3 Stars - Audio is a rather clean 5.1 Dolby Digital mix, but I had to turn my receiver up way higher than usual

8469711,4,B001EFN584,"If you are big Gary Numan fan like the reviewer bargainhunterva . whose review of this new DVD documentary was posted earlier, you will definitely want to get this DVD.

Me, on the other hand, am a general record/music collector who only know of Numan from his mega hit single in the 1979 (when he was age 21)   Cars (it hit #9 in the US and his iconic look (not unlike David Bowies Ziggy Stardust period). But seeing his name on the package brought back that single, as though I heard it yesterday. I love music documentaries and so this was of particular interest to me. I want to know what Numan was up to over the last 40 years. I certainly learned that since the two co-directors  Read and Alexander  practically moved in with Numan, his wife (who started as his fan club President) Gemma (who seems to change her hair color from blond to black to red or pink, every other day) and their three young daughters. We start in England, where Numan has hit a creative wall in his writing and decides to move everything to California. He gets some gigs sitting in with punk bands and starts working on a new album. Splinter. That album took seven years to create and we are there along the way until itd final release at an Amoeba Records store. Yes there is some nice archival footage of Numan in his heyday  as I remember him  but there are also a lot of (in my case, probably too much of ) just living room or family road trip chats. Numan used a lot of his early money earnings to buy a plane and fly. But the filmmakers love to show new landscape shots made from a plane flying upside down under bridges. Cute once, but they do a bit too often).

The DVD contains 5 short (1 to 5 minute) bonus scenes which total about 10 minutes. And, at least for me, they didn't add much.
So, Im glad I saw it and Bargainhuntervas review will serve the Numan fans. For the rest of us I can only give it four stars. Theres more personal stuff here than youll want watch. I should also point out that there is no nudity in the film but certainly lots of graphic language.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8469712,5,B001EFN584,"I've been a fan and have followed Gary Numan since late '79. I won't even go into how much I love his music or how it has changed my life because the past is not what this video is about. It is about his move to the US, his desire to reach more people with his music and the battles he fought to release Splinter- his most recent studio album.

The DVD follows Numan from his quaint English cottage to his magnificent Gothic mansion in La La Land. The story evolves and is told by various people including Gemma (his long time fan turned wife- pronounced Jemma), himself and even his three young adorable daughters. Steve Malkin ( I do hope I got his name right!) is also interviewed, as a long time writer/publicist for Gary, as is Ade Fenton, his current producer/collaborator.

Gary has really struggled throughout his working years. Those past struggles were briefing described as well as the most recent time, which seems to have started with the falling out with his father, who had worked with him from the very start. Listening to Splinter, one can sense some of his angst because, as Gary learned, he had to start creating music from his own life and experience, warts and all, and to keep his own unique voice and vision.

Splinter is a dark album, but that is where Gary was at the time. His music turned out to be cathartic for him. This leads the viewer to a happier more optimistic ending and one I found myself cheering for. As an artist myself, I found his story inspiring. I immediately wanted to play his discography album to album; back to back to be inspired and motivated toward my art with a renewed sense of freedom, as Numan himself seems to have done.

This is a very personal story filled with moving scenes and brutal honestly. But, it is not all dark and foreboding. There are many light moments and candid scenes with soul mate wife. One really gets the sense of how close they are and how hard those hard times were for them as a couple. I was really rooting for them.

If you are an old fan, this dvd will bring you up to speed with a dear friend. If you are a new fan you will get an honest perspective as to how and why Numan creates the music that he does.

I anxiously await his next album and wish Gary the greatest successes as he certainly deserves them.",1489968000,10,2292,4.368544600938967
