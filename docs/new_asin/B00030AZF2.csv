8035637,1,B00030AZF2,"So I decided to watch this on Prime because hey, why not give it a chance?  I've seen plenty of low budget clunkers on Prime, could one more hurt?  Some of the reviews seemed obviously fake... friends, family, cast, etc... but what the heck, why not.

I wish I had spent my time banging my head against a wall or cleaning litter boxes instead.  And yes, watching it DID hurt.

Debbie Rochon is way above the rest of this film, as she does a decent job acting, but that's really not saying much.  The rest of the acting is amateurish at best.  The direction is inept.  The parody is clumsy.  The writing is very poor.  The lighting, visuals, editing... weak.  It comes across as a big ol' ball of morbidly unfunny tedium.  Worst of all, IT'S NOT FUNNY.

The best thing about this is that it's pretty short.

Avoid this unless you like self-inflicted abuse.  Rarely has a movie made me long for a lobotomy like this one did.

As for the positive reviews, R. M. Gatling said it best in his/her review... ""To give this dvd a vote higher than 2 means one of four things.
1. You haven't actually watched Mulva 2.
2. You starred in Mulva 2.
3. You gave Chris Seaver money to shoot Mulva 2/Friend of Chris Seaver
4. You are Chris Seaver.""

BTW, when I was done suffering through this schlock fest, I recalled at the beginning where screen text said this was the 22nd movie by this director.  The mind boggles.  I don't see how that's even possible, considering how awful this one is.  Then again, if it's his 22nd low budget disaster, I can understand why... nothing in the previous 21 was likely to get him a shot at the Big Leagues.",1490745600,2,1626,4.3566666666666665

8035639,1,B00030AZF2,"There are no words. Well, just a few. First, I must admit that the acting, the dialogue, the special effects, and the camera work is much better than ""Mulva: The Zombie Killer"" (Mulva 1). Still, this movie is still pretty horrendously bad. It was done with writer/director Chris Seaver's camcorder (he has now upgraded from the generic camera in Mulva 1 to a Sony in this movie).
Mulva 1 was slightly, very slightly, more entertaining, because, although the camerawork was pitiful and the acting idiotic, it was somewhat funnier in its stupidity in a twisted kinda way. Mulva 2, almost put me to sleep. One must note that the character of ""Mulva"" is played by a different actress. Debbie Rochon, who now plays Mulva, was also in the first film, playing another character. This movie is pretty badly acted, directed and written. So, unless you are very very bored, and like low-budget films that were done in someone's garage, you should not watch or buy this. I mean trash with better camera work is still trash. I did find myself smirking at some idiotic lines and scenes, so the movie is a bit entertaining.

PLOT: this movie is a spoof of ""Kill Bill"". Mulva comes out of a 5-year sugar induced coma and now watch revenge on Teenape, who was jealous of all the fame Mulva got after ridding the city of zombies in Mulva 1, and all the ones involved in the plot to hurt her. When she wakes from her coma she notices that she has changed (a joke about how there is a new actress), she has grown up, filled up (she now has breasts), has long straight hair and lost her lisps. She proceeds to go on a vengeance rampage. This is definitely not for the easily offended; there are tons of sexually explicit references, scenes and jokes.

The DVD: This is not worth purchasing. There is really no value to it. Just rent it, but don't buy it. The Special Features are limited and not that good.",1202774400,2,1886,4.511695906432749

Words that have no meaning in the film Mulva 2.

To give this dvd a vote higher than 2 means one of four things.
1. You haven't actually watched Mulva 2.
2. You starred in Mulva 2.
3. You gave Chris Seaver money to shoot Mulva 2/Friend of Chris Seaver
4. You are Chris Seaver.

Whatever the writer/director/guy in blackface, Chris Seaver was on when he decided to waste more  money on this ""film"" (I use the term only because a cheap camcorder does count as film), he should share with the rest of the world. Maybe then people outside of his circle of friends would find his films as funny and amusing as they do.
Oh, don't forget! The people who starred in this film ,who gallivant about the internet posting positive five star reviews!

It happened to be those very same reviews that tricked me into believing this was a partway decent film. Good work.
I wish someone had been honest about their review of this film , because then I would have not wasted my time or rental on it.
Let me make a couple of things clear. Don't assume that people are hating on this film for no reason, there are 62 minutes worth of reasons to hate this films.
This movie does have a message:  No matter who endorses your film, no matter how much money you have , no matter who stars in it, a poorly written , produced and directed film is exactly what it is.
There is nothing funny about this movie , between Seaver in Blackface and  the poor audio work, you either don't hear the jokes or you've stopped paying attention.

If you don't believe me on how bad this movie actually is, look at the ""Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought"", there you'll see movies that are on par with this movie,"" Unwatchable Garbage""
Deadlands the Rising, Filthy Mc Nasty (another Seaver film.) Quest for the Egg Salad ( another awful seaver film); But if you enjoy poor excuses for independent films, you're welcome to purchase/rent this.

Just don't say you weren't warned.",1195689600,9,2051,4.564032697547684
8035641,5,B00030AZF2,"This is the second LBP I've watched, and I had a better time than with any number of expensive Hollywood 'blockbusters'.  Here's what you gotta do: ignore the lack of actual sets and other normal movie stuff, and accept that Teen Ape is a guy (at least, I assume so) wearing an ape mask.  Let Go Thy Preconceptions that an entertaining film means the film makers having to spend actual money on it.

If you like South Park and the Simpsons, odds are, this is for you.

This is a parody of the Kill Bill movies, but far better than any number of Saturday Night Live sketches.  It's fair to say I got more laughs per minute with Mulva 2 than I did out of a whole Saturday Night Live show.  Part of the laughs come from it all being an injoke.

I liked the Kill Bill movies, by the way.

Mulva 1 (which I am halfway thru) involved a delightfully dorky girl, a continual chocolate smear on her lips, who goes out for Halloween night to get her beloved candy.  Unfortunately, there are some zombies in the way.  That film was amateurish--the acting is, uh, variable--but that's part of the charm.

In Mulva 2, five years have passed.  Mulva was put into a coma by a fiendish gang of, well I'm not sure of what.  When she wakes up, she wants revenge.  When she wakes up, she is also a different actress.  Apparently the original actress was not available, so Chris Seaver, the writer/director, got an actual actress from Troma Films (and who was in the original Mulva in a secondary role), Debbie Rochon.  No offense to the other actors, but Rochon clearly has experience & tons of presence.  She has exactly the right tone: she takes none of the film seriously.  There is also a running gag about how the more statuesque Rochon has ""filled out"" while being in a coma.

There isn't much of a plot, so don't worry about spoilers.

Basically, Mulva goes through Bill's (Teen Ape's) evil crew, and finally reaches him at the end, for a showdown.  Along the way, Seaver deftly parodies key scenes in the Kill Bill films.  Somehow the lack of money adds to the fun.  And there's plenty of gore--people lose their heads, and I don't mean emotionally--but it's so silly it becomes a great joke (as opposed to the serious violence in Kill Bill).

And, at about 65 minutes, Seaver moves the film briskly along.  It simply does not have time to drag.

This is recommended for anyone who does not have a Teen Ape up his/her butt, and can get in on the joke.",1170806400,6,2440,4.414798206278027
8035642,4,B00030AZF2,"ok let me start off by saying I would have given it 5 stars and it realy does deserve 5 stars if only it had been the original actress. . MISSY DONATUTI playing MULVA but alas they couldn't get Missy so they went for the ever beautiful and amazing DEBBIE ROCHON, and used the 5 year coma she was in to explain the transormation.. and yeah I love how they joke about her being a WHOLE NEW MULVA throughout the movie.

Ok where to start..

Chris Seaver writer and director has said that his original idea for MULVA II was to have MULVA face off with the Wolf-Man, The Frankenstein's Monster, Dracula, The Mummy, The Creature etc. in a MONSTER SQUAD style film using the original actress MISSY DONATUTI.. when that didnt' happen he dropped the idea completely then was asked later by TEMPE video to do MULVA II and asked for some ideas.. he pitched the idea I just mentioned as well as a KILL BILL parody... they liked the above idea so of course he opted to do the KILL BILL parody.. I would love to have seen the other idea and can only hope for a THIRD mulva..

on to the review..

if you've seen theoriginal MULVA you know how overacted and obsurd everything can be as well as the low budget and quality of the film and effects used.

MULVA II finds us with better quality video, effects and actors.  Sticking somewhat closely to scenes from KILL BILL done only the way CHRIS SEAVER can.. I guarantee you'll love every minute of this..

DEBBIE does a great job mixing the original MULVA's personality with THE BRIDE from KILL BILL and the other actors rock making fun of the varios characters from Kill Bill.

The end fight scene with TEEN APE.. if those remember the boring ass dialog rich final climax between the BRIDE and BILL never fear this is not boring..

this one grabs you by the bloody balls and runs for the hills..

They completely drop the KILL BILL parody and start TRIBUTING another famous VERSES BATTLE! I'm not going to say which one.. but yeah...

you'll like it..

CHRIS SEAVER does it again..

It's AMAZING

uhm.. yeah MULVA III come on!",1145664000,2,2059,4.427055702917772
8035643,3,B00030AZF2,"First off, if you're expecting Kill Bill, well just don't.  This is ultra low budget filmmaking the LBP way.

There's a world of cinema that exists just outside of Hollywood, Sundance, and Cannes.  It's a world of truly independent cinema, a world of Troma, of ifilm, of Low Budget Pictures.  This is where Chris Seaver lives and makes movies.  For Chris, the films aren't about huge budgets, amazing acting and technical wizardry, but entertainment made by fans, for fans.  If this flick makes you laugh, Chris did his job; if it didn't and you didn't like it, then that's fine too.  I'm sure Chris would be happy just knowing you gave it a try.  At the end of the day it really doesn't matter what anyone thinks, Chris does what he loves doing, and does his best to make a living doing it.  Can anyone really ask for more?

In this sequel to Mulva: Zombie Ass Kicker, we find a brand new Mulva just out of a sugar induced 5-year coma.  Her lisp is gone, her ears are pierced, and man did she ever grow some boobs.  Her mission?  To track down and kill those responsible for stealing five years of her life, and her bag of Halloween candy too.  If you're at all familiar with the LBP world you won't be disappointed.  We get to see everyone from Heather and Puggly, to Bonejack and Teenape, and a very special appearance by a guy who very nearly looks like the pumped sax-playing rocker from The Lost Boys.  There's a ton of in-jokes (Plastique anyone?) and a ton of Kill Bill influenced sight gags.

What surprised me the most what for all of Chris's supposed technical disinterest this is the best-looking LBP feature ever. The editing and titles are worlds better than before, and the opening sequence (mirroring the opening of Kill Bill) is in my opinion of very professional quality.

Everyone in the cast turns in very fun, entertaining performances, in particular Jason McCall and Meredith Host (who pulls almost triple duty).  Debbie does a great job channeling a weird mixture of The Bride and the previous Mulva, to make a very fun new character that for once IS the hot chick on the cover of the box.

If ultra-low budget filmmaking, guillo-dildos and fart-beheadings are your thing, this won't disappoint.",1111104000,7,2218,4.624040920716112
