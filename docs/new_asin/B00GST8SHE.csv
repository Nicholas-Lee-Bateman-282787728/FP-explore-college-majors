I very much enjoyed using this dvd.  She had some unique moves I have never seen before (candle dipper was my personal favorite).  Nothing has finally gotten to my abs quite like Pilates.  Whenever I start out as a beginner, after a couple of workouts my abs stop feeling sore and never get sore again. That did NOT happen here.",1523318400,,497,4.417582417582418
