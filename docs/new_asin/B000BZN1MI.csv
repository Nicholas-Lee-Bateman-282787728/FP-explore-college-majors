8094917,2,B000BZN1MI,"This review is for ""Prostitutes Protective Society"" only:

The tales of the harsh life of the hooker, are almost as old and well-worn as the actual profession itself. The 1960's were a hotbed of such films. ""Prostitutes Protective Society, "" while just one of many such offerings, has an interesting flavor, even though it is far from the best this sub-genre has to offer.

The story here revolves around Madame Sue and her bevy of brothel beauties, as they run afoul of some low-rent gangsters who are trying to muscle in on their profits. When the girls fail to capitulate and hookers start turning up dead, Sue and her clan arm up and bring the fight straight to the guys!

These no-budget crime sexploitation films are a dime a dozen. But what helped this one to stand out from some others I've seen, is the sheer amount of brutality in it. While certainly tame, even laughable, by today's standards, back in the mid-60's this was no doubt very shocking. Watching the hookers as they are killed one by one was very sadistic. One of the worst examples was the first killing, where the girl and her john are machine gunned down right in the bed. Not to be outdone, though, the girls get their revenge in the end, as the gangster boss ends up getting ""Bobbited."" Such visceral assaults help to break up the dullness and monotony of the rest of the film.

Barry Mahon, who wears many hats in this outing (listed as director, producer and cinematographer) is no stranger to this brand of film. He really gives you a good feeling of the seedier side of this lifestyle and vocation. Some excellent scenic shots of 60's NYC really helps to give you a good visual display of the world in which people such as this dwell. Some of which, I'm sure is to accommodate the complete lack of a budget.

Of course, the violence and atmosphere aside, this is far from a good film. While the scenic shots are great, there is just way too many scenes of watching the girls and gangsters just walking around town. It drags the scenes between the violence to a slow crawl. This wouldn't be an issue, if the actual story had some truly interesting aspects to it. But there are the many segments where the budgetary constraints take you out of the moment. One scene that exemplifies this, is when Madame Sue and a couple of her girls ""go to the country,"" as they plan how to take out this gangster boss, which consists (I kid you not) of them laying nude on their bellies in a pile of sand on the floor. The acting skills of the cast is pretty much non-existent, as well, which is only belabored by the fact that many of the girls walk around topless in many scenes, where nothing sexual is even inferred (much less shown), including multiple shower scenes. The girls have no problem peeling for the camera, even though the sexual content reasoning for them to do so is very minimal. So, flesh fiends will certainly get more than their share here. It's just an obvious shortcut to generate interest, in a plot and script that has little of such to offer. The dialogue is laughable and the delivery of it even moreso. Cue card reading at it's finest, I'm sure.

In the end, ""Prostitutes Protective Society"" isn't a film that will appeal to many. Genre fans will probably be able to derive some entertainment value out of this, thanks to it's seedy vibe and violent panache. Those who are not already cineophiles of this stuff, though, would do well to stay away from this outing. Only die-hard grindhouse sexploitation fans need apply here.",1375574400,,3518,4.567353407290016
8094918,4,B000BZN1MI,"There are actually three shorts: The Hookers, Prostitute Protective Service & Meeting on 69th Street.

Some people are pretty critical of these grindhouse films - not sure why. It seems the criteria should be pretty straightforward:

Are the women attractive?
Is there enough nudity? (well, female only)
Is there girl on girl action?
Film resolution quality accetable to good?
And a bonus, does the plot make sense?

For these three, you have to say yes on all checkpoints for all three shorts (each about @1 hour long). The Hookers one is really comprised of three ""chapters"" and three different un-related stories of prostitutes. It should be noted that Image Entertainment which distributes the Something Weird compilation DVD's will on occasion edit them ... I can't imagine they edit for time, only on content so one of the Hookers short stories has a couple jarring edits so I'm not sure if we've lost a little or a lot - did not see the original VHS (pre Image Entertainment editing). But still pretty nice but you have to wonder.

PPS is big scoped storyline of prostitutes defending their Times Square turf against the mob. Big cast, cool Times Square b-roll of that era, lots of action and lots of nudity - nice.

The third featurettes not listed is 'Meeting on 69th Street"" - also about an hour long - about prostitutes who open up their own house of ill repute (without pimps) on ... you can guess the street. Solid & plenty of nudity.

Not the best compilation but all pretty solid. All b&w. There might be trims in the first story but the women except for the first girl are all smokin' (and not the cigarette kind) so good enough.

Plus the usual fun assortment of trailers and mini featurettes (about 10 in all).",1202342400,16,1728,4.683168316831683
