1066578,1,6305763356,"This movie was previously entitled ""my father is a hero"" and it is terrible. The plot is stupid and the cineatography is terrible even on DVD.  The martial arts fight do not display Jet Li true talent.  Avoid this  movie.  If you really want to see a great Jet Li movie that displays his  awesome martial arts talent, get ""Fist of Legend""  that is his  best movie and believe me, you will not be disappointed.",956707200,4,409,4.373333333333333
1066579,4,6305763356,"This is a well done movie, the little kid is fantastic, I just wish he had shared more fight scenes with Jet. The female cop sent to find him is also very good, their scenes show an underlying friendship/love  and admiration. Very well done and one of my fave Jet Li flicks..",956016000,6,275,4.288461538461538
1066580,3,6305763356,"Before buying this movie people should know that it is the same movie as My Father Is A Hero. Having said that, this movie was OK. Jet Li and the kid have one fight sceen each and then they have one together at the end. I  watch martial arts movies because I love to see the fight sceens, and this  movie just dosen't have enough fights. The story however was pretty good  plus Jet Li is in it so I couldn't give it less that 3 stars.",953596800,9,434,3.9655172413793105
1066581,4,6305763356,"Although much of this movie was spent on character development and plot-setting (i.e. the dying wife), and that Jet Li's fighting prowess was only a small percentage of the action sequences, I have to give this movie  a high rating.  The storlyline was easy to digest: Hong Kong policewoman  (Anita Mui) pursues undercover Mainland cop (Jet Li) who's helping to bust  a crime lord (effectively portrayed by equally amazing martial arts actor  Yu Rong-Guang).  Martial Arts prodigy, Xie Mao (as Jet's son), livens up  the screen with his genuine artistry.  Be prepared to sit through some very  ""slow"" scenes but you will be rewarded with incredible action.",943228800,5,656,5.05607476635514
1066582,4,6305763356,"This is the second movie, the boy plays his son. The action is 4 stars and Anita Mui is wonderful, as always. Kinda sad story, a good father/son story and a great fighting scene with the big ending.",915321600,,198,4.2368421052631575
1066668,1,6305763356,"This is a terrible release of a terrible movie!
For those fans who have watched Jet's movie career go from the sensational Shaolin Temple and Once Upon a Time in China series, it was this movie (along with the Defender) that marked the beginning in Jet's dramatic decline.
This movie is actually called My Father is a Hero, it has been dubbed and cut for American audiences. It is no wonder that many martial arts films are considered plotless and characterless when the US distributors cut them so only action is left!!
The martial arts action is way below par, the kid is more annoying than Macauley Kulkin, and the bad guy's include Ngai Sing, Ken Lo and Yu Rong Guang! These are some great martial artists and the encounter with Jet should have been breath-taking, but there are too many wires and it's a limp finale overall.
buy the asian import of My Father is a Hero, rather than support these butchered US releases. Or even better buy Jet's classic movies (most things pre-1994) + and the Hong kong edition of Fist of Legend",1048550400,4,1032,4.583783783783784
1066669,2,6305763356,"This movie was ok, but da dubbing ..., and thanx alot to ""Dimension Home Video"" they re did da sound effects of da movie and it was capital B ""BAD"". Trust me, if u wanna get dis movie on VHS or DVD, get da orginal one ""My Father Is A Hero"", itz in itz original language (since I never saw da original, I think da original language is Cantonese, either dat or Mandarin) and da sound effects have gotta be better. I saw da dubbed version of ""Once Apon A Time In China"" and compared to da original version (Cantonese) I saw da original is WAY better",1017705600,3,546,4.11214953271028
1066670,3,6305763356,"This is a very odd story and is hard to follow.  Jet Li plays an undercover agent (police of some kind) who is assigned to infiltrate an organized crime gang headed by a ruthless martial arts master who is played by one of the worst actors I've ever seen.  He is excellent in the fight scenes though and quite often surpasses Jet Li's skill.
Jet Li's young son is also a junior kung fu master and longs for his father's return home from frequent trips.  His mother has become very sick recently though, and this only makes it worse.
This movie is worth seeing for the fantastic fight scenes, but the plot is too odd to even consider.",982022400,,633,4.3474576271186445
1066671,3,6305763356,"Wow, the only good part of the movie was Jet Li and the kid that played his son in the movie (sorry cannot recall name).  It had a few good action scenes but if you are looking for a good action movie by Jet Li check out Fist of Legen or Twin Warriors.  Those are my two favorite Jet Li movies and they are a must see for every martial arts fan.  Good try Jet, but stick with the good scripts and you'll get a better critique next time.",972777600,2,436,3.8764044943820224
1066672,5,6305763356,"I have seen this movie several times in Chinese and English.  The translation is different in both.  The Chinese actually makes everything  more clear (I know the translaters have to consider the mouth  movements.....so understood).
The sentimentality, in my humble opinion  is good (although acting it out seems difficult for Xie Mao in one spot).  I don't really care for ""tear jerker"" movies, but if you love  your family (something I think is dying out), it is very believable!
The  fighting action is awesome!  And I have to say I believe Jet Li has the  true ability to portray feelings perfectly.",967161600,4,603,4.881188118811881
1066673,1,6305763356,"I remember when I first saw this movie (subtitled) and I really enjoyed it a lot.  I really enjoy Jet Li films but since I already have the movie, why  would I buy this version?  Well, due to Jet Li's popularity, I wanted to  see what Dimension Films had up their sleeve.  I just had to checked out  how a dubbed Jet Li movie would be.  Now, all I can say to Dimension is...  Please add the original language version with English subtitles.
  The  first strike was the lack of features and the second major strike is the  lack of the HK soundtrack and only released dubbed.  Sure, I could buy the  Tai Seng version but this was upsetting because I am not a big dubbed fan  but then again, I have seen a few good dubs in my life and possibly, this  movie might be one of them....wrong.
  This really cool movie was  replaced by horrendous dubbing, a bad transfer where you can see the film  scratches and the DVD has no major extras.  I'm just lucky to hear the 5.1  surround.
  I could still watch through the movie and enjoy it but I  like the movie and the storyline.  Why they changed the name to ""The  Enforcer"", I don't know.  Maybe they felt, ""My Father, The  Hero"" was weak...not sure.
  So, if you had to buy a certain  version, spend a little more for the Tai Seng version of this movie.  This  movie deserves to be watched in its original Chinese language and if you  can't understand it, watch it with English subtitles.",964396800,4,1431,4.271698113207547
1066674,5,6305763356,"I could not make it all the way through the movie without going back  through the chapter selections just to view the fighting scenes, which were  actually better than the ""Matrix"". The young boy and the Inspector also  gave the movie an extra flavor of martial arts. I would recommend the movie  to anyone who enjoys martial arts.",958953600,,331,4.655172413793103
1066675,4,6305763356,"This film is actually ""My father is a hero"". This is a great film since it has a touching plot. Jet Li is a hidden hero who is unveiled throughout the plot. Good fight scenes and terrific story.",957916800,,194,4.131578947368421
1066676,3,6305763356,"This is the second release in the Jet Li collection by Dimension Home Video and where its first release Fist of Legend suceeded The Enforcer fails.  First off, Jet Li is magnificent in the few fight scenes he is in,  and the movie My Father Is A Hero (The Enforcer) is one of Jet's better all  around films.  However Dimension seems to have sped up Jet in his final  fight scene in this release and the music and revamped sound effects do not  always coincide.  I would have given this film a four stars if not for this  shortcoming.  Fist of Legend was beautifully done in this aspect to bad The  Enforcer didn't follow suit.  Hopefully Twin Warriors (Dimension's next  release aka Tai Chi Master) will learn from its first progenitor rather  than this one.  This still does not encumber the beauty of Jet's kinetic  and irresistable screen presence.",956707200,10,851,4.617449664429531

7893971,4,6305763356,Jet Li has many many movies.  This is one with a good story and lots of action.  I'm glad I got this dvd.,1357776000,,105,3.5217391304347827
7893972,3,6305763356,"The original title of this film ""My Father is a Hero"" describes it best.  The movie is about Jet Li playing a father, who is sent undercover on a top secret mission to infiltrate a mob boss - who is one very cold & cynical guy.  The mission is so secret, not even his wife and son are informed, and it breaks the heart of his son (who is obviously very close to his father in this film).  His wife dies of illness while away, and he fears his son is in just as much danger, when he comes to H.K. looking for his father and also becomes entangled with the mob boss.  There are plenty of touching scenes in the film, mostly about family and loss, but leave it to poor English dubbing to ruin the moments.

As with most Jet Li films, you can expect a good deal of action with this one.  And unlike his American films, you can expect even more action and longer fights.  The only scene that really amazed me was the finale, lasting 7 minutes where Jet Li takes on the boss and his men on the inside of a large boat.  The action kind of gets ruined once his son comes in and father uses him as a yo-yo on a rope to take out the guys.  Its quite funny looking and obviously totally unrealistic.

The movie didn't flow too well for me, as it proceeds from action to tender moments, back and forth.  Just didn't feel right in this film.  I might have enjoyed it a little more if the dubbing wasn't so poor.  Not a very exciting movie oveall except for some decent action from Li.",1187654400,2,1471,4.101398601398602
