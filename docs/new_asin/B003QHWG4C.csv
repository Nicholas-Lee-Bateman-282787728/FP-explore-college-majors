8402299,4,B003QHWG4C,"The program glances over Rachael's childhood and gets in-depth starting at the early part of her career when she began working at Macy's and then later at a gourmet deli store.

There's plenty of interview segments with Rachael's mom as well other people who were important in the early rise of Rachael's career. From past footage, before she became famous, you can already see the charisma and infectious charm that would propel her to eventual stardom.

The DVD itself is a bit light on material, with only the main Bio program running at about 47 mins with no extra features. It would've been nice had they included some of her early Albany segments(before she was discovered by Al Roker) as a bonus feature.

The price on Amazon varies(depending on the seller), but I was able to pick one up for under three bucks(with free shipping), quite a deal. Overall this is an insightful program covering Rachael Ray's life and career but lacking in any bonus material.",1350086400,,964,4.795180722891566
8402300,5,B003QHWG4C,"DVD was exactly what I expected except that the sound was low on the show. And it had blank tape where commercials would have been on tv. The company could have tightened the video before marketing the product. Still enjoyed the Biography. Learned a lot
from it.",1342742400,,262,4.595744680851064
