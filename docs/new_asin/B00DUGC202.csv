5856270,5,B00DUGC202,"I consider myself at an intermediate advanced level of fitness.

I own two others in this series and I usually do them on my ""take it easier"" days.  It still makes my muscles burn and I can work on flexibility but is not high impact.  I like that the instructor counts for most of the exercises and the piano music is strangely relaxing while you burn.

This one surprised me --- I usually wear my low impact bra for these but with all the jumping around in place, I should have gone for more support!  I worked up a decent sweat with this and was pleasantly surprised that it had delivered on the cardio name.",1382054400,4,610,4.269565217391304
5856271,5,B00DUGC202,"This workout is so fun because it makes you feel like you are dancing! It is certainly effective in getting the heart rate up, and it is also broken up into a nice mix of exercises that are challenging but manageable.",1381536000,2,217,4.317073170731708
5856272,5,B00DUGC202,I love the Ballet Beautiful workouts and this one is another great addition.  Mary Helen combines toning with spurts of cardio mixed in and makes 60 min. and a healthy workout fly by fast without putting strain on my body-- thank you!!!,1380931200,,236,4.619047619047619
5856273,4,B00DUGC202,"If you are looking to jump around like a cheerleader and do all kinds of fancy dance steps, this is not it.  I have exercised off and on all of my life and consider myself ""reasonably"" fit for a 50 year old.  I am no pro but have tried a lot of home videos and this one doesn't require a lot of skill but keeps you moving without a lot of crazy jumping.  There is some, but it can be lowered down if your knees are not the best, as are mine.  You do feel ""more graceful"" after doing this workout.",1379980800,3,496,3.881188118811881
5856274,3,B00DUGC202,"I am so disappointed about this video. After LOVING her ""classic"" workout and most of her ""body blast"" set, I pre-ordered this and looked forward to doing it for days. Maybe it's my fault, I'm not sure what I expected out of a ""cardio"" workout, but her other workouts are so specific and toning and this one just isn't doing it for me. The footwork is complicated, like ballet I'm sure, but I struggled too much with the moves to get my heart rate up. I could do it several times and get the hang of it maybe, but it seems like my time (and anybody else's who is having this problem) would be better off using the time doing other cardio.

Also, without dance training and very specific instruction on how to do each move safely, some of the things in this workout just don't seem safe to do repeatedly. The moves are higher impact than were in her other videos and the odd landing in the plies caused pain in my knees. I'm not mobility impaired or anything, I'm just a normal person, but like a lot of women, I have some lingering issues with my knees that I have to pay attention to. Part of why I loved her other videos so much is that they were challenging but never hurt my joints or made me worry that I even could. They were very gentle but also very effective.

Maybe this workout is more like other ""cardio"" DVDs, but if you are buying it on the basis of her other workouts, you should know that there are some big differences. So, be advised. I'll give it three stars because the production value is good, it does seem to be in keeping with other available workout DVDs, and pretending to be a ballerina was pretty fun. The moves are graceful, even some of the stretches, so that was a nice change.",1379203200,86,1708,4.284829721362229
5856275,5,B00DUGC202,"Obsessed with the other two ballet beautiful dvds so I had to give this a try. It's really good and i'm loving it.  No dread about doing it which is how I usually feel about cardio.  This is not the hardest cardio ever but at this point I'm not a cardio junkie anymore.  I much prefer to do yoga and barre so this one works for me.

The moves are pretty basic. Took probably the second time through to get all of the footwork accurate. Provides good bursts of cardio then you break out into toning abs, arms and inner thigh. If you are familiar at all with the other dvds the toning has some similar moves with new stuff as well.  I find that the hour goes by real quick.",1379116800,9,671,4.091603053435114
5856276,4,B00DUGC202,"Cheese and Rice!!!  Ok, I am not a student of ballet nor am I twenty-something.  I own one other Ballet Beautiful DVD and enjoy the short, but challenging workouts as part of my fitness program.  I consider myself to be in decent shape, but this is brutal!!  Damn, woman!!!  Mary Helen Bowers (perfect name for this prima ballerina) is so sweet and adorable and she quickly goes through the exercises, but don't like this sweetness fool you!  She is a ballet Nazi!  I guess I am going to have to work up to the intensity level in some of the segments.  Having a little ballet knowledge is helpful, but not necessary.  I would recommend watching it first, before trying to take it full on.  I don't know what I am getting myself into, but I accept the challenge!!!",1378425600,28,763,4.463768115942029
5856277,5,B00DUGC202,"I just got done doing this workout for the first time -- and loved it!

I've had wonderful results using Mary Helen Bowers'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B008XBLCMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful Total Body Workout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Body-Blast/dp/B00AATOHPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful Body Blast</a>&nbsp;workouts together (which I liken to the results that many get from Tracy Anderson's workouts, in terms of the lengthening and tightening that you get), and had been eagerly awaiting this new one, which I pre-ordered from Amazon a few months ago.  (In my reviews for those two other DVDs, I've mentioned the positive results I've gotten from doing Mary Helen's workouts in the past; when I was doing just those two workouts and no cardio, I lost several inches.)  I'm really pleased with this new one, and know that I'll be using it a lot!

When you go to the main menu, you have the option of playing either the entire workout or individual chapters.  Whether you choose the individual segments or the whole thing, you also have the option of playing the workout with Mary Helen's voice + music or just with the music.  This is a nice feature since the counting on her other two DVDs can be a bit repetitious after doing the workouts a few times.

The individual segments (if you choose to do them one at a time) are:

*  Warm-Up (about 8 minutes)
*  Core Workout (about 11 minutes)
*  Upper Body (about 16:30 minutes)
*  Lower Body (about 13 minutes)
*  Total Body (about 11 minutes; this is really the last cool-down stretch)

The entire workout comes in at 62 minutes, and all you need to do the workout is a mat.  The music is classical piano music, and it's more upbeat than the music on her other workouts, which is nice since this has a cardio focus.

The workouts are filmed in the bright, white loft that is similar to the backdrop used in her other two workouts.  Mary Helen uses ballet shoes to do the workout, but you could probably be barefoot and be fine.  (I use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capezio-Women-s-Daisy-Ballet-Shoe/dp/B002CQTY84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capezio Women's Daisy Ballet Shoe</a>&nbsp;when I do Mary Helen's workouts to feel a bit more ballerina-like! :-) )

The cardio segments/bursts (what Mary Helen calls ""Allegro intervals"") on this are mixed in with mat work, so it's not a pure cardio workout, where you'd be doing cardio for an entire hour.  On the back of the DVD case, it mentions that these are designed to be ""high-intensity cardio intervals,"" but they aren't as intense as other HIIT or cardio workouts.  That being said, the cardio bursts still got my heart rate up during all of them.  The cardio moves that she does all have a ballet focus, and include things like leaping in place and doing hopping plie lifts.  Mary Helen will have you doing a few minutes of these cardio bursts, and then you'll get on the floor and do a toning segment that focuses on a body part (abs, arms, or legs), before moving into the next cardio and toning segment.

If you like ballet-inpsired workouts, I'd also recommend Leah Sarago's Ballet Body DVDs or Tracy Mallet's barre workouts.  While Leah's and Tracy's workouts have a more athletic feel to them, they focus in similar ways as Mary Helen's workouts on lengthening and developing lean muscles.

Overall, this is a nice cardio workout that will fit in nicely with her other two Ballet Beautiful workouts!  I always feel graceful when doing her workouts, and love how lean and lifted I feel afterwards!

UPDATE ON 3-18-15:  If you need more of a low-impact cardio workout, then I'd recommend the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Swan-Arms-Cardio/dp/B00S02R1G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Swan Arms Cardio</a>, which just came out last month.

5856278,5,B00DUGC202,"So you think ballerinas are delicate little flowers who don't know the meaning of hard-core sweat? Think again, friend. Yes, ballerinas are graceful and get to wear sparkly costumes, but these people are serious athletes. Mary Helen Bowers is one of those long, lean, elegant types, but in her toning and cardio videos, you get a glimpse of the strength, control, and mind-body connection necessary to make it all look easy. There are other ballet workouts out there, but what is particularly refreshing about these videos is that Mary Helen, a professional ballerina, is actually really down-to-earth: she knows just how hard she's asking you to work, because she's right there with you, panting and occasionally admitting that even she is getting tired. The attitude with which she approaches the exercises -- of the ""yes, they're challenging, but I know we can both do them"" variety -- is so inspiring, and the lovely music and set (when was the last time you saw palm fronds in a workout video?!) really helps you focus on moving not only correctly, but beautifully. The best part, of course, is how effective this and the other Ballet Beautiful videos are -- I kid you not when I say that they will actually change the shape of your legs, arms, and core. No bulk here, just lean, graceful muscles that will have you pining after a sparkly costume or two.

To be clear, the video has been available on iTunes for a while, which is why I have been able to review it before the release date.",1377993600,24,1493,4.698473282442748

The Cardio Burn DVD is an amazing new addition. I was ready for something more, an intense workout to keep me inspired, get my endorphins going and push my body a little harder - and this is it! It really took me to the next level.

Cardio , then stomach toning on mat. Cardio and the arm toning on mat. Cardio and then leg toning on mat. et cetera . This helps burn fat , and lengthen and tone muscles. Being dedicated to the ballet beautiful dvds will have your body feel more graceful in movements. I have used over 6 months. My muscles are lengthened and toned which keeps you feminine not bulky. Huge change in posture and confidence within . I am feminine , toned , happier , and alive ! If you have issues with your thighs , also try Body Blast dvd and Total Body Workout. TBW: butterfly bridges. BB: both leg workouts. on leg workouts, modify if the burn is to intense. Eventually you will get there. It took me some time without having to stop and rest.

It's very hard to do this -- particularly the ab section when I haven't been able to stretch before .. and there is no real prep/warm-up for each workout. Some  of each workout includes real ballet moves and that's what I expected. I am not a ballet dancer... I am ok with Pilates and Barre workouts.. but this is much harder than the hardest Barre workout or Pilates workout that I have done.  It assumes some knowledge of  ballet.

5856308,3,B00DUGC202,"I am really conflicted about this DVD.  It is not a bad DVD, and it does have some good qualities, but it is titled in a somewhat misleading way.  I'll get to all of these in due course.  Full disclosure: I am not a ballet dancer and I bought this because I thought it would add something new and different to my workout routine.  I am a longtime user of home exercise DVDs, however, and know a lot about what works there and what doesn't.

First of all, some comments on the instructor.  She speaks clearly and is easy to understand.  I can tell she is a knowledgeable dancer.  She seems friendly.  But she is a dancer, not a fitness instructor.  So there are some ""off"" things about the instruction:

*the cueing really isn't there; she transitions to another move and you end up a few steps behind because you don't always know what she is going to do next

*she frequently says things like ""go get some water"" but doesn't give you any time at all to do that (you have to put the DVD on pause or miss some content) -- not even if your water is only a few feet away from where you are working out

*she uses ballet terms without explaining them (I had no idea what 4th position was, for example, and I'm still lost on a French term she uses over and over) and there is no description of *how* to do these things, so even though I now have a vague idea of 4th position from doing the workout, I have no idea if my form is anywhere near correct

*she says ""right"" and moves her right side (it is much easier to follow along in exercise DVDs if you can mirror the instructor's movements, which would mean she moved her left side when she said ""right"")

*she jumps right into stretching before warming up (bad idea and could lead to injury) and the stretches and what muscles they are supposed to be working are not adequately described, nor do you have enough time to do the stretches to actually feel any benefit (seriously, for all but the cool-down segment, blink and you will miss the stretches)

Music is Beethoven piano music.  Volume is appropriate, as is the music choice.  It's simple and not distracting.  You have the option to work out to the music, alone, and that basically is just the same as the workout with instructions only with the instructor's voice on ""mute.""  Studio is an upper-floor exercise studio with tasteful, non-distracting decor.  You may want a yoga mat if you are working out on a hard floor, but if you are on carpet, you may not need it.  Instructor was wearing little slippers but I did this in bare feet since I do not have similar slippers.  There is some jumping so you will want padding (a padded yoga mat was sufficient for me).

I had some issues with the camera work.  For a large part of it, the camera work was fine.  But there were times when the camera would move and you wouldn't see, say, the instructor's lower body during a footwork segment.  For non-dancers like myself, it is important to be able to see the feet/legs at all times, and to see them in relation to the instructor's upper body is even better.

On to why I think the title was misleading.  This is subtitled ""cardio fat burn.""  I bought this expecting to get a one hour, mostly cardio workout.  This is not a cardio workout.  I did not even get 2000 steps on my Fitbit in an entire hour using this workout.  (In fact, I could get more steps from ""Walk Away the Pounds"" for a half hour, or from marching around during the breaks between sets in a P90X strength DVD.  I use steps per unit time as a rough approximation of how good of a cardio workout I am getting.  2000 in an hour is very low.  I ended up having to run on my treadmill for 20 minutes afterwards.)  You do *maybe* a total of 15 minutes -- total -- of cardio during this entire DVD.  And that is split into four segments of from maybe 3-5 minutes each.  You almost begin to break a sweat but you never actually drip sweat like I would expect during a good cardio workout.  It doesn't really even count as an interval workout, because the intervals are more than 10 minutes apart.

As for what cardio there is, the four segments share some moves but are slight variations on each other.  They involve jumping so I'd classify them as high-impact.  The arm movements are quite repetitive, the leg movements less so.

So what is this DVD?  I suppose it is more of a ballet conditioning DVD.  If you think of the cardio intervals as a way to warm up and give your muscles a break, well, they are better in that context.  You do a lot of repetitive movements that will work certain parts of the body a great deal, and some of those are good:

*the arm movements in the cardio segments are brutal on the tops of the arms, so you should get good toning there

*similarly, the cardio segments use the calves a lot

*the triceps get worked pretty hard during the upper body portion

*and the inner thighs get worked pretty hard during the lower body portion

But the toning is uneven.  Although the triceps were worked a lot, the biceps, chest, and back weren't.  Although the calves and inner thighs were worked a lot, the glutes, hamstrings, and outer thighs weren't.  Etc.  For what it's worth, the stretch at the end is quite good, although it really needs a bit more focus on the upper body.

If you are looking for a varied sort of ballet workout containing both dance moves and toning segments, this is a very good DVD -- especially if you already know some ballet techniques and terminology.  If you are a beginner, you would want some instruction elsewhere before attempting this.  If you are familiar with the instructor's style and have done other Ballet Beautiful workouts, and liked them, you will probably like this as well.  If you are looking for a good cardio workout, though, look elsewhere.  Right now I am just not seeing myself doing this one very often and I can't figure out how to fit it into my usual rotation.",1447891200,4,5905,4.372242647058823

I won't go into detail about the breakdown of the DVD and the moves, as there is already an excellent review outlining all of that (thanks Leanne!) :) I don't have a streaming membership for Ballet Beautiful so I only have the other DVDs to compare this to. First of all, the 15-minute Swan Arms workout in the Body Blast DVD has always been my absolute favourite upper body workout. I did this workout almost every day (as an add on to my other workouts or even on its own on rest days) for approximately 6 months before my wedding two years ago and really saw my arms tone up. I was therefore very excited at the release of this Swan Arms Cardio DVD. I held off buying immediately as I had just bought a bunch of new workouts at the time of release and wanted to try waiting for a price drop. Now that I finally have it, I am very happy! :) I didn't really know what to expect as I knew this couldn't be a 60-minute version of the express Swan Arms workout with just arm work, and I am pleased with the way the workout is set up. The standing work is fun and easy to follow. I definitely felt the burn in my arms from working them throughout and as mentioned by some others, the leg work is much simpler to keep up with than some of Mary Helen's other DVDs (Cardio Fat Burn and the standing portion of Sculpt & Burn Cardio). I do not have any ballet experience and was tripping all over myself in the previous workouts, but I was able to follow through with the choreography on my first try this time. The mat work is quite typical of Mary Helen's style with some ab and thigh work. I did feel a nice burn all over after I was done and was nicely sore the next morning (my arms were actually quite weak.. lol), which is always my way of knowing that I got a good workout! I agree with some of the other reviewers who said that this is not Mary Helen's most challenging workout and it is not full of new material, but I still liked it enough to give it 5 stars :) This will be a nice workout for a lighter day and I will definitely be reaching for it often.",1442534400,7,2155,4.133333333333334

5856316,2,B00DUGC202,"I give this two stars only to draw attention yet again that this is a high impact workout. If you are already doing jumping jacks, you will find Mary Helen's beautiful dance moves a fun and pretty variation on the jumping jack theme. I almost returned it and wish I had as I have been avoiding high impact exercises. Mary Helen is still great though. She intersperses her jumping moves with mat work to break things up. I don't see myself using it much, although of course a beautiful well done production.",1441584000,,506,4.510869565217392

5856319,5,B00DUGC202,"My friend Leanne (who does the best reviews on Amazon!) told me to get some of these DVD's and so far, this one is my favorite. I'm 47 and love really hard workouts; the harder, the better. The past 3 years, i've become hooked on barre classes. I consider myself strong but i was begging for mercy during the tricep portion of this. I was yelling at her, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW!?"" It was that hard. I finished it but not without cursing. Same with the inner thigh section. The ""Allegra intervals"" were challenging too but i added 2 pound weights in each hand to up the calorie burn.

""Swan Arms"" isn't on this DVD but that's another section where i could not believe how hard it was! After 2 minutes, i was like, ""OK~she can wrap this up now..."" and i had 13 more minutes to go!

5856326,5,B00DUGC202,"This is a high intensity cardio DVD. This is especially helpful for women who are more serious about losing the actual weight rather than the toning/sculpting of her classic DVD. I always sweat like a pig whenever I do this, which is great, considering I've been using this for almost three months. There are bits and pieces of some strength training in here, but it's not as intensive as her Total Body Workout one. You will be jumping with Mary, and she will be so nice to you while you are sweating and crying. If you want my suggestion on losing weight, I suggest you do this DVD and the Sculpt & Burn Cardio Blast, a low-impact cardio DVD together. Remember that strength and weight training helps with overall body fat and size, while cardio helps with lowering your number on the scale. You need both for successful weight loss; you cannot do one without the other! Cardio without strength/weight training can make you lose weight, yes, but then you'll still be flabby and become ""skinny fat"". You can do strength/weight training without cardio, and while you'll become firm and toned... you might not like that your number on the scale isn't budging. You need both, as well as eating a clean diet.

This is a wonderful DVD, I am so happy to have found Mary Helen Bowers, and she makes me feel good about being a woman, you know? I never appreciated the hypermasculine aura that I've seen in the gym scene, and maybe I don't want muscles or to 'bulk up'. Mary's workouts will NEVER make you bulk up or make you look odd. I love her so much for that. Zooey Deschanel is one of her clients, and she always looks so feminine yet in shape, you know? :-)",1435881600,8,1656,4.483443708609271

I started using BB videos over a year ago and have loved how I can get a great workout that focuses on elongating my muscles and toning those specific ""ballet muscles!"" The cardio is pretty intense in this video so you definitely get your heart rate up! But MHB also combines some targeted exercises to focus on some serious toning! Good burn for your butt and thighs for sure! This video is very doable for those who don't quite have that ballet body! I had no trouble with any of the positions.

Even though it says cardio, the cardio portion is short.  I got more out of the toning portions.  The arm section is killer!  Even with no weight, your shoulders will burn.  The legs will also leave your thighs and buns on fire.
I found the core section to be the least difficult, but I do Pilates daily, so maybe my abs are stronger than my arms/legs.
Overall a great toning DVD and I would highly recommend.",1430524800,3,554,4.339805825242719

5856336,1,B00DUGC202,"I was so excited about getting and doing this workout after reading all the rave reviews and success stories!  Let me start by saying that I am a huge Jillian Michaels fan and I lost about 35 lbs. using her workouts.  But, along with a lot of the other reviewers, I was ready for something different- something slower paced and just a different approach to working out.  So I read almost all (or maybe even all) the reviews for Ballet Beautiful, and was so motivated to try these workouts!  I started with the Total Body DVD, then added the Body Blast one and this one and I rotated through them 3 - 4 times per week for 12 weeks, and ..... I GAINED 5 LBS. and my jeans are tighter!!  I am so bummed!!  I know, you're thinking I ate too much, but NO - I REALLY watched what I ate, knowing that there's not a lot of cardio in these workouts so you have to be careful.  Now, from experience, I usually gain a few pounds at first when I start a new workout, but then after a couple weeks, my weight returns to normal.  I kept hoping that would happen but it didn't.  And I'm usually not one to just go by the scale, I'd rather judge my progress by how my clothes (especially jeans) fit, but when my jeans start getting more & more snug, I ain't happy!!   I guess this type of work-out isn't what I should do with my body type.  I don't know if I should give it more time, like continue using these workouts for another month or two and see what happens, or just switch back to my beloved drill sergeant.",1429660800,4,1500,4.1522491349480966

5856338,5,B00DUGC202,"Another ""big hit"" from Ms. Bowers. I love the allegra intervals and that they are at the beginning of each segment so you can get your heart pumping before you go into the target mat work.

As usual, the music is compatile and she is so beautiful and lovely to watch.  I always watch the DVDs first from the couch before beginning them and by the time I am done watching, I am ready to give it a shot.  It does take some practice getting used to all the fancy, but neat and cute, footwork, but it's well worth it to learn the steps.  Just rewind and go back over all the trouble parts you may have and nail them.  Eventually, you will master the intervals and do the cardio non-stop and with perfection.

My guy likes to watch me and says I actually look like I'm dancing... am I really dancing?  LOL!  I wish!  :)  Well, maybe I am... *heeheehee*",1429315200,,847,4.204968944099379

The mat work on the previous DVD's is much more in depth and longer - I find I can only do about half the workout and I'm still sore the next day or so. That said, I love having all the cardio options to do regularly and then add in the mat work more slowly. I guess this DVD has been too easy for some, but Swan Arms Cardio has to be my favorite. It's challenging, but not so much that I can't do the entire workout. It's a great full body workout and left me with trembling muscles.

I'm in decent - not amazing - shape, and I felt like it was a pleasant challenge for my fitness level. I loved that the exercises moved my whole body almost the whole time. There were some moves that took a little more coordination than I have. I won't be able to do them and reap the full toning benefits from them until I've practiced them some more (honestly I felt like I was trying to rub my tummy and pat my head at the same time), but the cardio was still enough of a workout for me that I felt like it was worth it. I also really loved holding poses at the end of a sequence. But my favorite part of it all was the elongated stretch component. This is something I've wanted more of from Ballet Beautiful workouts, so I'm glad to see stretching both in short bursts along the way and a more thorough stretch at the end. As far as variety compared to other BB workouts? I have never done any of the online workouts, but I have all of her DVDs except the prenatal sets. I can't speak for others who subscribe to the online workouts, but for me as an exclusive DVD-doer, this will be a really nice addition to my workout collection.

This one is great for those who can not jump or do high-impact cardio: you will basically do plis (both and one leg), tendus, degags etc. There is a good cardio aspect in this DVD - you will get your heart rate up from moving your arms and from many degags and also from pass moves. It seems to me that here you will be able to tone the muscles around your knees and all around your legs as well (although I am not sure about the calves). It is very lovely idea to use the arms all the time, even during the mat work! - which is great for engaging your back muscles throughout the workout. The mat work is rather short, but has good abs workout and I like also the stretching part. Overall, it is a great DVD to have in rotation. My four stars are just because this workout feels like a collage of older ones (like Swan Arms cardio online video plus cardio with plis) which I do not mind strongly, but was expecting something really new.",1425513600,11,1044,4.173267326732673

I subscribe to Ballet Beautiful's online custom workout and was afraid this workout would be very similar to the swan arms cardio streaming video there.  It's different, and I like this DVD version much better than the streaming swan arms cardio video on balletbeautiful.com.

I'm kind of clutsy by nature and found the cardio challenging, as it has a lot of balancing on one leg and lifting your arms up at the same time.  It's a great series of exercises to work on core stability and balance, which is one of the areas I'm currently focusing on.  I'm sure I will get better with some practice.

The mat work wasn't the hardest I've ever done but felt just right given that the cardio portion was difficult for me.  I also enjoyed the longer stretch at the end.

Mary Helen is a joy to watch, and the workout looks very pretty and light, but don't be fooled: It is challenging! I love these exercises because you get a total body workout with toning and cardio, but they're low-impact. Your heart rate gets up but you don't feel like you're going to pass out or die, and you can really feel your legs working. Swan Arms will tone and strengthen your shoulders and back muscles so you get graceful posture, and they're the perfect antidote to sitting hunched over at a computer all day. After the cardio section, there are specific mat sections for abs and legs - you can really feel the burn (in a good way). This video is a really great daily workout for all levels - you can easily pop this in and tone your whole body. The extra stretching at the end is a nice touch - after all the hard work, taking the time to stretch your muscles feels really good. I highly recommend this workout!

The footwork was too complicated and I feel I could get a better cardio workout by simply going for a brisk walk. On the positive side, I really liked the ab mat work and do plan to incorporate that into my routine- I think it's more challenging than the ab series in the classic workout. I also liked that there were some new inner thigh moves I can mix into my existing workout. I probably will not use this DVD again but since it was so inexpensive, and I did find some useful material in, I'm not sorry I ordered it. I will however be sticking with the classic workout because it has the bridge series, which is very effective, and also in my opinion a better range of exercises targeted for the lower body.

5856369,5,B00DUGC202,"It took me a month to decide how I felt about this DVD. After trying all the other Ballet Beautiful dvds, I finally got around to doing this one enough times to get a good feel for it.

The allegra intervals are great. I kind of hate running, so the intervals of standing work mixed in with mat work make this doable for me. I know I can make it through the cardio segments because the mat work is not far away.

If you are like me and have 0 dance training, just mirror her movements and ignore the directional commands. You'll get the hang of it if you are patient with yourself.

You have the option of doing the 4 different chapters alone, which I have done, complemented with other Ballet Beautiful dvds in the past. However, to really get the most out of this specific workout, it would be best to do a few chapters in a row. That way you get to do a few cardio intervals, considering that each chapter contains only only cardio interval paired with one mat routine, if I remember correctly. The mat workouts include core, arms, and inner thigh exercises.

I feel like this workout really does lengthen and extend the muscles, reaching areas that are otherwise neglected in a lot of other routines.

The music in this video is more upbeat than others, which is nice. Mary Helen Bowers is pleasant to listen to and fun to try to imitate throughout the workout.

This DVD, unlike the others, has an extensive warm up and cool down, unlike the others. Sometimes I pause in the middle for an extra stretch. All the stretching keeps me feeling long and lean for the rest of the day.",1422835200,2,1583,4.385665529010239

More recently, I've been doing Ballet Beautiful for the last two weeks, and it's really helping me lose some thigh girth that I gained doing one of Jillian Michaels' programs.  I was really excited to get this new workout and do like it and am glad I bought it, but I do prefer her other eight DVDs a bit more.

If you do the entire workout, it comes in at just under 58 minutes long, but you also have the option of dividing it up into shorter workouts.

From the main menu, you have several options:

*  Play All -- 58 minutes long, including the Elongated Stretch segment

*  Standing Cardio:  Legs, Arms, and Core -- about 30 minutes

*  Mat Work:  Abs, Thighs, and Butt -- about 23 minutes long

*  Elongated Stretch -- 7 minutes

*  Audio Options -- gives you the options to play the workout with Mary Helen and music, just with the music, or just with Mary Helen

This is filmed in an all-white room that looks a bit different from her previous backdrops in that you can see large windows and the skyline behind Mary Helen.  I wish they had used the space from the Ballet Baby series since that backdrop and the colorful flowers were so soothing in those four workouts; it was more interesting to look at.  I usually enjoy the basic backdrop in the BB workouts, but in the Mat Work segment, Mary Helen is lying down on an all-white floor against an all-white wall in a white leotard, and the aesthetic of it felt a bit stark and not that soothing to me.

At the very beginning of the workout, Mary Helen gives a few pointers about form and posture, which is a nice reminder.

The Standing Cardio section includes some plie variations at the start, but is mostly standing leg lifts to the front and back and tendu work, all of which include swan arms motions. For each exercise, you'll do two sets of eight repetitions. This got my heart rate up nicely, and wasn't quite as challenging as the cardio segments on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Cardio-Fat-Burn/dp/B00DUGC202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Cardio Fat Burn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Sculpt-Burn-Cardio-Blast/dp/B00FF9SKPI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Sculpt & Burn Cardio Blast</a>. For that reason, this would probably be a good DVD to start with if you need to work up to Cardio Fat Burn or Sculpt & Burn Cardio Blast.  Also, there isn't jumping in the cardio segment; you have one leg on the ground at all times, so it's a more low-impact and quieter workout to do if you're worried about noise or about it being too high impact.

The leg work is the Standing Cardio half is also more straightforward on this workout than it is on Cardio Fact Burn and Sculpt & Burn; since I don't have any ballet training (unless, of course, you count those lessons I took when I was four :-) ), I had a hard time keeping up with the cardio segments on those other two DVDs the first few times I did them, whereas the Standing Cardio segment on this DVD is easier in terms of its choreography and pacing.  Another nice benefit of this Standing Cardio section is that a lot of the moves are done on one leg, so it's an excellent way to work on your balance and on strengthening your core.  This whole section also really works the legs and glutes since you're doing a lot of work where you extend one leg in back of you.

The Mat Work segment opens with about ten minutes of C-curve work, and uses your arms a bit more than the ab work in her previous workouts.  After working abs, Mary Helen moves into outer thigh lifts and small leg circles. There really wasn't much targeted glute work in this section at all (despite the sub-title of this set), which surprised me.  I love her inner and outer thigh and glute work, so really wish that there was more outer thigh work and at least a bit of inner thigh work.  There also wasn't anything that directly targeted the glutes; the outer thigh lifts hit the glutes a bit, but not as much as I was hoping there would be. In my mind, Mary Helen really excels in her mat work for the legs; even though the title of this workout makes it clear that the focus will be on standing cardio, I still wish that there had been more than just ten or so minutes of this workout devoted to leg floorwork.

The Elongated Stretch clocks in at seven minutes long, and it's part of the 58 total minutes of the workout.  This nice, long stretch was a good treat, and is a nice addition to the BB model.  Usually, Mary Helen stretches quite a bit between exercise sets (which is great), but doesn't include a longer stretch like she does here.  On her Ballet Baby workouts, she includes longer stretch segments, which I love, but this was nicer in that the slightly shorter length (only seven minutes, compared to ten or fifteen on her Ballet Baby DVDs) means that I'm less likely to skip the end stretch. I hope that future DVDs include a longer stretch like this.  It's the ""Baby Bear"" perfect length -- not too long, not too short, but rather just right.

While I enjoyed doing this for the first time, I kept feeling a bit disappointed in that the segments didn't feel ""fresh"" to me.  I keep trying to figure out why that is, and think it's because this past week I splurged on a month of Ballet Beautiful's streaming workouts since they were on sale for half price, and have been so happy with the diversity of those shorter segments.  I wish that she had brought some more of that creativity into this new DVD.  The focus on using swan arms throughout each exercise was unique, but many of the exercises themselves didn't feel as fun to do.  I can't quite put my finger on why I'm not liking this one as much as her previous DVDs . . . but that's all I can think of.

For some reason, the sound quality on this is also a bit off; Mary Helen's voice echoes, and it was a bit distracting at first.  Once I got into the workout, I didn't notice it as much, but it's a shame that they didn't catch this during the production.

As a random side note, it seems like Mary Helen might have filmed this before she had her baby since she seems to have more of her pre-pregnancy look.  She always looks amazing, though, but I thought that this was interesting.

As I mentioned at the start of my review, the Ballet Beautiful workouts are fantastic at shaping your muscles into long, lean lines.  Many of the Victoria's Secret Angels train with her, and so does Alexa Chung.  I am an hourglass shape who bulks up really easily in the thighs, and whenever I consistently use my BB DVDs, I slim up and look leaner.  My pants fit more loosely, and my muscles look more defined.  Her workouts are tough, but you will see results when doing them, even if you don't add in much cardio.

Overall, I'm glad I bought this workout and know I'll use it, but I'm not sure that it will get as much use in my repertoire as her other DVDs. I will also update my review when I do this workout again since it may grow on me more when I do it a second time.  If you're new to Ballet Beautiful, I'd suggest starting with her first two DVDs,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B008F283J0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Body-Blast/dp/B009FFHWRU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Body Blast</a>.  I have about 300 workout DVDs in my collection, and those two are some of my most frequently used DVDs since they're so fantastic.

UPDATE ON 3-18-15:  I just did this workout the second time, and liked it more than I did the first time around.  The standing cardio section really targets the legs nicely, while also helping to work on balance.  It's still not one of my favorite BB workouts, but I do like the fact that the cardio is a bit more low-impact.",1422576000,69,8455,4.740943267259056

The DVD is broke into 4 different section that you can play back to back, or individually. Each section has a cardio portion to start with, followed by one of Mary Helen Bower's signature floor exercises.

 I really enjoyed the floor exercises, and was impressed with how they were almost all completely different from the comparable strength exercises in the other two DVD's I had purchased. You will near exhaustion before she queues a break, but the moves are very simple and regardless of your level you can get a great workout.

I found myself not looking forward to the standing up cardio portions of the DVD. I was never really out of breath (which I do workout around 5 days a week, so am in good shape), and the movements were not as easy to follow as the moves she uses during the strength portions of the DVD.

Overall, the DVD was a good purchase, especially for the price. Even if I do not love the cardio portion, the new strength moves made the purchase worth every penny. I would recommend buying this if you already own Ballet Beautiful: Body Blast and Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Workout.",1421107200,8,1290,4.571428571428571

Overall though, I was quite sore, its do-able yet very challenging, and I use it interspersed with my cross fit and running.  Don't expect this to have overnight results though.

I could do the ab work; the thigh work; and the arm work. But the leg work? Forget it. All I did was hurt my knees. Again she explains nothing and moves fast.

5856383,5,B00DUGC202,"I became a fan of BB exercises, and this DVD did not deviate from the general style. If you have tried one of the other BB videos, I don't think you'd like this one either.

Why I like BB in general
My whole life, whenever I tried workout videos - I was disappointed. One either needed a lot of room for jumping around, or I wasn't challenged. I tried BB one cold Winter night when getting dressed to go to the cold gym didn't sound fun. So I figured that I have nothing to lose by doing a video off Prime. 5 minutes into workout my muscles were burning, and I was a weekly exerciser. Since then every video of BB that I've tried I liked.

Why I like this DVD
I would describe this one as an interval training: usual BB workout is mixed with bursts of jumping. While majority of the BB videos are low to impact on your knees, I consider this one to be a medium impact. So for those extra sensitive to knee pain - proceed with caution.
While a lot of moves are the same as in other videos, there are still a couple of new ones. However combination, repetition and flow of the workout is sufficiently different from others, so that I don't find myself bored.
And just like other BB workouts - you need only a mat and a space large enough for your mat!",1409961600,8,1249,4.135802469135802

I ended up just jumping around like an idiot trying to mimic the moves, and wound up with sore feet and ankles. I do like the toning parts. I would do those again, but the actual ballet intervals I think would be too advance for most people who haven't done a few years of ballet training.

I consider this more of a ballet class for beginners then a 'cardio workout' If someone asked her for more ballet then this was her answer. She is SO HAPPY in this one and her body looks less carved more soft, makes me wonder if she is pregnant in this one.

Pros:
It does have a new hard move for arms
Good long stretching segment at the end
No weird crotch shots like in the classic workout.
Darker leotard looks better, easier to see against the white.
One new ab move.

Cons:
Similar abs and inner thigh from classic.
Ballet cardio is confusing but that may be good for muscle confusion.
It's harder then the classic, & body blast.

Classic full Body is for beginners
Body Blast is for Intermediate
This one is for advanced. The Coordination and jumping moves make it harder on your joints.
I give her 3 stars always for not having others working out with her with modified movements.
Modification is essential for beginners who struggle to make progress.
She always forgets to help out us overweight girls who want to keep up and learn but need modified options.
So if you are a beginner or or out of shape, MODIFY
Modify it by not jumping but doing little lifts, modify it by doing 2-3 reps. Or modify by just doing one or two body areas instead of the whole DVD every day. I do like it but it could have been better. I plan on doing this 1 a week for muscle confusion purposes. I have lost about 4 inches doing the classic for a bout a week.

I find myself standing there like ""what the hell do I do???""  I'm beyond disappointed because I was very much looking forward to this DVD.  And I desperately need some cardio in my life.

Also on the old DVDs there was a pleasant intro the each of the workouts.  It would have an intro image of the name of the workout and a brief summary of what it was then followed with her talking about what you were going to do and all and then she proceeded to guide you well through the workout.  This one however did not have any kind of intro.  You literally click on the chapter you want and its her getting started on the workout and not explaining whats happening and your expected to get the workout immediately.

5856430,3,B00DUGC202,"I have the Ballet Beautiful full body workout and body blasts DVDs (which I looove) so I was excited to try cardio fat burn. Although this DVD is marketed as a cardio workout, it also combines periods of toning/strength training. I have to admit, I was a little hesitant because I'm not the most coordinated person and was afraid I won't be able to follow the moves. I tried the DVD out for the first time earlier this week and so far I have mixed feelings about it.

Pros
1. The video is divided into 15 minutes sections (just like the other videos) so it's easy to mix and match different workouts.
2. The cinematography is really nice. Nice and calming atmosphere and I do like that Mary Helen Bowers is the only person in the video.
3. The toning moves are difficult and I believe they are effective. I especially loved the arm portion on the mat, it's different from her moves in the other DVDs. Definitely felt the burn with this one!

Cons
The footwork of the cardio portion is a bit complex for me to follow. I had a hard time going from extending my leg to plie. I felt silly flopping around in my living room. At one point, I just decided to ignore the plie footwork. I was still able to bring my heart rate up but didn't feel like I was in control of my movements.

I don't regret buying this DVD because I still think it contains some really good moves. It's also a good workout to incorporate into my routine to keep my body challenged (so I don't plateau). Perhaps when I become more familiar with the footwork, I will feel more confident and comfortable with the workout.",1386806400,2,1586,4.351351351351352

I found it be very fast paced.  Some of the classic ballet positions are still tricky for me to figure out.  It was good to get the heart rate up, and like all the other B.B. workouts, it's great that you don't need alot of room space to do all the moves.",1386720000,2,455,3.849462365591398

The beautiful classical music and the moves remind me of ballet class in high school, but the workout WORKS so WELL that you WILL hurt immediately if you're out of shape, and probably even if you aren't. I have a particularly hard time working out the muscles between my shoulder blades and this workout along with the others takes care of that without issue. I even went out a bought some ballet shoes, the first I've had since I was 16 years old. :) Long story short, I really really love Ballet Beautiful!

This DVD has many sections that are great, BUT..In the cardio section, it would have been better, if Mary Helen would have given the student a practice run of some of the cardio exercises. If you (the student) are not carefully you can cause discomfort of your knees when you are doing some of the cardio exercises. I consider myself in excellent shape, and I didn't land exactly right on the jumping aspect of the cardio section.causing a small strain. I would recommend that you view the DVD several times first,  so you can see how Mary Helen demonstrates the exact positioning of her knees. This will help prevent the possibility of any mis-alignment of your knees.
If you are new to ballet conditioning, I would recommend her other DVD's firstsuch as ""Ballet Beautiful: Total Body Work-out"" or her book Ballet Beautiful.
Mary Helen is so graceful, sweet and pleasant, just her presence makes you want to succeed. A bit more cueing and practice would have made this DVD achieve a ""5-Star"" rating. I have received great results from her DVD's, and so can you. Just be careful and do those exercises that you can do, and then practice, practice, practice the other exercises to achieve success.

5856439,5,B00DUGC202,"OK I have reviewed the other Ballet Beautiful products but... this one deserves a glowing review as well! As many people have pointed out, Mary Helen Bowers is a tiny little army of a person, and the things this lady make look easy are only truly impressive once you attempt them yourself (my male roommate, who has no problem with his daily chin-ups, push-ups, etc., doing her arm workout had me rolling on the floor laughing - ""Good God, when will it end?!""). BUT that being said, the first time you finally do one of her workouts (or even one segment) all the way through without stopping to die a bit, you will feel like a million bucks - and along the way, you'll start looking like it too! She knows what she's doing, and as a result, you get every last drop of benefit out of the effort and investment you put into her workouts. If you stick with her recommendations and methods to the letter, you will never find yourself thinking, ""Why isn't this working?"" - instead you'll find yourself wondering how on earth just 15 minutes at a time is working so WELL.

Some specific tips/notes about this DVD:
1) Yes, the cardio parts are very dance-based and it may seem complicated or overwhelming if you're a total non-dancer. Be forgiving and patient with yourself and accept that it's going to take time for your body to learn new ways of moving - there's no rush! Also, if you find you're really having difficulty following her movements, think of Mary Helen like a mirror. So don't, for example, lift your left foot when she lifts her left foot; rather, lift your RIGHT foot so that you are mirroring her movements. It's way easier to do it this way (note: obviously if you're doing this, ignore her verbal instructions regarding right and left since they'll all be backwards to you).
2) The cardio is not hardcore but you will get a good huff and puff unless you're a habitual runner or something. Personally, I loathe cardio, so I'm gasping for breath by about the one-minute mark LOL. But that's the nice part (to me): you only have to cardio for about five minutes at a time and then it's back down to the mat for some toning and stretching.
3) In terms of impact on the joints/knees/ankles, I agree with other reviewers that it's not exactly zero-impact. Again, be respectful of your body and what feels right for you... and on that note...
4) DO NOT aim to do everything exactly the way Mary Helen is doing it! She says it a few times throughout the DVD, but her joints and limbs are accustomed to years of ballet - never turn your feet, knees and hips out like she does unless you have a similar dance background. Focus on working the correct muscles that she notes, rather than pointing the toes in a certain manner/angle.

So many of us are probably used to thinking of ""fitness"" as running ourselves into the ground; that's where Ballet Beautiful really stands out in my opinion. There's no berating, no negative focus on what you have to change/improve, no host of peppy little workout bunnies to make you feel inferior - the workouts feel like a one-on-one training session with a really, really fantastic and supportive coach, and the focus is on a more gentle, general improvement of how you feel and look. As Mary Helen herself and her many stunning private clients (including lots of Victoria Secret Angels) demonstrate, the proof is definitely in the pudding here. I only aim for one or two Ballet Beautiful workout segments a day (that's right, just one 96th to one 48th of the day - who doesn't have time for that?), and I honestly see an improvement in every part of me... but especially my mindset about my health and appearance.",1385424000,92,3655,4.561643835616438
5856440,4,B00DUGC202,"The effectiveness of this workout sneaks up on you. I didn't expect to be this sore after a cardio ballet class! For me, the arm and ab work outs are fantastic for creating lean, long muscles.

5856441,5,B00DUGC202,"It's not an overwhelming workout, but it's definitely one you feel. The cardio is working, and just keep your limits in mind when you start, because 20 minutes later, you'll be realizing you probably should've held back a little on your enthusiasm. It's very similar to the Total Body Workout in the series, so the moves will seem familiar, but there's a bit more emphasis on getting your heart rate up with the use of your arms while you tone muscles. I can definitely feel a difference in the body after two weeks, even if I can't see it just yet. You'll get what you put into this one!",1384819200,4,588,4.4036697247706424

This workout is new, fresh, challenging and a really good work out for every little timeframe.",1384300800,,175,4.5
5856443,4,B00DUGC202,"Some background: I've lost inches since I started Mary Helen's Ballet Beautiful workouts- Body Blast and Total Body Workout- about 6 weeks ago. I was a Jillian Michaels fan for about two years until I realised that no matter how much I worked out with her dvds, my body had reached a plateau. Jillian had made me fit, but she had also bulked my thighs and butt, and there was no way she could fix that. Soon after starting the BB dvds, my body shape changed so dramatically, without doing the crazy weights, cardio and high intensity intervals of Jillian's dvds, that I knew I had found the type of exercise my body was supposed to be doing. Mary Helen is so incredible- she makes your whole body look long and lean, like a ballerina's.
Cardio Fat Burn is a great addition to the dvd range, but it definitely does not push you to the extreme in relation to cardio. The title is somewhat deceiving, as I'm sure people will buy it thinking it will give them a killer cardio workout. It doesn't, but it's still an amazing workout. Sections in the workout are similar to the mat work in her other dvds- abs, arms and inner thigh. These sections are, like those in her other dvds, unbelievably challenging. You will be groaning by end of most of the reps as your muscles are completely exhausted. In between this mat work she gets you to do the 'cardio' allegra intervals, which are basically ballet jumps and skips. These are fun, and they do make you sweat, but you don't feel your muscles burning like you do in plyometrics, etc. It's for this reason that I think she really should have added more mat work to target the butt and outer thigh, as these muscles are only moderately worked in the allegra intervals. After this workout, I make sure I also do the bridge series from BB Total Body to work these muscles properly.
The difficultly level of this workout is very high, only because of the mat work. Like I've said in other reviews of her dvds, I have no idea how a beginner could last even five minutes into Mary Helen's workouts. That said, the allegra intervals are perfect for beginners, even though the leg work may take a little while to master (I speak from experience!).  The whole workout is about 1 hour long, and includes a comprehensive warm-up and cool-down, something her previous dvds have sorely lacked (pun intended). I really cannot wait to see what Mary Helen does next.",1384300800,16,2393,4.5265588914549655

5856445,5,B00DUGC202,"This workout is no joke! Mary Helen's Ballet Beautiful really gets my heart rate up! I'd say the heart rate is comparable to a good jog. Perfect for fat loss, toning, and muscle endurance.

It doesn't look hard, but even just keeping your arms moving with her will make your shoulders burn.

As an ex-gymnast, current gymnastics coach, and someone with a little dance experience, this DVD is perfect for me! It would be harder for someone without dance experience, but nothing that cannot be mastered. Like Zumba, the technique will come with practice but the main thing is to keep moving! Be forewarned, though, that this is a high impact workout with a lot of jumping.

I've never felt more like a ballerina!!

I have a few complaints, but even together, I thought this still deserved four stars. My chief complaint is how calf-heavy the workout is. There are different sections, and I realize that ballet is going to have a huge focus on calves, but it still seemed like there could have been a better balance/alternative. Next, I know several people liked the music, but I found it boring and hard to ""feed off of"" like I usually do from a workout DVD. Additionally, I wish the sectioning was more obvious. I opted to play all sections the first time I used this, and it was partway through the third section that I realized I'd already been through the first two. I like that it appeared somewhat continuous, but it would be nice to have some sort of ""And now we're ready to move onto..."" like most DVDs have to help gauge where you are in the workout. Which brings me to the last complaint, which is that it wasn't quite as intense as I'd hoped, considering I'd made it that far before thinking, ""How long is this?"" Not that it's easy, and as with any workout, you get more out of it when you use proper form. I was just expecting another notch up, I suppose.",1516492800,,1256,4.394849785407725
8597870,5,B00DUGC202,"Another wonderful set of workouts from Ballet Beautiful. The DVD begins with a standing warm up exercise followed by intervals of cardio workouts (about 10mins each), interwoven with mat exercises for the abs, inner thigh and arms. It ends with a 15min stretch. The cardio workouts are low impact, fun and it really burns.
For me however, the mat exercises are some of the best! The ab exercise is great for toning that problematic lower ab. I have been doing the exercises in the Total Body Workout and Body Blast DVDs prior to purchasing Cardio Fat Burn and felt the ab exercises in the earlier DVDs weren't intense enough for me. This one, however, was wonderful! It burns and tones the lower abs so beautifully.
The arm exercise is so effective for getting rid of that flab in the triceps. For me, the arm workout in this video is more effective than swam arms in toning the triceps. My bulky tennis playing arms are now sleek, toned and feminine.
I love the inner thigh workout as well. It incorporates variations to the classic inner thigh moves found in the Total Body Workout DVD but is more challenging in that Mary Helen incorporates some ""lift and hold"" types of moves.",1514160000,,1180,4.650717703349282

I got a lot of compliments about how I looked healthier after using this DVD, which I think is a great thing! Downside is that it can get old fast and I felt like certain muscle groups got more attention than others. Music is great, though, compared to a workout DVD's usually high tempo pounding of trendiness. I will say that I would not recommend this as a low impact workout! It is hard on the knees because of so much jumping in place, and if you are sensitive to jolting in your abdomen, then I do not recommend this.
