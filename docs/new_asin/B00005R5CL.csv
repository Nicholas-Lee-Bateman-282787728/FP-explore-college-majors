7951774,5,B00005R5CL,Thanks Mr. Sebak! These programs are so fun to watch. I've been lending these DVDs (I have almost all of Mr. Sebak's documentaries) out to friends and they've all loved them. My dad used to hit every flea market in a 50 mile radius of our house in the 60's and I remember the fun we had hunting treasures. Good memories....,1520812800,,323,4.311475409836065
7951775,5,B00005R5CL,For a used DVD very goog condition. I like PBS documentaries,1517011200,,60,4.545454545454546
7951776,4,B00005R5CL,"My partner and I are huge fans of rummage sales, flea markets and thrift stores so naturally we were entertained by watching other people browse ""treasure and junk"" on the tv. It isn't by any means a see-all-be-all in the style of Ken Burns full of emotion and fire, but Rick Sebak always makes very charming documentaries.",1475366400,,323,4.684210526315789
7951777,5,B00005R5CL,Informative and fun to watch. I live in California now but on the video I saw a dealer that I have purchased many things from at the flea Mart in Seattle so it was very interesting to see I recommend it,1412208000,,202,3.951219512195122
7951778,5,B00005R5CL,PBS is everyman's channel and this series of videos capture things that will change over time and preserves our memories.  It is a must watch.,1402358400,,142,4.68
7951779,4,B00005R5CL,"I bought 3 copies of this. One for my Grandmother, one for myself, and another one for myself when the first one got stolen.

Rick Sebak is usually associated with just Pittsburgh, but this takes a look at flea markets all over the country. I'm a little disappointed in the fact that a lot of the flea markets that were in the documentary are not longer around. I would have loved to travel the country going to each and every one of them.",1390262400,,439,4.289156626506024
7951780,5,B00005R5CL,My son loves going to flea markets and so this was the perfect gift for him.  He loved this documentary.,1389052800,,104,4.2
7951781,4,B00005R5CL,"I actually came to add this video to my Wish List, and am horrified to see no reviews yet!
This documentary is a favorite; my best friend (read: travel accomplice) and I love it.  It is a virtual road trip, scouring the continental US for its most intriguing flea markets, from the miles-long yard sale to the urbane open-air market.  Lighthearted and fun, with unbelievable merchandise (and the people selling and buying aren't so normal either).
Perhaps at times this documentary lulls a bit, especially if by ""documentary"" you hope for an innovation like Trekkies, American Movie, or Crumb.  This, remember, is PBS programming.  But it is fine work indeed; although ""American Culture"" seems like an oxymoron, our nation's history, and especially its quirks, can be found (and bought or sold) under the tents or trees of these special roadside monuments.",1029110400,10,856,5.049645390070922
