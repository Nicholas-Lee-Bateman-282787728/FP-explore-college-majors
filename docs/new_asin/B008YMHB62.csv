My daughter's thoughts: Prodigal Pig is a hilarious movie! I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. My brother and I laughed so hard our sides hurt!

Even though this is a children's movie, it does a good job teaching about forgiving others and learning from your mistakes. Porkchop the guitar-playing pig moves to the big city in hopes of becoming famous, but instead gets swindled by two city rats! Talk about thrilling.

I think children of all ages will love this movie, from the colorful characters to their funny stories at the Silent E Ranch.

Tommy Nelson sent me the above DVD for review purposes. It will allow me to keep the DVD. I have no other connection to and have received no other compensation from Tommy Nelson.",1375315200,,971,4.6608187134502925
8532602,5,B008YMHB62,"Lessons intended for children are sometimes the ones we adults need to hear. There's just something about the simplicity of them that speaks straight to the heart. The story of The Prodigal Pig is one of those lessons. This On the Farm DVD takes the well-known tale of The Prodigal Son, updating it so kids today will understand it.

Porkchop Pig wants fame and fortune in the music business. He's tired of his mundane life of Farmer Bob's Farm. And so, Porkchop takes his life's allowance and heads off into the world, never looking back, or at least not at first. You all know the story...as soon as Porkchop runs out of money he also runs out of friends and fans. The moment he loses everything he realizes just how much he had back On The Farm. It's a lesson for Jenny Dog too, who thinks she needs things like a bigger house or TV. The story is about forgiveness and love, but I also think it's about being thankful for the blessings we already have rather than wishing for the ones we don't.

Featuring the voice talents of Randy Travis, Amy Grant, and Vince Gill, The Prodigal Pig is funny, witty , and a good reminder that we are loved no matter our behavior or circumstance. Besides the Biblical lesson, there are also fun bonus features featuring the letter ""P"". With a focus on literacy, each On the Farm DVD features a different letter of the alphabet with Read Along Storybooks, mini-cartoons, and more. It's perfect for younger children. My oldest is a little past the stage of being interested in the bonus features, but my one-year-old is mesmerized by them. She even started saying the ""p"" sound when we were watching it the other day!
