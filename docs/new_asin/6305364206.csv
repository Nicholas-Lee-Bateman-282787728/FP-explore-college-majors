1015129,2,6305364206,"I would expect nothing less from such a wonderfull cast. However, after watching this long and tedious film, I have learned to never expect anything from this not so wonderfull cast. This movie started very slow,  continued through at a slow pace, and concluded at a slow pace. Follow a  pattern here? The cinematography is well done and the musical score does  help. However I strongly suggest that you stay away from this movie, it is  a big BOMB. (no pun intended)",925430400,2,467,4.658536585365853
1015130,4,6305364206,"In a cross between a John Le Carre Novel, the US/Japanese citizens experience of WWII and the WTC bombing, THE SEIGE was entertaining from start to finish.  Well directed and well acted, it played upon America's  nationalistic pride, its ignorance of Isalm and our distrust of anyone or  anything we don't understand.  Bruce Willis plays a convincing General  Devereaux, which surprised me because I usually only like Willis when he is  the lone ranger type. Denzel Washington's ""Hubbard"" is a great  foil and he puts in his usual stellar performance.  Tony Shalhoub's  portrayal as Hubbard's partner really made the movie.  The lines between  what we understand and what we fear stand out.  I only wish he would have  had even more screen time.  The religious ceremony really cemented his  character's values.  Annette Benning had the most difficult role, but  pulled it off convincingly as a CIA spook who's become so good at  dis-information and twisted truths that she even surprises herself.  The  intimate scenes were tastefully hidden but still got the point across.  The  action scenes were certainly convincing.  Even if you saw the trailer, you  still didn't see the movie.  Just my two cents.",925430400,2,1203,5.046153846153846
1015131,4,6305364206,"First let's admit it that we, Americans, are stereotypical. It's true since we come from different cultural backgrounds, we label cultures this & that, etc. Although disturbing to many mature audiences, The Siege  has its good & bad credentials. At first glance, it is bad in the sense  the movie portrays deviancy, terrorism and violence which was stereotyped  to the Arab World. In the course of the movie, the story tries to tie the  knot between religion and this misconception that nurtures the viewer's  minds that people, regardless of race & ethnicity, are basically the  same. Although strange and mysterious as it seems to be, the Islamic  religion should be respected as shown by actress, Annette Benning who  delivered herself with total reverence and respect to the culture through  acquaintances from her Arab boyfriend, who turns out to be the terrorist at  the end. But what astonishes me is that the movie is NOT ONE-SIDED AT ALL.  Since America will not tolerate terrorism and that America will sacrifice  to protect the citizens against terrorism at all costs, the focus in this  movie shifts to the abuse of power of its leaders. This is where Bruce  Willis, the commanding military general comes in and tortured and executed  an innocent Arab. Riots flared up and he was then arrested by FBI  civilians, headed by Denzel Washington. I only wish that the Denzel's  partner, the Arab FBI agent played by Tony Shaloub read the general's  rights and I think that evens out the controversy. One more comment. Bruce  Willis to me is the only character who sparked some humor in this movie.  Imagine him in full dressed fatigue uniform. Willis, with his heartthrob  good looks, can play other roles but not this one. I think Donald  Sutherland or Jack Nicholson can do the act better. 4 stars for The Siege",925257600,,1820,4.859934853420196

1015364,5,6305364206,"Five years after the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, this film came out ... supposing what would happen if radical Islamic terror became so frequent in New York City that the U.S. government would declare martial law there.  Included in that scenario was the detention of Muslims in New York City ... along the same lines as the detention of persons of Japanese ancestry (including U.S. citizens) during World War II.  Not so strangely, this movie and others along the same lines (ie., 1994's ""True Lies"") drew heavy criticism from the U.S. Muslim community for portraying the religion, as a whole, in a bad light.  This criticism became so forceful as to make Hollywood ""re-think"" such movies.  Example?  The Tom Clancy novel, ""The Sum of All Fears,"" dealt with Islamic terrorists.  But when Hollywood got their hands on it in 2002, the Islamic terrorists were re-cast as Neo-Nazi terrorists for the movie.

""The Siege,"" however (major spoiler alert), had one component that infuriated the Muslim community ... namely the character Samir who, at first, was painted as a peaceful mainstream Muslim - but who later turned out to be the last member of his own domestic terror cell who, in theory, was granting student visas to other Muslims who were entering this country (only to become terrorists themselves).  In short, Samir was the one kind of person that scares a lot of mainstream Muslims and all other persons, regardless of their religion -- a person who feigns the role of a moderate Muslim but, in reality, is a domestic terrorist.

Just a personal historic tidbit.  On S.E. Clinton Street in Portland, Oregon, there's a small mom & pop style grocery store that has been around for many years.  But back during the early years of World War II, it was owned and operated by a Japanese-American family (Mr. Funitake, his wife, and their teenage son).  My mother went to high school with the son.  When the detention of persons with Japanese ancestry took place, government officials rounded up the Funitake family.  Initially, they were scheduled to be detained in an internment facility with others of Japanese ancestry.  But when these officials inspected the store (a store on the bottom floor with their living quarters on the 2nd floor), they found Japanese military documents, shortwave radio equipment, and an extensive collection of shipping manifest data - detailing all shipping into and out of the Port of Portland.  In short, the Funitake family (at least Mr. & Mrs. Funitake) were Japanese spies.

While this doesn't excuse the wholesale internment of persons of Japanese ancestry during World War II, it does point out an equally painful fact ... that sometimes, the government hit ""paydirt.""  And in this film, Samir is an example of that paydirt ... normally innocent-looking people who are in the United States with ""ulterior motives"" detrimental to the health/life of mainstream Americans of all origins/faiths.  On top of that, you have to remember one of Samir's last comments ... that his terror cell was not the ""last"" terror cell.

So, all this leaves people in an ethical quandary.  On one hand, you have the American mindset that tells you internment of people based on ethnic origins and/or religion is wrong.  But on the other hand, you have to ask yourselves how many lives have been spared by ""finding"" this paydirt.  Which is the ""greater good?""  Surely, the Funitake family wasn't alone - that there were other Japanese spies on U.S. soil during WWII.  And just as surely, peaceful appearances among our nation's Muslims can be deceiving - at least sometimes.  It's a tough nut to crack and, hopefully, our nation will figure out ""how"" to crack it without too much collateral damage.

Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, and Bruce Willis played their roles in a spectacular manner.  But kudos goes out to Sami Bouajila (Samir) for his portrayal of the person ""believed"" to be peaceful who turned out to be a domestic terrorist.  And special kudos go out to Tony Shalhoub who played Denzel Washington's FBI partner (of Middle-Eastern descent) ... whose own son becomes a victim of the detention.  This would be a tough topic for any movie to handle in today's world ... but it was handled well in this pre-911 film.",1488672000,,4261,4.918881118881119

1015449,5,6305364206,"The Siege Against Terrorism
 In America, there is a huge problem with middle eastern extremists following their ideals to end other religions. Not all Muslims believe that they must sacrifice their lives for Ala, their all mighty god.  Though there are many extremists that will sacrifice their life for Ala. The movie The Siege was a great example of how the United States handled the act of terrorism. It demonstrated how Americans aren't as safe as they once thought. Although the movie was released in 1998, it was almost a mirror image to the attack on 9/11 in New York City. The main difference is the movie was based out of Brooklyn, New York. The Siege is a great movie, it was way before its time because of the controversial plot line, and the characters.
 The film showed the controversial what if element, The element that many people didn't completely understand before the 9/11 attack. The Siege helped open the door of understanding our security realism. The movie showed fictional ideas that became real over time. People always thought that a large scale terrorist attack on the United States was absurd. It was never the average Muslim citizens that were looked at as a threat, the way they were in the movie; it was the extremists, and the religion they belong to.  Many middle eastern people, who are now US citizens thought it was an outrage that their former way of life was portrayed as a threat. (Waxmen) Just about three years, terrorism became a real thing in the United States. The world stopped moving. In the movie the writer did such a great job with building the traumatic events of escalating violence. This made for a comfortable transition between scenes. This movie definitely seemed written before its time. The terrorists believed it was destiny to end other religions, so theirs could take power.
With the strong controversial plot, it took a very talented cast to give the perception. The cast selected for this movie was excellent. Thanks in part of Denzel Washington, who helped to create a strong FBI presence throughout the film. He played as FBI Agent, Anthony Hubbard, a man who fights for the US constitution when others are hungry for control. He believed in upholding the law, not making the law of his own. The director of the film structured the characters, to both use each other to find the unknown about the terrorists, but also keep secrets from each other to cover up the truth. Annette Bening played as Elise Kraft, a CIA terrorist professional with her own links to the middle east. Her character was definitely needed in the film, to keep the audience wandering what don't we know? An example of this is Kraft having two different names. It helps give the perception that actual CIA Agents withhold information from other agencies. Information that could benefit the general public of the United States. Bruce Willis played the General, a man who is so power hungry, that he takes Martial Law as a new dictatorship. It seemed at the beginning that he was warning the politicians not to bring the Army into the city, knowing that they eventually would.
 The Siege was a movie that I would personally recommend to any person that enjoys to look at the side of the unknown. This is an action, thriller type of movie with many twist and turns. It will keep an audience on their toes throughout the movie. People in the United States have changed over the decade since. This film helped people to understand that the country is a safe place, but not invincible as they once thought. The Siege is definitely the movie to see because its ironic fore-seeing of the future. The controversial plot line, and the characters make the difference known.",1475107200,,3697,4.779342723004695

1015537,3,6305364206,"[spoiler alert] Yes, this film was prescient about the debates that would follow in the wake of 9/11 and the hysteria and Islamophobia that would infect our nation, but then, those debates already had clear lines drawn before 9/11, it's just that the actual attack on the Twin Towers mobilized both sides, and brought the freaks out to terrorize and brutalize random brown people. The fact is, in spite of its earnestness, it's just not a very well made film.  Benning seems to me like she wandered on from another film shoot: maybe in 1998 this was a convincing portrait of a morally conflicted deep undercover middle east CIA operative, but after Homeland, this sort of thing looks weak: Benning looks and acts like  she's in a 40s film noire not a 90s political thriller and the climactic scene where she is used as a human shield--Zwick makes sure he hits all the relevant memes--is just badly acted and choreographed. For instance,  Benning acts as if she is shot at least a beat later than she should, making her fall unintentionally comical instead of dramatic. And Denzel Washington probably took this part so he could do the rousing defense of the constitution speech.  As Benning realizes finally what Washington twigged in the first reel and which even the audience can't help being unsurprised by in the last, she says: ""how could I have missed the play?""  To which one is tempted to reply (this is, after all, New York): ""I don't know, traffic?"" Zwick can be an affecting filmmaker when the drama outweighs his didacticism, but such is not the case here.  It's still worth watching though for Tony Shaloub's quips, Washington's always stupendous credibility, and the fact that you can match many of the film's scenes to future historical reference points in our post 9/11 America.",1471996800,2,1793,4.824104234527687

1015676,5,6305364206,"This has become 5 stars over the last 18 years as the questions it raised became real.  The most surreal part---the occupation, within the United States, of neighborhoods with high concentrations of Moslems---is now very similar to the policies advocated by two 2016 Presidential candidates.

When the movie first came out, some Arab civil rights groups attacked it as stereotyping Arabs and Moslems as terrorists.  That was a serious misinterpretation of the movie, which is about fear and paranoia in a free society.  There are terrorists who are bad guys, but even these are written as complex characters rather than comic book villains.  It also has Tony Shalhoub in a rare dramatic role as an ethnic Arab FBI agent who shows heroism, disgust with terrorists, pride in his family, and ultimately anguish and anger over the detention of his 13-year-old son.

We have not gone as far as the actions in this film, but despite this, the film is more optimistic than one that might be written today.  There are some moments that are oddly charming as they reflect our pre-Sept 11th innocence.  In the end, both FBI agents and the general public rise up against the un-American fear, anger, and authoritarianism.  At this point in our history, we do not yet know if the American people will be as freedom-loving and compassionate as we are idealized in this picture.",1458864000,7,1364,4.895652173913043

1015817,4,6305364206,"Released in 1998, ""The Siege"" chronicles events as New York City becomes the target of escalating terrorist attacks after the abduction of an Islamic leader by the US military. The head of the FBI's Counter-Terrorism Task Force (Denzel Washington) teams up with a CIA operative (Annette Benning) to hunt down the terrorist cells responsible for the attacks. Ultimately, the US government declares martial law and sends in the troops, led by General Devereaux (Bruce Willis). Tony Shalhoub plays the FBI agents Arab-American partner while Sami Bouajila plays a seemingly suspicious Arab-American.

While clueless PC morons have criticized this movie as ""racist propaganda"" it dared to show the awful truth in the late 90s and was nigh prophetic in light of 9/11 occurring less than three years later. There are numerous noble Arab-Americans, and the movie emphasizes this,  but  lets be honest  there are also Islamic whack-jobs in our midst who enjoy blowing themselves up with as many innocents as possible so they can go home to Allah and 72 virgins (or whatever).

I like the fact that General Devereaux (Willis) isn't a black or white character and viewers can have completely different views about whether or not hes actually a villain. The movie shows that hes a professional soldier who warns the governmental leaders exactly what would happen under martial Law, a suspension of all civilian rights guaranteed under the constitution, clearly cautioning them that they might not like the form of medicine martial law dishes out. But its a desperate situation and they give him the go-ahead, so he offers up exactly what he said he would give. He has his methods to protect his country and performs them with conviction. The terrorists were killing masses of innocents and hes commissioned to stop it, which is what he does, PC or not. Does this make him evil? These are questions the movie provokes and youll have to answer them for yourself.

This is a quality movie that frankly addresses relevant topics and tries to be fair and balanced, but it sorta shoots itself in the foot at the end. Read the spoiler commentary below for details.

The film runs 116 minutes and was shot in New York City with a couple scenes in California.

GRADE: B-

***SPOILER ALERT*** DONT READ FURTHER IF YOU HAVENT SEEN THE FILM

One of the main points of the movie is that it's wrong to mistreat Muslim-Americans by profiling them, rounding them up and subjecting them to investigation outside normal procedures because it's equivalent to the internment of Japanese Americans during WW2. There are two problems with this: (1.) It isn't the same issue. Interning the Japanese was wrong because the government was rounding them up based on their ETHNIC HERITAGE. The Feds would've interned German-Americans if they used the same logic. The issue with Muslim terrorism isn't ethnicity, but rather religion. Statistically, most terrorists against the US are Muslims of Middle Eastern descent. Therefore ""profiling"" them is simply acting in accord with statistics. That's just cold hard logic, not racism. By contrast, interning Japanese-Americans during WW2 wasn't logical.

(2.) More importantly, the movie undermines itself by having Samir turn out to be a radical suicide bomber. This revelation demonstrates that peaceful Muslims can't be trusted, just as the Army and their supporters believed (in the movie). There's no reason to assume that any of the rank-and-file Muslims depicted couldn't have turned out to be terrorists just like Samir. This being the case, the army was right to intern and interrogate them. As you can see, the movie takes a noble position and then inexplicably contradicts it.",1445990400,,3692,5.106135986733002

1016059,1,6305364206,"The entire movie was a ploy to be empathetic to Isalm and make Aerica look like the terrorists. Denzel Washington should be ashamed of even taking this role. He caused most of the terrorist activity to succeed because he failed to act. He believed you could reason with terrorists. Two examples will suffice: (1) The CIA woman said shoot the terrorists on the bus, he says he will talk them down, and they blow up the bus. (2) The CIA woman at the end of the movie says shoot him, shoot him, and Denzel Washington just keeps on running his mouth thinking he can talk the terrorist out of it. The terrorist shoots the CIA woman. She would not have been shot if Denzel Washington had done what she said.

You cannot reason with religious fanaticism; you have to stamp it out. They do not care about rational thinking. They have been mentally twisted, i.e., brainwashed for their entire life, and you think a five minute conversation is going to undo that? Really? If, or should I say when radical Islam comes to America in a big way, please may they start with Hollywood and the liberal media, who have been paving the way for them to get here. These liberal minded people will be the death of us all. A pacifist and a ruthless bully meet on the street, you either take the bully out with a punch to the throat, kick to the groin or a stomp into his knee.

1016068,5,6305364206,"After seeing this movie again for about the 20th time, I finally decided to write a review. This movie is in my top 20 list of post-apocalyptic films (because I've also planned for a solar generator post-apocalypse :-). I love good suspense/mystery-thrillers if the plot is intelligent and the actors are great. I'd say this movie fits strongly in that last category.

Since this movie was released almost 20 years ago, the other reason I'm writing the review is that hopefully, it catches the attention of people aged mid-teens to 30, who may have missed it first run. Those individuals who didn't even hit 18 before they had to contemplate a terrorist attack from a different culture, country - and in three places (counting the field in PA and Washington, DC) - have grown up in a country where they have had terrorism hung over their heads like Damocles' sword.

This movie addresses that exact issue, presents a comparable scenario to 9/11, and shows the danger of isolating one group of people, profiling, waiving constitutional rights in the name of ""keeping the US safe""...and how it falls to a few people to save us from degenerating into a police (military) state.

Sadly, much of what the movie warned about has come to pass. In fact, only one thing hasn't yet- martial law; in its replacement, we have constitutional rights broken with being monitored ala 1984. The monitoring, however, extends to *every* citizen, while profiling continuous to be limited to citizens of Middle Eastern origin.

The ongoing problems with the Middle East and the multiple US concerns about involvement, terrorism and security measures that have occurred in the 17 years after the release show this film's almost eerie prescience. The major actors in this film - Denzel Washington, Annette Benning, Tony Shalhoub, and Bruce Willis - are perfect in their roles.",1404259200,6,1853,4.967741935483871

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Looming-Tower-Al-Qaeda-and-the-Road-to-9-11/dp/1400030846/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11</a>

Which is why the fact Wright is one of the writers responsible for the ""story"" in ""the Siege"" is a total puzzlement to me.  That's because that movie displays none of the insight that ""the Looming Tower"" did.  Instead, I would argue that the movie presents a view of the confrontation between the United States and Islamic terrorists that Noam Chomsky might put forth.

The premise of the film is good enough.  New York is under ""siege"" by cells of terrorists who display appalling ruthlessness in a series of horrendous attacks.  Denzel Washington plays ""Hub,"" a street savvy FBI agent trying to stop the attacks and bring the terrorists to justice.  But in a classic display of blaming victims instead of perpetrators, the movie quickly shows how all the killing and destruction is ultimately the United States' fault.

<spoilers>

1.  The terrorists were individuals that the US supported at one point before ""callously"" abandoning them.

2.  The terrorists were allowed to come into the United States by Annette Benning's character, a CIA agent who has to be the most stupid and unrealistic depiction of such I have ever seen in cinema.

3.  The terrorists were ""provoked"" by the US apprehension of their sheikh which was undertaken by an ""evil"" American general played by Bruce Willis.

<end spoilers>

Then there are the myriad of things that happen in this film that are patently absurd:

1.  The United States (under the leadership of President Clinton who is shown in a brief bit of news video) decides to put New York City under martial law with Bruce Willis's deranged general in overall command.  Come on!  If ever the President decided to proclaim martial law in New York City, I guarantee he wouldn't have put a two star general in charge.  I would think that something like that would be supervised at the very highest level of political leadership (if not Clinton himself then Gore and Janet Reno would have been up there).

2.  The general then decides to intern all Muslim males of a certain age.  Again, can anyone really imagine that happening in the modern era?  And if it was going to be done, can you really believe that it would be a decision implemented by one general officer?

3.  We also get to see Annette Benning's character do things that would probably get her institutionalized in real life...like conducting her own little kidnapping operation on the streets of New York (CIA's ability to operate in the US is severely constrained by law).  Then there's the fact that she sleeps with one of her informants and smokes a joint with him (ever hear of mandatory drug testing in the CIA?) and she does it while knowing she's under electronic surveillance by the FBI.

<spoilers>

The worst part of the movie is it's resolution.  The movie reveals to us that the real enemy of American democracy is the US military as embodied by Bruce Willis.  I served in the US military, and I can tell you straight that the US military would absolutely dread enforcing martial law in the US and would be extraordinarily risk averse (I bet there would be hundreds of JAG officers (i.e. lawyers in uniform) in such an operation subjecting each and every action by soldiers to intense oversight and scrutiny).

<end spoilers>

So to sum up, ""the Siege"" is truly bad, and it's an insult to all the American servicemen and members of the Intelligence Community who have been fighting terrorism in its various shapes and guises over the last three decades.  Are the men and women in the military or CIA and FBI perfect?  No.  Do they sometimes make mistakes?  Yes.

Bad: Uh... Bonus features, where are you?

One in November, I was feeling the need to re-watch this movie again. The reason I bought it on Blu-Ray was because I could not stream it on Netflix. However, when I looked, there were reviews, some were consistent with what I thought about it when I first watched it, others accused it of being racist. I did not remember it being racist, which intrigued me, and as I had bought a new laptop with a Blu-ray player, the choice seemed obvious.

The movie was better than I remembered it. It is a maze of deception and betrayal, with FBI Special Agent Anthony 'Hub' Hubbard (played by Denzel Washington) trying to root out the terrorist threat. Every character who is integral to the plot has some deep pathos, from Annette Benning's many-faced CIA agent to Agent Frank Hadad, Hubbard's Muslim-American partner, to the two villains of the story. The problem is, to respond to the accusations of racism, I would have to spoil this movie's ending, and in the end something as ""definite"" as racism is actually extremely hard to define. Just remember what my room mate (who watched the movie with me) said: ""Just because there's racist people in it doesn't make it racist.""

While I have no problems with the movie itself, one of the major selling points of Blu-Ray bonus features. I don't think there are any on this disk, except some previews. While the Broken Arrow trailer nearly made up for it (John Travolta hamming it up always brings a smile to my face) I would have loved some commentary or a behind the scenes video. With the prevalance of up-sampling technology in today's devices, you have to ask yourself, ""Is it worth the extra money to get the Blu-Ray?""",1355875200,,1762,4.6957928802588995

1016394,4,6305364206,"Overall, movie scripts have gotten more sophisticated over the decades and this is a good example.

Here's the scoop. This cautionary tale involves Mideastern terrorist cells that are starting to set off bombs in NYC. Denzel Washington plays an FBI department head trying to find these cells with the help of and NSC agent, Annette Bening, who is also trying to track the cells through one of her contacts. Things get out of hand to the point Marshall Law is declared and military troops are deployed to round up anyone fitting a broad profile and thwart the wrongdoings.

Watching the FBI procedures, along with Bening's working her contact, is very engrossing. These are smart people trying to come to grips with an entirely new set of rules. Rules they've not played by before. You see and feel the urgency. Agents on the phone and in labs and whatnot trying to put together threads of evidence. They are doing a good job. They make arrests and kill bad guys, but the bad guys are always a step ahead. This is some very smart writing. Where things begin to stumble is in the third act when Marshall Law is declared. It then shifts into preaching. Will we give up our Constitutional rights for safety? It gets very iconic with scenes showing crowds of all races and religions protesting the military lined streets. Denzel putting Bruce Willis (a military General) under arrest in the final scene, in the name of the constitution, is just a bit too much.

That aside, this is still a very good movie. Zwick does a sweet job in directing. It's a very slick movie. No rough edges here. All levels of production are very professional. If political thrillers are your poison, this should be very satisfying.",1327017600,,1704,4.7114093959731544

1016399,5,6305364206,"Really like this movie, especially with the presence of Washington, Shalhoub and Willis in it. Really a good all around depiction of what might happen in a huge metropolitan city if a string of terrorist attacks took place in a short period. While showing that racial profiling would be the most common sense way to find the terrorists, it also illustrates the facts that blindly herding a whole race into a statium is not the way to stop terrorists. Also good at showing the extremes on either side; islamo fascism as the reality faced in the real world, they are muslims, they take is seriously, and to them, they are VERY MUCH following the teaching of the koran. And the opposite extreme; that as great as the U.S. Military is, and there would be no country and no freedom without them, unleashing an Army Division with tanks and helicopters and thousands of armed soldiers in an American city is NOT the way to go. Unleash thousands more FBI agents from other cities, NOT a Light Infantry Division.

The only negatives I'd have about this movie is the very close to frontal male nudity between the last terrorist and the CIA agent, taking it right to the edge. Not necessary. And of course the language is horrible in several places, but hollywood couldn't make a movie without the F word every five minutes if their lives depeneded on it. That's just hollywood, cause of course it's not artistic or interesting or entertaining if it's not as vulger as you can get several times. Except that we'd watch it more often if not for the language and little ears in our home.

Side note, Anthony Shalhoub REALLY makes this movie. Considering of course the normal greatness of Washinton, Shalhoub is really brilliant, so versitile, as shown in his character of Monk and his character in MIB II, Galaxy Quest and other movies, this movie shows what a great dramatic actor he is also, and he's perfect at illustrating that not all muslims are the enemy, OR are terrorists.

A man is arrested and interrogated by the police. Another man is followed into Brooklyn. He runs, they pursue; the man escapes into a red van without plates.

The worst terrorist bombing since Oklahoma City. They will ""turn the heat up"" to get results and learn what is going on. One prisoner is interrogated. ""Tell me about the money.""

[The ""Mata Hari"" technique?] A General is sent to New York city to talk to FBI Agent Hubbard. They find three terrorists in an apartment, but none will talk.

A celebration is ended by another bombing at a theatre. Cultural leaders are victims. Later a backfire scares people. Other cities have dealt with terrorists. Then cell phones start beeping. It's a school! Agent Hubbard takes action. Leaders in Washington discuss a response. A van loaded with explosives crashes into a Federal building! Will bringing in the military to Brooklyn cure the problem? Martial law is declared! Can they find 20 people in a city of two million? An error in judgment? Do they use an old technique with Samir? They get a name. FBI agents get their man. But the Army attacks the same building. Hundreds of suspects are arrested and concentrated in a stadium. [No probable cause!] Will they use torture to get answers from someone who doesn't know the answer? The sheik was an ally against Saddam, then they were dropped. This caused them to turn against America, who taught them how to make bombs for terrorism. [Wasn't this based on real events?]

Hubbard says Samir has made contact with the last cell. Will the Army interfere? People gather to protest the military occupation. Will Sharon be surprised? ""Belief is power, not money."" There is a confrontation to provide a dramatic ending. ""Inshallah."" There is another confrontation between General Deveraux and Agent Hubbard. ""Give them the order!""

In 2005 some people advocated sending the military to New Orleans, but could never say what problems would be cured by this.

1016490,5,6305364206,"A good movie then in 1998, prescient in an unsettling and unnerving way today, in 2009.

Bruce Willis is very effective as the army general sent in to ferret out the terrorists, to use any and all means necessary, inside the city of New York, and who have already struck multiple times in the city, which is placed under martial law, even as the FBI agents, led by Denzel Washington and Tony Shalhoub, try to use legal and civilian means to gather the intelligence.

The movie is commendable in its attempt to strike a balance and not paint all Arabs and people of middle-eastern descent with the same brush of terrorism. It also tries to portray the two sides of the debate with some thought: on the one hand you have the people who believe that you need to fight terror with any and all means necesary, including torture, while on the other hand you have those who believe torture is not justified. In the middle you have the terrorists, fed on a lethal diet of propaganda and ideology, and you don't have any easy answers.

Bruce Willis as the person who believes in only two shades, black and white, who believes any and all means necessary are justified, including torture, could be  prototypical for any number of important people in power today and in the recent past. The implacable nature of the terrorists in the movie is echoed, almost ad-verbatim, by real world terrorists today, where inequities, real and perceived, can be avenged only through terror inflicted on any enemy targets, military as well as civilian.

The similarities with the present day fight against terror seem eerily similar, and this is what makes this movie much more real and effective today than it was in 1998. Anything that seemed far-fetched about the movie in 1998 was no longer so after Sep 11, 2001.

1998 the world seemed a safer place, where 9/11 had not happened, where civilian planes had not been turned into lethal missiles to be used against civilians, where Gitmo did not exist in the popular psyche except as a reference in the movie, ""A Few Good Men"", Abu Ghraib was something that only the 'other' guys did, and the phrase ""with us or against us"" used only in the wild wild west movies or as a mocking exaggeration.",1244160000,,2218,4.645408163265306

Strangely enough, ""The Siege"" was made several years prior to this darkest day in American history as though it was predicting or foretelling what would one day happen.  I hope the terrorists didn't get their ideas after watching this action adventure.

  ""The Siege"" has a stellar cast of mega talent that includes Denzel Washington (""Fallen""), Bruce Willis (""The Sixth Sense"") and Annette Bening (""In Dreams"").  I normally review horror movies but this is one of the most horrifying movies I've seen in a long time, because it all seemed so real and plausible.  The great acting made it that way.  Annette Bening was the real surprise.  I knew she could act, but I didn't realize how well.  I have grown use to seeing Washington and Willis in tough-guy roles but not Bening.  She played a great CIA agent who was literally sleeping with the enemy.  Washington was a great FBI agent who was genuinely trying to serve and protect his county - the good guy.  Willis was an evil, corrupt colonel - a jerk you loved to hate, i.e., the bad guy.

  Watching the terrified hostages through the windows of the bus made me want to scream.  I felt helpless.  Watching people hang from windows of the Twin Towers as they burned made me feel helpless.  ""The Siege"" was almost too real.  It made me want to cry.

  The plot for ""The Siege"" was excellent.  It was non-stop action with several twists, especially at the end.  It told a good moral.  We are all Americans no matter what we look like and should be treated with dignity and justice.  I recommend this pot boiler to anyone who enjoys good action adventure movies.  Be forewarned, there are numerous scenes of grisly, realistic violence.",1208649600,,1888,4.636363636363637
1016564,4,6305364206,"'The Siege' takes place in a pre-September 11 New York.  Islamic terrorists have stirred the interests of the FBI and the CIA.  The stakes are raised when Arabs seize a bus and threaten to blow it up.  Anthony 'Hub' Hubbard (Denzel Washington), a crack FBI agent/negotiator, goes against the advice of CIA agent Elise Kraft (Annette Bening) and tries to negotiate the surrender of the terrorists.  Kraft points out that the terrorists are not interested in negotiating, but in publicity.

Eerily prescient, the movie starts veering to implausability when a military crackdown on terrorists actually occurs in the United States, unlike what actually happened when more that a few Americans are killed by Islamic terrorists on that fateful day.

The Siege is a tense thriller, well-acted, and probably seemed far-fetched when it hit the theaters in 1998.  Sadly, the events in the movie foretold a bleak reality just three years later.

In the movie, terrorist bombing after bombing occurs.  Fortunately, we have (so far) be spared this sequential terrorism.

1016568,5,6305364206,"The Siege tells a hypothetical story about terrorist attacks on New York City by Islamic fundamentalists, and how an FBI department led by Special Agent Hubbard (Denzel Washington) tries to stop them. A CIA agent (Annette Bening) is also involved, and refuses to cooperate with the FBI, at least at first. When the attacks continue and the FBI and police are unable to stop them, President Bill Clinton imposes martial law and U.S. Army units under General Devereaux (Bruce Willis) occupy and isolate Brooklyn and round up all the young Arab men and place them in an internment camp. This leads to several consequences and to a final showdown that will not be revealed here.

The Siege was controversial already in 1998 when it was released: the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee and the Council on American-Islamic Relations both protested strenuously and said the movie was offensive and discriminatory. After the 9/11-2001 terrorist attacks on the United States it can be seen that the movie was in some ways prescient: it practically predicted terrorist attacks on New York by Islamic fundamentalists, a fatal lack of cooperation between the FBI and the CIA, and the imposition of measures that reduced civil liberties for average Americans.

In fact, the key conflict in The Siege is not the conflict between the terrorists and the law enforcement agencies. The key conflict is an ideological one: On one hand there are those who believe that all possible means, including the use of torture and the detention and isolation of suspects with no access to legal process, can be necessary responses to a terrorist threat. On the other hand there are those who believe that use of torture and the reduction of civil liberties can never be justified, and that if one resorts to these measures then one has handed victory to the terrorists.

It is the emphasis of this ideological conflict that makes The Siege so thought provoking and leads me to award it five stars.

Others have panned The Siege as being too anti-military, claiming that the imposition of martial law is farfetched and the U.S. military depicted as too inhumane. Here it must be pointed out that in the hypothetical situation presented in The Siege there was an on-going series of terrorist attacks with no end in sight, a far different situation than that experienced on 9/11-2001.

It's interesting to note that the script for The Siege was written by Lawrence Wright, who later, in 2006, wrote a book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Looming-Tower-Al-Qaeda-and-the-Road-to-9-11/dp/037541486X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11</a>, and won the Pulitzer Prize for it. This book is also highly recommended.

A few words about DVD extra material. The first DVD release (2000) includes a 13-minute special feature ""The Making of The Siege"", which is fairly interesting but nothing very special. There is a newer DVD release (2007) subtitled ""Martial Law Edition"" which includes two additional special features, ""The Siege: Taking New York"" and ""The Siege: Freedom is History"". Unfortunately I haven't seen this edition yet.

Highly recommended, at least if you want more than just action and drama and enjoy thought-provoking stories.

i think what got me the most was how the terrorists didn't care about their lives, just as they don't over in Iraq. as long as the message is clear and the word got out, they will continue doing what they are doing until the message is listened to. in the movie, it was amazing to see Hollywood's depiction of the chaos that would ensue after such an act. especially since this was before a real incident that happened just about the same way.

1016571,4,6305364206,"Watching the 1998 THE SIEGE in 2007 and then rolling through all the reviews of this film from the time of release to the present is a lesson in the power of the cinema.  The obvious initial response was less about the film as a film than about the manner in which the FBI, CIA, Military, Terrorists, and public responded to the unimaginable: shouts of protests about 'glorification of occult terrorists', the Hollywood idea of the impossible happening, and the criticism of the fine cast of actors who steeped into roles 'beyond swallowing' are all here in these reviews.

Now, six years after 9/11 reviewers are taking a different view, though most still find the film pompous and obnoxious.  Offensive versus defensive. And after viewing the movie as a movie it is gratifying to know that people feel strongly and are vocal about the depiction of the 'war against terrorism' we continue to lose.  Movies that make people think and talk are valuable, and in that light the film is more successful than initially considered.

Yes, there are gaping holes in the script and the plot and the concept, but as a little thriller it maintains our attention throughout and offers some fine moments from actors such as Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Tony Shalhoub, Bruce Willis, Sami Bouajila, Ahmed Ben Larby, Aasif Mandvi among others. And then there are the panoramas of New York City under siege with the Twin Towers standing mightily in the cityscape...  It begs the question: if scriptwriter Lawrence Wright and director Edward Zwick (Blood Diamond, The Last Samurai, Courage Under Fire, Glory, Leaving Normal, Legends of the Fall, etc) were thinking along these lines and finding flaws in our intelligence forces, why weren't the leaders in Washington, DC in tune with 'absurd possibilities'?  It makes one think - and that is the best thing about this film.  Grady Harp, January 07",1169510400,8,1885,4.943037974683544
1016572,3,6305364206,"The Siege is basically a ""terrorists come to Brooklyn"" movie.  It stars Denzel Washington as leader of a FBI team investigating terrorist cells in NYC, Annette Bening as a sly and shifty CIA agent. Bruce Willis as the two-star Army general who brings his troops to town, and Tony Shalhoub as Washington's Arab-American partner (nice job, Tony).

So what happens WHEN things start blowing up?  The FBI works flat out in stopping the bad guys.  There are jurisdictional issues with other agencies.  Shadowy folk remain shadowy.  There are power plays.  People want the ear of the president.  And there are victims, heros, and villains.  This movie has them all.

The plot had a convincing build-up, but the conclusion was a bit anti-climatic.  The final cell was a bit too Hollywood, with everybody showing up at just the right time... and in the unoccupied public baths?

However, this movie is worth viewing for those first 80 minutes.",1167350400,4,935,4.923076923076923

I am not used to see Bruce Willis as a bad guy, especially as an Army General, but he did a great performance and he still showing that he can do almost any roll in any movie. The only bad thing in this DVD is that is does not have special features in it.",1163030400,4,642,3.9767441860465116
1016614,2,6305364206,"You can tell this movie was released in 1998 because you can still see New York's Twin Towers standing, and because of the groveling incantations of ""Islam is a religion of peace,"" repeated often enough (along with casting a Good Guy Arab Cop, Tony Shalhoub) to offset any PC-incorrect image of portraying Islamofascist terrorism.

A measure of how silly this movie appears from the rearview mirror of 2006 and all the ghastly Islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 is the first terrorist scene in the movie, where Denzel Washington as FBI agent tries, via megaphone, to talk the terrorists down from a hostage situation. He succeeds in getting the terrorists to let children exit the bus. Jihadis with a conscience -- now where have we ever seen this actually happen - Beslan (186 children killed)? London? Madrid? Mumbai? Only as old people start to exit the bus on a second appeal by Denzel does the bus blow up.

After a series of bombings in New York's supermarkets, movie theaters, restaurants, etc., pressure builds to call in the U.S. Army under martial law. Bruce Willis, the Army commander who is to take on this task, warns time and again that this isn't the proper role of the Army, but then, as one of the President's advisors explains in the movie, as if this is just one of those political things, the ""President wants to appear presidential."" Remember, this is 1998, and though critics of the movie, such as the New Yorker, refer to Willis's character as a ""fascist U.S. Army general"", the decision to grant him martial law authority would have been, ahem, none other than Bill Clinton. The movie slides by that little detail, however, to make it look like Willis, all on his own, is rounding up all able-bodied men of the Muslim persuasion (less draconian, by the way, than the rounding up of all Japanese-Americans on the West Coast by FDR, where the threat was less real and imminent than in this movie, but let's not talk about that, either; we're still in 1998, after all).

Of course, the CIA comes in for its usual whipping by Hollywood, where CIA agent Annette Bening has kept crucial facts to herself because she has personal scores to settle -- you see, she is the one who trained and armed some of these terrorists who are now running amok. Oh, yeah, sure, women-hating Al-Qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty Annette to train them!

But the best nonsense comes at the end: Denzel Washington and a handful of FBI agents rush into Army combat HQ and somehow surround Bruce Willis and pull their guns, saying he is under arrest for ""violating the Constitution"" (hey, why aren't they arresting the guy who ordered the martial law, Bill Clinton?). The general's clueless security detail also draws its guns, and there's a Mexican standoff. Denzel, using the same powers of persuasion that freed at least the kiddies from Islamofascist murder on the bus, appears to be succeeding in talking the Army soldiers out of using their guns to protect Willis. So Willis accepts the situation, allows himself to be arrested, and as the credits roll we see all these Army vehicles leaving Brooklyn in shame -- all it took was to bust the ""fascist"" general. Ta-dah!

So the movie, with a heap of literary license, proves at least one point at the end: back in the 1990s, it didn't take much for Bill Clinton to wuss out and avoid taking on the terrorists.

Meanwhile, some day, sooner or later, the idea of pre-emptive internment of Jihad-age Muslim men as a defensive measure will indeed catch on, if not here, then perhaps in France, the Netherlands, Russia, Israel -- it will be interesting to see who goes first. Because it is not just the Newtonian laws of physics that decree that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. When they do the sequel to this preposterous movie in New York sans the World Trade Center, Willis will play the part of the hero, and whoever gets stuck with the FBI agent role will be the fool.

I give the movie two stars instead of one, because I would hate to discourage the making of such a sequel, and two, because any movie with Annette Bening in it automatically gets an extra star in my book.",1157155200,9,4162,4.685362517099863
1016615,4,6305364206,"This movie has become even more relevant since it came out in 1998.  It was controversial and there were very predictable cries of ethnic defamation and so forth.  While it came out after the first bombing of the World Trade Center and the Khobar Towers, it seemed a bit over the top at the time, but less so after 9/11.

I enjoyed Denzel Washington's performance a great deal as FBI agent Tony Hubbard.  Tony Shalhoub is superb as Agent Frank Haddad who is caught between his actual loyalties to America and his job and the ethnic hysteria a series of bombings has set off.  This is one of Shalhoub's few dramatic roles and he is terrific.  I would like to see more of them.  He provides intensity when interviewing a suspect, heartbreak, panic, and fury when his son is taken by the military when rounding up all Arab young men, and even comic relief when they break into a military surveillance team and he notices the kind of superior equipment they have to what he is used to and says, ""Microwave!"" It is a perfect moment.

Annette Bening's  Elise/Susan CIA character gives a solid performance in a role that is more of a function than a person.  They needed a female in there somewhere and she is definitely that, but her function is to show the inherent complications of the CIA and how one is never sure of much in the world of intelligence except that things are different than they seem on the surface.  This causes some problems for the movie's conclusion, which I cannot discuss.

Even worse than the cartoonization of the CIA is the demonization of the U. S. Military.  Poor Bruce Willis is given a thankless role as a completely unbelievable role of a U. S. General who wants nothing more than to bring martial law to the country to round up what he believes are a few dozen members of various cells plotting terror.  Puh-leeze.  Sure, the general mouths pleadings to not be set loose within the borders of the U.S., but that is like asking to not be thrown in the briar patch.  And he immediately resorts to brutal tactics including torture / murder and putting thousands of young Arab males into an improvised prison camp at a sports stadium.

Not only is this a completely stupid way to try and find a couple of dozen terrorists, it is guaranteed to create a worse political situation for the Washington politicians than they had with the bombing.  It is interesting to note that 9/11 was worse than anything in this movie and we responded to it with nothing like the reaction in the movie.

Still, the notion of the cells and their continuing work is quite interesting and shows the kind of difficulties our police and intelligence (and military) agencies have in fighting this very real war we are in.  I am not going to note the differences between the way the Arab leaders acted in the movie and the way CAIR and other Arab leaders have acted and spoken since 9/11, but I am sure you will notice them clearly.

Not a great film, but it has some pretty good moments provided almost exclusively by Shalhoub and Washington.  Bening and Willis give good efforts in roles undermined by nature of their roles and the script.",1156982400,4,3139,4.5579322638146165

Annette Benning pops up as the same person, but nobody is really sure who she really is which keeps you guessing.

The movie keeps you guessing, laughing and biting your fingernails down to the elbow. The building of dramatic tension doesn't stop, punctuated by well delivered lines by Tony Shaloub like ""The three of you make a lovely couple, really.""

The movie is politically polarized, but not not to the point where it distracts from the movie. The terrorists are portrayed in an admittedly overly-sympathetic light, but the movie mantains a beacon that despite our personal feelings, we won't beat terrorism with guns and bombs, but our brains.

Those people don't understand this film. There is no way that this movie would have been made after 9-11. The reason? Because those films would in fact be the biased ones. This film, however just shows a 'what-if' perspective. What if The US army invaded New York and took thousands of Muslims hostages? What if the army and FBI went toe-to-toe as to what they believe is right for this country?

1016673,2,6305364206,"I find the underlying propaganda of this film disturbing. The two key points it makes are

1) The terrorist attacks on New York are really our fault.  It's made abundantly clear that the only reason the terrorists are blowing up things and killing people is that WE betrayed them.  WE were evil enough to capture one of their leaders in a covert operation.  WE provoked them with our arrogant, self-serving, and imperialist policies.  So everything they do is understandable really.  What's most disturbing about this is that even when the writers show terrorists plant a bomb in an elementary school, fully prepared to vaporize a roomful of LITTLE GIRLS -- who are even shown crying, and wailing in fear -- this is not enough to make anyone (any of the good guys at least) observe that whatever the Islamists' grievances may be, NOTHING justifies such methods, and the Islamists' willingness to resort to such measures taints their cause beyond redemption.  Even the most obscene, cruel, and remorseless acts of terror and (would-be) child murder are not enough to shake the belief in moral equivalency so fervently held by Hollywood liberals.

At the core of this point is the belief that terrorist attacks on the U.S. are the result of U.S. actions and policies.  Well, they are.  But then again, the attack on Pearl Harbor was the result of U.S. policies also.  That does not mean the U.S. was wrong to refuse to sell war materiel to the brutal, imperialist regime that was running Japan, thus provoking them to attack us.  The Civil War was the result of U.S. policies.  That does not mean the U.S. was wrong to refuse to allow the southern states to secede and set up a government that would have perpetuated race based slavery. The fallacy of this argument is the implicit and automatic assumption that because something may be the result of U.S. polices, the U.S. is wrong for having those policies.  Many of our foreign policy decisions have indeed been wrong.  Some have been disastrous.  But we are not the ""Great Satan"" the Islamists portray us to be, and NOTHING justifies these hate-filled, Islamikaze fanatics in what they do.

2) Inside every high ranking army brasshat lurks a jack booted fascist just waiting to get out. In this film you see an army general, played by Bruce Willis, herd people into concentration camps, authorize and supervise the torture of prisoners, conduct illegal surveillance on federal agents, and basically use the Constitution as toilet paper.  Not only does Bruce Willis' character commit all the crimes I related above, but when he is confronted with the fact that he has incarcerated the son of an loyal American and FBI agent, his subordinate justifies this by saying the boy's father is a Shiite, and they will ""look into"" whether or not the father's 30 years of completely loyal service can override this.  The U.S. army, not the terrorists, is the real enemy.  The American general, not the fanatical, Islamofascist terrorist leader, is the real threat to life and liberty.  As historian Steven Ambrose once observed, in 1945, the most terrifying sight on earth was a squad of soldiers -- young, aggressive, armed men inured to violence.  That squad of soldiers all too often meant looting, rape, even murder.  And this applied no matter whether the uniform worn by these young men was German, Russian, Japanese, or any other... unless that uniform happened to be American or British.  When people saw those uniforms, they generally understood they were safe, and this applied to the people of enemy countries as well as liberated ones.  Historically, the U.S. armed forces have a better record than those of almost any other country.  Certainly they have a better record that the forces of any other armed forces of comparable size and power.  Americans in military service have, sometimes, committed atrocities and excesses, but they are still better behaved than the armed forces of almost any other country.  But that long record of restraint counts for nothing against isolated incidents like My Lai, so in the liberal view, as presented in this film, you can depend on American military excesses to be the rule, not the exception.

This film, while it works fairly well as a thriller, is the porduct of a liberal Hollywood cohort whose members are, as Mona Charen once said, ""...so marinated in cynicism about their own country that they find it difficult to discern evil in anyone else.""",1128816000,9,4446,4.898531375166889

If this scenario actually occured in NY (or any city for that matter), the citizens would demand the Army's presence to help keep them safe.  Protecting everyone's civil rights is mandatory in peacetime, but all bets are off when the streets are flowing red & martial law is declared.  When the General in-charge uses his authority to root out the terrorist cells, he morphs into a bigger threat than the terrorists.  Of course, the movie ends with his arrest in disgrace (by the FBI, no less).

1016676,1,6305364206,"Before I begin I'd just like point out that I am not reviewing this film as a work of ""art"" -- on that score, it seems just as good as most films, if not at least a little better -- but as a work of propaganda.  I will also try to avoid the mistake made by 99% of the customer reviewers on Amazon who think they have to recount the plot blow-by-blow, in excruciating detail (and often erroneous detail), even though a hundred other reviewers have already done so, and even though there is already a much better, more consice, and more accuarate Editorial Review at the top of every product page....

A couple of years before 9/11, Tom Clancy wrote a novel, ""The Sum of All Fears,"" about a group of Islamic extremist-terrorists who are planning to set off a nuclear device in America.  When Hollywood turned this film into a movie, also before 9/11, they decided that it was much more plausible and responsible to make the bad guys white-supremacist neo-nazis.  Golly, and they wonder why the rest of the country views most people in the entertainment industry as knee-jerk liberals?!

I saw ""The Siege"" when it first came out in theaters, and have recently viewed it again on television, and it seems even worse now than when I first saw it, because of 9/11.  At the time I saw the movie, I thought that it presented an implausible and unrealistic scenario regarding America's reaction to such a terrorist threat, but I did think they were presenting a plausible and realistic scenario regarding that terrorist threat.  When 9/11 happened, I was shocked and outraged, but I was also not surprised.  An open and free society such as ours has always been vulnerable to such attacks, and always will be -- AND SO WE STILL ARE.  The only thing that surprised me is that it has taken the terrorists so long to figure it out, and sometimes I think they still don't realize their potential.

Not all Arabs are Muslims, but most profess to be.  Not all Muslims are extremists or terrorists, but a very few are.  And ALL of the terrorists who caused 9/11 WERE.  If ""The Siege"" is any indication, Hollywood apparently thinks most of the unwashed masses in flyover country don't know this.  Hollywood apparently thinks that most Americans (or at least most White Americans) are racist, sexist, stupid, and evil.  Hollywood apparently thinks that America is more at fault for terrorism than the extremists.  Hollywood apparently thinks that it is unacceptable to point out that there are more than a few people in the Arab and Muslim communities who hold negatively stereotypical views of America, Christians, Israel, Jews, etc. and that the extremists use those stereotypes to justify their terrorism.  This is where ""The Siege"" fails.

After the worst terror incident in the film -- a truck bomb kills six hundred people in the building which houses the NYC FBI headquarters, effectively wiping out its anti-terroism agency -- having an army division occupy Brooklyn and declare martial law while they screen two thousand recent Arab immigrants that fit the profile of the twenty terrorists they are looking for hardly seems all that unreasonable.  In fact, the two-star general's rationale for this approach is quite logical.  But, of course, this is Hollywood, so this two-star general just has to be some sort of bigoted homicidal maniac who wraps himself in the flag and despises his president and the constitution.  After all, the only unacceptable government spending is on defense, and the only acceptable time to use the military is when we can guarantee that our country could not possibly benefit in any way from it -- anything less than perfect altruism is absolute corruption.  And, naturally, the military then proceeds to run amok in Brooklyn, torturing and murdering the innocent with impunity, all the while condemning any critics for daring to question their patriotism.  Funny, isn't it, how after five times as many people die on 9/11, a conservative Republican president reacts with far, far more restraint than ""The Siege""'s Bill Clinton?!  Sure, there have been abuses, but they have been the EXCEPTION, whereas ""The Siege"" posits that they would be the RULE.

What this film, and much of America, and much of the world, fail to understand is this:  what Osama bin Laden, Al Quaeda, Islamofascists and terrorist-extremists hate about US is that we are not exactly like THEM.  Some Palestinians, like the Nazis, will not be happy until there are no more Jews left breathing on the face of the earth.  The Islamofascists will not be happy until everyone on the planet who does not surrender to THEIR particular interpretation of Islam is DEAD.  Pulling out of Palestine, pulling out of Iraq, electing a liberal Democrat to the American presidency will NOT put an end to it.  In fact, NOTHING will put an end to it.  There will always be terrorism, terrorists, extremism, extremists, crime, criminals, etc.  But as long as we choose idealism over reality, we will only be giving them more power.  Remember, it is THEIR idealism that makes them so willing to kill and die for their cause....

One final note: remember that a work of fiction proves NOTHING.  No work of fiction can ""prove"" ANYTHING.  The writer is the god of his own fictional universe, and he gets to set all of the rules, so naturally what he writes ends up justifying his own point of view.  Imagine a presidential debate where only one candidate gets to speak -- for BOTH sides!  This is the case with ""The Siege,"" with Jack London's ""The Iron Heel,"" and pretty much any and all books and films.  So to call this film ""realistic"" or ""prophetic"" is patently absurd.  Still, I recommend seeing it at least once, whether you saw it before 9/11 or not.  The one thing that this film does prove, albeit unintentionally, is that Hollywood does make great propaganda.",1126396800,12,5838,4.809619238476954
1016677,5,6305364206,"When ""The Siege"" was originally released in 1998, it got mixed reviews and fared moderately at the box office. However, after 9/11, interest in this film spiked, and now is judged as ahead of its time since it depicts terrorism in such a similar way to what happened here in 2001 and what happened this month in London.

The film's plot seems fictional enough. FBI agent Anthony ""Hub"" Hubbard (Denzel Washington) is the leader of an FBI terrorism unit. When a dud bomb goes off on a bus, an investigation is launched. They come up emtpy until they hook up with Elise Kraft (Annette Benning), who helps them with their search. When a city bus blows up and the terrorists start attacking theaters, schools and even the FBI headquarters, the U.S. Army, led by William Deveraux (Bruce Wilis). However, the army declares marshal law on the city, and pretty much arrests every Muslim, Arab and Iraqi in the city, including Hubbard's partner's (Tony Shaloub) son. Hubbard is outraged with the treatment of the prisoners, and orders the FBI to arrest Deveraux. It all results in an unforgettable climax that will stay with you forever.

The film may not be 100 % realistic (I doubt we'll ever be under marshall law), but this film echoes the events of today so much it becomes disturbing to watch. I'd only recommend to certain people.",1122681600,4,1327,4.740259740259741

1016679,2,6305364206,"When I rented this movie, I had the feeling I'd already seen it before.  However, with the cast of Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, and Bruce Willis, I thought 'surely, this couldn't have been that forgettable.'

  Unfortunately, it was.  The only thing worse than watching a bad film once is not remembering how bad it was, and watching it again.  Allow me to explain why this film is grade ""A"" crap.

  I'm not here to argue with the politics of the film, or to go against the message.  I actually don't disagree with it.  The problem is, to make the message possible in the effectiveness of its delivery in the film, The relationship between the FBI and the Army has to become a horrendous, unrealistic cartoon.  I want to clarify that I have no problem with hypothetical and/or fantastic results in events portrayed in film, however, I do have a problem when they are flat out highly improbable, or impossible; under the assumption that this film is supposed to fairly and realistically portray the American response after a crisis.

  On a juvenile note, this movie is bait-and-switch to the max.  The back of the film talks about an 'all out war' when martial law is declared... and crap like 'non-stop action!'. Well, folks, this movie has about as much action as ""Cold Mountain.""  What we do get is a flurry of preachy political anthems and mediocre dialogue.

  For anyone who has the common sense to understand the relationship between the CIA, HSA, FBI and Army, this movie will piss you off beyond belief.  All other agencies are antagonized until becoming cartoon evils, except for the FBI.

  My 'favorite' part in the film happens when Annette Bening is dying and begins to recite the Lords prayer.  Denzel, hovering above her, joins her emotional last words with quiet murmurs and soft movements of his lips.  Near the end of her recital, she says quite clearly, ""Praise Allah.""

  This makes no sense in correlation to plot trajectory, character development, or sensibility of the film.  It's offensive, it doesn't make sense, and It's indulgent writing and directing with no concern for the obviousness of stupid throw-ins and scenarios.

  What I just described above is a concentrated account of what the entire film is like.  I was angry, disappointed, and felt manipulated, especially when Denzel's character delivered the same speech twice.

1016680,3,6305364206,"One can't fault the quality of movie-making in THE SIEGE.  Director Edward Zwick has crafted a tense, involving thriller with superior performances from Denzel Washington, Annette Bening, Bruce Willis and Tony Shalhoub.  However, in trying to be politically correct, we are forced to watch people march in protest as Arab Americans are grantedly wrongfully imprisoned in camps reminiscent of WWII Japanese.  However, where were these protesters when innocent people were being killed in buses and movie theaters.  The script also tries to evoke sympathy for the character of Shamir (spelling) who is Bening's convenient informant/lover.  We are asked to understand his motivations, knowing full well he is not the ""angel"" Bening tries to paint, or rather the script tries to paint.  The script once again decries the American government for its covert handling of terrorists like the shiek, who remember did cause the murders at the American barracks.  The movie also shows that the Americans do not know how to effectively handle these kind of terrorists.  Remember, these people believe they will go to heaven, so suicide bombing is nothing to them.  Why Willis and crew thought they could torture someone is beyond me; they do not care if they die.  How to effectively handle this type of terrorist remains a paradoxical problem.  But back to the movie:  some fine cinematography, some truly riveting and gut-wrenching moments, and a good score by Graeme Revell.  However, in trying to play all sides of the cards, it seems to have lost its focus on what really mattered.",1105574400,,1574,5.125490196078432
1016681,1,6305364206,"Learn there is no reasoning with fanatics. This ""politically correct"" piece of fluff blames - as usual - the West in general, and the Americans in particular for the terrorist attacks. The message: ""The Arabs only blow up innocent civilians because they were provoked, and they use American money and know-how to make them"". So now you know: ""it's all your own fault if you get bombed"".

That's sickening in my book. The movie begins promising, but near the end everything goes awfully pear-shaped.

At the end, the ""Evil American General"", played by Bruce Willis, get's thrown in jail by the ""Hero"", for torturing a terrorist, who is vigorously defended by Washington's character, as if he were a saint instead of the leader of a terrorist cell. ""Terrorists have rights too"" they firmly want to put across here. To justify this message, they have the ""Evil American General"" not only torture the terrorist (to get info), but also shoot him (all off screen), without any logical motivation. Apparently that's what American Generals do, or so they want us to believe.

""The public"" in this flick is (of course) ""outraged"" at the Army, deployed by the President, in order to prevent further terrorist attacks, and round up the remaining terrorist cell(s). Somehow no-one was protesting after two massacres of innocent Americans (a bus and a cinema full of defenseless people blown up), but when 200 young Arabs are detained for questioning, the angry crowds claim the streets, rooting for the Arabs. How very odd, but apparently that's what ""politically correct"" people do...

I'm sure Osama and friends must have laughed their heads off at the blatant display of so much Western self hatred. God forbid, they even may have found some inspiration here. They surely weren't blamed all that much in this horrid piece of film (that would put all those ravings about ""haunting"" and ""before it's time"" in quite a different perspective, wouldn't it...?)

Even Annette Benning apparently had to whisper ""Insjallah"" as her dying word (conveniently placed at the end of the Our Father, no doubt in an attempt to silence any criticism). So even here Allah had to have the last word so it seems. Again, very ""politically correct"" no doubt.

So what's the message here? ""Not all Arabs are bad""? That would be rather patronizing and insulting, wouldn't it? Everyone with half a brain knows this. It's about religious fanaticism, not about race. We surely don't need this movie to tell us that. So it must be the same-old, same-old: ""it's all the fault of the West"" dogma then...  or perhaps: ""just be nice to terrorists and they will change career"", ""we Westerners forced these poor souls into terrorism"", and more of such sickening nonsense.

A stunning display of ignorance about what makes these fanatics tick. To them, every non-Muslim is an enemy, who must die. That doesn't have the same ring to it as ""we are the oppressed"", so you won't hear them say it that much. Unless you speak Arab, and take the trouble to visit a fundamentalist Mosque that is. Then you learn the ugly truth no-one likes to hear. Being nice doesn't cut it (as also becomes clear in the choice of the final target in this movie). Convert to Islam, or die. There are no other options in their book of terror.

This movie, or rather it's patronizing ""message"", is infuriating at best. However, one thing became shockingly clear - if you didn't know it already: the so called ""politically correct"" activist types are complicit for weakening our society, to a point where it's become deadly ill and almost defenseless. That's maybe even scarier than the terrorists themselves. How do you fight something that's firmly rooted inside already? Not that easy as fighting an enemy in some conveniently far away country, now is it...

One line from the movie keeps ringing in my head: ""the most determined will win"". They hit the nail on the head with that one... We all know - finally, and way too late - how very determined these religious fanatics are - they are willing to die for their (warped) beliefs. As one of the terrorists says ""this is not the last cell, there will always be others, this is only the beginning"". Strangely, that sounds very believable...

And how about us...? How determined are we...?

Reading some of these reviews makes me fear the worst. Especially those written after 9/11. Milk and cookies anyone, after we sing ""We Are The World"" all together? For gods sake, what does it take for some to wake up? How many more innocent victims have to die by the hands of these Islamic terrorists?

When will we ever learn? It's past midnight already, whether you like it or not. Sorry if that doesn't fit all that neatly in your ""politically correct"" world view.

Wake up. Our freedom and our very lives are at stake here. There's a war going on. It's looking very different from any other war we know (of), and we are the target. If you don't believe me, ask them... But prepare to be shocked if you learn the truth.

Enveloped in a collective paranoid terror, citizens of New York City crouch and drop to the ground at the sound of a bus backfiring. The government responds by declaring martial law and breaking regulations: First, the US Army cannot be used against the American people, and second, the government cannot legally invade the privacy of its citizens. Although this movie was before the Patriot Act, which allows law enforcement agencies to gather information from emails and cell phones, the extent to which the Army goes in The Siege is far beyond the tenets of the Patriot Act.
  Anyway, it is a great movie, and I cannot see why someone would find this movie racist. The Arab citizens are portrayed as normal people just like everybody else, and just because a movie contains a scene in which Arabs are sent to internment camps (en masse) does not mean that the creater of the film believes that this is correct.

1016739,2,6305364206,"One night, I was at a friends' sleepover and his family got a brand-new DVD player (keep in mind, this was a few years ago when DVD players started selling like the bubonic plague...) and they bought a few DVDs that we were going to watch.  The first one we happened to watch was 1998's ""The Siege,"" starring Denzel Washington and directed by the talented Edward Zwick, best known for directing the epic ""Glory,"" which also starred Washington, and the recent ""Last Samurai.""  Both were grand epics with a moving story and a grand dose of acting talent and beautiful visuals.  Now, ""The Siege"" is a different kind of film, but with the talent involved, this movie fell below my expectations.
Washington stars as ""Hub,"" an FBI agent leading a team in finding the terrorists responsible for a series of bombings in New York.  They often refer to them as ""cells,"" which I am assuming as groups or an organization of some type; the film is never really clear what a ""cell"" is.  Tony Shalhoub plays Frank, FBI partner and an American of Arab descent, and also feels threatened by the United States when The President sends a crazed general (Bruce Willis) to install martial law on New York, which causes every Arab-descented individual to be locked up, including Frank's son.  Annette Bening plays a CIA spy attempting to crack the case and has some involvement as well...
I must say Edward Zwick still has his directorial flair for entertainment, but the screenplay could've used some serious modifications.  The movie jumps around a lot without a clear focus.  We also never really know WHY the Arabs are bombing New York in the first place.  The acting in it isn't very good either... which is sad for me to say, because both Willis and Washington are fine actors.  They seem like they're trying too hard in their roles.  Bening was ok.  Shalhoub is probably the best remembered actor out of all of them; he portrayed a sense of angst and rage for this crisis which unfortunately involves his son.
The movie also makes me a little upset because it portrays America in such a dark light.  I know that my country is not perfect, but SERIOUSLY, I don't think OUR OWN COUNTRY WOULD DECLARE MARTIAL LAW ON A MAJOR CITY ON THE DROP OF A DIME, much less imprison every Arab-American just because they're Arab.  This is one area that has bothered many reviewers here (i.e. claiming it's racist).  I really can't make a judgement on that since it's not very clear in the film; we see the ""good"" side with Shalhoub's character, yet the Arab-Americans are being imprisoned without discussion.  And Willis' character... he's an annoying twit.  Is our military that pompous?  The ending seemed really contrived and failed to solve any mysteries.
Overall, this was a disappointing film for me.  It's not very clear what's going on.  Sadly, this film came out before the Sept. 11 events that damaged our country, yet now it's selling more than before just because of the Arab/American conflict portrayed in it.

1016740,5,6305364206,"As I am half Lebanese myself, I do not agree with the many claims that this movie is racist.  First of all, it gives a glimpse of the Islamic and Arab community in New York City and shows some positive aspects of their culture, and second, the protagonist has a Lebanese partner.  I think that many Arabs who did find this movie racist were more worried about the subject manner.  Most Arabs living in America are very patriotic, often to the point where they loathe seeing negative aspects of the American government as much as many European Americans.  This was a movie that tried to show, in addition to terrorism, exactly what the American government is capable of when it feels threatened by a particular ethnicity or political persuasion; as exemplified by the internment camps which were created for Shiite Moslems and the scene where the suspected terrorist is tortured and shot.  These acts were not an attempt by the movie-makers to say that they approve of it but to show the extremities to which military officials can be driven.  In the aforementioned internment camp scene a moment is even taken to address Arab pride, as Tony Shaloub's character throws his badge at Denzel Washington's character and says, ""Tell them I'm not their sand-ni**er anymore.""

But now, after the you-know-what in 2001, the theme, the perspectives, the sheer predicament of things, and most importantly, the message of the movie are stunning in their frightening reality. Much of the city under ""siege"" could have been a doozy idea in 1998, but in 2003 it doesn't seem to be that distant a possibility. Could this have given Al Quaeda the ideas it needed for 911?
I am not sure why some reviewers rant about this being an anti-Islamic or anti-Arab propoganda. The movie shows a clear distinction between the good guys (Denzel's colleague in FBI is an Arab too) and the fanatics who plan to blow up buildings with no remorse all in the name of ""allah"". This film isn't about anti-ethnic sentiment, it's more about paranoia and hasty decision making brought about by reactionary leadership (such as the extant one, of course).
The story clicks on all of the present hot buttons such as terrorism in NYC, America's militant retaliation, and the futility of such belligerence in ridding the world of terrorism. It is unnerving to to think of how much our world has changed since this movie first came out so many years previously and that a film that was made to be entertaining and an escape from our real everyday life now is now a reminder of some very recent and real tragic events (7-11, US snipper shootings). It is no longer entertaining to watch because of it's subject matter (terrorism/random acts of killings), location (New York City), presentation (highly realistic news coverage soundbites), fly overs of NYC skyline with Twin Towers, visuals NYC finest rushing in to help the victims and the shot of the whole in the blown out building (troublingly similar to Ground Zero site as it looks now) etc, but still paints an alarmingly accurate of our world as it stands today.
The title of the movie could be a little better. ""Siege"" is such a hackneyed word in Hollywood. Perhaps it was the glam-bam marketing that did the movie in, but it is an absolutely riveting, thought provoking thriller that will stun you with its realism, and with its gutwrenching perspectives on the futility of war and terrorism, regardless of their form or endorsement.

As the Army General who is eventually given the task of setting up the rules of martial law in New York City and taking control of the situation.  Bruce's character argues against martial law and tries to explain to anyone who will listen that the U.S. Army is something that they do not want involved in this.  That the army is not a swift sword but a massive blunt device that can not surgically remove the problem.  But no one heads his message and when he is ordered to take control he does so with brute force.  Setting up ""concentration camps"" of Arab Americans and shutting down the exits from the city with tanks.  Tanks in New York City!  Is it far fetched to think it is possible if the terrorism gets worse on our soil, that we could set up these types of camps?
Again and again we see the different views of how to proceed from the FBI, CIA and U.S. Armed Forces.  A study in our government and their reaction in a small way.  This movie was an eye opening when it came out but unfortunately written off as nonbelievable by too many.

1016789,4,6305364206,"It is atrocious the way our society and Western countries have treated Arabs in real life and reel life in the past century and recently.  That is why one should see this movie.

The movie was well written, well directed, well acted- especially Bruce Willis and Denzel Washington.  It was enjoyable to watch, a work of art, gripping, and thought provoking.  Thus it is sad the Arab-American community so completely missed the point of the movie, but understandable. There were many protests of this movie for being anti-Arab when it came out. However, Arab-Americans largely do not relate to the great Tragedy and Atrocity that European-Americans committed in WWII, with the Japanese concentration camps. They largely do not experience the collective guilt and shame over such evil, stereotyping loyal Americans simply because of their ethnicity and resemblance to the enemy. This is the point of The Siege. It is quite clear from the movie that the real evil is not the Arab Terrorist, but Bruce Willis' character, as the tragic villain who realizes the crime against humanity which he has perpetuated. The most moving moment in the film is seeing the round up of Arab-Americans. It is seeing America do the same thing it did 50 years ago to the Japanese, and for the same reasons- Ignorance bred from Fear.  The movie had to have Arabs as the terrorists, in order to warn against the very plausible evil of typing all Arabs as evil. Far from a token Arab guy on the FBI team, the one FBI individual focuses us on how we look for tokenism and stereotyping in order to morally assuage ourselves.

The film shows the constitution applying only if you are not of Arabic descent- as today. We need more films like this in order for America to see what it is doing because of it's fear. There are only about 10 films in movie history that show Arabs in a good light- out of about 1,000 depicting Arabs (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reel-Bad-Arabs/dp/1566563887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reel Bad Arabs</a>&nbsp;by Jack Shaheen).

1016790,4,6305364206,"NOTE: This review was written May, 1999
A decade ago, a movie like The Siege might have been written off as a paranoid scenario produced by an overactive imagination. Today, this tale of Federal government agencies' fighting over how to deal with a series of terrorist attacks seems almost too plausible. Its realism may have lowered its entertainment quotient.
The main characters each represent an agency responsible for protection this nation and its citizens. Denzel Washington is Anthony, a highly placed agent in the FBI's New York City office. Elise [Annette Bening] is a veteran CIA agent, while Gen. William Devereaux [Bruce Willis] represents the Army.
Followers of a missing Arab terrorist leader begin a systematic series of attacks on public places in The Big Apple. These become progressively larger and more horrendous. The problem is compounded by the fact that the demands of the terrorists are vague. The identity of the culprits is hard to figure out. The idea that they are on a suicide mission becomes increasingly evident.
The action sequences of this thriller are by the book, and the characters are fairly stock ones. Still, the story manages to be above average. Its creators realized that this was a complex subject. How would our government handle such a situation? How can we know? It's never happened before on such a massive scale. Would we remain level headed, or would we rush to mandate martial law? Could the result of such events be our relinquishing our own freedoms? While The Siege has a proper movie climax, the makers do not pretend to have the answers.
The issue of big government is also addressed. The Federal government is so vast and bureaucratic that the movie suggest that different agencies would respond in different ways. Lines of communication between the FBI, the CIA and the Armed Forces are not clearly defined. Perhaps they would fight - and thus cancel out - each other. The Presidency and the Congress have become so politically polarized that their coming up with a quick, unified answer does seem a bit farfetched. A variation of the nightmare scenario that The Siege suggests seems probable.
Washington, Bening and Willis are always professional and fun to watch. In this case, they are given fairly sketchy characters to work with. This is the film's main failing. There are moments of edge-of-your-seat thrills. The plot is thought provoking. But with all the ""heroes"" having an aura of cardboard about them, it is hard for the movie to involve the audience as deeply as it might have. This is a shame, because it prevents The Siege from being the best movie thriller of recent years.",1016841600,2,2646,4.948314606741573
1016791,1,6305364206,"I've got no problem with far-fetched plots, but let's not get carried away. There needs to be something believable, and in this movie, nothing was. Denzel Washington plays an Assistant Special Agent in Charge of the New York Field office of the FBI. Faced with a terrorist hoax, the FBI team goes into action, jumping right into the middle of a real terrorist cell that is beginning to blow things up. Somehow, the New York FBI and numerous other intelligence agencies had no clue a terrorist cell was operating in Brooklyn. With belated help from a rouge NSA (actually, National Security Council [???]) agent, the FBI think's it's got it's hands on the terrorists. But after repeated bombings, the President decides martial law is in order (yea, right) and sends in Bruce Willis and the Army to lock down New York and immediately start butting heads with the FBI.
OK, fine. There's interagency rivalries. That's nothing new. But Washington's character, an ASAC, apparantly has the autonomy to run an entire investigation of unprecedented domestic terrorism without any input or supervision from Washington (D.C.) and the DOJ. That's just plain dumb. There was no point in this movie that was the least bit interesting. Not one. Nothing here was even remotely life-like.",1012003200,4,1270,5.023696682464455
1016792,4,6305364206,I wrote a review for this movie before Sep 11 and was annoyed because of its portrayal of Muslims and some of the casting decisions made in the movie. My review still stands and you can read it if you dig deep in the Amazon.com web site. But I must commend Edward Zwick when I saw this again after Sep 11. What I felt then was that Mr. Zwick was imagining something implausible. Anyway the worst nightmare has actually come true and real life was even more dramatic then the events shown in the movie. Do watch this one as it is a very engaging story and its portrayal of Arab American especially Tony Shalhoub's acting is spot on. If Mr. Zwick had dwelt on the reasons for the Arab outrage against Israel and America the movie would have gotten five stars from me.,1011571200,5,765,4.319444444444445
1016793,5,6305364206,"Having watched The Siege before, the events of September 11 were a reality check.  One of the first things I thought upon hearing that planes had hit the World Trade Center was of this movie.
While this is a fictional account, it is a somber reminder of what could have happened in real life.  Watching this movie after the attacks, it takes on an entirely different meaning to me.  Everyone has changed in some fashion after the tragedy, and this movie is an example of just how confident we were in our national security.
Denzel Washington, in the lead role, portrays a very convincing anti-terrorism agent with the F.B.I.  The casting of Tony Shaloub (Wings) as his Arab-American partner brings the other side of the argument into play - being blamed for something because you share a race or some other identifiable characteristic with a group.  While this movie was not meant to be any sort of documentary or reality-based production, it also manages to provide a sense of understanding about what the FBI has to do when investigating such incidents.  This movie was good before the attacks, now it it much more meaningful for them.",1003190400,7,1137,4.775510204081633

I have decided to rerent this movie and decide to search for any realism. Tragically most of the things in this movie are realistic. Such as the function of terrorist cells. A terrorist mind etc.
And a more disturbing thing. The government was planning to detain any suspected Arab immigrant (note not American Arabs) for 48 hours without warrant in the new anti terrorist bill (in the movie arabs were rounded up and were sent to a makeshift interment camp) but thankfully the bill has been altered so those events will not take place. for now at least.
In final conclusion this is one of the good movies that talks about terrorism. But it also teaches you that intolerance to a goup is wrong",1002067200,10,828,4.601351351351352

Many things that has happened to the muslim community both the good and the bad(execpt the martial law) has happened.

Zwick simply distilled the terrorist-threat Zeitgeist in the US into a film that the masses could absorb, and instead we get know-it-alls calling it a bad piece of screenplay and poorly executed.  The truth is, the issue of terrorists has long been a part of our lives, just maybe not our western lives, and a far greater threat has materialised.  Im sure like so many other people, your faces have been glued to CNN this past week, most likely you would have received a swell of satisfaction when US administators promised retribution on those responsible for the attacks.  Included in this was Bush's recommendation for an 'international coalition' to combat the threat.  Face it, violations of the constitution are occurring everyday in controlled hidden environments, now, with the instition of a united global government, leaders can legitimise their crimes using the protection of citizens as an excuse.  From now on, with the US's beastly budget, the affairs of said government will most likely be decided from there, and every other country will be locked into passive submission. Thats the future, you can kiss your amendments goodbye.  I just find it shocking how every movie and media failed to predict the scope of the recent tragedy... martial law in ""the siege"" was waved off as hollywood fantasy, well now we have martial war, and the number of lives at stake is hundreds of times higher.

They talk of knocking out ""cells"" and how terror operates in our country's borders. Annette Benning is brilliant as the CIA agent with ambivalent sympathies. Denzel Washington, working with Director of ""Glory,"" Edward Zwick,with Washingtom winning a Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for that great Civil War drama, gives a powerful performance. But the details-my God if any movie was prophetic it is ""The Siege."" Now that we are seemingly headed full tilt into a full-scale war, have we learned anything? This movie was made in 1998 and last Tuesday, September 11, 2001, mirrors the sagas and themes so closely that it is uncanny. Rent this movie if you have only one movie to rent, rethink what you have learned about terrorists and controlling them. In the day and age of worthless movies of little content, this movie stands tall in every department. What is so sad is that many watched it and thought it was a ""fantasy."" The World Trade Center no longer exists. Thousands of people are missing and the ruins are still smoking as I write these words in tears and sorrow. We have met the enemy and he is us.

This movie depicts terrorist bombings by Islamic militants in New York which, though frighteningly realistic, are fictitious. Unfortunately as Washington D.C., southwestern PA, the real New York, and the entire United States discovered on September 11, reality is often much more frightening than any movie.

1016816,4,6305364206,"When it was first released in December 1998, THE SIEGE was ridiculed as a propaganda attack in its story of New York becoming a literal prison after a series of devastating terrorist attacks on the Big Apple, as well as depicting anyone of a Moslem background as being guilty by association.
Now, unfortunately, that attitude has pretty much dissipated because of what happened on September 11, 2001.  THE SIEGE has grown into something far more frightening.  No longer can it be seen as just another stereotypical Hollywood action film.  Its scenes of terror, destruction, and racism hit just a bit too close to home now, and that's why it is so effective despite whatever flaws it might have.
Denzel Washington is the very conscientious FBI agent trying to catch the terrorist cells responsible for a series of horrible attacks that, once they've escalated into acts that kill hundreds in his FBI office, lead to the sealing off of the city by the Army, as led by a right-wing general (Bruce Willis). Besides providing the requisite thrills that are familiar to anyone who has seen DIE HARD or SPEED or any 1970s all-star disaster movie, THE SIEGE also warns us against judging certain groups of people as being responsible before all the facts are in.
If THE SIEGE can bring anything positive to us, besides supposedly ""cheap"" Hollywood thrills, it can teach us that xenophobia towards people who are different is dead wrong.",1000252800,3,1428,4.892561983471074

1016818,4,6305364206,"""The Siege"" attempts on numerous occasions to be provocative in its ideas, but it doesn't quite cover all its bases. There are some very powerful and intense action sequences, and some of the best actors on the market giving wonderful performances. When you add all of this together, what you get is a combination of good action, a few thrills, and a story that supplies enough of both for you to forgive its shortcomings.
The film's action centers around various terrorist attacks in New York City, beginning with a hoax paint bomb on a city bus, and a real explosion aboard another afterwards. Under the leadership of special agent Anthony Hubbard (Denzel Washington), the FBI begins investigating possible leads as to the people responsible for the bombings, crossing paths with CIA spy Elise Kraft (Annette Bening), who has some personal ties to a local Arab.
And since the Arabs are in the hot seat of suspicion, Hubbard and Elise form a team of sorts to track down the remaining cells of terrorists. But an attack on the FBI headquarters pushes the President over the edge, and he orders military forces into New York City to contain those under suspicion (including any and all citizens of Middle East descent), causing an uproar among the city's population and forcing Hubbard and a small band of FBI agents to take matters into their own hands.
Throughout the film, there are some very spectacular action sequences that are effective in delivering edge-of-your-seat thrills. A scene involving Hubbard's attempts at negotiation with the terrorists aboard the second bus is tightly wound, while the mayhem and that ensues throughout the city in the face of each attack can be chilling at times.
The story makes good use of social unrest, undoubtedly recalling Japanese-Americans treatment during World War II. This tactic comes close to feeling detached, but Arab-American agent Frank Haddad's search for his detained son provides an emotional outlet for the audience to connect with.
Yet, with all of these thrills, the overall effect falls a fraction short. The material is intelligent and well-crafted, but place it in the same light as such thrillers as ""The Negotiator"" or ""Outbreak,"" and this film pales in comparison. I can't, in all honesty, say that the story's central message was completely compelling, but while I wasn't fully moved by that, I wasn't put off by it, either.
But the action alone is worth watching, and so are the involving performances from the star-studded cast. Denzel Washington employs a great deal of leadership qualities into his character, and carries much of the movie's force on his shoulders. Annette Bening is subtly mysterious as Elise, who knows more about the terrorist attacks than she's willing to reveal. Bruce Willis is a knockout as General William Devereaux, who verbally objects to the involvement of the armed forces in the city, yet seems quite comfortable once in control.
There's enough action and suspense throughout ""The Siege"" to keep you entertained, and just enough plot twists to keep you guessing. The overall effect you may feel after the last frame may be a bit less than what you expected, but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying this tightly-knit thriller.",999648000,3,3229,5.037383177570093

It is about terrorist attacks in New York by Arab extremists and our government's reaction to it. I understand that Arab American groups have protested this film. I don't understand why because, on the contrary, it does much to promote understanding by depicting the result of over-reaction. Indeed, Brooklyn is put under siege. Arab-American young males are rounded up. And democracy flies out the window. A chilling thought. The casting is perfect. Each character really gets into his or her role. And the budget is big enough to have overhead airplane shots and special effect explosions.

Most of the characters here are superb, and I find them believable. The story is compelling and there is suspense to discover what will happen next and where will terrorism next strike. Will the characters in the movie manage to trace the next steps of the terrorists and head off terrorist strikes before they happen? Or will a state of martial law occur? (Bruce Willis makes an excellent all-business militaristic character here). The only real flaw is Annette Bening who is annoying at best as the know-it-all ""I know these people best"" character who gets herself killed for being as trusting and smug as she was. Perhaps this is how her character was supposed to be perceived, but I have rarely seen her act differently from this... sort of a maniacal, overbearing and annoying person... which she plays in Regarding Henry with Harrison Ford and perfects in American Beauty.

1016987,2,6305364206,"This movie started out well and with a good premise: terrorism in the US. Mid-way through the movie, it became this preachy junk about how we shouldn't judge people just because they are the same nationality or race  as some bad guys. Well, Duh! It's political correctness run amok as you  must suspend disbelief if you have any hope of enjoying this movie.  Hopefully, someone will do a movie along these lines that makes some sense.",948499200,4,434,4.684210526315789
1016988,1,6305364206,"This movie is an abomination motivated by the anti-Muslim and particularly Anti-Arab hate propoganda. Supporters of this lame flick cite that it isn't Islamphobic because "" it makes a point which people missed"" or  "" they didn't get it"" No dice, thrashing the major world religion  and its practices to ""make a point"" is a cop out and illogical  justification based on an immoral premise. Did Speilberg thrash Judaism to  ""make a point"" in Schindler's list ? Ofcoarse not ! Its a real  shame that a talented actor like Denzel signed on for this movie, Annette  seemed out of place and out of class...and Bruce Willis had zero appeal  both the general and an actor. The direction was awfull. Such Anri-Semetic  (Jews AND Arabs are semetic peoples) thrash being made in this day and age  is disgrace. Already one bigot's review tells us that it makes him  ""understand terrorism by Islamic militants,"" nevermind the fact  such idiots convienently ignore social, political, and economic  considerations as well as the US role in initiating hostilities in the  Middle East. Thankfully, this ""movie"" flopped badly at the  box-office, its a good sign that not all of us have become shallow and  ignorant simpletons who buy into anything with a few expolosions and other  special effects. If you want to watch a real movie, get ""the  Message"" directed by Moustapha Akkad starring Anthony Quinn, you'll  get you're moneys worth with special effects and an excellent acting and NO  stereotyping.",944956800,13,1485,4.987755102040817

Terrorism is a real threat to all Nations, and I believe this movie gave the right impression of the horrors  of it.  The Siege also put down the stereotypes of Arabs, and followers of  Islam through the Arab FBI agent and showing how wrong it was to blame all  Arabs for the actions of only a few.

1016990,2,6305364206,"I have seen this movie, not a big deal!  I mean the events are predictable from the start. It is like most movies. Hunt the bad guys, capture them, then kill them, the hero lasts. Nothing new or unusual about  the movie in general, but it shows Arabs as Terrorists!  There was no  need to show some arab guys praying or citing some verses from the Holy  Quran, pretending to be very Confide and defend Islam & then in another  seen goes to bed with a stranger for Adultery!",941760000,,473,4.258426966292135
1016991,5,6305364206,"Although some people my say that this film is boring and slow, I think it shows how susceptible we are. This movie should be seen by all people who believe in the current system and people who believe that the military  should be deployed to attack serious issues. The movie itself attacks  serious issues. It shows how a country like America can be brought back to  the dark ages and how you should be careful what you wish for, because you  might just get it. The Acting by Bruce Willis is outstanding how he  portrays a cold-blooded, power hungry general. This movie is aimed at  people who have a attention span of more than 1 hour, if this is not you,  then you probably will find this movie as boring and slow.",931651200,4,716,4.378787878787879

1017078,3,6305364206,"I went into The Siege with high hopes for a thinking person's aaction thriller, and what I got contained too little in either thought or thrills, leaving a film which straddles the line too uncomfortably for its own  equilibrium.  The unidimensional quality of Bruce Willis's governmental  presebts completely sabotaged the human rights aspect of the film, while  Denzel Washington's cerebral FBI agent never really captured the soul of an  action hero.
What did impress me were the set pieces -- the bus scene,  the actual stadium sequence -- and two performances.  Annette Bening did a  credible job as someone who has begun to believe their own cover story, but  best of all was Tony Shalhoub as the Arab-American FBI agent, who brought  dignity, anger and humor to an underwritten part.
Two more comments.  The  reviewers who feel that the film is racist because of its portrayals of  Arabs/Muslims are missing the point.  The film shows quite clearly that  those who lump all members of an ethnic group together because of the  actions of a few individuals are terribly wrong-headed.  It is unfortunate  that Arab terrorists have become a common foil for heroic Americans in  action films, but with the demise of the Communist menace, Hollywood has to  take what it caan get.  And face it -- there are Arab terrorists, Russian  thugs, Hispanic gang members and Italians involved in organized crime.  Showing them does not necessarily imply that all members of that ethnic  group have those qualities, any more than Psycho was meant to imply that  all momma's boys were psychopaths.  Arab Americans should rejoice at this  film, in my opinion, because it contains sympathetic characters on thaat  group, which is all too rare.  A film where the only Arab characters are  terrorists or thieves or foul and corrupt wardens would be objectionable,  but this one does not suffer from that fault.
And second, Wesley Snips  was not in this movie.",928368000,14,1944,4.959501557632398
1017079,3,6305364206,"While the Siege is a decent evenings entertainment, it does sort of require that you send your brain away for two hours.  There are plot holes aplenty which, for the most part, Denzel Washington's solid performance  make up for.  Annette Bening's role could have been better written.  As a  matter of fact, I think she's a bit miscast.  She does however try, which  is more than I can say for Bruce Willis who barely acts at all.  He's  perfected the art of smugness.  While I gave it three stars it's actually  closer to two and a half.",926726400,2,537,4.43298969072165
