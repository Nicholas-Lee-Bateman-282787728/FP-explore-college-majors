2211731,3,B0007GP74Q,"Nice DVD, but I really wish it had more than 6 episodes. Why can't they just make an entire season set?",1367366400,,103,3.9523809523809526
2211732,5,B0007GP74Q,"I actually bought this movie as a Christmas present for my four-year-old daughter.  We have read all the Angelina Ballerina books we could find at our local library, and I thought she might like a movie.  Well, she not only likes the movie, she loves it.  I sat down to watch it with her the first time she viewed it and thought it was a cute movie.",1352419200,,349,4.17910447761194
2211733,5,B0007GP74Q,There are always good lessons to be learned as Angelina works her way through her dilemmas. My granddaughter loves these DVDs and the cartoon design is excellent with lots of detail. The voices are also delightful.,1316390400,,214,4.972222222222222
2211734,5,B0007GP74Q,Bought two Angelina DVDs for granddaughter.  she loves Angelina and is starting ballet so they were very appropriate.  Very good condition and came quickly.,1301616000,,156,5.458333333333333
2211735,5,B0007GP74Q,I love the Angelina Ballerina video series.  They inspire young dancers while teaching them the life skills necessary for the art.,1247529600,,130,5.190476190476191
2211736,5,B0007GP74Q,"My 4-year-old is just beginning to get interested in ballet and dance and the Angelina Ballerina stories and DVDs provide loads of inspiration whilst serving to entertain at the same time.

There are 4 episodes altogether [12 mins each] - ""The Royal Banquet"", ""Angelina The Mouse Detective"", ""Angelina's Baby Sister"", and ""The Costume Ball""

The animated stories remain faithful to the source material by Katharine Holabird, and retain the original illustrations by Helen Craig. The quality of the animation is above average, lending an almost real-life quality to the little mice, and the language is clear [British accent is used here]. In between the animated episodes, there are scenes of actual dance lessons, either ballet, folk or others.

I'd highly recommend the Angelina Ballerina series of DVDs to aspiring young dancers, those who love immersing themselves in a world inhabited by adorable little mice and this is probably suited to preschoolers and up.",1240790400,5,965,5.294117647058823
2211737,5,B0007GP74Q,"This is a great book, my grandchildren love it. It also came in plenty of time for Christmas.",1231632000,,93,4.222222222222222
2211738,4,B0007GP74Q,"Love the stories on this DVD.  Angelina is a sweet, soothing show that is good for calming and entertaining little ones at the end of the day.  My 2-year-old twins enjoy seeing Angelina dance.  I like hearing the British accents as well.",1170806400,4,237,4.595238095238095
2211739,5,B0007GP74Q,My grandaughter who is 3 1/2 loves Angelina.  She likes to play with her Angelina doll while watching the video.  Cute and age appropriate video.,1168560000,3,145,4.76
2211740,5,B0007GP74Q,"My 3- and 2-yr-old absolutely LOVE Angelina Ballerina, so I wanted to get a few of her DVDs since it doesn't come on PBS very often. They adore this video, and they'll sit and watch it over and over--although I try to limit that b/c it only has four episodes on it, and I don't want them to get tired of it. It's also not over-stimulating, so it's a great way to wind down before naps or bed.

I think other reviewers have complained about having to watch commercials to get to the episodes, but I just hit the skip forward button on my DVD player, and it passes right over them--even the FBI warnings, which is very unusual.

No complaints here! And it's a great way to start talking about social interactions and siblings. The episode about Angelina's new baby sister is a special favorite, especially since we have two sisters very close in age. I think it never occurred to them that it was OK to be frustrated with having a sister before!",1141257600,14,943,4.382857142857143

8047374,4,B0007GP74Q,My granddaughter loves it! I haven't watched it yet myself. Maybe she'll bring it when she comes to visit. Wish they didn't live so far away!,1394582400,,141,4.461538461538462
8047375,3,B0007GP74Q,"I ordered this for my niece as a Christmas gift. She is 3 1/2 and into ballet and Angelina Ballerina books. I thought she would like this DVD for that reason, though I have never seen the TV show before. I have only read a few of the books.

Unfortunately, my sister says these episodes are too dramatic for my niece. Angelina overreacts to simple setbacks and generally doesn't cope well. This type of drama might be entertaining for girls around 6 or 7 years of age, but for 3 yr olds, especially with a highly sensitive temperament (which my niece has), it can be detrimental. They don't have the maturity to know that this is just a story and that it's not OK to behave the way Angelina does. Some girls really need to see positive examples of successful coping skills. Sadly, Angelina is the opposite: when her favorite dress gets dirty, it is ""ruined"" and she pitches a fit, and when she feels neglected after her little sister arrives, she decides to run away. Etc.

So I would not recommend this for sensitive girls, especially if they are younger than 6.",1392076800,,1063,4.5025906735751295

8047377,5,B0007GP74Q,"Angelina Ballerina is a favorite with us.  Was a bit disappointed that this was an older version with less costumes for Angelina, but the stories are great.  Would recommend it to Angelina lovers, but keep in mind she looks a bit different in these older versions.",1384560000,,264,4.717391304347826
8047378,5,B0007GP74Q,My granddaughter loves Angelina Ballerina and finds it fun to watch before going to her own dance class. Very cute show.,1379030400,,120,4.761904761904762
