8165806,1,B000M2DMTM,"This is a poorly-made and weak documentary. It's (old) footage is reused often, and some of it's historical sources are suspect. The graphical presentations are far from pretty, and one of the main interviewees appears to have no history qualifications.

The documentary also mistakenly assumes that ideology and warfare can be easily separated - that the Leibstandarte's numerous atrocities were unfortunate and relatively mysterious as to their cause. It fails to acknowledge that the Leibstandatre's killing of prisoners and civilians was consistent with national socialist ideology.

As Hitler's elite guard - selected for their ideological allegiance - they were the best motivated to carry out such acts. They were probably expected to kill prisoners and civilians by their own comrades even if their commanders did not give such an order.

Von Clausewitz called war 'politics by other means'. The Leibstandarte was arguably the purest military expression of nazi politics. In praising the qualities of the strong soldier, this documentary fails to appreciate that the Leibstandarte's strength arguably came from their genocidal fanaticism. It is a worrying flaw.",1466985600,,1169,5.593220338983051
8165807,5,B000M2DMTM,"This is a copy of the old Discovery Channel's ""Weapons Of War"" series that aired in the late 90's. For the money it is well worth it!",1330128000,,133,3.962962962962963
8165808,4,B000M2DMTM,"Thorough and informative documentary on the development of the Waffen SS Leibstandarte SS-Adolf Hitler division. However, this documentary is in DVD-R format...in other words, it's a burned copy, not a professionally pressed one...a pretty steep price for a such a cheaply produced DVD.",1184889600,19,286,5.674418604651163
8165809,5,B000M2DMTM,"This documentary starts with the creation of the Leibstandarte as a personal guard of Hitler and goes through its evolution to a full panzer division in the late years of the war. There are references to the personalities of the division (like the infamous commanders ""Sepp"" Dietrich, Kurt ""Panzer"" Meyer and Jochen Peiper), the battles it fought, the selection criteria, the bravery of its men but also the crimes committed by some of them in both the Eastern and the Western Fronts. There are many scenes that are really rare, although there are many others commonly seen before and a little bit repeated in this film.",1170115200,19,620,4.8584905660377355
