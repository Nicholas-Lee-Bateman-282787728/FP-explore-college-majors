8348607,2,B0020SC0XU,"This DVD started with war footage.  There was no attempt at the history of Korea (you hear about the 38th parallel, but no history behind it).  What was Korea like before the war?  I don't know.  I just know that the Commies came from the north, and the United Nations came from the South, and there was a war in Korea.  Disappointing.

The footage is mostly black-and-white.  The sound/narration is fine, but the veteran interviews are muffled.  There are rudimentary maps/diagrams...nothing helpful.

The narrator exaggerated several times, which led me to doubt other things he said.  For example, ""the soldiers fought for every step of ground"".  And while saying that, they showed a bunch of soldiers walking down a road.  They certainly weren't fighting for every step.

The narrator was professional, but the narration was not very informative.  Sometimes the narration did not match the footage.  Most of the time, the footage was random, short war clips strung together.  What was actually happening in the footage?  I don't know.  The narrator just kept telling the Korean War story...sometimes without regard to the footage itself.

I am still looking for a well-round documentary about the Korean War.  I had the same problem while looking for a decent documentary about the Vietnam War, but I eventually found this excellent documentary:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vietnam-A-Television-History/dp/B0001WTWOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vietnam - A Television History</a>.  Maybe there is something like it for the Korean War, but I haven't found it yet.

8348608,4,B0020SC0XU,"This set is a collection of installments of the old black and white TV show ""The Big Picture.""  They've been edited to remove the segments with the hosts of the show and it's just the combat footage.  Thankfully the original narration is on these discs.",1301011200,,253,4.6
8348609,4,B0020SC0XU,"This DVD set uses entirely contemporary footage to illustrate the Korean War and the back-and-forth nature of the fighting. This was the war, as explained to the people at home and featuring the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines who fought against the Chinese and North Koreans. Not in-depth, but definitely worth getting your hands on if you want to know more about this conflict.",1272585600,2,385,5.03125
