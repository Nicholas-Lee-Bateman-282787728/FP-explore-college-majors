8423176,5,B004CKNW7W,"This is one of the best yet. It was done in 2010, but the message is timeless.",1412467200,,78,3.6470588235294117
8423177,5,B004CKNW7W,Extremely encouraging and up lifting. Louie Giglio ministers to your heart and soul while delivering biblical truths. I recommend this.,1388880000,,135,5.8
8423178,1,B004CKNW7W,Because he started using man's word instead of God's!!! In order to obtain a copyright a bible must change the meaning of the words Two hundred times!!! KJV or man you choose.,1382486400,,175,4.5
8423179,5,B004CKNW7W,Louie Giglio is truly a great speaker. I would buy more of his video tapes. I find them very imformative.,1360972800,2,105,4.3
8423180,5,B004CKNW7W,A friend let us borrow a Louie Giglio DVD and we loved how he explains and teaches the word of God.  Louie Giglio has a way to capture your attention and gets the point of the lesson across to you in an understanding way.  Many preachers preach over your head....not Louie.,1360713600,2,273,4.333333333333333
8423181,5,B004CKNW7W,"I bought this and the Grace series recently and just wanted to tell you a couple of things before you buy this.  I wanted to give this as a gift so I bought one for myself to watch first to see how I felt it would be received.

The New Year dvd is two talks by Louie Giglio and is excellent, but if I had not watched the Passion series it would not have made sense nor had the impact it did on me.  The theme that builds through the 4 Passion videos continues on in these, so I'd suggest you first watch the 4 dvds of the Passion Series, either individually or buy the set,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Louie-Giglio-The-Heart-of-Passion/dp/B001R7IH5A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Louie Giglio: The Heart of Passion</a>, and watch them in order, then watch this New Year set.

If you want to buy a ""stand alone"" series that is also TERRIFIC, the Grace&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grace-The-One-and-Only/dp/B004CKNW7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grace [The One and Only</a>] series is very good for individuals or group studies and does not ""follow"" the Passion Series theme.

Hope that helps you.  We have a group who has already watched the Passion series, so we will be watching these New Year dvds together in January.  New Year is VERY powerful and inspiring once you have seen the first 4.  Great way to start the New Year!",1323907200,10,1417,5.351351351351352
8423182,5,B004CKNW7W,you got to see this it is a great follow-up of the passion talk series  great great great love all his stuff,1299110400,2,108,3.909090909090909
