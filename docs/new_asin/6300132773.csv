7803164,3,6300132773,"Des Cave stars as an irresponsible Irish playboy gigolo who hops from one affair to another. He finally discovers true love, but will not marry his steady lass after she becomes pregnant with a child that he is most likely the father of because he has already quit his job with an insurance company. The plot is very much like Alfie, even using a similar theme tune sung by Emily Lou Harris, except that hoodlums seem to be on every dark street corner, wedding, dream, and funeral waiting to beat Cave up. If director Haller of Roger Corman's American International Pictures had a volume tuner, the sex in the story would be turned down low and the pointless violence turned up high not unlike a typical film at the mall today. Also in the subplot is an angry sister who tells Cave's mom all his secret misdeeds, a sick brother who dies a sad death and Milo O'Shea is on hand with his thick bushy eyebrows from hundreds of film parts to play Cave's pub drinking buddy, Harry, who introduces him to bored middle-aged spinsters in search of a handsome lad and a good time.",1230422400,,1070,4.492307692307692
