8288976,5,B001CRD5SY,This episode truly captures the spirit of the what the 1970s Raiders were all about. Of all the America's Game episodes I have watched the 1976 Raiders was one of the best and I was not even a Raiders fan in the 70s.  The America's Game series is easily the most inspired series ever created by NFL Films.,1460246400,,305,4.258620689655173
