8672851,5,B00MK1RI16,"This is a very thorough examination of the theft of the Mona Lisa.  It's one of those films that I can watch repeatedly and never get tired of.  I've seen the Mona Lisa a number of times at the Louvre.  She may not be a real looker, especially by today's standards of beauty, but she sure did the Louvre a favor by getting stolen...Check ""Mona Lisa is Missing"" out...Certain you'll like it....Buy some copies for your friends too....they'll appreciate it!",1417564800,4,455,4.6625
