In this video you get the Road Warriors before they became a joke, and the Stieners...lets face it the Stieners ruled WCW back then. Also Doom, who people somehow forgot existed.  Its show classic bouts between these three and other respectable teams like the Freebirds and Rock and Roll Express.  This tape goes with the set of other titles like-Deadly Venom the best of Sting-Rick Rude Raw-New Blood on the Block-and my personnel favorite MEGABODYSLAMS, which is the best WCW  release of the time.
