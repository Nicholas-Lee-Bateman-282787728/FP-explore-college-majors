8597736,5,B00DTX7Y7W,I really love this series - so much wisdom and I feel I'm learning more about the Balanchine way.,1443916800,2,97,4.157894736842105
8597737,5,B00DTX7Y7W,"Great to have if you want to understand Balanchine's style.
This is Part 1 in their series on Barre work.
Detailed explanation of each step, what it's for and how to execute it properly aka Balanchine style by Ms Suki Schorer with occasional filler by Ms Merrill Ashley.
There were stories about what Balanchine made them do or comments he made in their student days which was interesting.
I'm so glad I bought it!",1420070400,4,414,4.608108108108108
8597738,5,B00DTX7Y7W,"I am a former ballet dancer and teacher (still), but not Balanchine trained. I did take a few classes from Balanchine-trained teachers, and saw NYCB many times, so I knew there was a difference in how Balanchine dancers were trained, but until I saw this DVD, I had no idea just HOW different and detailed the training was/is. This DVD begins with plies, and goes on to demonstrate tendus, glisses/degages, rond de jambe, pas de cheval, and other basic movements at the barre.(Interestingly, no relieves are demonstrated or even mentioned).  Suki Schorer is the ""teacher"" and former principal dancer Merrill Ashley and three other NYCB dancers of the time (not sure when this was filmed, but assume maybe 15 years ago?) are the ""students"". Ms. Schorer gives detailed explanations of the how and the why of each movement, very clearly and with good energy and images, and the dancers demonstrate repeatedly. Basic steps are done at different tempos and dynamics (faster and faster!). Some of the concepts I'd heard about Balanchine technique, such as the dancers ""not putting their heels down"", are clearly explained and demystified (and by the way, some do and some don't, depending on the length of their achilles tendon). The dancers demonstrate beautifully and with clear commitment to each movement. I now have a much better idea of how Balanchine used classroom work to lead directly to what we see onstage at NYCB. I've ordered The Barre, Part II, and can hardly wait! I highly recommend this, and undoubtedly others in this series.",1390003200,15,1538,4.98443579766537
