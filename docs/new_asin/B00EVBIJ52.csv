8609826,3,B00EVBIJ52,"I second every word of the lead reviewer Go for Baroque's very comprehensive and unbiased review.
The contents of this 75-minute documentary are apparently the result of a rather haphazard assembling of interviews (though they did chose big names like Jaroussky, Cencic, Fagioli, et al,, mostly countertenors).
My gut reaction is that this DVD is not a well-thought out documentary, but just a cut-and-paste assortment for the uninitiated (excuse me for borrowing this most accurate description) and curious. Some popular singers are included in excessively lengthy interviews seems to second this view.
I also agree whole-heartedly with Go for Baroque's very informed reminder of the omissions of eminent countertenors like Alfred Dellar (Nicolaus Harnoncourt would whole-heartedly agree here, I guess), and also Paul Esswood, and even Michael Chance, if not James Bowman.  On the American side, evidently Dr. Randall Kevin Wong's soprano countertenor singing cannot be ignored. If ever reference is required to be drawn in respect of Farinelli's singing, even Christophe Rousset's 1994 attempt to 'reproduce' Farinelli's sound in his film should at least be mentioned.
It is a pity that eminent exponents of the countertenor voices are not well represented in this video.  The terrific Andreas Scholl is not showcased sufficiently nor well represented.  David Daniels' singing is a convenient excerpt from a filmed live performance that happens to be on hand.
Some lead reviewers give very informative and highly interesting remarks, notably Max Emanuel Cencic and Philippe Jaroussky, both baroque scholars on top of eminent singers.
Among baroque conductors, It is a pity that only Fasolis is being interviewed.  William Christie's appearance would definitely upgrade the video's contents considerably.
In short, recommended for the curious but not for the aficionados.",1404000000,3,1872,5.604240282685512
8609827,3,B00EVBIJ52,"Heavenly Voices: The Legacy of Farinelli, at only 75 minutes long, cannot begin to be a comprehensive explanation of the historical phenomenon of male high-singing nor of castrati and what voices today best approximate their sound.  At best, the DVD can be an introduction to the subject for the uninitiated.  In some ways, limiting the program to just 75 minutes can be more difficult than producing at ten-hour series.  The producer must be highly selective in choosing what to include.

The strongest point of the DVD is the useful, interesting comments provided in many of the interviews.  The information imparted likely is more meaningful to singers and those familiar with castrato history, who can place that information into context.  The personal information given by singers generally is useful but occasionally diverges too far into personal history and unnecessarily takes up valuable time, especially in the case of Tomasino.

Mention should have been made of the fact that the Baroque passion for the castrato voice far exceeded the fact that women were forbade to sing in the Papal-controlled states, that the phenomenon extended to Russia, Sweden, Ireland, England, Germany, and even France, a country that supposedly disdained the practice.  A moment could have been taken to more clearly explain the extraordinary sound of opera-castrati, their unique timbre, technique, and singing ability, along with how that differs from the voices of boys, women, and men.  Such information is not conjecture; a combination of serious studies now provides us with better insight into that remarkable sound and would have emphasized the fact that singers today need more than the ability to sing high to best approximate the castrato sound and to do justice to the Baroque composers' intentions.  Simply quoting contemporary descriptions of Farinelli's voice would have been helpful.

Especially for a short video, the examples of countertenor singing tended to be repetitive and not varied enough.  Rather than several examples by the same singers, a few additional, carefully selected singers would have been useful.  Brief mention was made of Alfred Deller, important in his being one of the first countertenors to sing publicly outside the church; yet a moment of his singing was omitted.  The DVD did not give us a moment of Paul Esswood, a remarkable voice the viewers deserved to hear.  Dr. Randall K. Wong was unique in the 1990s because he sang soprano in operas such as Hasse's Cleofide, and a short recording  of that would have been useful.  The older clip of Janet Baker singing a male role was useful but also points out that the DVD could have had a few minutes of Deller, Esswood, and Wong.

A peculiar oversight was that the program left out the fact that, among the world's large population, there are a handful of males who are natural altos and sopranos and who possess  voices clearly different from countertenors.  There are recordings of Radu Marian, for example, singing arias and cantate.

Several aspects of the DVD indicate that the program was well intentioned but somewhat amateurish.  Closer writing and editing would have revealed the the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria was not by Schubert, as indicated.

Heavenly Voices is sufficiently interesting and informative for one viewing (although I watched carefully twice for this review); however, it is not one that I would be drawn to again and again or to share with friends.",1391212800,8,3453,5.137745974955277
