2907522,1,B000TME1AY,"This movie is 90 minutes you will certainly never get back. I can not agree more with Barbara Fisher ""Beyond Lame"". If you are considering spending your money on this movie, re-read ""Beyond Lame"" then put your credit card away! It is by far, the NUMBER 1 WORST ""Elvis"" movie I have seen to date. I would love to see comments from Lisa Marie on this one!",1196294400,,353,4.2835820895522385
2907523,1,B000TME1AY,"I should have checked to see who wrote and directed this amateurish pseudo-biopic before we rented it. D. Edward Stanley--otherwise known as David, Elvis' stepbrother, is the one who wrote and directed this turkey.

I hope he also ponied up the money to make it, because damn--I hate to think of anyone else losing cash on it. This film is self-aggrandizing in the extreme, and ridiculous. I mean, I knew it would be bad, but I was hoping it would be bad enough to be campy, but when I, a woman, can do a better Elvis impersonation than the actor playing Elvis--I knew we were in for trouble.

The writing was wretched. Apparently David Stanley doesn't know that personal pronouns exist, nor did he want anyone to forget that the movie was about HIM, not Elvis, because every time another character spoke to the main character, it was ""David, blah, blah, blah...."" to be followed by ""But, David, blah, blah blabbity blah.""

We took to counting the times that his name was said in the film, and gave up after twenty. It was too ridiculous. People simply DO NOT talk like that.

I won't mention the direction except to say it was utterly pathetic. Okay, I will have to add that the stunt coordination was amazingly horrible. The Kenpo Karate ""master"" is shown flailing around like a hooked fish being dragged to shore, and it was so embarrassing, I just wanted to scream, ""CUT!""

A first year film student could have done better. My advice for Mr. Stanley is to try a few semesters of film school, or maybe even just read some books on screenwriting. William Goldman's book is good, I hear.

Please don't rent this movie. It isn't bad enough to really be funny, it is just pathetic. And certainly don't buy it.",1193875200,20,1708,4.583606557377049
2907524,3,B000TME1AY,"Here is a Elvis bio movie unlike any others so far that I have seen.
  I have been an Elvis fan for more than 30 years and grew up in a household with a  brother who was a fan since the very early 60's.  I have been fasinated with with this mans life for a very long time, collecting his music, movies and approx 100 biographies.  What really made me a fan was to see him in concert towards the end of his life, (Oct 1976). At the time I was an 18 year old Kiss fan but at this concert he proved to me he was the King of Rock N Roll.
  Ok enough about me, this film produced, written and directed by Elvis'step-brother is not as bad as I thought it would be, yes it appears cheaply done and the directing is a little over the top, but the actors for the most part have done a pretty good job.
  The characters have almost all been renamed so it makes it a little game for the true Elvis fan to try to figure out who they really are suppose to be.  Even Elvis' name is never mentioned in the movie he is always called either ""Boss"" or ""The King"".  Darrell who is presumably Charlie Hodge has the least flattering portrayal.  Tom Sizemore portrays Ronny who I figured was Joe Esposito but in the directors commentary Stanley says he is Lamar Fike, but I believe he portrays Esposito, but maybe he is a composite of both.  Oddly Elvis' women are downplayed, not seen and barely mentioned.
  The soundtrack is the worst part of this film, no Elvis music is used, and no singing.  I don't like it when they make up songs to sound like Elvis music when it isn't.
  The story is interesting as I sayed before I am facinated with this guys life and a behind the scenes look from someone who was there is facinating.  It is common knowledge now that Elvis and his Image were not the same, Elvis had to deal with a lot in his life, from poor southern kid to the most famous entertainer in the world. When everyone tells you you are a King you are bound to start believing it and acting it.
  One other odd thing about this film is the end credits with a disclaimer stating "" All events and characters in this film are fictional any resembalance to actual persons is strictly coincedental"". But the DVD cover calls this movie ""A True Story"" You can't have it both ways.",1192838400,10,2258,4.180555555555555
2907525,1,B000TME1AY,"As a fan of Elvis Presley's for more than 20 years I have seen and heard a lot about Elvis Presley from people who knew him, claimed to know him, etc. Yes, David Stanley (using the name D. Edward Stanley to direct this garbage, probably doesn't want anyone to know it's garbage) was his step-brother, until Vernon divorced his mother in the early or mid-1970s, why didn't he mention Elvis by name? He also did no justice to Elvis, his memory or his legacy. Upon watching this ""movie"", and I use the term ""movie"" loosely I noticed, and at first, and wondered who ""Frank"", ""Jeff"" and, I believe, ""Darrell"" are that worked for Elvis. Then I realized it was Red West, his cousin Sonny West and Joe Esposito. Must have been some reason, legal or otherwise, that the names were changed. He (D. Edward Stanley) had Elvis portrayed improperly. The hair was too short, the sideburns weren't correct either, what about the weight gain Elvis went through during the last 5 years of his life. Also, his eyes were blue not brown. Thanks for making a rotten ""movie"" that does only you justice David. It should have been titled the ""David (D. Edward Stanley) Stanley Story"", it would have sold or rented fewer copies than it did. It went on about David this or David that more often than I can remember. It made him, the ""star"" of the ""movie"", David Stanley appear to be a jerk. The key word in my last sentence is appear, I do not know D. Edward Stanley and do not wish to pass judgement on him, just stating an opinion. What about the rest of the world that has plenty of Elvis fans, like me, that deserve to know what was really happening? I must say the only good scene in the ""movie"" came when Red West (given a different name here) punched David Stanley in the face. Too bad ""the Boss"" made him apologize for it. From the way it looked they (the ones called ""Jeff"" and ""Frank"") appear to hate, despise and basically want to beat the you-know-what out of David Stanley (D. Edward Stanley) for a good portion of the ""movie"". It's a shame they didn't, must have been afraid of what ""The Boss"" (I thought Bruce Springsteen was ""The Boss"" and Elvis ""The King"" or am I the only that notices this?) would do to them (fire them?). If all the people who knew Elvis from Scotty Moore and D.J. Fontana, through the musicians that played with him during the 1960s and 1970s and any family members and friends got together and tried to put out a movie all together, it probably would NEVER be made. The actors in this ""movie"" should never admit to it. The worst ""movie"" ever made about Elvis Presley in any way, shape or form. You'd be better off watching Elvis That's The Way It Is (this really is a movie!), at least it is more about Elvis and true to life at that point.
MY RECOMMENDATION AND IN MY OPINION: don't even rent this ""movie"" it's just a plain old piece of junk not worth the time. Too bad I can't get all my money back (tax included). Thank goodness FYE bought it and, as far as I know, can't sell it as a ""used"" dvd. Well, I lost $10.86 and about an hour and a half.",1192665600,14,3060,4.342059336823735
2907526,4,B000TME1AY,"If you are interested in hearing about the darker side of the life on one of America's best known icons; this is a great movie.

2907527,5,B000TME1AY,This movie was great!  It's a keeper that you can watch over and over again.  It's a TRUE story about the struggles of keeping the most famous person in the world at the time safe.  The director does a great job at portraying this from a different view than most Elvis movies.,1192233600,5,276,4.269230769230769
2907528,4,B000TME1AY,"Ok, an Oscar will no one win in this film, but the acting was not as bad as I have feared. The story is gripping and I found it interesting to watch behind the scenes of living with Elvis - especially on Tour. What is the truth and what is fiction is only known by the people who where there at the time. Now that I have watched this film - as many others from the so called Insiders - I can make up my own opinion how it was.",1192147200,4,426,3.7444444444444445

THERE ARE SOME SCENES THAT ARE SAD BUT I DIDNT CARE FOR THE GUY THAT PLAYED THE KING, FIRST OF ALL ELVIS DID NOT HAVE SHORT HAIR IN THE 70'S LIKE THIS GUY AND HIS ACTING WAS O.K.. IT SEEMS LIKE DAVID PUT IN MORE EFFORD TO GET SOMEONE THAT LOOKED LIKE HIMSELF THAN THE KING!!

2907531,3,B000TME1AY,"I love Elvis and almost anything about Elvis, books, movies....but this is one of the worst I have ever seen......a little sloppy in the story, the cast a little weak, and Peter Dobson one of the worst EP actors I have seen in a while......short type haircut, too short of sideburns.....I know it is supposed to be a story of David's life with EP, but its not that great a film.

I was given this film as a gift....one I would not buy myself......so in my opinion......blah blah blah",1403395200,,483,4.426966292134831
2907532,2,B000TME1AY,"This movie showed a bad side. Acting was horrible.. story line kind of was.... well boring. You have too take into account Elvis' bad habits as well as his good ones.. remember he was only human, but the movie lacked good actors and Tom Sizemore on his way out of doing good movies. Even maybe at the time, Tom Sizemore was dealing with addiction during filming.",1401235200,,362,4.5
2907533,4,B000TME1AY,"Not to be taken seriously, an account of life with Elvis on and off the road, that I'm sure is based on facts, but very exaggerated in my opinion. I will say it was very entertaining. I laughed through most of it, not taking it too seriously. I would suggest Elvis's fans do the same. Not for everyone, but i enjoyed it. There is some real merit to some of it... sadly....in truth!",1392508800,2,381,4.232876712328767
2907534,4,B000TME1AY,"Interesting film. I gotta say Matt Barr's body is crazy hot. Can't really decide what I liked more. Getting to see the dark side of Elvis portrayed by Dobson [when he ""supposedly"" places a hit on Mike Stone, Red and Sonny-different scenes] or just seeing Barr half naked yeah, Barr half naked. So for the ladies, it's good eye candy.",1390521600,,333,4.566666666666666
2907535,3,B000TME1AY,This was a pretty good movie.  The reason that I bought it and the part I like is in Larry Tatum's studio.  I would have liked to see Ed Parker Jr. playing Mr. Parker instead of watching.  I never knew Mr. Parker wore an earring. Lol.,1377561600,,234,4.043478260869565

2907539,1,B000TME1AY,"I recently rented PROTECTING THE KING from a public library, and as I watched it I was sad to reflect that many people besides myself would be viewing this trash film. Of course, writer and director D. Edward (David) Stanley was with Elvis Presley on tour and I was not, yet I have read a good deal about Elvis, and this movie does not jive well with what I have read. I think PROTECTING THE KING is at best a negative exaggeration of what happened, and at worst is outright fabrications.  Regardless of how true any of it is, the movie is a very unbalanced view because it is almost all bad stuff about Elvis's entourage and makes Elvis himself look pretty bad directly and indirectly, which I know is a distorted view of reality.

In case you didn't know, David Stanley is Elvis's step-brother, since Elvis's father Vernon married Dee Stanley after his first wife Gladys died. David Stanley is well known for making false allegations against Elvis, such as several years ago when he claimed that Elvis was a regular user of cocaine, a claim that was refuted by several other members of Elvis's entourage. At one point Stanley also claimed that Elvis committed suicide, a charge that also did not stand up under scrutiny. Why he says these things I don't know, but I believe that PROTECTING THE KING is more of the same false allegations and exaggerations.

Also, as many other reviewers have pointed out, the movie is NOT well written, directed, or acted. I also did not like that Elvis is never named in the film, but is always referred to as ""the King"" or ""the Boss,"" while the names of most others in the film are changed. Why was this done? I don't know all the legal aspects of this situation, but it seems to me that if the film were accurate, it would not have been necessary to omit or change names. Did Stanley fear being sued for making false allegations against people? Especially if you're an Elvis fan I would NOT recommend that you watch PROTECTING THE KING, since you'd probably be angered by it as I was. I mean, I like knowing the good and the bad about people, but I don't like seeing falsehoods and exaggerations such as this most likely is. I'd much rather see again the fine concert documentaries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-That-s-the-Way-It-Is-Special-Edition/dp/B000053V7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis - That's the Way It Is (Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;and also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elvis-on-Tour/dp/B003HKN52A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elvis on Tour</a>.",1342310400,4,2592,5.196172248803828

8210199,3,B000TME1AY,The son of the woman that married Vernon Presley is taken on tour in 1972 to learn the ways of the world and eventually becomes the youngest bodyguard in rock & roll. Use of medication and guns occur. He returns home and gets married then goes back out on the road for activities in a series of hotel rooms. Devolves into a 'Scarface'-type existence. This is supposedly the truth. Unflattering portrait. 'The King's' name is never actually mentioned so it does not appear that this is officially approved. A bit of a lumbering thing. Swearing.
