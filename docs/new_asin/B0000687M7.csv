I have also ordered the other Cedarmont Kids Sing Along Songs and my daughter-in-law purchased the dvd set so they can also listen to the songs at home.",1412467200,,278,4.365384615384615
7963875,5,B0000687M7,"We received this as a gift.  I'd never heard of the Cedarmont Kids, but from my daughter's response, we're going to be purchasing many, many more.  My daughter LOVES this video... it's her favorite by FAR.  So much so that we wore out the tape and now I'm buying another one.  She stands in front of the TV and boggies to the music, and to my surprise at only 16 months of age can already do the ""eensy weensy spider"" hand motions, just from watching this video!  Highly recommended for any toddler.",1102809600,,499,4.380434782608695
7963876,5,B0000687M7,"It may drive you a little crazy, but these are all the songs that toddlers love to sing.  The skits and presentations (complete with hand motions!) for each song are easy to watch, and the music is full and rich. Especially watch for ""there's a hole in my bucket"" and ""the wheels on the bus"".  This tape will keep you humming all day.",1037664000,4,334,4.285714285714286
