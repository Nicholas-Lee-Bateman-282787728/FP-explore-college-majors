3704577,2,B000IR512C,"It's a mystery why more attention hasn't been paid to ""Deadline USA"".  Humphrey Bogart is the crusading editor of a big city newspaper that's about to be purchased by a competitor and effectively put out of business.  In the meantime, Bogie fights to expose a big time racketeer (Martin Gabel)  as responsible for the murder of a former girl friend who stole $200,000 from him.  In any case, as great as a movie this is--the video transfer is very disappointing-- not too much better than VCR quality.

This film was originally a 20th Century Fox release and it is baffling why this film isn't released domestically from their library.  This DVD in question is an Italian release, but is all regions.  Just the same, they could have spent more time on the video quality.",1366416000,3,770,4.701492537313433
8322829,5,B000IR512C,"As you know, August is officially Cornell Woolrich Appreciation Month. Cornell Woolrich, who sometimes styled himself as William Irish, was one prolific crime novelist. Reportedly, more film noir screenplays were adapted from his stories than from any other mystery writer. Hitchcock's Rear Window and Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black are only two of the more prominent for instances, classic thrillers that originally sprung from Woolrich's typewriter. But on to a somewhat less prestigious endeavor: a modest RKO noir whodunit from 1946: Deadline at Dawn.

Bill Williams lands another one of his patented wide-eyed, straight shooter roles. He plays Alex Winkler, a young sailor on leave in New York who runs afoul of a no-good dame and her mean-eyed brother. (""Her brother, he's got a face like the back of a hairbrush."") Alex is plied with liquor and falls in a fugue, a blackout that spans one hour. It's not until sometime later that Alex finds he's got $1400 on him. It ain't his loot. As this addled swabby is won't to declare, ""Non compos mentis.""

Who killed that drunken floozy Edna Bartelli? What we're made privy to is that, prior to her windpipe getting crushed, an old flame, the blind ivory tickler Sleepy Parsons, dropped by for the money she owed him. The sum? $1400.

Sun is down, but there's no escape from the sweltering heat. In the morning Petty Officer 2nd Class Alex Winkler has got to take the six o'clock bus and report to the naval station in Norfolk, Virginia. He's got a good soul. Alex goes back to the shady dame's apartment to return the money. He finds her corpse.

A few hours before, Alex may have given in to temptation, may have spent some of that $1400 on things like bananas (to help out a tired banana vendor) and on a roll of dance tickets at a packed taxi dance hall. The comely taxi dancer he'd set eyes on initially had given him the brush off, except he wore her down, I guess, with his charming guilelessness. The girl is 23-year-old June Goff (Susan Hayward), no innocent, she. But June had a brother who was a belly gunner in the war. Maybe it's why she elected to stand by Alex when the fit hit the shan, never mind that whenever things got hairy, that was her cue to recite her ominous catchphrase of doom, ""I hear the whistle blowing.""

Deadline at Dawn is a dilly of a noir picture. It adeptly conveys all the noirish elements. The many moving pieces play out their prescribed parts, navigating an atmosphere thick with dread and despair, with panic and paranoia, and, gradually, with a drowning sense of fatalism. The sailor and the taxi dancer are soon joined by a kindly cabby whose name is Gus (Paul Lukas). Night owls scurrying along the mean streets and playing at amateur sleuths. Except it's tricky work to clear a baffled sailor whose sole defense is ""Non compos mentis.""

I wasn't too impressed with their gumshoe efforts. Seemed to me, most of what they did consisted of grabbing at straws, making staggering leaps of deduction, and lucking into clues. But they stumble across enough clues to keep the pace nicely hopping.

Film noir likes to play the occasional ghoulish gag. It's darkly amusing that the dead dame's apartment happens to sit right across the street from an unwitting police precinct. Shame that, except for one scene, the film doesn't take advantage of this potential set-up for close call scenarios.

I love movies that take place during the dark wee hours. Premise like this, I always imagine Edward Hopper's painting, Nighthawks, coming to life and sparking that chilling frisson of detachment and isolation. In the dead of night, deep shadows in play, the streets, empty but for a few lost souls, seem bleak and desolated, and errant noises produce startling echoes.

The dialogue zips along, a blend of mean street tough talking and a Runyonesque twist. It's a juxtaposing that shouldn't work but does. I dug it, anyway. To me, the highlight character is Gus, New York's most philosophical cabbie. His musings, his delivery of them, are wonderfully baroque and endlessly entertaining. Some of his hits:

- ""The divine being made many loathsome creatures, but none so low as a woman with a cold heart.""

- ""Speech was given to man to hide his thoughts.""

- ""The city's full of men like that, nerves and worry, living on cigars and bicarbonate of soda, wrung out by sleepless nights.""

Maybe my favorite line is what he says when he starts grilling the dead dame's mean-eyed brother: ""We'll start with some gas station courtesy."" I dunno why, but that sounds dope.

Or maybe the best line is when the mean-eyed brother inadvertently eulogizes his dead sister: ""She was no lullaby but she had the brains like a man.""

Many moving parts, and plenty of them acted well. Paul Lukas as the expressive cabbie is world-weary yet kind-eyed. Joseph Calleia as the dead dame's vicious sibling is like you're trapped in a tiny room and there's a viper in there with you. Susan Hayward, sexy and hard-edged and been around the block some yet surprisingly hopeful and sweet, plays counter to the femme fatale presence of Lola Lane's despicable Edna Bartelli.

Deadline at Dawn instantly reminded me of Two O'Clock Courage (1945), the point of similarity being that a beleaguered amnesiac is abetted by a helpful cabbie. Thing is, Two O'Clock Courage is more a lighthearted Thin Man mystery. Deadline at Dawn is a heavier brooder and more cynical and fatalistic. Maybe you'll sympathize with the killer who harbored hopes of getting away with it but, then, as events unspooled in the inexorable way that they do, finally caved in to an uncaring fate. During the killer's confession: ""Oh, anything can happen in this heat, and it happened."" That's noir.

Happy Cornell Woolrich Appreciation Month, everybody.",1502409600,,5776,4.824064711830132
