8692085,5,B00QMWEISU,"Between 1999 and 2000 I recorded every single episode of both the animated Jumanji and Godzilla: The Series when they aired on Cheez TV. I was a fan of both movies that spawned these respective animations and quite enjoyed them. While Godzilla was a continuation of the movie source material, Jumanji was more of a reboot that borrowed heavily from the movie. Both were set in Brantford, both featured the same design for Alan's house and the Jumanji board game itself, both featured the same characters and the premise of Alan being trapped in the jungle, but the continuity is completely different. Whereas in the film Alan was suck in Jumanji until a player rolled a five or eight, in this continuity all players are given a Game Clue and then sucked into the jungle until they solve it, in Alan's case he didn't read the rules and subsequently never read his clue. Throughout the series, Judy and Peter go into Jumanji to try and help Alan find his clue, and in doing so learn some valuable lessons along the way which help them to become better persons. For example, the second episode makes heavy use of Judy's trait from the movie of being a pathological liar, but by the end of the episode she sees the error of her ways and vows never to lie again.

That is the basic overall premise of the series. Although the animation could be a little better and some episodes seem a little childish, the series is by all means an entertaining watch. After all the horrors that were released on the real world in the film, it's quite an interesting experience to take a trip into Jumanji itself and see where said horrors came from. Whereas in the film, some new vicious animal or killer plant was released into the real world at the role of the dice; here with the characters actually trapped in Jumanji itself with all these fierce creatures and thus it is impossible to know what will pop up next. One minute they may be chased by lions, the next they might be getting shot at by Van Pelt. The possibilities are seemingly endless.

Long have I waited for this series to be released on DVD. My only criticism of the DVD itself is that it contains all THIRTEEN episodes of Season 1 on one disk. That's nearly FIVE hours of footage. I'm not sure what transferring methods were used, but watching the DVD I noticed some slight mosquito noise occasionally. Mill Creek Entertainment might have improved the quality by spanning the seasons over two disks instead of one. By comparison, their four disk DVD set of ""Godzilla: The Series"" had only ten episodes per disk, and I don't remember seeing any compression artifacts. Still, this is only a minor criticism, as the overall picture quality is heads and tails vastly superior to that of my home recorded VHS to DVD transfers.

All that said, I'm glad that the series is finally getting a DVD release. I just hope that Mill Creek Entertainment releases the remaining two seasons on DVD. With no DVD releases of the second and third seasons, my DVD to VHS transfers are the only complete set of this series that I have... and one of my season 3 recordings had a severe blackout for the first ten minutes. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, MILL CREEK ENTERTAINMENT! PLEASE RELEASE THE NEXT TWO SEASONS ON DVD!",1430006400,,3241,4.603806228373703
8692086,5,B00QMWEISU,"When this first aired back in the 90's I remember being originally put off my the character designs. And it would take 10-15 seconds every week to get used to it.

This cover brings that back. The character design looks daunting. One might wonder what craziness they will get into

But the crazy character design really allows the animators to tell awesome stories in a jungle world where anything can happen. The Manji tribe are little more than fearsome tribal masks with arms and legs. They are super expressive and shift back and forth between being allies and adversaries to Alan and the kids. The first episode does a bit of the ""remember this from the movie"" thing, but the rest of the series is all new. If we are lucky enough to get seasons 2 and 3, rest assured that unlike many open ended cartoon series, this show did get a final episode and Alan does not remain trapped in Jumanji forever.

Bonnie Hunt's character did not make the series, but Robin William's Alan is here voiced by Bill Fagerbakke from Coach, How I Met Your Mother, Gargoyles, Roughnecks, Batman Beyond and Sponge Bob Squarepants. The boy Peter Shepherd says ""cool beans"" a lot and is voiced by Ashley Johnson who played the daughter in the movie What Women Want, did a few episodes of Wil Weaton's Tabletop and voiced Ben 10's Gwen.

Van Pelt is back in this, but he is not alone. Tim Curry voices J.H. ""Trader"" Slick and William Sanderson (Hi I am Larry and this is brother Daryl and my other brother Daryl"") voices Professor J.S. Ibsen who also cause no end of trouble for Alan and the kids.

Unlike cartoons made by Hanna Barbera, Filmation, DiC, or even later Sony cartoons, Jumanji stands alone as the only cartoon with this style and feel.

I really hope we are lucky enough to see seasons 2 and 3 released on DVD.",1425254400,,1802,4.529230769230769

8692088,5,B00QMWEISU,"I actually purchased this on the ""grey market"" long before it was released, so the particulars are for the show itself, not the actual DVD.

Originally put off by the animation style, I refused to watch it during its original broadcast back in 1996.  I threw it onto an order from a DVD ""collector"" years later, because I thought it looked interesting.  It became one of my favorites.

Based on the movie of the same name, Jumanji follows the adventures of two children Judy and Peter (a bit younger than in the movie, but with better coping skills) who originally found the magical board game.  By rolling the dice and reading a magical clue, the two get sucked into the bizarre world of Jumanji, where they must solve the clue (with the help of Alan Parrish, a bearded man who has lived in Jumanji since he was transported there as a child who played the game and forgot his clue) in order to return home to their Aunt Nora's attic.

Fraught with danger, the world of Jumanji seems likely to be the children's end or permanent home in each episode.  Their perils are compounded by villains like Van Pelt, the ruthless hunter who seeks the heads of animal and human alike to mount on his wall; Trader Slick, the devious scamming merchant of Jumanji; Professor Ibsen, the quirky mad scientist and Master Builder of Jumanji; and the Manji Tribe (led by Tribal Bob), a tribe that have actually become their tribal masks.

With voices of celebrities like Bill Fagerbakke (Dauber from ""Coach""), Ashley Johnson (Chrissy from ""Growing Pains""), Debi Derryberry (known for ""Ben 10"" and ""Teen Titans,"" Tim Curry, Phil Lamar, William Sanderson (Larry from ""Newhart""), Ed Asner, Dabney Coleman, and Eileen Brennan, this really is a great series.  The animation isn't the cheap Japanese style that many of today's cartoons employ, even if it appears so from the cover.  The style grew on me, and most viewers will surely learn to love it as I now do.

The full series has 3 seasons and 40 half-hour (22-minute) episodes.",1423612800,2,2008,4.724928366762177
