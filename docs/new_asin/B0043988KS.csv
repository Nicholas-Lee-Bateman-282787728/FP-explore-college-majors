4254151,5,B0043988KS,"This was a gamble as I knew nothing about this movie, but at a very good price, it panned out exceedingly well.  I don't generally read (or write): reviews because I want to appreciate the movie without having some idiot reviewer exposing the plot or other elements that I prefer to experience on my own.  Here, I found this movie to be a noteworthy effort, and I enjoyed it thoroughly.  It's a great 'ninja'(?) romantic action packed story that caught and held my attention from start to finish.",1333843200,,496,4.613636363636363
4254152,4,B0043988KS,"I recently saw this film and I think it is a WONDERFUL ADAPTATION of one of my favorite Manga series: KAMUI,THE ISLAND OF SUGARU as it is known here in the USA.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Kamui-Perfect-Collection-Vol-1/dp/1569313180/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Kamui: Perfect Collection, Vol. 1</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-Of-Kamui-Volume-2-Perfect-Collection/dp/1569313237/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend Of Kamui, Volume 2: Perfect Collection</a>&nbsp;Basically, it is the story of a fugitive ninja who finds himself on a tiny island\province in medieval Japan. In this village he encounters a fisherman who himself is wanted for chopping off the ivory-colored leg of the feudal lord's horse so he could use it to make a fishing lure! If that's not enough, the fisherman's beautiful wife is an old enemy of Kamui's who thinks he has come to spy on her! It's a story about how Kamui tries to find peace living with a small family as they struggle to find freedom and love during a time when the choices were absolute obedience or death...

The title of my review comes from a line in the graphic novel, the full meaning of which I will keep to myself lest I spoil the endings of either the movie or the books. I thought S.Miranda and Zack Davisson wrote excellent reviews and my reason for chiming in was to assure readers of the Manga that it was a well-done adaptation; conversely, those who enjoy the movie may want to check out the original source material! You can't lose either way!",1326758400,,1620,5.694214876033058
4254153,5,B0043988KS,"""KAMUI: Gaiden"" is a beautifully shot and well produced Ninja film. The scenery and picture clarity was amazing. Highly action packed with mind-blowing fight scenes and with Kenichi Matsuyama in the lead role, I know one day this movie will be considered a Japanese Classic. After seeing this film, I have no doubt there is a possibility of bringing a ""live Naruto"" movie to the screen.",1315612800,,386,4.863636363636363
4254154,2,B0043988KS,"I didn't expect wire work in a Japanese ninja flick, but it's in this one.  If you enjoy that sort of thing, you'll probably like this.  I don't and I didn't.  I'll be glad when Japanese directors stop throwing After Effects at every scene and get back to making entertaining movies.",1305936000,,283,4.509803921568627

Which was the only good part, was when he cut off both the other guys arms off in a duel. Bit still a very very very bad move, they were trying to make a million dollar movie on a 100 dollar budget. So in the end you get what you pay for",1301270400,3,334,3.527027027027027
4254156,3,B0043988KS,I wish I could tell you this movie rocked but I can't. It had some neat aspects to it and certain scenes but overall I walked away disappointed. I don't like to give away too many details and spoil it for others but the main story of the movie is a ninja that has left his duties as a ninja and the law is that if someone leaves being a ninja they are hunted down and killed. I would suggest you pass and find a better movie.,1296950400,,425,3.896551724137931
4254157,4,B0043988KS,"From its very beginning, the story of the renegade ninja Kamui has been political.  Created in 1967 by leftest-artist Sanpei Shirato, Kamui was a symbol of Japan's rigid social classes and rules, and the woes that befall those who try to rage against the machine.  Sanpei used Kamui to tell tales of discrimination, oppression and the exploitation of workers. Since the characters first appearance in Garo magazine, Kamui has been adapted into anime and continuing manga series, but this 2009 movie is I believe the first Kamui live-action film.

 Directed by Yoichi Sai (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quill/dp/B000N47PAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quill</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blood-And-Bones/dp/B001EKGW1Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blood And Bones</a>), ""Kamui Gaiden"" (translating as something along the lines of ""A Supplemental Biography of Kamui,"" to distinguish it from Sanpei's original ""Kamui Den""), this version of the Kamui story retains the political nature of the character while thrusting him into an action-packed ninja spectacular.  In this film, Kamui is not only an outcast ninja but a member of the hinin-caste.  Hinin, which translates as non-human, were the Japanese equivalent of the Indian Untouchables, a caste so low that they had no legal rights or dignity.  Discrimination against the hinin caste continues even today, known by the term burakumin.

From birth, Kamui (Matsuyama Kenichi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Note/dp/B0017SVH5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Note</a>) faces horrendous abuse and discrimination, like all of his caste, and his experiences causes him to harden and dedicate himself to becoming strong.  He is adopted into the Iga ninja clan, where as a young boy he takes part in the assassination of Sugaru (Koyuki,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai/dp/B0001JXOVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai</a>), a woman seeking to escape the clan.  It is one of their rules; no one leaves the shinobi. Years later, now a ninja of some strength himself, Kamui finds the hunter/prey role reversed as it is Kamui who flees the shinobi and is pursued.  He fights and fights, and eventually finds some sort of shelter with a fishing village on an island far from the known cities.  There he meets a man Hanbei (Kobayashi Kaoru,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Princess-Mononoke/dp/B00003CXBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Princess Mononoke</a>), who offers him a life of peace and the hand of his daughter in marriage  However for a man like Kamui there can be no peace, as Hanbei's wife is none other than Sugaru, still alive, and both Sugaru and Kamui find that there is nowhere they can run from their troubles.

As befits the character, ""Kamui Gaiden"" is a pretty dense story. Those looking for some light ninja action might find themselves with a little more plot than they bargained for.  You can enjoy the film without the political background of the hinin and Japan's Edo period caste-system, but some of the finer points might be lost, as well as some of the motivation of the characters.  Especially at the beginning, when a young Kamui rages against the children who pelt him with rocks asking ""What is so different about me?"" and in classic Shakespeare style shots ""Prick me, will I not bleed?""

But the film does a good job of lightening its heavy moments with some over-the-top ninja wire-fighting.  Sadly, this is something Japan has just never done as well as China, and the fight-scenes are never really more than decent.  This is the first CGI-heavy film that Yoichi has done, and that is his weakness.  In his films like ""Quill"" and ""Blood and Bones,"" he has shown he can do intense human drama, but he is not really an action director.  There is a particular rubbery shark in one scene that ruined my suspension of disbelief.

Funimations release of ""Kamui Gaiden"" is superb, with other 45 minutes worth of extra features including a ""Making of"" and ""Behind the scenes.""",1294876800,33,4180,5.829228243021347
4254158,5,B0043988KS,"I enjoyed this film quite alot, i liked the action scenes despite the some what corny cgi. the action scenes are something i had to suspend
my desbelief but did not take away my enjoyment from the film after all he is a Ninja. The majority of the action
 is in the beginning of the film and the end of the film.
The story revolves  KAMUI a ninja constantly being hunted for leaving his clan, struggling to find a place to call home where he is safe.
Through a series of events he is taken in by a small fishing village, where he might finally find what he is looking for.
I enjoyed this story as well though there are some slow points in it and can be a little bit confusing half way through the film at first
*SPOILER* (pay very close attention to the old man who likes to paint.) then you will have a better understanding of whats going on.

To some it up i really Ilked it,
 if your skeptical of the cgi and the plot i recommend renting it. but if that does not bother you and your a fan
of Japanese films like me, I say buy it its worth it.

Thank You for reading i hope it's helpful.",1294790400,33,1088,4.0418604651162795
4254159,5,B0043988KS,Kamui Gaiden is a quite an enjoyable film if look past at the cheesy CGI effects and a farfetched story. Kamui Gaiden is loosely based of the popular manga series in Japan and developed a anime series in the late 60's. It's starts off slow but gradually picks up to explain some of the characters' motives. Or you looking for a movie to blow off the weekend then this movie for you.,1294531200,10,382,4.319444444444445

4254167,3,B0043988KS,"Though the setting is beautiful, the acting is pretty good and the story in solid and interesting, the distracting CG ruins it when I watch. Things become too unrealistic and just come across as silly. Some of the fighting action is really awesome, but when they resort to CG it gets really awful. The shark section is just macho silliness. In this day and age, I can not forgive bad CG.",1391817600,,387,4.464788732394366
4254168,1,B0043988KS,"This movie is just plain horrible.  The story jumps around all over the place, maybe even more than the ninjas, and then the lines are beyond cheesy most of the time.  The movie just seems to suddenly end with little closure.  Usually that would piss me off, but I was so happy that the movie was over that I could care less.

Of course all that could have been forgiven if the fight scenes were amazing.  Sadly the fights are just as bad as everything else.  The special effects they used are terrible and the choreography isn't that good either.  After every fight I felt very underwhelmed.

Save the money and purchase something else.",1381017600,,637,4.526315789473684

4254177,3,B0043988KS,"Good movie but the big difference is that the main character is not Ainu like he was in the anime. The Ainu are the native people of Japan. The movie has some good although highly impossible and unrealistic CGI fight scenes in it imagine ""Crouching Tiger"" but with rogue Ninjas. The movie does not really follow the anime that much at all except for the tragedy aspects of innocents (women and children) being killed. I don't believe this movie could ever hope to be as sad as the anime was it was one of the most depressing animes of all time.

This movie is good but not nearly as good as ""Goemon"" or ""Casshern"" which are other live action animes. ""Space Battleship Yamato"" is another live action anime that is quite good. What will the Japanese come up with next? A live action Ninja Scroll or Curse of the Undead Yoma?",1343865600,,822,4.443708609271523

The fight scenes were good, but here you have this incredible and pretty unbeatable warrior remaining silent and quiet the majority of the film. His only emotion shown at the death of his sort of  of true love, but not really (you'll figure it out). I hated the concept of the world being a crappy place with no good in it at all. If I wanted that in a movie I would not watch the movie, but the news. I don't need to be reminded of how horrible the world is, cruel and unforgiving, but this movie seem to just brag about misery. all the good and decent people die, mostly get killed, and the bad guys mostly win only to be followed by more misery if they make a sequel (or maybe they already have). I disliked the poor use of CGI (if that is what you wanted to call it). The effects were good, but the story never went anywhere. The Fisherman father was the best character in the whole film. The bad guys played horribly bad and the good guys played the bad guys. Not a good film a great disappointment.",1434499200,,1086,4.221153846153846
