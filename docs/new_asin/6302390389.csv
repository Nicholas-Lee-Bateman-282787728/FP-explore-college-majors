7825016,5,6302390389,"Bronco, another classic Warner Bros western series, featured Ty Hardin as a ex-confederate army officer, and his often violent encounters with notorious outlaws. In this episode, Bronco Layne crosses paths with Jesse  James, played by James Coburn, who would soon get his big acting break in  ""The Magnificent Seven"". Also featuring Jeanne Cooper as the  legendary outlawess Belle Star, and Richard Coogan as Cole Younger. Pretty  violent, and bloodthirsty, this one, for its time. Definitely parental  guidance, but not to be missed by lovers of westerns from the golden age of  TV. Nicely packaged, crisp black and white print, and perfect Dolby-B  sound.",961977600,20,657,5.320388349514563
