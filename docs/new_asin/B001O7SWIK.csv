8329949,5,B001O7SWIK,"Ikkou is an average teenager. He is sent to a Buddhist temple to train under his Grandmother to become a priest. It's a lot more difficult than one might think. Ridding himself of his earthly desires will be nearly impossible with 6 pretty girls also training there with him. It's definitely not all bad though. Ikkou is able to awaken his tremendous spiritual powers when he sees a little bit of priestess you know what. When a rival sect sends a cute priestess to awaken his power through earthly desires, it's gonna cause a major problem.

This is a classic harem anime in the tradition of Tenchi and Love Hina. It's really fun. It's rated 13 and up. There are a lot of risque girl shots, but the graphic stuff is mild. It's only got moderate objectionable content I would say. Not like that stuff bothers me anyway. Ikkou is a little less appealing of a character than Tenchi or some of the other harem anime heroes, but he's a bit more realistic. He doesn't act indifferent or unassuming like some of those other anime guys we are used to. It's nice to see a character that actually gets worked up over seeing a naked chick or has a little bit a perverted side at least. It's easier to relate to guys like that. All the female characters are fun too, as well as pretty. As far as the production goes it's pretty good. I like the character designs and bright colors. The soundtrack and voice acting aren't bad either. This series is a whole lot of fun. I'm glad I bought it.",1352246400,,1478,4.413919413919414
