430451,5,6302150930,"Thomas Hardy is one of my favorite authors, and I have this film adaptation of ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" to thank for it. I first saw it on cable - my sister told me not to bother with it because it was a long bore. I was curious and decided to give it a try anyway. Well, the film captivated me completely, and I found myself watching it over and over each time it aired. Filled with beautiful, haunting imagery, wonderful acting and cinematography, Hardy's tragic story came alive in Polanski's hands, and I was so swept up in Tess' sad tale that it stayed with me for years. I finally read the book as a college student, and was a amazed how faithful the director had kept to the text. I am sad this film is out of stock, as I have not seen it recently, yet still remember it vividly! I also recommend ""Jude"" with Kate Winslet and ""Far From the Madding Crowd"" with Julie Christie for fans of Hardy!",988243200,6,903,4.255813953488372
430452,2,6302150930,"If you have read Thomas Hardy's novel, you will understand that Tess's rape by Alec d'Urbervilles at the beginning of the novel is the lynchpin the  rest of the novel hinges on. Tess was revolted by this man, was overcome by him, left immediately, and bore his child, who subsequently died.
Everything after that--her shame, her angst about revealing her past to Angel, and most especially her murderous act--stems from this first act of brutality.
This particular adaptation shows Tess merely finally succumbing to the attentions of Alec d'Urbervilles, staying on 4 months with him, and then whimsically deciding to leave. Hardly motive for the rest of the story's development, and I'll debate this with anybody until the cows come home.
Watch it for the fine filmmaking, for Kinkski's beauty, but for heaven's sake, if you are doing a book report, DO NOT base your report on this film. At least read the first third of the book, and get a feel for how Tess's innocence was violated. The rest of the story will feel much much more profound and tragic, which it was certainly meant to be.
And while I'm at it, here's a tidbit to throw in (for you book report researchers). Has ""blaming the victim"" really changed all that much since Hardy's time?",983923200,9,1246,4.768518518518518
430453,5,6302150930,"I write as someone with an English ancestry going back three centuries and a passionate love for Hardy's novels and poetry. I live within five miles of Dorset and have visited practically all the towns and villages mentioned  by Hardy using his Wessex aliases. I was prepared to scoff at Tess - Polish  director on the run from US police, a German girl in the title role, French  locations and finance...even a mock Stonehenge. I was wrong, hopelessly  wrong. Today I remain in total thrall to this movie, Roman Polanski and  Nastassja Kinski. I believe it is an artistic masterpiece just as important  in its own way as an Old Master painting or a Shakespearean sonnet. Tess  has enriched my life, and, having it watched it at least 50 times, provides  an enduring source of pleasure to me. Yes, there are moments that jar -  Nastassja's occasionally-heard Teutonic accent as in ""Let me see that  ledder (letter)"" and, in one hilarious moment, even balalaika music -  but I can forgive them without the slightest hesitation. I know the area in  which Hardy set Tess, and, astonishingly - as he filmed it in Normandy -  Polanski has managed to recreate some Dorset settings with almost mystical  skill. Marnhull, or Hardy's Marlot, for example, has a real-life church on  a hill that can be seen for miles - so does the village as seen in the  film. Was it accidental, or just another example of Polanski's passion for  detail and authenticity for which he is justly renowned? Unfortunately,  Nastassja has made some real lemons since Tess and sadly she may never turn  in another performance of such outstanding brilliance. Or will she? Hardy's  remaining works may give her that chance. How would she fare, for example,  as Bathsheba in Far From the Madding Crowd? If you want my opinion,  divinely.",948240000,98,1801,4.779220779220779
430454,5,6302150930,"Tess is unlike any other movie made by Roan Polanski you are likely to come across: it is a sweeping, beautiful and deeply felt epic.  Nastassia Kinski, accent completely forgivable, is stunning in this movie, and it  makes sense that this was her springboard to notoriety.  Hardy's story  becomes a feast for the eyes and ears in this version of the compelling  story, what with its spectacular location photography and romantic musical  score by Sarde.  For those of you who love big, old-fashioned epic  romances, with more than a little touch of melancholy, you will love this  movie.",945907200,15,588,4.918367346938775

430669,4,6302150930,"Good attempt to follow the book line. Not totally satisfying because (in my opinion) lead actress (N K) looks appropriate but lacked something for this role,",1488844800,,157,5.076923076923077
430670,5,6302150930,"What's in a name? Well to farmer John Durbeyfield it means everything and when a local church parson tells him that he might be related to the aristocratic family named ""d'Urberville"" it sets in motion a series of events involving his eldest daughter Tess that has all the elements of a tragic Shakespearean play. But it's not Shakespeare. ""Tess of the d'Urbervilles""(published in 1891) is one of the many novels written by author Thomas Hardy that explores class distinctions in Victorian England where young women were brought up to marry into wealth and family name meant everything. If you were a strong willed peasant girl the odds of achieving such a life were dim if not impossible. In 1979, director Roman Polanski brought Hardy's masterwork to the screen in a sensitive and intelligent film adaptation that ranks as one of his best films. Criterion has now brought ""Tess"" to Blu-ray for the first time and the results are simply astonishing. According to the liner notes from the enclosed booklet: ""This digital transfer was created in 4K resolution from the 35mm original camera negative"" which makes for a pristine picture from start to finish(Bitrate: 18.66). Using French countryside locations in place of Hardy's semi-fictional region of Wessex, colors just pop off the screen. Greens, yellows, blues and reds are vivid and look exceptional on Blu-ray. The Oscar winning cinematography by the Geoffrey Unsworth and Ghislain Cloquel is a marvel to behold with every scene looking like a painting(Sadly, Unsworth died during the production and did not live to see his final work). The period costumes by Anthony Powell(also Oscar winning) are very impressive and colorful with even the smallest details being highlighted, especially the red dress worn by Tess during the film's climax. The Audio(DTS-HD MA 5.1) is another delight with the sounds of the countryside(threshing machines, horse carts, etc.) adding to the flavor of the story. The acting is top notch held together by an absolutely incredible performance by Nastassia Kinski. Only 17 at the time of filming, Kinski's beautiful features are on full display and it's obvious from the first scene that she and the camera were meant for each other. Her instinctive approach to her role as Tess Durbeyfield is one of the best performances on film. ""Tess"" is 171 minutes(Aspect ratio: 2.39:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include: (1) A 1979 French television episode about the shooting of the film(49 min.); (2) A documentary about the making of ""Tess"" (53 min.);  (3) A 1979 British television interview with director Roman Polanski; (4) Three short documentaries of the making of ""Tess"" and the Original Theatrical Trailer. There is an informative booklet by Professor Colin MacCabe that is also included. This Blu-ray package  is a Criterion ""Dual Format"" edition that includes both the Blu-ray & the DVD.(Please note that Criterion has since released a ""stand alone"" Blu-ray of ""Tess"" that comes in a standard clear transparent case for those who just want the Blu-ray). ""Tess"" is another outstanding Blu-ray presentation by Criterion and one of their best releases. It comes very highly recommended.",1488240000,7,3216,5.194605009633912

430747,5,6302150930,"I bought the Criterion 2-Disc version, which has been 4k Digitally Remastered.

Of the 3 adaptations of Thomas Hardy's Tess, this version from Roman Polanski is the best - it excels in invoking the atmosphere of the era.

Having read the book, both the 2008 BBC adaptation and this have strong points. BBC's version certainly includes more detail from the novel (the horse dying being central to Tess's visit to the d'Urberville's in the first place, and which Polanski lops off for speedy development), but it misses in providing you with the guileless innocence and virtue of the main character. Certainly there is nothing lost by the way Polanski has percipiently made these edits. The imagery captured by Polanski also brings the late 2nd Industrial Age to vivid detail, both in the visuals as well the audio: With his usual assiduity, Polanski provides key sound effect and ambient noises that give key scenes much higher emotional weight. When d'Urberville visits Tess on the starve-acre farm, Polanski chooses to maintain the loud, overbearing whine of the steam thresher in the background, which adds to the stress of the scene.

Where this version really, really excels is capturing the tenderness and bitterness in great consonance with the novel, set against scenery that brings to life the way the same are described by Hardy. The dairy scenes are captured so well you never want them to end, and the winter work scenes tear your heart out. The evident attention to detail for the sake strict adaption is when Clare carries the girls across the flooded road; Polanski has given Peter Firth the same cabbage leaf under his hat as noted in the book (ostensibly to help him stay cool in that hot Wessex summer). It's the details like this that make this version as powerful as it is.

Characters are also much closer to their novelized counterparts. Kinski is not only believable as Tess brings the pity of her role to life with ease; you can equally believe she is inexperienced, lonely, hard working, innocent, virtuous, and lost during the character's development. A big plus also goes to the casting of Leigh Lawson; while he's too old for the role as described in the book, he steps into the lecherous, supercilious outline Hardy created for the character with complete ease. I'm still out on Peter Firth; I think he's the best Angel Clare, certainly in the manner of false piety.

If there is one downside to this otherwise excellent adaption, it the cold ending. BBC's adaption with Arterton and Redmayne handles this part correctly, and it that version important for this reason. Polanski chose not to give Tess the final courtesy of showing her beloved husband walk away with her beloved sister. This ending is indeed much more bitter, and while it's not out of place I'm not generally fond of summary titles over final scenes.",1478044800,,2845,4.881987577639752

430755,3,6302150930,"There are much better adaptations out there of this classic story by Thomas Hardy, from his book Tess of the D'urbervilles. This version, from director Roman Polanski, misses the main theme and point of the tale, and reveals Polanski's twisted personal character. He was well-known in the 1970s as a bit of a pervert; continuously and inappropriately interested in very young girls (12-16), he reportedly slept with Kinski. He was very much married - a few times -... and is also infamous as the husband of model/wannabe actress Sharon Tate, who was a victim of the Charles Manson gang. His behavior with adolescent girls caught up to him when he photographed topless and seduced a young girl in Los Angeles. He was arrested and ultimately deported, and banned from the U.S. - something which he fought for decades. In the end he was reviled for being a paedophile and pitied for the way Tate was butchered, while many months pregnant and Polanski out of the country. While abroad, he made ""Tess"".  This film is visually quite beautiful, as is much of his work. Kinski can't act her way out of a paper bag, or she couldn't at that age, but she was beautiful and mesmerizing. Now, all that aside, THIS is the issue: the original story is about a RAPE. Tess is raped, holds onto the (justified) anger over the assault, and her hate and anger leads to the tragic ending of the plot, which I won't give away here. Suffice it to say that without the viewer's understanding that the rape did her great psychological damage, the plot falls apart. Polanski - perhaps insensitive to the layers of meaning in the rape of a young girl - portrays the sexual assault as a mere seduction gone wrong - kind of a ""well she didn't REALLY say no so..."" moment.  It's really offensive, when you know what the story really is. Would I recommend it?  Perhaps... it's never dull and is beautiful to look at, sort of like Kinski herself.  But there is no substance, and no fidelity to one of the English language's great works of literature. Hardy would have been aghast at how far from the point of the story Polanski was.",1472256000,4,2100,4.606951871657754

430867,5,6302150930,"The story of TESS is universal, of course, but Polanski sets her story in as painful but okay...then hopeful with a plan and then she's off determined to make things better.  She's willing to work her butt off under all kind of circumstances.  Her baby dies very young and the priest tells her he understands her rituals for her child and GOD does too.  She feels so much better about life and things and of course ''the things'' are the rules and regulations others make life to be.  The priest lets her know he understands the rituals she has done for her child but her child cannot be buried in the church's sacred graveyard that belongs to the church's righteous people and their kin: the child has to be buried somewhere else... not on sacred ground.  WHY?  The child was not born sacred (according to the rules and regulations) and was not baptized except for the baptism that Tess gave her child.  So Tess shows her determination to own a piece of life and glory.  In the night she buried her child in the holy ground.  BRAVO TESS. (Polanski is so, so detailed.  You get drawn into the story and the performances.  You are there with Tess.  You feel Tess.)
  HE just had to have Tess.  She was worn and tired and hungry.  HE took advantage of that like he took advantaged of Tess when her family was hungry before.  THAT'S WHEN WE THE AUDIENCE GET STUCK IN THE MIDDLE.  We know what would have happened if she had left with the man she loved when he finally came to get her.  We know HE was going to hunt her down relentlessly.  She didn't want HIM but she'd be starving without him.  He made things easier for her and her family.  She realized that....BUT  She made a brash and determined decision to end the blight in her life.  Did she plan it?  We are left to decide that but it doesn't appear that she would or did.  THEN...IT WAS DONE'.  And Tess had to be punished.  (My soul cries.)  The whole story is a woman's story, about punishing a woman, about punishing Tess for wrongs that other people orchestrate for their own reasons.  TESS is a  movie to watch many times.

However, Polansky left out a very small line delivered by Tess to the man she murdered right before killing him which might have preserved her 'purity'.  (The subtitle of this book was originally ""A Pure Woman."")  By leaving out that line, Tess appears more sinning than sinned against, which is not the case.  Other than that bit, the movie follows the book quite closely.  Not being a typical Polansky film, I read a little about its making and learned  that his wife Sharon Tate had asked him to make a movie of ""Tess"" after she had read it.  This was one of her last wishes, unfortunately.",1440633600,,631,4.63063063063063
431014,4,6302150930,"No question, Thomas Hardy, the old 19th century pro-the sun never sets on the British Empire devotee and despite the killing off of the flower of British youth in the slaughter the fervent partisan of British entry in World War I had a feel for the literary pulse of the rural back country of England in the late 19th century well after it had become the premier industrial capitalist power in the world. In such master works of the genre as The Mayor Of Casterbridge, Jude The Obscure and the novel from which this Roman Polanski 1979 film adaptation, Tess, was taken Tess of the DUrbervilles Hardy painted a sober picture of the lives of those who were becoming marginalized in the great movement toward industrialization and urbanization. Painted too in the heyday of the Gothic Victorian novel the many intricate relationships, romantic or otherwise, which reflected the fading ethos of a long past period of idyllic rural life (as opposed to the squalor of urban life with its cramped spaces, its stinking swill and garbage, its devilish diversions and its acceleration of what the old 17th century English philosopher Thomas Hobbes called a short, nasty, brutish life).

Of course the virtue of modern cinematography, of modern film is to take an essentially dreary and monotonous rural backdrop to the story of the downfall of the last strand of the DUrberville family tree, especially of Tess and to make what Hardy described in words come alive in scene like the opening one with the Saturday after work in the fields dance with the young village girls in their finery and their wedded bliss desires, the scene of rural work like milking cows and threshing hay and the like. Tess, played by the then drop-dead beautiful Nastassja Kinski (maybe now too although I have not heard anything about her lately) who was so photogenic that for Chrissakes even when she was down on her luck as a rum-dum field hand threshing hay every guy in the audience who had a pulse, maybe a few gals too, wanted to take her away from such drudgery never mind every neer-do-well guy on screen who did a double-take as she seemingly walked her way across England bags in hand. And in the process told  us about the perfidy of men, the idiocy of rural life, British version as Karl Marx once said, and the wicked ways of the world that a beautiful if nave young country girl faced as she tried to make her way in a world where name, position and class mattered (and still do).

Here is how beautiful Tesss downfall played out and you can judge for yourself the temptations that befell her. The sturdy yeoman farmer, well maybe not so sturdy, John DUrberville found out that he was the descendent of a great family tree (we will use that DUrberville moniker here anyway although he used an Anglicized version). In order to profit from that lineage link-up he sent Tess out into the world of the rural gentry looking for help from more fortunate members of the family tree (mistakenly looking for members as it turned out since the great lines had long since given up the ghost).

Mistake number one for Tess was to wind up with a cousin Alex (played by Leigh Lawson) who was nothing but a cad and who deflowered the then innocent Tess. Innocent but nevertheless the one who had to pay for old Alexs wicked ways since she became pregnant by him and bore a child who died soon after birth.

Mistake number two, and I do believe it was a mistake on her part after Alexs churlish ways and after she tried to start anew by working in the dairy business was to fall head over heels in love with the younger son of a parson, Angel (played by Peter Firth). Fell in love but nevertheless got married to him without as it turned out telling him about Alex and the baby before the marriage. Angel turned out to be a proper parsons son and refused to forgive her that youthful indiscretion and thereafter left for parts unknown leaving Tess stranded to fall on her own resources (and grit). Until it was too late. Mistake number three for Tess (after giving up the hope of any reconciliation with Angel) was going back with Alex who turned out to be not only a persuasive cad but a classic bore of an English gentleman.

Naturally the chastised Angel showed up to express his love and his sorrow but it was too late. Well at one level it was too late since Tess tried to send him away but then she murdered Alex and ran away with Angel. Obviously even boring caddish English have a right not to be murdered and so after a short reunion tryst the coppers catch up with the doomed couple. And the doomed Tess, doomed by her innocence, doomed by her upbringing and class position, hell, doomed by her utter beauty wound up being hung by that pretty little neck of hers.

431063,5,6302150930,"The movie is 5 Stars and the presentation is 4.75.

Many times the lives of the Cinema great directors are not the exemplary one that should accompany their work. Roman Polanski along Woody Allen, Elia Kazan, and many others, have done things in their personal dealings not as illuminating and commendable as the ones they achieved in their movie work. Aside from this, no one may fail to agree that Tess is a magnificent film: one of those rare movies where story, casting, imagery, artistic direction, music and directing conjure up to bring a wonderful and indelible experience.

Based upon the Thomas Hardy novel -and rather faithful to it by the way, the story centers around the character of Tess, a strong, extremely beautiful but nave young woman, who ends up being the victim of men (The one who desires her and the one that loves her) and finally of the society and conventions of the Victorian England in the last half of the nineteen century. Hardy was a pessimistic at heart, and he believed that the happiness was around the corner. not the next corner but the one we have just left behind forever; in fact at the very beginning of the movie Tess (Nastassja Kinski) meets Angel (Peter Firth) the man who is going to be the love of her life, but he just passes her by. All this happens some time before Alec (Leigh Lawson) her supposedly relative seduces (rape?) her, ruining her status and her life.

This movie is full of marvelous sequences as the one in which Angel carries Tess in his arms over a water pound on the road, confessing with their looks their mutual love affection, or the one when she painfully discovers that the letter that she has wrote long ago -telling Angel about her past, was never read by him.  This movie touches many corners: love, desire, nobility presumption, social conventions, betrayal, redemption.  This is a film that has aged very well, in part for the way it was carried out: lot of filming on location (Normandy in France passes for England Dorsey), natural lightning, no-makeup makeup, natural acting, etc.), and for the fact that is a straightforward story splendidly and beautifully  told. The photography in particular of this film is outstanding, capturing in the exterior country and rural shots the view and mood of several master painters of the era and also the hypnotic, extraordinary, almost unreal beauty of Nastassja Kinski aged eighteen year old by the moment of the filming.

Criterion, as usual with them, provides a spotless video image (4k restoration made in France in 2012) and a strong 5.1 DTS-Master HD audio which particularly favors the remarkable score written by Philippe Sarde. The Bluray comes with a DVD copy of the movie (divided in two discs) and a zillion of extras -some newer some contemporary to the time of filming, that help to show the different facets of the movie conception, production and legacy, and also to show that Polanski as director was/is very exacting with his actors and production team. The only sour note is, as always with Criterion releases, that the only subtitles provided are English; Criterion should learn that the movies in which they spent so much care to prepare for releasing, are of universal interest, and that providing captions in other languages opens the door for many foreigner viewers to enjoy jewels such the present one (Here comes the quarter-point deduction)

By the way, this presentation of Tess shall be great for a gift, because the movie (all 3 discs) comes inside an outstanding box with a booklet full of beautiful pictures from the movie, highlighting that painterly quality, I mentioned before, that the movie has.",1434758400,2,3653,4.852327447833066

So confusing and had me wondering who the movie was going to be about. I don't have a problem with establishing shots of course, but when you give these peripheral characters up to ten minutes of screen time and one to five lines of dialogue it makes the audience think the movie is going to be about them. There are long scenes of absolutely nothing happening. I get the desire to shoot vast open landscapes. But come on people, shoot them and move on.

And after Alec takes advantage of Tess she NEVER TOLD HER FAMILY ABOUT IT SO THEY COULD SICK THE LAW ON HIM? WHAT THE HECK??? It was never even made clear if she told them who the father of the baby was--and they just accepted her having an illegitimate child like it was the most ORDINARY THING OF THE DAY???

Nastassja Kinski just stands around with this blank, dead pan look on her face and says her lines in a slimy incoherent slur as if she couldn't wait to get off the set.

Seeing this movie was three hours long, I asked myself after forty minutes ""Do I really want to put myself through this any longer?""

But I was so young and impressionable back then with so little life experience of my own. Now I see things through wiser eyes that have been through so much more.

I bought the movie because I'm a huge Polanski fan, and so Id thought I would give this movie a try even though I had some low expectations about seeing the film to begin with. I can honestly say it is like watching a soap opera in the respects the movements and the dialogue by the actors are of the type. If you like Downtown Abby than you would really enjoy this film, otherwise you might feel restless watching it. The worst part of the movie was the sound as I couldn't hear about 98% of what they were saying. The dolby stereo sound they recorded in is absolutely horrible. I have a home theatre system and when I crank it up all the way I still can't hear what the actors are saying.

If you enjoy movies (like Days of Heaven) filmed during the magic hour, this is the one to watch.

431483,5,6302150930,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT.

First to draw attention is the sublime packaging of the Criterion Collection's release of Roman Polanski's TESS: in particular the haunting visage on the box cover of Tess as portrayed by Nastassja Kinski.  This face can magnetically cross store aisles and hypnotically pull one towards it.  Who is this mysterious woman named Tess?  She is lovely, a living work of art - but she is not smiling, not happy.  No.  In the masterful screen-grab used to perfect poetic effect for this cover, Tess looks mostly...lost.  She looks at whomever looks at her with past darkness over her left shoulder and nothing but fog before her when she must eventually turn her head and face her uncertain future. Her look is more resigned than expectant, more doubtful than certain, much more lost than ever having been found.  If the essence of a film may be captured in one image, this is that image for the tale of Tess.

Very few movies truly attain the peak of perfection in all of their elements: story, acting, photography, music, costuming, set design and so forth.  Kubrick attained it with his period piece, BARRY LYNDON, in 1975.  And here, in Polanski's possible reply to Kubrick's challenge, we have another period piece that is an unmitigated masterpiece with nary a false note in the entire cinematic symphony that this film undoubtedly is.

TESS was made in 1979 before the crippling temptations of CGI came to distract and ""direct"" directors.  The land in this film is real - the sky is the true thing - you can almost inhale the fragrance of everything from grassy lawns to rainy nights to barn stalls - and the trees, you can almost feel the shade of them.  The rooms are all there as well!  Not half real and the rest cyberly painted in post-green screen.  In the extremely interesting extras herein one will see how arduous Art and the attainment of its perfection truly can be. The several extras explore the making of this film quite extensively and always interestingly. And listening to Polanski talk film is like listening to a Renaissance master discuss his paints and canvas.

Some have criticized the acting of Ms. Kinski in the titular role.  Some say she is one-note, lacking in emotional range.  But those who think this are missing the point, at least with regards to her performance in this film.  Tess, through the vagaries of fate, finds herself facing death before she has truly had the time to ever live a life all her own.  Tess is putty molded in the minds of men.  She is what the men in her life think her to be, not what she is or could be.  Even when she finds herself a murderer, she becomes one in a daze - and kills because some bit of her knows on some level that throughout her short years she has been killed, over and over again.  That is why - when the police come to arrest her - she is ready.  People who are truly alive are never really ready to die.  But Tess, who never grew to be more than a beautiful woman in the eyes of men who could never see or care to see the stirrings of a soul within, has never been truly alive, truly alive to herself most of all.  So Ms. Kinski's vacant, vapid performance is pitch perfect - and it conveys the utter ambiguity and loneliness of a spirit stunted by its vacillating surroundings and circumstances.

It may be cliched to say they don't make movies like this any more.  Nonetheless, it is mostly very true.  So if you haven't yet met Tess, don't let this pass by.  And if you are looking for a movie that has been as artfully and carefully composed and created as a Leonardo da Vinci masterwork, cross the aisle to the haunting face and pick up an authentic crown jewel of cinema.",1396828800,14,3681,4.531818181818182

The contrast in the BFI is too bright for me and Criterion has got this film looking awesome (even more brilliant on a 2160p display)! The blacks are nice and dark and the contrast doesn't blow out the whites. Could not ask for a lovelier picture. This is the original 172 theatrical cut and not the longer print of 186 minutes. Not sure if the 186 minute version is in circulation, but this cut works fine for me. This is Roman Polanski at his greatest. The soundtrack is also just as stunning in lossless DTS-HD 5.1 (the BFI version is flat Dolby Digital). The special features are awesome as well. It includes many interviews and talk shows with the director and other production members (and these aren't short by any means). The film and special features appear on one blu ray. The DVDs are split onto two discs (sorry did not view DVDs so I am not aware of the quality). The only thing missing is the brilliant director on a commentary track. I would love to listen to him talk about film making (more than what's allowed on the special features). He has great passion for the art.

It is a wonderful transfer,it looks beautiful. The film itself is a tale that could not be told better. Of all the work Polanski has done,this is his finest film(though I am a big fan of Repulsion). There is a moment just over 16 minutes in where Tess is walking through trees that sent me back to seeing it in the theater-just a glorious shot. Nastassja Kinski is beautiful,and her acting is just the right tempo to fit the story. Understated,yet something is brewing underneath.

Well, NOW I Have ""her"", and I watched her tonight on my Region Free Australian Import DVD, and once AGAIN.......

I was transported back to when I first saw Roman Polanski's Very Faithful, and Majestic, Interpretation of Thomas Hardy's Novel of ""Tess of the d'Ubervilles""; which is a particular Favorite of mine of all of Thomas Hardy's Novels, and most of them have ALL been made into theatrical films, ( ""Jude"" from Thomas Hardy's ""Jude, the Obscure"", ""The Mayor of Castor Bridge"", ""The Return of the Native"", etc...) and if not Full-Blown Theatricals, then they ALWAYS get the ""Masterpiece Theater Treatment"" which is something that I Very Much relish as well. ) And, this one did too, I might add.

At any rate, Roman Polanski's ""Tess' is so visually striking, and sumptuous, it is breath-taking! He does EXACTLY what a truly great director should do with literary masterpieces, stay true to the book, and let the adaptation of the book, and the cinematography, and of course, the actors and actresses do their very best work. Stay on the Target of the faithful Book Adaptation, but focus on the story-telling, let the Story unwind with all the power of the visuals, and the power of the interpretation of the Director, and that of the Actors/ Actresses, and let them do their best to remain faithful to the Book as well.

Roman Polanski manages, once again, to pull this delicate balance off with spectacular success! Thomas Hardy would be very Proud of this cinematic Masterpiece of his beautifully-wrought Tragedy; and it is, and at the end of this very long, but very essential part of the story-telling, ( it is a long movie, at 165 minutes ) but it is necessary to give the film it's ""head"" to lead to it's very sad, but very real, end.

It deserves it's 5-star Rating, and ""Tess"" won three Academy Awards, in 1979, for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, and Best Costume Design, and it's sad that the Very Young, Nastassja Kinski, didn't win for Best Actress that year. Obviously, I Very Highly Recommend this Movie, it's a Must-see! ( and a ""Must Get"", too! IMHO )

431665,5,6302150930,"Director Roman Polanski illuminates Thomas Hardy's novel of the poor but spiritual and beautiful English country girl Tess, a role inhabited by a young and striking Natasia Kinski.  Those acquainted with Hardy's novels and biography are aware of his identification with a certain class of the 19th  century rural English poor--those of ""the old families"" that had (as his own family) descended from the Norman nobility that participated in the Norman Conquest.  The discovery by Tess' father that they were remnants of the once great and aristocratic Norman d'Urberville family sets Tess's life on what proves to be a tragic trajectory.  In her travels she associates herself with a wealthy family that she wrongly believes to be distant relations, only to find herself sexually harassed and pregnant by a young rake of that same clan.  Now a fallen woman, Tess finds that her way in the world is made painfully difficult--with even the seemingly wonderful and Christian man she eventually marries turning her away once he learns of her unfortunate past.",1337472000,,1054,5.140350877192983

It first came out for public purchase in VCR, two parts. The VCR was better.  Having to jump up to change the cassette wasn't.

Roman Polanski did an incredible job visually.  From the opening scene of the fields to the end scene with Tess walking ahead of a police officer on horseback, every scene has a visual beauty to it.  A truly remarkable skill with his camera. He especially captured the complexities of the characters extremely well, in my view.  Tess isn't such a victim, even though we taut her as a victim.  She is passionate.  She has a strange sense of loyalty to unwritten social rules yet there is a sort of free spirit side to her personality.  D'urberville isn't such a cad and Angel isn't such a righteous man.  Angel came from a clerical family and was ready to prove that the trappings of religion could be cast aside without fear of loosing one's moral pinning. Angel, in righteous indignation, casts Tess aside and D'urberville is ready to make things right with her.

431668,4,6302150930,"If I had viewed this beautifully filmed version of TESS without knowing who the director was, never in my wildest dreams would I have guessed it was Roman Polanski! It is very different from his other films. Of course Polanski is a versitile director. Anyone who could go from THE TENANT to FEARLESS VAMPIRE KILLERS (a masterpiece of the comedy-horror genre) has got to be multifaceted artistically. Reading the negative reviews of TESS confirmed the opinion that many Amazon reviewers react more emotionally than rationally. TESS is totally UNLIKE any other Polanski production.

It's more BBC's Masterpiece Theatre than ROSEMARY'S BABY.

Nastassia Kinski is, of course, physically beautiful, but it is her ""inner self"" that captivates in the film. Her Tess is so completely understated--and this is where other reviewers may have a problem with this production--as to be ephemeral. Despite her beauty there is an illusive quality to the characterization. She's more spirit than flesh & blood. It's as if Tess advances through life with the forgone (perhaps, subconcious) conclusion of being ultimately doomed. This is so close to Thomas Hardy's vision of fate, that I'm surprised most negative reviewers either missed it or just didn't want to see because they had a pre-existing bias against Polanski. This isn't the place to go into RP's legal woes; suffice it to say that he was more set-up than predatory.

I thought the script still needed some work in showing motivation. I agree with reviwers who felt details of Tess' relationship are too truncated. For example, the whole ""baby thing"" happens so fast, it's almost like Tess never had a baby. However, this may be part of Polanski's intent on not wanting the audience to wallow in wet, 3 hanky emotion--a feature that overall I appreciated. He didn't want to create a melodrama bloated with nudity & sex scenes.

In ways--some obvious, some not so obvious--TESS reminded me of ELIVRA MADIGAN, another impressionistic style film about a compellingly strange & doomed heroine.

Here's a little heretical hint: The TESS I screened was a 1 Disk Director's Cut version available from Netflix--and, despite being passed around like a village hussy, it was in a spotlessly pristine condition with outstanding cinematography & exhibited none of the problems some reviewers complained about. It would be nice if there was more consistency in the film reproduction industry.",1308441600,5,2424,5.173469387755102

Polanski is arguably one the the greatest living directors, and already had a resume of critically acclaimed work (Rosemary's Baby, Repulsion, The Tenant, Chinatown) by 1979. Tess represented a departure from his usual rather spare cinematic style and the arty psychological horror genre  - it's a dreamy sumptuous feast for the eyes.  The landscapes he creates are almost surreal in their beauty.  And Nasstasja Kinski in the lead role is well cast - she just oozes innocent sensuality and seduces the camera.  Yes, she was not even legal when filming began, and yes, she became sexually involved with the much older Polanski during filming, but lets put all that and other Polanski scandals aside for now. It was a different time - those kinds of affairs were not nearly as taboo.  Remember Woody Allen's Manhattan? This movie, and we film lovers, deserve a high-quality DVD or blu-ray transfer of this masterpiece.  C. Porter's 2004 review of the poor SE DVD transfer has made me decide not to purchase it.

She makes us feel alternately Tess's coldness and her attempts to melt, her desperate grabbing at love only to shun it, her inability to choose between the two men in her life, and her final realization that her true happiness does not lie on earth.  The movie does not only show Tess's inability to find happiness, but that she causes torment to the two men who love her. Each character is complex and human, not stereotyped and caricatured as it sometimes seemed in the book. The film's musical score is haunting and truly suits the mood of the story.

One interesting change the film makes is that, after Tess's father declares he doesn't want his children going begging, Tess is immediately shown on her way to the D'Urberville estate. In the book, she only goes after she kills the family horse, depriving them of income. Tess in the film is thus even more independent than in the book - this shows throughout the film.",1231977600,,1160,4.6536585365853655
431714,5,6302150930,"Roman Polanski's film Tess, (1979) adaptation of Thomas Hardy famous novel of the 19th century ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"", won many prestigious awards, including three Oscars of six nominations and every award for Best Cinematography it was nominated for. If any film deserves recognition for its beautiful, lyrical, sensual yet melancholic and poetic visual presentation, ""Tess"" is it. The movie might be Roman Polanski's finest achievement, and this statement comes from a viewer who is in love with  all Polanski's films starting with his debut ""Knife in the Water"". ""Tess"" is one of the best adaptations of the classic novel I've seen and it lives, breathes and moves freely. It never rushes to tell its long story but tells it with rare finesse, compassion, and love for the heroine, a gentle creature who had been insulted, humiliated, and ultimately destroyed.

The success of the movie starts with the choice of the actress for the title role. Tess as played by 20 years old Nasstassia Kisnki is beautiful, sensual, shy and full of life and hope for love. The life of Tess unfolds in front of us from her teenage years as an innocent country girl until the powerfully tragic final scene at the magnificent Stonehenge. The film is almost three hours long but I never was bored, on the contrary, I felt compassion for the girl and anger toward the men that used and corrupted her, ruined her hopes for love and happiness, and toward the society that mercifully discarded of her. Tess is one of the best movies I've seen. It is stunning, subtle, emotional, tragic, and unforgettable.",1228867200,4,1589,4.903345724907063
431715,4,6302150930,"While taking artistic liberties from the novel , Polanski's Tess is a very entertaining and beautifully filmed movie. The settings and costuming recreate the feeling of Hardy's Wessex as well as any filmed version of his works ever has.

Nastassja Kinski was beautiful in the role and although her acting can be somewhat wooden at times she does make a memorable Tess. The rest of the cast make up for her shortcoming by providing outstanding performances.

The pace tends to slow in certain parts of the film but if you are a fan of period films loosely based on classics you can do worse than spending some time watching this.",1180224000,,628,4.7
431716,4,6302150930,"I didn't read the novel so I have no comments about the accuracy of the adaptation.  I had no problem understanding it.  (Some reviewers said that it was necessary to read the book in order to follow the film.)  I had no problem, either with the length.  In fact I was glad it was so long; I wanted to get ""the whole story"" not a compressed version.

The photography, as others have mentioned is exquisite.  It's worth seeing again, with the sound off, just to see the gorgeous country shots.

The music was perfect too--just right for the mood of the film--not too intrusive.

Nastassja Kinski was perfect as Tess.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role.  All of the other principle actors were just right and gave excellent performances.  How we loved the divine Angel until his rejection of Tess on their wedding night!

The whole film is gorgeously earnest and deeply felt.  The only reason I subtracted one star is that the story is just so damned depressing!  Knowing what we do of Polanski's life, one can see how he'd be attracted to such material, but for me...I would have preferred some happiness and joy for poor Tess.",1177977600,3,1137,4.592039800995025
431717,5,6302150930,"I like to think of the novel's premise as genealogy really going to someone's head.  When John Durbeyfield is informed by the town historian that his family used to be a noble one (and the original name was ""D'Urberville""), he sends his daughter Tess (Teresa) to rich relatives in the English countryside for financial help.  It's there that she meets with Alec D'Urberville, effectively beginning a downward spiral for everyone concerned.

As always, one can trust a book adaptation in Roman Polanski's more than capable hands.  He faithfully adapted Ira Levin's ""Rosemary's Baby"" in 1968 and Roland Topor's ""The Tenant"" in 1976 before tackling Thomas Hardy's 1891 novel ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles"" in 1979.

It's common knowledge that Roman adapted the book to honor Sharon Tate's memory (it was reportedly the last book she read.  She put a copy on his night-table with a note suggesting that it would make a good movie).  The continuous personal attacks on him are really unnecessary (and, f.y.i., they make the attacker look really dumb ... especially when their missive is a grammatical masterpiece).

For having just learned English during preparation for her role in the title part, Natassja Kinski managed very well.  She conveyed the vulnerable and melancholy Tess appropriately.  At times during the course of the movie, one can almost feel themselves being sucked into Tess's depressing vortex, snapping out of it with her ... only to fall right back in again.

Leigh Lawson played a right-on Alec D'Urberville.  He was the monster I envisioned Alec to be while reading Hardy's novel.  Peter Firth as Angel was also excellent in his role.  Roman nailed the English countryside dialect and he always does a fantastic job with Victorian England scenery (he repeated that success with 2005's ""Oliver Twist"").

Roman did an excellent job, as always, with ""Tess of the D'Urbervilles.""  The book could be adapted a thousand times after his version and they still couldn't match up to his vision.  Roman took Thomas Hardy's always depressing vision and turned it into a beautiful movie (for further proof of Hardy's depressive novels, check out his final book, ""Jude the Obscure"").

The DVD and Book collection series was a great idea to try to get people to read the classics alongside the movie.

""Tess"" is a must-have for the DVD collection.  - Donna Di Giacomo",1169596800,4,2369,5.0256410256410255
431718,3,6302150930,"Columbia's DVD of Tess is doubly disappointing - not only is it a disappointing transfer but it's also the cut version of the film, which tends to lose a little heart and more than a little irony. There's still much to admire, from the beautiful Scope cinematography and Phillipe Sarde's superb score to Polanski's feel for time and place (even if it is shot in France rather than Wessex) and, ironically, sexual prejudice, although Nastassja Kinski never really convinces in the lead and Leigh Lawson's despoiling cad seems constantly on the verge of twirling his moustache. The murder still seems a plot contrivance, although it does throw in one great moment of vintage Polanski with a spot of blood on the ceiling.

Still, at least the 72-minute documentary is very good.",1166227200,,775,4.916030534351145
431719,5,6302150930,"Every once in awhile a film comes along that it should only be spoken of in hushed tones.  Roman Polanski's  TESS is one of those films.  To place it in context, there are moments in the film DR.ZIVAGO that are some of the most beautiful on film... they are a stark relief to the majority, which is snow covered and bleak.  , Being set in lush countryside, 80% of TESS is that gorgeous, making it one of the most visually beautiful films ever made.  It won Geoffrey Unsworth & Ghislain Cloquet 1981's Best Cinematography Oscar.  (Unsworth died of a heart attack  way through production.)  It also rightfully won for Art Direction and Costume Design.

 Like DR.Z., this film tells the story of the downfall of a lower class girl who has neither the schooling or upbringing to fight for herself, in Hardy's unrelenting sad story (written after he had become depressed in the wake of reading Darwin, and saw the dying way of life that industrialization was bringing about).

  Natassja Kinski is luminous and looks a bit like Sharon Tate, and reminiscent of young Ingrid Berman here, in look, but also very much in persona and even her voice.  Now wonder it has been hard for her to follow this film.  Few roles could match it, few productions have gelled this completely.  Peter Firth as her misguidedly moral husband is perfectly matched with her, and they both give richly felt performances.

 The musical score is soaring and melancholy, the costumes are just right, whether they be the muddy field workers or the finery of a fallen woman, and the shades of class within different farms are delineated here, too, in costumes and set, and the golden days of the happy farm to the grey skies of the sad.  All elements are in  perfect accord in this literary adaptation that necessarily cuts a few scenes from the novel, but keeps the story amazingly intact.

 I've read the book twice.  The BBC did a Miniseries of TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLE'S in the late 1990s, and while it's length maintains some of the details of the story, neither it's somnambulent leading lady nor it's visuals can compare to the wonderful performance here of Kinsky, and the constantly awe inspiring visuals, scene after breathtaking scene.

  Polanski tells us that Tate had given him this book, as she had been told it would be perfect for her.  He did not read it until after her death, so this film is a fully realized bittersweet chanson d'amour.  A classic of cinema in every sense of the word.",1161561600,7,2472,4.672853828306264
431720,4,6302150930,"I was surprised how similar much of the script and scenes were to the 1998 A&E adaptation, which I saw 6 years before this one....the hand scene, for example (""Which are my hands, and which are yours?"" --""They're all yours"").  The scenes in the carriage alone with Alec, the somewhat disturbing strawberry scene, the scenes with Angel carrying Tess and the other 3 girls across the flooded path, among others.

It always breaks my heart to see Tess' baby denied a Christian burial.

Interestingly, the actress that plays Mrs. Durbeyfield in the A&E version plays Mrs. D'Urberville/Stokes' henhouse servant in Polanski's.  Instead of wearing a gorgeous blue dress in the final scenes, Tess wears a gorgeous red and black dress here.

Still good, but seemed to drag a little more. Also, Angel asks Izz (Isabel?) to run off with him to Brazil in this version. I thought it made his character seem even more despicable, though in the end he left without her.

In my shallow opinion, Oliver Milburne is more attractive as Angel, and Justine Waddell far outshines Kinski.",1155945600,2,1065,4.888888888888889
431721,4,6302150930,"I know there has been a lot of praise (and controversy) over Roman Polanski's ""Tess"", and while I think this is a good film, I wonder sometimes if it is a bit overrated. Don't get me wrong, I have it in my collection, I enjoy comparing adaptations and such, but it's a bit too subdued and slow moving for my taste at times (and I know that it's not a story that can move quickly) and while Nastassja Kinski (of whom I am a fan) is very good and stunningly beautiful in the part, she just doesn't seem like an English country girl to me, she's quite exotic-looking (due to her Teutonic/Slavic ancestry). Her accent is quite good, despite what some have said, but some of her lines are spoken so softly and lowly you have to hit the volume button just to make sure you can hear her dialogue. The fact that Polanski had to film in France due to Britain's extradition laws (he was on the run from US authorities due to statutory rape charges involving a 13-year-old girl), and he had been having an affair with Kinski while she was underage added to a lot of uneasiness and controversy that swirled around the production and its release. It's dedicated to Sharon Tate (of whom I am also a fan), who suggested that Polanski read the novel and consider making it into a film (Julie Christie gave Tate a copy of the book and inscribed it, ""To my Hardy heroine"", Chrisitie herself having played a Hardy heroine in the 1967 epic Far From The Madding Crowd), which I find very touching. Leigh Lawson is very good as Alec, but he strikes me as a bit too old for the role, Peter Firth comes across as quite lackluster as Angel, not a lot of charisma, while Tess's mother comes off more as a silly matchmaking woman (I know Tess's parents are ignorant, but they should also come across as a bit more exploitative, since they pretty much pimp her out).

There are other things about Polanski's ""Tess"" that bother me. First off, it doesn't show how the death of Prince is what made Tess go along with her parents insistence that she claim kin. Her guilt over the loss of the family horse is crucial foreshadowing in the plot, but in Polanski's film it's only mentioned that the horse died, so that is somewhat of a loss in the narrative, which is a pity. Also, Tess in the novel, while she was naive in the beginning, she did have spirit and pluck, but she was made very passive and compliant in this film. Perhaps Polanski intended the film to be more introspective, since Kinski has very little dialogue for a film that runs three hours. The Chase sequence lost some of its impact for me when Polanski had Tess push Alec off of the horse and her begging his forgiveness, leading to a kiss and while she struggles with him, it makes it seem as if she is ""reluctantly seduced"" as one Thomas Hardy scholar noted on the DVD special features than forcibly taken by her ""cousin"". Or that it showed that Tess stayed on for a while as Alec's mistress, although the novel did say she didn't leave Trantridge until a few weeks after the night in the woods. The romance between Tess and Angel wasn't developed enough to feel for it or long for their reunion. Also, the fact that Alec became a preacher was totally left out, so the explanation of why he reappears in Tess's life is because Tess's mother wrote him telling him of Tess's troubles (the pregnancy, the baby's death, her abandonment by Angel), which seems absurd when she could have wrote him when Tess returned with child from Trantridge. Polanski said in a 1979 interview about the film that he left out Alec's conversion because it was ""too Victorian"". Whatever. I think he missed a big opportunity there, as well as the fact that the movie jumps ahead in time without much explanation which made it a bit confusing and awkward if you haven't read the novel. Both the BBC mini and the '98 A&E/LondonWeekendTelevision adaptations benefited from including those crucial parts of the plot into their presentations. Of course, none of the presentations are perfect (there's no such thing) but I feel that these latest two capture the spirit of the novel a bit better in some respects. Both Arterton and Waddell captured Tess's inner strength and somewhat independent way (it's interesting to note that Polanski also omitted the scene when Tess argues with her mother after she returns home after working for her ""sham kin"", regarding the fact that she has been ""compromised/violated"" by Alec and she did not get him to marry her and how her ""condition"" is something they'll have to make the best of). Also, we don't get much of an insight into Tess's family dynamic in this 1979 picture (such as her relationships with her younger siblings, and their names). With Kinski's Tess, who was a bit more introverted with her emotions, you sometimes had to guess her thoughts.

The French countryside (Normandy and Brittany) is gorgeous but it is missing that Wessex/Dorset aura - all you have to do is watch other Hardy adaptations (Far From The Madding Crowd, Jude, The Woodlanders and the other Tess versions), to get the idea. I can usually pick up on the authentic feel of certain locations, and I found that was missing in the Polanski film. That's probably one of the reasons why I prefer the later adaptations.

Great costuming though, lovely cinematography and Phillipe Sarde's score is very emotionally in tune with the tone of the story and the changing of the seasons.",1142121600,7,5409,4.597308488612836
431722,3,6302150930,Compelling as the story is I would not try to condense it into a feature length movie.  It is a good movie - I was frankly disappointed because Hardy's novel is much richer and makes the reasoning of the characters much more discernable.  I would recommend anyone to read the novel and watch the movie as a light distraction.  You will enjoy the movie more if you've never read the book.,1133827200,2,387,4.422535211267606
431783,4,6302150930,"Tess of the D'Urbervilles represents one of the essential novels of the Victorian era. Roman Polanski's version of Thomas Hardy's novel is exquisite in its depiction of the mood that I believe this type of work wants to create. Tess, for all her weaknesses, does represent a tragic heroine.  Some may argue that Polanski's Tess is a bit weak, but I don't think they are truly giving Natasha Kinski credit for creating a sensitive and innocent Tess.

Tess goes to the D'Urberville estate in the family's hopes of bringing wealth to their name. Alec, the son of the family, attempts many times to seduce young Tess, and finally, one night, rapes her. Alec, shameless, seems to come across as a ""stalker"" at points, trying to get her to love him while Tess leaves an unhappy life on the estate. She eventually returns home and tries to start life anew.

After a year of suffering, Tess, while working on a dairy farm, Tess meets, falls in love with, and eventually marries Angel Claire. This appears to finally be the saving grace in Tess' life, but both Tess and Angel have secrets from their past, and they both decide to reveal these on the first night of the honeymoon.

I really felt like this confession scene with Tess and Angel worked so well because of the camera angles. After Tess forgives Angel for having an affair with an older woman, the scene shows Tess in front of Angel while she tells him her secret of becoming pregnant with Alec's child and eventually having her son die. The disappointment and mood of Angel rings forth as we see Angel become more and more somber before finally stating ""I'm going out"" leaving the room, and, in effect, Tess' life.

From this point on, both Tess and Angel have their difficulties. Tess' struggles seem to be not only a burden for her individually, but also her family. One of the tragic themes of the film is that there are injustices in life, and we see this in how the Durbeyfield family struggles to live under a roof after their father's death, and how Tess falls deeper and deeper into despair.

The movie is quite lengthy (3 hours), but I think this is because Polanski wanted to get all the essential aspects of the novel included. Like some have already stated, the DVD is not the best quality, but I didn't notice too many problems with mine. Overall, this is an effective rendition of Hardy's novel, and it might not be exactly as Hardy would have liked it, but the integrity of the work is clearly demonstrated.",1132358400,13,2475,4.600907029478458

431789,3,6302150930,"Roman Polanski's film of Tess finally makes it to DVD but in such a poor transfer that it hardly seems worthwhile. This is a film of rare beauty in so many ways and long awaited so why have Columbia given it such a cheap and nasty transfer to DVD.

The print is not new and not restored. The colours are bright and true but there are loads of artifacts, scratches, dots, jumps, speckles etc throughout the film. This is a 3 hour film and there are very good extras, 72 minutes worth, taking the  running time to over 4 hours. Columbia decides to cram all this information onto a single disc and naturally the picture and sound quality suffer. If they had gone to a second disc this would be improved but the print used is still far from perfect.

Important also; this copy is not the 'roadshow' version that played the major cities on its initial release with the intermission and musical overtures, however they have left the exit music at the end but cut off the final few chords!!!

Even worse is the sound quality. This was one of the first major features to use 'Dolby Stereo'. On its initial release the sound was flawless with a very lively surround track and great depth that particularly showed off the luscious score by Phillipe Sarde. The print used here has not been enhanced for 5:1 and doesnt even seem to have been remastered for DVD. Throughout the film there are wierd low frequency rumblings and distortions, and more irritatingly 'hiss'. These episodes come and go but generally the sound balance is all wrong. When the surround does come to life it leaps into life but with strange sounds coming from strange places in the sound stage. During the Stonehenge sequence at the end of the film when there is supposed to be spiritual activity coming from the surround channel, on this DVD version sounds like a party going on nearby. Very disturbing at the climax of the film. The sound levels are inconsistent throughout - sometimes very loud followed by too quiet and I found myself consistently reaching for the remote.

This is yet another blunder by Columbia as it is sold as an overpriced SE. Which means that we are unlikely to see a decent transfer in the next 10 years.

431790,5,6302150930,"Indeed, beauty does have its price.  One of them it seems is notoriety, for why else should this consummate jewel of a film rest so unacknowledged in the pantheon of great epics?  It wasn't a financial flop at the time of its original release, as it grossed close to $100 million at the US box office; nor was it critically denied as the recipient of three academy awards plus an Oscar nomination for best picture.  Still very few people today evoke or even recall the majesty of Polanski's work here.  It's a shame.  One I hope will be partially rectified with this DVD's release.

""TESS"" is one of the most stunning, memorable and emotional epics ever shot.  It's a film that picks you up and carries you away to a pre-feminist era where even the most hardened sexual traditionalists will find themselves burning bras and advocating Steinem, Friedan, Walker and De Beauvoir.

This movie should be required viewing for any girl reaching the age of twelve.  Not only will it teach them how to resist the lure of trading upon their youth and beauty as a means of advancement in life.  It drives home the difficulties of regaining one's independence once such qualities have been exploited.

Wonderful work abounds in this production but it is Polanski's sober direction, Kinski's achingly earnest performance and Geoffrey Unsworth's and Ghislain Cloquet's extraordinary cinematography that carry the day.

""Once victim always victim, that's the law."" - is the heartbreaking line Tess delivers to the evil Alec as he attempts to regain her favor amidst her own personal tragedies.  The upper hand, briefly, is hers as he sneers his response with a mouth full of blood after being struck sharply by her heavy farm worker's glove.  If no man will defend her honor then damn it she'll do it herself.  You go girl!!!

P.S. While the film is first rate, this DVD transfer is not.  Tess aficionados will notice that several edits have been made to the film, the most shocking being when Tess is picked up by Alec in his gig for transport to Trantridge.  In the original film as Tess is being driven away her younger sister asks her mother ""Is that the gentleman who's going to marry our Tess?""  Whereupon the mother replies ""God willing my girl, that's the one.""  On this DVD version, silence.

Also the music over the ending credits has been altered!  Instead of the dramatic resurgence of Tess' tragic theme that had my heart in my throat as a teenager, I was aghast to hear a downbeat replaying of one of the soundtrack's minor themes, thoroughly robbing the film of its powerful Stonehenge set crescendo!

I love this movie so much that I am still giving it five stars but is this the best Columbia could do for one of its classics?  Shabby treatment indeed for what merited a milestone!

431834,4,6302150930,"This film was an extraordinary adaptation of Tess of the D'Urbervilles onto film.  Roman Polanski took great pains, I'm sure, in keeping the integrity of Hardy's novel when writing/directing the screenplay.  The thing that fascinated me most was the fact that the film was completely true to the book.  Not a single detail was altered in the screenplay.  I truly admire Polanski's ambition in keeping the movie so similar to the book.  But, I feel that the movie itself is a bit cumbersome.  The movie is 190 minutes in length!  I appreciate the fact that Hardy's ideas weren't tampered with, but as a viewer, it is difficult to watch the entire film.  I was forced to watch the film in increments because of its sheer length, but I would suggest watching the film in one sitting, so that the momentum of plot isn't lost.
Nastassja Kinski was an incredible asset to the film.  Her acting was superb.  Her appearance is so intense and her voice is clear; she is very easy to focus on.  When I read the novel, I felt differently about Tess than when I watched Kinski play Tess.  My original impression of Tess after reading the novel was that she was meek and submissive.  I felt her family, Alec, and Angel easily controlled her.  Kinski brought to the role an element of independence and determination that I didn't pick up on in the novel.  Kinski portrayed the character Tess with such conviction and artistry.  She had a fiery spirit and made Tess seem much more capable than the Tess I had picked up on in the novel.  Kinski's Tess was very abrupt with Alec when he came onto her.  She was also short with Angel when he came back from Brazil and wanted to be her husband again.  Although the content of the plot is the same in the book, I felt that Kinski really made Tess's spirit come alive.
I would recommend this film to anyone who has read Tess of the D'Urbervilles.  It is obvious that Polanski has great respect for Hardy because he kept the film true to the novel.  For this reason, I think the film adaptation is superb and is worthy of viewing.",1067904000,12,2058,4.493261455525606

 The one major complaint I have about this movie is its tendency to drag on.  Many scenes were slow-as-life, showing Tess walking through a field or thoughtfully gazing off into space.  Although I felt that the film was moving unnecessarily slow, I was certainly never bored.  My attention was kept, I believe, by the fact that I had read Hardys novel prior to watching the movie.  For the most part, Polanski stayed true to Hardys story and intentions with the exception of two major themes.  First, I felt that Polanski didn't make it clear that Tess felt an extreme responsibility to work for her family as a result of her accident that killed their horse, Prince.  The fact that they had lost their horse was mentioned in the film, but I felt that an integral reason for Tesss leaving home to work for the DUrbervilles was because she felt responsible for her familys financial woes.  The second major departure from the book was the fact that Tess submitted to Alec in the woods.  Hardy made it abundantly clear that Tess was disgusted with the man.  In the film, Tess willingly kissed Alec back for a long while before he took advantage of her, thus leading to her misfortune throughout the rest of the story.
 As a high school student, I realize that many students watch the film versions of novels before writing a paper.  I must strongly recommend against this.  While the film follows the plot of the novel almost exactly, there are many elements presented in the book that even the most masterful filmmaker could not be able to incorporate, such as Tesss helplessness, Angels self-confidence, and Alecs wild lust.  All of these characteristics are magnified much greater in the novel.
 As a whole, I am impressed with Polanskis ability to stay relatively true to the classic novel.  If you have read the novel and can get past the two major flaws that I mentioned, you should enjoy the movie because it is a decent stand alone film.",1067385600,7,1962,4.709677419354839
431836,2,6302150930,"The main problem I had with this dated film was motion.  Overall, it was quite dull, and even plot elements from the book that kept my attention left me tired of the 3 hour film.  I will admit that the movie followed the storyline of the book faithfully, however some key portions were left out.  It could be said that reading Hardy's original novel is a prerequisite for viewing the film, because some of the movie could be quite confusing without knowledge of the book.  One major redeeming quality that I noted was this:  There was one important element that was retained between the book and the film, and that was how out-of-touch Victorian people seem to have been with their emotions.  Many characters, Tess especially, seem quite passive, which, while it IS a period characteristic, works to dull the movie.  In summation, this film is an accurate, but uninspiring rendition of a historically important piece of literature.",1041724800,5,931,4.8544303797468356

We go through her meeting her ""cousin"" Alec, the affair (on screen a one time interlude), and the birth & death of their baby at lighting speed. Nothing is clearly explained and it's all confusing. Enter in her heart breaking marriage to Angel and one must say just how bad can this movie get. While Nastassja Kinski and Peter Firth are an extremely attractive couple they lack any sort of on screen chemistry. To watch this movie is to spend 3 hours in the midst of the most miserable heart break and despair. This is NOT a feel good flick.",1010793600,4,662,4.261904761904762
431841,2,6302150930,"Read this review before you write a book report on Tess of the d'Urbervilles, and I promise I will make it very easy for you. If you're not writing a paper on this book, skip to paragraph 5.
First, you have to understand that this film is a Roman Polanski film, not a Thomas Hardy film. This movie, thematically, and with its other devices, stands out like Debbie Harry in the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, relative to Thomas Hardy's other works, but it slips in very nicely between Polanski's The Tenant, and Frantic. Since August 8, 1969, all of Polanski's films have really been about Sharon Tate and the Manson family.
This is a crucial distinction between Polanski and Hardy. Hardy believed in Fate. Many protagonists in Hardy's novels never seem to get a break; they walk around with a dark cloud over their heads. In Hardy's mind, they are simply fated to run short on luck. Polanski, on the other hand, believes on evil. In Polanski's world, there are people who are so filled with menace, that they can turn an otherwise happy and carefree life 180 degrees; fate has nothing to do with it; one person's life is co-opted by another.
For this reason, Alec d'Urberville, who rapes Tess early in the film, is nothing more than an agent of fate in the novel, while in the film he is an incarnation of evil. In the book, he is a minor character. He disappears early in the book only to reappear very late to announce that he has found G-d. In the film he stalks her; he is Charles Manson torturing Sharon Tate.
Hardy's Tess is thwarted by fate at every turn: the note slides under the rug; her boots are taken by someone who assumes they are abandoned. By the time she commits the crime for which she is finally executed, she is resigned to fate, and does not even try to run. Polanski's Tess is ruined by Alec, and to a lesser extent by the pudding-for-spine Angel Clare.
That Polanski intends his Tess to be a different character from Hardy's is evident by the omission of a crucial scene. (PAY ATTENTION BOOK REPORT WRITERS): In the book, Tess spends one night in a forest stocked with birds for a hunting party. When she wakes up, she finds herself surrounded by wounded and suffering birds, so to alleviate their suffering, she breaks the necks of as many as she can find. This touching and disturbing scene is not in the movie, because it anticipates the ending of the book. At the end (SPOILER ALERT): Tess murders Alec, and is hanged for her crime; thus G-d, or some higher power has taken pity on the multitude of Tess' suffering, and has broken her neck to put her out of her misery.
Polanski doesn't want you to feel relief that Tess is out of her misery; he wants you to feel outrage. I have gone into such detail as a caveat. Anyone who puts in this movie in a Thomas Hardy frame of mind will be confused, annoyed, and may feel deceived. Warned, you can slip in this tape, sit back and enjoy Nastassja Kinski's narcotizing beauty, the luscious scenery, and the outstanding camerawork by Ghislain Cloquet and Geoffrey Unsworth, edited by Alastair McIntyre and Tom Priestley. These four are responsible for the I-could-just-step-into-it feeling. You feel thirsty watching people trek along the dusty roads; your mouth waters when Tess bites into a strawberry (I still can't eat one without hearing Kinski say ""I'd rather take it from me own hand."") Your forearms are pumped after watching the milkmaids' endless work. I don't think I can describe how gorgeous this film is; it surpasses words.
What's more, the actors do perform well within the Polanski universe. If you have your own ideas about Tess, you'll have to leave them at the door. Kinski shows us a woman who has lived a string of mild abuses that it takes her a long time to process her outrage when she is violated. She shows us a woman timid, because there's never been enough in her life to fight over, so she never learned, and therefore a woman defenseless, but a woman nonetheless with fortitude. Kinski's Tess appreciates Angel Clare's passive rebellion, while other girls are interested only in whether or not he is handsome. Kinski has a lot of screen time relative to the number of lines she has, but Kinski doesn't need to be speaking to be acting; this is a mark of real talent.
So see the movie, especially if you like on-location films with lots of panned shots, greenery, thick meadows; really looks like Wessex, even though it's France. But somewhere along the line, you may want to read the book as well; it's really, REALLY good, you can imagine Tess looking any way you want, and you don't miss anything if you get up for popcorn.",1004745600,73,4620,4.580917874396135

I don't blame her for what happened in her youth, but she sure is melancholy and miserable throughout the movie, and seemed so before ""everything went wrong.""

As a fan of the novel, I loved how close to the novel this movie was. While Tess's character seems, at times, emotionless in the film, I feel it adds on to the concept of Tess being an oppressed woman of her time.
