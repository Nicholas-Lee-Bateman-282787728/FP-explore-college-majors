7158603,5,B00X5RLYR8,Great show,1435363200,,10,4.5
7158604,4,B00X5RLYR8,"This CD gets four stars overall, but this live version of ""Satisfaction"" should get ten stars.  I've never heard a slower, jammed out version like the one heard on here before.  It's like early era/Brian Jones Stones meets the Get yer ya ya's Mick Taylor/era and gets all jammed up together, and it works!

I hope the boys keep cranking these ""From the vault"" CD's out.  LONG overdue!",1435190400,9,384,4.602941176470588
7158605,5,B00X5RLYR8,"A confession:  my editorial bias is in play as this era of the Stones, just under halfway into the Mick Taylor era, is in my mind the Stones at their absolute peak.  Keith and Taylor have found their groove while the always rock solid rhythm section of Charlie and Bill is on target once again.

The song selection is flavored with Sticky Fingers cuts, played live prior to the album's release.  Yes, the collection includes a couple of duplicate cuts.  That is not an issue for me, it just adds to the run time.

While I wish this was lengthier, the fact that this band was on top of their game makes the shorter running time okay.

A great historical document with good sound and video.  Highly recommended.",1435104000,14,709,4.484375
7158606,4,B00X5RLYR8,"Filmed and recorded when the Stones were in a British tax pinch. In fact, this show was done just before the band made good in sidestepping the system by relocating to France.

With due consideration to the time frame, the audio-visuals are crystal clear. Even though the set list is fairly small, it's incredibly varied and it's one of those concerts that makes it all the way into the end zone.

The force of Mick Jagger's showmanship sweeps through the club. Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman are always holding the music together because they're just about the greatest rhythm section in rock. Watch how sax player Bobby Keys puts all his soul into the music. His solo on ""Live With Me"" is as energetic as can be and this is a song that works best with a sax break. Keys also does a killer solo on ""I Got the Blues"" where Billy Preston's organ once nested. And, of course, Keith Richards is all lit up when he covers Chuck Berry's ""Let It Rock"".

But it's the distinctive guitar interplay between Keith and Mick Taylor that most defines this music video. ""Midnight Rambler"" has never sounded more forbidding. Jagger's harmonica is the right additive to the high octane between Taylor and Richards. After this track is finished, Richards lets out a hearty grin that speaks volumes.

In this club atmosphere, standing in one place works in Taylor's favor. The level of concentration in his playing on the fingerboard is compelling in itself. On songs like ""I Got the Blues"" and ""Dead Flowers"", he gives the Stones some blues phrases in their framework that they didn't have before and they would never find again. (Ron Wood's influence is very good in a different way, especially on stage).

The finale of a funky ""Brown Sugar"" sums up the night nicely. Taylor's guitar is featured more prominently than on the studio version and he meshes brilliantly with Richards more rhythmic patterns. But the whole band has got the feeling!

The most interesting aspect in the bonus section is ""Brown Sugar"" at Top of the Pops. It has Jagger's live vocal dubbed over what sounds to me like the ""Sticky Fingers"" studio cut. It poses no problem on video because Jagger shimmies and shakes so unselfconsciously. The only thing about the video that I don't get is that you never see Ian Stewart or Nicky Hopkins although their pianos are audible.",1435104000,35,2328,4.721674876847291
7158607,4,B00X5RLYR8,"Almost gave this one a three, but when all is said and done it's the Stones playing live during what is arguably their peak years.  I'm no audiophile, but it sounds really good to me.  The star falls off for various reasons.  As has been stated already, it's really frustrating to watch yet more footage of Jagger while Mick Taylor is knocking out great, great solos.  Like many filmed Stones sets, it's just insulting to the rest of this great band that the film crew focuses on Jagger like he's a solo artist.  Also, it's a pretty short set  (I know, it is what it is, but when rating a DVD for quality, it factors in).

But here I am complaining about getting to hear a hot set by the Rolling Stones in 1971.  The set list, while short is full of strong material, and they're into it--no one's phoning it in.  A worthy addition to the Vault series.  Now if I can just unsee that idiotic outfit Mick J is wearing....",1435017600,18,918,4.284883720930233
7158608,4,B00X5RLYR8,"This is another in the series of ""From The Vault"" releases of early Rolling Stones appearances being released by Eagle Rock. This one goes back to 1971 when they played a ""Concert"" at the small Marquee Club in London. It was filmed for US TV one month before the release of their ""Sticky Fingers"" album. It was the first time they played such iconic RS songs as ""Brown Sugar"", Dead Flowers"" and ""Bitch"" live

According to the press release the performance is finally seeing ""the light of day, after almost two decades of being stored away in an attic"". Since the performance was recorded 46 years ago, I don't know if it was ever released before or where kit was stored. I will tell you that the sound and video quality are great. The camera work is so ""focused in"" on Mick's face (and the other members too) that it would surely impress a dentist!.

The core program is short. Just 8 songs in 38 minutes. The BD/DVD is supplemented by 6 ""bonus tracks"", which - honestly - will only appeal to the RS completist. There are two takes of ""I Got The Blues"" and two of ""Bitch"". Neither is really different and there is a lot of time watching Mick drink from his bottle of Old Grandad and the band ""warming up"", The fifth ""bonus"" is a nice performance of ""Brown Sugar "" from the BBC show ""Tops of The Pops"". I'm not sure if that's been seen before.  The BD/CD package includes comes in a four panel digipack with a 16-page booklet of photos, ephemera and an essay by Richard Havers.

Another observation. We are so used to hearing the audience scream during RS live recordings. At the Marquee Club there is not a peep from anyone until the song is over and, even then, just applause - no screams or yells. Somehow, under these circumstances the songs sound - well - ""different"".

Yes, I enjoyed watching the core program and listening to the audio CD was fine, but I'm not sure these are definitive performances of these songs - which show up elsewhere. And since I'm not a die-hard Stones fan, it was a bit of ""overkill for me. So that that into consideration as you read my comments.

For the RS completist this is probably an essential purchase. But it's great that Eagle Rock is at least making this album available to fans with high quality packaging.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7158609,4,B00X5RLYR8,"This is a solid release from the Stones' popular ""From the Vault"" series. The picture quality is quite fantastic, considering it was shot onto videotape back in 1971. There are no major flaws with the images. Colors are sharp and images are crisp, as if it was shot yesterday. The only blemish visually on the release is too many shots of Jagger (a given), but the plus side is there's quite a few shots of Mick Taylor's hands, as well as shots of Keith Richards' guitar playing, too. Bill Wyman gets some screen time but not quite enough (it never really is for us bassists), but his bass guitar comes through loud and clear on the stereo mix. Charlie gets quite a bit of camera time.
The cinematography is decent (it's funny to see a small arsenal of massive TV cameras perched in front of the Marquee's seemingly small stage; I remember when TV cameras were so big and bulky they looked more like military weapons than video recording equipment. Lol!) There is a bit too much closeups of Jagger, particularly when he isn't singing while Richards and Taylor work their six-string magic. Thankfully there are some shots of Taylor. His guitar playing is outstanding. He lacks some of the nervy, punkish energy of Ron Wood's guitar playing and he's even more statuesque onstage then Wyman here, but technically speaking, Taylor is a better player than Wood. (I love Ron and Taylor both.)

The mix is all right. I personally would have dropped the horns down a bit in the mix (too often the horns mimic the rhythm guitar parts) and brought up Charlie's drums more in the mix. You can hear Charlie's drums but some of his tom and cymbal work gets a bit lost in the sound spectrum that seems to favor horns and guitars. Watts clearly is hitting the drums assertively but the mix makes some (but not all) of his drum work sound a bit too soft. Now that's not a slap to the horn players (RIP Bobby Keys). I just think the drums should be as loud or even a little louder than the brass in this band/video release.

""The Marquee Club Live 1971"" definitely is a keeper for Stones fans. There's intensity in the performances but, naturally, it's not at the same level of intensity as seen/heard/felt on ""Some Girls Live in Texas 1978"" (club TV taping versus large theater gig). But Stones fans still should pick it up. Hearing tracks from the Stones crowning studio effort ""Sticky Fingers"" live is a treat.",1434585600,93,2396,4.582750582750583

The Stones had just completed recording Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Street was soon to follow. This would normally be called the Sticky Fingers Tour, but it is much more due to the number of hits the band has already amassed. The guitar interplay between Richard and Taylor is sublime, and a live Nicky Hopkins on sax drives it home.

7158647,5,B00X5RLYR8,"Flashback to 1971 when the Rolling Stones had recently launched their own label Rolling Stones Records and shortly before releasing their first album on that label STICKY FINGERS, they embarked on a 9-city U.K. tour which was a ""farewell"" outing in their homeland before residing to the South of France for tax exiles. In conclusion of that final strictly U.K. tour, the Stones taped a TV segment at the infamous Marquee Club in London bringing them full circle from where they started out as a live act. Of course, as most Stones fans know, Mick Jagger was a vocalist for Alexis Korner's Blues Incorporated, who secured a Thursday night residency at the Marquee and their drummer was none other than Charlie Watts[This group featured a young Jack Bruce playing upright bass 5 years before linking up with guitarist Eric Clapton and drummer Ginger Baker to form Cream].
For this special return to the Marquee Club the Stones were video taped for British television. The quality of this performance was pristinely restored for the sharpest image on the DVD disc of this combo package. It was the first thing I watched on my new portable DVD player[A birthday present from my girlfriend] and the quality was so sharp that I couldn't believe how unshaven Keith Richards actually looked yet he rocked his best before his drug period took over the next 5-6 years. I like the way he chimes in vocally on ""Live With Me""; ""Dead Flowers""; ""Bitch"" and mid-way through ""I Got The Blues"".
Now the DVD + CD discs share the same track listings with one notable exception. The DVD also contains a performance of ""Brown Sugar"" from Top Of The Pops which is probably pre-recorded musically but with live vocals over it. Otherwise both discs programs are half Sticky Fingers material(Save for 2 alternative takes apiece of ""Got The Blues"" and ""Bitch"") and 3 Stones classics[""Live With Me""; ""Midnight Rambler"" and ""Satisfaction""] plus a cover of Chuck Berry's ""Let It Rock"".
By this time Mick Taylor(Formerly of John Mayall's Bluesbreakers) was fully integrated in the line-up, especially on Sticky Fingers[He was a guest on ""Honky Tonk Women"" before replacing original member/co-founder Brian Jones and played on 2 tracks off Let It Bleed]. He shines through on ""Live With Me""; ""Dead Flowers"" and ""Midnight Rambler"". Charlie Watts and Bill Wyman locked tight as a rhythm section[Like Wyman's yellow Fender bass, by the way] Original cofounding member Ian Stewart barrels away at his baby grand piano, especially at the beginning of ""Live With Me"". On the DVD he's hardly shown but still there[At least in odd shot or two]. Mick Jagger's singing sometimes gets a little raw, probably because of the bottle of booze he occasionally drinks from. Love it when he blows the blues harp(Harmonica) on ""Midnight Rambler"", which was something he did a lot of in the old days besides Brian Jones[Whose harp playing sounded a tad spooky to me]. This occasion probably marked the use of horns for the first time live unless it was done on the U.K. tour at the time. Sax player Bobby Keys(Who shared the same birthday as Keith) and trumpet player Jim Price, who previously played in Joe Cocker's ensemble Mad Dogs & Englishmen,  provided solid back-up to the basic Stones line-up and would do so for their American tour the following year. You can't beat the Bobby Keys sax solo on ""Brown Sugar"" and not only that, he even tries to replicate the solo in the instrumental break of ""I Got The Blues"" as done on record by Billy Preston with that gospel-like organ.
This Rolling Stones performance caps off their first decade together as a band and the most memorable From The Vault document ever issued. The Stones rocked then and still rock as a senior band. Sadly, Ian Stewart and Bobby Keys are no longer with us but their contributions were musically vital as we remember them. I was fortunate enough to witness them live with the Stones a decade after this Marquee Club show at the Meadowlands Arena in East Rutherford, NJ and was filmed for Let's Spend The Night Together by Hal Ashby. I wouldn't hesitate for any other Stones fan to order this historic time piece for DVD and CD combined. Like one of the songs here states: LET IT ROCK!",1446940800,10,4209,4.80551724137931

I thoroughly enjoyed the recently released live at The Marquee, Rolling Stones DVD, until ""someone"" decides to jump cut from musician to musician on every beat (not everything was great that came out of the 60s). It's so distracting it becomes unwatchable, which is a shame since they could hardly ever have sounded better. Despite the seizure-inducing editing these are great performances from their best lineup. ""I Got the blues"" is the closest Mick or anyone, for that matter, will get to Otis Redding.

I enjoyed the Stones as much at their last creative peak in '78, but the DVD release of a show from that tour is nothing stellar. There were much better shows on that tour. I digress. The other DVD releases of various tours (up to this point) are just attempts to cash in on nostalgia because, ""Hey, we have video. So let's release it and pretend the fans were missing it."" Blah.

Performances are generally somewhat laid back, appropriate for the club setting. If you listen to the Roundhouse 1971 songs from the expanded Sticky Fingers you'll know what I mean.

However, for all the much vaunted showmanship of Micky Jaggerio, and the prodigious musical prowess displayed by mighty Mick Taylor and band stalwart Keef Richards, I was only somewhat disappointed by a rather lackluster performance.  Decent camera work, and the quality of the recording is surprisingly good given the technology available from back in the day.  That this package includes essentially a mirror image CD of the DVD material is further deadening to my ears.  The material sounds thread-worn as though the band was just running through the motions, utterly without a sense of passion for the material, which is sad because they were introducing the world to their as of yet unreleased Sticky Fingers, arguably one of their very best recordings.

7158663,4,B00X5RLYR8,"This is another video/ Cd from the Vault . I found this DVD filmed very well , the video is clean and isn't grainy but crystal clear . The concert was shot at a club  that's small with a good view at any seat and that's the way You should see the Stones instead of a coliseum ,up close and personal . The songs are mostly from the Sticky Fingers album with only eight songs . This seemed that the band at that point didn't do many concerts together  at that time because the songs weren't polished or have backup singers , it just the Stones . This wasn't like "" Ladies and Gentleman , The Rolling Stones "" concert video where in that video the band played more mature where this sounds like one of their first gigs together with Taylor at a small venue . Im not saying this is a bad video , its just  seems like a rehearsal concert before they hit the tour . Indeed , I wish I had saw them at a small place like this and envy those who were there .  This is a nice package again from the Vault, with a DVD /CD , at a good price . This is a nice piece for your collection if Your a fan . I also have from the  Vault : Hamiton Coliseum 81' , that's also great  with 2 CDs and one DVD, and that also should add to your collection as well .",1442275200,2,1237,3.869565217391304

SD format of course, since it wasn't shot on film.  They have done an excellent job of remixing and cleaning up the audio...I'd seen boots of this before and this looks and sounds so much better.

They do seem to center a bit too much on Mick....I wish they'd given more attention to Keith and Mick Taylor...but overall, a fun watch.
It is a bit short, at least shorter than the other From the Vault videos that show whole concerts, this appears to have been more of a promo they did while in concert in the UK I believe, just before they went into Tax Exile.

7158694,5,B00X5RLYR8,"This is a wonderful bit of nostalgia for all Stones fans. I know some have complained about how short it is; since they were playing a club it's possible they weren't the only act on the bill, and no one played more than 20 -30 minute shows in those days. Most bands I knew back then would play a 20 minute set then take a 15 minute break; and did a max of 2 shows a night.
Given the source material I think this is an excellent restoration; both video and audio. At least it looks and sounds great on my system and since I'm married to a tech guy/audio engineer it's good stuff. I think long time Stones fans who never had a chance to see them back then will really love this blast from the past. For newer fans, it's great look into the history of rock 'n roll and the analog technology that was state of the art back then.
Back then the band HAD to put on a great performance...they didn't have the dog 'n pony show to fall back on.",1438300800,3,935,4.059459459459459

7158703,5,B00X5RLYR8,"Lean, mean and at the top of their game. The Stones ""live"" in the early 70's were one of the best shows to catch , with Led Zeppelin and The Who as their only real competition. In March of '71 (when this was recorded) there were other bands still RECORDING great albums ( the Doors , Sabbath , CSN&Y all come to mind ) , but live is where any great band delivers the goods. Plenty of great studio bands, but put them on a stage and most times it doesn't compare. The Stones were actually BETTER live than in the studio, and this TV show, recorded as a ""good bye"" to their British fans before they left England as tax exiles, proves it. ""Dead Flowers"" and "" Bitch "" were yet to be released on ""Sticky Fingers"" in May of that year, and the live versions here are a great harbinger of the classic album to come. The sound is great, as is the picture. Much better than the ones that have been on youtube for years.

7158707,4,B00X5RLYR8,Classic concert recorded for  tv but never officially released this is the latest in the From the Vault series. There are a couple of gems in I've Got the Blues which doesn't get performed live very often and Brown Sugar was still new enough that the Stones seemed to have fun playing it. Live With Me shines as well and Midnight Rambler is Mick Taylor's showcase but Satisfaction is slow and never gets going and the concert is way too short. Legend has it that Keith fell asleep while tuning his acoustic guitar and the show was over. For something that was recorded in 1971 the picture looks good and the sound which has been remixed sounds really good. I can nit pick and complain that there are too many shots of Mick Jagger and not enough of Bill Wyman and Charlie Watts but what would be the point?  In 1971 he was arguably the biggest rock star in the world. Keith and the other Mick provide a nice one two punch and it's clear that Taylor was becoming an integral part of the 70's Stones sound. As good as he was on Get Yer Ya Ya's Out here he's better as he's been part of the band for a few years now. Recommended.,1437091200,4,1125,4.252336448598131
7158708,4,B00X5RLYR8,"Blame Keith for the shortness of the set.  According to Glyn Johns in his book "" Sound Man""  Keith was late for the 3pm start (leaving his car running outside in the middle of the street of Soho)...To quote Johns: ""Things seemed to be going okay until they got about 40 minutes into the set, when they were to play ""Wild Horses."" ""Keith took his twelve-string guitar and sat down with his legs dangling over the front of the stage and began to check its tuning.  For the next few minutes we were treated to the sound of him struggling to get it in tune, while everyone stood patiently around, until suddenly it  went quiet.  I looked  up at my monitor in the truck to see Keith sitting with the guitar in his hands and his head dropped down on his chest, asleep. Mick immediately announced that it was all over.  The performance was finished.  The disappointed audience was ushered out.  I went in with my crew and packed up our gear.  After around an hour or so, with the TV crew in the final throes of striking their equipment, Mick, Charlie, and I were standing on the stage with our coats on, discussing what we would do the following day, when all of a sudden we  heard the sound of a twelve-string guitar being tuned.  Keith, who had not moved and had been completely ignored by everyone since falling asleep, had woken up and continued tuning as if nothing had happened, completely oblivious to the fact that the house-lights were on and the place was empty, all but for the few remaining members of the TV crew packing up .""....",1436918400,16,1536,4.427046263345196

7158710,3,B00X5RLYR8,"As a fan of the Rolling Stones, it's great that they are releasing old/rare shows like this.  Die-hard Stones fans will appreciate it but in many ways it's disappointing.  While filmed in a club, the audience appears have been kept at some distance from the stage and doesn't interact with the band.  Without the audience interaction, it's like watching the Stones going through a rehearsal - there is definitely something missing that would have made it more entertaining.  The Stones are accompanied by Jim Price on horns and Bobbie Keyes on sax.  Oddly, Keyes doesn't play his famous sax solo from Brown Sugar.  Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart play piano/keyboards but they are mixed way down so they are barely audible and they are not shown at all.  Predictably, Jagger is the focus of the camera work but there are some good shots of the rest of band.  Sound and audio are excellent considering when/how this was filmed.  Recommend for hard core Stones fans but others probably won't find it that entertaining.",1435968000,12,1014,4.848837209302325
7158711,4,B00X5RLYR8,"I enjoyed this a lot and this is their greatest period for me.  Saw this group in 72 in Minnesota and was close enough to the stage to touch it in front of Bobby Keyes and Jim Price.

Sound and picture on the dvd are excellent. Sound seems a little muddy on CD though.  Would have preferred more and different songs for the bonus cuts but still overall a thrill.  This live take on Dead Flowers makes me appreciate that song more than ever.  Jagger in particular is in excellent form working his vocals very hard without any of the mannerisms that have marred his later years for me.

Why not five stars?  Probably half this performance is taken up by close ups of Jagger.  There is almost no focus ever on Bill and Charlie, although you see Charlie more because he is in the middle of the stage.  The liner notes say Nicky Hopkins and Ian Stewart are there but I never see them or hear them.  Bobby Keyes takes the solo on Got the Blues that was an organ on Sticky Fingers.  He does a nice job though.  He probably gets the second most amount of close up time.  Finally during the solos taking out a few songs, particularly (maybe only) Bitch, the camera work goes crazy flashing from one person to another very rapidly.  Psychedelic but I'd rather watch and appreciate the musicians, maybe have a chance to steal a few rhythm patterns or licks.

Still, I will buy anything they release from the Taylor years.  It would be cool to see something similar from the Brian Jones years that wasn't dominated by screaming teenage girls.",1435968000,3,1530,4.43010752688172

The picture quality is very good for a 1971 film and the sound on the CD is enjoyable. The booklet that comes with the package explains that this concert to support the new album Sticky Fingers was on Friday March 26 just before the Rolling Stones moved out of England to France to avoid heavy taxes that were to start the first of April.
According to Bill Wyman's book ""Rolling With The Stones""  Keith Richards was four hours late for the filming and was unshaven. Maybe he was late since they were all packing for France.",1435795200,2,622,4.362068965517241

The reason the set is just 40 minutes long was noted in the recent book entitled ""Sound Man"" by Glyn Johns, who was brought in to handle the performance's recording. Johns wrote that Richards sat down on the edge of the stage, took a few minutes trying to get a 12-string guitar in tune to play ""Wild Horses,"" and then fell asleep. Jagger then immediately announced that the show was over. About an hour later, with the audience gone and the TV crew nearly done with taking down their equipment, Richards, who hadn't moved and had been ignored by just about everyone after falling asleep, woke up and continued tuning his guitar as if nothing had happened. At the end of ""Brown Sugar"" on this DVD/CD, although guitars get unstrapped, Jagger doesn't say ""Good Night"" or anything of the sort.

I loved Brian Jones and still feel he belonged in the Stones like oat belongs in oatmeal, but the man was gone and though visually Mick Taylor was not as magickal to look at as the man-of-many-instruments, he brought out the god-forsaken Blues element in the band, a cohesiveness that they were to not regain after he'd left.

So, as usual no one gets enough camera-time like Von Jagger (not a bad thing, though it does take him until song 3 to get comfortable on the stage), but so what? We didn't expect it and we ain't gonna get what we want, but the groove is on by that old black magic song 3 and away they go into an orbital blues dungeon where we can smell the dank whatchamacallits and feel - most importantly we get to feel this band in all their gloomy glory.

This package is a great pumpkin, too, Charlie Brown, because we not only get a DVD and a CD with bonus tracks, we get a booklet and a fold-a-roochi digipak to show off to your people and then they will surely wish that they had bought one too if they didn't so you will be the esteemed fiend who has this and they do not.

It's reasonably priced, too so you might want to think about telling that mouse to efficiently move one into a nearby shopping cart. There, you found it, you're that person who loves The Rolling Stones. The one who needs this.
