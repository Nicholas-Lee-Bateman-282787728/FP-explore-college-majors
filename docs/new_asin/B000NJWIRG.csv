8179017,2,B000NJWIRG,"I bought this product thinking it was about modern jets.  It was from the late '80s or early '90s, so I feel it was a misrepresentation.  It is well-done for that era, but not modern fighter jets.",1359504000,2,196,4.27027027027027
8179018,3,B000NJWIRG,"I give this three stars because it met my needs well, but be careful if purchasing for anyone over about age 12, maybe 14.  Content is somewhat outdated, but for kids who love jets, this was great.  The audio itself is dated as well, as the narrator sounds as if he is speaking to a classroom around the year 1980, but again, I purchased it for kids and they love it.  It is formatted much like a classroom learning tool, but is a very good buy for the price if you are buying for youths.",1254096000,4,488,4.11578947368421
8179019,1,B000NJWIRG,"Not much information about the jets or the missions . Commentry and Music is boring , coudln't watch for more than 10 mins",1250380800,2,122,4.3478260869565215
