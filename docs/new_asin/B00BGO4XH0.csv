5620735,5,B00BGO4XH0,Bought this for my dad who's a big Eastwood fan--the movies in the collection are great-as well as the bonus features.,1373760000,,118,4.666666666666667
5620736,5,B00BGO4XH0,"Bought this for my father in law and it was an awesome gift at a great price, was delivered on time for fathers day... Thank you.",1373414400,,129,4.0
5620737,5,B00BGO4XH0,"This 40 disc collection focuses on Clint Eastwood's 40 year relationship and film work with Warner Bros. --the place Clint calls home. And it is a bonanza. Don't listen to any negative critiques. The two documentaries alone (Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story 2013 & The Eastwood Factor 2010 - extended version) by Richard Schickel, an American author, journalist, and documentary filmmaker, are worth the price alone with edifying and insightful commentary on Eastwood as a director. Excellent commentary and accolades by actors and directors who have worked with Clint: Meryl Streep, Gene Hackman, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Morgan Freeman, Hillary Swank, Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and more. There is also a 48 page hardcover pocketbook included with rare photos of Clint Eastwood on the various sets.

I personally like the way the DVDs are grouped by genre within the packaging.  This set does not contain the ""Dollars Trilogy"" or ""Play Misty for Me"" or ""High Plains Drifter,"" because those were not Warner Bros. films.

I'm a big Eastwood fan.  He is an icon and has an intuitive sense in choosing great character driven material and stories that resonate on a personal level.

This set is well worth the price.  If you consider the price of each DVD and individual cost for each film, it is great entertainment and nostalgia for a nominal price.

It made my day.",1371945600,38,1375,5.030837004405286
5620738,3,B00BGO4XH0,"Some things to know about this set:

- Notable movies that are included:
""Unforgiven"", ""Mystic River"", ""Million Dollar Baby"", ""Gran Torino"", ""Dirty Harry"", ""Absolute Power"", ""Space Cowboys"", ""Letters From Iwo Jima"", ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"".

- Notable Eastwood movies that are NOT included:
""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", ""In the Line of Fire"", ""Flags of Our Fathers"", ""Changeling""

- Although the product title claims that there are 40 films, there are really only 38 feature films starring or directed by Eastwood.  The other two are documentaries about Eastwood's career.

- About the two documentaries:
1. ""The Eastwood Factor"" - produced in 2010, this is a profile of Eastwood's career. It is narrated by Morgan Freeman, and Eastwood participates in the film and is interviewed.
2. ""Eastwood Directs: The Untold Story"" - produced in 2013, this is a new documentary that has never been released on DVD prior to this set.  However, it can also be seen on television on TCM.  The documentary features interviews with actors/producers that have worked with Eastwood, as they discuss his directing process and his body of work.

- If you want Eastwood the actor, fortunately you get most of his great performances in this set.  But this set is not specifically for Clint Eastwood the actor - they include his directorial work as well, so there are some films that he does not appear in since his work was strictly behind-the-camera.

- This set is very similiar to a previously released box set:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clint-Eastwood-35-Films-35-Years-at-Warner-Bros/dp/B003X2P95I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years at Warner Bros.</a>.  The two box sets share many of the same movies.  If you own that one already, there's not enough new content here to warrant a purchase.

- Like the ""35 Films 35 Years"" box set mentioned above, this ""40 Film Collection"" has the same problem - the discs are not stored in regular cases.  Instead, they come in book-style packaging that is not very secure and leaves half the disc exposed.  Discs can be scratched or fingerprinted very easily when removing them from the packaging, and if you order this online discs may even arrive loose.

- One nice extra that is included in this set is an excerpt of the book ""Clint Eastwood: Master Filmmaker at Work"". Unfortunately, it's just a 48-page sampler of the book (which is 240 pages in total). If you are interested in purchasing the whole book (it's very nice), it is on sale:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clint-Eastwood-Master-Filmmaker-at-Work/dp/B00BZCR8KM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clint Eastwood: Master Filmmaker at Work</a>",1370649600,101,2746,5.533492822966507

5620791,2,B00BGO4XH0,I had high expectations and hopes for this set then I open it up to discover the DVD disks I've come to hate since the idea of them came out double sided 2movies per disk I can't believe that this is how they honor Clint Eastwood. Stay away unless you're happy with crappy double sided DVDs that scratch when the wind blows you would probably be better off putting this collection together on your own I wish that I did,1388188800,57,419,4.25

5620793,2,B00BGO4XH0,"I would have bought this or the blu-ray collection except they're missing one crucial movie: The High Plains Drifter.  It's my favorite by Clint and I could live without the rest (except for the Dirty Harry series) and it's a classic in my opinion with the likes of Josey Wales & Unforgiven.

It was a great way to increase the number of films in my collection, providing several of his more well-known films that I hadn't bought yet (dirty harry films) as well as some more obscure movies. Out of the 40 films, I only had 4 before I bought this product. I had about 15 of his movies before, so there were few repeats. The product is also very good-looking, with the movies stored in a book format (be careful getting them out). A great product!",1375660800,4,530,4.31

8568261,5,B00BGO4XH0,"No films he appears in from the 1950s or 60s (aside from Where Eagles Dare - 1968) are represented here.
Missing are those he only played minor roles in (Revenge of the Creature, Francis in the Navy, Lady Godiva of Coventry, Tarantula, Never Say Goodbye, Star in the Dust, Away All Boats, The First Traveling Saleslady, Escapade In Japan, Lafayette Escadrille) and:
Ambush at Cimarron Pass
A Fistful of Dollars
The Good, The Bad & The Ugly
Le Streghe (only a bit part)
Hang 'Em High
Coogan's Bluff
Paint Your Wagon

Only about half of his output from the 1970s are here. The missing are:
Two Mules For Sister Sara
The Beguiled
Play Misty For Me
Joe Kidd
High Plains Drifter
Breezy
Thunderbolt & Lightfoot
The Eiger Sanction
Escape From Alcatraz

Everything from the 1980s, 90s and 2000s he starred in are here, but one anomaly (In The Line of Fire 1993).

A number from his late career that he directed but does not appear in (Straight No Chaser, The Stars Fell On Henrietta, Flags of Our Fathers, Grace Is Gone, Changeling, Jersey Boys, American Sniper, Sully); one that he only does a brief cameo in as himself (Casper); as well as a documentary he appears in as himself (Kurosawa's Way) - are not in this set.

It's likely that the most missed would be the 3 Italian Westerns, and 9 other popular favorites (Hang 'Em High, Coogan's Bluff, Two Mules For Sister Sara, Play Misty For Me, Joe Kidd, High Plains Drifter, Thunderbolt & Lightfoot, The Eiger Sanction and Escape From Alcatraz). Overall - an amazing set that I think most will find more than satisfying.",1484265600,,1564,4.635379061371841
