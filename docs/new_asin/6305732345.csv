The story line is pretty close to the book, but I agree with a previous reviewer that the casting left a lot to be desired.  Also Tucker in the book is a female and she was a male in the movie, using a voice actor ,whose name I can't remember, but he's been the voice for EVERYTHING.  Couldn't they have found someone more original?  I wish they would redo this and make it less cutesy and more like the characters in the book!",1281744000,,504,4.0606060606060606

1062592,5,6305732345,"I have this in VHS & have on numerous occasions watched it. It is a murder mystery but is a lively tale with 2 tails helping to solve it. Rikki Lake has a couple of four footed friends that help to solve this situation. It is one of Rikki's better performances along with her pembroke welsh corgi friend & a sidekick of a mature cat. It takes them all to solve it in an entertaining manner. Kept my interest as well as my grandchildren & children. Loved it!

1062594,3,6305732345,"If you are a fan of the Mrs. Murphy series by Rita Mae Brown and Sneaky Pie Brown, then this is a must have movie for you.  It was very cute and enjoyable.  However, I felt that the casting left a little bit to be desired.  While Ricki Lake did a good job acting, she just didn't capture the essence of Harry.  For one thing, she was too feminine.  Harry would never be caught dead wearing a jumper to just hang around or go to work at the Post Office in.  Ricki Lake just wasn't outdoorsy enough.  Someone like Janine Turner from Northern Exposure would've been a better choice.  And the actor that portrayed Fair Haristeen, Harry's ex husband,  did a very lame job. He made Fair appear wimpy.  The character of Olivia ""Boom Boom"" Craycroft was portrayed as a total airhead...which if you've read the books, you will know that is not the case.  I did, however, think that Bruce McGill made a perfect Sheriff Rick Shaw and Edie McClurg was absolutely wonderful as Miranda Hogendobber.  She portrayed Miranda exactly how I pictured her to be.

Am I glad that I purchased the video to add to my Mrs. Murphy collection...Yes.  But, I think that they could've done a much better job with it.",1167868800,4,1187,4.46046511627907
1062595,5,6305732345,"I had seen this movie several years ago (and actually have all of Rita Mae and Sneaky Pie Brown's ""Mrs. Murphy Mystery"" books) and couldn't wait to get a copy of it for my movie collection. Now I only wish that more of the Mrs. Murphy Mysteries would be put on film too!",1165017600,,270,4.113207547169812
1062683,5,6305732345,Great movie for kids; the cat (Mrs. Murphy) and the dog are great.  My 6 1/2 year old daughter loved it!!! Good Disney Fun!,1143417600,,123,4.125
1062684,2,6305732345,"I am a huge fan of Rita Mae Brown's ""Mrs. Murphy"" mysteries, so I was understandably excited to watch this movie.  Unfortunately, the producers of the film changed many of the characters personalities.  Some of the changes were minor (Blair Bainbridge was a doctor, not a model; and Susan Tucker now owns a cafe) but some were unforgivable in that they changed the character's basic nature and made them so shallow they were one-dimensional.  Considering that Rita Mae Brown's greatest strength as a storyteller is her in-depth characters, this simplifying them was really quite insulting.  For example, Cynthia Cooper was somehow morphed from a tall blonde to a short black woman whose main purpose in the film was to serve as a comic counterpoint to Rick Shaw -- who lost his moustache and was changed into a stereotype of a bumbling county sheriff.  This was not the fault of the actor, who tried his level best with what the writers gave him and by sheer willpower rescues any dignity Rick had left after the writers were done with him.

Big Mim was also transformed into a snobby aristocrat who makes a huge scene and throws Harry out a party when her pets run amok.  Big Mim has always had traces of snobbery in the books, but she would NEVER throw Harry out like that in front of everybody (she would discretely handle the situation).  To do so would simply be unthinkable for a southern lady -- and Mim, for all her flaws, is a southern lady to the core.

Ricki Lake delivers a surprisingly good performance as Harry and is one of the major reasons this movie got 2 stars instead of 1 in this review.  While Lake does not fit the physical profile of Harry in the books (Harry is always described as thin and muscular, while Lake is anything but) she nonetheless manages to rescue Harry from the one dimensional portrayal that the writers tried to saddle her with.  I could believe Lake as Harry -- and due to the physical differences between the two that's quite an accomplishment for Lake to pull off.

If you are an adult, do yourself a favor and buy the books instead!  Rita Mae Brown is the Jane Austen of our time -- she writes what she knows so masterfully that you as a reader are drawn into her world.  I may be a northerner who has never set foot in Crozet -- but Brown's writing made me feel as if I've lived all my life there.",1124236800,7,2345,4.487058823529412
1062685,1,6305732345,"The fact that this movie has a nice cast just can't save it from the usual Hollywood stupidity.  They started with a perfectly good story, written by Rita Mae Brown and as part of her Mrs. Murphy mystery series, and changed it almost beyond total recognition.  These books are not great mysteries, but they are always charming, full of great character development, and quick to read.  The changes made in translating the story from the book to the screen were totally unnecessary, and especially jolting when you consider how many people have actually read the books.  Why the producers felt they had to change the story, change the characters and their backgrounds, and many other things is beyond comprehension.  This sort of thing should not happen, but it does much too often.  When will Hollywood learn to listen to people who watch their movies?",1123891200,,851,4.875
1062686,5,6305732345,"This movie is purrfect entertainment for children and adults. I've read nearly all of Rita Mae Brown's Mrs. Murphy mysteries and absolutely love them, so I borrowed this from the library.  I enjoyed it a lot, even though they took liberties with the characters (Tucker is male in the movie, female in the book, Blair Bainbridge is a doctor rather than a model, etc) but that's pretty typical of screen adaptations and didn't bother me. Anybody who hasn't read the books won't know the difference anyway.

What did bother me was the fact that Harry - who supposedly is Virginia born and raised - was the only southern character who spoke without a trace of a southern accent.  In fact, the more cloying and/or stupid a character was supposed to be, the more exaggerated their accent. Might be pure coincidence, or poor acting, but I suspect it has more to do with tired old Disney stereotyping.

Anyway, it's a delightful family movie, but I don't recommend the books themselves for children.",1115251200,,991,4.777777777777778
1062687,2,6305732345,"Sorry...but I am a HUGE fan of Mrs. Muprphy and Tee Tucker and ""Harry"" Harristeen...and this movie did not do them justice.  Ricki Lake, while cute, is not at all like Harry is described in the book (tall, trim, and athletic--she works her own farm for gosh sake!).  But what really made me mad was the fact that Tee Tucker was made into a male.  Tucker is very much a female corgi!  I did not understand this switch of gender or its purpose.  The movie, taken by itself, is a great family movie, yes.  And I would recommend it as such.  But, please, don't EVER refer to it as a ""Mrs. Murphy Mystery.""

1062688,5,6305732345,"I have been reading the Mrs. Murphy Mystery series, and was delighted to see a movie version in my local video rental store. I rented it w/ my 9 year old niece, and was really pleased with how Disney handled this. Murder She Purred follows the basic story of Rest In Pieces, but changes the more gory and adult parts of the book to very kid friendly images. This is a great movie for the family to watch together, as it will entertain both the kids and adults alike. If you have a Jr. mystery buff in the house, I highly recommend this movie.",1098057600,,542,4.221153846153846

1062690,3,6305732345,"The movie is fine.  Its the usual Disney TV fair, and is fine for the whole family.  The book series on the other hand... Well, first off this is not based off of Murder She Purred, but instead Rest in Pieces.  Sounds like a slasher movie doesn't it?  Well in the original story it almost was.  The books are very violent (I believe the book version of this had a severed head in a jack o lantern) and deffinatly not for children.
Now I wouldn't have brought this up except for one small detail.  At the end of the movie (at least when it was broadcast on TV) they plugged the books as family books!  I mean Pawing Through the Past delt with gay rape, murder, and a transgender killer!  The books are not for children, while this movie is.  The movie is fine for kids, but keep them away from the books.",1061251200,4,803,4.196078431372549

1062800,3,6305732345,"At least the movie stuck closely to the storyline in the book...but Ricki Lake is about as far from the description in the books or my visualization of Mary Minor Haristeen (tall, trim and athletic!) as you can get. It threw me the whole time I watched it, which *almost* kept me from enjoying the plot. And the voices of Mrs. Murphy and Tee Tucker (who is also female, NOT male, so those vocalizations were a bummer as well) could have been better cast. I'm sure it's great for kids--but just for myself, it could have done with a stronger and more appropriate lead character. And add Pewter!",1035936000,4,593,4.5

1062804,5,6305732345,"Leave it to the reliable folks at Disney to give us an unpretentious little gem of a movie such as this.  ""Murder She Purred"" is PURRfect entertainment for the entire family.
I am a 44 year old married lady, and I had as much fun watching this movie as my 8 and 10 year old nieces.
Ricki Lake plays the postmaster turned amateur sleuth in a small southern town.  She is assisted in investigating a murder by her two adorable, loyal pets Mrs. Murphy, a wide-eyed and wise tabby cat, and by Tucker, her brave, insecure, and lovable corgi canine.  Ricki's real life intelligence and warmth come through in the role she plays.  She makes her character a spunky and appealing heroine.
The voice of Mrs. Murphy is charmingly performed by the gifted actress Blythe Danner (Gwyneth Paltrow's mom).  And the other animals' voices supplied by humans are humorously well-suited to the variety of species used in each scene.
The only shortcoming of this movie is that the villain's character could have been more fully developed.  But that is a minor complaint.
Overall, ""Murder She Purred"" gave me 90 minutes of delightful entertainment.  It's a movie that is good clean fun, something which is quite rare in most Hollywood movies today.",1022716800,8,1226,4.781990521327014
