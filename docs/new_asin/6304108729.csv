783913,5,6304108729,"A day in the life of x,y, & z. Sadly this is a tale that is as old as time and is a shared experience of many people of today and many future generations to come.

The choice to make the film black and white really helped it stand the test of time and it somehow makes the senses focus even more on the story being told.

You may laugh out loud, you may have questions, you may feel shock or anger, and you may even shed a few tears.

This film is not for everyone... But it is brilliantly told, shot, and represents soo much. I highly recommend to anyone that is interested.

There is no nudity & no sex, which actually works in the film's favor.

It's a movie about choices and the lack there of. ""It's not how you fall, it's how you land.""

Now I do have a few qualms:
-it follows the typical french film prototype: Act 1 & Act 2. Act one is full of action. Act two is where characters typically do a 180* and in some instances may become less believable then they were before. And there is always this one weird thing that happens in act 2 where you are left thinking WTH?!
-Vinz in no way shape or form looks like a teen, acts like a teen, caries himself like a teen etc. Hubert def not a teen either only Said came close. but i guess the actors cant help when they were born ;p
-the characters are up and down- a lot.
-the gun is tiny
-was it that hard to get a gun in France in that hood in 1995? to me it seems like most ppl would have been strapped. maybe that's just my U.S. thinking.

anyways watch it & love it. i watched it for the first time to bring in the new year and hopefully i can open my mind to some things, and be reminded of how important and precious the moments in life are.",1420070400,2,1700,3.967741935483871

784053,5,6304108729,"Gosh..I initially stumbled onto this movie partway into the early portion of it on cable tv some years ago toward the later 1990's as I recall. I recall it was just one flick on a channel as I was surfing but after only about two minutes I put the remote control down and was totally immersed. I was born in a big major city tho I have not lived in one for some years and I recall this slice of young male urban life where one seemed to be living in a place that left one with a distinct sense that there was little to no hope or greener pastures coming ones way, that partnered with an obvious connection to the community which we lived, some of the closest friends we've ever had. I loved this slice of life..the strife and struggles the disenfranchised eperience and the reminders of their marginalization by ill treatment by policing forces tho all lived a life that essentially walked a tight-rope of lawfulness is one that is not unfamiliar. This angle of French ghettoized life and the style by which it is displayed and portrayed is phenominal. I'm sure that there are many that saw this and felt like they got a clear sense of what youth life in the Paris Ghettos (in the suburbs as opposed to the 'inner city' as we might be familiar with). I was totally sucked into this movie.

Anyhow..as I stumbled onto this movie I had no idea what it was called and did not want to break away to the guide to miss any of it. I figured I'd check the rolling credits at the end or else being that it was cable it would likely come on again in a few days or so and continue doing so throughout the month, so no worries. Alas..I never did quite grab the correct name of the title and for some reason what stuck with me was: ""its not how far you fall, its how you land"". Well, in the proceeding time, this movie did not ever come back on. Often films come back from time-to-time  but as much as I tried to keep an eye out..nothing. This was the early internet.. I might have only just gotten broadband when it was first introduced so search was in its infancy and the ability to hunt was really limited. As time went on I never did forget this movie..from time to time I would hunt high and low with the only information I had..in truth while watching it I did not know the actors and tho I've seen Vincent Cassel and Said Taghmaoui in various movies since, it escaped me that they were the fellows in this. It's a shame because Vincent Cassel has become an actor that I respect and see as one of the best about. He inhabits his characters so well and IMO has few peers that do it so well. I'm sure locating this movie again would have been a breeze if I realized these two starred in it but I didn't and unfortunately It has meant that I have been on an occasional quest from that day to this day...literally..trying to find this film.

Just today..this very day.. I plugged the words into google ""french movie its not how far you fall"", I just gambled that I'd give it enough words that might assist in broader search results and whaddya know..IMDB first entry..'La Haine"". As soon as I read the first line on the description I know I had finally found it. The angels are working for me because if one sees where the search applied the key words for my search it seems a pure fluke that even landed on this movie. None of it had anything to do with the title and were random words found in the IMDB database description synopsis of the title. Wow..!

Saw it in my 20's...lost it and finally rediscovered in my 40's.. This film was so powerful to me back then that after all this time I still knew I needed to find it again. And lo and behold it's available at Amazon. Now at long last it is mine to keep forever.

Splendid character development, splendid story, exceptional cinematography.. it just seems so well matched done in black and white. This is definitely one on my bucket list that I can at long last rest easy that it's been found and done.",1400284800,3,3947,4.285522788203753

The film is a look at what it's like to live in the public housing areas on the outskirts of Paris.  Except for everyone speaking French it feels exactly like you're in the same areas of New York.  One of the reasons the film was made was to make people aware that these areas exist in France and that there is a lot of violence and unrest in these areas.  This isn't only a very entertaining, well-done film, it's also a bit of a lesson that's very interesting.",1390608000,2,727,4.2700729927007295

Devoid of any real hope of upward mobility, their lives are numbingly routine. Change comes with the acquisition of a gendarme's lost gun, as the three then embark on a quest that will lead them to a life changing confrontation.  Who is guilty for this situation; the youths themselves, the police who with few exceptions don't understand, or the ruling power whose policies ensure status quo?  Filmed in glorious black and white, this film is gritty, harking back to the days of film noir.  It will not be to everyone's taste but it is still worth seeing.",1386720000,,713,4.590551181102362

Beautiful spinning camerawork, perfect framing, and elements resembling documentary film come together to engage the viewer both visually and politically.  Kassovitz brilliantly portrays the 'banlieues' (suburbs) of Paris in a heart-wrenching and captivating way.
At times the film is hard to watch because the plot frustrates the audience who cannot seem to maintain hope for any length of time before its dashed again.  Yet the reality of racial discrimination in France cannot be denied - and Kassovitz confronts this reality head-on.",1386633600,2,608,5.733333333333333
784132,4,6304108729,"Matthieu Kassowitz's LA HAINE (Hate) is a portrait of youth disenfranchisement and the ensuing rage set in the public housing projects outside Paris. Before this film was released, many foreign viewers knew only the well-dressed, white, reserved and educated France depicted in e.g. films of the 1960s New Wave. Even many French people were unaware of the darker undercurrents of their own society, as no film had dared to handle this subject matter before. LA HAINE was a bombshell. While shot in 1995, it remains entirely topical today, as riots have continued to make the news in recent years.

LA HAINE follows one day in the lives of three young men of different ethnic backgrounds all born and raised in one particular housing project: the aggressive Jew Vinz (Vincent Cassell), the insecure, clownish Arab Sad (Sad Taghmaoui) and the more level-headed, pensive sub-Saharan African Hubert (Hubert Kound). The film opens on a spring morning, in the aftermath of a riot which has rocked these youths' housing project. Some cars and buildings are destroyed, and the news reports that a police officer has lost his gun in the chaos of the night before. During the 24-hour period before the film's shocking ending, this trio tours the bittersweet environment of their housing project (violence and poverty on one hand, loving families on the other) and, in an effort to pick up money owed to them, they navigate the alien environment (rich, educated, white) of downtown Paris.

This is not only a revelatory film in showing viewers a side of France they had never seen before, but it is also extremely entertaining. The performances by these relatively unexperienced actors are totally convincing, Vincent Cassell in particular. Kassowitz shuns his country's own film tradition and instead sculpts the action under inspiration from the USA. However, the ""urban"", ""hip-hop"" aesthetic he employs does not lower the film to the more vacuous Hollywood productions but instead is at the level of Spike Lee and Scorsese. The director's decision to print the film in black and white has imbued it with a gravitas that makes it timeless. That said, in spite of the fine acting and ethnographic detail, the plot itself is rather mundane, which holds me back from giving this a full five stars.

We are fortunate that Criterion chose to release LA HAINE with a great deal of extras. On the 2-disc DVD version, Disc 1 has an introduction by Jodie Foster, though for someone so passionate about the film, she misunderstands it greatly, claiming that the toilet stall guy's story is about the Holocaust (it is about the USSR deporting Eastern Europeans to Siberia after WWII) and that the characters make the journey downtown because of the stolen gun (in fact, Sad just had to collect money owed to him). The film can also be watched with a running commendary by the director himself.

Disc 2 consists entirely of commentary. In the documentary ""La Haine: 10 Years After"" Kassowitz, actors Kound and Cassell and several crew members recount the making of the film and its triumph at Cannes. The featurette ""Social Dynamite"" consists of interviews with three sociologists about the film and about the problems facing public housing. Their remarks were made in the wake of the 2005 riots. There are a few deleted scenes and documents of the shooting, which interestingly are in colour since the film was only changed to black and white in the printing stage.

One major downside to the Criterion release are the subtitles, which go too and even replace French brand names with American ones (""Snoopy"", ""Yoo-Hoo"" and ""Wal-Mart"" do not exist on the continent).",1383955200,,3645,4.99835255354201
784133,5,6304108729,Watched this for my French cinema course. Highly recommended both for academics and leisure. Stark look at the banlieues of Paris and the turbulent relationship between the suburb-dwellers and the violent and cruel police force.,1381881600,,228,5.542857142857143
784134,4,6304108729,"""Controversial and still remains at its time, La Haine or Hate is Mathieu Kassovitz's first directorial debut and, among many critics, it is hailed as one of the most socially-conscious and significant films of the 1990s.

While some sources shed light and comparison to the tense Spike Lee dramedy Do the Right Thing, La Haine takes a similarly naturalistic yet loose approach in its narrative reflecting impoverished and marginalised youth in an economically and racially-divided banlieue of Paris, France. Vincent Cassel, Hubert Kounde, and Said Taghmaoui all provide realistic and psychologically complex performances as they encompass the lives of three troubling youth.

As a whole, La Haine works in many ways showcasing underground Parisian culture, teenage violence, trouble, and horror but at parts, especially with the ambiguous ending and the perceivable lack of urgency toward the end, it sometimes feels like it is nothing more than you might find in a Scorsese film or, in many ways, Shane Meadows' This is England. While it may come as too dense and involving for UK and US audiences, it is by far as relatable as any film that deals with crime and street life and, in some ways, could be served as extra sociology, culture/media/film studies, or criminology coursework.

Considering its target audience and surprising ""tous publics (all ages)"" classification in France, the film, despite its adult themes, strong language, violence, and drug use, is felt suitable for mature adolescents 16 or 18 and older only if they can handle its subject matter not snicker at the trio disobeying the police or smoking or getting ideas about doing cannabis.""",1378512000,,1662,5.217228464419476

784318,5,6304108729,"""La Haine"" is a political film. ""La Haine"" is a humanistic film about the realities of ghetto life. ""La Haine"" is a film about France, specifically the turmoil surrounding rebellion, honesty, and sacrifice. ""La Haine"" will anger you. It will make you cringe in your seat. It will make you question the values within your own community. That is why this film swept in 1995 when it was released, why other directors have attempted to recycle the story, and why even today - 14 years later - it still remains a relevant film, not just about French society, but a dedicated relevance towards American society as well. Director Mathieu Kassovitz has pulled this story directly from the headlines, taking the injustice of the police and the corruption of the streets and transforming it into the lives of three multi-national boys hell-bent on initiating revenge for the sake of their fallen friend. It is a dark story that uses drugs and violence off the scene to build the suspense within. Filmed in a stark black and white, Kassovitz takes away the glory, wealth, and American-ized culture of project life (see Baltimore's ""The Wire"") and allows us to experience one day in the life of these boys and their discovery of a gun.

Like von Trier's ""Dear Wendy"", ""La Haine"" focuses on the gun, a rarity within the youth of the French projects, and builds this momentum that the unknown will eventually happen. This onset of violence, which has been haunting us throughout the film, a la ""Mean Streets"", finally comes face forward in our third act in a shock provoking scene that will rattle you each time ""La Haine"" visits your DVD player. Yet, this is just a small indication of what ""La Haine"" has to offer. Yes, it is a film about violence, it is a political film, and you better believe that it is a youth film, but there is something universal about this mid-90s film that continues to resonate with each viewing. For me, it rests powerfully on the actors. Vincent Cassel absolutely steals this film. From his opening dance, until the unique dilemma surrounding the skinhead, he proves throughout this film that he was passionate about the material. For those doubting the power of his ability, see his body language, emotion, and intensity behind his words - what Cassel does in this film is rare in today's Oscar-caliber films. I recently had the opportunity to watch his film, ""Eyes Wide Shut"" - again, another independent film in which he gave over 100% of his ability to bring to the screen a genuinely unique character. That is the ability of Vincent Cassell. Yet, in ""La Haine"", we have two other players that bring even more of a dynamic to this group. Hubert Kounde's performance of Hubert is jaw-dropping. There is this subtle level of intelligence that rounds out our group consisting of himself, the wild-card, and the jokester. Hubert shows that life in the ghettos of France are not just a status symbol, but instead merely abilities to get by. When selling drugs, the money doesn't go towards jewelery or cars, it goes back to his mother to pay the gas bill. In this scene alone, Hubert shows his humanity, while Kassovitz demonstrates the truth behind the scene. Said was equally as good, keeping up with the other two, but for myself, Hubert and Vinz were our stand out roles. They played against themselves so much, that the two of them became closer as the film progressed.

Watching Criterion's release of this film, it is impressive how much they put together for this double-disc set. The interview with Jodie Foster is a bit long, but interesting. She talks about her first impressions of the film, and her excitement about bringing ""La Haine"" to the US of A. While it showed a different side to Paris, the universality of the message Kassovitz was trying to bring to the screen; youth's anger towards leaders, corruption within the police, and unnecessary casualties of protest is still relevant here today. Albeit, the language is different - the message is the same. Kassovitz's audio commentary is a political one, occasionally discussing how the scene was created and the shortfalls of creating a independent film, he talks in length to his experiences within the ghetto, and the truth behind the police in France (as well as its leaders). He also interestingly enough, talks about his influences on this film, and throughout his career. Obviously, you can see the Scorsese references throughout (see ""Taxi Driver""), but he talks in length about ""Mean Streets"", and how that film spoke to him more than any other big-budget Hollywood film he had seen. Included on the second disc are plenty of behind the scene moments as well as extended and deleted scenes that further demonstrate Kassovitz's ability, and how he transformed this color film, into a cinematic triumph.

VIDEO: ""La Haine"" is an instant classic. I recently watched it with a group of people, and it was very unnerving to them. In fact, I spoke to one about a week later, and the film still resonated within her mind. That demonstrates the power of Kassovitz's film. The message is clear, the storytelling is unique, and our characters are defined. These are all great ingredients to create a powerful film. I am happy Criterion has added this to their collection, and I look forward to reviewing more of Kassovitz's work.

VISUAL: The stark black and white made this film. In color, I don't believe it would have had the same effect. Kassovitz's use of camera angles and close up shots (as well as a couple of non-interrupted shots) take ""La Haine"" from your normal narrative to a complex story about revenge and anger.

SOUND: In his audio commentary, he talks about how sound may have detracted from the message. I couldn't agree more. His tactful use of slight music (Bob Marley and local/Western rap music) only assisted in creating the visuals of the ghetto. It was crisp, audible, and powerful. Criterion has transferred well with this film.

EXTRAS: Criterion packs them in. As discussed above, the audio commentary, Jodie Foster interview, the deleted scenes, and discussion on why ""La Haine"" was made round this film into a cultural story, instead of just a Hollywood movie. There is quite a bit you can learn about this film, but also the social structure of France - which again, takes this film from being just a normal non-New Wave film to an opportunity to make a change in society.

Overall, I love ""La Haine"", but be forewarned. This is not a ""sit-down-on-a-Saturday-with-some-friends-and-a-beer"" film. This is a thought-provoking slice of international cinema that demonstrates amazing actors in their craft, a film with a message, and a director who had little to work with, but used what he had with artistic talent. ""La Haine"" will remain with you long after the short credits roll, the shock of the ending will make you jump again and again (no matter the amount of times seen), and the discussion to follow remains a pivotal part to this film. I cannot watch this film back to back, but when I come across a need to experience cinema as it should be created, ""La Haine"" will be the first to come to mind. Impressive.

La Haine features one of the first major performances by Vincent Cassel, now one of France's major stars.  Cassel has gone on to bigger and better things.  Like Monica Bellucci (yes, he's married to her).  Casel comes from acting royalty in France, making this lower-class, tough, thick-headed portrayal all the more remarkable.

Jodie Foster - a committed Francophile - does a nice review of the movie for US audiences on the DVD and helps place it into proper context.  She relates that Kassovitz's film depicts a France that has welcomed in various Francophone immigrants, but then hasn't provided them with any shot of a reasonable future.  Indeed the striking takeaway from the film is that the protagonists simply don't have a thing to do.  That lack of activity leads to a building up of frustrations that get more acute as the film unspools.

About that Jodie Foster piece:  be sure to watch it _after_ the film, not before.  [I add this warning because in the on-screen contents list, Ms. Foster's discourse is presented as #1 in the numbered list, the movie itself as #2.]  She goes through a shot-by-shot breakdown of Kassovitz's work.

That violence  breeds violence is the despairing story of the depressing society of the housing estates. The establishing image is of a graffiti, to which the film addresses itself. Kassovitz's film follows three young men through twenty-four hours. If the film has lost none of its punch since the mid 90s it is probably due to the reality of those continuing conditions. Racial intolerance and police brutality, the government's reaction to the malaise have only intensified. I felt the sudden zooms were effective and the closeups on the three leads facilitated the message. I liked the scale of the figures against the urban settings, the grubby subways stations, the flickering screens, the massive public sculpture. The explicit violence is familiar to me. I live in a racially divided town. Police intervention on the streets and the neighbourhood are commonplace.

784325,5,6304108729,"A film that created massive controversy when it first came out (When it was shown the local police turned their backs on the cast as protest) This film is something of a French answer to the Spike Lee film ""Do the right thing.""

Set in a Paris suburb a young man is in hospital suffering from serious injury inflicted during a riot the night before.  Three young men, one a white Jew, the other an Arab and the third a Black live in the same suburb.  One of them discovers a gun that was recovered during the riots, concealing it on him while they take a trip through Paris (One of them states that he will kill a policeman if they young lad in hospital dies of his injuries)

The film depicts the dark desperation and alienation of young people living in the Parisian suburbs far away from the wealth and luxury that we usually associate with Paris.  They live with unemployment, gangs,drugs and social isolation.  What is interesting though is in spite of this they still share a common theme in spite of race or religion.  It is always remarked that the working lass communities are where real racial integration is to be found and this film depicts just that.

There trip to the city confronts them with not only racism but also mistreatment by the Police.  The film ends with a violent and sad conclusion that may leave you angry and as desperate as the characters portrayed in the film.

Shot in black and white this adds to the stark surroundings of where the young men lived.  The camera work is excellent especially the panoramic view of the suburb while the song ""Sound of the police"" by BDP rings out.

Though I watched it 12 years after it was released, it is not dated in the least (a quality enough to differentiate it from 95% of film). But that is not it's mere characteristic.
The performances of three pals from a banlieue (French housing project/ghetto/suburb) are verty exciting: fun, natural, edgy, caring. The cinematography ranges from arching overheard tracking shots to framed photgraph-like set-ups maximizing the environment's complex nature; then shakey, viscerally charged in-the-mix and jangly visions of street life and it's daily violence, and in black and white, using shadows and gray's to highlight the beauty and the sadness of these guy's lives. The music is wonderful, American Hip-Hop's global influence all the more validated.
The socio-political scope of La Haine is staggering. Precient and current, Mathieu Kassovitz's knowledge and bravery in expressing the teaming stresses of the French immigrant underclass again remind that artists foretell coming storms, issues, ideas.

Released to critical acclaim in 1995, it won numerous awards, and earned both the support and criticism of members of the French Government at the time.  It explores a day in the life of three hood kids growing up in a public housing project outside of Paris.  The film effectively and at times disturbingly shows the tension between the police and Paris' minority communities.  Although it is 12 years old, its exploration of police brutality and racial/class disparity is relevant and applicable to modern American society and probably more generally any society in which there is an unequal distribution of wealth.

La Haine is shot in gritty black and white, and is subtitled.  Although it is a deep film, it is still an entertaining and absorbing crime/hood drama.  It is raw in its depiction of kids growing up on the fringes of society.  It is not pretentious or cliche like 'Crash', a film with a similar theme.

784369,4,6304108729,"La Haine (Matthieu Kassovitz, 1995)

Matthieu Kassovitz (Gothika) got his big break with La Haine, his 1995 multiple award-winning film (nominated for the Golden Palm at Cannes, where Kassovitz also took home Best Director) about three friends-- Jewish Vinz (Irreversible's Vincent Cassel), Black Hubert (The Constant Gardener's Hubert Kounde), and Arab Said (The Kite Runner's Said Taghmaoui)-- in the wake of rioting in a Paris housing block. Their friend Abdel (Abdel Ahmed Ghili, in his only screen role to date) was hospitalized during the riots, and Vinz, who found a cop's gun lost in the melee, promises he'll kill a cop if Abdel dies while in custody. That, however, is really a subplot; the movie is really about the day after the riots, and the adventures Vinz, Hubert, and Said get into as they go through the day. The three of them wander through history in the making, ignoring most of it as they bicker amongst themselves, experience various kinds of racism, help Said try to get back money that a local drug dealer owes him, clash with the police, etc.

The movie lives or dies by the performances of Cassel, Kounde, and Taghmaoui, and all three of them are excellent. It helps that Kassovitz (who also wrote the screenplay) gives them increasingly absurd situations in which to get involved. I'm tempted to say he simply hands them the situations and let them do what they will; I wonder how much of this was actually scripted. (Except the cow thing. That couldn't have been by chance.) Watching La Haine is like spending an hour and a half with three friends who do a lot of bickering on the surface, but whose bonds of fellowship run strong and deep.

784370,5,6304108729,"Racial tensions run high in this debut film by Matthieu Kassowitz.  The film, which wears proudly the influence of American directors like Scorcese, and whose characters attempt to mimic the style of American gangsters, still manages to stand on its own as a uniquely French (but miles away from the arthouse style French)expression of the combination of despair with anger that leads inevitably to violence.  None of these kids, in spite of their brash talk, really want to hurt anybody, but they know they are misunderstood and can't stand condescension, and over a 24 hour period circumstances conspire to get them into situations that can only end in pain.

Even 12 years later, the film feels fresh and distinctive.  The filmmaking is subtle, and rarely calls attention to itself except for the occasional and justified stylistic flourish, like the perfect instance of an easily abused dolly in-zoom out shot that conveys the cramped awkwardness of the characters ill-adjustment to life in the posh center of Paris.  The film is raw without being exploitative -- it manages to convey the perspective of its main characters without simply identifying with that perspective.  The actors are all revelations -- its no wonder that Vincent Kassel, who is really the center of the film, has gone on to international stardom but I'm surprised that I didn't recognize the names of the other main characters, especially the one who played Hubert, since they turn in such fine performances it feels like documentary.

Vincent Cassel who plays the main character of LA HAINE is the son of the well-known French actor Jean-Pierre Cassel.

Shot in a glorious black & white, LA HAINE gets a royal treatment from the Criterion boys. If you still hesitate to see the film, Jodie Foster's introduction will sweep up your last reluctances. Take also a look at the trailers before seeing the film, you'll understand then why so many of us were so eager to see LA HAINE in 1995.

With LA HAINE, Mathieu Kassovitz found the only way to interest, nowadays, young people in sociologic or political topics like Frank Capra did in the 40's. These films must coat their content with an attractive packaging. Hence the numerous references, in LA HAINE, to Steven Spielberg, Spike Lee or Martin Scorsese's productions.

The performances are terrific, and the screenplay does a fabulous job of ratcheting up the tension as the movie progresses.

Whatever your feelings and knowledge about the issues surrounding immigration, this movie shows you how from the immigrants' perspective, the tensions of their new society can clash with those of their original ethnic society into a powderkeg waiting to blow.  The three main characters are young and in over their heads.

One of Abdel's friends, Vinz, finds it. Vinz and his two pals, Said and Hubert, have nothing to do so they try to kill time. Vinz swears that if Abdel dies, he will shoot a policeman...""

The movie follows the 3 youths over the course of a day and night, and as their growing need for revenge becomes apparent, so does their awareness of the anarchy that surrounds them. They are faced with the dilemma of whether to exact their revenge or stand above it.

784567,5,6304108729,"I first saw 'la haine' about a year ago in a french class. then, this past autumn, as we all know, riots broke out in the ethnic outskirts of a number of major french cities. it's been 9 years since the film came out, and unlike some of its american urban film counterparts (spike lee excluded, of course) it is somehow prescient, getting better with age. anyone can throw around a buzzword like ""urban alienation"", but only a film like 'la haine' can truly convey it.

the film centres on 3 young men, all second-generation immigrants living in those big tower blocks of council flats (aka project housing, aka 'the projects') that seem designed specifically to zap any illusions of future success out of these people's lives. the director uses certain motifs to back this up, not the least of which is the ominous gun that one of the friends comes to possess that is a symbol of some impending doom. (remember, this is a french film and in france, unlike the US, there is no right to keep and bear arms, making guns a bit harder to come by and therefore having one quite a big deal.)

the sense of impending doom is tied to the notion of violence in 'la haine' (which was probably retitled 'hate' in the US because 'la haine' is, to the uninitiated, difficult to pronounce. to those who don't speak french, it's pronounced 'la ennn' with a nice emphasis on that 'nnn' and maybe a little inkling of an 'uh' sound at the end.) one character tells of a man falling off a building who, on the way down, thinks to himself, ""so far, so good. so far, so good."" that feeling is reinforced by the brilliant editing which, instead of just taking us to the next scene, opts instead to rip us from the last one, chew us up, and spit us out into the next. obviously, it's better to watch it, as I'm really reaching to describe how it actually feels, and it would probably be boring and counterproductive to just describe the flim techniques.

if you're looking to understand not only the recent violence in france, which continues to this day (see the strasbourg new year's riots) but the entire mentality of hopelessness and alienation from society that is part of everyday life to those marginalized to the outskirts of wealthy western societies, see 'la haine'. it seems virtually unavailable on dvd in the US, which is frankly very sad. dvd shelves are probably bursting with copies of 'troy', but 'la haine' is 'no longer available', except on VHS for $35. but get a hold of it. somehow.",1136419200,,2481,4.54586129753915

In comparison to American cinema, this is the disaster movie that never happened; i.e. ""Over the Edge"", ""Red Dawn"", ""Escape From New York"".  The difference between the US & France was the US realized the direction things were going and did something about it.  France didn't and now it burns.

784569,5,6304108729,"I have yet to see the DVD of La Haine.  This review is of the VHS version:

Hate (La Haine) is a remarkable film.  It follows three friends of different ethnicity through 24 hours in and around Paris.  The film begins the day after a riot has struck the slums just outside of Paris.  The three characters are Jewish, Arabic, and Black, and are all good friends despite the differences that divide them.  This is an excellant character study.  The film focuses less on the violence of the slum, but instead focuses on the mentallity of the three young men.  After their good friend was brtually beaten by the police, the Jewish one vows that he will kill a police officer if the man dies.  This vow haunts the entire film, and although it is almost a plot device, it is soon realised that it is  so much more; its a character trait that can be respected once we understand these three men more.  Why is one of them so much more prone to a promise of violence than the other two?  Does their race/ethnicity matter in the ghetto when they're all as poor as each other?  Why do the police harrass them all the time?  These are some of the questions that are brought up throughout the film.  To know and understand these three chracters is to know the answers.  The plot is almost unnecessary in a film like La Haine.  This is a chracter study.  True, what happened the night before is very important to the story, but only if it properlly involves these three men, which it does quite well.  Assuming the subtitles are done properly, the the dialogue is great, and the whole film is shot with a documentary feel.  The whole film feels real, and we can relate to the characters because of how real they are.  When I first saw this film, it blew me away.  I've yet to see its DVD release, but once I find it I will get it.  This is top-notch film making, and very good screenwriting.

In some ways, I can see this is a French version of Spike Lee's masterpiece ""Do The Right Thing"" in 1989.  Its about a lower-class neighborhood, and its residence, and how they live their lives.  A very important, and daring film.  It shows, to Americans at least, that poverty is poverty, and racism is racims, no matter what part of the world its in.  This is a great film, and very important.",1126915200,3,2274,4.362768496420048
784570,5,6304108729,"Kassovitz won the Cannes Film Festival in 1995 with this bitter black & white drama about a disillusioned urban youth where the racial problems, the unemployment and the overpopulation combine to give a remarkable and brutal portrait of a painful reality set in a Paris suburb.

784571,5,6304108729,"I've seen this movie several times, and it just never gets old. Although Kassovitz claims Hate is not meant to be a documentary or make any political points, the message is glaring and heart-rending.

The movie takes place in the span of twenty-four hours, the day after a riot in in the banlieu (Parisian ghetto) in which an Arab named Abdel is injured and hospitalized. We follow three friends, an Arab named Sad, a Jew named Vinze, and a black named Hubert (all the names of the actors, who have all previously worked with Kassovitz) through their day. Vinze has found a police gun lost in the riots and vows to ""waste a cop"" if Abdel dies.

The cinematography in this film is superb. The choice of black and white gives the viewer a sense of boredom, despair, and gritty, in-your-face realism that adds to the sense of frustration over the life that these boys live as well as the choices they make (and it is up to the viewer to decide whether they could have made any other choice). The films punctuation (separation into ""chapters"" by announcing the time of day) further adds to the malaise; the protagonists wander aimlessly throughout their lives while we are dragged lazily from one scene to the next- we never even see anyone go to work or to school, and this lack of purpose or utility adds to the characters' frustrations.

The language itself is another matter. Kassovitz uses a kind of urban vernacular that's akin to pig-latin throughout the movie (for example, ""flique,"" slang for ""cop,"" is changed to ""queufle"" or something like that). Unfortunately, that's really hard to pick up on because it gets lost in translation, and since Hate has not been released on DVD, we don't have the option of watching it with French subtitles instead of English (and though I can read French I can't follow native speakers without some sort of subtitling).

784573,5,6304108729,"""Hate"" is a social commentary on the Parisian youths who waste away in the suburbs. Kassovitz does a superb job of directing the three young men who are at the heart of this movie. The trio showcases three very different characters who are tied together by the simple fact that they are from the same neighborhood. They each have their own take and life, and I found it interesting how each character played off each other. One of the youths (Hubert), in particular, is tragic not because he is angry at the world but because he has so much potential to be more than what his surroundings force him to be. Kassovitz handles the subject matter wonderfully and with deft confidence.

Even though the topic of the film is arguably the source of most interest, the visual sense of the film is spectacular as well. Using black and white, Kassovitz suffuses the film with a documentary sensibility that is both brutally honest and oddly intimate. He holds no punches, and he is unafraid to drag the audience into a journey through the Parisian ""slums"" and through the city.

It's a wonderfuly film -- something you have to watch to understand. Its unflinching look at this dark world is what makes it so powerful and emotional.",1102377600,3,1221,4.674418604651163
784574,3,6304108729,"Three friends (Vinz, Hubert and Sayid) are from the ghettos of France, living in the projects and there is seemingly no way out of that life for them as the society and especially the police discriminate against blacks, arabs from the projects... At least that is the message the movie seems to project to me. I had a really hard time following the things the actors say because the movie is in black and white and the subtitles are in black and white AND they overlap the movie picture... needless to say, many words are unreadable most of the time and taking the time to guess what they said is perhaps most exasperating when in this sort of low budget movie, the conversation between the characters matters A LOT!  However, the movie's plot was easy enough to follow... police beat up their friend Abdel during a riot, who dies in hospital, and Vinz who is not too intelligent or able to control his temper gets ahold of a police pistol during the riot. He vows to shoot a police if they piss him off (actually he will shoot anyone who dares piss him off). These 3 boys take the train to Paris where they look for a friend who owes Sayid a bit of money. I will not go into details here but basically their voyage into Paris was a disaster as these boys from the 'hood cannot resist doing something ""naughty"" every hour. They miss the last train and spend the entire night finding things to amuse themselves, including breaking into people's cars and starting a fight in a classy art exhibition and also later a scuffle with skinheads in the streets. It all end in tears eventually, with at least one of them dead and maybe one police officer dead too, I shan't say who. The movie was, on the whole, thought-provoking for someone like me who grew up in an urban environment but never lived in a ghetto and can only empathise with what the central characters (or anyone else living in that situation) feels. If that's what the director set out to do, he certainly succeeded, so I am giving the movie 3 stars for making some impact. It could have been a better viewing experience however, if only something was done to make the subtitles more readable. The movie is shot in semi-documentary style so it might not appeal to those who prefer something more like your usual run-of-the-mill drama movies.",1082851200,3,2300,4.528846153846154
784575,5,6304108729,"Hate is a strong film about lost youth where the apparent message strikes the audience in the forehead like a nail-pegged baseball bat.  The story is set the day after nightly riots in a Parisian ghetto after the young Arabian man, Abdel, was brutally assaulted by the police.  Vinz, Said, and Hubert are three friends of Abdel that are set adrift in anger toward the police as they try to find reason and justice within their social environment.  The impulsive Vinz, performed by Vincent Cassel, acts tough as he knows that he has a gun that he found after a police officer had accidentally lost it in the riots.  Said is the follower who glorifies the violence and strives to be respected as he has a twisted view of what respect is.  Hubert dreams of getting out of the ghetto as he does not glorify the violence within the ghetto while his two friends do.  The audience follows these three characters throughout a full day as they are sitting around, getting into trouble, and learning through their errors.  Kassovitz creates an authentic and explosive atmosphere which becomes the grounds for an exhaustive examination of the socioeconomic milieu of young adults in a poor Parisian ghetto.

Please!  release this on DVD in DIRECTORS CUT!  (Kassovitz had more brutality scenes that the distributers obviously made  him take out). Anyone who saw this should check out other works of the man  Cassel:ESPECIALLY DOBERMANN!  (it doesn't seem to have got a release in  America but surprisingly it is readilly available in Britain and  UNCUT! (were the BBFC sleeping? ) IMPORT IT!,949449600,8,698,4.888888888888889
784687,5,6304108729,By far the best movie I have ever seen. True to life and shocking in its content. I still haven't figured out the relevancy of vinz seeing the cow. Other than that it is absolutely perfect. I have seen it three times and  every time I leave it with sweaty palms and a racing heart. Highly  disturbing. I wish there were more directors that had the guts to put out  films like this.,947980800,,381,4.191780821917808

7862054,5,6304108729,"This movie is amazing. It's a movie that is really thought provoking and having it in black and white, at least for me, helps reduce any extra thing and really allows you to pay attention to what is happening.",1512086400,,209,4.384615384615385
7862055,5,6304108729,"The first thing to strike me, and most likely anyone watching, was the opening credit sequence. I feel like often good opening credits can be easily overlooked, or seen as somehow outside of the film itself. This isn't the case with La Haine. After opening on a monologue that acts as the symbolic through line for the film, were thrust into the television itself as a barrage of news reports on riots and police brutality assault the screen. In fact, it almost seems to go on for a bit too long, which is the point. This is especially poignant in the world of 2017, where the news somehow manages to keep topping itself in pure horrificness with each passing day. This is the world our characters live in. These are not just faceless rioters breaking glass and roughing up cops and then disappearing when you change the channel. Regardless of whether their intentions were noble or not, these are real human beings who were driven to this point. The sequence then narrows to show the human impact with the reports on Abdel, before cutting to an amazing establishing shot of Said. The camera slowly zooms in to his face, eyes closed, seemingly trying to process the brutality of the world around him. Said often acts as our audience surrogate throughout the film. Not as blindingly passionate as Vinz, nor as wise and levelheaded as Hubert, Said simply tries to stay afloat in the world hes been given. Its telling that the final shot of the film perfectly bookends the first, with a slow zoom past the standoff between the Notre Dame cop and Hubert, past Vinzs corpse, to a shell-shocked Said, closing his eyes, unable to process the horror that just unfolded. On a personal note, I too had a similar reaction, not saying a single word for a full hour after the films end, and having to wait a day to finally bring myself to put my thoughts on paper.
 The writing of the ending recalls the works of the Kurt Vonnegut, particularly his novel Breakfast of Champions. I will still stand by my provably false belief that Vonnegut cameos as the lonely drunk man, who even jumps onto the hood of a car at one point, mirroring a scene near the tail end of Breakfast, but I digress. The ethos presented in this book, also frequently found in the films of the Coen Brothers, regards the false reality presented in fiction, exemplified in this quote (not doing this to pad out I swear I feel its very pertinent):
 I thought Beatrice Keedsler had joined hands with other old-fashioned storytellers to make people believe that life had leading characters, minor characters, significant details, insignificant details, that it had lessons to be learned, tests to be passed, and a beginning, a middle, and an end.
As I approached my fiftieth birthday, I had become more and more enraged and mystified by the idiot decisions made by my countrymen. And then I had come suddenly to pity them, for I understood how innocent and natural it was for them to behave so abominably, and with such abominable results: They were doing their best to live like people invented in story books. This was the reason Americans shot each other so often: It was a convenient literary device for ending short stories and books.
Why were so many Americans treated by their government as though their lives were as disposable as paper facial tissues? Because that was the way authors customarily treated bit-part players in their madeup tales. And so on.
(Vonnegut, Breakfast of Champions)
 Vinz learns his lesson. There is a promise of change. This insane, awful night taught Vinz the most important (and final) lesson of his life. Any other film would end right there. Of course, as hate breeds hate, a police officer that Vinz taunted earlier in the film, conveniently also from a rooftop, comes to satisfy his own conceived personal narrative. Knowingly or not, this officer is playing a role in the production of what he believes his life to be like. This is also exemplified in the interrogation of Hubert and Said by the corrupt policemen in Paris, who break from the act intermittently to teach a young recruit the ropes.
 Two specific characters come to mind that break from this mindset. The first is the plainclothes officer that bails Said out of jail. He recognizes the narrative being created in his community and tries to shake our characters out of it, attempting to get them to recognize the reality of both sides. This explains why he takes such a dislike for Vinz, a character so caught up in the fantasy that he mimes the Taxi Driver speech in the mirror. This exact scene is subverted by the second character who seems to recognize the whole stage and wires of the situation, Saids drug dealer, Asterix. Almost appearing as a character from another film entirely, Asterix immediately sees through Vinzs gangster veneer and fittingly taunts him with a recreation of a scene from another Robert De Niro film, The Deer Hunter, famous for its russian roulette scene. The revelation that it was all a trick tries to show Vinz that this isn't a film, hes not the antihero or martyr he wants to be, and how that mindset is destroying every interaction he has through the film. Fittingly, Vinz dies in the least satisfying narrative way possible, shot accidentally by a bit character who last appeared roughly an hour prior, following the apparent resolution of the film.",1511481600,,5348,4.741138560687433
