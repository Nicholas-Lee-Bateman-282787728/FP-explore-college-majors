8366757,5,B002E2QH1I,"Yes! The much discussed series kicks off with a real bang (or post-bang if we are discussing the narrative). I expect this to become our generations ""Watchmen"", Alan Moore should be very jealous. Like Watchmen: it is violent, sexy, full of meaning, compelling, and a wake up call. You heard it hear first, Godkiller is going to be huge. Buy this now so you can say you were in the know in the beginning.

Much like the release of the Watchmen motion comics&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Watchmen-The-Complete-Motion-Comic-Digital-Copy-and-BD-Live-Blu-ray/dp/B001QFYLKS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Watchmen: The Complete Motion Comic (+ Digital Copy and BD-Live) [Blu-ray</a>] this series (which was conceived before the the motion comics were released) will defy genres with its print comic/motion comic crossover narrative.
