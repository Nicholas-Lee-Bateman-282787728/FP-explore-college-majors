I've already got the entire series on DVD, but I still wanted this tape because of the great alternate intro included on it that was not included on the DVD releases. When the show first started it was just called ""Batman"", but during the last ten episodes, they renamed the show ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"" with a new title sequence and theme song. This title sequence was included on the ten episodes on the DVDs, but during repeats of older episodes they included yet another title sequence with the title of ""The Adventures of Batman & Robin"" with the original theme music which I liked even better. But that intro was only included in the repeats and these VHS releases. And in my opinion, that is enough for me to buy this VHS tape. Plus the episodes on this release are really good.

First in ""House and Garden"", Poison Ivy has been released from Arkham Asylum apparently rehabilitated and has settled down with a family. But when wealthy bachelors are poisoned and robbed in ways that mirror Ivy's old tactics, Batman and Robin suspect she's up to her old tricks. But is she the real culprit? This one has a great story in it, lots of mystery and plot twists, and some nice action scenes.

Next in ""Eternal Youth"", Bruce Wayne along with a lot of other wealthy industrialists have been invited to a free weekend at the Enternal Youth Spa. Bruce decides not to go and gives his free invitation to Alfred and his lady friend Maggie. But when they don't return along with the other ""guests"", Batman decides to investigate and uncovers a sinister plot hatched by Poison Ivy... a plot that may mean the end of Bruce's trusted friend and butler! A good plot with a good mystery in it and a great action-packed ending.

7871262,2,630444303X,"Like Mr. Freeze in the current animated Batman continuity, Poison Ivy suffers from the harm dealt by the increasing industrialization and the encroachment of applied science in the natural world. Having said that, I also note that she lacks the tragic dimension that Mr. Freeze embodies--the stories present her more as an emotional creature given to hysteria. As a result, she seems more impulsive and childish than any of the other Batman Rogues Gallery. The fantastic science fiction elements of what she can make plants do (she has horticultural skills that would shock any biogeneticist) also undercut sympathy for her illness.
The tapes in this series because they are not recorded in SP mode. You will get fuzzy pictures and sound.",994723200,,738,5.107438016528926
