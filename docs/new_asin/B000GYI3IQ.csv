8135435,5,B000GYI3IQ,"Words fail as I try to review this film adequately.  But I will try, as I think it should be brought to a larger audience.  I'd never heard of the film and I only recognized the star, Yolande Moreau, later, from ""Seraphine"" another remarkable film.

I recently saw another romantic road trip, ""Take Me Home"" which was made in America.  I liked it quite a bit, but after seeing this film I have to comment on the difference in the two. The American film follows a set formula--two very attractive young people meet in New York and travel West.  They encounter typical road trip problems, run out of money, get lost in the desert and hate each other.  And, of course during the trip they overcome their personal differences, fall in love and live together happilly ever after.

In this film, the two characters are not movie-star beautiful. The woman is middle aged and a plus size.  The fellow looks like someone you'd see hanging around a 7-11. I'm not knocking the American film; it's just that this one is so original and realistic and charmingly off-beat that it beats the other one hands down.  I forgot the American one right after seeing it; this one has stayed with me for days.

Yolande Moreau, in spite of her large size, is enchanting as you get to know her.  What a delight to see a film that shows that beauty comes in all sizes and shapes as well as ages.
She plays a strange character, again by American standards.  She is apparently married with a child and a home that she and her husband are in the process of redecorating.  She calls him on her cell phone after her stage performances.  But she is a performer.  The Netflix review calls her a performance artist but I wouldn't call her that.  She has a one woman act which she performs in small towns apparently in Belgum and northwest France.  She is billed as a comedienne and the film shows the audience always laughing.  But I found it profoundly moving, even disturbing, to the degree that I was glad when she wasn't on stage.  It has a certain grotesque, sad quality that I suppose is akin to traditional clowns.  I recall, as a child, seeing Emmet Kelley, a famous clown, up close at a Ringling Brother/Barnum and Baily circus.  He was very affecting but not really funny.  This film congers up the atmosphere of old time European circuses and carnivals that played small towns....a certain joyfulness mixed with some unspeakable sadness.

Irene, this woman, seems to be doing ok, though.  She drives a brand new car, stays in decent hotels and seems to be welcome at every venue. At one point her car breaks down and a fellow on a motorcycle stops and helps get it started.  To show her gratitude she gives him tickets to her performance, he shows up and they gradually get attached.

His work is akin to hers in a way.  He makes and parades in giant ""heads"" that he, too, takes from town to town to what seems to be village festivals.  The closest thing we have to these are the characters in Macy's Thanksgiving Day parades.  He seems to be a little closer to the poverty line than she is, but like her, he gets great joy from his work.  It's very heartwarming but at the same time you have to worry about these people.

I won't spoil the pleasure of watching this by telling the details of the plot.  This isn't a film for everyone, obviously.  It's in French with subtitles.  But if you're interested in watching a small, tender, sweet, slice of life, you'll probably love this film (and fall in love with Yoland Moreau.)  I'm going to recommend it to the local art houses in my area.",1351382400,3,3564,4.489891135303266
8135436,5,B000GYI3IQ,"Nice to see a female protagonist who isn't 5'6"", 105 pounds, and dumb, i.e. an American starlet. If you enjoy European cinema, this is an eccentric little film that has some haunting imagery. I loved it.",1266105600,5,203,4.666666666666667
8135437,5,B000GYI3IQ,This film is both cinematically beautiful and a beautifully written story of an independent woman who is a talented actress and how she happens to meet someone who falls in love with her when she isn't looking. The film is multi-layered and can be appreciated from either the woman's or the man's point of view. It reminds me of the film ONCE which is just as special. A real gem for people who like independent films. A gripper from start to finish.,1190764800,7,450,4.5
