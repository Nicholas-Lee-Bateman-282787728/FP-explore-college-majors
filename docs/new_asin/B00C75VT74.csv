8577888,5,B00C75VT74,"Excellent workout for people who are new to exercise,overweight,recovering from injuries, and older adults. I'm 58 and have some
issues with my knees and left shoulder. I complete both 15 min sections 3 days weekly. I always feel better after I finish this routine.
You only have to do 15 min to start. There are no floor exercises (push-ups,sit -ups, etc) only standing moves. I use other DVDs to
cover those type of exercises. This DVD is also an excellent jump start workout if you haven't worked out in awhile.",1522281600,,514,4.722222222222222

Not only do I feel like I can do it, I feel like I will be able to keep doing it and isn't that what you need for fitness?  I hope he comes out with more!
