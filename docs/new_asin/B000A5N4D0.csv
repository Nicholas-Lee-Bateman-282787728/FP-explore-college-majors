The waterfalls are a nice touch too. Great sound effects with the ocean views. It's certainly better than other videos.

Widescreen fireplaces that aren't too dark or don't show slowly dying flames are tough to find. The plasmavironments video has the perfect wide angle fireplace with bright, clear, vibrant flames that never die out.

In conclusion, we would recommend this DVD to anyone and we plan on giving it as stocking stuffers to several of our friends for Christmas.

Happy Holidays!",1131840000,15,707,4.818181818181818
2361373,1,B000A5N4D0,"The fireplace video is bright red.  It does not look natural at all.  They are both gas fireplaces so the logs do not burn with time.  It is basically a static image, and a bad one at that.

The other scenery is ok.  I bought it for the fireplace, so I am not really using them.",1128211200,15,278,3.892857142857143

8074646,5,B000A5N4D0,"This is my second copy of this vid. Lost the other one. Outstanding videos plus natural sound and music for all moods. Put this on at family gatherings and parties, best mood generator I have ever had. Highly recommended.",1372896000,,221,4.6923076923076925
8074647,2,B000A5N4D0,"1. Menus are very slow, and my player many times just jumps out of the disc all together and I have to eject and reload.
2. The audio is not a match to the view. The water scenes are of waves, bays, waterfalls, but the sound is all where the camera was.......waaaaay back, and all you hear is what sounds like a tiny brook.
3. The views were very good pictures, and I did appreciate the wide screen",1357603200,,398,4.115384615384615
8074648,4,B000A5N4D0,"We were preparing a big party, and it was a record cold month. Since we have no real fireplace at our home we've decided to try a fake one. We used the DVD on our large screen plasma and were amazed! It crackled and glowed, and the 50 guests who braved the elements to attend the party all in turn warmed up by the ""flames"". I liked the  ""natural"" fire although my wife preferred the ""gas""--both available. The ""mood"" scenes on the DVD were not as effective. Although beautifully filmed,every scene was windy and grey . The ""fireplace"" would work best on a screen that is smaller than our 50"" and closer to the ground.",1233964800,2,618,4.373913043478261
8074649,5,B000A5N4D0,"Glass of wine, cool outside - but no real fireplace?  This fits the bill more than you might think. Buy it!!!",1231545600,,109,4.190476190476191
8074650,5,B000A5N4D0,"We bought this DVD to play on our various plasma screens around the office. We play it during some of the colder months, but it really shines during Hanukkah and Christmas.

When we put the decorations up and have the plasmavironments fireplace DVD playing, it really makes the cold office feel like a warm, inviting holiday scene. The bright flames also create a nice flickering effect across the waiting room. That adds a nice touch.

The DVD works great when it loops. You press play and the DVD does the rest.

The only thing I would add is a snow scene. We're in California.",1174608000,9,579,4.548076923076923
8074651,5,B000A5N4D0,"This dvd is neat.  You have to watch out for leaving it on to long if you have certain tv's though as it will creat a ""burn-in"" on your tv.  I don't use it much, but it's neat to have for when company comes over and there is more conversation thatn watching tv.",1173657600,7,261,3.9056603773584904
8074652,5,B000A5N4D0,I bought this for our holiday party and it works really well.  Had many features I did not even know about.  It of course has the log but it also has other nature films to view.  You can listen to the natural sounds of what you are looking at or you can listen to music.  I sometimes just like to watch the ocean and listen to the sounds of the waves breaking on the shore.  Reminds me of living at the beach!  Well made and great picture quality for my plasma.,1168128000,7,461,4.010989010989011
