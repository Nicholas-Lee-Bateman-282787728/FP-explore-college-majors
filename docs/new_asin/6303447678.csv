7902263,3,6303447678,"This video includes tips for warming-up,stretches,defense,attacking,headers, free kicks,goal keeping, and much more. It covers just about everthing you need to know if you play on a rec or a traveling team. My parents enjoyed watching this video too.
I thought this was a pretty good video if you are an intermediate player. If you have been playing on teams for over 7 or 8 years, this video is probably not the best for you. Otherwise, I recomend this video to all the other intermediate players interested in improving their skills. I have been playing for a long time and still find a couple things in this video helpful.",1046995200,12,625,4.796296296296297
