8390426,5,B0037B450K,This fitness video was quite difficult for me (a regular exerciser/Crossfitter) but it was exactly what Id hoped for. I ended the workout tired of body but completely rejuvenated in my mind. Safe for the Christian who wants a yoga type exercise without the spiritual hang-ups.,1511913600,,276,5.021739130434782
8390427,4,B0037B450K,Great way to exercise and in a beautiful setting. I wish they would have slowed down the intro to the exercises a bit though because it was a bit hard to keep up the first time through. Definitely worthwhile and a great alternative to yoga.,1470441600,,240,4.355555555555555
8390428,5,B0037B450K,"This DVD has become my favorite. As a Christian I appreciated hearing Laura Monica's testimony on a television show. She was struggling with major health issues, and was trying to find an exercise program that incorporated her spirituality as well as her exercise needs. She was unable to find one, and had to make her own. I am so glad she did because what she has done is amazing. Because of her asthma she was unable to do jarring aerobic exercise routines. I myself used to only do intense aerobic exercise, but lately I can't stomach jarring, loud, thumping music anymore in an exercise DVD. I try to exercise in the morning before my kids get up (this doesn't always work out for me).  The music is calming, incorporates scripture, and speaks of the Lord. I also grew tired of the scantily dressed instructors on exercise videos telling me how I will be bikini ready. I don't want to be bikini ready. I don't even wear bikinis. I exercise for the health of my soul, body, and mind. I don't exercise to look good in a swimsuit, but this DVD will help you lose weight. It is still a great work out. This was just what I wanted. The instructors are modestly dressed, the DVD is set in a beautiful location, the movements are energizing and I feel so good after doing them. Laura Monica has done an amazing job with this DVD. I am going through a very difficult period in my life right now. I read my KJV Bible every morning, and I fit this DVD somewhere in my day. I have two small children so my very sweet husband usually has to watch my three year old so I can do it. It has helped me immensely. I have seen huge improvements in my health doing this daily in combination with reading my Bible. Thank you Wholy Fit. What a blessing it has been to my life.",1454803200,4,1760,4.333333333333333
8390429,5,B0037B450K,"As a Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation Medical Doctor and also as a Christian, I love this exercise DVD! There are so many things I love about it, in fact, that I hardly know where to begin. First, I love the ""feel"" of it (the setting, the backdrop, the background music, the Scriptures). Second, I love the instruction and gentle reminders and prompts. Third, I love how the intensity builds and continues to challenge me, no matter how many times I watch it. Fourth, I love how ""smooth"" the transitions are from one movement to the next. And last but not least, I love Laura's excellent ability to  lead me and instruct me, all the while keeping her and my heart focused on the Lord. It's like I'm exercising ""to the glory of God,"" as it suggests in 1 Corinthians 10:31 (Whatever you do, whether you eat or drink, do it to the glory of God--paraphrased). Thank you, Laura, for creating this wonderful DVD. I recommend it to my patients!

8390430,5,B0037B450K,"This is a great DVD.  Done in a beautiful setting with calming music, you don't even realize how long you have been working out until you reach the meditation.  It is definitely an intermediate DVD and has a lot of balancing poses.  I have done yoga in the past and was uncomfortable with it because of the religious connotations.  This DVD does not take traditional yoga and just turn it ""Christian"" by adding Christian music and words.  It uses different poses and stretches, but you get the same intense workout and benefits.",1317686400,7,528,4.695652173913044
8390431,4,B0037B450K,"Wholy Fit Christian Alternative to Yoga is an excellent flexibility program managable for most fitness levels.  The calming music and scripture assist the participant in moving through the postures which are uncomplicated and make sense.  There is no pressure for the user to become uncomfortable or to flex to a painful level, and there are various levels demonstrated by the instructors on the DVD.  This DVD will benefit mind, body and spirit.

8390432,5,B0037B450K,"This is a great work-out DVD.  I have two other WholyFit videos - the Basic level Fruit of the Spirit, and SloFlo.  This video is much more difficult than the Basic level, though not impossible.  It has the best music of the three, in my opinion, and is wonderfully done.  There is less Scripture meditation than in the Basic level, but the entire tone of the workout remains worshipful.  I highly recommend it and the other WholyFit videos.",1287273600,8,441,4.602564102564102
