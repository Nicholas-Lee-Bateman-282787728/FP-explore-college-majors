8287177,4,B001CDR1EW,"If you were disappointed by it's predecessor Zombie Night, then maybe this one is still worth a chance to you. If you even remotely liked Zombie Night then you will love this... it's ten times better!!!

Sure it's not the greatest Zombie movie out there, but it's more than half way up the scale.

An excellent soundtrack, decent actors (compared to Zombie Night), some excellent action and cool zombies make this at least a once see for zombie fans...

Watch the Making Of feature, especially if you plan on watching the third installment in the trilogy REEL ZOMBIES.",1243728000,3,568,4.775510204081633
