It seemed for years it was not available on the market so when I saw it on Amazon I jumped at the chance to buy it.  Let me say if you are looking for high quality HD video and audio then forget it. But if you like Jobin, DeMoraes and Toquinho; have studied or followed their impact on music then you will appreciate this old video. The performance is up front and personal.",1387756800,,458,3.924731182795699
