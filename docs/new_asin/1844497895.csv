7800778,4,1844497895,"I bought this DVD & lesson booklet set despite the previous, scathing review.
With all due respect to the writer of the previous review, I believe his critique is unreasonably harsh.
I have had a copy of the booklet without the video since 1988.
The VHS to DVD transfered well from the original Star Licks production.
It is true that the music notation takes some getting used to as opposed to contemporary tablature, but that is no big deal at all.
And there are no ""note-by-note"" songs presented, but there are some good examples taken from Alcatrazz & Rising Force solos.
Also if a person knows what to look for, they would see that there is more than one arpeggio in these examples.
As a guitarist of considerable skill, I assure you that this material is far beyond novice level instruction.
So if a person wants to study & analyze some Yngwie Malmsteen style signature licks, this is a worthwhile product.",1336003200,2,911,4.6645962732919255
7800779,1,1844497895,"All this is is a re-release/repackaging of a very old Star Licks VHS tape that was put out back in the mid-'80s by Wolf Marshall. It was the first ever instructional video on the style of Yngwie Malmsteen. I remember renting this from a local music store many years ago. While there is a 20 page booklet that accompanies the dvd, it was originally formulated before tablature notation came out, so it's very.....""unusual"" to read.
On the front of the dvd cover, it reads: ""Note by note lessons on how to play classic Yngwie Malmsteen songs"". That is an absolute lie. There are no licks whatsoever from any of YM's tunes. All Wolf Marshall did was introduce the viewer to the minor scale, the harmonic minor scale, and the diminished scale using a grand total of 59 very short licks. There's only one arpeggio throughout the entire dvd. Clearly, the video was designed with the rank beginner in mind.
Wolf Marshall is a great instructor and transcriber, But I've always been a bit critical of him. Perhaps too much. He's always tried to make things more difficult and more involved than they have to be. And any time he's tried to transcribe or provide instruction concerning Yngwie, he's always missed the mark. He just doesn't view the the fretboard or approach a solo the way Yngwie does. Yngwie himself has put out instructional material through REH and Young Guitar (Japan) and that's the way to go.",1262822400,7,1403,4.7073170731707314
