8342358,5,B001TW68FE,"After my decision to purchase to purchase the Nikon D3200 I decided it was time to learn Photoshop. I've had the program sitting in my computer for a couple years. I was a student and at the time it was really affordable, cheaper than buying Elements from a store, so I bought it. I know a little bit about Photoshop but not enough to accomplish anything other than simple cropping and adjustments. Layers have always confused me. Not anymore! He explains layers in such a simple way, anybody can understand it.

I received the DVD in the mail yesterday. There's a lot of information and I've been studying it for hours. It's so much better having this information in one place than searching the web for days. After one viewing I feel like the chapters are laid out in a very logical way. You learn the basics like layers, what PS is, how to navigate, etc. He progresses to the task that are more complicated, such as advanced layers and retouching, as you go through the chapters. He explains it all in a way that makes sense. I already feel like I have a better grasp on what the amazing software is capable of. I also feel like even intermediate PS users would find this DVD beneficial because of how comprehensive it is.

I love this DVD. I think in the next few days I'm going to love it even more. I already view it as a valuable resource that I can keep going back to when I have questions. It's easy to do that too because all the chapters are labeled and easy to find/navigate. I will say at first it does feel a little overwhelming. However, you're not going to learn Photoshop overnight. It appears to me this DVD will teach everything you need to know about how to use PS. It's far more comprehensive than just a simple ""here's how you make a girl look thinner"". In those type of YouTube videos, you follow step by step, but you don't really know what the tool is or why it's doing what it's doing. This DVD is more like, here's the tools/screens/settings, this is exactly what they do. I love that because I'm not just following instructions, I'm learning what the program and all it's tools/screens/settings do.",1378425600,6,2126,4.4627249357326475
