2790235,5,B000O59A1G,I am just thrilled that this is out on DVD..regardless of some of the short comings people mention..It's nice to know the short comings others mentioned but it would not keep me from buying this or giving anything less than 5 stars.. Just be happy they are finally releasing Gomer on DVD.,1184803200,2,288,4.5576923076923075

2790237,3,B000O59A1G,"I just finished watching the entire second season of Gomer Pyle and I wasn't disappointed in the least. This show has held up very well indeed.
The first season I thought got off to a slow start as it founds its' feet but this season it almost hits the ground running and the laughs abound.
Again we have good old forever-the-optimist Gomer making his way through his hitch with the Marine ""corpse""(sic) with his platoon Sergeant Vince Carter barking at his heels all the way.
This season scripts I thought were a bit funnier and faster paced than the previous season and Frank Sutton got more latitude,laughs and camera time than usual. The producers knew after the first season what an impact Sutton had made to the show and this was only re-enforced more as the second season continued thus beefing his part up. And to Sutton's credit he gives it all he's got and more.
At this stage in the series to think of Gomer sans Carter or visa versa was unthinkable,so ingrained were they now with the viewing public. And it is the obvious on and off screen chemistry(they were good friends) between the two that also helped propel this show into high ratings and ultimately
TV history.
The show has many stalwarts of the then studio acting ""colony"" that come and go along with future TV names(I'll let you discover them on your own).However a few names from the Andy Griffith show(its' parent show) make appearances,Opie,Andy,Goober and others to help things along. In fact the ep with Andy and Opie in it resembles more an Andy Griffith Show than a Gomer Pyle one,replete with end moral. But it still works.
This season is the first season in colour and the shows are generally transferred well,quite crisp. There are some obvious signs of wear and flaws though and in quite a few the end credit music's pitch deviates quite a bit...unusual to hear. Also the outside of the DVD case gives mention to some ""editing"" of these eps and if I hadn't read here that it was some incidental music I would never have known as the music seems blended flawlessly to each ep no matter where it may occur. I can only assume there were some problems with clearance that caused it to be edited. But as I say I can not tell you where the music might have been changed as it is seamless! I don't like seeing that a show of this caliber or ANY caliber for that matter has undergone changes for any reason. If there are changes the buying public(us) should be given clear cut descriptions of exactly what it is that has been changed and for what reason. After all we are paying for this product and I believe we have a right to know. To insert a couple of lines of explanatory text somewhere in the set is to me a no-brainer. Now if actual scenes have been cut,and I don't see that there have been,then we definitely need/deserve some more detailed explanation....don't we CBS/Paramount!!??
So it's for this reason and the fact that this set has absolutely not a shred of extras,nothing,nada,ka-put.....that I'm giving it only 3 1/2 stars(it deserves a four or a little more).
Other than this this set is one to definitely own. Season two is now in colour and improved even more over the first(script wise).The Sutton/Nabors chemistry is in full swing and they both propel this series individually and together along quite well.
Again as I have said ad nauseum and will continue to say this is entertainment that the whole family can enjoy together and what show made in this day and age can you say that about???",1183766400,6,3490,4.594551282051282
2790238,4,B000O59A1G,"Frank Sutton does it again...he upstages Jim Nabors at almost every turn! His hilarious facial expressions are reminiscent of Jackie Gleason's wide-eyed portrayal of ""The Honeymooners""' Ralph Kramden. I watched the Oscar-winning 1955 film ""Marty"" recently, where Frank Sutton played one of Ernest Borgnine's buddies...Sutton looks exactly like he would on ""Gomer Pyle USMC"" - he didn't seem to age at all in the ten years between ""Marty"" and ""Gomer"" - watch 'em and see for yourself! He's great!

This second season of ol' Gome was the first to be in color - and, unlike the first color episodes of ""The Andy Griffith Show,"" these Gomer shows are still as fresh and funny as the first season. And there are guest stars a-plenty: Jamie Farr, William Christopher, Ronny Howard, Andy Griffith, George ""Goober"" Lindsey, Ted Knight, Susan Oliver, Joyce Jameson, Jerome Cowan, Gigi Perreau, Michael Conrad, Tige Andrews, Brendon Boone, Dabbs Greer, Jackie Joseph and Jack ""Jimmy Olsen"" Larsen.

Also, many regular actors who guested on ""The Andy Griffith Show"" make appearances, like Parley Baer, Enid Markey, Maudie Prickett and Maggie ""Charlene Darling"" Petersen.

Roy Stuart makes his first appearance as Corporal Boyle, Allan Melvin debuts as Sergeant Hacker and, best of all, Barbara Stuart finally portrays Vince Carter's girlfriend, Bunny Wilson (wait'll you see her in those tight slacks! Hubba Hubba!).

The reason I gave this set four stars is ONLY because it doesn't have ANY special features as the first set did....NONE....but the stories, acting, color, crispness and direction are definitely five star-worthy. You'll have fun!",1183248000,25,1635,5.325581395348837
2790239,4,B000O59A1G,"I was angered to read the small print on the box that advises that some music has been changed and episodes may be edited.  Yikes.  I suspected that the music changes would occur in restaurants, etc. when they have dance music going in the background.  So far I am right.  I hate they changed it, but the music isn't too bad.  On the other hand, haven't seen any edits yet.  Hope there aren't any.  Why would a company go to all the trouble to remaster edited versions (and the episodes look fantastic by the way).  Would have given 5 stars but because the b.g. live action music was changed, had to knock off a star.  I'll post again if I spot any missing footage.",1182902400,21,665,4.298387096774194

2790269,3,B000O59A1G,"I completely agree with other reviewers in that the edits and cuts are ridiculous and uncalled for as they do affect the nostalgic merits of the show.  As a child growing up, it was the music of Jim Nabors that I looked forward hearing in these episodes.  His singing voice was amazing and it made the show!  I collected the series as they came out and after the first season, I just assumed that all the seasons would be as wonderful so I quickly saved my ducketts and bought each season as they became available and they weren't cheap when I got them!  Unfortunately, I didn't watch each season epidose by episode.  Recently, I was watching Gomer Pyle on ""Decades"" Tv which is a digital channel available in my local area.  They aired the series for seveal days.  I saw episode 21 where Gomer helps a lonely little girl (daughter of a visiting Colonel), ""Little Girl Blue"".  Growing up it was one of my favorites.  While watching it I noticed that the network didn't show Gomer singing ""Put On A Happy Face""  to the little girl.  I got upset!  So I went to my DvDs and was determined to watch the show in its entirety, only to be shocked, disappointed and totally angered that the musical number had been cut from the season 2 ""alleged"" complete series.  I was furious!!!  In fact I still am!!  I really looked forward to watching the shows in their entirety and I feel that it is unfair to the consumer for the manufacturer to delete any portion of the show!",1426032000,,1461,4.43984962406015

2790284,2,B000O59A1G,"I got the full series - 5 years. The first 2 seasons were great, but as they went on....it went down hill. It starts with the country boy going to the city (albeit in the army) and bringing his country upbringing with him and how Carter was always bailing Gomer out but in a good way and all. Hilarious the first 2 seasons, but then they started ""smarting"" Gomer up and ""dummy down"" Sgt Carter... The final season was terrible. They had Carter doing nothing but yelling at Gomer. It just over took the whole story and plot and they made him so stupid and doing stupid things, it looked like Gomer was smartest man in the world! Enjoy the first 2 seasons, but don't look for much after that",1387670400,,689,4.3076923076923075
2790285,5,B000O59A1G,"Great entertainment! Always enjoyed watching this show. Jim Nabors and Frank Sutton were great together.

2790286,5,B000O59A1G,"Jim Nabors returns as Gomer Pyle for yet another season of hijinks & hilarity. Gomer moves up in rank this season, so it's up to Sgt. Carter to see that everyone in his platoon passes the exam to make the rank of Private First Class. Poor Sergeant Carter! Chaos ensues in ""Third Finger, Left Loaf"", when one of Carter's men loses an engagement ring, which Gomer is asked to hold for safe keeping. Nothing's quite safe when Gomer's around, for certain! Gomer's assigned to train a feisty German Shepherd in ""Gomer Un-Trains A Dog"". Gomer ends up turning this once-prized dog into a pussycat! When it comes to important assignments, leave it to Gomer to foul everything up - such is the case in the episode ""Gomer Captures A Submarine"", where Sgt. Carter & crew can't sail past the dock - thanks to Gomer! Sergeant Carter didn't learn his lesson in the episode ""Gomer Minds His Sergeant's Car"" - where Carter is assigned to capture a recruit who's gone AWOL, so he gives Gomer an assignment to tend to his car while he's away...Oh, brother! Gomer Pyle is given a week-long furlough, courtesy of Sgt. Carter in the very funny episode ""Gomer, The Civilian"". Instead of spending his furlough away from the base, Gomer decides to spend his ""vacation"" at Camp Henderson, which drives the Sergeant up a wall! Gomer tries to return a big bag of coins in ""Gomer & The Phone Company"", but is given the runaround by phone company employees. Gomer & Sgt. Carter are off to Las Vegas, courtesy of Gomer winning a radio contest in ""Vacation In Las Vegas"", although Carter wasn't going to exactly have the time of his life as he had thought! Gomer persuades Duke to appear as a nightclub comic in ""Duke Slater, Nightclub Comic"" - where a certain impression of his platoon sergeant nearly lands Duke in hot water! Gomer's Cousin Goober pays a visit, & nearly gets Gomer discharged in the episode ""A Visit From Cousin Goober"" - featuring guest-star George Lindsey. There are plenty of episodes & laughs to go around in this season of ""Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C. - The Second Season"". Don't get left behind - order your copy today!

2790287,5,B000O59A1G,"Wow, this is a great show and the first of the four seasons to be in color. These episodes are really good, and this season and Season 3 are probably my favorites, even though Season 1 is still really great, it brings out a lot when the show is in color. Season 2 aired from September 17, 1965 to April 16, 1966. This set contains 30 episodes on 5 discs. My favorites from here are P.F.C. Gomer Pyle, Home on the Range, Gomer Captures a Submarine, Gomer Minds His Sergeant's Car, Grandma Pyle Fortune Teller and A Star is Born, even though I like them all a lot. I got this set quickly, within  a week of when I ordered them. When I opened them, all of the discs were there, of which I was very happy seeing as I ordered them from a private seller on Amazon.

Frank Sutton returns as the cantankerous Sgt. Carter, and Ted Bessell (who later went on to star in That Girl with Marlo Thomas) is introduced as Gomer's friend Frank.

Notable episodes include ""Opie Joins the Marines,"" where Andy Griffith and Ron Howard (of The Andy Griffith Show, of which Gomer Pyle is a spin-off) guest star. There are also a few episodes in which Jim Nabors sings, in his beautiful real voice.

This is much better as it allows for easier storage. As for the editing of the shows as mentioned in other reviews, I haven't seen anything yet that would constitute a harsh problem other than the songs Jim Nabors sang in some of the episodes being removed. Since the program is not a musical variety show, but rather a situation comedy, I see no real reason to get upset over this editing, unless you're a diehard fan of Jim Nabors' vocals and want a video performance of a particular tune. Otherwise, this is classic TV comedy from the 60s. REAL comedy before the sarcasm and ignorance of today's TV became the norm. Nabors and Frank Sutton should be ranked in history along side the likes of Abbott and Costello, Laural and Hardy, and Martin and Lewis as one of the greatest comedy duos of all time. Anyone who can't laugh at any one of these hilarious episodes has absolutely NO concept of humor whatsoever.

2790310,1,B000O59A1G,"Don't get me wrong -- Gomer is a 5-star TV show, but Paramount's infuriating censorship of these episodes cuts some of the very best moments, such as Gomer singing to the dog Killer [a.k.a.

If you liked this show, there's some really great episodes.  The episode with Grandma Pyle and Sgt. Carter's funny voice makes the entire set worthwhile.
