3012943,5,B000Y7U9A0,You don't have to be Jewish ...  this is a wonderful DVD and shows a piece of history everyone should be aware of.,1206057600,3,114,3.9565217391304346
3012944,5,B000Y7U9A0,"I watched the entire series when it recently ran on PBS.  Once I started watching it from the very beginning, when the Sepphardic Jews came to America, I was instantly hooked.  I especially enjoyed the commentary by various people that recalled what Jewish life was like during the 1940s, especially during WW2.  The insight provided by rabbis was informative as well.  Another segment that stands out is the 1950s when Jewish Americans vacationed in the Catskills of upstate New York.  Any big name Jewish comedian that you've seen in various TV sitcoms, variety shows and movies got their start at the many nightclubs of the Catskills.  Sid Cesar himself even said that performing there was like his 'going to college'.  If audiences in those clubs laughed, they knew they were doing their job right.  Anyone interested in learning about the Jewish religion, customs and ways of life can't go wrong with owning this series.  Fascinating through and through.",1204675200,13,959,5.018987341772152

3012947,5,B000Y7U9A0,This documentary traces the history of Jews in American.  It is told in an entertaining yet informative style. The first part on the colonial Jews was extremely educational.  The last part on post World War II American Jews helped me relive pleasant memories.  The Jewish Americans should be in everyone's dvd library.,1203811200,,318,5.076923076923077
3012948,5,B000Y7U9A0,"This great series is a Jewish version of a Ken Burns documentary. The images are great and the characters fascinating. But what stood out for me was how all the material was told in story form. It would have been easy just to assemble material without trying to make sense of it as a narrative. This film did tell that story magnificently.

The final episode was especially valuable because it helped viewers not just witness but also make sense of the American Jewish experience.

3012950,5,B000Y7U9A0,"I viewed the full six hours of this wonderfully rendered series on PBS.  It provides an excellent, moving history of the American Jews, their changing culture, and their important contributions to American society.  The series explores this by bringing to light personal stories of many individuals and families.  It does this by incorporating beautiful graphics, music and interviews with famous American Jews and their descendants.

The series answered a lot of questions I had about Jewish American history.  Viewers of all faiths and nationalities should find it appealing and educational.",1201305600,26,593,5.544444444444444

Caveat:  I am Jewish and I grew up post-WWII with parents who were children prior to WWII.  This presentation gave me a background I needed; it filled in a lot of holes in my understanding of what my parents life was like and what was the context that I was raised in.  It also has beautiful music, and graphics are used extremely well.  But, CAUTION:  I have no idea how well this collection will be received by people for whom the information is NOT so personal.  Will this interest you if you did not live it?  Perhaps.",1201219200,45,624,4.4035087719298245

From Ruth Bader Ginsberg to Sid Caesar; from the first Jewish immigrants to contemporary Jewish life; from the Holocust to Jewish humour; from Chasidic Judiasm to the Reform movement. I am familiar with much of the material but never before has it been presented in such an informative and entertaining way.

I am a secular Jew married to a Shiksa. I have a grandson named Christian. Oi veh! I am ordering this DVD so that my grown sons and eventually mein yingele can fully understand their heritage.

It was quite interesting to discover that the nursing profession was invented by a Jewish woman in New York.  There are very fascinating facts throught this piece.

8231142,5,B000Y7U9A0,"First I must state that I am not Jewish. I saw this documentary on PBS several years ago and loved it. I bought this as a gift for someone but this is one of the better in depth histories of the American Jew.  I learned so much from this and it answered so many prejudices I had before watching it.  Knowledge about other cultures and traditions is key to understanding those different from us.  It is through ignorance that we remain a bigot and allow hate to fester.  I highly recommend this for anyone who enjoys history, whether it is to learn about your ancestors or just to understand this great nation that is a melting pot of people from all walks of life. It will give you a new respect for those who proudly call themselves a Jew.",1489708800,4,740,4.302158273381295
