8384456,5,B002YZL8GY,"I used to play bass for Van and I have watched him grow into the virtuoso perfomer he is today.  He has all the licks and is a creative songwriter.  Texas Rock ""n"" Roll and Blues lives on with guys like Van reminding us of why we are Texans for life no matter where we stand.",1334275200,,275,3.892857142857143
