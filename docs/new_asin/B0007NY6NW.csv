8049427,3,B0007NY6NW,"...of course not real Biography, contains some fictional scenes like to composing of the ""Vienna Tales..."".

Miliza Korjus is just fantastic with a incredible singing voice. Luise Rainer acting also great.

The Camera-Work / ball scene is amazing and inspired later a scene for ""Dallas"" in a episode where is playing in Vienna and J.R. and Bobby are dancing at the ball.

Sadly this movie isn't released yet official by MGM or Warner Bros. on DVD. This Russian DVD contains english soundtrack but no subtitles. The Picture quality isn't the best but ok and watchable.

Fazit: movie is great, DVD is just ok - could be done better",1307491200,,629,4.796296296296297
8049428,5,B0007NY6NW,Julien Duvivier played hard with this biography of the legend of Waltz: Johann Strauss. A film without age; for all music lovers of the most popular genre in what classical music concerns. Luise Rainer is perfect in her role.,1130457600,5,225,4.794871794871795
8049429,5,B0007NY6NW,"A froth of beautiful music, MGM direction and a very silly story. Great fun when you are in the right mood. Unfortunately another nail in the coffin of Louise Rainer's brief career.

 If you like high coloratura voices you should love the singing of Militzia Korjus. Very brief film career, one American film. Ferdinand Gravet is not much of a romantic lead. Huge cast of MGM stock players.",1116892800,6,390,4.720588235294118
