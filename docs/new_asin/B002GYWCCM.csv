8370103,3,B002GYWCCM,"This video is the same as A&E ancient mysteries withes with leonard nemoy,except with a different narrator. I took the time to look at the product numbers and running time and release date to make sure I did not get the video I already owned, but its the same. The video is good and informative. But I feel like they pulled a fast one on me and I wasted $30. They put it out there as a different product, shame on ya'll.",1382054400,,420,4.134146341463414
