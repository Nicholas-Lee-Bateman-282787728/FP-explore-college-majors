7897184,5,6305901430,"I first saw this movie when it opened in NY in the 80's, just watched again on Netflix and after a fast and furious search, found it on Amazon and got it for my personal collection. Based on a real life murder, this film helped rally support for the young murderer from Greeks of all walks of life, including Melina Mercouri.  It may hurt today's politically correct gay sensibilities, but the fact is that it broke new ground in terms of Greek cinematography, and opened up a discussion on gays as victims rather than predators.",1245542400,5,529,4.568421052631579
