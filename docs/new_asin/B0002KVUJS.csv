2102192,5,B0002KVUJS,great additon to my dvd collection saw this movie many years ago and have been looking to own it for a very long time  i am very pleased with this product  thank you,1210291200,,165,3.9696969696969697
2102193,3,B0002KVUJS,"Much as has already been described.  One doesn't view this film for the plot, nor the acting, but rather for the appearance of nubile young and not so young women in various stages of undress.",1191456000,7,192,4.485714285714286
2102194,3,B0002KVUJS,"Truthfully, the main reason I keep _The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova_ in my DVD library (actually, I re-added it this spring after having sold it off last year) is because of all the Euro-beauties who doff their clothes in this film - Britt Ekland, Marisa Berenson, Sylva Koscina, et al. If it weren't for them, I'd frankly find this film rather dull.  As it is, it's more plodding than a movie about Casanova's life ought to be.  But just when I get bored, a new beauty falls into Casanova's life and bed and out of her clothes, so I keep watching.  And so it goes...",1186617600,17,574,4.447619047619048
2102195,2,B0002KVUJS,"Amusing film, not as funny as when I first saw it some 20yrs ago. Very poor lip synchronisation.",1169164800,,96,4.388888888888889
2102196,5,B0002KVUJS,"Tony Curtis stars in this very sexy comedy romp through the boudoirs of old Venice.

Britt Ekland, Marisa Berenson, Sylva Koscina and a bevy of other beauties all have a devil of a time keeping their clothes on in ""The Amorous Mis-Adventures of Casanova"".

Great Mature Fun!!!",1094774400,11,276,4.851063829787234

8028715,3,B0002KVUJS,Could've been much better. Plot is artificially goofy and doesn't use the talents of Tony Curtis.,1522195200,,97,5.125

8028718,2,B0002KVUJS,I like this movie and I bought the dvd but unfortunately it has very bad quality. This way it is a bit disappointing.,1394582400,2,117,4.130434782608695
8028719,1,B0002KVUJS,"This is a terrible film.  I think Tony Curtis made it only because he was paid a lot and because he got to work with many nude women.

As far as I'm concerned, the only redeeming value to this movie is the nude women, of which there are many.

The plot is silly, the acting is atrocious, but the women are lovely.",1346371200,2,313,4.016129032258065
8028720,4,B0002KVUJS,"Well, if you like a flick that has lots of T and A with bawdy, and at times, sophmoric humor ala Benny Hill then this butt's for you. (And friends that poor pun is indeed an indication of the level of humor in this film.) However, I wasn't expecting anything more and so I was satisfied -- this being similar to some of  the Seduction Cinema fodder you might watch -- you don't watch it for cinematic excellence.
  Why Tony Curtis chose to play the lead in this is beyond me. Judging from the way he plays the character I assume he laughed all the way to the bank. He does seem to be having fun but then why wouldn't he, surrounded by more babes than you can shake a schtick at. The plot is a just an excuse for jokes and bare skin so if you expect to learn a single thing about the life of Casanova, forget it. Historical, it ain't.
  Still I gave it 4 stars because it was just what it proposed to be, a buxom, oversexed send up that was designed to appeal to prurient interests -- and it certainly appealed to mine. Then again, I like Benny Hill so what do I know. As the man once said ""I know what I like.""",1268006400,10,1110,4.050228310502283
8028721,5,B0002KVUJS,"Well costumed, hilarious, a comic story line plus stars one doesn't expect to be this naked on camera. A truly unique show from these actors & stunning actresses, from the peak of their careers. If you don't enjoy nudity skip this one.",1264032000,5,235,4.619047619047619
8028722,4,B0002KVUJS,"Tony Curtis, may he R.I.P., was one of my mother's favorite actors, and I also enjoyed watching his films when I was a child.  This is one which, due to its mature content, my mother and I did not watch together, but I have found it so humorous that I have watched it several times.  Besides being a vehicle for Tony Curtis in a dual role, it also serves as a showcase for Marisa Berenson.",1238544000,6,389,4.173333333333333
8028723,2,B0002KVUJS,"The dvd arrived on time and undamaged. However, the video quality of the dvd was very bad. This dvd in my opinion is a copy and not an original. I do not recommend buying this dvd from this source.",1211673600,2,197,4.076923076923077
