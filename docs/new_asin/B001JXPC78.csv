3661214,4,B001JXPC78,"Season Two is not as good as season one but hold on, as this show is just hitting its stride so that by season three it is terrific. This season presents a very good serial murder story but it doesn't do anything gound breaking yet. The serial murderer is very clever.  He has his wife cover for him, his girlfriend, his child, a retarded man and two brothers.  Our detectives are able to press his prosecution after he mistakenly leaves one victim alive. However with all the covering up by all of these other people it is an up hill battle. There is more courtroom aspect to this one than any of the others and some are going to find that a little tedious after awhile.  There is a dynamite resolution, however, so hang in there.

3661215,5,B001JXPC78,"Each and every Trial & Retribution is a classic, a masterpiece. I am anxiously awaiting the upcoming latest set being released June 15 on Amazon. I love the character studies, the twists, the turns, the personalities. Once you start watching, you will be hooked. I am.",1275696000,,268,4.8478260869565215
3661216,5,B001JXPC78,"This is not a mere sedate version of ""Law and Order"" or ""CSI,"" although the general tenor is similar.

From Britain comes this saga of crime investigation and court trial of prime suspects.  The stories open after discovery of a body or its member part.  Slow, tedious and, at times fruitless, investigation follows. Forensics weigh in as also plain gum shoe grunt work.  The lawyers take over once a case is brought in to the courts. While all this seems familiar to us, fed on years of Law & Order or CSI, ""Trial & Retribution"" is much more than just a stretched out transatlantic version.  There is ample time for development of suspicions, hints, misdirected leads, disappointments and victories.

The pace is slow enough to taste the nuances, learn to love or hate the personalities, test our own theories and simply enjoy the conversational subtleties. Access to the latest high-tech equipment is neither assured nor easy, civility calls for a soft touch during questioning, and  love and hatred are not compressed into 30 second snippets. Their courtroom dramatics are not temper tantrums but a delightful coda that mixes rapier thrusts of wit and gracious concessions.

Lt. Columbo and Ben Matlock would be our closest counterparts who will match the leading characters from ""Trial & Retribution."" The crimes are the same -murder, distortion, lust and greed, its perpetrators are just as pathological as ours, and the consequences are also similar. The face of deviancy is no different across the pond. We hear the Brits tell their tales in a voice that is some times a refreshing contrast to what Hollywood has habituated us. Familiarity with the actors or British penal system is not at all a requirement to enjoy this series. I must hurry to mention that I have not watched the other sets than this one; therefore immunity against ennui is not a guarantee.

Each episode is almost 3 hours long. Abandon your hurries and allow the drama, words and actions take you on a less traveled journey",1275091200,,2001,4.896449704142012

8313953,5,B001JXPC78,"They compare this to law and order.... but I say it is ""Criminal Minds"" mixed with Law and Order.  Why the PBS stations do not have this on their schedule is their loss.  They are finding out the British shows are their bread and butter but don't bring the tried and true to our televisions for viewing. Some scenes are very graphic, but does not take away from the quality of the show.  Personally, if you are comparing this to the Law and Order in recent years.... there is no comparison.  This is much, much, much better.  That's how I feel and I now have all the Episodes....",1398297600,,579,4.324074074074074

8313955,3,B001JXPC78,It was o.k. I would not recommend it  I thought it was too brutal and the murder scenes too gory.,1353456000,,97,3.85
8313956,5,B001JXPC78,"BBC does it again. EVERY season was sensational. US commercial television should get hints in how to do a show the right way. BBC is RAW at times,but it tells a story.",1350691200,2,167,4.25
8313957,3,B001JXPC78,"To be fair, I've only watched this through Series 3.  Perhaps the show runners decided to take a bit more effort in coming up with their plot twists, but I doubt it.  So far I have seen jaw-dropping moments of profound stupidity normally reserved for slasher-movies.  I think that's the reason why ""T&R"" has such short series (2 eps - 1hr 40 min each), there's no way people this inept could close more than two cases a year.  This show is a nice queue filler, good enough to watch via your subscribed service, but if you pay anything more to view it YOU will be looking for justice.  Really, ITV couldn't spend any more money on the truly excellent ""Wire in the Blood"" but they commissioned another series of THIS?  BTW, Amazon should try to clarify just what is in these ""sets"". Is it one series or two?",1327881600,,805,4.405405405405405
