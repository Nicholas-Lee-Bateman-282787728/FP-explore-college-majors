1958696,3,B0000YAEG6,"I thought this series of videos would be a nice ""change of pace"" from Baby Einstein for my 8 month old, but he gets very upset everytime the puppet shows come on.  I think that an 8 month old, cognitively, could not understand the humor of the puppet shows, and they last way too long to be making no sense. It's silly to be using puns and jokes for this age group!  The Baby Einstein puppets are more captivating because they utilize motion and colors. My son actually cries every time Dee, Ed, and Ta (of this video) show their face. He equally dislikes Baby Day and Nature Baby (I hope I get the names correct).  Perhaps he will grow to appreciate this video when he is a little older, but it's not great for a small baby.",1095984000,4,725,4.239130434782608
1958697,2,B0000YAEG6,"I was really attracted to the ""musical"" aspect of this video but for some reason it fails to capture the interest of my 1 year old.  Also I find the music a bit irritating and I've definitely heard my fair share of toy box type music through other videos.",1093910400,2,255,4.204081632653061
1958698,5,B0000YAEG6,"My son loves this video, and is actually watching it with his Daddy right now. At first, I didn't like it for some reason, but now I do. I love the diversity of the images, as well as the ethnicity of the children and parents shown on screen. I also enjoy that they have real Dads with their babies too, not only Mommies like other videos.
My son is 7 months old and almost does not even blink while watching the whole thing. He loves the puppets and the music.
I recommend it, and bought it for $9.99 at Walmart-actually my DVD came with a special discount of $5.00 if I purchase the Baby's Day DVD as well, which I will next week! So I will have 2 DVDs for the price of one Baby Einstein...can't beat that!",1082851200,,708,4.13768115942029
1958699,5,B0000YAEG6,"We were loyal consumers of Baby Einstein (BE)and decided to try this video for a change. Yes, it's different than BE and it may take two to three viewings to appreciate. The puppets are great and no they are not on the video the entire time. What makes this video better than the BE ones in my opinion is that they feature parents and children of all ages and ethnicities doing things instead of just showing toys jumping in an out of the screen like the BE videos. My sons, ages one and three, love it and really enjoy watching the other children. They imitate what the children do and have gained, especially the 3 year old, an appreciation for different muscial instruments. The children playing the instruments on the video are quite talented and this alone is to be appreciated by anyone.",1082592000,,793,4.5524475524475525
1958700,5,B0000YAEG6,"I bought this DVD, along with the Fisher Price ""baby's day"" DVD for my nieces and nephew aged 1 to 41/2. The babies are mesmerized in watching the other children interacting on the screen, and they laugh and clap in joy; my older niece loves to see the children playing the musical instruments and wants to watch over and over again! Thank you for making me the most popular aunt in the world!",1081209600,,393,4.397260273972603
1958701,5,B0000YAEG6,We were given Musical Baby as a gift and I can't believe how much my 6 month old loves it. I guess all kids are different but mine is totally captivated by the this video. The selection of music is superb and the visuals are catchy. My baby and I both love this one and I think Fisher Price did a great job.,1079568000,,307,3.888888888888889
1958702,4,B0000YAEG6,"We bought this video because we went away and didn't have our Baby Einstein videos with us.  The first time we watched it, we thought it was AWFUL and our 10 month old didn't seem very interested.  However, the next time she watched it, she was completely engaged by the first half of the video and some of the scenes were growing on us a little.  By the tenth viewing, we were all singing the stupid songs and making fun of the stupid scenes, but our ten month old was completely engrossed in all but a few of the sequences.  This video enabled me to leave my little separation anxiety sufferer with a babysitter without so much as a peep of protest!",1077494400,,651,4.311475409836065
1958703,5,B0000YAEG6,"really good videa and I love the special additions, the little people extra is awesome.  My son really enjoys watching these and I like because there is only positive non violent material.",1283212800,,188,4.875
1958704,4,B0000YAEG6,"We only have this Musical Baby DVD so far but the kids love it. The puppets are definitely the stars, but the program is well put-together and actually teaches the kids (from baby to preschool) useful things. The musical performances featured are uneven in quality, from very good (the singing boy) to very bad (the three violin players). Of all the baby DVDs we bought this is among the best. I also recommend the Fisher-Price Little People claymations, now out-of-print but still available from third-party sellers.",1257638400,,517,5.023255813953488
1958705,5,B0000YAEG6,"We really like this series.  My little one was really engaged.  Disappointed that they are no longer creating new episodes and discontinuing them all together.  Seems like the good/interesting baby items never stick around long.  Pity...they're great baby shower gifts, if you can find them.",1257120000,,291,5.4
1958706,4,B0000YAEG6,"The only reason for 4 starts is that my 4-month old keeps on loosing attention when they show singers on this DVD. But puppets, nature, and baby scenes are all great here as always..",1243296000,,182,4.382352941176471
1958707,5,B0000YAEG6,This is my daughter's favorite dvd.  We bought it at about 4 months and she's been watching ever since (13 months now).  We tried the other fisher price videos but this one is the best by far.  It has been a life saver...the only thing to calm her down when she is really upset or cranky!!,1237593600,,289,4.125
1958708,3,B0000YAEG6,It's a great DVD for older kids. My 19 month old was not too impressed.,1203465600,,71,3.8
1958709,5,B0000YAEG6,"We bought this whole series (Baby's Day, Musical Baby, Baby Moves and Nature Baby) after hearing wonderful things about it from friends when my son (now 3 years old) was an infant.  He loved every one of them!  Now we have a 5 month old daughter and she has been watching them since she was about 3 1/2 months old. Her eyes light up and she begins to coo and kick her legs with excitement when she hears the ""intro"" music to the DVDs.  Although she enjoys watching and hearing the babies interact with their parents, she squeals with delight when Ta, Dee and Ed come on the screen for their skits.",1200614400,,597,4.3125
1958710,3,B0000YAEG6,"I bought this DVD for my daughter after reading reviews raving about how good it is. My 1-year-old daughter enjoys the ""Baby Genius"" series because of all the singing, dancing, & children interaction in the video & I thought that this would be similiar. I was wrong. This video contains songs & interactions but they seem a bit too mellow. My daughter was into it for about 5 minutes watching the parents & babies interacting but soon lost interest.

I guess if your babies love listening to classical music, talking or soft songs & just people/baby watching than they might enjoy this. This is not the case for my girl so that's why I'm giving it 3 stars only.",1192752000,,661,4.554621848739496
1958711,5,B0000YAEG6,"We received Baby Moves as a gift from my mother. Boy, she knows how to pick out baby items. My daughter started watching it around 9 mos and at 15 mos she is still glued to the tv whenever I put it on. I actually can get a whole 40min to do whatever I need to do; read over documents, clean, cook, relax-she's fine!
Nature Baby in the series for some reason doesn't entertain her as much. She'll get up and refocus on something.
Baby's Day is very good. She'll request to watch that one.
Music Baby I think is her favorite. She giggles all the time to it.

Her favorite character is ED the frog. I wish I could find some toys or a stuffed animal of him... hmmmm..",1189728000,,663,4.1
1958712,5,B0000YAEG6,"We actually have all 4 - Musical Baby, Baby's Day, Baby Moves, and Nature Baby.  They are ALL wonderful!  Our 2 year old just ""loves"" Ed.  She hardly ever stays still for very long, but if I put one of these videos on for her she usually will stay in one place and watch.  She likes to ""sing"" along with the puppets.  I would recommend this collection to others or give them as a gift.",1184803200,,385,4.08
1958720,5,B0000YAEG6,"All of the Fisher Price videos are fun for babies - even up to two years old.  A nice switch from the Baby Einstein, Barnie, Wiggles... fun music that doesn't get stuck in your head. Great video clips and cute puppets.",1173312000,4,218,4.317073170731708
1958721,5,B0000YAEG6,"We tried this DVD out when my baby was 2 and 1/2 months old. We noticed she would watch TV with us at times and thought - why not pop in the DVD that had been sitting unopened on the table. From the moment the DVD began she was totally mesmerised. After watching it a few times over the next few days she really began to squeal with delight, smile at the babies (especially towards the beginning) and anticipate Ta De and Ed - the puppets - enterance, kicking her feet. Now at 5 1/2 months when I tell her that we are going to watch ""musical baby"" using the same intonation as the puppets, her face really lights up.

I think this DVD works so well because for once not only do you see the babies and their parents , but you HEAR them laugh, cry out and make all sorts of baby sounds - even while the music is playing. This is what makes the DVD unique. My baby reacts to the other babies and the DVD is a delight to watch. I wish there were more baby DVDs were of such good quality, and entertaining.",1158105600,5,1001,4.055555555555555
1958722,5,B0000YAEG6,"My daughter, 16 months, loves this video and most importantly has learnt a lot with it. Now she has signs for most instruments and is trying to sing along the songs.

I think this video is great and much better than baby einstein because it combines very well images of babies and children, parents, nature, toy instruments and real ones.",1152144000,2,338,4.633333333333334
1958723,5,B0000YAEG6,"My ten month old daughter received ""Musical Baby"" for Christmas and she has been watching it almost daily since then.  She sees me headed to the TV and I can sense her anticipation.  If another movie comes on she looks at me like I made a mistake.

She watches it happily from start to finish.  During some sequences she just stares at the screen with a smile on her face and other times she starts clapping and playing along.  She loves the puppets and the other babies.  Her favorite sequence is about drums.  She likes bouncing to the music.  If she is fussy and nothing else works I know that this will.  It calms her down and puts her in a much better mood almost instantly.

I had another DVD that was meant for babies that was much lower quality and didn't entertain her very much.  That one had toys moving to music much like the Baby Einstein DVDs I have seen.  My daughter just ignored it.

I am buying the rest of the Fisher Price series now.  I am pretty sure she will like them and if not at least I didn't spend as much money as I would on Baby Einstein.",1139702400,5,1068,4.197044334975369
1958724,5,B0000YAEG6,"i rented this dvd at the local library, along with the award winning Hap Palmer ""baby songs"".  my 14 month old who loves baby einstein, and anything with babies, puppets or music, hated the praised hap palmer dvd, but absolutely loved the fischer price dvd.  she squeeled every time the puppets came and danced when the music came on.  i cant wait to buy this dvd to have for her to watch more.  thank you.",1134518400,,406,4.373333333333333
1958725,3,B0000YAEG6,"My one year old LOVES Baby Moves and Baby's Day, but she won't watch this one...I think it's not as simple to understand and clear as the others, harder to follow for a baby.",1128038400,,174,4.147058823529412
1958726,5,B0000YAEG6,My son has been watching this video since he was 3 months old. He LOVES it!!!  Smiles a LOT when it is on. More than the Einstein videos. I'm ordering the whole series:),1121040000,,169,4.121212121212121
1958727,5,B0000YAEG6,"My 8 month old loves this DVD and my husband and I do, too.  We have 14 of the Baby Einstein DVDs but this is the one we all favor.  Smart, fun, I really can't say enough about it.  I just ordered the other DVDs in this series (Baby Moves and Nature Baby)--my daughter is not as pleased with them as this one.  Love the puppets:  Ta, De and Ed.  Worth the money.",1102982400,,362,3.8904109589041096
1958728,5,B0000YAEG6,"i am a baby sitter.  i love to bring this movie to houses when i babysit because when i have no idea what they want or what they are trying to say while they are crying i just stick this in and the instantly calm down and start watching this.  my family brings it on car long car drives too, it keeps both my baby brothers quiet the whole ride.",1102636800,,344,3.9
1958729,5,B0000YAEG6,"My six month old has been watching this video since 4 months old.  He absolutely LOVES it!  The entire Fisher Price series (Musical Baby, Baby's Day, Nature Baby and Baby Moves) are great because they show close-ups of babies and little ones doing different activities...I find my son loves watching people's faces and looking at expressions.  They also are ""hosted"" by three puppets - Ta, Dee and Ed.  They are so cute and my son LOVES them!  I would definitely recommend this video for baby!",1098144000,3,493,4.752941176470588
8004329,5,B0000YAEG6,"My daughter likes this one a lot.  Don't know much about music theory myself, but it kind of breaks down rhythm and melodies in a nice way.",1476057600,,139,4.148148148148148
8004330,5,B0000YAEG6,"This video has been a hit with all my grandchildren from the time they are sitting up well into their toddler years.  They love the music, the puppets and seeing other children.  Even my pre-teen grandchildren still quote some of the phrases. I have bought it as a baby gift many times and would recommend it to any new mother or grandmother!",1465084800,,342,4.5
8004331,5,B0000YAEG6,happy with this movie(my 15 month old toddler loves it).,1406678400,,56,4.7
8004332,5,B0000YAEG6,"We purchased this for our son when he was about 10 months old. He had always ignored the TV (for the few times we had it on around him), but he definitely paid attention to this video. We sat him down in his little chair, and he became absolutely transfixed for about 15 minutes.
He is now 13 months old, and he still loves the first half of the program. He tends to lose interest whenever the nature scenes come on. Anything that can keep our son's attention for more than 2 minutes is a keeper!
As an adult, the DVD is pleasant. The music is enjoyable, the puppets are fun, and the scenes of babies playing with musical instruments could potentially help our son become interested in music.",1383868800,,692,4.372093023255814
8004333,5,B0000YAEG6,I got this for my first baby who is now 10 years old.  Our family is very musical so this is a big hit!  I can actually endure listening to this DVD 3 times in a row :)  It's fun to hear my children harmonize with the animals.,1381795200,,226,3.6666666666666665
8004334,5,B0000YAEG6,It's great for seating in the rocking chair with the baby. I got it for myself and I absolutely loved it. My baby is grown now so I gave it to friends whoes baby loves it too.,1368489600,,175,3.7567567567567566
8004335,5,B0000YAEG6,"My son is now 14 months and enjoys Ta De and Ed so much! I will admit that when we began to show him these videos (6 months old) he would become upset when seeing the puppets, but now he concentrates and is very entertained by the video. I wish they had more Ta De and Ed products and videos. My son also enjoys watching the Little People Episodes and the parent learning tools.",1348099200,,378,4.121621621621622
8004336,5,B0000YAEG6,"My child, now 9 yrs, used to listen to it over and over. It was her favorite. I get emotional when I see it again.",1335225600,,114,3.6
8004337,5,B0000YAEG6,"I bought this for my son when he was about three months old and he still loves it now that he is 16 months!  He will grab the movie from the shelf and bring it to me to put in, or if I just put it on when he hears the fisher price logo come on he starts jumping and laughing.  I have tried Baby Einstien and other movies and was sorely disappointed and after watching them my husband told me to get rid of them.  Half of the words are in a different lanugage if he can't speak english why would we teach him french or spanish? We love this video because its simple and the characters Ta Dee and Ed use words that he is trying to learn and never to much at a time.  Everyone should try this out!",1290124800,,694,3.8661971830985915
8004338,5,B0000YAEG6,I have a one year old who is EXTREAMLY active and high strung.  I put this dvd on and for the first time since he began crawling he actually stopped and paid attention to what was going on around him. I love this dvd. He loves the music and the characters. Not too bad on the irritation scale either as far as the adults go.,1286496000,,324,3.9846153846153847
