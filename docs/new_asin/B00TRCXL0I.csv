8702938,5,B00TRCXL0I,Finally a Blu Ray version of Andrei Tarkovsky' s Andrei Rublev what took Criterion too long.,1529971200,4,92,4.8125
8702939,3,B00TRCXL0I,"This particular copy is made from a Russian blu ray with eng subs, this is Not an original copy. The transfer is good, but not the uncut version of the film. For those who want the uncut original we will have to wait. I'm surprised Amazon is selling burned blurays for this much, even the cover art looks like it was printed at home.",1521849600,8,333,4.21875
8702940,5,B00TRCXL0I,"I don't say this often: this is a movie that has to be seen on a big screen in a cinema. Given that such is impossible over 99% of the time, this Blu-Ray offering is the best you can do.

Consider this: it's a film called ANDREI RUBLEV that has little to do with the historical figure of Andrei Rublev. There are many scenes in which he is completelyor almost completelyabsent. That really doesn't matter. It's a movie that paints a portrait of the Middle Ages in Russia. It includes the foolhardy endeavors of man to fly, the diabolic attempts of woman to embrace the numinous, and the ambition of a young man to cast a bell. Somewhere in the mix is the story of a monk who merely wants to change the color palette of Orthodox iconography. That monk is Rublev.

The ending is glorious, if you are lucky enough to see it on a big screen. Otherwise, it will make you bow in shame at the inadequacy of your home theatre, no matter how much you have splurged on it.

Still and all, don't think of missing this. Even if you have a DVD of this movie, go immediately and throw it away. Buy the Blu-Ray. (Plays beautifully in Region 1; forget the Cyrillic lettering on the box.) This is the most crucial Tarkovsky to see in high definition, but you still owe it to yourself to acquire any other of his films available in hi-def.",1447891200,16,1321,4.318548387096774
