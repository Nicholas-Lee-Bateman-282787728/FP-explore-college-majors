6602116,5,B002YWMJ4W,"After the St. Anger fiasco, Metallica returns with a vengeance.  I knew as good as the Death Magnetic was and as good as the tour was, a DVD was likely.  After all they hadn't released anything since Cunning Stunts.  Well, I was almost right.  They released a DVD in Central/South America, and in France.  It is awesome. As good as Binge and Purge and Stunts.  If you don't mind spending some bucks, there is a 2CD-2DVD set available.",1261612800,4,434,4.5
6602117,5,B002YWMJ4W,This show is excellent.  The sound is excellent and yes you get Dts 5.1 and the way that the cameras are used are just amazing.  YOu almost feel as if you were there and the cameras show just how big the arena is.  A lot of the material is old school and it sounds as metal hard as it ever has.  Metallica just seem to get better as they grow older.  The energy that was sent back and forth is amazing.  I have seen many Metalica shows on Dvd over the years and this is there best yet.,1260921600,16,485,3.8979591836734695
6602118,3,B002YWMJ4W,I think the video was okay I think they should release earlier material floating around the web because I believe that James has lost his voice therefore I like the earlier Metallica,1376352000,,182,4.71875

6602120,5,B002YWMJ4W,One of the best live videos of the last decade. Metallica still has the chops to make a live show memorable. The set list includes many old classics mixed with newer cuts performed masterfully (except for Lars drumming which gets lazier as he gets older). A must for any fan of hard rock and heavy metal.,1350864000,,304,4.446428571428571
6602121,5,B002YWMJ4W,"I'm a casual Metallica fan as they are on the hard edge of my musical taste. I bought his dvd not expecting too much. The day I watched it had been one of the most stressful days I have ever had at work. I was wired to the teeth with stress. I stuck this dvd into the player & 2.5 hours(& 3 drinks)later life was not only good it was great! This stuff is musical valium. Stress melts away as this great band pounds out their stuff. Well done & a great show in front of 50,000 Mexicans. I didn't mind the format(several songs, then a brief interview(in Spanish, I didn't have subtitles on so I have no idea what they were saying, probably Metallica's great!)Hardcore fans might consider the 4 disc set(2dvd/2cd), but it's way more expensive. No regrets on this purchase & it will be watched again soon( an honour only a few discs get)",1333152000,,833,4.312101910828026
6602122,5,B002YWMJ4W,"Being a Metallica fan, this DVD satiates my appetite!
The set is great,  and they obviously have lots of energy. The crowd is also great, and very loud! The quality is good, and camera work is also very professional. Great purchase :)",1309478400,,234,4.571428571428571
6602123,3,B002YWMJ4W,"Probably one of the best sets I have seen Metallica play...but whoever gave the monkeys that shot this cameras, should be shot! The camera's are more on the crowd then the band,a lot of the show is out of focus,in 'Broken, Beat &,Scarred', I think the camera is on Hetfield for maybe four words during the whole song which is really disappointing when you consider he is called a ""Front man"" or ""LEAD Singer"" for a reason so you would think that he would deserve the respect of being filmed while singing. As great as it is and as difficult as it can be to capture a live show, and as much as there is a want and need to capture and see what the band is doing as a whole, you get the feeling that the predominant camera person had a Lars fetish with the camera being on him so much of the time that it is annoying, and as much as I love him he is not that interesting to watch ALL the time and there are three other members in the band!! The camera could stay on Kirk when he's doing a solo for example...don't know...maybe not so hard to get right!

As much as it is great to try and capture the experience of being there, I am sure that the people that were there weren't watching the rest of the people around them singing the songs, they were looking to James Hetfield to sing them, but we see the crowd sing more than he does! Not to mention the Mexican fan footage and as great as it is to see the band interviewed, it does take away from the concert when the dvd cuts to all that footage in between songs which could have just been included as ""extras"" maybe on the discs.

All in all when you look at how well shot the ""Francois Pour Nuit"" concert is, you still feel like what it must have been like to be there, but respect is given and focus on each band member without feeling like the camera men are on speed!!

I have everything Metallica, and this is the ONLY time have been disappointed with a release from them!

As a fan, you gotta have it, but once again, such a shame considering there are such great sets the boys played.

6602124,5,B002YWMJ4W,i was blown away by this concert. these guys show you how it should be done the extras just blew mw away how they took the time to talk with fans and sign so many autographs. plus it was a rocking show. really a great disk to have.,1304812800,,231,3.8333333333333335
6602125,5,B002YWMJ4W,"This is a double layer DVD. It means around 9 GB of A/V high quality.
Amazing concert, with interviews. One of the best concerts I've ever seen.",1301616000,,144,4.37037037037037
6602126,5,B002YWMJ4W,"I've been a fan of Metallica's early music for a long time, like many others, and passionate especially about the glory of Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets.  However, Metallica seemed very early on at the beginning of their success to lapse into the ""rock star"" mentality, and while they kept it pretty tight when I saw them open for Ozzy in 1986, by the black album their live performance here in Tucson had lapsed into sloppier versions of their songs, long drawn out stage antics, and similar attitude.  With poorer albums and bizarre affectations (the latter half of the Metallica Videos DVD, starting with Load, is nothing short of jarring)the band finally worked themselves back into decent musical shape with Death Magnetic, a respectable return to form (if marred by distorted production).

So, all that being said, I'm far from a Metallica apologist, but decided to check out this video as I began collecting metal DVD's as a way of experience another dimension to the music I love.  (Megadeth's recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rust-In-Peace-Live/dp/B003TN920O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rust In Peace (Live)</a>&nbsp;is also excellent, and just as redemptive and inspirational.)  Watching this video, it was as if suddenly Metallica did everything right again, and every aspect of the DVD production, the performance, and the music was suddenly inspirational.  To paraphrase my friend, Metallica never seemed as sincere, gracious, and likable as they did during this performance, where all the band members seemed like they loved the fans, loved being there, loved playing the music, and had a great time.  The music was so much tighter and focused than it had been in other performances, spanning a tremendous amount of their catalog and with thoughtful and unexpected depth with some of the songs they pulled out.  Interspersed with the fans in Mexico to break things up, it was just a DVD that was thrilling, exciting, and inspiring to watch.",1300924800,,2013,5.388535031847134
6602127,4,B002YWMJ4W,"Pretty good sound quality with a relatively diverse setlist including plenty of old gems not on the radio.  More interviews with fans than I'd care for, but that's what the skip button is for.  Great show overall.",1296000000,3,213,4.72972972972973
6602128,5,B002YWMJ4W,"CONCERT WAS REALLY GOOD. THE ONLY BAD THING WAS THE FIREWORKS.. IT SOUNDED LIKE CRAP WHEN THEY WENT OFF. BUT, OVERALL A 5 STAR ... DEFINITELY RECOMMEND IT !!!",1285545600,,158,4.482758620689655
6602129,5,B002YWMJ4W,"I recently viewed this DVD and I don't think the sound is bad; of course, if you have surround sound, it'd be a lot better, like being there. Metallica is one of the best bands ever and they prove it when they give everything on stage, and this time wasn't the exception. I loved it when Robert spoke Spanish. I absolutely recommend this piece of their history and work.",1281398400,,370,4.3768115942028984
6602130,5,B002YWMJ4W,"First, I am not the biggest Metallica fan. I don't own everything they've ever done. My last purchase before Death Magnetic was the Black album. The in-between years were not kind! I first saw Metallica live on the Ride the Lightning tour with Armored saint and W.A.S.P. in support. It was an awesome show for the few hundred there. We got to meet the band behind the venue afterwards and they were pretty cool. The next time I saw them was opening for Ozzy on the Master Of Puppets tour. Awesome!

OK, back to this DVD. I was impressed enough with the songs on Death Magnetic that I wanted to hear their current set. I found this DVD on Amazon and promptly ordered it. I was not disappointed! The sound quality and picture quality/editing is excellent. Some have complained about the interruptions for band/fan quotes, and while it is not my favorite style of editing, at least they did it right by waiting until the song is completely over before going to it and then it's its own chapter, so it's easy enough to tap ""next"" on the remote to skip it and move on to the next song. The band is in pretty good form, though Lars has really scaled back his kit. James sounds pretty good and Kirk's leads are pretty good as well. The set list is very good. In short, i think this is a must for anyone who likes Metallica music!",1279584000,5,1322,4.373983739837398
6602131,5,B002YWMJ4W,"I didn't think the overall bluray was as good as the Nimes one but it was pretty good. the crappy looking helicopter shots kinda took away from the overall picture quality, but the sound was 5 star. It was a very good bluray to own while waiting for some other better big four bands to release blurays like Slayer, Megadeth, & Anthrax, so I would highly recommend it.",1277337600,2,367,4.411764705882353
6602132,2,B002YWMJ4W,"What a bummer - a great concert spoiled by a mono mix - if you don't have surround sound, I would pass on this DVD until they resolve this problem.  The power of Metallica's sound is dependent on having James in one ear and Kirk in the other, or else it sounds like a lot of mush.  Plus you'll also notice the drums and vocals are really loud like they made the PCM audio out of two the surround tracks.",1275264000,2,403,4.025
6602133,4,B002YWMJ4W,"All right now, James has no longer his killer raspy metallica voice, but the band has never sounded better! Don't get me wrong, I thought the Seattle concert from (binge and purge) was the best, but this concert has the killer sonics that the (binge and purge) concerts only wished for! So, get the others, but enjoy this extreme piece of METAL!!!! It's a loud piece of Metallicda history!!!!",1270080000,,392,4.695652173913044
6602134,5,B002YWMJ4W,Great concert. I think I got my lighter out and waved it around a few times when I watched it. Metallica is great and they really appear to enjoy performing this show and the enery is infectous.,1270080000,6,194,4.27027027027027

6602138,5,B002YWMJ4W,"This is the best Metallica show that I ever seen in my life. I have been at two live shows in Minneapolis, MN and it was way below the energy that this show has. Even when I watch it on my tv it feels more alive than the two shows that I went to. You can see that in all four members of the band that they are having such a great time playing in Mexico. Pay attention to the songs Nothing else matters, a memory remainds, and enter sadman and you will know what I'm talking about.",1267056000,2,480,3.9081632653061225

6602140,5,B002YWMJ4W,Metallica kicks some tail in Mexico. As always a killer live show and a mixed set of old and new. Cheap packaging though. Item was damaged in shipping and it's not even worth the time to send back. I think I'm done with Amazon !,1265846400,,228,4.088888888888889
6602141,4,B002YWMJ4W,The concert was excellent. What I didn't like was the interviews with the public in the middle of the concert. My solution is to ripped the entire concert to the PC and cut off these part.,1265587200,2,188,4.25
6602142,5,B002YWMJ4W,"The audio quality is state-of-the-art, the video quality is unreal, and a great setlist to go with it. The only annoyance is that during the concert they show interview and fan footage.. Which is the only thing I didn't like since I enjoy sitting and listening to the concert portion only. Other than that, it's worth every penny.",1264377600,14,330,4.706896551724138
6602143,4,B002YWMJ4W,"Ok, first the reasons why I'm giving it only 4 stars: Why couldn't they put together a Blu-ray deluxe package? I had to choose between buying the full 2-disc DVD + 2 disc CD version or, if I wanted superior audio and video, go with the 1 disc Blu-ray. I definitely think that's something they should look into for possible future Blu-ray releases. I would have liked the option to get the full 3-day setlist on Blu-Ray. They did the same with the Nimes Blu-Ray of which there is a boxed set version only available on DVD. Again, I opted for the Blu-Ray. Another thing I don't really like about the Mexico Blu-Ray is that they placed interviews/behind the scenes stuff in-between songs instead of having it separately as Special Features like on the Nimes disc. It's annoying if I just want to watch and enjoy the concert for it to be interrupted but little bits of fan or band interviews (all in Spanish, by the way).

The setlist on the Blu-Ray is as follows:

The Ecstasy Of Gold
Creeping Death
For Whom The Bell Tolls
Ride The Lightning
Disposable Heroes
One
Broken, Beat & Scarred
The Memory Remains
Sad But True
The Unforgiven
All Nightmare Long
The Day That Never Comes
Master Of Puppets
Fight Fire With Fire
Nothing Else Matters
Enter Sandman
The Wait
Hit The Lights
Seek & Destroy

Since Metallica played three consecutive shows in Mexico City, the footage is from all three nights combined. I was at the concert on the 4th of June and, again, I wish I could have seen all the songs they played that night on Blu-Ray (Blackened, for example is only available on the 2-disc DVD package). The concert was awesome and this disc is extra special for me since I was there. Audio and Video are great...it's awesome to finally see a Metallica Blu-Ray release. I do think that the Video quality of the Nimes Blu-Ray is slightly better...but that maybe because of the cool venue they played in Nimes. Also, the helicopter footage was clearly not shot in HD as the quality is horrible compared to the rest of the concert footage. BTW...buy both at the Met website instead of here...they're cheaper there even with shipping!",1262995200,38,2121,4.605820105820106
6602144,4,B002YWMJ4W,"The concert in positive:
1. Fantastic Disposable Heroes version. Really Great!!
2. Good energy from metallica and the audience.
3. Pretty good sound -5.1 available- and video.
4. The price is fair enough.

The concert in negative:
1. I don't like almost all the ""new"" metallica's songs (from black album to nowdays). So, they played a few of them.

In general it is a great concert!!!",1262908800,,384,4.803030303030303
6602145,5,B002YWMJ4W,"If you are long time Metallica fan, than you already know when Metallica plays Mexico it is a special experience.  It is amazing environment and they always play multiple nights, which gives a nice platform of song selection...all of this adds up to a great live performance release.  Live Binge and Purge featured Mexico and this DVD/Blu-ray is a welcome addition.  I really appreciated the setlist differing fromthe France show.  I have both shows and I have to say this was my favorite.  What a special place and show.  The crowd is just so intense and it makes the rest of us realize how lucky we are to see Metallica as often as we do...they have to wait so long to see them and they really appreciate it.  We could take a lesson from these fans!

Now to the DVD itself.  I think this is more traditional than the France show, with the cut shots of each band member and a larger stage and pyro for those that care than the France would allow, strictly due to stage size.  The setlist is fantastic on this, atleast I thought so.  Hearing ""Ride the Lightning"", ""Disposable Heroes"", ""Unforgiven"" , ""The Wait"" and the ""Memory Remains"" were worth the purchase of this DVD for me personally.  These are not concert staple songs.  The new songs from Death Magnetic really blend well with the old stuff.  The performance was fantastic, I think Kirk's solos were alot more tight and traditional during this show than France.  The band was really stoked to be there and it shows.  They also interview alot of the Metallica fans and this is always cool to see....an army!  Once and forever, Metallica fans have a connection with each other.  This is a great release and the best concert since the Justice Show released with Binge and Purge.  Thanks guys.

Editing follows the modern trend of fast cuts (unfortunately), but is nowhere near some headache-inducing editings around in other DVDs (Iron Maiden comes to mind). I just wished they did not use so much footage that center on filming the audience. It's boring. I was not there. I don't care. I just wanna watch the show. And the show is the guys on the stage. If I was in a show, I would not spend all the time looking around the audience. I would look at the stage.
