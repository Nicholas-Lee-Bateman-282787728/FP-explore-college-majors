5370337,4,B009WS8UU8,"Personally, I thought it could have been filmed better. The quality of the film is good. Maybe a different way of telling it would have helped! Had a bit of a documentary feel to it. But being based of true accounts. This may have been the best route to take.
Hats off to the two young ladies who played the parts! Real troopers, all and all. I enjoyed it.",1390348800,,356,4.173913043478261
5370338,4,B009WS8UU8,"This is almost as good as it gets. The women aren't fake-boob bimbos. They're both rather average, which makes it more appealing, more gritty, more real. The torture effects are pretty darn good. The restraints, well, mostly good. Cuffed to a wall as shown on the cover, the iron cuffs look like they might actually be effective. A couple of rope scenes, however, less so. The worst is when the Lutheran lesbian lover (as if that's a bad thing) is roped to a metal frame to be roasted over hot coals. Good as far as it goes except for the black and white plastic tape sealing the frayed ends of the knotted ropes. Oops.

This is a disturbing film, not a LOL slasher bit of fun. The violence is very realistic, long and drawn out scenes, and not for the faint of heart. But you can watch it because you know it's not real and the actresses almost pull it off. Almost. Normal women couldn't endure the abuse they endure and, well, about those bits of tape. Still this is not the kind of movie you want to fast-forward through to get to the good bits. The story actually hangs together with the townfolk relating their stories of alleged witchcraft, interspersed with the women being tortured...or is it the other way 'round. Doesn't matter.

4 stars and worth watching again.",1387065600,4,1273,4.530434782608696
5370339,4,B009WS8UU8,"""Maleficarum"" is a film about the Spanish Inquisition as it was practiced in South America (a little known topic compared to the relatively widely-known Inquisition as it was practiced in Spain). This movie was actually shot on location in South America, with a mostly Bolivian cast and crew, and that gives it a certain something that other Inquisition-themed films lack, I think. In addition some research was done in regards to the costumes, which are accurate for the time period.

As far as the content of the film itself? Well, the cover of the DVD gives a good idea of what to expect. History buffs who want some sort of deep exploration of the topic will probably be disappointed, as most of the film's running length is devoted to the film's two stars being shackled naked in a gloomy dungeon and tortured until they confess to their ""crimes"". There's some interviews with various characters to break the monotony, but it's basically a neo-exploitation film. Not that there's anything particularly wrong with that, mind. I actually didn't think that the film's violence was necessarily that graphic or disturbing, and there's nothing particularly lurid about the way the film is shot, no explicit sexuality or pornographic themes, but the almost non-stop parade of full female nudity combined with bondage and torture would probably make this an uncomfortable watch for some. The film's main star Amy Hesketh is a pretty doe-eyed brunette who put quite a bit of effort into selling her performance; her co-star Mila Joya kind of plays second fiddle to her after the first couple rounds of torture but for an completely amateur actress she's not bad. If you're a fan of other Inquisition-themed exploitation films like Paul Naschy's ""Inquisition"", then I'd check this out.",1383523200,4,1780,5.033898305084746
5370340,5,B009WS8UU8,"After watching an interview with Amy Hesketh on YouTube where she talked about this film, I decided to check this one out for myself, this is a very disturbing film, like the Starz miniseries ""Spartucus"", we get to go back in time & witness human nature at its worst, there is no candy-coating our history here, based on actual accounts, we get two women, Amy being one of them, who are arrested by so-called men of God who has them tortured, they are stripped naked & what follows is a series of tortures & floggings, Amy is even put on a rotating rack over some hot coals, when you watch the blooper reel, you know no one was hurt, however, we are given a glimpse into what went on during this time in our history, thousands of women were subjected to this kind of abuse by so-called men of God, the inquisitions were a horrifying reality, it shows how religion can be so corrupted by men who are power hungry, & want to instill fear in others, I give the director credit for not holding back here, the stake burning scene at the end is hard to watch with Amy screaming, however there is a twist at the end that is quite satisfying, I won't spoil it here, my only complaint with this DVD is that it would not play on my DVD player, but did play on my PC DVD player, so I know it plays, but I am not sure it is Region 1, it says all regions & I have others that are all regions & play fine, so if you decide to buy, make sure you have a DVD player on your PC.",1382659200,27,1460,4.090592334494773
5370341,4,B009WS8UU8,"For any folks out there who might have wished that the (typically) brief flashes of inquisitional torture often shown in films depicting medieval witch trial scenarios (such as ""Mark of the Devil""- Stuart Gordon's ""Pit and the Pendulum""-""Goya's Ghosts""- etc.) were longer (and stronger!) ... THIS film is 4 U!

Purportedly based on real witch trial testimonies in South America, back in the day when the Catholic Church was 'doing its' worst' to the females of the realm via trumped up trials for heresy & witchcraft - this 'film' focuses on a particularly sleazy bit of inheritance grabbing by the local clergy.  A recently 'orphaned' young 'heiress' and her female friend are accused by greedy church officials of consorting with the devil and other heretical mis-deeds, and both are 'put to the question' as the torturous interrogations were euphemistically referred to back then.

The director wastes little time in getting the 2 attractive girls into the dungeon and out of their clothes and pretty much the whole 100 min run time of the film is devoted to chronicling the various torments their naked bodies are subjected to in an effort to get them to 'confess', and sign their property over to the Church. The director adopts a bit of a documentary style by interposing quick cuts of various individuals giving 'statements' to the inquisitors about the women 'on trial' but the focus always shifts immediately back to the action in the dungeon so that the basic element of continuity IS the torture. In that regard many of the basic persuasive 'methods' are covered - flogging, branding, stretching, pricking, and 'the Spanish Horse' all get ample screen time.

The production values for the film are fairly decent with some atmospheric location shots in real historic buildings, but there is a bit of an amateurish quality about the whole affair.  The two principal actresses do a good job, though,  of suffering and screaming right up to the climactic burning at the stake scene.  What makes all the nudity & torture somewhat less 'gratuitous' is, of course, the factual historic context and comment upon the corruption of the Church. In focusing so intensely and lingeringly on the abuse of the 2 naked girls this film walks a fine line between being offensively sexploitational and/or historically relevant.  It is to the director's credit that he manages to use the excessive violence and nudity to lend a sense of poignancy and pathos to the proceedings that reinforces the underlying theme of the repugnant abuses against humanity that were carried out, in the name of religion, throughout much of the European world at that point in time.

By its' very nature and topic this is a pretty harsh viewing experience and adults only fare. Full female nudity & graphic brutality abounds but nothing 'pornographic'. Regardless, it certainly gives one their monies worth on the medieval torture front.  The film itself is widescreen format in super sharp digital quality - the extras on the disk are sorta 'hidden' in the Espanol 'language option' of the start-up menu (included are some 'out-takes' from the movie and a 'commentary' track w/ the film's director and 'star' Amy Hasketh) - Spanish language w/ English subtitles.  For what it is - I thot it was well done and would recommend it to those who may enjoy such topics.",1382054400,55,3336,4.971274685816876
5370342,5,B009WS8UU8,"Are you brave as Jac Avila? My admiration grows for Jac Avila's filmmaking with each movie of his that I see, but the first I saw was MALEFICARUM.  Movies about the horrors of the Inquisition have handled the subject from all sorts of angles, from Ken Russell's ""artistic"" THE DEVILS to Jess Franco's THE BLOODY JUDGE. But ""angles"" are not Jac Avila's cup of tea. He goes at the subject straight up the middle, collision course, no turning back, cowards need not apply. Avila based this movie on an historical incident in South America. Hearing a ""witness"" spout historical ""testimony"" that to modern ears is obvious nonsense, then thinking the ""authorities"" cannot possibly take it seriously, THEN seeing the historically accurate results of that testimony--tortures that grow progressively more extreme--drives the point home and then some. Hypocrisy. Injustice. Despair. Young  women heroically defying deranged authority. Hopeless Horror perpetrated by so-called Men of God and condoned by their Church. Avila pulls no punches. And remember, this kind of thing historically went on for hundreds of years, for real! Are you as brave as Jac Avila was in making this film? Only one way to find out.",1381017600,3,1199,5.143589743589744
5370343,4,B009WS8UU8,"Having read a translated copy of the Malleus Maleficarum, I found this to be the most accurate film about the trials of the inquisition.  I feel it outdoes The Pit and the Pendulum as far as historical accuracy, but you can tell that the budget for this film was limited.  Amy Hesketh's performance is the best of anyone in the film and you get to see alot of her...literally.  I did notice that some of the effects were lacking a bit of polish that could cause them to pass as more realistic, but overall it was well done.  I have heard some people complain about the length of some of the torture scenes and the burning scene, mainly that the scenes went longer with the screaming until it became uncomfortable/annoying; however I felt that this conveyed more of a sense of what it would have been like to witness it firsthand.  Not the best movie ever made, but if you have an interest in the Spanish Inquisition you should give this a view.",1374624000,18,944,4.433526011560693
5370344,5,B009WS8UU8,"This is a great film in it's genre. They definitely made an effort at historical realism tho on a limited budget. There is lots of nudity but no embarrassing genital focus. Amy has quite a bit of experience under the name Jane Von Detlefson and is excellent in the torture scenes. The other girl is a relative novice but serviceable. I must admit I'm partial to Amy and would not have bought the film if she were not in it. She is so effective in every torture scene. She is not beautiful but cute in a kind of sisterly way with a decent body. The roast her on a spit scene is a classic. She looks and acts scared and I guess to a certain point she really was. The burn at the stake scene is very well acted tho it's not staged really well but I guess they did what they could. Some have complained that some scenes are too long and that might be true but one can always fast forward. I didn't, I loved all the torture stuff. Guess if we want Amy we're stuck with Jac Avila for the duration. Maybe he makes a passable villain but he puts me in mind of what was said about Robert Mitchum late in his career that his face looked like an old shoe.",1374451200,20,1144,4.088888888888889

On the flip side, there's the torture, as I have never witnessed a movie with such brutality ""portrayed"". I was VERY pleased at the movie's deliverance in full. The torture scenes, although long, are as realistic as possible, save for the obvious CGI fire when Hesketh is burned at the stake. The flogger flogged like a pansy, too, but I wouldn't want to leave a mark on the two beautiful leading ladies if I were him, either! You will definitely at some point have to mute the sound, as the screams of agony will no doubt get to be too much to handle.

Confess your sins, and you will be spared torment.  Do not confess, and you will suffer torment.  Either way, and the end you will die. It is the story of two women falsely accused of being in league with the devil.

8544705,5,B009WS8UU8,"A superb film. Genuinely one of the finest pieces of cinema I have seen for many years. By no means a film to everyone's taste, it nonetheless makes for extremely intelligent viewing. In the past a number of film makers have skirted around depiction of the horrors of the Spanish Inquisition. This film is a game changer. This is no cynical 'women in prison'  film or titillating 'sexploitation' movie. The unremitting scenes of full-frontal female nudity and medieval torture are integral to a very serious piece of historical drama, intended to have lasting impact on the viewer rather than be a simple piece of fairly instantly forgettable entertainment.

In much the same fashion as Stephen Spielberg gave the Holocaust  an emotionally manageable proportion and impact by telling the tale of Oskar Schindler so the writing/direction team of Amy Hesketh and Jac Avila have done the same for the Inquisition by recounting the tale of  Mariana de Castro and Francisca de la Cruz and their examination for witchcraft. In juxtaposition with the torture of the two women we have 'talking head' interviews to camera of witnesses calmly delivering up evidence to the Catholic Church-appointed Inquisitor and his two clerical assistants in much the fashion Germans once denounced their neighbours to the Gestapo or subsequently the Stasi.

After two women are initially interrogated by Father Francisco Verdugo, the Inquisitor, things move at a slowly growing intensity after Father Verdugo orders that first Mariana, then Francisca, be stripped of their clothing and chained in 'the place of torment'. Disbelieving what is happening to them, or unaware of what will occur now they have forgone the opportunity to give a free confession, both women submit to being stripped naked by the torturer and his assistant with meekness and humility. Aside from initially covering their bared breasts, neither Mariana nor Francisca really struggle as they are brusquely disrobed entirely, possibly hoping the humiliation of being chained to the wall, spread-eagled and naked, is to be the limit of their suffering. They are wrong. As the intensity and absurdity of the witness statements being uttered against them increases  in the Inquisition hearing convened above their dungeon, so do the 'torments' inflicted on them by the Inquisition's robust torturer...........

Amy Hesketh, as Mariana de Castro, and Mila Joya, as Francisca de la  Cruz, give superb performances. Both give wholly convincing performances and maintain the highest level of acting throughout the film even though called upon to act out the bulk of their roles entirely naked. Even allowing for cinematic technique, most of the torture sequences must have involved considerable physical discomfort. Both actresses play out very compelling victims of torture, the performance of Amy Hesketh being truly outstanding. One or two puerile reviewers, who doubtless mistakenly bought this DVD to add to their trashy BDSM and horror collections, have described Amy Hesketh and Mila Joya as unattractive. Both Ms. Hesketh and Ms. Joya are certainly attractive, certainly both more appropriately attractive in roles set in early eighteenth century Lima, Peru, than any blond, silicon-implanted, full Brazilian-waxed, bimbo would be.

The tortures applied in this film are certainly authentic Inquisitional methods of obtaining confessions. Whipping while suspended with the hands above the head was always the opening gambit in any torturers repertoire, as was the more painful strappado variation where the victim was suspended from their wrists, with their hands behind their backs, placing unnaturally painful pressure on the shoulders. The rack was the most widely used instrument of torture once the torturer began his work in earnest, although the roasting frame was less common. The torture applied  to Mariana ( Amy Hesketh ) where her feet are lowered onto a spiked board is one of a number where the victims weight pressed parts of the body against such spikes. The use of a chair, spiked in this fashion was quite common. Possibly more common, however, than the spiked chair was the use of the so-called 'Spanish Donkey' such as Mariana was forced to sit astride, that inflicted pain on the genitals and anal region, particularly when weights were attached, as in this instance, to the victims ankles. Maleficarum illustrates Inquisitional torture very well and both Amy Hesketh and Mila Joya are very convincing in their sufferings.

Amy Hesketh is a superb cinematic talent, both as an actress and a director. She is too great a talent for Hollywood to ignore for much longer. This is very much a double-edged sword, mainstream Hollywood would expose hers talents to a far greater audience but it would almost certainly curtail her collaborations with Jac Avila that has bought us this breath-taking work, 'Maleficarum', and the equally critically acclaimed 'Justine'. Were Amy Hesketh never to make another niche 'Art House' picture then Maleficarum would serve as a fine testimony to the range of her on-screen and off-screen talents.",1500854400,,5098,5.304832713754647
