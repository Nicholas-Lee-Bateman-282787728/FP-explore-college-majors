2024781,3,B0001UZWN4,"I'm disappointed that Amazon.com listed this item as closed-captioned under format field which is incorrect.  I already sent correction to Amazon.com.  I also am disappointed with A&E not including caption or subtitle for this biography.

The biography on this DVD runs like VHS, no menus, anything like that except it will go back to the beginning every time you stop playing.  Not convenient.  Good luck on fast forwarding or rewinding to exact location you are looking for.",1143158400,5,476,5.12987012987013
2024782,3,B0001UZWN4,"I believe there have been few Americans in the last 50 years who do not recognize John Wayne, and even fewer who have never seen him.  The Duke has become a great American legend.  But despite all his fame, most people know relatively little about his life.  Wayne became so famous that the name ""John Wayne"" became associated more with a mythical figure than with a real man.  This biography attempts to go behind the manly, tough-as-nails American hero and tries to discover the real John Wayne.
For only being 100 minutes long, the documentary is surprisingly good.  It is not easy to chronicle the career of a man who made over 150 films in less than two hours.  Despite this, however, I felt that this film overlooked some important elements in Wayne's career, including many of his best-loved films like the Cowboys and El Dorado.  Also, the film gives the Duke's film total at 169, while I have seen several other (good) sources which seem to agree on the neighborhood of 153.  This is a minor detail, of course, but worth mentioning.
Despite its shortcomings, this was an enjoyable documentary, certainly worth the time it took to watch it.  Any fan of the Duke will enjoy this film, even if for no other reason than a visual chronology of (most of) the highlights of John Wayne's extremely illustrious career.",1055030400,12,1318,4.695652173913044
2024783,5,B0001UZWN4,"I have completely enjoyed anything that has been shown for John Wayne. Since I was a little boy, my mother would take me to see his movies and it never showed ignorant cussing or sex scenes that would appaul the parents. He showed manhood and decency to us kids. I wish I could spend hours of telling how this man impressed me. And how it helped me become a well educated and successful businessman. May it continue to help children learn how to be somebody.",1014595200,11,458,4.4
2024784,5,B0001UZWN4,"I saw this when it aired on A&E, and though I have always been a huge fan of John Wayne, there were a great many things that I did not know.  I found out about parts of his life and career, some I was disappointed with,  but mostly it opened my eyes.  I appreciate John Wayne more now than ever,  as a man, an actor, and a human.  I highly recommend this video.",948499200,27,361,3.8904109589041096

its great that we can see the REAL John after seeing the Actor John numerous times on film.
I also discovered that John the Actor is very much like John the Person,either way this portrays John in a positive way.",1357689600,,340,4.412698412698413

2024809,4,B0001UZWN4,"John Wayne-American Legend, is an excellent bio of the great man, encapsulating the life, and essence of the man, starred in a big picture in 1930, was then relegated to cheap 'Saturday Matinee' westerns for several years, before getting another crack at a 'big' picture in 'Stagecoach', this time he clicked, and never looked back, a fascinating road to stardom in itself, but of course, this is also about the man, the image he created, and finally, becoming that image, and of the courage shown when faced with terminal illness toward the end! You get the feeling there was little difference in the man we saw on that big screen, and the real thing!
Many have re-evaluated his talents in recent years, and realised he was indeed a good actor, and much more than just a 'cowboy star',this is a great DVD for anyone who is interested in one of the true greats of the movies! Get it pilgrim!",1286668800,4,891,4.610062893081761
2024810,4,B0001UZWN4,"This is a very enjoyable and moving presentation which stirs the patriotic soul in appreciation of the blessings and wonders of the USA! If you ever had any doubt that this is the greatest country in the world - shame on you! I challenge you to have a listen to this album. These presentations by John Wayne reflect what he truly knew and lived. He was a firm believer in the term, ""America... Love it or Leave it!""",1238889600,2,415,4.333333333333333
2024811,5,B0001UZWN4,"Its a great biography of John Wayne, I learned so much about him. Its fairly cheap and was worth the money.",1236643200,4,107,4.142857142857143
2024812,5,B0001UZWN4,"This is a great 90minute bio on  john  wayne...with many nice details of his life presented  by fellow actors and friends.  A particular highlight for me is the actual footage of his arrival at and subsequent win at the OSCARS for his movie True Grit (I never get tired of  his heartfelt speech!).
If you have John Wayne American Legend by IMAGE/20thCenturyFox which is called THE OFFICIAL STUDIO BIOGRAPHY..then you already own this. The previously released edition has a nice bonus however in featurettes narrated by Robert Culp about his 4 Movies for FOX..so its actually preferred to this newer release which  is  more expensive to boot.",1193702400,13,641,4.934579439252336
2024813,5,B0001UZWN4,"Well, I just saw this on DVD so I'm not sure why it is described as VHS tape only but the DVD definitely exists. Overall, I thought it a solid documentary of the Duke. All of his character traits are discussed and elucidated which allows us to separate the man from the gigantic legend which has been constructed around him. Most pleasing is that Wayne never took himself too seriously as evidenced by his appearance at Harvard and the making of True Grit. His range as an actor has totally been underappreciated. Ron Howard points out that no leading man in Hollywood today would have taken his role in The Searchers as it's far too complex and nuance filled for our modern times, but not for John Wayne. He had his own times. John Wayne was and is an American legend, and, although it's a clich&eacute;, I wish we had more men like him today. As an aside, without commercials many of these biographies are a slim and brisk 90 minutes which makes you wonder why we ever agreed to watch TV in the first place.",1181347200,,1009,4.43010752688172
