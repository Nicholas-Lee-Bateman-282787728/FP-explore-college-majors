4718213,3,B005KR6NNG,"I just watched this dvd last night w/my family for Christmas..While we all enjoyed different parts of the play the singing just became too much..It seemed like after every conversation between some of the characters they would always break out in song.
It just became ridiculous after a while and the play was long as hell..Most of my family members were asleep before the play even ended..I'll just stick to Tyler's movies.",1322179200,4,424,4.902777777777778
4718214,5,B005KR6NNG,"Hillariously funny! I like that Mr. Perry is able to make you laugh and give valuable, common sense life lessons.",1322092800,3,113,4.7
4718215,3,B005KR6NNG,"I am a big Tyler Perry fan, I really enjoy watching his plays and movies, but Tyler Perry is getting very redundant. This play is a great joy to watch. Me and my dad watched it and we both loved it, but it still misses some of the key characteristics he had in his first 3 or 4 plays, and has to much of stuff he doesn't need. Every play Tyler Perry brings out he starts to cuss more and more. At first he just said ""hell"", with a few marijuana references here and there. As he produces more and more, he say's ""ass"" 20 times, ""damn"" 4-5 times....borderlines blasphemy in my opinion in some cases, and every play there is a marijuana reference, EVERY PLAY! Like c'mon Tyler, it was funny at first, but do something different. Not every character has to have a marijuana hobby.

This play is more about Tyler Perry (Madea) than anybody. Of course, we ALL LOVE MADEA! She is so awesome and funny, but lately when there is a play with Madea, its ALL ABOUT MADEA! There is so much talent on the stage, yet Madea is the only one talking 90% of the time. Telling moral stories and how to live life. Let someone else give those words of wisdom. Only time there are actually serious moments in the play, is when Tyler Perry is not on stage. The play is very funny without Madea a lot of times. Or when the characters are trying portray a serious situation, Madea is just ad-libbing the entire time, pulling you out of the story seriousness. I truly want Tyler Perry to keep doing work and making plays and movies. However, variety is key. Not the same old concept of black people doing bad. Not to mention the movies, those have really been bad lately.. Madeas Big Happy Family movie is IDENTICAL to the play, no new jokes, same EVERYTHING! I really do not understand why make a movie into a play, but not change a darn thing about it....Money maybe? But you don't want me to bootleg..? But you want to make 2 shows the exact same way to just make more money???....right.

There is another play coming out called ""The haves and the have nots"", it is currently on tour, yet, the title alone is basically the same story of this ""Christmas"" play....Cmon now...

I'm getting off track here, I just really want the old Tyler Perry to start making great stories again, with an intriguing story line. Cut out all the excess fat and garbage. This is overall a good play, it is a GREAT play if you are not familiar with Tyler Perry plays. For older fans, it's just another money maker, that will turn into a movie.

BLU-RAY -
It was amazing to see this play on Blu-Ray, I wish he would go back and reformat the older plays and make them High Def. The sound and visual of the play, is VERY detailed. You can see everything on the set so smoothly, the colors are so vibrant. I was literally blown away with the video quality of this play on Blu-Ray. I'm going to have to snag ""Madeas Big Happy Family - The Play"" on Blu-Ray after seeing this fantastic quality.",1322006400,47,2941,4.3321234119782215
4718216,5,B005KR6NNG,"This is an AWESOME play!!! All of the Tyler Perry plays and movies are awesome! This was a great one to add to my collection!!! Look forward to every new movie,play, and tv series to come!!!! If anyone doesn't like it they are just a bunch of haters!!! Tyler perry is AWESOME!!!!",1321920000,,279,4.384615384615385
4718217,5,B005KR6NNG,"We, my husband and I, also went to see the play.  Even though we didn't have great seats, we didn't regret attending this play.  It was so funny but with a much needed point.  Thanks so much to Tyler Perry for being real!!  Get this DVD!!

4718218,5,B005KR6NNG,"My husband and I saw this play live and I must say that it is another one for the books! It was hilarious.  Everything is not always as it seems that is for sure. Mr Perry always knows how to bring it.  This is worth buying and if you haven't seen one of his plays live, you are missing out.  There is nothing like it.  And for the Nay sayers, keep your comments to yourself! We must uplift one another and if you do not like Mr Perry then keep it moving.",1321315200,62,455,3.9130434782608696
4718219,1,B005KR6NNG,"If you've seen one of these lame films, you've seen them all. Tyler Perry has recycled them same tired themes again. There are so many other movies produced with insight and creativity, you can only hope that the upcoming African-American directors will get the opportunities to shove to the curb this schlop.",1321228800,11,309,4.961538461538462

4718234,5,B005KR6NNG,"Let me just make this clear, this is NOTHING like the Madea movie of the same name. I actually was not a big fan of the movie, but I love this play. The story is completely different, as is the underlying message. And unlike the movie version, Madea is hilarious, even though it takes her 30 minutes to show up. Aunt BAM is wonderful as usual and newcomer Haddie steals every scene she's in. This is a great addition to your Madea play collection. My stomach still hurts from laughing!",1490486400,,485,4.4

I LOVE Madea's character and ""most"" of her movies and plays, although I do ""prefer"" the movies over the plays.  This particular movie wasn't one of Mr. Perry's best productions.  I prefer to see much more of Madea and a little less of the singing and hoopla.",1402704000,,347,4.292307692307692

4718708,1,B005KR6NNG,I was sent the wrong movie. I was way overcharged for it. I would rather go and purchase it when it comes out. They sent the play twice.. They did however when I called refund my money. Still I didn't get the item that was in the description with a picture. Bad experience all around..,1402272000,,285,4.2
4718709,1,B005KR6NNG,This is Madea. But I hated it. Too much singing and you can tell it is a Play so you can't loose yourself in the Movie. I like her movies so I can forget about my own problems but this time I found myself switching to other things and just listening to the sound. Would not advice renting this play,1402012800,,298,3.9833333333333334
4718710,2,B005KR6NNG,I'm sure if you like plays instead of movies this would be great.  I did order the play and meant to order the movie.  I still plan on getting the movie since the previews were so funny!  My mistake not the Blu-Ray!!!!!,1402012800,,219,4.166666666666667

4718712,5,B005KR6NNG,"It is hard to believe that Tyler Perry's Madea and Tyler Perry are the same person.  This is achieved by the superior ability of a talented actor. I watched Madea in films and stage shows on film. I enjoyed them so much. She would be fun to have as a neighbor. She tells it how it is in a funny way and doesn't candy coat anything.
Tyler Perry give us some more Madea, please.",1401408000,,376,4.081081081081081

4718726,4,B005KR6NNG,"Tyler has one thing that is likeable by anyone and everyone, he is continually giving advice to young kids, to adults and the general public. He injects religious believes that affect those who are watching any of Tyler's movies. It's great the way he depicts the life that is typical of African Americans. He has done a great job. He surrounds himself with singers that you don't find easily. Great singers. Tyler and all his crew, CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!",1400371200,2,453,4.896103896103896
4718727,3,B005KR6NNG,"I love Medea! I watched this thinking it MUST be as good as the other Medea movies. I was sorely disappointed. When they title it ""The Play"", it really IS a play, a video recording of a play. I kept watching it waiting for Medea to show up, which was WELL into the play (I seriously considered fast forwarding the play until Medea showed up in it). I was entertained when Medea FINALLY showed up and yes, that part was funny, but after torturing myself by watching the whole thing, I really wished I HAD fast forwarded to the Medea part and only watched that part. Is it worth it to watch? I'm still not sure!",1399420800,,609,4.258620689655173
4718728,5,B005KR6NNG,"I have always enjoyed Tyler Perry's productions. Madea is hilarious, but grounded. She draws you in to receive the intended message. Life can be tedious and sometimes overwhelming. These characters are funny, yet believable because we all know someone similar. Sometimes we misjudge others because we really don't really know them. These plays are reminders of that as well.",1399420800,,374,5.3559322033898304

4718759,3,B005KR6NNG,"The play format doesn't work for a movie.
Supporting acting by cook was lousy-way overdone.
Singing was completely unnecessary and boring.

more. We never get tired of Medea and your superb acting!!

It was a great Christmas movie that related to how families can be judgmental and have diffrences during times they should put aside feelings and get along.  I loved the cast as they were excellent in their roles. I appreciated the stand that the school that was represented took, which was for the true meaning of Christmas to be represented. The ending was perfect and how the town came together and everyone could celebrate the season of love and happiness. It showed when everyone works through diffrences attitudes can change and everyone can be happy. I saw this movie twice.",1394150400,,610,4.809523809523809

4718797,1,B005KR6NNG,"It was boring and the wrong venue for Madea. Her type of humor is funny in a real movie with a diversity of actors and actresses that
compliment the ""Madea"" role.
We could not sit through the entire thing so maybe it got better later. Hope so. Was a waste of money and spoiled ""Madea"" for us.",1393459200,,292,4.140350877192983

4718855,1,B005KR6NNG,This was just horrible. horrible. horrible. and we usually love Madea. Stilted stupid acting. Waaay too much specifying by Medea ( and before this I thought I'd never get too much of that!). Amateurish. $2.99 wasted.,1392163200,,216,5.027777777777778
4718856,5,B005KR6NNG,WONDERFUL PLAY--I HAVE LOANED IT OUT NUMEROUS TIMES FOR OTHERS WHO NEEDS A GOOD LAUGH AS WELL AS A MESSAGE FROM THE BIBLE---TYLER PERRY  AND HIS CAST WERE WONDERFUL.,1392163200,,165,4.689655172413793
4718857,3,B005KR6NNG,this was a poorly made play was the worst Tyler Perry movie yet. I would not recommend this play to anyone.,1391990400,,107,4.142857142857143
4718858,1,B005KR6NNG,"We are so tired of having politics brought into movies - Republicans degraded once again.
We have decided that this is our last Tyler Perry movie; we turned it off.",1391558400,,164,4.5
4718859,4,B005KR6NNG,"Really like Tyler Perry and his character, Madea.  Sometimes the straight shooting hits home and if it doesn't it makes you think.

This one not my favorite but still enjoyed it.",1391385600,,178,4.709677419354839
4718860,5,B005KR6NNG,"This is one of Tyler Perry's better plays in my opinion.  Constant laughter and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It is a long movie, but does not feel that long given the humor and twists and turns.  I would not necessarily call it a musical, but there is a song every 15-minutes or so on average.  It is a ""Christmas"" theme, but is broad enough in its content to be watched at any time of the year and thoroughly enjoy it.

It has the usual multiple-story-lines that portray the realities of life and real-world situations, and the truths and wisdom that model the right way to react to things in life.  A lot of moral wisdom expressed a midst the real-world messed up lives.

There is a fair amount of mild language (g-d, hell, etc.) that is inline with what you usually find in Tyler Perry movies/plays.

The Amazon streaming, however, was horrible.  I purchased the HD version of the play, but after purchasing the HD version it said it could not play HD on my laptop.  Of course Amazon still charged me the extra cost of HD even though it would not play it in HD.  The video streaming hung-up at least a dozen times (my other streaming services are fine, it was only Amazon) and the resolution would get wacky frequently.  On two occasions the video would start to fast-forward and rewind randomly and I would have to pause it and find the right place to start playing again.

Overall, the play itself was awesome.  A 10 out of 10 in my book.  If you have never seen one of his plays don't think that you are getting something substandard because it is a play.  In my opinion his plays are far more funny than his movies.  I would rather see his plays any day.

But beware, Amazon's streaming was horrible, to the point of maddening, at least for me.",1391385600,,1746,4.403125

4718862,2,B005KR6NNG,"The four of us stopped watching this play less than half way through. We kept waiting for it to improve after Tyler Perry finally came on stage. However, it actually got worse. I gave it two stars because it did have a few funny lines by the cook and other viewers might enjoy this weird attempt at humor.",1390953600,,305,4.275862068965517
4718883,5,B005KR6NNG,Anything  that Tyler Perry is credited with is well worth viewing and everything always has an important message.  So far Medea goes to jail is my favorite.,1390867200,,156,4.7407407407407405

Not as funny as ""Madea's Family Reunion-8 Bus Stop or ""Madea's Family Reunion-13 ""Grits and Skillet""  Tyler Perry's character of Madea is truly funny ""in some real life scenarios,"" I think,especially this one:  ""Mediea Goes to Jail -15 "" Call The Police!

4718909,5,B005KR6NNG,"My mom was the one that has been telling me to watch the Madea plays. This is the second one I've seen. I like that Tyler Perry is using a modern day platform to reach people who might be turned off with the Christian theme. It touches on a lot of different topics but it always gives you a positive message. Some people may be turned off by some of the topics they cover but at the same time he is addressing every day problems and circumstances that are familiar to people but spins it with a positive message. The comedy stands alone and the sincerity of his message is awesome. I'm hooked on the Madea plays now. If you haven't watched one I would recommend you watch at least one and see what you think. It delivers a positive message with comedy and grace! Thank you, Tyler Perry for giving us such a wonderful creation pertaining to Christ in the form of Madea.",1389225600,,868,4.298780487804878

This is a play about people going through life while getting together to celebrate a holiday. It turns into a celebration of the birth of Jesus through the realization that He is there, more real than the gifts.
Mr. Tyler Perry, people of color are not at Republican events because of a personal choice. They vote over 95% Democrat for the same failed policies. Why... I don't know. First African Americans in positions of power in the government were Republicans ( Wallbuilders has very good DVD and book with this info) which cannot be found in many of today's history books. Both parties are failing us. Only God knows The Way.

The story, singers, and the music are very good. There is a new level of maturity and technical achievement here.

So it goes without saying that I enjoyed this play about Christmas that comes with a positive and spiritual message on dealing with life's issues. Most of the issues in the play are about common family issues such as husbands cheating on their wives and young adult pregnancies. All issues make for good educational lessons for family teenagers.

4719015,5,B005KR6NNG,"I'm a huge fan of Tyler Perry who plays the part of Madea.  He brings such a great message in every play...me and my husband laughs so hard when we watch Madea movies, but the plays are hilarious!!! Because Tyler get's overcome with laughter, and just can't help himself...The message is always clear, if we will go to our Bible, to search for answers in times of struggle, peace will come just from reading the words written in red...our outlook becomes bearable, and I'm so sadden, by the world's anti-christ behavior.  We don't allow the Bible in schools, yet we allow them in prison's?  Perhaps if we returned to allowing prayer in schools, and bibles to be taught or used in schools, they would not go the way of prison.  Unfortunately, as the Bible predicts, this way of our world must come about, for the last days on earth to be had.  I guess I hold out hope that someday, people will wake up and realize why our world is in a death spiral.  Our ""hope"" came already, He is still with us, He never left us, He's there, all we have to do is reach for the guidebook, and call our His name. I doubt my review will be published, because someone at the top will read it, and consider it offensive.  What is offensive about it?  I'm not bullying anyone, I'm giving a review, I believe, and sometimes we have to believe it to see, rather than seeing to believe it.",1355184000,,1364,4.363636363636363

4719022,3,B005KR6NNG,"I rented this play and I thought it was funny. However, once I bought a copy for my Tyler Perry video library, I was a bit disappointed. It was not as funny as I originally thought. The only scenes worth a laugh included ""Madea."" The choice of actors could have been better. I know Tyler likes to stick with certain people, but they don't fit every character well. The character ""Eric"" was way too old to play a college student. ""Japan"" was a joke! ""China"" was pretty cool! I loved ""Hattie!"" However, it was weakly constructed and poorly scripted. I know Tyler does better work than this.

This play is a great joy to watch. Me and my dad watched it and we both loved it, but it still misses some of the key characteristics he had in his first 3 or 4 plays, and has to much of stuff he doesn't need. Every play Tyler Perry brings out he starts to cuss more and more. At first he just said ""hell"", with a few marijuana references here and there. As he produces more and more, he say's ""ass"" 20 times, ""damn"" 4-5 times....borderlines blasphemy in my opinion in some cases, and every play there is a marijuana reference, EVERY PLAY! Like c'mon Tyler, it was funny at first, but do something different. Not every character has to have a marijuana hobby"".  Tyler Perry seems to be coming more and more away from christian views.",1341187200,,880,4.295180722891566

This is by far the WORSE thing he has ever written! It's so bad he should be ashamed to even put his name on it! It's beyond recycled. It's pure TRASH! Children named China and Japan? What kind of LAME joke is that? And the Hattie character was a total buffoon! The rich couple portrayed in the play aren't even close to being believable! I used to like Tyler Perry's Madea character and couldn't bear the thought of him retiring her. But now, I'm starting to think it's time for him to let her go and MOVE ON! The sad thing about this play is the fact it actually seems as if Tyler Perry borrowed the idea for this play from the movie ""Jumping The Broom"".

If you love Tyler Perry, you might actually like this DVD. But if you like being entertained and don't like recycled plots or buffoonish characters, you'll hate this one. My suggestion is to save your money and time by passing on this one. Let's hope the next script Tyler Perry writes is better. If not, maybe it's time for him to pass the torch to someone else.",1329177600,2,1183,4.234513274336283

4719110,5,B005KR6NNG,"There is so much to be said and that will be said about this play. If I were to give a blow by blow of all the positive aspects of this play, I'd be writing for quite a while. What I will say is that it was the best Christmas present I received this year.  Yeah, sometimes it can come from strangers.

Tamar Davis singing to Tony, Cassi Davis & Chandra Currelley-Young singing Gospel, Tony Grant, Alexis Jones & Maurice Lauchner, Tamar Davis & Jeffrey Lewis singing Christmas songs was a REAL delight. Where Tyler Perry finds this talent I DO NOT KNOW, it's got to be heaven sent. But, the concept, the acting, the plot and the set was wonderfully put together. What a beautiful message it sends to all who listens. And, a heartfelt performance by all of the cast members.",1325980800,,772,4.391608391608392

4719134,2,B005KR6NNG,"Don't get me wrong, Tyler Perry has created a wonderful character (Madea) that is loved by everyone, especially when she walked onto this stage. I honestly felt like I was holding my breathe from the beginning of the production and then freely exhaled once Madea walked in. In other words, the acting was really bad until Madea walked in.

The storyline is also a bit awkward, especially with the surprise (divorce) ending.

I do have to give him props, though because during this movie, he was able to convey the true meaning of Christmas and what it means to hide the Word in your heart. Thanks TP!

But overall, I was disappointed with this production and hope there is something else Madea can do.",1325289600,,701,4.637096774193548

This movie is funny and it keeps you laughing from start to finish.

4719153,4,B005KR6NNG,"I've seen all of Tyler Perry's plays, movies and TV shows. Don't get me wrong, I love Tyler Perry and the messages he put in his work are awesome; however, Tyler needs to work on his endings. The play, overall, was good and entertaining. It's about a very well to do family who is spending Christmas in their Cape Cod home. Although the mistress of the house (Chandra Currelley) promised her maid (Cheryl ""Pepsi"" Riley) that she could have Christmas off, she changes her mind and demands that she works. The maid calls her family to let them know that she won't be home; however, unbeknownst to her, the mistress's daughter (Tamar Davis) calls and invites them to their home for Christmas. Once the family, spearheaded by Madea (Tyler Perry) and Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis), arrives at the Cape Cod home all heck breaks loose. Again, it's a good play; but, it has a rushed ending. And for all those people here that have negative comments, take them to his message board. He actually listens to his fans.",1324598400,5,999,4.617977528089888

4719158,1,B005KR6NNG,"I was very disappointed with this stage play. I thought this was the same Madea's Christmas play that aired several years ago on CTN Christian television network. Boy was I wrong. This was not the same play. I decided to rent this through Amazon Instant Video. I was so annoyed again there is nothing new or fresh about this play. I felt like I have seen this same story in his other play and I am really tired of the same story. I did not laugh at all it was so boring and predictable. There was too much singing and the content just lost my attention. I was checking my e-mail during the songs. It did not seem like there was much acting and when there was acting the content was so typical. Many recycled stories of other movies and plays that came out previously from Tyler. The fans need to speak out about this. I found myself loosing interest and barely made it to the end of the play. I really miss the plays that made Tyler popular in the beginning of his career. I find it disturbing to watch Madea and other characters making quotes from the bible and still use profanity from the same mouth of that character a few moments later in the same scene. I don't want my 13 year old daughter watching this to get the wrong message. The shock value in the play is not necessary. I was not shocked at all. All I can say is this play is not family friendly. I did not feel comfortable showing this play in the presence of my grandmother or any other relatives that expected the classic Tyler plays from a time when there was no profanity and the most you would hear is the word ""Hell"". I would say he is really pushing the limits and at some point many fans will loose interest and stop supporting his plays and films. I am having a hard time deciding if I will continue to support any future Tyler Perry productions. My 13 year old daughter was annoyed that there was too much singing and was very uncomfortable with the profanity drug references. I was hoping for a family friendly Christmas comedy that I would be proud to show at our holiday family gathering. Now I will need to find something that will not offend many of my christian relatives. So to save myself from being embarrassed during our family gathering I will not recommend this play to buy as a gift or recommend watching with a group of people with small children. Your holiday may turn into a big debate. I want a Merry Christmas not a drama filled Christmas debating why I choose to show a movie that would offend so many people in my family.",1324166400,9,2515,4.330508474576271
4719159,1,B005KR6NNG,You will like this if it is your intent to do so before watching it. You will like it if you idolize Tyler Perry and couldn't care less about what he's producing.

4719165,4,B005KR6NNG,"I order this play on here,(haven't arrived yet)and then the following day my mom went out and got it from Kmart. I was upset about that because I don't want to go through the return process; So I'm giving it away(to who? I have no clue).

But anyhow. The play was just okay for me. It had some very funny scenes and slow ones as well. For me his plays are becoming a little boring. I mean they are starting to be a lot like the other plays he's done and even like some movies others has done.

This play is okay, there is a good message in it itself, but, it kinda made me a upset because of the portrait painted for African Americans. It was okay at first, but then it just got worse and worst. In all of his plays except one(I believe) there are addict's, thieves, prostitutes, h*es(sleeping with best friend/sister's husband),rape etc. But in this play there's a rich African American family....oh and they're bougie. Now don't get me wrong, there are a lot of people that act that way. The thing is, don't think you're better than someone that has less than you.

And the way they(the maids family) were acting just made me sick. I know Madea is ghetto but dang she should know at least how to act while around others that maybe offend or even scared, lol. I was really hoping that when they came back that they would have a little bit more sense. I'm just tired of us always having to be portrayed as always being ghetto, hood, sluts, thieves or whatnot.

I understand that there are people like that out there and the message's are meant to help. But that's not how all of us are/act. There are people out there that would love a play/movie by Tyler more about them that's not all about the ghettoness. I'm not sure if For Colored Girls display a different life style because I haven't seen it yet. All I ask is for Tyler to switch it up. Gives us something different.

*UPDATE*

I've finally received my package from amazon. It was well wrap, but when I took every thing out of the box the only dvd in the box that wasn't wrapped in the dvd plastic was this play. It still had its seal across the top but the dvd was very easy to remove, the top part of the case was the only part with the seal. I've ordered plenty of dvds from here and this was the only one that was sent unsealed. Buuuuut....the disc seemed to be fine. meaning there were no visible scratches and or marks. i just hope that they remember to seal the deal next time.

Tyler Perry writes out his characters and nails it proper.  the Hood meets the Burbs and it works.  TYler Perry outta have about 3 oscars by now easily and other awards. nobody out works  Tyler Perry at all.  film, tv, music, books, plays who else is seeing his versatility? this is  good for the holidays.this  film was  so  tight that the christmas tree and  the fish  tank  glowed as if it really was  christmas  day  outside.",1323129600,10,915,4.391566265060241

The whole cast got all Jesus-y at the end, but the content and overall gestalt of the plot gave a big huge wink to extra-marital affairs as if they are a normal, acceptable part of life.  Also, there were some pretty slow spots that seemed like a good time to get up and check my e-mail, being pretty sure I wasn't missing anything.

On the upside, there were some very funny scenes, and the singing was excellent.  The ""moral"" of the story, however, left me scratching my head in wonder.",1322956800,,666,4.246031746031746

I know many don't like the singing, but the songs can and do bring deliverance to souls... The songs are beautiful and touch the spirit man..

This is very good quality and has some truth to the plot that people live out in their daily lives.. You never know who will be delivered and free from bondage.. When they view this awesome play.

We will continue to watch this with our family and friends. We own all of Tyler Perry's movies and plays.. We enjoy them, and we watch all of them over and over.. There is not much clean fun that you can watch with your children, but you can watch all of Tyler Perry's movies and plays, Our children love each and everyone of them.. And they love all of the T.V. shows.. We missed the new T.V. Show For Better Or For Worst that aired on 11/25.. We hope it will re air..

We purchase them as soon as they come out.. We are waiting on Why did I get married when he proposed with Kelly Price.. Can't wait until that one is released on DVD.. And We can not wait to see the new movie that is coming out in 2/2012 or his new TV shows that are coming out on TBS... So excited to see some good clean family fun..... Don't snooze on this one, you will be sorry..

Get your laugh on!",1322352000,4,1859,4.05449591280654
