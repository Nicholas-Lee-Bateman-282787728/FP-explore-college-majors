8186175,1,B000OPX31E,"Historical accuracy is very much at stake in this documentary. If the author would have looked into the historical truth of this man, it would reveal that he was one of many people Stowe based her character Uncle Tom upon, and he used the connection to Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin as advertising for his various autobiographies. See the  Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin chapters 4 and 6 for reference. Stowe used Henson's story as a basis for her character George Harris too, so why must Henson be the ""Real Uncle Tom""? Please question the accuracy of this documentary",1430438400,,559,4.704081632653061
8186176,5,B000OPX31E,"Learn the truth about this great man who has smeared. Once an admired figure, now his name is used as an insult.
 This man was  fine example, sure he made some mistakes but he learned and help numerous people. History owes him an Apology.
 Everyone should own this. I admit I didn't like the  singing but that's not relevant to the story.",1266278400,4,338,4.403225806451613
8186177,3,B000OPX31E,"Perhaps three stars was generous, but Larnelles singing made me give it a three star instead of a two.  It was somewhat informative.  It left many questions by what it didn`t say.  Slightly on the P.C. side and some of the graphics were cheesy. Nevertheless I didn`t consider it a waste of time only money.  Not worth twenty bucks, maybe five.",1255219200,,343,4.573770491803279
