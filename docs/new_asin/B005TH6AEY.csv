8486169,4,B005TH6AEY,"The first movie I watched when I was in high school and had to go to the art house theater out here. I loved it so much I went many more times and took friends. The movie is so campy but it does it well. The second one is even more campy but loses some of the charm the first had.
The blu ray does come with the special features that was on the DVD and with a pretty good transfer, but nothing to ride home about. It is nice to be able to get both in one collection and save rather than buy both for more.
The fact it's on one disc is not my favorite thing cause it feels like I didn't get much, but they save money on distribution and makes this as cheap as it could.
Overall good buy if you don't own them, or if you just want to include it with your blu rays",1348617600,3,761,3.7625
