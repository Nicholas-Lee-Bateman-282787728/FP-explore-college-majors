8017850,5,B0001XASEE,So glad i found this! I loved it when it was on WHT,1460764800,,51,3.0
8017851,2,B0001XASEE,"I have had great luck with Amazon's instant videos--until this past order, ""Seduction of Inga."" I realize that this is a very old movie, but the picture faded in and out during the entire video. Much of the time, I could not see a picture, although the sound was fine.",1391904000,4,268,4.38
8017852,3,B0001XASEE,"Pretty good early 70's Swedish film. Didn't end how I thought it would, but not a bad movie. Oh...and I LOVED the hot scene near the end!",1355011200,,137,4.111111111111111
8017853,4,B0001XASEE,"The second film in the Inga mini-franchise, ""The Seduction of Inga"",  is a worthy follow-up to the original film ""Inga"".  As the film's director Joe Sarno explains in an interview in the hefty 'extras' included on the disc - the sequel was filmed & slated for release a year after the screening of the phenomenally successeful original ""Inga' to capitalize on its' reputation, but the film's American distributors, somewhat inexplicably, elected to postpone the release for a couple of years (as well as to inject some additional nude scenes filmed using a body double for lead actress Marie Liljedahl!)...so the follow-up lost a little of its' potential steam at the box-office and is less well known.

Lensed in Sweden during the 'dark' winter months where it apparently got SO cold that the cameras froze up on one occasion - the actors nevertheless manage to produce a lot of 'heat' on the screen. Unlike its' B&W predecessor,  'Seduction.."" was filmed in color and the plot sort of takes up where the original left off, with dewey eyed Inga a few years older and still 'looking for love'.  This quest naturally provides numerous opportunities for scenes of love making and there is ample female nudity throughout.  Not to put too fine a point to it, but the appeal of these light weight sex romps is decidedly correlated to the beauty of the Swedish starlettes on display and there is no denying that Marie Leljedahl, in her heyday, was a stand-out with her Lolita-esque baby face and knock-out body. Add to this the catchy pop soundtrack and title song by two of the musicians who later went on to form half of the super group ABBA and lotsa groovey free-lovin' euroteeens shedding their clothes and you have the makings of a very enjoyable piece of period soft core smut.  After many years of scarcity (that tended to drive the price up beyond what this flik is really worth) - it appears that RetroSeduction Cinema has recently (2012) (re) issued this film on DVD ... resulting in better availability and pricing.  ""The Seduction of Inga"" is definitely a good candidate for 'the collection'.",1304640000,6,2099,4.827298050139276
8017854,4,B0001XASEE,Not made in the early 80's but very early 70's (in reply to the above reveiwer). A different era. Very erotic for it's time but not as good as the original INGA from 69. Maria L is very erotic actress from that time that was also very inocent at the same time. Very campy erotic film. Worth the price but try to catch the original which is better.,1283040000,5,347,4.117647058823529
