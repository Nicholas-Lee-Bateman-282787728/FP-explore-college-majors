5696876,5,B00C7VZAQO,"This is an extremely well done translation of the original anime of the same name. The characters are true in both looks and character to the anime, and easily identifiable. While some of the story line is condensed, it was understandable and intelligently done. The fight scenes are some of the best i have ever seen, with Kenshins' god-like speed done in such a way that it is convincing, at least in martial arts terms. I highly recommend this movie!",1376006400,,453,4.675
5696877,5,B00C7VZAQO,"Fast, Quality product, very good!!!!!!!!got to me very fast. Love the Movie its great. good job.....Thanks a lot. and i look forward for more titles.",1373328000,,149,5.0
5696878,4,B00C7VZAQO,"I feel that Live Action versions of popular manga suffers greatly.  A few studios have pulled it off with great effect, but still suffers a little due to budget constraints or reliance upon CGI to make up the difference.

A couple things you need to know:

1.  Region A.  I highly doubt this will ever get a formal porting to the US market, but Region A Blu-Ray will more than suffice.  Just be mindful where you're buying it for or for whatever machine you're watching it on.  Likewise, this was internationally shipped so if you're in a rush, add a weeks worth of waiting.

2.  Plot is pretty much a rendition of the introductory arc of the Original Rurouni Kenshin/Samurai X.  While a few characters are tweaked for saving time, they did as much as they could to cram memorable cast members in for fanservice or for possible sequels.  Honestly, they probably could have left Sannosuke and Saito out and still had the same movie for less time.  Also they dropped in the Tomoe arc to explain his characteristic ""X"" scar which honestly they should have left out.

3.  The actual Blu-Ray itself doesn't have a lot of features, the visual quality is probably somewhere between regular commercial DVD and Blu-Ray, but that could be my older generation LCD screen too.

Overall:  It's a very good movie, but can drag on if you're not used to Live Action adaptations due to the episodic nature of the original content.  It's easy to follow for newbies but has fidelity to the series.",1371600000,4,1478,4.623076923076923

5696880,4,B00C7VZAQO,"I saw the sequel first, so I wanted to see the original. I didn't know the story before and was intrigued by the characters.

5696885,2,B00C7VZAQO,why two stars: the movie rocks!. however the subs and the video quality could have been much better.

5696889,5,B00C7VZAQO,"I first borrowed this from my library, it is truly excellent, and I had to own it! I grew up watching the anime on Toonami. I have since purchased all the manga and dvds of the anime, I am a big Kenshin fan. This movie seamlessly combines of a number of the anime first season story lines. The acting and production values are equal to Hollywood action movie standards. It is not voiced over, but subtitled, which is a plus to me. If you love Kenshin, you will enjoy this movie.",1431734400,4,478,4.263736263736264

5696892,5,B00C7VZAQO,"Fantastically well done. The translation of the character's mannerisms from the Anime to the Live-Action suggests a high level of attention to detail. I don't speak a word of Japanese, but the subtitles were enough to make it through the entire movie. I enjoyed the entire movie with a constant grin of a 7 year old. If you've seen any of the animated series or the OVAs, you'll definitely enjoy this.",1422489600,,401,4.661971830985915

5696895,5,B00C7VZAQO,I have watched this movie at least ten times and every time it's still as good as the first. I have seen other movies based of Anime that I loved and hated them this one is different the director worked hand in hand with Nobuhiro Watsuki and all I can say is that made it great the director stayed true to the spirit of the manga and made sure that it would please not only the fans but Watsuki-san as well. the only thing that I hate is the fact that I'll never get to see it on the big screen. My hopes for the squeal are high.,1400544000,,529,3.9074074074074074
5696896,5,B00C7VZAQO,"Guess I'm a kid at heart.  I used to watch the animated ones with my kids, goofy and serious at the same time.  I always thought when will they come up with a live action film.  One day I searched and was surprised they actually made one, where have I been?  I was psyched amazon was the only place to get one for a good price.  Fight scenes were great, actors were awesome.",1392249600,,374,4.068493150684931

8578462,5,B00C7VZAQO,"I absolutely loved this movie! I don't know anything about this manga/anime series; it was only recommended to me by a friend. Since I think the actor's cute, I expected a really campy samurai movie with lame effects; nope. This was good storytelling with impressive characters! And the fight scenes were amazing! I really enjoyed the end, when the showdown happened. I definitely want to follow this adventure to the end.",1481068800,,422,4.957746478873239
