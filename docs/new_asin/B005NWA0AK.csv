8480806,3,B005NWA0AK,"I saw this Brazilian movie on You Tube. Joelma 23 Andar(1980) is a drama/disaster movie starring Beth Goulart. The story takes place in Brazil in 1974. The film was based on a book called ""We Were Six"".
A defective air conditioner sets an office building on fire. There were no sprinklers or fire escapes in the building. Many people died. This movie actually uses real stock footage from the real Joelma Fire! Parts of the film have a supernatural tone. PBS may have shown documentaries on the Joelma Building in the 1980's.
The stock music in the film is amusing. We can hear Bernard Herrmann's Psycho theme in two scenes. In one scene, a woman jumps from a window and turns into a man on her way down! LOL! HA, HA, HA, HA, HA, HA! Oh, my!
This film is in Portuguese. Disaster movies were trendy in the 1970's. By the late 1970's, people were losing interest in the genre and started flocking to the special effects driven spectacles churned out by George Lucas, Richard Donner, Peter Hyams and Steven Spielberg. The credits for this film have a Samba beat! Joelma 23 Andar has a nostalgic, campy charm.",1359331200,,1105,4.585858585858586
