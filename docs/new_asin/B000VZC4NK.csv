8220713,4,B000VZC4NK,"I first saw a video clip of Andy McKee on YouTube, was impressed and sought further information, hence the DVD.
It features Andy and Antoine, 8 tracks each, played in their own fairly unique styles.
It is as if they are playing to you in your own home, a private recital.
I feel they are both best seen, you would miss their unique playing styles if you were only listening to an audio CD.
They are both exremely talented, a real pleasure to watch.",1218067200,,448,4.345238095238095
8220714,5,B000VZC4NK,I bought this DVD specifically for Andy McKee. I have seen him live with Don Ross. The DVD is awesome. It is simple and straight forward. It is an upclose recording of Andy and Antoine with no audience. The quality is excellent. You get to see the techniques they use on the guitar.,1201046400,2,282,4.339622641509434
