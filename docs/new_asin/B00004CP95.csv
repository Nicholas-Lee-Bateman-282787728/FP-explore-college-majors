7919976,2,B00004CP95,"This was a hard to find TV movie made approximate 30 years ago.  The DVD was poor in quality and almost looked like a 'knock off.'  Still, I enjoyed the seeing the movie once more.",1382227200,,180,4.114285714285714

7919978,2,B00004CP95,"If the British think this is comedy, I would hate to see their drama.  Looks to me to be a treatise on city life in Liverpool.  Buildings are boarded up.  Everything is in ruin.  Trash and abandoned vehicles everywhere.  Young punks roaming the streets mugging people.  Even the people scurry around like rats.  What a bunch of derelicts.  The movie is depressing.  I bought the movie to watch Joanne Whalley.  I can't believe she would lend her talents to such a film.  This certainly is not their finest hour.",1345766400,,511,4.629213483146067
7919979,5,B00004CP95,"The Charleston Club on Stanley Street in Liverpool on New Years Eve.  The mob run club is hosting 400 pensioners with half being of the Protestant Orange persuasion in fancy dress the other Irish Catholic in costume.  Interspersed are some elderly with mental disabilities.  A rock band is booked as well as an inept comic and a bad magician(played by Elvis Costello).  This isn't a potential powder keg. It is one and all you need is for somebody to light the match.  It culminates with each side singing patriotic war songs trying to drown each other out and two former foot soldiers from opposing sides engaging in fisticuffs in the men's stalls.  ""No Surrender"" is primarily set in the cramped dining room of the Charleston Club and director Peter Smith effectively ratchets the maximum tension.  There are many stories, backstories, and sidestories and Alan Bleasdale's script expertly incorporates them into the narrative.  There are many terrific performances on hand no more so than Ray McAnally who plays a proud Orangeman whose daughter had the audacity to marry a Catholic.  This film came out in 1985 when the Troubles in Ireland were front and center.  Now that peace has been achieved the film may have lost some significance but none of its power.",1341878400,4,1262,4.910377358490566
7919980,5,B00004CP95,"This is one of my all-time favorite black comedies, but very obscure.  Ray McAnally (played the bishop in The Mission) and Bernard Hill (played the captain in Titanic) spar in an alice-in-wonderland nightmare night as catholic and protestant groups are booked simultaneous in a outskirts-urban nightclub in Ireland for New Years Eve.  I think it's brilliant but I should warn you, I've played it for a few people who stared in silence.  In the tradition of older, 1950s English black comedies and parlor comedies but with the black humor element turned way up for the 80s.  It also makes a statement about ethnic prejudice and the grim results which is timeless and timely in 2007, twenty years later.",1169769600,10,701,4.915254237288136
