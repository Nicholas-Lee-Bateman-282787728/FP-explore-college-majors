I recorded it from television on VHS a number of years ago.  Now it's on DVD, wonderful, but oh ye Gods at an absurdly expensive price.  I don't care if it's an import.  Print the damn thing here in the USA.  $99.00 is ridiculous!!!!

I hope Amazon can offer it cheaper soon.  I will buy it in a heartbeat.  But for $99.00, you can go scratch!!! I'll watch my videotape.",1110240000,3,517,4.730337078651686
