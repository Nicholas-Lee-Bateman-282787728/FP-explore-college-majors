6456015,5,B00L0MICXE,"This was a great family movie! We really enjoyed it, the kids loved it, and it brought back great memories of books from my childhood. The animation was a bit underdeveloped if you ask me, but the kids didn't mind, and, honestly, it didn't really take away from the movie. It could be a great way to introduce kids into the book series and encourage them to read the other books.

When we watched it, my 9 year old had just finished the first book. I had tried to read it to all of my kids a month or so ago, but it didn't hold the interest of my 6 year old twin girls, and my 11 year old (12 this week) wasn't that interested either. However, all of them loved this movie.

As any book made into a movie, there were some differences. While almost all of the events in the book were in the movie, they weren't always in the right order, and sometimes little things changed - nothing major though.",1408060800,,896,4.173410404624278
6456016,5,B00L0MICXE,"I read The Boxcar Children as a child, I read it to my older kids about a dozen years ago, and to my younger kids a couple years back.  Wonderful book, and we also enjoyed at least the first few sequels.

The idea of a movie based on the book was exciting, but I was a bit worried.  Hollywood has this tendency to take a great story and ruin it by adding a girlfriend or disrespectful attitudes or something.  Would they?

This movie does stay very close to the book, or at least to the spirit of the book.  Some things are slightly different, but not ""out of character"" different.  The children are very respectful, looking out for each other, working hard, and being grateful for the little things.  Like Benny's cracked pink cup.

6456017,5,B00L0MICXE,"We all LOVED it!  It's an adorable, sweet film.  Throughout the entire movie, Munchkin (11) kept saying, ""Wow, they are so nice!"", or ""they are so creative!"", or ""what a great idea!""  as she watched.  She started out thinking the movie would be too young for her, but she really liked it.  Buddy Boy (7) kept calling the characters the Box Elder children, lol, and he's already asked me twice today if he can watch it again.

Buddy Boy has a REALLY hard time with movies.  I've played church-made, gentle films (like this one) and he's had nightmares over them.  I was definitely hesitant about playing this before bed, but I needn't have worried.  Although there is conflict in the story, it's not ""scary"" or high intensity, and so he did great with it.  In fact, I woke up to him telling me his version of the ""Box Elder"" Children story. :)

At times I personally was moved as well.  It's definitely a children's story, but I enjoyed watching these kids' ingenuity come out, and I came away thinking that I can do a better job at being self-reliant.  Who would have thought I'd come away motivated to do better myself?  It was a pleasant surprise.

Another surprising benefit I've seen since watching the movie:  My kids are making extra effort to be nice to each other, like the siblings in the film.  Munchkin told me, ""this makes me want to be a better big sister!""  How awesome is that??  This movie gets the FULL 5 stars from me.  We all love it!",1407974400,16,1453,4.452471482889734
6456018,5,B00L0MICXE,"I remember enjoying The Boxcar Children book as a child, so I was very excited to see this, and the fact that it came from well-known and respected publishers of family-friendly entertainment made it even more exciting. My boys loved it so much that they chose it, repeatedly, probably 3 times in the same week.

But, it's more than just another kid show. This film is so well done that it is truly a delight for the whole family. My husband and I enjoyed it nearly as much as the children, and that is great when we can find something that the whole family appreciates.

It was great to see the characters of Gertrude Chandler Warner really come to life, and to see that new life breathed into a timeless classic of a story was nothing short of inspiring.

This is just such a sweet, sweet story and I was very pleased to see that the film demonstrated that well. The children demonstrate such kindness and thoughtfulness toward one another! We loved to see that, along with the creativity, hard work, and diligence. As a homeschooling mom, I am always looking for lessons in things, and this movie is a great one to build a character study around as there is just so much to learn from this movie and these characters.

My boys are 5 and 7 and the loved it. If you enjoyed the boxcar children as a child, or if you're just looking for some great family-friendly entertainment, I strongly recommend this video. It will not disappoint.

Note: I received a review copy of this DVD. I was not required to share a positive review, and I did not receive any other compensation. All thoughts and opinions are my own.",1407715200,30,1611,4.484641638225256

The voices of the children are unknown. Oscar winner J.K. Simmons provides the voice of Dr Moore and Martin Sheen provides the voice of Henry Alden.

6456055,5,B00L0MICXE,"I'm an adult and I love cartoons and animated films. I watched this movie about a dozen times on Netflix then decided to buy it on DVD.

The story is very darling and is something that young children and adults can enjoy. I love the colors and the art style, the movie looks very serene. The characters' voices are soothing and fit the art style and music well. The soundtrack uses piano and acoustic string instruments. The music has a bluegrass sound. There is nothing scary or startling in the movie. The faster parts of the movie still have the same soundtrack of piano and acoustic string instruments, they just play a little louder or with more instruments for the exciting parts.

For several months, I have had trouble falling asleep. I watch this movie and it is so relaxing and pretty that it helps me fall asleep. My boyfriend was poking fun at me for watching this cartoon all the time, so I asked him to watch it with me. And he started falling asleep and commenting on how relaxing and tranquil the movie was. He made a point to stay awake and watch the story all the way through once. Now he asks me to play it when he can't fall asleep.

I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves beautiful animations with memorable stories. It is enjoyable for all ages.",1442880000,3,1282,4.47008547008547

I wasn't sure if it would stay true to the story, but I was absolutely awed by how wonderfully they took the story and the characters and made them come alive.

6456072,4,B00L0MICXE,"I was first introduced to The Boxcar Children when I was in the 4th grade and our teacher read the story aloud to us.  Since that time, the children and the series have become a part of our family: for instance my mother has collected all of The Boxcar Children books and not just the original 19 that Gertrude Chandler Warner wrote. THE BOXCAR CHILDREN is an animated adaptation of the book of the same name.

Henry, Jessie, Violet, and Benny Alden are orphans who stick together. The only family member they know of besides each other is their mysterious grandfather who has never had a presence in their lives. Vowing to not live with the man who seemed to want nothing to do with them while their parents were alive, the children find themselves traveling at night and looking for a place to stay and a home to call their own. They eventually stumble upon a mysterious boxcar in the middle of a forest. It provides them the shelter and home they need. As money grows low, Henry finds work in a nearby town. Unbeknownst to the children, someone is looking for them and it will change their lives forever.

I wasn't for sure what to expect with THE BOXCAR CHILDREN movie. The first thing I noticed was the animation. Although not horrible, the overall animation of the movie is not the greatest. Buildings, scenery, and even water are well done, while people and animals, not so much. The film reminded me more of an early CGI animated films from the mid-to-late 1990s or some early 2000 video games. For many people, this might not be an issue, but I was really hoping for better quality animation from the first film based upon the beloved novel.

With that said, the overall stories and characters remain fairly true to the book. There are some minor differences, but the overall spirit of everything is just like the book. There isn't much action in the story, which some might find disappointing. However, THE BOXCAR CHILDREN is a movie about family, sticking together, and forgiveness. Those are values and messages that are never out-dated and they shouldn't always have to take backseat to action, adventure, and excitement. There is no violence, innuendo, or foul language.

Overall, THE BOXCAR CHILDREN is a decent adaptation of Getrude Chandler Warner's original book. The movie espouses the same values of the book and keeps to a fairly close adaptation. The film's biggest drawback is the animation which seems fairly low-budget and is more reminiscent of an early 2000's video game than a 2014 animated movie. It's a movie that any fan of The Boxcar Children will want to see and is a good movie that families of all ages can watch together.",1432857600,,2657,4.705376344086021

6456088,3,B00L0MICXE,"Note: I did not buy the DVD but watched the movie on Netflix. I had seen a trailer and was expecting to shut it off, but I wound up watching it all the way through.

The Boxcar Children have been a hit with readers for decades, from the original book by Gertrude Chandler Warner and her sequels to the eventual ""reboot"" in the 1990s they received to indefinitely continue the series with new writers. So, why did the Boxcar Children take so long to come to film?

This film is based on the original book in the series, following the four Alden childrenHenry, Jessie, Violet and Bennyas they head out to take care of themselves after their parents died. They're also determined to keep away from their grandfather. They find an old abandoned boxcar in the woods and set up a home in it, Henry taking a paternal role and going to town everyday to work to buy food for his siblings, and Jessie taking a maternal role and caring for the younger children. They adopt a stray dog they name Watch.

One thing anyone might notice is that the children seem to be too good. Benny is the only one who really gets upset, but it's mainly because he's hungry or uncomfortable, which is used to evoke what a small child he is rather than any character flaws he might have. The children are rather flat, uninteresting characters themselves, but their story of having to take care of themselves is the real attraction here. This is true of the book as well. It's not a flaw, but a frank observation. But perhaps in our cynical society, children can use role models who are just good and can also be interesting.

What turned me off about the movie initially was its animation style. It's not horrible, but it's not very good either. It's decent and won't bore you. Children who care more about bright visuals rather than detail will be fine with it. One will quickly spot its flaws, though. The most notable scene is when Watch emerges from tall grass, he almost seems to walk through it without it bending out of his way. But at least they're blades of grass and not a block of grass. Once you resign yourself to the fact that this is how the animation is, you should be fine.

The voice acting was actually one of the better parts of the movie. It fits the motion onscreen well and is not grating at all. It features notable actors such as J.K. Simmons, Martin Sheen and Joey King, and the rest of the cast fits in well. Another reviewer noted that perhaps the dialogue is too modern, but I found that easy to let slide on this one. The music was also nice.

I'd recommend this for families with small children, or for someone who can enjoy such films or fans of the books who might have wanted to see the characters come to life onscreen.",1426464000,2,2724,4.416334661354582

I know it is just a fictional story, and the story turns out so perfect and wonderful, unlike real-life for the most part, but what if all children everywhere were watching and filling their minds on good things instead of such bad and corrupt things? I believe it would make a difference in our society.",1426118400,2,469,4.662650602409639

6456121,5,B00L0MICXE,"This stays very close to the original book, more than most adaptations of ""classics.""  There were just a few things modified and none that materially changed the story.  My kids (7-12) all enjoyed it.  The animation style was a little odd, but it is at least nicer looking than animation meant for really young kids.  This sets the stage for more of the series to be done on video - though I would only buy those based on the first 20 books, the ones by the original author.",1415923200,3,474,4.3522727272727275

Don't pay attention to the only 3 star review from someone who's nitpicking over ""modern slanginess"" or not using ""period-accurate"" language.

This is such a great movie, it reminds you that families can survive anything and for children these days it is something I recommend they see. We live in a world that requires you to have the best of everything and in actuality we do not need the best, we need a lot less. Very inspiring.

6456145,5,B00L0MICXE,"I used to read these books when I was young and now my daughters (5 and 3) love the series as well thanks to this movie. The movie is excellent! After watching, my kids immediately went out into their playhouse in the backyard and began transforming it into ""the boxcar"". My 5 year old can't wait to get home from school and go outside for another ""adventure"" just like the boxcar kids. She insists that my wife and I take on the roles as Henry and Jess, while she is Violet and her sister is Benny :) This movie has actually encouraged our kids to get outside and use their imaginations. I'm so happy someone is making quality family movies that instill good manners, family values, and a sense of adventure for our young ones. I just started reading the 2nd Boxcar book (Surprise Island) to my 5 year old which I really hope they make into a movie as well. It was my favorite Boxcar book growing up and has all the makings for a wonderful feature film. I do hope that they continue to bring out these movies.",1410739200,3,1010,4.321052631578947
6456146,5,B00L0MICXE,"My eleven year old child told me he LOVED this movie. He said the animation was good and the story followed the books really closely. He said if he had not already read some of the books this movie would make him want to read them. (he also said he wants to read all of them now even the ones he read a while back, he'd read them again.) I intended to watch it all together as a family but he got a hold of it and watched it first so I am doing this review on his opinion.  After I watch it, I will try to get back on and update my review.",1410220800,5,539,3.7280701754385963
6456147,4,B00L0MICXE,"The story of ""The Boxcar Children"" is one that has captured many generations since 1942, and I was so excited to see that the book has been made into a movie! The story is a heart-warming one, and the movie makers have done a solid job at adapting the story into this animated tale. The visuals are bright and colourful, and while it wouldn't be fair to compare this DVD to a high-budget Disney film, I enjoyed watching the story play across the screen. The voices of the characters have also been well-matched and were in line with what I imagined they would sound like. The film moves along at a good pace, and I found that my children's attention was engaged from start to finish. Most importantly, with all of the questionable media material out there, parents can rest easy knowing that their children will be wonderfully entertained watching this movie, and learn some important lessons along the way. I particularly love that in this story the children serve as excellent examples to viewers, and there is plenty of suspense without the gratuitous violence so common in many movies. The ending will leave you with a nostalgic feeling, and the best part is that if your children haven't yet read this series of books, they are sure to be hooked! The first Boxcar Children book may jumpstart them into the whole series - who knew movies could play such a great role in getting your children interested in reading?

I strongly recommend ""The BoxCar Children"" for you to watch along with your children - it's perfect for a family movie night! 4 out of 5 stars.

6456148,3,B00L0MICXE,"I was very pleased that the movie stuck more or less to the book, with some slight changes which are I suppose understandable.  (But Stockings' tail!  Where's Stockings' tail?)

The problem that I had with it was that, although it was clearly set in the 1930's or 1940's (judging by the cars and so on), which is when the revised version of the book was published, the characters, especially the children, sounded far too modern.  ""Hen-ree, Hen-ree, Hen-ree,"" chant the other three while Henry is running the race.  ""Veggies,"" and constant ""wow,"" and ""yeah,"" and ""gonna,"" and ""Hi, guys.""  The language in the books is far less slangy, and if it were slangy it would be the slang of the appropriate era.  Even the tones of their voice sound wrong - just listen to the way people in the movies and radio shows of the 1940's spoke, and contrast it to the fluting tones of these children.  Yes, I know, I'm being picky, but I was unable to enjoy the show because of it; and I won't be showing it to my students, either.  I'll just continue reading it to them every year.",1409270400,10,1066,4.481865284974093

6456150,5,B00L0MICXE,"I don't think I have ever come across a film that was an adaptation of a children's classic that was not embellished with sarcasm, innuendo, or adolescent humor.  This is like a breath of fresh air, a real standout in my family's collection of animated films.  It doesn't veer from the story at all, and the tone and style are simple and sweet. My kids wanted to watch it the morning after we first saw it, which has not ever happened before.  I think the simple, quiet story is appealing and a nice change of pace from most children's animated films.  We are huge Miyazaki films, and the tempo of this film reminded me of his.  I love this.",1408665600,2,641,4.352941176470588

6456153,4,B00L0MICXE,"Are you familiar with the classic children's book, The Boxcar Children? This film is the animation of that story and a fun one to watch! The animation was done pretty well (there were a couple moments where it didn't seem/look real, but it was still good) and the picture color was great. It's a cute movie and I think most kids or fans of animation movies will enjoy this film. It's a clean movie that the whole family can watch.
