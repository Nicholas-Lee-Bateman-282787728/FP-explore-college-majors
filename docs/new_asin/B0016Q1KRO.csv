8264055,2,B0016Q1KRO,Same as the first. Great idea and poor execution. Character build up is decent. The twist at the end is rather obvious. I had high hopes for Red Room 1 & 2 but ultimately they really aren't that great. The director has some really great ideas but his execution is just dog crap. I hope he figures it out because he does have some great ideas.,1411862400,,342,4.196969696969697
8264056,5,B0016Q1KRO,I love the part when the girl eats the vomit a true classic.. red room 2 is everything saw pt 66666 wants to be,1394150400,,111,3.6666666666666665
8264057,4,B0016Q1KRO,Red Room 2 I actually liked more than Red Room 1. Only the Japanese could come up with a concept like an anything goes King's Game. Plus the actress who played the android is cute and sexy.,1353628800,,189,4.135135135135135
8264058,5,B0016Q1KRO,"This is like the first RED ROOM. Same plot. RED ROOM 2 however, is more strange. Because you'll find out about one of the people at the end. I'm not giving it away. This turned out to be a good movie. But what's with these brutal movies? I guess they like to make our stomach sick. But this movie didn't make my stomach sick. It's still a good movie.",1212883200,6,350,4.086956521739131
