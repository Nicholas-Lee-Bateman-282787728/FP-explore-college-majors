8749650,4,B01B8I0CCI,Story of British women in various WWII services.  Entertaining and a bit corny.  Nothing in depth or heavy.  An inexpensive addition to anyones war DVD collection.,1510099200,,163,5.1923076923076925
8749651,5,B01B8I0CCI,Excellent WWII story of women in Britain participating in the effort.  Right on par with Millions Like Us.  Leslie Howard left a beautiful gift when he created this meaningful and sweet movie. Predicts emancipation for women after their participation in the war effort. Very good.,1487721600,,280,5.2
