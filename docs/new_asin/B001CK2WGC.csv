8288000,2,B001CK2WGC,"I tend to watch movies hoping for "" entertainment"" value.  I would give this a "" D"" grade on that criteria.  The reason I watch South Korean movies is because I am fascinated with their modernized / almost Western culture.  They are so advanced over their North Korean counterparts.  This flows like a soap opera.  All that being said ,  it is spiced up with beautiful women  having faux intercourse.  It that is what you are looking for ... then ignore my low end grade and have fun.  I read both of the other reviews and would agree with their opinions..  This is just not my cup of tea.  I did,  however,  watch it from beginning to end  so I hope this review will be of assistance to you.",1409961600,2,692,4.263565891472868
