201912,5,188426302X,Wow the second dvd on tension free drumming is a great follow up on the first I use both of them has a reference guide contantly. Great job,1346025600,,139,4.0
201913,5,188426302X,"I bought TigerBill's Concepts of Tension Free Drumming Hand Technique: Volume 1 & Volume 2 as a package deal. I've mainly been working from Vol 1 but I can say that Vol 2 gives just as much info as Vol 1.
I have recently discovered I have Tennis Elbow from using my computer to much without a break & it is very painful.
I have been implementing Tigerbills concepts & they seem to be working pain free for me, which is great because it makes me want to play & practice again. There's nothing worse than trying to play with pain, it makes you want to stop altogether.
Thanks to these DVD's I can play again without the pain.",1346025600,,623,4.243697478991597
201914,5,188426302X,"I am studying the Tiger Bill techniques and I cannot believe how generous he is with his knowledge. He even gives you stretches to do. With my tendonitis the stretches have been helpful.  Volume two puts it all together. He takes the best of methods like Moeller and Gladstone and presents it in an easy to understand way. I am gaining speed, power and endurance everyday, PAIN FREE! Thanks again Tiger Bill!",1346025600,,408,4.666666666666667
201915,5,188426302X,"Yeah, this is exactly what I have come to expect from Tiger Bill.  And what is that?  Why a first rate product of course.  I don't knwo about you, but I play tradiational grip mostly.  Some match grip with latin and such, but mostly traditional.  There is very little out there to help you with tracitional grip.  This DVD does.  It helps with matched also.  Technique is paramount in drumming.  You can watch and learn licks, and grooves, but it is hard to watch and pick up technique, and without technique, you will be forever limited in what you can do, and VERY frustrated because you will not be able to achieve what you know you can, because you lack technique.  I just started playing again around 2 years ago, after around a 30+ year lay off.  Now I am back gigging again.  In fact, I told the guys in the band at our first gig that the last time I played for an audience was 5 to 7 years before any of them were born!  Yeah, gig went well, and my playing was solid because I had proper technique and was able to exicute clean and clear chops.
thanks Tiger Bill!

201916,5,188426302X,"Believe me. If you've purchased Volume 1 of the series, it will be impossible for you to not want to get this DVD (Volume 2) as well. Why, you ask? Well, this is because Volume 1 doesn't go into details with finger technique, and Volume 2 does. Not only that, Tigerbill goes into depth with the Moeller technique and Gladstone technique (and other more advanced techniques) as well. He also includes a fantastic section on how to warm up which seems pretty invaluable. I've never seen this aspect being covered on any other DVD, and especially when you're trying to play Tension Free, you're going to want to stretch and warm up your limbs the best possible way. My hand technique has changed and progressed immensely from working through both Volume 1 and 2 of the series. I can't recommend them both enough.. please, do yourself (and your hands) a favor and pick up this DVD (and Volume 1), NOW!",1345939200,,897,4.6125
7800859,5,188426302X,"I purchased Vol 2 after I went through Vol 1.  GET THEM BOTH.

What shocked me was how much additional material is presented here.  I didn't realize there was so much to all this, and TigerBill presents all this very expertly.  You won't find a lot of this elsewhere.

I cannot recommend both Vols 1 and 2 enough.

With these two DVDs you will have a very comprehensive basic start to learning safe tension-free drumming (as based on the principles of the old masters, Gladstone, Stone, Moeller and others as well.  Tiger Bill presents all this with very practical and thorough understanding and knowledge of body physics and martial arts.

Oh, did I mention that not only did TigerBill Melagari study extensively with the great Joe Morello (RIP) he has been known to play out here and there with Vince Martell of Vanilla Fudge?",1349654400,,828,4.701388888888889
7800860,5,188426302X,best video out there for getting your hands in shape.everything is explained and shown in great detail.leaves you with no question about how something should be done.this video and the first one by tigerbill are all you will ever need to get your  hands and arms moving properly to perform  on a drumset.,1348012800,,304,4.716981132075472
7800861,5,188426302X,"This continuation of Bill Meligari's first DVD goes into much greater detail regarding finger technique, as well as going into techniques for developing the arms. Whereas volume 1 covered the core principles that are the foundation for good hand technique, this DVD adds a great deal more information on developing advanced technique, and all within a framework of avoiding any tension in one's playing. Meligari expands on his recommendations from volume 1 of practice routines that one can use to master this material, which is very helpful. There is a vast amount of solid technical information in this DVD (as well as in volume 1) and I highly recommend it.",1347235200,,661,5.0181818181818185
7800862,5,188426302X,"This dvd offers the most detailed look into the ergonomics of drumming I have come across. Not only does he thoroughly explain the techniques, but also gives a lot of detailed info about common mistakes so that you can trouble shoot and hopefully self correct. I've been looking for something comparable for a long time and come up short until I found this. It's a great overview of many coveted techniques and (I found it more detailed and thoroughly explained than Jim Chapin and Joe Morello's videos), and provides many useful techniques for easing and avoiding tension.",1346284800,,573,4.917525773195877
7800863,5,188426302X,"I have both Tiger Bill's Volume 1 and 2 Tension Free Drumming DVDs. There are many times when I will purchase a dvd and it is nice to watch, but not always real informative as to how one achieves the technique. This is where Tiger Bill's dvds really are unique. He has a really great approach to breaking down the different steps and techniques and making it really easy to comprehend. Not all players are great teachers. However, Tiger Bill seems to have the touch for both playing and teaching. He helps you to understand when to use wrist, fingers and arms and how they can be combined all without causing any tension. He is also able to clearly compare his techniques with some of the leading methods and show you how to get more out of those familiar methods by using his tension free technique. If you are on a budget, which clearly during these economic times would not be unheard of, make sure that you have budgeted for purchasing these two volumes. I suggest getting a solid understanding of the first volume before moving on to the second. I think both dvds will give you a new perspective on the mechanics behind the art of drumming.",1346112000,,1145,4.509615384615385
7800864,5,188426302X,"Bill continues with part 2 giving many more ideas and practical examples to refine the craft that many drummers will otherwise never get.  I have attended in-person training at MI and this is unique but consistent the type of training you would get at a really great school.  Bill continues with some craziness but you can't be a good drummer with being goofy...me included.  As with anything to learn properly reinforces concepts.  All the concepts included are essential.  Get this.  Speed, control, power=tension-free.  Bill ends with a cool solo (rough video) but hey love the guitarist saying hey finish.  It is so nice that a drummer has the chops AND pisses off the guitarist.  Hey buy it and enjoy!!",1346112000,,707,4.873949579831932
7800865,5,188426302X,"This DVD is a must have for not only those who wish to play without tension, but also to improve timing, speed and technique.",1346112000,,125,4.25
7800866,5,188426302X,"As in volume 1 there is something for everyone.  There is a wealth of knowledge and experience within these dvd sets and I am not disappointed.  I can't wait for his future releases.  The only gripe may be the electronic-space like drum interludes/beats.  They are a bit... just not my taste, I guess.  They are kind of ""Out of this world.""  That's me being critical, and it's more about the content that truly matters, which the content is great.  Keep your eyes open for his future release of ""Tension Free Foot Technique"" that's expected to drop late this year.  If it's as good as these dvd's we won't be disappointed.",1346025600,,622,4.590909090909091
7800867,4,188426302X,I have found my own understanding of Hand technique improve immensely. I feel a sense of Greater control of my concepts. I cannot wait to learn about Tiger's tension free foot techniques.,1346025600,,187,4.875
7800868,5,188426302X,"Tiger Bill's DVD on hand technique is the next best thing to studying with Joe Morello. As a student of Joe's for many years, both Tiger and I know the importance of proper hand technique as a way of expressing yourself musically while having complete command of your instrument. I use this method in my own private teaching practice with great success. I guarantee if you work with this material and put in the time, it will work for you. With the passing of Joe Morello, Tiger is one of the few greats who can document the teaching of the greats while putting his own personal spin on it. Very highly recommended.",1346025600,,615,4.5
