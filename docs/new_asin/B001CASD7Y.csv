8286321,2,B001CASD7Y,"The video seems to be an OLD PRINT and hangs up when trying to watch it. The color is awful. I was very disappointed in the product and would like a better print. I am sure what Evo presented was very good and would be helpful, but after looking at it once I was so disappointed I have not gone back to use it.",1372723200,2,310,3.859375
8286322,5,B001CASD7Y,"The instructional quality of this dvd is great...the only problem is you have to practice, practice, practice.
The information is terrific along with the demonstration.
Well done!",1359763200,4,179,5.666666666666667
8286323,5,B001CASD7Y,I made my purchase on Amazon.com. Another great transaction! This is a must for autoharp players. Every page is excellent!,1358899200,2,122,5.15
8286324,5,B001CASD7Y,I decided I wanted to learn the autoharp. I really liked this tape better than some because it gave you the basic strums you could practice and easily put together. You must practice. The instrument is simple but takes practice to learn but after a few afternoons you will have fun strumming and picking your way thru familiar songs.,1224806400,8,333,4.661016949152542
