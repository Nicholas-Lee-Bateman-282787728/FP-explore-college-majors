7170450,4,B00XJJGRRO,"Not as cautious or preachy as the ""Super-Friends,"" but also not nearly as edgey or grim as Warner/DC's new wave of ""PG-13"" fare either, finding its place ALMOST nestled comfortably inside a veritable ""Goldilocks Zone."" Thus parents should have little problem showing this one to the kidlets, but it's also clever and engaging enough to hold the attention of more mature audiences as well -- a little of something for everyone.

Were it not for the character designs (read: ""ages""), the story feels very much as though it might be taking place about a decade or so prior to the world & events of ""Batman Beyond.""

Lovers of the Batman animated series may be please by the voicing of the character, but then might go on to express some disappointment after learning that the voices of The Batman, The Joker, et al, are not being supplied by fan-faves Kevin Conroy, Mark Hamill, etc., but are rather other voice actors doing their ""imitations"" of the beloved voice actors.

The major question of course is: ""Is this worth the $20 asking price? My honest answer would be, No... unless you had the intention of selling or gifting either the DVD or Blu-ray disc from the ""combo pack,"" or passing both discs along and retaining the Digital HD, or however you wanted to divvy-up the extra media; otherwise, I'd say go with the DVD version (currently at $15) and wait for the Amazon price to drop down to somewhere around $12 or less after its official home media release before deciding to acquire it through purchase.",1439337600,13,1510,4.733840304182509

This is it's own movie perhaps a tad more kid friendly but can be watched well by adults and Dc/Batman enthusiast! This could easily be a weekly series on cartoon network or Nick or even Disney xd.  It has a good feel and could have more movies on it's own outside of the more serious and harder/edgier DC movies.

7170474,3,B00XJJGRRO,"The story is paper thin,  and it will only be enjoyable if you're 6 years old.

The only reason I even gave it 3 stars was because the voice cast was spot on. Roger Craig Smith and Troy Baker are great successors to Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill.

Cyborg,  Nightwing, and Arrow all sounded exactly how they are suppose to sound as well.

It's a real shame that these great voice talents got wasted in a poor story,  poor dialog,  and an edgy art direction geared towards little kids.",1454976000,,482,4.348314606741573

7170481,4,B00XJJGRRO,"Ol' Longears returns in a second installment of the Batman Unlimited franchise based on the action figure line in this made-for-video animated movie. Monster Mayhem takes place sometime after Animal Instincts with some of the characters and events crossing over to this film, and put together by the same production crew as the previous one.

 On Halloween night, Silver Banshee(one of Superman's baddies)and Solomon Grundy escape from Arkham Asylum(although I don't know why a zombie was in Arkjam)and team up with Scarecrow, while Clayface kidnaps a young computer genius, Gogo Shoto, who in this story is some sort of rewrite of the younger version of Toyman. All of the monstrous villains are working with the Joker to launch a killer ""Joker Virus""(similar to the Batman: Digital Justice comic)which includes reprogramming Teen Titan Cyborg to be their own war machine. Batman gets Nightwing and Red Robin to help, along with Green Arrow who seems to be on a long leave from Star City in this universe. Joker unleashes his virus on Gotham City, declaring himself ""King Joker, and the rest of his crew the new city board. After rescuing Cyborg and Gogo from Joker, the Batman Family takes the fight to Team Joker as the Clown Prince of Crime plans on infecting the entire world with his virus. Batman goes into the digital realm thanks to a virtual reality visor, where he uses a conjured up robot T-Rex to stop the multiplying Joker clones. The offline Joker then uses a giant robot and repainted mecha suit for one last chance, but Cyborg and Batman manage to stop him in time.

This was a pretty good feature, even though this movie is geared more toward selling Batman toys, even to the point that in one of the online Batman Unlimited animated shorts that the Dark Knight now has a working robot T-Rex. The DVD does feature some DC Nation shorts, with the Blu-Ray having more, but so far none of the Batman Unlimited animated shorts, although the same can be said for the Justice League: Gods And Monsters shorts, so maybe they're saving them for a future collected video release. Monster Mayhem has a pretty good cast, including Troy Baker recurring his role as Joker from Arkham Origins, plus some of the animation is a little above average from Animal Instincts. If you're a major Bat-Maniac then you'll want to put this one in your Bat-DVD Player!",1447632000,,2359,4.8197530864197535

7170487,2,B00XJJGRRO,"Based on the ""New 52"" facelift of DC characters, the storyline is thin, the character interaction is almost missing, and the action ranges between mediocre and stupid.  In one scene Nightwing grabs the Bat-Jet in flight and doesn't get his arms ripped off.  I know comics are supposed to be fantasy, but the flips between fistfights with a villain who is essentially a knockoff Hulk and falling from an altitude too high to see individual streets (without a parachute) and survive change this from fantasy to pure hooey..",1445904000,2,521,4.909090909090909

Although not as edgy as the PG-13 releases, this is NOT a kids only adventure as the exchange between Nightwing and Scarecrow is depth filled for true Bat fans. Also the amazing fight sequences with an incredible array of Bat gadgets and vehicles make this a Batman the Animated Series and Batman Beyond fan celebrate!
Joker and Scarecrow are dark and twisted while Grundy provides the humor to even out the team of villains of Joker, Scarecrow, Silver Banshee, Clayface and Solomon Grundy. The addition of Cyborg to this adventure was awesome and added even more depth to the cast, which is voiced PERFECTLY! Hopefully this is only the second to many more of these Unlimited Adventures.",1440892800,3,795,4.852941176470588

Monster Mayhem is a great mix of action and fun but without the obligatory profanity or graphic violence found in all the New 52 DC Movies. There is a huge overlooked demographic of fans who enjoy seeing new or different heroes in action who are neither silly or inappropriate. The voice casting was great as well.

7170515,4,B00XJJGRRO,"Just finished watching, along with Jeff H., Batman Unlimited - Monster Mayhem released by Warner Brothers.
""Batman Unlimited - Monster Mayhem"" can be best summed up by Jeff H.'s wry observation at the end of the movie - ""This was the most cartoonish of all the animated DC movies we've watched to date,"" he said.  And Jeff H. is right.
Gotham City is a bright and shiny place in Batman Unlimited - Monster Mayhem - it's not a dark and gloomy city reeking of crime.
Spoilers Ahead!
Even Arkham Asylum, from which Solomon Grundy and Silver Banshee escape from has a wholesome appeal to it that makes it look like a weekend getaway bed and breakfast.  The gruesome twosome manage to escape on Halloween night and end up going on a joyride after stealing a car, which gets the attention of Batman, Nightwing, and Red Robin.
After giving the Terrific Trio the brush off, the two meet up with a very annoyed  Scarecrow, who at first appears to be the criminal mastermind in charge; but he's not.  That honor goes to the Joker, who has also managed to get Clayface sprung, because he wants to kidnap the world's hottest virtual reality game designer whose company is based in Gotham.
The motive behind the kidnapping is simple - the Joker wants to have a computer virus that will give him control of the entire world.
Cyborg and Green Arrow also team up with Batman, Nightwing, and Red Robin.
I couldn't help wondering if I was watching a Batman version of the old Super Friends.
Not a bad animated Batman movie, but not a particularly great one either.
Recommended!

7170517,2,B00XJJGRRO,"Let me get directly to the point - this was the worst Batman movie they've done.. Bad plot, and a story that was made for a 6 year old. If I'd have known this was going to be this juvenile, I would have never bought it. You can't take Batman, and make him less credible then this. The animation was OK, but again, the story level was just too immature. I've liked the other Batman movies, and they live up or exceed expectations. If I wanted Sesame Street, I'd have bought that (ok, it's not even that educational). It does nothing to move the Batman story forward, nor present anything that we haven't seen done better before. It lacks an element of danger, as found in the other DC animated movies, of which I have all. The comics are even more adventurous. I'm not sure who green lit this story, but the shorts found in the ""Special Features"" are more engaging. I just couldn't get into it, as it was just too dummied down.",1440115200,2,926,4.327586206896552

7170519,4,B00XJJGRRO,"TLDR: Worth a rent, better than the first one, still not up to DCAU standards, not as silly/over the top as the first one, has a few moments of real character depth.

Now for the details for those who don't mind the read:

While this is definitely more of a children's film than much of what DC is doing these days, it's a bit closer to the DCAU style of storytelling in that there are at least some aspects that have the potential to keep a more mature audience interested.

With regards to the plot, it's still pretty basic not unlike the first Batman Unlimited film, though this one definitely feels more mature and with better quality writing and action (at least for the most part, though there are a few facepalm moments).

As for the show, while it does feature the likes of Nightwing, Red Robin, Green Arrow and Cyborg, it still feels like a very small world consisting primarily of a futuristic Gotham that looks like a less dark version of the Gotham seen in the DCAU series Batman Beyond.  The villains in this one aren't given too much to do aside from the occasional fight scene for the bruisers (Clayface and Solomon Grundy) and the main focus plot-wise from a villain perspective is all Joker.  Silver Banshee has a few bits of clever dialog and the Scarecrow has a lengthy psychological confrontation/conversation with Nightwing (played by Will Friedle; an excellent choice for the character given the stark similarities between Nightwing and Terry McGinnis) that's pretty cool (particularly since we get a peek into Nightwing's character and past)

All in all, if you're a big fan of DC and are either a child looking for a very action oriented movie or an older fan willing to deal with somewhat over the top clich dialog and a much lighter take on the Batman/DC universe then you'll probably enjoy this.  I grew up with the DCAU and to this day season 1 of Justice League Unlimited is still my favorite piece of DC animation ever produced and while the sometimes silly, very basic story given to us here in Monster Mayhem is a far cry from the dark, paranoid JLU, it still has just enough meat to the story and characters to make it entertaining.

If you saw the first Batman Unlimited feature and were disappointed by the fact that it's little more than a cheesy feature length toy commercial it might be worth giving this one a shot because while the cheese is still there, it's a much smaller helping this time around and there's more to this feature so the cheese doesn't stand alone :P.  If you're the patient sort, go ahead and wait until Amazon offers it for rent for three or four bucks.  I purchased it in HD at full price and while I probably won't re-watch it too many times, I wasn't disappointed since having seen the first film and feeling I knew what I was in for, this one definitely exceeded my expectations, and that's always a good thing, especially these days given the sheer volume of sub-par comic based animation coming out on video and television.",1439856000,7,2990,4.590994371482176
