8220061,2,B000VUDSIA,"Ok. I only ordered it because Vanessa Redgrave was in it! Barely in it, but she was there.
The story is strange, the sets bright, but a strange movie overall. I have to admit I did not
really get into it and could not say where it is now. I just remember it being a very different
type of movie and not one I would recommend to anyone. The two stars are for Ms. Redgrave
who makes any movie she is in great.",1468886400,,407,3.9156626506024095
8220062,4,B000VUDSIA,"Very eccentric, more like a stage play than a movie, but well acted with great props. I found it engaging throughout with periodic humor and  great songs.",1457481600,,154,4.703703703703703
8220063,5,B000VUDSIA,"I absolutely loved this film on Netflix and had to order a copy to watch with friends. It was reasonably priced so that with the shipping added it cost about the same as if I found it in a store. It was also shipped very quickly and in great condition. I was a little concerned when I saw that it was shipped in a light envelope, but it wasn't damaged at all. I will definately be coming back for my film needs. Thank you!",1303344000,,422,4.035714285714286
8220064,1,B000VUDSIA,"I bought this movie on the basis of its 4-star amazon customer rating (overlooking the fact that it had only one single review).  It has very colorful sets and is imaginative and quirky--although not always in a particularly satisfying way.  In the first scene I thought that I had been sent a French musical by mistake.  Much of it spoofs old Hollywood gangster B-movies, except that it is in color, and set in Paris, and features eccentric chefs rather than gangsters, and isn't as well crafted (except for the eye catching sets). If I were a recent post-adolescent I probably would have enjoyed it more, but I spent most of the movie being bored or irritated and hoping that it would eventually have some redeeming quality (other than the delightful sets), and wishing that it had had some adult supervision in its creation.",1269907200,3,827,4.769230769230769
8220065,4,B000VUDSIA,"John Hurt and Vanessa Redgrave have only small but integral parts in this charming movie that Emma de Caunes as Fifi dominates with wit and style.  She's a brilliant chef who's hiding out in a diner because she's afraid and she's not even sure what she's afraid of.  The other characters are everything from profound to quirky and even insane.
Katherine who delivers the food Fifi makes seeks moments of solitude and asks deep questions of total strangers.  There's a chef in a neighboring restaurant who's created a rather questionable dish in revenge for being betrayed.  The other characters comprise sound boards for Fifi and Katherine as they both seek to find answers by asking odd and sometimes profound questions.
This movie made me smile often and left me trying to answer the questions this movie asked.",1220313600,4,813,4.912408759124087
