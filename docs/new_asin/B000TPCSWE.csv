8210263,1,B000TPCSWE,"All this $#!t is is just the foreign version of Fatal Attraction with a brief mix of failed revenge thrown in! This flick was poorly made, the story sucks, the subtitles are hard to see and read at times and noone worth giving damn about survives! The whole movie itself is just confusing. My personal opinion ""DON'T TOUCH THIS PIECE OF $#!T!"" Just to name actors who are much, much worse but any of their worthless flicks are better than this: David Chiang, Sonny Chiba, Dragon Lee, Billy Chong, and if you can find him Jhoon Rhee! LEAVE THIS $#!T ALONE! IT'S NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND IT NEVER WILL BE! DON'T BUY IT, DON'T RENT IT AND IF YOU JUST HAPPEN TO SEE IT ON THE CLEARANCE RACK JUST KEEP WALKING! To give you a better understanding of just how bad this movie is it clearly looks like a bad Japanese opera that was acted out by cleaned up but still drunk homeless people!",1248134400,2,878,4.327272727272727
