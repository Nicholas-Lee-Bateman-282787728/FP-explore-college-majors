2220505,4,B0007N19ZA,"Janeane Garofalo stars in this movie as a young woman who answers a personal ad in the paper as a sort of 'last chance'. she meets the man at a cafe but doesn't tell him who she is right away making for some light hearted fun before this movie takes a very unexpectedly dark turn. That's more info than you need. Janeane Garofalo does an amazing job in this movie! This is the best I've ever seen her. Her performance is funny, whimsy, and dark all at the same time. She shows a vulnerubility here that I've never seen in her before and it fits her fine.  The film has a mystery ending, one that leaves you wondering about the fate of one of the charachters without giving you many clues and this is one of the few imperfections in this movie. This is a love/compassion search story that's better and more watchable than ""Closer"" with performances at times better than any in ""Closer""",1109462400,8,884,4.390243902439025
2220506,5,B0007N19ZA,"This is a low budget, independent film--art film, I guess. Both the leads give powerful performances telling a poignant story of the insecurity and pain of daily life; the stuff everybody's life is made of. I love this sort of movie, but must admit it is not for everyone. It is NOT a happy ending, romantic comedy. In fact, it is not any kind of comedy. The power of the story and the performances rival ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Wolfe?"" Rouse is no Richard Burton, but does a credible job and Garofalo's performance compares well with any I've ever seen. The viewer can feel her agony, her desperation. The character reminds me of Cissy Spacek's in ""'Night Mama,"" another portrayal of a life so desperate and painful that ending it is a rational decision.

Another reviewer either here or at IMDB concluded that the director was at fault for what he deemed to be poor lighting, but the lighting, the occasional fuzziness in the scene all contribute to the somber, serious mood. So even when a kooky character says something bizarre, it remains clear the mood is not light-hearted. Again, this is not a comedy.",1354838400,4,1111,4.697435897435898
2220507,4,B0007N19ZA,"Great performances with a very tragic subject, irreversible depression.  A small cast and an artful production.  No spoilers but know the cover artwork is a little misleading.  Give it a watch for the performances...",1353196800,,216,5.294117647058823
2220508,4,B0007N19ZA,"I expected a rom-com from a young Janeane. Instead, the film's plot is a dark, brooding comedy (I'm not sure one should call it a comedy).

I thought Janeane's performance in ""The Matchmaker"" was her magnum opus, but now I am not sure. She gives an intense, capitvating performance in this film.

It should be considered must-see for Garofalo fans.",1349308800,,348,4.783333333333333
2220509,5,B0007N19ZA,"What a film!  Reading the back, I thought it was another fluff piece like the Truth About Cats and Dogs (which I liked, but good film it ain't).  This one is for the thinking crowd -- Janeane's character uses big words and everything and at first apologizes for it (and then forgets to as her character develops).  Although the ending is foreshadowed a bit, you can't help but feel hopeful for these main characters. Margaret Cho (as usual) is simply brilliant.  Give her a scene and she wipes the floor with it. Her first scene in this move is a classic. Great writing, great acting, great directing.  The lighting was too dark for me at times (hard to see the characters)and I still don't get the title of the film as it relates to the content - but this one is for people who don't want a film where everything is handed to them on a platter by a hamfisted waiter (director).  The dialogue was designed for smart adults -- not 8th grade boys -- refreshing!!",1280016000,,960,4.426136363636363
2220510,5,B0007N19ZA,"I love the subject matter of this movie, the whole dating thing is scary and who better to exploit it than janine garafalo herself.  I guess you would have to have a gothic outlook on life to enjoy this movie.  Considering the main character is bipolar, which I can relate to, anyone who suffers from this condition will connect with her character.  I praise Janine Garafalo for portraying this character so honestly and intuitively.  Mitch Rouse also did an incredible job, and he's hot.  Why did I include that in my review?  Because I'm bipolar!  And proud of it!",1225238400,3,566,4.656565656565657
2220511,4,B0007N19ZA,But then again I'm a big Janeane Garofalo fan.  I only bought it because she was in it.,1222128000,,87,3.8333333333333335
2220512,1,B0007N19ZA,"While her acting was good, even with an edge, I couldn't see the point for her making the film.  It was horribly disappointing, not uplifting at all.  I kept wanted to turn it off, yet I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't in my opinion.",1157328000,2,244,4.170212765957447
2220513,4,B0007N19ZA,"Sweethearts is worth seeing for one reason-Janeane Garofalo (she also co-produced the film).  She gives her best performance of her career.  She plays a complicated, very emotional woman (not unlike herself) who is looking for a companion for what may be her last night on Earth, as she says she wants to commit suicide.  She may be looking for someone to save her, or maybe not.  Janeane's performance is a tour-de-force of all human emotions, and it's quite remarkable.  She shows depth and substance that was indeed very rarely shown in the ""ironic"" 1990's.  Much of Janeane's film work is awful, which is really a shame, as she actually has talent (which is on vivid display here).  I never understood why she became a comic, as she has a very serious and intelligent side to her.  Comics have great difficulty in taking anything serious, and are, more often than not, not particularly bright (except for the great ones, like Lenny Bruce, Bill Hicks, Richard Pryor, Rodney Dangerfield, etc., etc).  Luckily, Janeane got into acting, which is where she belongs.  This woman can act if she's just given the right material.  Too often she chooses horrible projects (like some horrible made for TV movies and TV shows past their prime, like The West Wing and 24).  One feels there's a huge low self esteem issue in her, a real one, that she feels she can't really do anything too complex.  I say BS.

Unfortunately, the film itself is a little sloppy at times, and the lead actor (Mitch Rouse) is barely adequate.  His performance is very weak, especially when compared to the magnificence of Janeane's performance, and it subsequently drags the film down.  The comic relief of Margaret Cho and Bobcat Goldwaith is out of place as well.  For some reason, the film never made it to theaters, and was released directly to video around 1998.  Luckily, it's on DVD now.  While the film itself isn't perfect, Garofalo's performance is really something to behold....",1137801600,15,1960,4.831831831831832
2220514,5,B0007N19ZA,"This movie blew me away.  I either like a movie, or I don't, but I never spend hours obsessing over a story... I obsessed over this one.  I thought it was going to be a movie along the same lines as 'The Truth About Cats & Dogs' (which I really liked), but I was way off the mark.  Once 'Sweethearts' was over, I hit rewind and watched it again. When it ended, I made my husband watch it with me.  He hit rewind and watched it again.  It is such a thought-provoking story, a true antithesis of the basic Hollywood romantic comedy. The foundation of the story, the relationship that develops, is beautiful because it doesn't sugar-coat anything.  Janeane's performance is flawless, and you feel each moment with her.  The ending is gut-wrenching, but is integral to the story... If it were changed to match the banality of the ""Hollywood Ending"", the movie would suffer greatly.  Do yourself a favor and buy (or at least rent!) this movie.  After being a rare item for almost eight years, it is finally available on DVD.  Margaret Cho and Mitch Rouse are wonderful, as well.",1130457600,17,1073,4.541666666666667
2220515,5,B0007N19ZA,"When I 1st rented this, it was due entirely to Janeane Garofalo being in it ( I'd watch her read the paper )  & what seemed like an interesting, off-beat  story idea. It is the only movie that has given her enough substance to really sink her teeth into on screen & a pleasant suprise for those who like their entertainment dark & complicated.

 The Set-up : An average guy ( Mitch Rouse ) places a personal ad. A gal responds ( Jeanane Garofalo ) & what results is the 'blind date from hell' including a gun, a hostage  & a caustic bartender ( Margaret Cho ).

  What transpires feels almost like a play, sparse and character driven. There is some comedy ( low key ) and romance ( unexpected ), but what really makes this stand out is some dark, intense, emotional scenes that don't pull their punches & an ending that avoids tidy completion in favor of ambiguous thought provocation.

 Kudos to Aleks Horvat who has writing / directing / producing credits - he really went out of his way to create something different without insulting anyone's intelligence, & Jeanene Garofalo, for giving what has to be one of her finest performances.",1120003200,15,1138,4.534313725490196
