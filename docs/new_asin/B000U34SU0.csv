8212027,1,B000U34SU0,"What a coup. The Woods Have Eyes Productions landed The Woods Have Eyes! In an attempt to dupe the American public, The Woods Have Eyes is neither a sequel to The Woods nor The Hills Have Eyes. Director Anthony Indelicato has peppered his cast with grating Italian stereotypes. There isn't a single likeable character in the entire movie. Not the teenage kids, the little sibling or his buddies, the parents, the psychotic hillbilly family, or the entire sheriff's department. Let's say they're... obnoxioso. There's more tension between the ""good guys"" than there is the cast and the killers. The kids go off on a hike, and it turns into the freakin' Blair Witch Project. The older kids try to scare the younger kids by bringing them to the fabled ""Cappy."" Things go south from there. I'm not sure how the hillbillies went under the radar for so long judging by their reaction to having kids on their property. Oh, if only they killed off the ENTIRE cast. I can't believe someone had the nads to give this movie the ending that they did. Oscar fever: Carmine's meltdown at the 78 minute mark. ""LET'S GET OUTTA HERE"" count: 7.",1371600000,,1126,4.691919191919192
8212028,1,B000U34SU0,"Title of the review says it all.  IT'S WORSE THAN PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.  Which, according to most people, is the WORST movie EVER MADE!",1265846400,,138,4.269230769230769
8212029,1,B000U34SU0,"I HONESTLY DIDNT NOTICE BEFORE I BOUGHT THIS THE 1 STAR RATINGS ITS RECEIVED. ALLOW ME TO LOWER THE AVERAGE BY GIVING  IT A -3 STAR RATING. THIS MOVIE IS TO BE HATED OR EVEN SKIPPED FOR 2 REASONS. 1ST- ENTIRELY TALENTLESS GROUP OF ACTORS. COMPLETELY STUPID TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE TYPE OF IDEAS/EFFECTS THAT BROKE NO NEW GROUND. 2ND- ONE CHARACTER IS MENTALLY CHALLENGED DUE TO HAVING BEEN IN A BAD CAR ACCIDENT. BUT HE IS PORTRAYED IN A MOCKING WAY; NO ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO MAYBE BE ORIGONAL SOMEHOW. THIS IS HARD TO SAY, BUT REMEMBER HOW YOU MAY HAVE "" MADE FUN"" OF SOMEONE WITH A DISABILITY WHEN YOU WERE TOO YOUNG TO KNOW IT WAS WRONG TO DO? HOW UNKIND CHILDREN CAN BE UNTIL THEY MATURE? WELL- THATS HOW THIS DISABLED PERSON IS PORTRAYED. I COULDNT FINISH WATCHING IT. IM ALL FOR MOCKING SOMEONE WHO DESERVES IT. BUT ANYONE WITH A BRAIN INJURY( character has red scar down forehead) IS COMPLETELY UNCOOL. AND LASTLY, COME TO THINK OF IT- THERES ABSOLUTELY NO ACTION WHATSOEVER THAT BLU RAY TECHNOLOGY BENEFITS FROM. COMPLETE  WASTE OF MONEY.",1260489600,2,1044,4.577540106951871
8212030,1,B000U34SU0,"I saw this movie for under 10 dollars and I thought it was a spin off of ""The Hills Have Eyes.""  It definitely was not.  You couldn't have paid me 10 dollars to watch this.  As a matter of fact, I will end up throwing it away in the garbage.  Literally.  The quality was worse than a regular DVD when watching it on my PS3 and it's supposed to be ""Blu Ray.""  It was a complete rip off.  DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!",1251590400,8,408,3.902439024390244
8212031,1,B000U34SU0,"This movie deserves only 1/2 a star, a rip off of the movie ""Wrong Turn"", but this one should be titled ""Trash Burn"" it is terrible, nothing in this movie is appealing from the actors to the script to the directing, it should have gone directly to the incinerator and the actors should have returned their pay checks for this cimemtic garbage.",1251244800,8,343,4.548387096774194
8212032,4,B000U34SU0,"Is a very entertaining film, a bunch of city kids lost in the woods, most of the trama happends outdoors, the 3 killers have a very comvincing roll, a crazy one, the cold one and the indestructible one, you know the type,..he gets cut,shot etc, and still alive.!
the acting is acceptable, no a lot of special effects,which better that Bad especial effects in low budget movies,. however very much achieves the purpose of the storie,.. the ending is unexpected, I think you will find it entertaining and it worth to watch.",1238630400,,521,4.673913043478261
8212033,3,B000U34SU0,"Alright, so it's a low budget horror movie, but it's NOT awful.  It's NOT The Hills Have Eyes or anything.  It's got gore, it's got death, it's got inbred type hicks in the woods chasing city kids and scaring the heck outta them.  It drags on at some points but it has MORE than just a couple kills, as the other reviewer said.  There's decapitation, and more, not to spoil it too much.  It's not so low budget that the camera shakes and the acting is completely TERRIBLE, it's just not your high end type of theater movie.  If you can pick it up CHEAP, like 5.00 or under, it's worth a watch if you're a TRUE slasher film fan.",1204502400,7,627,4.183333333333334
