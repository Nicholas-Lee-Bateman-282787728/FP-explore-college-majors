4851697,3,B005OA4Y9O,"This documentary was quite impressive that it does reflect the current scene in ""dance culture"" that is to some extent going mainstream in the US. However I do have some doubts, that it does however just emphasize on genres of ""house, dubstep, and commercialized drum & bass"". With the exception of 'Above & Beyond', it ignores  the ""trance and progressive house"" genre, which in fact is taking up a huge storm in the Europe and the rest of the world, Dj's as diverse as ALY & FILA, ALEX M.O.R.P.H., ARMIN VAN BUUREN, and SOLARSTONE had such an impact on the TRANCE scene, that thier is no mention at all of thier contribution to the dance music scene....",1336348800,3,655,4.598290598290598
4851698,5,B005OA4Y9O,This documentary did a great job of capturing the EDC experience. There were many times during the film where my jaw dropped because of the awe produced by such a large crowd that attends. It is well rounded an certainly long enough. There are interviews with some great DJ's as well as performers. Every aspect of it is beautiful and the music gives good vibes. If you are planning on going to EDC or just want to get a fell for the experience you should buy it.,1333065600,,463,4.333333333333333
4851699,5,B005OA4Y9O,I have never been to Electric Daisy Carnival(yet!) but I have been to many EDM shows over the past 20 years. The dvd is great! I put it in and let it run about 5 times. I love the candid interviews and the way the whole story is told. I highly recommend this to any dance music fan.,1329436800,3,282,3.8793103448275863
4851700,5,B005OA4Y9O,i have been to a many of insomniacs events and i have been waiting for the dvd to come out for a very long time. i had watched this last night with my boy friend and it literaly felt like i was there in person. every pan out on the crowd gives you the chills and makes you wish you could go forward in time and be at the next big edc event. its about two hours of video and its one of the best music documentary i have ever seen there is nothing like it to compare it to and i would recomend it to everyone! ps. the music and dj interviews were amazing!,1328918400,3,553,3.8173913043478263
4851701,1,B005OA4Y9O,"I thought it was full concert, but it wasn't. Wasting money to purchase this video. look @ youtube is much better....",1328918400,3,117,4.619047619047619
4851702,5,B005OA4Y9O,"Wow, watching this makes me want to go to the next event. So many great perfomers, acrobatics, carnival rides, and of course the music.",1328227200,3,135,4.666666666666667
4851703,5,B005OA4Y9O,"This was an amazing film. The director not only showed that each and every performer is amazing, but they really were able to show the crowd and how they felt about this music festival. There is no hate, no fights, just love and music. It really shows how the underground house music scene has grown into something, that we can all relate too, almost like, a way of life.

This was beyond amazing. I highly recommend, buying and watching over and over and over.

4851704,5,B005OA4Y9O,"if you have ever been to one of insomniacs shows then you already know what to expect. This documentary captures the ever growing spirit of dance music. i was lucky enough to attend the carnival in las vegas and let me tell you what, if they filmed everything like i think they did then we will soon see a movie about las vegas. this 2 hour plus film is such a work of art, and the music is just as perfect. a must buy for electronic music fans!",1326153600,3,445,4.068181818181818
4851705,5,B005OA4Y9O,"This film is captivating from start to finish. This is a must-have for festival fans. Kevin Kerslake has captured the spirit, energy and the creativity of Electric Daisy Carnival and you're along for the ride -- and what a ride it is! Costumed performers join the DJs on stage for an added visual treat! You get your own back stage pass to EDC with a peek into what goes on behind the scenes. I look forward to seeing more of Kerslake's work. I would give this film 5 stars easily!",1326153600,3,481,4.355555555555555
4851706,5,B005OA4Y9O,"I recently had the chance to watch this documentary and it honestly left me speechless. They took everyone's perspective, dj's, performers, and even the party goers and made it into an amazing documentary that music lovers can enjoy. I have been going to the Electric Daisy Carnival for about 4 years now and to see it in a movie is a great thing, it almost feels like you are there again. They did a real good job at catching peoples experience's and I give it two thumbs up. Its a beautiful scene with amazing people contributing, and  it really opens your eyes to a whole new world that is on a fast progressive move. If your into music, big crowds, and astonishing performers than this movie will be worth all your time!",1321228800,24,724,4.484848484848484
4851707,5,B005OA4Y9O,"... excitement and positive energy ... -  feel the crowd and see what they need ... - this is what you feel in heart and mind ...a living Circus Sole Performance ... - EDM = the vibe, the base, the energy = don't miss out .. just a beautiful crowd and awesome event ... been around the world ... put your hands UP ... ready ?? 100,000 can't be wrong ... THIS IS AWESOME ... YOU NEED TO GET IT ...",1390867200,,396,3.888888888888889
4851708,5,B005OA4Y9O,"love this dvd! always brings back good memories from when it use to be held in LA. the music, the people, etc good times",1364428800,,120,4.041666666666667
4851709,5,B005OA4Y9O,"I watch this over and over and it's just as uplifting and fun to watch as the first time. This is as close as you get to actually attending Electric Daisy or another event like it with the same ""house"" theme like Love Parade,which I attended in Berlin in 1997, in your own living room with surround sound. Mmmmmmm.",1359849600,,314,4.338983050847458
4851710,3,B005OA4Y9O,"Purchased this for husband.  The documentary showed footage from EDC in LA, not Vegas.  Was hoping for some footage from the first year that EDC was in Vegas.  Still fun to watch though...",1359331200,,188,4.636363636363637
4851711,5,B005OA4Y9O,"Awesome documentary for people into this scene. It gives you an inside look at things that happen behind the scenes at one of these festivals and interviews a couple of EDM artists (mainly Kaskade). I wish this documentary moved at a faster pace, but it is a documentary after all. The quality of the film is good, but it isn't blu-ray quality so keep that in mind.

I've been to EDC 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and in all honesty 2009 was the best. There's nothing like the feeling of being a part of a 100k person rave at the LA Coliseum (interesting fact: the 1984 Olympic Opening Ceremony was held here).The modern day EDC Vegas is cool, but the crowd is spread out over several massive stages rather than 1 huge stage like at the LA Coliseum so you don't get that same vibe with the crowd. Maybe one day EDC will return to the Coliseum...",1347408000,,849,4.3734177215189876
4851712,3,B005OA4Y9O,Iv been going to EDC for 4 or so years and have been in the scene since 02.  It was nice to relive some of the moments of EDC 2010 the last year they held it in LA at USC.  I don't really know if it captured the full essence of the party for me.  It was an interesting insight on what the DJ's thought about the party and the history of some of the people behind the masks but I got somewhat bored (and i was watching this on an airplane).  I was actually hoping that EDC 2011 Vegas was in the video but it wasnt.  It didn't get me hyped up for the next party like their commercials usually do.  Still my favorite memory of that party was in the film.  BALOONS DURING KASKADES SET!,1346025600,,681,3.927007299270073
4851713,3,B005OA4Y9O,"I'm not a dance music fan but had heard so much about EDC I wanted to see the film. The film is an overview on the founding of the event, profiles of dancers and performers. The live music shots are great but should have been a seperate disc of just live music. The crowd and dancer histories were interesting. Overall it was too much detail on things that could have covered their own doc, and not enough music to be a concert film.",1343001600,,433,4.228915662650603
4851714,5,B005OA4Y9O,"I wish I could have seen all the costumes and dance acts. This movie is about a concert of sorts that goes on in L.A. They have dj's spin records and make wild beats of music that the audience responds to with happiness. They all dress up like a mardi gras, the costumes and make-up are so fun and like a circus that I went to a long time ago with my mom. It is just so well done. The artists are unique and really good at what they do. There are rides and they spin in the electric sky with letting go abandon, spinning with rhythm all around in the sky, in their ears, whats next, listen to more music, dance, spin, eat fun food, watch all the color, be happy. I want to go to this someday.",1341792000,,692,3.985611510791367
4851715,2,B005OA4Y9O,"The potential was definitely there BUT the non-stop interviews and pointless back stage shots dimmed what could of been an explosive tour thru the edc nightlife.  also, way too much black eyed peas frontman, will i am.  no p.l.u.r. to be found here and no desire to re-watch.  this was never what e.d.c was supposed to be about.  let ME direct the next one 'cause this is a fail.",1341532800,,379,4.449275362318841
4851716,4,B005OA4Y9O,"Although this DVD does give the viewer an excellent idea of what EDC looks, feels and sounds like, I'd MUCH prefer more attention and camera time paid to the artist while on onstage performing and then in an interview behind the scenes.  The generation that drives the EDC fan base has to be applauded for their energy and passion, but it's the artists that are bringing the true art of EDM to the people.  There is far too much shaky footage of the EDC audience and carnival performers.  Perhaps there should be 2 DVD's.  One focusing on the controlled chaos and love that is an EDC experience and one DVD focusing on the hugely talented and tirelessly working artists bringing it to the masses.",1336953600,7,696,4.588709677419355

8481116,4,B005OA4Y9O,"Good documentary. Very fun to watch. Only thing is that it is outdated since 2010, because the festival experience has changed by virtue of change in venues (from LA Colliseum to Las Vegas Racetrack). Won't say for the better or worse, but it is vastly different. Not sure if Under The Electric Sky captures the experience as this does (for that time).",1472428800,,352,4.693548387096774

8481118,5,B005OA4Y9O,"I show everyone I know this documentary. I wish there were more out there like this. It's so important to provide a first person perspective of the cultures within the younger generations and show it in a positive light. This is all true and real - the EDC culture is one where you literally feel as if you can touch good vibes in the air. Go to a concert like this and you will see, nothing but people literally so high on life they can't even handle it :). It's beautiful!",1450310400,,474,4.21978021978022
8481119,1,B005OA4Y9O,"So glad EDC moved out of LA. This event was poorly managed and it was always very difficult to move around from one stage to another. Lots of choke points where the crowd would bunch up. People get hurt. Total buzz kill. I notice they edited out the parts where security were beating people for jumping fences that should not have been there, just so they could get close to the stage. Also they did not show the tunnel where all those people got jammed in the concrete doorway, and this poor lil raver chick had her arm broken from all the people crushing on her. No footage of the 15 yo girl OD'ing on bad exctasy either! How's this a real documentary of that years event?? Hmmm... It sucked so badly that I could not watch the whole thing, and I felt compelled to return it. Save your money and purchase Under the Electric Sky if you wanna know what EDC's all about!",1417132800,,869,4.304878048780488

8481121,5,B005OA4Y9O,although this makes me sad ( since Ive missed EDC for different stupid reasons every year so far) It is still one of my favorite documentaries. It has a great little set by the late DJ AM (RIP). I like to have it on in the background when Im cleaning because of the music :),1395964800,,274,4.0
8481122,5,B005OA4Y9O,"More specifically, I should say that If you live in the USA and you're into EDM, this concert is for YOU! EDM is coming of age in the USA and this concert is a great demonstration of that fact.  Europe, South America, etc. have been celebrating large EDM festivals for decades, and now the USA has 'Electric Daisy Carnival'...!!! I thoroughly enjoyed watching this DVD.",1394928000,,369,4.676923076923077
8481123,5,B005OA4Y9O,My boyfriend is building his DJ career and this DVD motivates him every time he watches it.  I also enjoyed it and would recommend it.,1393718400,,134,4.36
