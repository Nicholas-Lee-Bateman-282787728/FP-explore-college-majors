There is a twist at the end of the movie, which is almost worth it.  Also, it was the second to the last time Glenn Ford was seen on screen.  Acting by Ford and Jan-Michael Vincent was less than good.  I gave it 3 stars because of Glenn Ford, and it's Mobile location ;)  For you men, you might like it because of Tracy Lords.  Otherwise, not sure I can recommend it???",1516752000,,529,4.427083333333333
8186830,2,6301826779,"Unfortunately, the only reason to watch this flick  (Traci Lords BODY) is never realized. Instead of a good shower scene or  -  heck anything could have been written that would have showcased her beauty , we are subjected to her ""acting"" talent. We do get an alcohol dazed J- Mike Vincent looking zoned out most of the time and poor Glenn Ford trying to make the most out of this horrible script Tex Cobb is actually the best character actor in the film! - Skip this one unless you just want to see their faces on screen.",1512172800,,521,4.350515463917525
8186831,5,6301826779,"Ok im giving this movie 5 Stars because it had an Awesome Truck Crash torwards the End of the movie were a Chevy Pickup Truck goes over a Parking Garage and Slams down on the Ground and It is Awesome. As for the Movie itself it is alright its about a Serial Killer Killing People and its got Some Action in it to But overall it is Good only because of the Truck Crash Scene if you like Crashes You,ll like this Movie.",1356825600,2,417,4.036144578313253
8186832,5,6301826779,"OK, so maybe Traci is not the ""Star"" star of this flick but it deserves attention in that it addresses issues that were rarely, if ever, brought up in movies of this era. Well written, almost Hitchcock-ish and very much entertaining. Sandahl Bergman does a very convicing job alongside Lords in this film. Fans of Jan-Michael Vincent (""The Winds of War"", ""Big Wednesday"" & the series Airwolf) plus Randal ""Tex"" Cobb (Former Heavyweight boxer turned actor with ""The Champ"", ""Liar Liar"" and the series In The Heat of the Night to his credit) should enjoy the movie also.",1327536000,5,568,4.8061224489795915
8186833,5,6301826779,"Being a long standing fan of that absolutely beautiful women, Traci Lords (may I dare to say, since we both had been 16/17yrs). This is another DVD to ad to my collection",1257897600,7,170,4.34375
8186834,3,6301826779,"Movie was ok, wasn't as good as expected but ok. Service on the was also satisfactory.",1236384000,5,86,4.4375
8186835,2,6301826779,"Jimmy Clayton is a race car driver who has visions of the murders that have been happening locally. The police do not believe him and he is not aware of what is happening to him. When he has a vision of his sister Gina being murdered, he needs to make an investigation of his own. With the help of local reporter Gloria Freedman, Jimmy tries to determine who the murderer is and analyse his visions.
I add that the two compelling reasons for any interest in this flick is that it is one of the last screen appearances of the LEGENDARY Glenn Ford, and secondly, contains one hot Traci Lords.",1082332800,,590,4.372727272727273
