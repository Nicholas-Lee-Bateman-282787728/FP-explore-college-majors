3509723,5,B001CDLAT4,"I use the word ""profound"" about once a year.  This video gets the one for this year!  I imagine an otherworldly alien being sent to Earth with the simple assignment to bring back the very essence of Earth's physical being and the essence of its living inhabitants.  No need for a plot, or a real beginning or an end, and there is no dialogue.  I know of no other movie experience like this.  One for the ages.  Utterly mesmerizing and deeply fulfilling.  Reality becomes magic.",1492300800,,477,4.541176470588235
3509724,5,B001CDLAT4,"This is a brilliant film and a regular in our Blu-ray player. The first time I saw it was more than twenty years ago and it left a lasting impression on me. After the release of Samsara we decided to order it for our home movie collection, and in many ways it is my favorite of the two films, offering a more intimate look at the inhabitants of Earth. I found it to be more of a sequel to Samsara, instead of a prequel, and we are routinely turning it on and settling into a quiet meditative space while savoring every image, every sound, every breath. Having been a longtime fan of the music of DeadCanDance and Lisa Gerrard, both films are to be treasured. I hope there's atleast one more of these in the works, sometime on down the road. Thank you Ron Fricke and Mark Magidson!",1492300800,,780,4.277027027027027

Watch this when you are sipping wine with a group of friends that appreciate fine art, it will stir conversation. The visuals are absolutely stunning and you find yourself backing up the blu-ray and rewatching scenes over and over. The burning oil rigs with the bagpipe music is absolutely stunning.

3509818,5,B001CDLAT4,"I was pretty sure no film could hold my attention for 1 1/2 hours with no narration whatsoever, but this film is simply brilliant!  It's meant to be watched quietly with out interruptions or visiting.  The music and alternating between cultures, timing and lighting is remarkable and mesmerizing.  At times rushing faster and faster in time lapse and slowing down to lingering frames of penetrating faces and shadows, both nature, cultures, beliefs and customs evoke emotions from deep within and cause the viewer to search his/her own soul for clarity.  We spend our lives having no real idea what it is to live life under a different set of beliefs and ideals; we walk the earth making a clear distinction between nature, animals and people----each in their own place; one superior to the other.  We think we're all different, but under the skillful hand and mind-boggling perception of Ron Fricke, one is left to question if we really are.  We see the ties that bind us all together in the rhythms of life.  What an unforgettable experience.  Why this film only won 1 award astounds me.",1458950400,,1089,4.817204301075269

3509843,5,B001CDLAT4,This has to be my favorite movie of all time.  The subtle storytelling of a society out of balance is second to none.  The rich imagery and powerful soundtrack evokes emotions not commonly felt in front of a screen.  I would recommend this film to every single human on this planet.  One caveat of the Blu-Ray vs the digital copy one can obtain via torrent would be the lack of subtitles available-- it's really nice to know where in the world you are viewing and I wasn't able to figure out how to do this on the Blu-Ray version of the film.,1449964800,,542,4.284313725490196

However, whatever you want to know about the film you learn only by viewing the extras on the disc, and THEN the real appreciation for the film grows exponentially!!  When you hear what the cinematographers and producers went through to achieve this incredible collection of shots, you will likely want to view the film again, and will then have a keener sense of why it is so special.  Personally, I had a hard time getting into it at first because it went all over the place, with no explanation of what you were viewing, where it was filmed, or why, but after listening to the extra feature, I thoroughly appreciated the film.  It is truly unique...and really quite stunning!!",1443139200,,841,4.894366197183099

I'm still not sure if it is as powerful and impacting as Samsara but it is truly incredible. It's basically an hour and a half of eye candy and seldom seen human interactions mixed with great music, but contrasted on each other (the scenes) in a way that truly makes you look at the world, if not think about it, differently than before.  The remastering far surpasses what I expected from a film released in 1992.  I really do wish there were more out there like this as I have thoroughly enjoyed this and Samsara.

3509924,5,B001CDLAT4,"BARAKA is a 1993 film, shot by Ron Fricke in some 24 countries, that is a sort of documentary on three universal themes: 1) the grandeur of the natural world, from the peaks of Everest to low deserts, 2) the oneness of the human race illustrated by juxtaposing almost identical shots from vastly separated cultures, and 3) the desire for a connection with something transcendent. Shot in 70mm film, watching the Bluray on a projector or a large-screen television offers one of the most visually stunning cinematic experiences around. There is no dialogue or voiceover, no characters, but the enormous amount of footage is presented here in a way that gives BARAKA a gripping dramatic arc, and it's a sequence that, on repeated viewings, increasingly seems the one logical way in which all this could have been edited.

With unquenchable anthropological curiosity, Fricke identifies commonalities that link us all. A Japanese mafioso's tattoos, for example, are followed immediately by a shot of the same on an indigenous resident of Papua New Guinea. But it's not only exotic tribalism. A shot of affluent Japanese schoolgirls looking at the camera is mirrored later by an almost identical shot of low-caste girls in Calcutta. Nonetheless, don't expect a mushy call for tolerance; Fricke's editing indeed makes a convincing case for appreciating differences, but there is nuance.

Fricke's occasional use of footage from churches, mosques, temples, etc. is less an advocacy for belief in religion than an extension of the commonalities he identifies. Human beings have an urge for contemplation as solace among the complicated and sometimes senseless world around them, and they draw on inner sources of mercy to go against the cruelty that people show to their fellow man. The consequences of a world cut adrift from calm and compassion are shown during a heartbreaking sequence that ranges from Auschwitz and the Cambodian killing fields to homeless across the globe and teenage prostitutes in a Bangkok nightclub.

The footage is accompanied by an array of musical pieces which help to set the mood for each series of shots: minimalist loops form the soundtrack for scenes of industrial production, we hear harsh bagpipes as the camera tours the burning oil fields of Kuwait, and Dead Can Dance's ""The Host of Seraphim"" plays during an indictment of poverty worldwide. Some of musicians involved are rather New-Agey and would never have a place in my music listening, but when integrated into the film they are remarkably effective. The 5.1 surround sound excellently balances cinematic effect and faithfulness to the scenes portrayed.

I've watched BARAKA many times now, each time discovering many new things and always being moved, whether to pity (Calcutta garbage-pickers) or wonder (the unreal glittering hall of Shiraz's Shahcheragh mausoleum).  I would certainly rank it among my favourite films. Will you like it? That's hard to say. BARAKA is my go-to Bluray when friends and family want to try out my fancy home theatre setup with HD projector and surround sound, and while some of them have been just as stunned as I am, others don't really care. Apparently many people, even those with a well-rounded education, don't have much curiosity for things outside their own everyday experience, and so Fricke's survey of world cultures doesn't resonate with them.

(Note that while Fricke created a 2011 follow-up called SAMSARA, I would recommend staying away from it, as it is less focused and only repeats BARAKA to diminishing effect.)",1420156800,,3548,5.161739130434783

3509988,4,B001CDLAT4,"I'm a little confused about some of the reviews mentioning transfers to different media.  It's something that can always be an issue when either taking a low quality (low resolution cameras) video and trying to take it up to something like HD, or going the other way, and in this case Baraka was shot with a 70mm camera, which is something more suitable for displays on large screens, meaning very large, such as IMAX.  To scale this down to bluray, there is already a loss of information, which means a little loss on clarity.  For people who have any expectations of this looking great on a DVD though, the loss of information is so great that I don't see why you would even want to buy this as a DVD.  Add to that the issues of displaying a DVD on a large HDTV, which is NEVER really sharp.  So in the case of something like this, where the original media has more data than what a typical home system can display (except for the new 4k TVs), and then it has to get chopped way down to go onto a format that is 720 pixels long (480p), and then you want to take that BACK UP to an image that is 1920 pixels long (1080p)?  You are taking losses both ways.

My suggestion would be to buy this as a blu-ray, and not the 8k version because there are no TVs that can show it and it's a waste of money, unless of course you can get it cheaper than the remastered bluray version.  So because it was recorded with cameras that are really only suitable for display on something like an IMAX screen or to make a beautiful display at any theatre, you can't expect too much when it has to be scaled way back to make it a disc format.  And honestly if you are buying something for the visuals, you need to buy HD and show it on a big TV.",1404000000,,1726,4.1437125748503
3509989,5,B001CDLAT4,"If you know nothing about this film, do not be fooled by the cover.

With all due respect, Baraka is NOT a typical National Geographic or BBC-style documentary - It's a visual meditation on life on Earth. Some images are beautiful, some are disturbing (not for kids/the squeamish), and some are puzzling, but if you can stick with it, Baraka is a memorable experience that will make you reflect on life.

The Blu-Ray version of Baraka will not disappoint fans - looks and sounds pretty much as good as you could hope for (some very minor banding in some of the dark/night scenes).

The supplemental content for the Blu-Ray edition is very well done, it you are into behind-the-scenes stuff.

I've watched it several times since receiving it and each time it gives me goose bumps. I was worried about the fact it had no talking about what I was I witnessing but it made it that much more powerful. For the price if you are thinking about ordering it just click the button. You will not be disappointed. My next purchase will be the Criterion Collection of the Qatsi Trilogy. I can only hope they are as mind blowing as this.,1390521600,,551,4.158878504672897

As lovers of the natural world and staunch opponents of human and animal cruelty, we watched most of Baraka with confusion and some degree of horror. What was this movie all about, and why would someone make something like this, that to us, bordered on the demonic?  We put the DVD back into the free box, saying, "" Oh ho, now we know why it was in the free box."" After many years of emotional and spiritual growth, we ventured to see Baraka again. This time instead of horror, we saw a gorgeously filmed attempt to reveal the sublime mystery of the interconnection of all things. Yes, there is suffering. But there is also joy, and the two are inextricably entwined. I highly recommend Baraka - but only if you are ready.",1387756800,,871,4.3765432098765435

The organization and message that is delivered without a single word, is definitely something that is not an easy task to pull off, but this movie does not disappoint. If you want to see the world from a different perspective, experience an unspoken look into the different cultures of the world, and see how culture clearly does not change the human spirit, you will enjoy this movie. There are a few scenes in the movie that will make you wonder why we behave the way we do, when it is clear that our similarities as humans are not fully seperated by culture, but only appear that way on the outside. One thing to keep in mind when watching this movie, it is not a new movie, the filming was done in 1993, so it's not going to have the sound and detail that a newer BluRay would have.

My match teacher showed it to us because a friend had made the film, and he found it to be powerful enough to share despite it not being related to math in any obvious way.  It's filled with breathtaking vistas, shots of ancient cultures and rituals (Whirling Dervishes, anyone?), and intimate looks at some of our modern marvels' darker sides (that chicken factory scene is still disturbing to this day).

3510204,5,B001CDLAT4,"I've seen several of my top 10 films only once because I can remember almost everything from one viewing. It's rare for me to watch any film more than once except for Baraka.

In the past 4 years I've watched this film about 10 times.

Baraka doesn't have a word of dialogue; the film communicates its message using the language of imagery, music, and juxtaposition.

This isn't an narrative film, it's visual poetry. The viewer is taken across several nations and cultures. The horror and triumphs of the human race are painted across the screen in a beautiful mosaic.

The title, Baraka, means `blessing' in Hebrew, Arabic and Arabic-influenced languages. And that's exactly what this film is, a blessing.

Do yourself a favor and watch this on blu-ray with the biggest screen possible. Even though this film was released in 1992, no other film has matched its cinematography. It's a dream of mine to shoot a film in 65mm or 70mm someday just as Ron Fricke did.

Ron Fricke did almost everything himself, the cinematography, building the camera, editing, and the color grade.

Oh but that's not all, Mr. Fricke has been working on his newest film over the past 20 years and it's coming out for wide release this August! It's titled Samsara, which means the eternal cycle of birth, suffering, death, and rebirth.

This ""film"" is a rich mixture of aberrant human behavior contrasted with blissful tranquility of a baboon in a hot tub. (Not too hard to read between those lines.) Be aware that in some countries showing the genitals of pre-pubescent African females is considered child pornography. This blu ray version will take you from the bizarre all male primitive rituals in some stone age culture to the mind numbing frenetic repetitiveness of a sped up modern assembly lines and Manhattan traffic that goes on and on and on... For those of you who are pan pipe lovers you will get your recommended lifetime dose plus some. A classic example that taste has nothing to do with budget.

3510210,5,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka (1992)
Documentary, 96 minutes
Directed by Ron Fricke

There are few films that I think everyone should watch at least once, but Baraka may be one of them. Perhaps it should be shown in schools too?

Baraka is a word in the ancient Sufi language meaning ""the thread that weaves life together"" and the film contains no dialogue and no explanation. It's a series of images taken from 24 different countries. Some of the images show scenes of animal life or extreme beauty; others show human rituals and the effects of war or poverty. The result provokes a lot of thought if you are open to such things.

Shot on 70mm film, the Blu-ray presentation is among the best live action films the format has to offer. Some of the images are located in places that are not normally accessible to people. An image of an underground cavern springs to mind.

If you follow the film closely, you are likely to be moved. The beauty is breathtaking, but some of the sadder scenes could take your breath away for a different reason. The contrast between good and evil is one of the themes running throughout the documentary. You might also question the path you have chosen in your life when you realize that most humans are continually racing toward something and few stop to appreciate the beauty in their lives.

The special features are informative and almost as interesting as the film itself. If you are curious about where the images came from, the special features answer most of your questions.",1330473600,,1491,4.675572519083969
3510211,5,B001CDLAT4,"Simply the most amazing cinematography I've ever seen.  The images alongside the music are breathtaking, and it really creates a unique perspective on life and how ""it"" interacts with itself.  An unbelievably accurate, beautiful expression of the word ""Baraka"".",1329955200,,261,5.666666666666667
3510212,5,B001CDLAT4,"The film, the transfer, the experience is nothing short of pure magic. Without a standard conventional plotline, baraka weaves us through the fabric of human existence and silently comments on our mark upon the earth and ourselves. They say a picture is worth a thousand words and every single frame of baraka states that which must be known and intellectually warps us into reassesing ourselves as human beings. The quality of the blu-ray is absolutely mind blowing and completely lives up to the review of ""high quality transfer to date"". This purchase is absolutely worth every penny.

3510223,5,B001CDLAT4,"If you're not into more cerebral, visual methods of storytelling, Baraka is probably not for you. But if you ARE into visual storytelling and thought-provoking visuals, I think you will enjoy it. Heck, you might even enjoy it regardless. Many people do.

The visuals are outstanding. The ""HD"" in this film looks more ""HD"" than your average blu-ray movie. The picture is so pristine and sharp it seems to transcend reality. The camera uses such deep focus that you can see everything at once - and everything is beautiful.

Enjoy. In fact, keep enjoying. This is something you'll be watching more than once.",1328140800,,606,4.87378640776699
3510224,5,B001CDLAT4,"""Baraka"" means ""blessing,"" and each of the scenes in this movie aims to show the huge variety of life and its rhythm on earth. From the opening shot of a monkey in a waterfall, to acts of prayer, to chicks in factories, to African dance, to Japanese theater, Baraka sweeps slowly, inexorably through small pieces of the human experience. It is a stunningly beautiful movie, sometimes fast and sometimes slow, ever changing, never the same--like life. Fans of Koyaanisqatsi will recognize director Ron Fricke's cinematographic style. This is not at all a plot-driven movie--watch it if you are looking for an experience.",1326844800,,619,5.078431372549019
3510225,3,B001CDLAT4,"This film starts with some great scenes of nature and indigenous societies. But one of the main themes is the meaninglessness of modern, technological society. Scenes of baby chicks being sped along are juxtaposed with scenes of commuters rushing to and fro. Yes, we know the modern world is often inhuman.

3510231,5,B001CDLAT4,"Whilst cinema is an art form, Baraka is a piece of art.

It is like no other film you will ever see.

The film is an extraordinary collection of sounds and images from across the globe. There is no dialogue or explanation of what we are seeing. The images are left to tell their own story and take you on their journey.

There is no pretence to what we see:  the viewer is invited to find beauty in dancing African tribesman one minute, then and busy pedestrian crossings in Tokyo the next, before being confronted by the harsh reality of peoples who must search through discarded waste to make a living.

Everyone will find their own meaning in the beautiful sequences, and part of the Movie's charm is this presentation of beauty and natural rhythms, rather than the documentary-style where directors hold the viewers' hands throughout the movie and tell them what to think.

Some will chose to be mesmerized by the beauty alone, whilst other will feel compelled by the movie's gradual move from Nature's beauty to the devastation caused by Human existence. Marvelously, Baraka does not require you to do either, challenging the viewer but empowering them to make what they will of the experience.

Baraka requires your full attention.

It requires total immersion.

Do so, and you will be taken on one of the most moving cinematic experiences ever.

Still underrated in terms of its significance, the film was originally released  in 1992. Director Ron Fricke (who made was the cinematographer for what was essentially the film's predecessor, Koyaanisqatsi  pushed the boundaries of cinematography and designed cameras especially for this movie to capture nature at its most stunning and profound moments.

The remastered Blu Ray has been painstakingly restored frame by frame, and now allows us to be properly awed by the original footage in our lounge rooms. Blu Ray and Special Editions include interesting discussions about how the film was reformatted to bring new life to the original print-an extraordinary and painstaking process that has given a magical result.

(As a side note, a high quality audiovisual viewing setup is also required if you are to truly experience the power of this movie).

To be gob smacked by such raw beauty and confronted by such compelling images is rare. Make time for Baraka, and you will understand what it is to be truly awed by the power of cinema.",1316822400,,2392,4.900744416873449

3510236,5,B001CDLAT4,"I discovered my soft spot for Visual Arts film when I first watched KOYANNISQATSI, where quite literally a picture said more than a thousand words. Followed by POWAQATSI and Ron Fricke's own CHRONOS (in a manner of speaking a sequel to KOYANNISQATSI focusing on European locations and at the same time the prequel to BARAKA, revealing Ron Fricke's personal artistic style to approach the subject), BARAKA is - put simply - the mother of all such Visual Arts films.

Without any audible word Ron Fricke confronts the audience with images of our world and scenes from global life, sometimes beautiful and exciting, sometimes ugly and sobering but always in a context that invites self-reflection and involves the audience (in many memorable instances it is somewhat unclear whether it's the audience that's watching or the one being watched). What never ceases to amaze me are the reactions of my guests I expose to BARAKA, some are taken in silent awe, others are giggling and reveal a kind of uncertainty as to what to think about the experience.

Words can't express my gratitude to all the individuals involved in the restoration process of this Blu-ray disc, there is an impressive remove-the-veil-visualization that illustrates what BARAKA looked like on home video first and now (which itself is worth to watch), and the documentary about the making of the film is rich in anecdotes (I couldn't help but feel that the production itself was truly blessed as Murphy's Law seemed to be banned by a higher force for the duration of production).

Just a few words about some issues I've repeatedly heard: BARAKA was shot on film and with special lenses, so in close-up camera shots the background is sometimes out of focus which is owed to technical reasons and artistic intentions (there is nothing wrong with the HD resolution). Sometimes audiences would have liked a subtitle option indicating at which global location the shot was taken, because at times BARAKA has a somewhat inevitable Trivial Pursuit character (but a travelogue wasn't Ron Fricke's artistic intention. The end credits reveal all the locations).
The making of the film documentary clearly reveals that much more footage that's not included in the film was shot. Personally, I'd like to see that one day but feel it shouldn't be used to make a ""special edition"" of BARAKA, as I couldn't possibly imagine how it could ever improve the film in its finished version.

If you feel the bulk of movies Hollywood produces is like eating cake all the time and you look for something with more nutrition and a different, exotic flavor, BARAKA is my ultimate recommendation. It is definitely a film everyone should watch in his or her lifetime, as it constitutes a one-of-a-kind experience, unlike all others.",1308960000,,2771,4.991341991341991

Anyone who has a home theater system owes it to themselves (and their system!) to spin this flick at least once (and in my case repeatedly).

These are the kinds of films that Blu-Ray High Definition was meant for.  We want to see every small detail of all the beauty as well as all the not so pleasant visuals of our strange world.

On a big screen TV, this Blu-Ray film will definitely take you away from your natural comfort zone environment and put you right there on the other side of the world.

What is the bloody point?

Taken at face value, this random compilation of scenes from all over the world is beautiful, but ultimately a pointless waste of time. The film makers are wasting excellent footage in spreading their childish, simplified message: Modern way of living is bad - ancient beliefs and nonsensical behaviour is good. A most dubious message, especially when delivered by people who utilise all sorts of modern technological gadgets in creating their movie (advanced cameras, computers, scanners, helicopters, jet planes, etc.)

Bending over backwards for (in this case Eastern) religious nonsense is not a helpful act for the future of this planet. It only makes you more ignorant of the problems and their possible solutions.

Why didn't the team behind this mess try to tell some of the stories that are hidden below the eye candy? There are so many interesting angles, so many conflicting views and interests to illuminate:
- Why were the temples of Cambodia abandoned for hundreds of years?
- Why is the rain forest being felled in South America, and how can this be countered?
- How our early civilisations relied on the timber industry to the extend, that most of the forest in western countries were felled?
- Why some people in India (the untouchables) are forced to live on (and off) the rubbish dumps? (It is not a technological problem but a religious/social problem).
- How religious observance make old ladies rinse their dentures in the very same water that other people wash in, urinate in and discard charred body parts in; and why this is a problem for hygiene.
- What constitutes a humane treatment of animals?
- Etc., etc.

May I recommend, as a substitute, the quite similar but much more persuasive movie ""Home"" by Yann Arthus-Bertrand.

Boy oh boy, I was hoping that this blu-ray would do justice to the phenomenal depth and intensity of cinematographer/director Ron Fricke's Baraka, and rarely have I ever been less disappointed!

This film, already stunning in its wordless narrative of so many cultures and natural wonders on our incredible planet, comes to life like no other in blu-ray. As explained in one of the extras, this is the highest-quality transfer ever made to BD or dvd. Yes, you read that right. It's an 8k scan of a 70mm print, both the highest level of their respective digital and analog technologies, and this BD is in fact even crisper than the original theatrical print, having been cleaned up in parts from the print's occasional flaws. I've never seen a better picture on a home video screen.

There are few words to express how good this film looks, and few films ever made deserve this kind of perfectionist treatment. If one film can be said to more movingly cover this many views of mankind and our impact on this planet, I sure haven't seen it. Fricke takes his awe-inspring work on Koyanisqaatsi and the other Qaatsi films and moves them to the next level here. There are no simple answers or even questions, just images of Earth and its denizens, biped and so much more; funny thing is, we're the only species destroying the planet. That's made all too clear here, and the lack of words brings it home more forcefully, especially when juxtaposed with superb images of the immense peace and harmony present when mankind is not. The stunning colors and amazing depth of the images are done full justice by this frighteningly fine transfer; prepare yourself appropriately, turn out all the lights, and lose your mind in this one-of-a-kind visual experience, made even more intense by Michael Stearn's majestic score.

If you have a hi-def tv and a blu-ray player, run don't walk to get this BD disc. It will redefine what your system can do, while reminding you that it's just a screen and that the real wonders lie outside, in reality, on a planet whose dominant species is quickly eradicating many of the greatest treasures to which it was heir, as we're mutely shown. This film might even inspire you to do what you can to help preserve some of the myriad jewels to which this work of art bears witness.

This is the same review I'm combining for the comparison of both Chronos and Baraka.

CHRONOS & BARAKA
These programs are visual displays of majestic landmarks, people, cultures, and wonders of the world.  If you want to watch TV, but don't feel like watching TV, these are the way to go.  No thinking, no storyline, just relax and let your imagination go.  It's a revolutionary new age type of artistic display.  It can be watched repeatedly without boredom, like a music CD.

BARAKA
As far as the content of Baraka, the major problem I have are those bizarre African tribe ritual scenes.  Not that there's anything wrong with this, but I'd much rather see this in a documentary, with a narrator describing this cultural meaning.  Ie, teach me. OK, I see the point of Baraka is appreciation of art, but without the explanation, these weird clips leave me in a state of mysterious void of confusion. Perhaps Baraka should have a 2nd audio channel or subtitle. Same goes with the shots of homeless people and inner city trash: BORING, and disgusting.  Homeless and trash on 1080p is not art.

CHRONOS
Chronos is Baraka minus the weird tribal rituals.  Chronos is 100% sheer art in its original Ron Flicke form. Every scene, second, and breath has power, deep thoughts and emotions attached to it, can be watch numerously, anytime.  Chronos blu ray also includes 3 invaluable features not on Baraka.  1) Global location pop up, 2) Annotations pop up of detailed features of each location, and 3) Director's audio commentary.

I give Chronos blu ray 5 star, and Baraka blu ray 3 stars.",1271548800,,1672,4.737024221453288
3510271,3,B001CDLAT4,"Overall I liked it.  It started off really great, but then the time-lapse footage in the middle was kind of dull and just dragged on forever.",1271116800,,141,4.423076923076923
3510272,5,B001CDLAT4,"All I can say is this is like a video equivalent to a great Pink Floyd album... quality is crazy, both video and audio are amazing.",1270944000,,131,4.076923076923077
3510283,5,B001CDLAT4,"Because the filmmakers were real perfectionist, technically i can say that this is the highest quality Blu Ray in the market.",1270684800,,125,5.0
3510284,5,B001CDLAT4,"I had never heard of this documentary until I stumbled upon it on CNET's top 40 must own blu ray discs. I moved it straight to the top of my Netflix queue to see what they were raving about. When Baraka starts, it puts you near the top of the Himalaya Mountains and I thought, ""Oh this is nice, like Planet Earth with no words, I wonder how long this is..."". Then it depicts a baboon in a hot spring...WOW! The video quality in this scene is PHENOMENAL! I literally felt 'there' and wanted to dip my feet in the hot spring. From there, 'Baraka' takes you on a journey across the globe, visiting hidden cultures and places, along with some well known places such as Hong Kong and NYC. Clearly it wanted to show the extremes between modern and undeveloped cultures. I loved the photography in this film; every view has a purpose and tells a story. The transfer to blu ray is fantastic! With sharp details, accurate colors, and a great sense of depth and scope, the video is easily one of the best I've seen on blu ray. The audio ranks right up there with the video. The musical score of the film further extends the photography beyond the screen. Depth and clarity of the audio gives it the purest sounding audio track I've ever heard. I got lost in this film within the first few minutes, and I only found my way back when the credits rolled. I would recommend 'Baraka' to everyone. Documentary, audio, and video enthusiasts will especially enjoy this film.",1270166400,,1456,4.456928838951311
3510285,5,B001CDLAT4,"If you are looking for a Blu-Ray disk to show off your HD video set-up, look no further.  I own over 30 Blu-rays now and have rented almost 70 more over the past 2 1/2 years.  Only a few (The Golden Compass, The Fifth Element and Casino Royale) come anywhere near the video quality of this disk (if I could quantify, I'd say perhaps 80%).  Watch the 'making of' featurette and you'll see why.  Every frame was scanned at 4k resolution (around 32 megapixels each) and cleaned up over the course of several months.  The result is a picture that is truly remarkable.  The audio quality is fantastic but pales a tad in comparrison to the stunning picture.  Although the content itself can be a (oh i don't know...'non-life reaffirming', such as the monotinous factory work scenes) I would highly reccommend this documentary.  There are a few very 'interesting' religious rituals that I had never knew existed (and probably most people didn't until this was made) that were fascinating to watch.  I pop this in on rainy days and just let the eye-candy effect take over.",1270166400,,1064,4.67741935483871
3510286,5,B001CDLAT4,"To be brief, imagine living inside an issue of National Geographic. There is no narrative, nor does need it. In fact I would say narration would be a detriment. The visuals are amazing, unquestionably the most visually stunning film I've ever seen. That being said, I wouldn't recommend Baraka unless you have a decent High Def TV and surround sound system.",1268870400,,357,4.868852459016393
3510287,5,B001CDLAT4,"I believe the world is more beautiful than not, and this beautiful gem of a film expresses that sentiment.  When you stay overnight at my house for the first time, without any fanfare, you will find this film playing in the morning.  I time it with the coffee, tea and juice being ready.  You sit, sip, and voila!  I see it as a gift I am bestowing upon those I care about, along with bagels and eggs.  I have only shown it in the beginning of a day, due to it's many eye-opening qualities.",1268524800,,490,4.170212765957447
3510288,4,B001CDLAT4,"One of the first things I realized was that this film was virtually non verbal. By having this silence in the movie, there was a dramatic focus on what I saw more than what someone in the movie told me what I was seeing. It portrayed the global perspective of life in such a way that it felt as if you were truly there experiencing nature and the way many people coexist. It was amazing how it captured natural regions in the world that appeared timeless, as though you were in a different era of time. Tranquility was the first word that came to mind as the film went on to show the humanity in different cultures with their beliefs and practices, how they lived and for some, how they lived on in death. The film revealed the diversity of people, but also depicted an invisible interconnectedness, a global commonness about the inhabitants of the world and for our instinct to live.  As the film progressed, it went on to depict the industrialization of land and development of cities on a global scale, from farming to manufacturing, how it was affecting our natural resources. It revealed how overly populated Earth truly is; we look like tiny insignificant ants following suit to keep our respective lives going. At this point there was a different perception of people. The film captured how many more people are out there stressed and struggling to provide food and shelter, caring for their families, and working mundanely in an almost hypnotic, robotic way, as they went on about what they were doing. There were also many people self-absorbed in what they were doing and how they were living their own lives, it was as if that interconnectedness didn't exist on a conscious level (because it does exist as we are all living beings on Earth), but rather people ignored one another. Everything I saw invoked a deep feeling of appreciation.",1268006400,,1847,4.700617283950617
3510289,5,B001CDLAT4,"Want to know what your A/V equipment can do, especially on the image side?
This is the disc to show you, you will be dazzled by the video quality.
Not a typical 'movie' or 'documentary', a story told with haunting sights and sounds.
Every boutique A/V shop needs to have this and use it generously to get the point across.",1266364800,,322,4.383333333333334
3510290,5,B001CDLAT4,"""Baraka""(1992) is filmed and directed by Ron Fricke, who also was the cinematographer of Koyannisqatsi (1982). This non-narrative film that explores the human condition was shot in 70mm in 24 countries on six continents, and has, with this blu-ray edition, been restored with a 8K HD Scan, the first and only film to receive this ultra-high definition treatment. Its sequel ""Samsara"" is planned for release in 2010. This disc also includes a restoration documentary, and an almost one hour feature about the making of the film. The score is by Michael Stearns and features music by Dead Can Dance and others. This is a film to have if one wants to see what blu-ray is capable of.",1266364800,,679,4.811965811965812
3510291,2,B001CDLAT4,"A friend of ours asked us to watch this with them over the weekend. Three months ago, another friend had had us watch Koyaanisqatsi with them. Make no mistake, they are definitely different versions on the same theme. We loved the Philip Glass music score to Koyaanisqatsi, but man, that movie is an hour longer than it should be. It was exhausting to watch the constantly repeated images and repeated takes of rolling clouds, traffic and assembly lines. My husband and I were rather shocked to see the exact same scenes replayed in Baraka. I kept wondering why there hadn't been a copyright infringement lawsuit, until I read that the same person  had worked on both films.

What we enjoyed about Bakara was the superior filming technology, as well as the variety of architecture and cultures portrayed in this version. I was particularly struck with the beautiful religious buildings, and the cultural practices such as the chanting and most notably the cremation scenes from India.

What was particularly annoying were all the scenes that were pretty much image for image taken from Koyaanisqatsi. The rolling clouds, the long segments showing people staring at the camera, the assembly line scenes, the scenes of the streets with the traffic filmed in time-lapse. My husband and I couln't believe how similar the two films were. I am sure that it wouln't have taken such a negative twist if we hadn't seen Koyaanisquatsi first, but alas we did. But yes, they are pretty much the same, there is still the clear message of a disintegration of humanity, and loss of spiritualism. I agree that the message is important. I think we just felt cheated by the fact that they are marketing this as something completely new, and it is clearly not.",1266278400,,1741,4.8552188552188555

3510303,5,B001CDLAT4,"What else can I say that others haven't covered? I saw this years ago on a standard 21"" tube years ago and loved it then... now watching it on a 50"" plasma I was just blown away by this film. If this movie doesn't make you wonder about our world and get you thinking and feeling that it's time for some change then I don't know what will. This is the only Blu-ray disc I have found worth owning thus far; I just rent everything else.",1265932800,,433,4.046511627906977
3510304,5,B001CDLAT4,"This is a really interesting movie with breathtaking cinematography. The tagline of the movie is ""A World Beyond Words"" and it consists of footage of landscapes, religious rituals and daily life from all over the world set to ethnic music. There is no dialogue at all. Baraka is difficult to describe, but will definitely move you.",1265414400,,331,4.928571428571429
3510305,4,B001CDLAT4,Incredible cinematography.  The best Blu-ray movie that I have seen in terms of showing off HD in true 1080p.,1264896000,,109,4.7368421052631575
3510306,5,B001CDLAT4,"1st, Stunning Image Quality. The video transfer into HiDef is flawless. Clean, Clear, and Crisp. This BD will show you how good Blue Ray can be, and what other HD movies should be in term of Image Quality. It is a Hi Definition with Hi Fidelity I think, even the 1080P resolution is not enough to show the real hi resolution of the movie. This is my BD reference.

2nd, the storyline is about ""The Avatar of real life"". Simply so beautiful, no words to tell, the pictures tell millions words. It will touch your consciousness, if you were still awake while watching it ;-)",1264377600,,572,4.447619047619048

3510308,5,B001CDLAT4,"Spectacular.  There's no other word for it.  There's not very many titles I'm going to re-purchase on Blu Ray; however, this is one, and it is well worth it.  The transfer is stunning.  I can't believe how awful the dvd version looks to me now.",1263254400,,244,4.355555555555555
3510309,5,B001CDLAT4,"I saw this on the big screen & remember being stunned & shocked at the visual juxtaposition from the Himalayas to the slums of the Andes to the ant colony movements of Manhattan.
The blu-ray edition sets the standard to be achieved for HD remastering but I suppose it isn't always realistic to expect this of most movies, given it was shot in 70mm.",1263168000,,348,4.453125
3510310,5,B001CDLAT4,"First, I'd like to mention the picture quality. This is, by far, the highest quality film I have ever seen on blu ray. It's truly breathtaking, from the first scenes of mountains to the very end.

As for the film itself, it's a wonderful (and admittedly 80's looking at times) dive into different cultures around the world. They don't tell you where each scene is, but I like the mystery of trying to figure it out myself. And of course, there's the internet if you're curious.

Some might thing it's a bit boring, but I wouldn't call it a movie so much as an experience. Just take in the fantastic visuals and different world music and enjoy it.",1263168000,,646,4.466101694915254
3510311,5,B001CDLAT4,"amazing, the best image resolution ever..i buy the dvd disc, but this blu ray edition is the glorious image definition ever!---

3510312,5,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka is an absolute wonder to watch, especially in HD format where the picture and sound is as pristine and clear as if you were there experiencing live.  Michael Sterns soundtrack is an audio treat in itself and lends support beautifully and in one instance heartbreakingly to Baraka's touching theme.  One only has to begin watching the intro to know that what they are about to see is a powerful commentary narrated by music.  The majesty, pagentry and human elements all combine to compliment each other in no way any other documentary can.  An absolute must.",1261267200,,565,4.854166666666667
3510323,5,B001CDLAT4,"I need a disc to test my home theater.  I purchased this Blu-ray disc because of its reputation of being the first 8K digital transfer from 65mm film.  The picture quality is stunning.  The music sounds great too, but there is not much audio special effects to test my sound system.  Chronos was made by the same director.  I've purchased that too, but Chronos is inferior compared to this.

The contents are amazing too.  Great imagery from around the world.  Some parts may scare young children.  e.g. the stacks of human skulls in Cambodia and the open air cremation and a close up shot of a partially cremated human remain may bring nightmare to young kids.",1260921600,,661,4.629310344827586
3510324,5,B001CDLAT4,"The critical Amazon reviews of this have been thoroughly fascinating and illustrative of the range of intellect in our online consumer culture. This variation spans psychology and intellect, from a large group of viewers who felt the filmmaker was pushing a message about the evils of modern society to those that found his message too shallow and merely voyeuristic. Some were lost without the structure of narration or plot line. Amazon has included many reviews critical of the transfer and encoding, which were for the original, out-of-print, poorly-transferred DVD version under the listing for the Blu-Ray version, which is truly stunning.  There is a negative review by a technology freak who has built himself a home theater and refined his technical knowledge beyond being able to enjoy a thing of beauty.

To these people I say: try turning off you're your feelings of inadequacy and stop projecting your own fears and discomfort onto the joy of experience and wonder. Although not beyond criticism, this disc offers you an uncommon opportunity to peer into a window of experience unlike any other. Several of the Reggio films were great, and Frick has continued along that path with his own, alternate vision, refining and expanding the theme of using visual transport to a spiritual realm; looking at our world in a way that transcends time and mere cultural associations. Try looking at these images as wonders of the world from the eyes of a child, where even the most base modern practice is revealed as a thing of beauty through the lens of this amazing custom-made camera. Yes, there is juxtaposition here between the sublime and the banal, pointing a direction as well as contrasting a level of spiritual action which has come to us from our ancestors, no matter who we are. It is the filmmaker's opinion, as any film is.

Besides being beautiful, this disc is technically the best quality photographic reproduction I have seen in the Blu-Ray medium. nothing I have seen even comes close.",1260403200,,2006,4.982089552238806
3510325,5,B001CDLAT4,Recommended by CNET as one of the top choices for blu-ray. It doesn't disappoint. Filmed in the highest resolution available. It's more like a visual meditation than a coherent film. It takes you on a sort of spiritual earthly journey without any dialogue.,1257897600,,256,4.976744186046512
3510326,5,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka is for those of us who like to travel, see and experience different cultures and dream about the next trip and aspire to take great photos.  Baraka is an amazing journey for the eyes and the ears; the scenery, people and music is almost meditative.  Beautifully done.",1257724800,,274,4.6875
3510327,5,B001CDLAT4,"This Blu-ray version is simply outstanding, incredible, breathtaking and mesmerizing. I rarely recommend people buy a film but this one is truly worth every penny. If it were $50 or more I'd buy it. You can find many stories if you like in this film or none at all. I know it sounds shallow to simply watch it for the eye/ear candy but you can do that and walk away very satisfied. The cinematography, the editing, the music, the scenery, the flow is all beyond words. This is the way this film was meant to be. I bought the first DVD version years ago and it was a sheer piece of junk. I hesitated before purchasing this because some people had praised the first DVD and it was awful. This is the way the film was meant to be shown. The care and the quality that went into the scanning can be seen from the very first frame. So many older documentaries have been converted to Blu-ray and look horrible once you've seen the BBC's Planet Earth (many older films were not even properly cleaned so you see many artifacts like cracks, dust etc). Not in this version (ok, if you look very closely I think I found a few small dust artifacts in a couple of frames but barely noticeable).

Look, stop reading. Buy it and forget about it no matter the cost. This is the film I always imagined it should be. It is truly amazing that this film was shot in 1992. It looks like a modern BBC Hi-def production. Actually it's of an even better quality. You can tell that the people who did the re-mastering spent a great deal of time and effort to make this a reality. If I could give it 6 stars, this film would get it.",1257638400,,1605,4.262295081967213
3510328,4,B001CDLAT4,"Yes, yes, this is a beautiful and stunning film. But read on.

First, there is a theme of unsettling footage of people staring directly into the camera. It's unsettling because they just stare without emotion, for probably at least 10 seconds at a time (which is a long time to stare at someone staring back at you). It's unsettling, but extremely interesting. I think this is a good part of the film. This is something you don't generally see in everyday life.

However, be warned, or maybe that's too strong a term, but you should be aware that there are a few parts that are disturbing. I would say these parts are political, except that without any commentary it is the viewer who is left to draw their own conclusions, rather than any conclusions being posited. For instance, there is a rather lengthy part showing chickens in a production farm that is somewhat disturbing. The handling of chicks is shown, with them sliding down chutes as if they were pills being sorted into jars. In fact they are being sorted, but into which two groups? The ambiguity is disturbing. Then a worker is burning or cutting the beaks of the chicks and roughly tossing htem aside. And then a worker holds chicks down in a contraption that does something to their necks. All this bothersome imagery comes in the middle of an otherwise beautiful series of vignettes. I thought it kind of ruined the mood of wonder and enjoyment.

More bothersome imagery is shown at the end, when fields of burning oil wells are shown, smoke filling the sky, and a scene of soldiers with stacks of ordnance around them. Again, I thought this emotionally violent footage ruined the beauty of the film.

I do think the film is compelling enough to overcome these negative parts however. One of the interesting habits of the film is how it draws a comparison between various unrelated scenes. For instance, it shows a tribal society performing a lively dance and then cuts to images of a busy subway, drawing a parallel between the pace of life of different cultures. There is also a lot of parallels drawn between different ancient ruins. The film segues fluidly (for the most part) between one scene to the next.

Check it out and fast forward through the negative bits.",1257033600,,2236,4.6938775510204085
3510329,5,B001CDLAT4,"I bought this few weeks ago to play it on my Sony PS3 Blu-ray system. The picture quality is amazing. Anyone who wants to have a true HD content with documentary of human and colorful places around earth. This is a must to have.

3510331,5,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka is a breathtaking global tour through 24 countries. This un-narrated film has no main story or plot. Instead, it uses dramatic cinematography to present a series of themes centered around the spirituality of man and nature. The movie is a montage of beautifully photographed scenes, played to a stirring soundtrack of ambient environmental sounds. I can only describe Baraka as visual poetry!

The 8k high-def scan from the original 70mm film is absolutely incredible, well worth the time-consuming process. If you own a high-end 1080p display, this blu-ray DVD is an absolute must-have.",1254268800,,594,5.319148936170213
3510332,3,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka's visuals are absolutely stunning.  They evoke an emotional connection with human cultural and spiritual practices similar to what Planet Earth does with nature.  The image quality of the high-resolution transfer is also nearly pristine.  This is my reference image quality disc for BD playback.  That said, unfortunately, there's I don't find a lot of repeat watching of the full disc based on its content.  While the imagery is beautiful and I'll always have this disc on hand for demos, the lack of narration makes this a one time watch for me... it's a great one time watch, but if you don't plan on using it for home-theater demos, I'd call this a rental for most folks.",1254096000,,682,4.794871794871795
3510343,5,B001CDLAT4,"This film is uniquely beautiful, especially in high definition.  Its hard to describe it justly, but its almost a visual meditation - no narration or dialog, just a stream of consciousness showing scenes of nature and of mankind, both striking and beautiful.

3510350,5,B001CDLAT4,"I recently got a 50"" plasma (panasonic G10) and a blu-ray player (panasonic 60) and I wanted to test out all the blu-rays that supposedly had the best picture quality. These nature docs have been considered some of the best.

GALAPAGOS = 4-Star Blu-Ray Video / 2-Star Nature Doc

The video is good, but not great like a pristine movie transfer like Sin City or Kung-Fu Panda. I found this nature doc particularly boring. It has a few nice bits, but there's lots of repetition of shots, and wildlife just isn't as interesting as the other docs. I would only reccomend this if you're super super super interesting in learning about Galapagos.

GANGES = 4-Star Blu-ray Video / 3-Star Nature Doc

Video quality is about the same as Galapagos, good, but there's a lot better. This nature doc is a lot more interesting than Galapagos, more magic shots, better tid bits, a more emotional experience. This is worth checking out for the content.

PLANET EARTH = 4.5-Star Blu-ray Video / 4-Star Nature Doc

This is a fantastic video transfer, better than Galapagos and Ganges. By better, I mean, richer blacks, deeper colors, sharper detail. All around, a step up. This is a four disc experience. I think they put all their best content on the first disc. Seriously, the first disc was thrilling, the others were a huge step down, in terms of locations and wildlife. Maybe it's a weird personal preference thing, but I watched the first disc three times, but could barely get through the others. I would say disc one is a must see.

BARAKA = 5-Star Blu-ray Video / 5-Star Nature Doc

This wins the Super Shiny Titanium Standard Award for best video and best nature doc. It was shot on 70mm and transfered to, like, quad-HD digital. This is one of the very best blu-rays ever made. It holds up against all new releases, because the source was 70mm. And this nature doc seemed the most magical. If you want to get a good demo disc, to show to any audience, this is the one. And the Baraka experience sticks with you. I can see myself watching this quite a few times in the years ahead, just for the experience.",1250208000,,2098,4.576

Thanks to Blu Ray technology, the film is extended ten fold in clarity, rawness and depth. I viewed the film on my ps3 console through my 32"" HD television at 1080i resolution and it was crystal clear. My next task is to view it on a much larger screen! Be careful however if you are  buying the region 'A' version and you live in Europe... it won't play. It must be a region 'B' copy. All in all, this film goes beyond cinematography, its has become an art form in its own right.",1247443200,,628,4.147540983606557
3510364,5,B001CDLAT4,"Ron Fricke was the cinematographer on ""Koyanniqatsi,"" a ground-breaking non-narrative documentary. ""Baraka"" follows the general idea, being a film that eschews narration or story but bombards the viewer with thought-provoking visuals and sounds from our world. Technically, this Blu-ray disc is one of the finest I've seen. The 2.20:1 image is overflowing with fine detail and breathtaking colour. The  dts HD Master Audio soundtrack is equally impressive.

The only note of cautions I would give is to be careful with fingerprints and smudges on the disc.  I had some skipping about 3/4 through and noticed some fingerprints on it (probably from a friend handling it).  I wiped them off and played like a pro.",1246665600,,522,4.118811881188119

3510367,4,B001CDLAT4,"First, I want to note that this disc didn't work in my Sony Bluray player.  I was deeply disappointed, but I didn't want to give it up, so I set it aside in the hopes of getting it to work someday.  I eventually figured out that I could connect the player to the internet and update its firmware, and that got Baraka working.  If your player has trouble with this disc, see if any firmware update is available!

As for the movie. . .  I see that people who buy it often get 2001: A Space Odyssey too.  Good call!  With Baraka's stunning cinematography and lack of any dialog or narration, I was reminded of 2001, especially the opening ""dawn of man"" sequences.  Maybe this film should have been called 1993: An Earth Odyssey.

Most of the images are beautiful, some are stunning, many are thought-provoking, and the soundtrack is an excellent match for it all.  I shouldn't have to repeat the praise that many have already heaped on Baraka -- it's all true.  However, I also have to quibble with Baraka, because it has philosophical axe to grind.  The unsubtle theme is that industry destroys the Earth, modern life is dehumanizing, and we'd all be better off returning to the forest and becoming oh-so-wise-and-happy stone age hunter-gatherers.

In fact, one of the best ways to describe Baraka is by telling what it isn't.  If any of you have seen the TV series ""Modern Marvels"", just imagine the polar opposite of that.  MM is homely, Baraka is beautiful.  MM is prosaic, Baraka is sublime.  MM explains, Baraka shows.  MM thinks, Baraka feels.  And then there's the underlying message. . .  Modern Marvels is a paean to technology, industry and progress.  Baraka is a condemnation of those things.  My own philosophy, I have to say, is more in line with Modern Marvels.

In short:  I adored Baraka, but I also have to take it with a grain of salt.  I suggest you do the same.",1245888000,,1879,4.553892215568863

This is by far and away the best looking High Definition (Blu-Ray or HD-DVD) disc I have looked at--period!  The whole time it was on I couldn't help but be ""distracted"" by how clear and beautiful the images were.

3510383,2,B001CDLAT4,"Well, no, maybe there was a theme: we stink.

We are wasteful (hundreds of military aircraft sitting in the Arizona desert), brutal (Cambodia's killing fields, Auschwitz), ephemeral (Egyptian ruins), vain (Amazon and African tribes in the most colorful dress), exploitive (numbing assembly lines, cigarette factories, prostitution), and oblivious to suffering (chicken processing plants, scavenging in trash heaps).

We're also religious (countless scenes). Was that the director's message? That for all our faith and devotion, we're despicable?

And that nature is magnificent? Waterfalls, volcanoes, springbok enjoying the first rains, pensive monkeys soaking in hot springs?

I love the beauty of nature, too, but crowded cities also give us schools, orchestras, and hospitals. Not to mention employment, safe drinking water, and a diversity of thought not possible in nature.

The photographer's skill and effort is obvious. I wish he'd had a director with a vision of what to photograph.

Finally, the comparison to Koyaanisqatsi is not in this film's favor.

------------

5 October 2014, I watch ""Samsara"" and am overwhelmed with its brilliance. Many of the images would not leave me that night.

Am I wrong wondering why we were given Israeli checkpoints and the border wall but not the reason for it, the victims of bus, restaurant and school bombings, their bodies shredded with the most pain-inflicting shrapnel possible?

A week later, I see ""Chronos"" and decide that Mr Fricke is captivated by The Image -- and few others can present images as well -- but is muddleheaded about their meanings. Like an idiot-savant child who plays beautiful piano, he gives us pretty pictures with no idea of their meaning or history.

I'm also put off by his too-frequent use of the same types of images -- time-lapse photography of big-city traffic; scavenging in garbage dumps; southwest American vistas; for example -- in all or most of his films.

I would ask Mr Fricke to drop natural scenes altogether -- leave them to BBC, which does them quite well -- and give us only what man has touched. For better or worse, we are more amazing, both more beautiful and more ugly, than anything in nature.",1239235200,,2197,5.157746478873239

I was a huge fan of Planet Earth, but this movie with no Narration is top notch!  The BD is a real treat with stunning visuals, and incredible sound (watch the special features, the sound guy did some pretty amazing stuff!)

3510398,5,B001CDLAT4,"There are already plenty of detailed reviews here about the film itself---I've been a huge fan since seeing the theatrical release, and consider it probably my all-time favorite film ever.
However, I'd been holding out on buying a BluRay player.  That is, until I saw that the BluRay version of Baraka was available; that was enough to get me to buy a player and the disc (making it the third copy I've owned, from VHS, to DVD, to BluRay.)
The quality of the BluRay version is simply astonishing.  How much of that has to do with BluRay's technology, and how much is the 8K scan used to transfer from the original film, I'm not sure.  (The documentary of the BluRay transfer & restoration process is fascinating and impressive.  I would agree with the comment expressed there, that this represents the finest transfer of film to digital, ever.)  It is simply a revelation seeing the BluRay version.  Picture and sound are brilliant, details crisp and visible once more, like in the theater.  (Even the menu to navigate through the chapters is a wonderful improvement over the DVD version!)
I will point out here that my first BluRay disc of Baraka seemed to be a bad copy---it locked up in the player at 1:12:10.  I could play everything before that point, and from the next chapter to the end of the film, plus the bonus material... but not right at the 1hr-12min mark.  I saw no obvious damage on the disc, and returned it for an exchange; the second disc worked just fine.
I highly recommend this BluRay version to every fan of Baraka, and of course, the film itself is something I think everyone should see at least twice...!

They simply sat, staring at the screen - then composed themselves and eventually filed out of the room. That's the strongest testimonial I can give you!

Baraka is powerful... no dialogue. It's a visual documentary of a poetic tour of the globe set to the rhythms of various religious and spiritual rituals, spanning diverse locales as China, Brazil, Kuwait and major US and European sites. The soundtrack will lubricate your mind. If you are an artist, you will want to own this DVD!

Although any scene from this movie could be an award winning cover on any magazine ever (yes ever), the fact that there was no narration, no dialogue and obviously no flow, could not be ignored.  The only thought that this movie provoked in me over and over again was ""what specific type of hallucinogen was it that was the key component to making this film?""

With that being said, I had seen things in this movie that were truly amazing, however without any intellectual support I have no reference in studying any of the wonderful things further that I had witnessed during this film.  For this reason I was very disappointed.  This forced me to rate this movie with only 2 stars, which was a bit painful since there was some amazing footage shown.

3510431,5,B001CDLAT4,"PQ 5/5, Sound 4/5. The film was watched on a 42"" Panasonic Plasma, and BD30K Blu-Ray player.

The film presents a worldly journey and without having read the film makers mission, an inevitable interconnectedness between cultures, socio-econimic statuses, and societal position was apparent throughout. Due to the powerful sound track, I felt as though I had been meditating for an hour and a half. Some of the images were beautiful,some were sad, and most were inexplicably stirring. This is a film that showcases humanity, for its unversality, and its relevance for the past and future centuries to come. The scenes are shown without reference to location, which increase wonder and speculation and really lends power to the images.

The Making of Featurette was very interesting from a film making perspective, and there was some discussion about the locations and challenges faced in completing the film.

If you are a hi-def enthusiast and enjoy documentaries and sturring cinema, this is one not to be missed. Roger Ebert was certainly correct in his assessment of naming this one the reason why Blu-Ray was brough to market.

3510433,2,B001CDLAT4,"No, it was not, what I expected. I am familiar with the theatrical 70 mm release print, I had a chance to watch the Sony Corporation 4 k scan on their flagship SRX projector, which looked absolutely gorgeous.
But to say, this disk sucks. An 8 k scan, softened, and then resharpened to make the HDCAM 1080p format look nice on a flat screen TV? No, this is not, what I call a reference disk. Any Iron Man, any Madagascar, any Pixar or simply any modern motion picture created in 2k digital workflow looks better, than this.
And, they totally blew the soundtrack!
Originally released in Masgnetic 70 mm Noise reduction 2 format, this film was always a problem case for Dolby equipped theatres, specificly, if they were THX certified. There was so much infrasonic on the track, which always overmodulated the playback chain.
With the disk, they took it over the top. They equalized for home (small() speakers, with a system, which has high pass filtering (lo cut to protect) built in, added some pseudo bass, and then did not filter off the subsonics. Result: My 1900 W ch sub amps into clipping 40"" of brick walls shaking. No, this disk: Stay away. Do not buy.
If you're looking for really nice reference materials: Buy a recent Pixar / Disney blue ray. They do show how nice projected home theatre can be.
I have to admit: I do not use a standard home set. My picture is 24 ft wide, projected thru a recent 2k projector. The sound system matches that, of the best theatres, so there is more to hear, than at home. But if something is rated as reference, it must actually withstand the reference playback test.",1229731200,,1608,4.548275862068966

3510440,5,B001CDLAT4,"I just finished watching Baraka tonight and put in Discovery Atlas China randomly, for a change of moods. Wow! What a difference! Baraka puts Discovery China to shame, which made me wonder if I was even watching an HD presentation. Baraka's colors were vibrant and crisp. Discovery China was lifeless and dull by comparison, with noticeable interlacing. If I had put in another Blu-ray, the difference might not have been so stark, and here are the reasons why:

Baraka was lovingly remastered and restored using a very expensive and time-consuming 8K scanning process, which is advertised on the box and explained on the disc in a short video. This BD transfer was remastered from the original 70mm negatives at the highest possible resolution available today in a special film scanner at FotoKem, supposedly the only one of its kind in existence. Scanning the film into the machine alone took 3 continuous weeks, even before restoration could begin.

Oversampled at 8192 pixels per row (that's where the ""8K"" in the 8K Ultra-digital process comes from), the transfer was then cleaned up, color-corrected, restored, and then downsampled for Blu-ray. (Full HD is about 1/4th the resolution of the original scan, at 1920 pixels per row.) Some of this may just be techno-bragging and silly marketing, but the results are clear. Baraka is arguably the best looking Blu-ray on the market, and the 8K process is well worth the effort and expense. I hope other studios will follow suite and devote this level of care to a release.

As for the film itself, its main themes are the universality of the human experience, the diversity of human life, and timelessness. There's no narration or text, so if you're the type who has to have everything blow up, it's best to avoid this disc.

The music, likewise, is timeless, unlike Chronos which has a New Age soundtrack that can get annoying and sounds dated. The music in Baraka has some japanese flute pieces, orchestral pieces, and other ethnic sounds, but nothing terribly memorable. My only issue with Baraka is the paperboard case that it comes in. The disc slips into a slot, which greatly increases the change of scratching. I understand the environmental-friendliness of this decision, but would prefer a better packaging design.

It would've been nice to have an audio track for commentary from Ron Fricke or the producers, because some of the images need explaining, or at least identification as to where in the world they are.

3510453,5,B001CDLAT4,"The psychologically-challenging 1992 film Baraka is richly filled with complexity, gorgeous scenery, and moments that compel you to contemplate. It is opulent in its scope and so alternately awe-inspiring and beautiful that it wields all the greater force to disturb and assault the emotions at those times it chooses to. Certainly I have never seen anything like it.

As its dozens of un-narrated scenes segue without preamble one onto the next, one second showing the natural grandeur of planet earth in all its manifold greatness, the subsequent letting its human cast beckon you into a fleeting instant in their collective but separate lives, I couldn't help but feel my brain launch into some very profound thoughts, and that's the strength of this motion picture.

Along the journey thru Baraka's fast-paced run-time, there are depictions of post-modern city scapes filled with traffic, and villages  that have surely stood unchanged through ensuing millennia. A red rock cliff-faced unaltered through eons might precede a shot of a tree falling to earth, its ephemerally suddenly all the more significant in comparison. There are scenes of prayer at the Wailing Wall, and in Mecca, and in Asian temples, and then there are shots of commerce, computer age manufacturing, the industrial processing of animals whose entire existence is spent in development as a source of human food.

Barack is not only a study in contrasts, it is an exercise in mind-expansion, a near-Sisyphisian effort that coaxes anyone who watches it to reach out and at least seek to grasp the immensity of the planet that surrounds us. It is not unlike the Zen meditation technique wherein instead of shutting out the universe, one is directed to open one's eyes and take in all that is around you, great, small, unseen. That is this film's function.

Also, as I watched south Asian beggars pick through massive heaps of refuse, I couldn't help but notice the clothes they wore were, well, downright beautiful, which left me with Baraka's most profound gift of wisdom: if starving people can wear nice clothing and look good, there's really no excuse for those of us in the developed world not to look our best, now, is there?

Yes, this is a profound motion picture, indeed!",1225843200,,2253,5.02680965147453

I was watching the film just fine when at 1 hour 13 minutes and 23 seconds into the film it froze for about 3 seconds and skipped to the next scene with NO AUDIO for about 10 seconds.

3510474,5,B001CDLAT4,"I won't belabor the comments/reviews left by others; this is an absolutely phenomenal film that deserves a place on the shelf of *any* Blu-ray player owner.  Truly impressive, buttressed by the best high-def video/audio mastering I've seen yet - it looks and sounds fantastic played via my PS3 to a Panasonic plasma HDTV and decoded in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  Buy it.

Unfortunately, the packaging is hippie-dippy crummy.  Yes, it's biodegradable; so much so that it started to degrade during the shipping process!  It's just flimsy cardboard that arrived looking a bit tattered even within the factory shrinkwrap - it'll fall apart with use.

Even worse, storing the disc in the case requires sliding it against the cardboard, which is a big no-no and encourages scratches to form.  A very poor, politically-correct packaging decision for a treasured film that needs to be preserved in perfect condition.

I fixed the packaging today. I'd already purchased a couple dozen new, empty Blu-ray plastic cases to replace broken ones, so I used one of those to repackage this movie.

Instead of cutting up the original box, I first tried scanning it to make new covers, and that worked great. I used 600dpi, 24-bit color, with slight sharpening enhancement and a 133LPI descreening filter to smooth the image. (This was done with an inexpensive Epson 1670 scanner, by the way.) The result is gorgeous!

I saved it as a TIFF file to preserve the scan's full quality, then reduced the front cover 4% and cropped off the top blue ""Blu-ray"" line, unnecessary for a real Blu-ray case. What you should end up with is an image height of 5.875"" with proportional cropping, making the width just about exactly right to fix the plastic case. Printed in highest quality setting on my HP 5550 inkjet (another inexpensive device) it worked perfectly - you have to look very closely to see that it's not an offset-printed factory cover and it fits the new case beautifully.

Similarly for the inside-right image; scanned it using the same specs, then reduced 10% this time to fit the case interior - again, great results.

So, problem solved, and I hope these guidelines might help others.  I've added a couple of hastily-shot photos of my repackaging; they should illustrate the final result - I apologize for lack of time to create more-professional images.

3510480,5,B001CDLAT4,"The Good Things
*Supremely excellent video/sound quality.  Definately one of the best Blu-Rays on the market.
*Includes a couple of extras; a ""A Closer Look"" documentary and a ""Restoration"" documentary.
*The film has very excellent photography.  It shows a vast number of unique images with great composition and quality.  Most of it is downright stunning.
*Also provides some fascinating views of society, nature, people, and the world in general.  If you stop to consider the imagery, it could make you think a lot.
*At the same time, it could also be considered calm and relaxing.
*Provides some views of people, places, and events from many parts of the world that you may never get the chance to see.  It also has some very intimate portraits of people.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*On the selectable items on all menu screens, all of the text is gold and your selection is white, so it's hard to tell which button you are selecting.

The Questionable Things
*This is not a movie with any plot, story, or characters; it's simply a montage of world footage.  If you don't like documentaries, this may bore you.  Otherwise, it will amaze you.
*Comes in an eco-friendly package, so it's entirely recyclable cardboard with the disc shoved in a slit on the sleeve.  It's kind of weird and not very stable.

This film has some of the best photography ever, both in quality and composition.  And on Blu-Ray, it's practically perfect.  In addition to giving me something to stare at intensely, it is also something that will inspire me; its views of foreign people, the things they do, their cities, their ruins, their rituals, and the nature that surrounds them are very detailed and revealing.  And unless you have ADHD, perhaps it will inspire you too.",1225152000,,1753,4.8193979933110365
3510481,5,B001CDLAT4,"Much has been said in the past 16 years of the film itself, so I review the specifics of this version. The newest (and likely final) DVD edition comes from the transfer intended primarily for the Blu-Ray release.  By all means, if you possess a Blu-Ray player, get that disc. (I suggest you look to the numerous videophile magazines slowly putting out reviews on that format).

The boasted 8K UltraDigital HD transfer provides enough information for down-scaling to DVD specs without too significant loss, though the area of greatest benefit from the transfer is the color saturation.  The special features are contained on the second disc, allowing room on Disc 1 for the movie's generous bit-rate and the DTS 96/24 5.1 audio track.  The high bitrate for the video allows for great detail contrast with surprisingly little visual noise, preventing any jarring artifacting in the scenes of high detail in movement (compare the distant shots of large flocks of birds in this DVD versus similar shots in the DVD version of Planet Earth, and the difference is clear).

The surround mix itself is perfectly immersive, and the music could have been done no better justice than to have the new mix restored and overseen by score composer Michael Stearns.

Regarding the special features, I'll first touch on the lesser bonus documentary for the restoration and scanning process. It starts out feeling like an industry advertisement for overscanning with an 8K machine.  Soon, they demonstrate and justify the necessity, artistically, for all this ""technological back-slapping"".  And at six and a half minutes, doesn't overdo it.

The main documentary, ""A Closer Look"", is much more satisfying and steadily interesting.  At an hour and sixteen minutes, this covers the full scope of the entire history, from Fricke's early work with Reggio, to the development of the technology for creating this film, to the many experiences in filming and traveling.  It ends with a few points on the scoring, and a brief discussion of the film's reception and impact.  This documentary benefits strongly from the extensive amount of behind-the-scenes video, as it provides a firm visual anchor for the numerous anecdotes the crew has to tell, and frequently offers touching moments between the filmmakers and the peoples with whom they interacted.

Overall, this DVD is a great piece that shows the strength remaining in the capabilities of DVD in spite of the growth of Blu-Ray.  For the videophiles with an HD monitor not yet buying into the Blu-Ray market, consider this a cornerstone of your ""show-of"" set, yet buy it also for the film's stunning beauty.",1225065600,,2637,5.074074074074074

3510494,5,B001CDLAT4,"BARAKA is a beautiful travelogue directed by Ron Fricke, the cinematographer of KOYAANISQATSI.  It is similar, but superior, to KOYAANISQATSI and its sequels, largely because it doesn't have quite as much of a political axe to grind, and because it is not designed to highlight the music of Philip Glass.

Instead, BARAKA is a profound, moving experience.  I guarantee you will find in it at least a half-dozen moments of pure wonder, and probably many more.  You will also see images of things you've never seen before, or even imagined.  BARAKA explores natural wonders, religious practices, and humans in harmony and in conflict with nature and themselves.  In many ways it remains me of the PLANET EARTH series, but focused on humanity, and with no narration.

BARAKA contains scenes of great beauty, great ugliness, and great humor.  It is also a spiritual meditation, and I make it a point to watch this movie every Easter season, even though it is not particularly Christian in its outlook.

Buy it.  Watch it on the best movie system you or your friends own.  You will certainly enjoy this film.  What I can't say is whether this new DVD release is superior to the old one, which is no longer in print.",1223078400,,1210,4.764423076923077
3510495,4,B001CDLAT4,"I was suggested this movie from a list of historical fiction and historical movies. And while I don't really see the connection so much I'm pleased I watched it anyway.

I have read some of the reviews about the movie and I have to say that I agree with most of them. One person said the movie is really nothing but a screen saver, but it's more than that. And it would make a good screen saver.

It's a wordless film. So if you're looking for that you will not find it here and that may bore you. I also wished they could have put in some context as to what was going on. For the average viewer they would almost be lost as to where in the world they are in the movie and lost as to some of the religious activities that are going on. But this may have spoiled the movie. Just note that this isn't for those not well versed in geography.

The amazing points of the movie is that the photography, I guess you would call it cinematography, is amazing. This is what would make it a good screen saver. The outdoor shots are breath taking and it makes you want to travel the world, or, failing that, get outside and look at your own. The camera tricks are really fun too. I would love to see this in HD. It's also somewhat educational for those who are older. There is some nudity and if you're not comfortable with it, even in a cultural context, then you may want to skip over some parts.

The movie doesn't just stick with the beautiful parts of our world. That would make the movie incomplete. There are some disturbing things. Nothing extremely violent, but some things that will make you think and feel blessed you have so much.

It's totally worth it if you want something calm and soothing. The music is very nice and I found it worth going to sleep to also.",1221868800,,1762,4.232142857142857

3510533,2,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka contains many memorable and poignant images; but in his efforts to find spiritual commonalities amongst vastly differing cultures the director only manages to evoke a constant stream of mindless drivel. From a dread-locked Indian Saddhu suddenly jumping to Hasidic Jews praying at the Western wall in Jerusalem, or slo-mo action shots of Mexican foundry workers then to haunting echoes of Auschwitz in Poland makes it all seem like pointless dreaming. The orthodox Buddhist might call this the product of a butterfly mind, fluttering and flitting all over, however good the editing! By the end I was completely exhausted, even drained of emotion. I still could not work out the central point of the movie, is there a message or something? The best thing for me was imagining what a brilliant time the cinematographer must have had visiting all these beautiful locations, spending all day just filming without a script.

I placed my order without hesitation.  While doing so, I noticed another work -- also entitled Baraka -- and took a moment to read several of the reviews.  It was my thinking, based on certain of the reviews, that this had to be a different project just of the same name.  That being the case, I was prompted to do research on the title, ""Baraka.""  (I learned much from that research.)  Prior to that, however, and with the cover of the DVD being somewhat different, colors and all, I ordered that work as well.  Upon receipt and in early viewing, I realized that it was the exact same as the first Baraka only, this was a ""collector's edition"" with certain photographying enhancements, I guess.  Long story short, I wound-up with two Baraka DVDs.  I realized, however, that this was a good thing for me as I always enjoyed sharing this great work (which is how my VHS tape got away from me).  But now, I can share the Baraka experience without taking the chance of my being left without this awesome work.

3510540,5,B001CDLAT4,"This isn't a film for the casual viewer, especially one who expects something relaxing or serene -- it's not some New Age ""moods of Nature"" Valium! In truth, it's not meant to be watched passively at all, or used as mere soothing background. It's meant to be experienced, the way you'd experience a passionate symphony, or the immensity of the ocean or night sky. Above all, it's meant to engage the viewer, to evoke memories, emotions, dreams, fears -- often quite powerfully, even disturbingly at times. It can be as upsetting as it is exhilarating.

And that's all to the good.

The goal of art isn't simply to entertain (although that's certainly worthwhile in itself). It's to arouse & awaken the individual who encounters it, to stir the soul out of its dull, repetitive patterns, to make both the world & the individual come alive again. If it's successful, it changes you. And this film does all of that -- highly recommended!",1188518400,,934,4.7592592592592595

3510565,3,B001CDLAT4,"I saw BARAKA in theaters, back in the early 1990s.  I was immediately drawn to the eye-popping photography.  The filmmaker spent twelve years gathering footage from over twenty countries, to capture life at its best and worst.  The name of the film, ""Baraka"" is translated as ""blessing"" in several languages.  Was this film a blessing to me?  No, not really.  It felt more like a ponderous, new age journey, set to mind-numbing orchestral accompaniment.  In all honesty, the film repulsed me in many ways.  The director tried to contrast visions of beauty with visions of the grotesque.  Instead, I was left with phantom images of death, torture and sickness, and that superceded any attempts at beauty.  We see the elements exposed (mountains, etc), and I am sure for anyone seeing this film, more recently, these visions of peaks and valleys are poignant, in the age of global warming and environmental trauma.  What's more, visions of people from very diverse cultures almost seemed more exploitative than honorable.  It almost felt as though they were puppets acting in a very strange (and sprawling) incidental play about mortality.  There are shots of skulls, women who have participated in genital mutiliation and glimpses into very tragic events in humankind.  This felt more manipulative than visionary.  Yes, I am aware I am going to receive a lot of flack because I didn't give this film a perfect five star rating, like 95% of the Amazon writers here, but, I must speak my truth.  And, if you asked, ""Should I buy BARAKA, and find out what everyone is talking about?"" I would advise you to pass on this one.",1181606400,,1619,4.875457875457876

""Masterpiece"" is not a term I use lightly. In fact, it's not a term I use at all but it describes this film. First, it is simply beautiful. If you have a home theater system that you take pride in, this is the one DVD to own. It's approximately ninety minutes are spread over two layers: as a result the picture is almost HD-like, especially if you have an ""upscaling"" DVD player and a suitable display.

The music, a combination of Michael Stearn's original score and contributions by artists like ""Dead Can Dance,"" compliment the visuals perfectly.

None of this would matter if the subject of the film weren't worthy of your consideration. Rest assured, it is. I don't trust the words ""spiritual"" or ""spirituality"" but I will make an exception for ""Baraka."" As Fricke puts it in the documentary on the DVD, while we have been invited to live on the planet, life has not given any of us a veto over the guest list. ""Baraka"" is about that ""guest list.""

If we can gaze at their magnificance and some how feel responsible and sympathetic and struck by them... then we have the ability to help. The movie then takes you into our human society.

It tells a story that covers every part of the spectrum of human emotions, from exuberance to grief.

It is amazing. The footage of the Balinese Monkey chant alone makes the film worth seeing. And then there are so many other interesting things, people, and cultural snapshots... it is a smorgasbord of interesting and amazing people and places and rituals and life on planet Earth.

My only complaint is that part of the 2nd half of the film, where modern day ""civilized"" humans enter the picture, is too long, ugly and boring... I realize the idea was to contrast and compare the cultures of more primitive people and the cultures of modern peoples, but I found the modern people boring and unpleasant, and that part of the film goes on a bit too long.

The film does make you think about who we human beings are and how we are all connected, and yet also different; how modern people seem to have lost their connection their own humanity, and to nature; and how we are desroying the life-support system we depend on... This could also have been called ""Koyannisquatsi"" (life out of balance), but I guess that title was already taken. (-;

The soundtrack is superb, and the images are beautiful. I can't imagine any dialogue that would have made the movie better.

Myself, I enjoyed the fast-motion, rat-raced city scenes and their symbolism; also some of the nature scenes from the Galapagos Islands and elsewhere. But much of the rest of it I found to be strange and even creepy.

Be aware that you need to be in the mood for this sort of thing; ""Baraka"" is not suitable for casual slap-dash viewing. I don't know anything about cinematographer/director Ron Fricke or what his trip is, or whether he indulges in ""controlled substances"" and the like.

3510607,4,B001CDLAT4,"I think that Baraka is wonderfully filmed and the images and soundtrack blend together seamlessly. That said, though the images of people's inhumanity to each other are disturbing, what I did not care for is that most of the strongly positive images are of people praying, meditating or involved in some other religious activity, though it goes to the trouble to include all belief systems. Thus, the movie, not so subtly implies that faith is the answer to people's troubles, which a more secular viewer might tend to disagree with. It would have been more interesting if the images were more random and not put together to make a statement and able to let each viewer take away something else from it, as many of the classic experimental films did. Also the score tends to be somewhat new agey. Koyanaqaatsi, though certainly a message movie as well, had a driving electronic score by Philip Glass that held up on its own. However, for the imagery and cinematic experience that can be reproduced in your own living room I would reccomend this film",1157068800,,1049,4.769230769230769

3510612,5,B001CDLAT4,"This film is a uniquely artistic and spiritual achievement. The images and views are spectacular. The planet is shown in its pristine natural beauty, . The volcanoes of Hawaii are viewed from the air and close up, close enough to see the red hot glowing lava arise from the bowels of Mother Earth. The Iguacu Water Falls in Argentina, a Brazilian rainforest and the Kayapo Village Indians, Monument Valley in Arizona, views of Ayers Rock in the Uluru National Park in Australia are among my favorite recollections of natural scenes. The only accompaniment to this fantastic imagery is the original and outstanding music created by Michael Stearns. There are no comments ... no subtitles, none are required, the scenery and images speak for themselves. The film is extraordinairily beautiful, breath-taking, and sometimes dismaying in its truthful depiction of life on planet earth. The concept development by Ron Fricke and the scene development by Mark Magidson and Bob Green are worthy of recognition in the film industry. I am surprised the film gathered no awards ... Its popularity via ""word of mouth"" is likely due to the visual impact of visiting twenty four countries on six continents within 104 minutes ...which is a monumental achievement.

Mankind's impact on nature and the environment are clearly brought into focus without a word being uttered: one views burning oil fields in Kuwait, a garbage dump in India where the poor sort through trash, plus a few stark images of Auschwitz and the skulls and photographs of victims of Killing Fields in Cambodia. The reprimand is felt ... the destruction is seen, the concern for the future is real. Yet the film is balanced showing monuments and pyramids from ancient Egypt, the temples of Angkor Wat, Cambodia ... the terra cotta Warriors in Xian, China ... the Hagia Sophia Temple in Istanbul Turkey ... Mecca, Saudia Arabia ... the Shiraz Mosque in Iran ... St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Jews prayng at the Wailing Wall. The less than satisfying moments for me were, 1) the sped up traffic scenes in New York, 2) views of people getting on and off a train, likely in Japan, and 3) the monkey chant at one of the Far East Asian temples, it seemed too prolonged, my preference would have been to tour the site instead. Cutting out the first entirely and reducing the time viewing the second and third would improve my enjoyment of the film (4.5/5 stars).

The most memorable scenery includes views of children living in poverty stricken areas of South America, the city landfill in Calcutta, India, where poor people sort garbage, and the funeral pyres along the Ganges River ... Words are inadequate to describe these views. This film displays the natural beauty of earth and man's impact on the environment and the world via astonishing images and scenes ... Despite the diversity of the planet, the interconnectedness of life is so well depicted, the film is deeply felt and should be experienced by more people.

3510613,4,B001CDLAT4,"This was a lovely film, no doubt about that. I'm in agreement with most of the reviews here. BUT, can we please note that the huge continent known as Africa was barely represented. I don't know if it had to do with licensing or travel or politics or what? But I fined the fact that only the Massi (and they barley got any attention) and Egypt were the only representations that I saw. This film is being toted as a film that graces the entire world and that is a very inaccurate statement given that Africa is barely given a nod.

That said, it's a given that this film is not what most people are used to. But should all films BE what we are used to? Come on.

I highly recommend this film because it forces you to slow down. Contemplate spirituality from a broad (though not fully inclusive) perspective. And it's gorgeously shot. Yes, it may be a little difficult to get into but not all good things are easy. In the end, it's very very very worth it.",1146960000,,954,4.265193370165746

I realized very quickly there wasn't any narration or text, however I was immediatly drawn in to it and could not look away. The mesmerizing music does go very well with the vivid photography, as mentioned in previous posts here. I'm not going to get into all of the details of the film, since there are so many reviews that include this, however I would like to express my thoughts in general. The photography is, in one word, amazing. Sit back on your couch and tour exotic places in the world we only dream about. Notice the comparisons of assembly line production and commuters in the modern business world. For those viewers who were appalled by the scenes of poverty, the baby chickens, etc., this is the real world. And whether or not you choose to aknowledge these things, they exist.

At that point I decided it was not ok for  my child to see and turned it off. I can't stop thinking about those poor little chicks. Definitely glad I only eat organic eggs.

3510618,5,B001CDLAT4,"I bought this DVD on impulse last week because Amazon paired it with Waking Life, and as I waited for it to arrive, I went hot and cold constantly, at one point thinking ""wow, this must be so powerful and amazing, considering that there's no narration and no traditional plot,"" to ""oof, well, can I sit through ninety-some minutes of this with nothing to tie the images together?""  Let me just say that when all was said and done, my initial excitement was  more than justified.

The language of this film, where in most others we would look to dialogue, is found in the music (which is incredible in its own right-- note to self, see if the soundtrack is available).  Through the segues, peaks, and valleys of the sound, Fricke actually manages to cogently connect such starkly different images as traffic in Tokyo with human breathing, the intensely different architechtures of distant cultures, menial factory labor and upper-class executive professions, prayer and chant-- all the while jumping from one end of the Earth to the other, creating a spectacle of similarity that will leave you shaking your head in amazement.

Surprisingly enough, as is mentioned in certain other comments, there is a poignant emotional charge to the piece as well-- I won't go into details of course, but I have to say I was just as moved by scenes of this film, completely devoid of words and (what I am now forced to view to be) more superficial human drama, as I was by any big-name actor-driven drama like Schindler's List, Green Mile, or anything like that.  Some parts are drop-dead hilarious, others are terrifying.  Never a dull moment throughout.

Meanwhile, to speak of the film more technically, it's still a masterpiece.  This is the first piece I've ever seen that was shot in 70mm film, and I was blown away.  I'll tell you, it doesn't even matter whether or not you've got an HDTV with 7.1 surround sound-- I watched Baraka on a 20"" JVC TV/VCR combo, with its standard stereo speakers-- the depth of field is almost dizzying.  Even simple dolly shots (some scenes toward the end focus most on architechture) are strikingly rendered, and the color quality is absolutely insane.  Every frame could conceivably be printed and exhibited as a professional photograph, but of course then you'd lose the soundtrack!  I can barely begin to imagine what it must look like on an HD display.

Overall, there is not a single thing I can criticize about this movie-- it's quite possibly one of the best I've ever seen, and one I plan to strap all my friends down to watch at some point soon.  Definitely worth the investment to be able to watch it over and over-- my skepticism was totally dashed.

My particular copy was damaged slightly-- I wasn't able to see chapters 5 or 6 when I watched it, but Amazon's been really great about getting a new copy to me as fast as possible, so I'm all-around pleased!  Definitely a great buy-- grab up Baraka straightaway if you're a fan of documentary, experimental film, cultural studies, poetry, photography, anything!",1142208000,,3047,4.762357414448669

I also appreciate that it avoids being a sappy environmental film by being critical of unchecked urbanization and what it is doing to the human soul.

The first time I watched it, I was transfixed. Now I watch the movie every couple months or so. It trully is an experience, and I find that the lack of narrative (and narration) actually adds to the movie's re-watchability, because you don't feel like you're treading over information or story that you're already so familiar with. I just received my copy of the special edition anamorphic version, and what I've seen of it on my high-def TV is just astounding.

It seems the most common complaint is that there is no context provided to the scenes. Initially I did try to think about where the various scenes were and what was going on. However, I've found that if you stop trying to think about the intellectual details of the scenes, only then do you begin to truly *experience* them.

Because I've traveled a lot, I recognized some places, but the scenes shifted without rhyme or reason, moving from continent to continent with  no transition or explanation.  I would have liked some narration (as in ""Winged Migration"").  The scenes soon went from breathtaking to grim.  There was endless footage of thousands of fluffy yellow chicks whisked along on conveyor belts, down chutes, into bins, etc.  A few minutes would have been plenty to demonstrate the cruelty.  One segment focused on the torsos of prepubertal indigenous girls adorned with extravagant beadwork on their shoulders but nothing below. Their vaginal clefts were clearly visible. I found this invasive and offensive, as I could see no point.  While there may be a powerful social message in this DVD, the content was chaotic and the message delivered with a hammer striking everywhere at once.

3510639,5,B001CDLAT4,"I was late getting a DVD player. But there was no question as to which DVD on my ""wish list"" was going to get purchased and watched first. Baraka totally blew me away when I watched it in a theater. The DVD lacks the impact of hugeness that a theatrical viewing offers. But the music doesn't have to suffer one iotta in a home theater setting. And the music is my favorite part. Sometimes, like right now, I will put it on and go about my other activities without watching it at all. I have seen it often enough to see the visuals in my mind just by hearing that magnificent soundtrack.

As a father, I enjoy Baraka for the window it introduces to my family on a wider world. Often it is a disturbing world, at risk of being lost or destroyed by ""progress"" and necessity. It contains stunning natural beauty of course. And man's contribution is often horrible, though not always. I wonder, though, fourteen years after its creation, if Baraka has captured whole segments of a world that now no longer exists. How much has already been lost?

Baraka is a protest film. A naturalist's causa belli statement. A rebuke levelled at our modern fast-paced world which doesn't consider enough the cost of living. The things we squander and destroy and exploit in our current need. Future generations lose because we do not work together to save the unique and beautiful today. All of this I get from Baraka, and the makers do not utter a single word.

My only gripe with this ""silent"" documentary (as in, no voice overs at all) is that it isn't long enough. I wish it were at least a full three hours instead of under two.",1138665600,,1614,4.464406779661017

3510644,5,B001CDLAT4,"It's quite astounding how Baraka could convey such an emotional message without words. The director's choice of images underscored man's sinfulness, his need for redemption, and implicitly, his need for God's grace (and/or connection with a supreme being).

The director's images are bleak; his outlook seems fatalistic in that he deliberately chose the broken, the down trodden, the poor, the bleary, war-torn landscapes. He could have just as easily chosen neutral or positive images: gardeners harvesting fruits and vegetables, people exploring mountain vistas on horseback, modest cities, towns, suburbs, railroads, bridges, et cetera. Instead, he chose to show people and animals scavenging through mountains of trash, mules pulling heavy loads and worked to the point of exhaustion, and dilapidated old shacks in which the extremely poor reside. This wasn't merely a cross-section of humanity -- it was a cross-section of the bleaker aspects of humanity.

Even the neutral images of traffic and people -- sped up to several times their normal pace -- were shown as if to say ""we're no different from the animals."" Images of baby chickens in a factory are toggled with images of commuters packed on subway cars and escalators. An arial view of people at a house of worship are shown as to resemble worker bees or ants scurrying about.

One scene I felt was particularly effective was the way the director humanized the city. It was subtle, but the time-lapse shot of the city at night featured a soundtrack that resembled breathing! Yet the breath was mechanic, almost like an amalgamation of factory/machine sounds. This ""lifeless breath"" was perfectly in time with the traffic flow and it made for an interesting shot.

I know I'm biased in this regard, but I felt the director was East-centric and didn't include enough scenes of Christianity. I don't recall seeing any Protestants, and don't remember seeing worshippers in church. The only time the director zoomed in on a depiction of Christ, the picture had what looked like paint spilled on it and it was in decay. Editorializing? Perhaps.

Baraka is a worldwide story of redemption -- a store of people finding God. Baraka doesn't ask ""how"" as much as it asks ""why"". Baraka presents a voyeur version of religions -- you get to see what's going on, but the specific details don't really matter.

In total, Baraka lays out for the viewer man's sinful nature, and presents religion as a way for man to reconnect with the divine.",1132099200,,2488,5.041362530413625

The glorification of tribal over city life with cityfolk compared to mechanical assembly line productions and hapless chickens, whereas tribalfolk are full of energy and celebration.

Yes, the photography is gorgeous, and many of the scenes are esoteric and intriguing. However, the film's pace is glacial, some of the scenes go on way too long (especially the speeded-up urban traffic sequences), many of the scenes make little or no sense without at least some explanation, and I was unable to discern any sense of logic or connection in the sequencing of many of the scenes.

There are bigger concerns in the world than my petty problems and their is beauty out there that surpasses ordinary eye candy.  There is a big bright beautiful, sad, living, breathing organism called planet earth that is spinning in space.  This is priceless, to me.  But this kind of movie is not for everybody.

My only complaint is that this movie doesn't show all sides, all aspects... but it can't, nor does it attempt to.  It is just that the images become just a tad bit one sided.  Hard to explain, but it is no biggie.  This is a five star ""movie"".",1110412800,,1196,4.224669603524229
3510675,4,B001CDLAT4,"I first saw Baraka in a theater shortly after its release and I have been mesmerized by this film ever since.  Until recently, I had been watching the original DVD release on a small television for years.  I have now made the jump to a Sony 57-inch widescreen.  After attempting to watch the original version on my new big screen, I simply could not put off purchasing the Collector's Edition any longer.

Let's make this clear up front, the Collector's Edition does bring some very much needed improvement.  Watching this film on my big screen is now a very enjoyable and worthwhile experience, despite the image quality still coming up a bit short.  Perhaps I've been spoiled by the razor-sharp picture that comes with today's big DVD releases like Lord of the Rings.  I think it would be fair to say that I'm just being nitpicky.  Nevertheless, a film like Baraka yearns to have a restoration and transfer that's on par with the Star Wars Trilogy DVD's.

For those who have seen this film and enjoyed it as much or more than I have, then this DVD is a very worthwhile purchase.  Those who have not seen it need to rent it first.  Baraka needs to be taken for what it is, a collection of images ranging from beautiful and startling to chaotic and disturbing.  Some have chosen to decry Ron Fricke's acheivement.  I have even seen it called a racist film, which leaves me dumbfounded.  The message that continues to repeat for me each time I see it is the plight of mankind and how our greed, hatred, overconsumption and neglect is shaping our world.",1106006400,,1551,4.572463768115942

The camera shots combined with the music are completely unmatched.  I haven't ever spoken to anyone who didn't love this film.  The best thing to do is to just get it and watch it by yourself.  It is definitely not a film that you talk during.  I'm tempted to write about the content of the film, but I think it is better to be surprised because it is truly a wide eye-opening look at reality.  It is such a powerful video that I'm going to buy another one just to donate to the local video store, because everyone on the planet needs to watch this.

There is this unhuman impartiality in the film that allows a lot  of us to see it not as a message, but as a collection of unrelated beautiful and disturbing (to us) images, all of which try to paint for the alien traveler a picture of our world as inclusive as possible.

This view of life on Earth through an alien's eyes is somewhat distressing - it seems so objective. This film shows that nature does not understand, does not accept human definitions of right or wrong, ugly or beautiful, and it makes us wonder how much our individual lives and our individual values are really worth.",1100995200,,710,4.323308270676692

Buddha said life is suffering---Charles de Gaul said happiness is for idiots.  Simply said,  the film grasps the forces which move beyond our ideology---the rawness of existence-- which one feels in the clouds flowing over the mountains,  or the ancient chants,  or the 4000 year old tree dipected near the end of the film.  The film is not necessarly offering a dualistic choice between the de-spiritualized chicken factory and divine harmony,  but may simply be a snapshot of life----will you embrace it--the cost is great--maybe your sanitized TV,  computer games,  or ideologies seem a little safer.",1099526400,,877,4.837837837837838

What I CAN find fault with is the abysmal transfer to dvd. Its initial release was beyond atrocious, it was excrement. Now, this transfer improves upon it, but when you consider that this film was shot on 70mm film, which inherently offers supremely better resolution than standard 35mm, and its anamorphic coding, the picture quality AGAIN fails to deliver. Who in the HELL was (ir)responsible for working this?

Not only that, but fans are slapped in the face with a meager 8 minute ""featurette"". THAT'S IT. Something this gorgeous and deep should have had so much more.

For the many people who fell in love with Koyaanisqatsi and its sequel Powaqqatsi but were disappointed with the third film of that trilogy (Naqoyquatsi), you may find as I did that Baraka is the film you were wishing for and didn't get.

Like Koyaanisqasi and Powaqqatsi, Baraka is a visual and audiory feast for the senses and soul. A journey into the sacred and the deepest truths of humanity's connection (and disconnection) with the divine and with nature. You will be immersed in the culture-defining rituals of both ancient and modern traditions, and take and extraordinary cinematic journey through 24 countries on six continents. This is the kind of film that can, in 104 minutes, permanently and deeply change your perspective on what it means to be alive on this planet today. And then change it again on the second and third viewings.

Disclaimer: Many people find films in this genre (all visual and musical, with no dialogue or ""story"" in the conventional Hollywood sense of the term) completely unwatchable and ""boring."" You certainly will be disappointed (or at least disoriented) if you are expecting a film with actors playing out a ""plot."" However, if you can open yourself up and give yourself over to an entirely different conception of what film as an artform can be, you may agree that Baraka, like Koyanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi, is one of the most outstanding and moving films of the 20th century--perhaps even of all time.",1096588800,,1581,4.984848484848484

It's unusual in it's conception and the sound-track blends with the images well and would be a good CD on it's own. But let's come down to earth. This is not the religious experience people are making it out to be. These reviews are way over the top. After a couple of viewings I was finding it dragged at times. OK nice mountains. Anytime you fly over big mountains they tend to be fairly beautiful. I would have prefered either a more hard-hitting treatment of war or for the movie to avoid the subject altogether (note: I have not seen any of the Qatsi trilogy).  Could be I'm jaded, but I was disappointed in the end, partly due to too much hype having been made about it on these pages. The ending itself is weak I think and leaves you wondering more about the process than the point of it all. I would certainly recommend a viewing before purchase. No doubt about it though, Ron Fricke's work has been incredibly influential, especially (and very obviously) in the medium of advertising. In general regarding reviews, I have a feeling that most of them are by satisfied customers, so it tends to be biased in favour of the product.",1095897600,,1311,4.351020408163265

None of that appears. Nevertheless the result is riveting! More than 1 and  hours go by with no plot, no narration, and yet the viewer is never bored.

3510713,5,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka is a visual feast like no other, a film that begs to be seen on the largest screen possible so the viewer can absorb the grandiose feel of the images.  This is the type of film that IMAX was made for.  Filmed on a 70mm camera in a total of 24 countries, it is a dialogue-free film that takes the viewer around the globe into uncharted lands.  The first half of the film shows us the natural beauty of earth as we are shown striking images of mountain ranges, deserts, tropical rain forests, volcanoes, solar temples, exotic animals. The whole thing is done to the tune of a spellbinding soundtrack of ambient music, Gregorian chants, flutes and other exotic sounds by world music artists such as Harmonic Choir and Dead Can Dance.
But Baraka is much more than just National Geographic for the visually inclined.  Its purpose is to give us a view of the world good and bad.  And as the second half of the film unwinds, the tone of Baraka becomes increasingly dark and pessimistic as we are exposed to some of the harsh realities of the world like homelessness, poverty, slave labour, hunger.  Horrifying images of tree-chopping, sweatshops, subway-cramming in Tokyo and scenes in a chicken factory will make many cringe and think twice about eating chicken for a while.  But sometimes even within these backdrops of despair can be found things that are beautiful such as the joy and happiness on children's faces despite growing up in poverty-stricken 2nd world countries.  These kids grow up with practically no material possessions yet they seem so HAPPY, much happier than kids of first-world countries who grow up with any material object their heart desires.
Baraka is certainly not the kind of film we are used to seeing.  I struggled with it for the first 10 minutes or so but then immediately fell under its spell and forgot that I was watching a film with no dialogue.  Sometimes it's nice to be able to flick off the brain, not worry about following a story and just let oneself be absorbed by what's on screen, and that's what this film does.  The only minor squabbles I had were the absence of writing on the screen to let us know where in the world we are and that the film did peter out a little towards the end.  Baraka is a film worth purchasing that will stand well to multiple viewings and might even make some think twice about where their real priorities ought to be.",1089504000,,2393,4.591549295774648
3510714,5,B001CDLAT4,"Lets not kid ourselves. This is awe inspiring and captivating film. This review tackles all those who haven't rated it 5 stars. Most of these have seen earlier work by Godfrey Reggio and Ron Fricke. The only thing that separates these earlier works is that some people prefer them over this. In truth, the films are very similiar in technique, time-lapse and camera angles with the only differences being editing, music and locations.
In earlier work Philip Glass composed the music which was appropriate and brilliant (although now slightly dated) and in Baraka, Michael Stearn tried to meld the music to the location. Michael Stearn -in my opinion- creating the better atmosphere.
If you've not seen any of these following Chronos, Koyaanisqatsi, & Powaqqatsi. Then see Baraka, as it is the superior film and tends build on methods, techniques and angles visited in the previous films. I'd also like to mention Alton Walpole who doesn't seem to get much say in reviews, but he's also had an active part in all of these films and part of the 3 main people behind these films.
When you see it make sure that it's on the biggest screen possible, with the best sound system possible in a dark room. And let the music and film take you on the journey that is Baraka.",1088899200,,1263,4.719457013574661

The star-transit scenes especially just don't work. I mean, how many times do we need to see the great arch at Arches National Monument? It was featured maybe 10 times! Or it seemed so.
The film was a good idea, not realized. And a good many scenes are repeated twice, three times, even. Once was plenty.

In the midst of the films evident spiritual concerns, we witness some of life's cruelties: the hungry and the homeless mostly.  Even here the film deftly finds beauty in the faces of the poor without, in any way, masking the dire human consequences of their poverty.  In all of these respects the film is quite exceptional.
In some obvious ways Fricke doesn't trust the viewer's ability to understand the film's spiritual theme.  It heavily contextualizes its theme by beginning and ending the film with people engaged in spiritual practices, almost as if it is announcing ""This film will be about spirituality"" and, later, ""Don't forget this film was about spirituality.""  In that respect, Fricke made the film too easy.  Also, Fricke relies too heavily on time-lapsed photography.  That would be a perfectly acceptable technique if Fricke had done something new with it.  But how many times have we seen nature scenes with clouds rushing overhead or the rapid time changes from day to night and back to day again?
New age types will find the film flawless because it mostly privileges non-western spiritual practices. Hedonists (like me) will enjoy it as well: the film is unquestionably a visual feat.",1072051200,,1361,5.067264573991031

3510736,5,B001CDLAT4,"And crank down the bass a little (if you have a subwoofer).
This movie gives the person with their DVD players, SUV and well- paying job to see something in this world that the viewer most likely has not seen, which is an intimate look at cultures, environments and nature the world over. With no concern of SARS or an expensive plane ticket, you feel afterwards that you truly experienced a global tour.
Baraka begins at a rather cautious pace, and as each scene passes by your vision, the intensity and depth slowly but steadily increases. It's a bit hard to describe, but I feel in a way that it causes the viewer to look inward at his/her own view of what the world is about and what life means. In a way, it compells you to ask yourself some deep questions. Make sure to keep your attention on watching the movie with NO interruptions to get the full effect. Pausing for phone calls, snacks or bathroom breaks is verboten, so get everything done first!
Baraka unfolds in the early morning and as the film passes through the first 10 minutes or so, you see examples of different beliefs and religions mixed with clips of nature. Eventually the two collide. And by the end, you're amazed at the solar eclipse and lunar starfields. Yet Ron Fricke's intent wasn't to make any statement at all.
There are elements of almost every type mixed into the film from peaceful co- existance to conflict (no graphic footage, don't worry), faith, technology, beauty and struggle. In some ways you may feel helpless after watching the slow decay/destruction of the world at the hands of mankind, yet Fricke also inserts visions which somehow reassure that nature ultimately holds the key to the fate of human beings since she is infinitely more powerful (and is much more patient).
If you get the chance, sample Baraka (a national video rental place has it on stock in special interest, so you can take a peek at it), and you'll more than likely want to own this. The majority of filming is either in slow motion or in time lapse, with not a single word spoken. Fricke and Mark Madigson developed some camera and dolly techniques that created the smoothest time lapse photography available, and some of the filming they've done you may recognize in some commercials or even movies.
NOTE, this is for the earlier MPI version DVD (DVD7060), which is somewhat similar in content, and the never version claims a new 70mm transfer and digitally- remastered audio. One thing I noticed that wasn't noted in the specs on the Collector's Edition is they didn't mention a full screen version; the older DVD is double- sided, one for the widescreen and the other for pan & scan.
Other suggestions: Koyaanisqatsi (deals mainly with the industrial cultures, cinematography by Fricke, 1983), Chronos (by Fricke, 40 minutes, 1985 which has music a little dated, but the film techniques are similar) and Powaqqatsi (1988). Of these, Baraka is best, IMHO.

They are two different films taking different approaches on similar themes. One is clearly linear with a clear-cut, uncompromising message that basically dictates your experience of the movie (Koyaanisqatsi), while the other (Baraka) is non-linear, a patchwork exploration of critical contemporary issues that allows you to make your own subjective interpretations on what you are seeing. That is where Baraka's power lies - that no two people experience and see exactly the same thing, that the experience isn't dictated to you.
Some see it as depressing, some see it as uplifting, some maybe even see it as a waste of film! and a lot won't GET it. I'm a major movie buff, and personally, subjectively, Baraka is the closest attempt I've seen spiritual enlightenment depicted on film.

The music is also great and matches the film very well -- if you like Peter Gabriel's ""Passion"" (the instrumental soundtrack to The Last Temptation of Christ), you will like the score for Baraka.
I disagree with the reviewer who said that Baraka is just an imitation of Koyaanisqatsi.  If you'd bother to read the credits, Ron Fricke (the creator of Baraka) was also responsible for ALL of the filming for the -qatsi trilogy (which includes Koyaanisqatsi).  Baraka is a different kind of movie, with a different, more subtly communicated message.
Baraka was shot in the (very expensive) 70mm format, which yields a very high quality picture, especially when transferred to DVD.  Ron Fricke is a master of the 70mm format, and he actually designed many of the camera rigs used in Baraka (including the very high quality time lapse footage).  Give Fricke some credit for having learned something in the almost 10 years since Koyaanisqatsi was filmed.
If you are expecting vapid, New Age eye candy, this is not the movie for you.  If you want a beautiful film that will change you, a film that you can watch again every 6 months without getting tired of it, then buy this DVD.

3510801,3,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka - meaning ""blessing"" in Arabic - is a film which presents images of our world and of various human societies.  There is no ""script"" as such and as the film progresses various human actions and landscapes are juxtaposed to make points about man and his environment.  Music is used to create more depth in this process and to govern the pace and feel of the cinematography.  It's all very well done and the visual impact is great. All in all a very watchable and involving film.
My one major gripe is that this has really been done before and rather better, too.  ""Koyaanisqatsi"", a colloboration between composer Philip Glass and cinematographer Godfrey Reggio covered this same ground with more panache and a stunning soundtrack courtesy of Mr Glass.
My immediate impression of this film then is that it is straight plagiarism ie an uncredited copy of someone elses artistic creation.  Having seen both films it is very hard for me to escape from this impression.  Worse, Baraka does not really improve on the original in any way.
My suggestion would be to buy the original Koyaanisqatsi and to watch that.  In reality it is an extremely influential film and the techniques and approaches which it pioneered have been copied and emulated in hundreds of other productions from films to adverts to MTV-type videos.  The added bonus here is the soundtrack which in isolation is a good example of modern classical music which has acheived enormous public popularity.  Together the cinematography and the music work well together and the result is an immensely watchable example of original and significant filmic creativity.
This review in no way criticises the actual film ""Baraka"", which in itself is an involving film, but is suggesting that the original which sparked the ideas remains the better film and should be watched in preference.",1035417600,,1845,4.964285714285714

It turned out to be so much more, and perhaps the best value [money] can get you now.
Everything about this production is flawless. From Fricke's shots and use of cinematography, the segues he uses, the soundtrack, it all integrates seamlessly into one beautiful that cannot be described.
If you ever liked anything by Kubrick this will blow your mind. Even if you don't like Kubrick, you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try. Even if the deeply intellectual aspect of the movie does not appeal to you it gives the watcher a great view at every end of the Earth imaginable in exquisite detail.",1035244800,,977,4.719298245614035
3510803,4,B001CDLAT4,"I have to say that while I first watched the movie the movie was a big drag--I just wasn't in the mood for that type of music. Well, I happen to have been watching it on my computer, so I turned the volume off on the movie, played an mp3 of DJ MF (DrumNBassics), which you can download off kazaa, or if not, write me and I'll send you a copy. I have to tell you the music perfectly complimented the music. I saw it all the way through, with the dj set having to be played about 2.5 times. A strange thing happened while I was listening: When I had to replay the set, that's when the film switched over to the Asian industrialized city. Whoa. Anyways, I recommend this movie for all the dnb heads out there. It's hard for us to get any thing real out there, and this movie is about as real as it gets. There's no dialogue or plot to this movie, but it's still more than worth watching. By leaving these things out, he frees himself in other ways. The landscape is amazing, the theme of the movie is strictly up to you, and the journey is well worth it.",1034121600,,1051,4.082125603864735
3510804,5,B001CDLAT4,"I saw this film in its original 70mm glory before I had any idea what it was.  Not knowing anything about made it all the more spectacular.  All I was told is 'you gotta see it'.
It is a symbiosis of sound and sight in a truly unique synthesis.  One without the other leaves one with a sense of absence.  Yet the two together are perfect. Michael Stearns provides a soundscape that buoys music from around the world.  Add to this stunning scenery and fascinating people both at play and at work from around the world and you've got a delight for the senses.  You really do just have to see it.
Personally I have to watch it when I'm alone as most people I know simply think the movie to be a bit odd as it is not your traditional 'movie'.  Yet it is so much more than a documentary or some kind of advertisement for the Sierra Club or something.  It is truly something to be experienced.
Now for the bad news.  The picture quality on the DVD is spectacular, so too the songs.  However, there are some moments of rather loud static in between the songs.  It sounded to me at first like the wind or part of the film but then I realized it's not.  It sounds like tape hiss (and I know for certain that it isn't my sound system).  Perhaps bad transfer or a bad original, I don't know, but it is almost, though not quite, distracting enough to put a damper on it.
So five stars for the film and the music, four (even three) on the DVD.",1033344000,,1430,4.156363636363636

3510807,2,B001CDLAT4,"As a great fan of that poem of pure cinematography Koyaanisqatsi, I bought and viewed Baraka because it had been recommended as being along the same lines.  Well, yes, some of the scenes (and the general concept) seem to be practically copied from Koyaanisqatsi, but in general, my reaction is that while Koyaanisqatsi is one of those rare works of pure inspiration, Baraka is simply a work of pretention.  It could be an emblem for the New Age generation, in its skin-deep grasp of spiritual traditions, juxtaposed on the screen simply because some visual aspect of the previous scene resembles a visual aspect of the current scene, but with no appreciation of the underlying meaning of what is depicted within the cultural context.  Even the sound track almost completely ignores any authentic musical heritage associated with the images shown.  Where the cinematographer of Baraka seems to have been attempting to portray continuity or perhaps universality of the spiritual life and its artifacts and rites, in fact the result is little more than visual punning.  It takes great commitment and devotion of years of study and practice to plumb the depths of any spiritual path, and no facile movie presentation of a string of pretty images like a smorgasbord of plastic hors d'oeuvres is going to reveal any important spiritual messages.
However, like New Age ""fast food spirituality"" fare, while there is nothing there to be taken very seriously, hopefully some pretty and stimulating images (extraordinarily beautiful photography!) may inspire curiousity in some viewers to look into the briefly presented phenomena in more depth.  In this way, the movie may end up making a cultural contribution after all.

It is addicting just because every time one whatches the film, deeper he/she goes and more is found there, beyond the images. The scenery an sondtrack are so rich and work so well together that this sinergy actually makes the film being felt as emotions.

The producers, interviewed in a behind-the-scenes documentary, also seem oddly dispirited. The poor DVD transfer -- obviously from an analog source and abounding with artifacts and interlace flicker -- reinforces one's disappointment. They even missed a great opportunity to provide alternative audio tracks or captions with descriptions of what we're seeing.

From Monkies relaxing in Japan's hot springs to the iguanas on the shores of Galapagos to a Buddhist monk walking through Shinjuku station in Japan, there is powerful emotion brought into one's mind about the idea of life and one's concept of the world.  I feel one of the themes of Baraka is the conflict of human technology and nature.  But even with the the conflict and destruction that the human technology brings, you can witness its clockwork-like beauty in dense cities like New York or Hong Kong.  There are other parallels between the densely populated South American cities and gravesites.  The same parallel flows with Shinjuku station and the egg factory.  It is a great metaphorical representation that you couldn't quite put into words.  You would have to be Blake to capture Baraka's beauty and you would have to be Vonnegut to reach the level of irony and cynisism it provides the viewers with.

3510868,5,B001CDLAT4,"""It's not where you are that's important, it's what's there.""
  -- Ron Fricke, director/photographer
Baraka is a Sufi word that means ""essence.""  It also translates into various world languages as ""breath"" or ""blessing."" BARAKA the movie (MPI Home Video) is a non-narrative tour de force of images and sounds that captures the sacred dance of life on our home planet.  Filmmaker Ron Fricke shot this rich visual mantra on 69 locations in 24 countries.  From the opening credits with dawn gilding the frozen peaks of the Himalayas to the fade out of the gracefully rotating starfields above the Egyptian ruins of Karnak's gigantic columns, we are exposed to the rhythmic designs of time and light embedded in our spaces, whether it be a wave of clouds cascading down the walls of the Grand Canyon, or whirling dervishes in Istanbul.  World religions and their rituals are gracefully contrasted with not only the shifting patterns in nature, but also the sometimes disturbing but equally mesmerizing flow of human activity.  The rituals and that accompany the Wailing Wall at Jerusalem are shared with the time lapse patterns of New York's subway riders, the unsettling symmetry of a cigarette factory assembly line and Calcutta's homeless foragers and so on.  Butt dancers, death camps, stone figures, Tiananmen Square, volcano's fervent meanders at night, post war oil fires, mauve tinted bird migrations, a Tibetan monk rings a great bell -- the sounds and images merge and blend and eventually become something much more than their individual elements.
Surrender to this extraordinary experience and participate in a kind of high, an altered state, that generates a sense of connectedness, dare I say, a shared, hard-wired desire to glimpse a Grander Design that runs through all.
Baraka is a stunning film that is perfectly matched and greatly enhanced by Michael Stern's exquisitely designed original score that includes richly textured ambient, natural, tribal, industrial and religious elements along with his percussive, string and voice-as-instrument sweeteners.
Language cannot do justice to this unexpected, amazing and dazzling film.  It may not be for everyone, but for those who desire a meditative, provocative and spiritually refreshing recess from the stressors of the mundane and ordinary, it is highly recommended.  And it does not lose its appeal with repeat viewings.  The DVD release is a completely new, pristine, Todd-AO 70mm, ultra widescreen (2.20:1) transfer with very crisp sound.",1003190400,,2507,5.321518987341772

It offers panoramic glimpses of Mother Nature at its most serene and tumultuous, from ocean waves at sunset to bubbling magma pools inside volcano hollows.  It shows humans/human existence at both the best and worst: stunning cathedrals and temples, slumming prostitutes and the swarming masses of consumers.
The editing and sequencing are intentional throughout, from the opening shot of a white-furred monkey in a Japanese hot springs to the montage of human religion rituals juxtapositioned together, displaying the basic similarities of human faith.  Children in Ecuador observing life behind protective bars; the dispossessed of India rooting through trash heaps to gather sustenance; a train of bugs swiftly crawling over the surface of a leaf while the tree itself is slashed down, another casualty of the Amazon...if a single picture is worth a thousand words, then the multitude of visual shots in Baraka could fill a library.
Sound is mostly limited to the atmospheric music of Dead Can Dance, Enigma, etc., with a few notable inclusions: monks chanting in ritual, the clip-clop of a mule.  There is no speech, nor is any needed.  Personally, I had no difficulty identifying the locals; most are fairly obvious to the experienced eye.

I believe this was released over 8 years ago, but it is a timeless work- it could have been done yesterday, and I'd be none the wiser.  One thing about the editorial review I'd like to point out- it is a little frustrating not knowing where you are sometimes during the DVD- it even comes with a little insert that shows the world, and all the areas where filming took place- if it really doesn't matter where they are, then I wish that they did not include that- because it does become irksome trying to match up the places that they list, with what you were watching.

Complimented by the stirring soundtrack of Michael Stearns, every time I watch this film, it raises the deepest emotions from inside.
It's message is simple - that every man and woman on this Earth are striving for something more, through religion, war, ceremony, class, etc..., we are searching long and hard.  As well, this film is unforgiving in the assesment of our failures along the way.
The most beautiful image in my mind is that of a family riding on a scooter with the sun glittering behind them as they calmly go about their business.  All of this is amplified by a stirring track by Lisa Gerard (Dead Can Dance) that finally disolves into a haunting Japanese dance.

Or that only good movies have Hollywood actors with mainstream sensibilities. Formula, mediocrity, and lack of imagination: this is capitalist McCulture as we see it in USA Today.
BARAKA has no actors, no words, no glossy Hollywood faces. It`s non-linear, has no ""plot"", but clearly a message to whomever views it with the right eye. It is High Art.
It is deep. Subtle. Complex. Profound. Timeless. Mystical. Horrifying. Achingly beautiful. I also wish to describe it as universal but I won`t, because from my experience most people in the mainstream just won`t GET it. This is not a judgement. It is an observation.
Though I came away from the movie feeling that I`ve just witnessed a timeless universal masterpiece, when I showed the movie to a relative, his reaction was quite upsetting to me initially. ALL he saw was the surface and technical aspects of the film/making i.e. ""woah dude, an eclipse"" or (ignorantly)""that tribsman`s getting groovy"". I later came to realize that not everyone will come away from this movie with the same response. It`s not that he was wrong in his opinion; it`s the fact that he didn`t have the faculty for understanding and/or appreciating such a movie.
BARAKA communicates to you what cannot be communicated through words. It is a movie that can only be grasped in its totality, profundity and significance on an intuitive level. Fricke is clearly aware of the limitation of words. Like all the greatest works of art, BARAKA points away toward a direction that is more profound than the object of your observation. I`m not a Christian, but to use the necessary language, this is GOD communicating to You. The closeup image of a Japanese snow monkey, incredibly human-like, resting, meditative, still, aware, awake, ever present, is probably the most beautiful and eloquent capturing of Buddhahood I`ve ever witnessed on film.
I could not talk for two days after watching BARAKA for the first time. I felt as if I`ve left my body. It hit me that hard. It shows what crazy times and the crazy world we live in, that it is both full of horror and beauty, and will always be because to know what beauty is we must be aware of that which is not.
As for the content of the DVD, I have to give it a C or 2 stars. This is unfortunate and unusual since Baraka has become quite the cult favourite in repertory cinemas around the country and for audiences worldwide. The DVD does not do justice for the type of curiousity fans like myself want to fulfill. The movie was well over five years in the making from what I`ve read and only eight minutes have been devoted to the featurette. I`d say a least a half hour should go towards this considering how long the movie took to complete. Also, a director`s commentary would have been most satisfying - I can`t imagine Ron Fricke having nothing to say during the making of the film as we`re watching the movie, I mean, he`s put his heart and soul into this project and has had immense complications for it`s actualization.
Nonetheless, for me, it is up there with the greatest works of art/cinema in this century. And if you can, try to watch it in the theatre with, hopefully, a good sound system.
And you don`t need to be an ""artsy fartsy"" to appreciate it!",987638400,,3340,4.691652470187393

There is no dialogue in the entire film and Fricke combines many obscure human practices with that of every day corporate life.  The entire experience is like a William Burrows cut-up fused with a National Geographic movie and a spiritual teach-in by Ram Dass.

BARAKA honors them as human beings first, and passes no judgement. Masterful.
A two hour movie without actors, without dialogue, but it reaches into my heart and soul and gave it a good tug. BARAKA has touched and moved me. Thank you and bless its director and creators for such a work of soul and art.
Some of the scene changes are abrupt, some scenes I can't place or figure its context, but these are really minor flaws in the grand scheme of things. The soundtrack is extraordinary, subtle and totally appropriate.

That's not an easy  thing for someone who thought that Koyaanisqatsi was one of the most  visually breathtaking films ever made (along with Kubrick's 2001), but  Baraka expands its territory to include the entire globe, with a  combination of images and music that inspires thoughts as to what exactly  the filmmakers had in mind, much like 2001, in invites speculation as to  the meaning of its intent. Is Baraka simply gorgeous eye-candy?  Maybe, but  I really doubt it.  I can see how it would be very easily dismissed by  people of ""right-wing"" political values as being  ""New-Agey"" and ""ultra-leftist"", but I think that would  be missing the point as well.  Filmmaker Fricke has presented us with a  meditation on the defintion of what is to be human, in all its various  guises, and in effect showing how rich our peculiar species really is.

Indeed the movie  is about human- environment interaction, but its focus is on the meanings  of habit, ritual and symbol as uniting the two.

The other time I saw it in the theater, it was badly out of focus.  I  wouldn't be so picky about this except that the movie has no plot and is a  purely aesthetic film.  At any rate, I was looking forward to seeing  Baraka on DVD.  Sadly, what I found was the worst transfer to DVD I have  ever seen.  What should have been clear and smooth was blocky and choppy.  It was obvious that the producers lacked the technology to transfer the  film directly to DVD and had instead chosen to transfer a projected image.  There are points where you can see imperfections not only on the film, but  also on the screen itself.

3511039,5,B001CDLAT4,"This has to be in the DVD collection of every DVD lover. I have not seen a more visually spectacular DVD. The audio composition played back in 5.1 is also a delight, blending seamlessly into a real feast for the senses.",948844800,,219,4.365853658536586
3511040,5,B001CDLAT4,"Baraka is one of the rare films that really captures the beauty and essence of our worlds many landscapes and cultures. The cinematography(originaly shot in 70mm)is by far the best of any movie ever made. The soundtrack (Michael Stearns, Dead Can Dance...) is equally  impressive , creating a visual and audio experience like no other. One  leaves the theater truly inspired and euphoric. I own the video,  the soundtrack and can't say enough positive things about this  movie. Buy it and set aside 2 hours with no phone calls, no bills, no  interuptions...and truly take in what this movie has to offer.",947462400,,604,4.882352941176471
3511041,5,B001CDLAT4,"Yes, you can not get the full impact if you didn't see it in the theatre, but it is still worth owning.  Show it to your classroom, friends, get the word out: this video is a significant, optimistic, crucial view of  civilization, mankind and humanity.",946857600,,252,4.5777777777777775
3511042,5,B001CDLAT4,"As others have said, this masterpiece should be in DVD format.  Who can we write to get this to happen?  If there could only be one movie in DVD,  this would be it.",945043200,,164,3.909090909090909
3511043,5,B001CDLAT4,"I actually saw Baraka on cable and only saw part of it.  I too felt as if it was a meditation on the diversity of the world.  It made me feel that there are many different ways that people live their daily lives, and no  one way is right or wrong.  It makes me realize how insignificant we really  are here in the U.S. when you are able to see lives around the entire  globe.  The soundtrack is also very moving.  I wouldn't mind having that  to listen to while I'm in rush hour traffic.",945043200,,487,4.042105263157895
3511044,5,B001CDLAT4,"This is a movie of absolute brilliance.  Not only should it be shown in schools, but also seen by every other person. The intensity and exactness was astounding and touching.  Learning not only about the world but also  about yourself is wonderful and frightening. The scenes from around the  world are captured with such honesty and put together with music to match.  A masterpiece that will be hard to beat.",944265600,,409,4.785714285714286

3511046,5,B001CDLAT4,"It's amazing how a visual stimulant, as this film is, can put one into a transhipnotic state to where they feel the innocence and beauty of the cultures they are being exposed to.  Baraka reminds us of how the modern  world has blurred the focus on ancient cultures and religions. And with the  images Baraka shows us, I feel as though we are forgetting the importance  of the Old World and being reminded of how industrial the Western world  lives.  What an amazing film!",937872000,,472,4.559523809523809
3511047,5,B001CDLAT4,"The most poignant and powerful film I have seen.  This movie shakes the viewer from her comfortable seat and calls her to question not only the dominant paradigm but personal values and beliefs. Baraka should be seen by  everyone because it has the ability to affect us all and calls us to  question our lifestyles.  The cinematography is incredible and the music is  carefully crafted.  Definately a film to be viewed on the big screen, but  this should not discourage anyone from renting it.",928195200,,493,4.7976190476190474
3511048,5,B001CDLAT4,"This film has never lost its excitement for me even though I have watched it many times.  As a person who has travelled around the world, I use it often as a gift for people who may not experience the places and the  mesmerizing sounds the planet has to offer. As an 8mm film with no  dialogue, our children did not see the point of it.  As a film with no  dialog but wonderful tracks of music, chants, it is a great meditational  adventure.  My favorite.",922838400,,455,4.22093023255814
3511049,5,B001CDLAT4,"I saw this while on an island in the pacific and felt closer to the rest of the world while simultaneously a speck in the ocean, ""drop in the bucket"", and gald I was not an ""ant of the city"" or worse,  the ""army""....  Nevertheless happy to enjoy an insignificant,  wonderful life fully aware of how far we have come, and how we can only  change our tiny portion.  Awesome!!!",916272000,,374,4.285714285714286

8287118,2,B001CDLAT4,"If you're looking for stunning visuals and music that tell a story on their own, see Powaqqatsi or Koyaanisquatsi. I saw those first and was blown away. Was looking forward to Baraka as well but was wholly disappointed. Baraka has several scenes with pretty visuals, but falls far short of what you get with the Quatsi series. Baraka comes across as a hastily made cheap knock-off of Quatsi.
If having a ""Rolecks"" watch makes you happy, you'll probably enjoy ""Baraka"" too.",1515024000,,472,4.839506172839506
