2047314,4,B0001ZX0C4,"Overall this is a good R rated strip show.  It features lots of  models posing in a variety of revealing ways. Most are quite pretty but there are no glamour ""10"" girls here.  I didn't like that all of them pose same way...quick and mechanical. They are sexy but have no real sizzle or seductiveness. It seems they were all coached by the same stripping adviser a few minutes before the shoot.  With a title like ""Flirts in Skirts"" I had expected to see lots of sexy leg shots. The camera doesn't really spend much time enjoying the models legs or feet. There is no pink in this video either.  The cameraman is very fixated on the breasts of each model.

If you're looking for a sexy strip show I recommend Sara St James&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sara-St-James/dp/B00000JSK5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sara St. James</a>.  Sara is an absolute 10 and she knows how to sizzle for the camera.

I've seen quite a few R rated strip shows.  This one gets a 3.5",1235606400,3,1003,4.958083832335329
2047315,3,B0001ZX0C4,"Hotbody's FLIRTS IN SKIRTS

FAR BETTER than any Playboy or Penthouse videos. But let's get rid of the John Cross appearances, nobody is buying these or any videos to see or hear from John Cross.

Just like Mike from Glendale CA said, these Hotbody videos need more pizazz. Many of their videos have some fine women along with some clunkers maybe half and half, but it's like they are in slow motion. I bought their naked bull rider video, which you'd think would have had great potential right? Not so much, it fell far short of the great video it could have been. Some of the ladies where hot, but the bull was slowed way down, making for a boring ride every time.

NOTE TO JOHN CROSS: Please stay off the video and it's soundtrack. Let's venture past the same old boring strip show, shot in your bedroom. Let's speed these videos up, maybe some hoolla hoop, some trampoline action, herky jerky bull riding (done right), or how about some fast pace Latin dancing, hi impact aerobics and fitness or many other types of action sports, with beautiful naked women would be nice. Your videos have potential, they just need more! When you get it right please remember my suggestions and send me my share of the profit.",1231200000,2,1213,4.555045871559633
2047316,4,B0001ZX0C4,"Flirts in Skirts is 55 minutes long and was released on June 8, 2004. Lonnie introduces the show to us. We have eight models\strippers in short skirts taking off what little clothes they have. Each of the models reveals their flirting technique to us. The models are:

1. Avery Adams from Las Vegas, Nevada
2. Tonya James from Costa Rica
3. Ashley Fires is the Discovery Winner from Fetish Fever and is a southern California native
4. Sheena is from Oregon
5. Bella Star lives in Los Angeles, California
6. Autumn Austin is from southern California
7. Breanne
8. Lonnie is from Hemet, California

Once the models are done stripping for us we see all eight of them outside with skirts and panties on, performing for us. Then we get to see them without their panties. Finally we get to see Avery Adams and Lonnie one more time. The thing that I like most about this video is that the ladies do the talking. Flirts in Skirts gets a B+.",1208304000,,932,4.476470588235294
2047317,2,B0001ZX0C4,"I saw this DVD and Naughty Nurses, and I think I liked the Naughty Nurses one better.
These Flirts in Skirts girls stripped out of things, and they were pretty, but I wish there would've been a bit more pizzazz to the whole thing. There just seemed to be a piece of the puzzle missing, but I just couldn't put my finger on it.
One girl was writhing around on a rug on the floor as she was stripping; and, oh, I don't know, it just didn't seem like it had as much glitz and sparkle as I would've liked. The person or persons who put this all together should've hired a choreographer and got better sets. The thing just seemed like it needed more style or polish....somehow.
Some guys will like this because it has PINK, and that's the only criteria some guys have when they see things like this. Yeah, it had P I N K, so some guys will be HAPPY; but, oh, I don't know, I just wanted a little more.",1208131200,7,896,4.1257142857142854
2047318,4,B0001ZX0C4,"My faith in Hot Body has been restored....somewhat. I certainly liked this disk much better than the last one I got (Blondes Tease, Brunettes Please). Flirts in Skirts is more of a 1st-rate effort. While the ever-present John Cross is still there, with his, at times, annoying banter, it's at least tolerable. This volume is a good example of what guys pay to see......lovely women showing their all, tastefully done. While featured model Avery Adams is stunning and cover girl Lonnie Waters looks quite nice, newcomer Sheena has to be one of the hottest redheads I've ever seen. And saving the best for last is the sizzling Breanne.

You can't please everyone all the time, but I think most guys would be more than satisfied with this DVD.",1178236800,10,740,4.78125
2047319,5,B0001ZX0C4,"Another great DVD from Hot Body. The girls all spread their legs for the viewer. If you like looking at women showing you what they have 'down there' this is for you. The best part of this particular DVD is that nearly all the girls seem to have either natural breasts or they have a better class of plastic surgeon than some.

The ladies are lovely, the skirts while they are on are short and the entertainment value is far superior to the likes of Playboy or Penthouse offerings. A good buy.",1158105600,28,493,4.358695652173913
2047320,4,B0001ZX0C4,"As a veteran of HBI videos, it is clear to me that you either like this kinda stuff, or you don't. Flirts in Skirts is a good one and gives you what you want.

1. Production - the usual, nicely lit and shot, clear, good. As always, too much talking from John Cross.

2. The action - the standard dancing, posing, gyrating. Sexy, got the job done for me. They don't waist much time getting naked. Always some girls who are better/hotter than others. A must for the mini-skirt lover, as they are short, plentiful and w/ nothing underneath.

3. The Girls - numerous girls, a couple clunkers, but mostly very hot. Highlights are Angel Fires & Lonnie (blonde on the cover).

4. The Pink Factor - Hot Body's calling card - what separates them from boring Playboy videos, inconsistent Penthouse videos and the other ""stuff"" on amazon, etc... - great spreads and lingering close-ups, front and rear. No ""hide the prize"". Great pink and plentiful.

Basically, this formula of theirs is pretty simple and fool-proof - hot babes, fully nude and exposed in sexy routines and positions. Works for me.",1151625600,40,1087,4.670157068062827
2047321,3,B0001ZX0C4,"I would have rated higher, if it were not for the constant talking of the owner of the company while trying to watch the girls. Half way through the show, (HE)the owner of the company makes an on screen apearence, a real downer! also the flash photograpy going on in the back ground was very distracting.",1137888000,7,304,4.446428571428571

8019025,5,B0001ZX0C4,If you like naked women you can't go wrong with Hot Body.  The quality of the women varaies but you usually get a lot to look at.  This is true for this show.  With covergirl Lonnie and Avery Adams and several others holding nothing back this is a good tape.  John Cross does less talking than normal and the women get too talk a good amount.  I got the vhs as it is $10 or more cheaper than the dvd.  If you still have a vhs player save some money as it is the same show.,1388620800,,472,3.8645833333333335
8019026,5,B0001ZX0C4,Those of you who have grown up with Hot Body videos know exactly what to expect. Beautiful women in a softcore adult dvd. Full frontal and even closeups. The sad thing is that Hot Body is no longer producing new dvd's or VHS tapes and the prices are actually starting to rise. Check out ebay for some ridiculous bidding on Hot Body VHS tapes. When you find dvd's for less than $17 snatch them up. There aren't many out there and Flirts in Skirts is definitely one to grab.,1333756800,,472,4.314606741573034
8019027,5,B0001ZX0C4,"As with all their videos, Hot Body delivers the beautiful women, posing in softcore situations. Always FFN and tastefully done! Playboy could take some cues. But now, 2012, Hot body is no longer creating new videos, nor are they producing dvd's of their previous works. If you are a collector and missing any of these Hot Body videos and find dvd's or VHS tapes, buy them. They are becoming scarce and starting to demand high prices.

All reviews I make are of videos I actually own and don't just recommend on a whim. See my other reviews for reference. I can recommend Hot Body's Flirts in Skirts for the softcore afficionado.",1333756800,2,628,4.657657657657658
8019028,4,B0001ZX0C4,"As with all Hot Body DVD'S, director John Cross needs to shut the f*** up and stay the f*** off the screen!  I believe that I speak for nearly all men when I say that the ONLY reason to watch these DVD'S is to see the women.  When I watch these DVD'S I always turn off the sound so that I don't have to listen to his extremely annoying and totally pointless voice-overs!  What a huge intrusion when trying to watch the ladies!  Also, I always skip any parts where he or any other males appear on screen.  Keep the screen appearances and all sound to the ladies and music only!  Wow, Autumn Austin!  something about her really gets to me!  I've seen her on another company's DVD'S as well and I just love seeing her!  The other girls on this DVD are great as well.  Just keep John Cross's voice and appearances off of these DVD'S as well as any other males and they would have something good here!",1333497600,,896,4.2176470588235295
