8407868,1,B003X8596Q,"John Neumeier has produced some very fine ballets, so, when this came out the expectations were high. Unfortunately, this is not up to his usual standards. In fact, it would be difficult to imagine a worse example of a ballet than this. Neumeier has taken a great score performed by great artists, a great ballet company consisting of great dancers, and great theatrical resources and managed to completely squander them. What we have here is mostly a bunch of walking, staring longingly, escorting, positioning, and some twitching. Neumeier, himself, plays Jesus Christ. We see that he can still walk, sit and pose in a partial fetal position with his feet well pointed. Congratulations, John, you can still point your feet very well! Yes, there are moments when we are reminded that the people on stage are actually talented dancers. There actually are some fleeting, brief moments of movements we may call dancing, but they are brief and punctuated by very, very, long periods of very, very boring stretches of walking, staring(longingly!), and carrying. One of the more interesting moments is a pas de deux of a man and woman each wearing one pointe shoe with the other foot bare. Is this brilliance, or just a gimmick? In any case, it is, of course, brief, since Neumeier doesn't want to divert too much of our attention away from the staring(longingly!).
To make matters worse, Neumeier has the nerve to comment that this is the most perfect possible choreographic approach to this subject! Could he be just a bit too self-absorbed with this?
Well, this is a very long ballet consisting of three discs, so we might think we are getting our money's worth. But is more of less more, or is it less? Hmmm, I think the latter.
Neumeier evidently feels very strongly toward the topic of this ballet. That is understandable. But if his emotions are so great that they prevent him from thinking clearly about the practical matters to bring it to the stage, then he should have let someone else tackle it.
Fortunately, we see from his subsequent work that this ballet is an aberration. John Neumeier is not washed up.
There are two types of artists: the kind that feels they work to please the audience, and the kind that feels the audience is there to please them. Hopefully, John will try to be more of the former and not the latter.",1322697600,2,2332,4.760493827160494
8407869,5,B003X8596Q,"This work is absolutely amazing, astounding and unbelievable.  I am German and have been a professional dancer myself, so the very high Quality of John Neumeiers ballets is not exactly new to me. Even so I was simply thunderstruck.  I could talk about intelligent, surprising choreographie or perfect dance technique, but after watching the ballet things like that somehow don't seem to be important anymore. For the first time in decades ballet has become again what it was meant for: just a means to transport something much bigger and greater than humanity itself. The mystery. Holyness. I am not even Christian and can feel now what it means to really sense his spirit inside oneself.  I put the first CD in and simply couldn't stop watching, following this profound mystery that unwrapped itself right in front of my eyes and also deeply perceptible in every one of my cells.  This definitely is what art was made for.  And I for myself was very content with Neumeiers decision to dance the part of Jesus, because it needs more than the life experience of a 25-year-old dancer to transport what Neumeier expresses here. He shows us a myth that is 100 percent christian but at the same time much, much older than Christianity - a truth that emcompasses not only the story of one man who lived 2000 years ago, but also of humanity itself and of every single person (and especially man) who watches this ballet today.  You can't get better, deeper and more encompassing than this.",1287705600,7,1482,4.76953125
8407870,1,B003X8596Q,"Choreographer John Neumeier's ST MATTHEW PASSION is a ballet I first saw and admired in Hamburg in 1981 and although memory can be a fickle thing and personal tastes change, I am surprised by just how disappointing I find this filmed performance made in 2005. Neumeier's vocabulary is opaque, its voice mute and in a work of over 200 minutes, few images remain in the mind and even fewer passages make any kind of articulate or expressive impact. And the presence of Neumeier himself in the cast does the ballet a disservice, his generational distance from the rest of the dancers triggering uncomfortable emotional, dramatic and contextual resonances while the ordinariness of his presence and performance make it a casting decision hard to understand. If you're looking for a ballet to a great piece of sacred music, try Uwe Scholze's GREAT MASS for the Leipzig Ballet - by no means a masterpiece but is has a structure and dramatic impetus that the self-important ST MATTHEW PASSION does not begin to achieve.",1285977600,9,1012,4.923976608187134
