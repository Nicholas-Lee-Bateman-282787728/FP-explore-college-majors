8226405,5,B000X1DH74,"IT WAS A RARE DOCUMENTARY TO LOOK AT THE BRUTALITY OF Japanese military in WW II Asia.  Japan after Meiji Restoration waged aggressive War on China in 1894 and 1931, ten years later, Pearl Harbor.  They earned the title ""Japanese Devil"" for hurt, oppression, torment, torture, violation, rape, dismember, murder, kill, burn and loot.  The film gave a comprehensive summary on events on Asian cities.

 The interviews on American POWs who survived the Bataan Death March, Hell Ship and slave labor in Japanese mines revealed how Americans had the will in enduring the pain and suffering ( Lester Tenny had leg and nose broken while Frank Bigalow had his leg saw off without anesthesia ) to come back to expose Japanese war crimes and atrocities against humanity.  These old soldiers testified in their own words and story in tears - no papa, no mama and no Uncle Sam.

 This film showed the Tokyo Trial with the Japanese Class A war criminals convicted and executed.  They were, however, secretly placed in Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo as national heroes with annual worship by Japanese Prime Ministers and die-hard soldiers who want to resurrect militarism.  It is equivalent of honoring Hitler in the biggest Cathedral in Berlin.

This Lou Reda production is a good educational history material for the younger generation to learn about the sacrifice of the American Greatest Generation in the fight for freedom and peace we all enjoy now.",1210377600,5,1436,4.96652719665272
