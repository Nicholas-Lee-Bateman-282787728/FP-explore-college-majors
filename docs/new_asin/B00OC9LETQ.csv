 The show Castle is a TV show on the ABC channel. It is a mysterious, funny and romantic show. The show is about a writer named Richard Castle played by Nathen Fillion and detective named Kate Beckett played by Stana Katic. The two of them in this show team up, and fight crime while they fall in love with the each other. The characters partnership, is the key to how they fight crime.
This show will get you laughing and is a great of the edge story about their daily lives.  If you like shows like CSI, Bones and Criminal Minds, you will definitely like this show. Over all I do recommended this show. I absolutely love this show and I rate this 5 out of 5 stars.",1449619200,,678,4.24031007751938

6735462,5,B00OC9LETQ,Love the Castle series. I wanted my own copy of all episodes. The main character interaction is fun and playful. I appreciate that the show is funny but complex. It is hard to predict who dunnit in these whodunnits.,1447027200,,215,4.538461538461538

6735468,3,B00OC9LETQ,"These were advertised as ""Used, like new"", but were actually copied DVD Roms. Well made with packaging that looked authentic, for the most it was hard to tell they weren't copies. However, we use our Playstation 4 to watch discs of all kinds, and all these show up on the PS menu as ""DVDRom"". Which only DVDRoms ever have in the past. Because it was at such a great price and we didn't have any major problems with them, we didn't make a fuss. And they may well have been ""used"" and ""like new"". But they were still copies.",1442016000,,522,4.282828282828283

6735473,1,B00OC9LETQ,"I purchased a six season pack of the TV show, ""Castle,"" from an Amazon third party merchant.  DO NOT buy from this merchant!  All of the seasons appeared to be, poor quality, burned copies, NOT legitimately, brand new product.  Plus, HALF of the seasons had defective discs that wouldn't play at all!  (They were all brand new, out of the box, too!  I tried to view them on multiple DVD players, which only confirmed the discs were defective).  Steer clear of this merchant!  Instead, buy each season separately, direct from Amazon.  Their DVD quality is exactly what brand new product should be.",1439683200,,596,4.7745098039215685
6735474,2,B00OC9LETQ,My order of this six season pack was a bit off. I received two season four discs and season five was not included in the order. I was unable to get a response from the seller about this issue so I ended up just ordering another season five. However the discs were all new and good quality.,1439424000,,289,4.087719298245614
6735475,5,B00OC9LETQ,"Purchased used through a high rated Amazon seller; the set arrived quickly, and appeared to be new!  Had caught a few episodes here and there, and really wanted to watch the series from the beginning.  So far, I'm not disappointed!  Highly improbable premise, but fun none-the-less.",1439078400,,282,5.086956521739131
6735476,3,B00OC9LETQ,"While who doesn't love 6 seasons of castle all at once, the quality of the dvds was inconsistent resulting in several shows actually skipping to the end of the show and/or throwing the sound out of sync if you tried to stop and restart, or reverse a scent.  There is at least one dvd in each with this issue.  So, being as it's Castle - you earned 3 points, quality of DVD awful.",1438819200,,379,4.178082191780822

6735481,3,B00OC9LETQ,"Super excited to receive these and the first two seasons are perfect without a hitch! Unfortunately, the 3rd season was ""dirty"" and unable to play on my DVD. I wasn't able to watch disc 1,3, or 5 which made the season hard to understand. However season 4 has yet to give me the same problem, so fingers crossed for the rest",1436227200,,323,4.311475409836065

Witty, suspenseful, police work with an adventurous ""ruggedly handsome"" mystery writer thrown in the mix.

6735485,1,B00OC9LETQ,"this product is excellent if you are willing to pay the full price to view each disc only once. the initial viewing went well, but every subsequent viewing of every disc was flawed.  the flaws included skips, lost audio, sudden stops without restarts, starting of episode in middle instead of beginning.  Definitely not worth the investment of time, money, or frustration!",1433462400,10,372,5.081967213114754

6735487,5,B00OC9LETQ,"I came to the Castle party late, so, I've been binge watching like crazy and these episodes don't disapppoint!!  I've been a Nathan Fillion fan since his portrayal of Joey on One Life to Live and with Castle he has hit his stride.  Now add Stana's performances from early Beckett to current-day Beckett and I can't get enough.  I'm obsessed and that hasn't happened to me in a long time with any series.  Looking forward to the fall and season 8 I can only imagine what's in store for us diehards.  Bravo cast-- this show is everything I ever expected and more!!!! Keep'em coming and ABC listen to this fervent fan base -- Caskett for ever.  #Can'tGetEnough, #Warm&FuzzyCastleFeelingEverytimeIWatch",1433289600,2,698,4.872881355932203

6735489,1,B00OC9LETQ,"*EDIT* I've gotten up to season 5 and I've had 2 disks that had chunks of episodes missing due to damage.  4 of them could not play altogether.  Don't purchase from this discount seller!

Firstly, I emphasize that the show itself is very enjoyable and the DVD content is fine.  This review is specifically for this 6 season bundle.  I was disappointed that this six pack was simply all the individual seasons duct taped and heat wrapped together, and not an actual released 6 pack from ABC. All the disks look like they've been thoroughly used but of the disks I've tried so far, they somehow miraculously work.  Some of disk insert hinges inside the case are broken, so the inserts fall out instead of swinging like they should.  That said, the product appears to be in the original wrapping, so the only conclusion I can come up with is the seller has significantly mis-handled said product.  Judging from other reviews, I am definitely not the first to have this problem.  I strongly suggest purchasing the individual seasons separately through Amazon rather than going through this seller.  The price is about the same per season and you'll probably have better odds of getting them in good condition.",1431302400,14,1205,4.777777777777778

6735492,2,B00OC9LETQ,"I love the show, but the fourth or fifth season had DVD's that did not work, so I had to return the entire set.  I ended up buying them individually because the second set I received had the same issue as the first.

6735494,1,B00OC9LETQ,"These were new. During playback Seasons 3, 4, 5 have some unreadable DVD's.  Playback ""hangs""/stops.  Inspected the DVD's and there are several large scratch spots on them - all are at the same angular displacement from the center and from the outer edge.  I'd started viewing at Season 3. In Season 5, I stopped and checked all of the six season packages.  Each of the six packages had large scratch marks on 4-5 of the DVD's in the package.  Still within the return period, so I am returning them.",1426377600,9,499,4.561797752808989
