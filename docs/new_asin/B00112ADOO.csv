8472788,5,B00112ADOO,This DVD has helped me tremendously in my recovery from surgery.  The stretches teach you how to focus on alignment and become aware of habits.  I  notice a big difference in my body on the days that I do the DVD.,1420934400,,213,4.146341463414634

8472790,5,B00112ADOO,"Chosen as his successor by the legendary Louis Schultz, an original disciple of Ira Rolf, herself, Marcello Coutinho is certainly one of the world's most prominent (and probably the best in the area of movement) practitioners of Structural Integration (more succinctly known as ""rolfing""). He is widely esteemed as a clinician-therapist, speaker and mentor. This DVD represents a cornerstone work that infuses stretches and movement routines with principles and approach of rolfing, a therapeutic modality that loosens and heals the myofascial system in order to effect and accelerate recovery from injury. As a physician interested in the musculoskeletal system, I found the techniques described on this DVD invaluable and have gifted this DVD to friends and family. Personally, I have been the benefactor of rolfing. Disabled and in severe chronic pain after an injury, I gained no benefit (and in some cases incurred further impairment) from physical therapy (in several institutions), medications provided by a ""who's-who"" roster of NYC specialists, alternative modalities (myosfascial release, Tai-chi, Shiatsu - you name it!) and eventually surgery at the number-two rated orthopedics hospital in the country. But my road to recovery started only with the first rolfing session and eventuated in my joining a Latin dance performance company! The stretches and movement routines described in this DVD further improved my posture, balance, flexibility and joint coordination. My neck length returned. So did my range of motion in all joints. My kyphosis disappeared. Painful areas healed one by one.  The DVD contains numerous pearls and detailed instruction on how to get the most benefit out of each maneuver. Pay close attention to the technique and advice provided. It is a great tool to prevent injury and maintain function. This work is a treasure, a major contribution to the area of  musculoskeletal health, and precious investment that will reap incalculable benefits and promote well-being for a life-time.",1218240000,10,2020,5.491961414790997
