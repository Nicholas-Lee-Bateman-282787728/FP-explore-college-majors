There is one guy who is dating three women.  Monday, Wednesday and Friday episodes follow each of the women and their dates with our main character.  The viewing audience determines how this story will unfold and which girl will capture his heart.  It's a different direction for a movie to take, but the characters are all very weird and funny, and you just never know where the story is going to go.  I didn't like the movie that they put together...it seemed to lose the charm from the daily episodes.  It's the wackiest sex romp you have seen in this genre.",1398816000,,723,4.473282442748092
8159276,4,B000KWZ1RU,Fairly entertaining if a little odd in places.  Not a family movie in my opinion.  Can't help but like the main character.,1395619200,,122,4.5
8159277,4,B000KWZ1RU,This product is awesome!  I loved the webisodes.  But having the DVD is just priceless!!!  Thank you so much!  Too bad it's over.  Will there be a sequel?,1175385600,,154,4.357142857142857
8159278,4,B000KWZ1RU,"Initially, I didn't know what to think considering I wasn't familiar with many of the actors on the DVD cover.  But I was pleasantly surprised from all of the leads, especially Jon Crowley as Brandon.  He was extremely humorous but at the same time sympathetic.  It was like watching a few of the guys talk about their weekend dates together.  A few of the minor parts seemed a bit rehearsed, but it never overshadowed the strength of the leads.  This isn't a big studio production, but it doesn't pretend to be.  The directing is strong, and the dialogue is well written.  It was especially nice to see familiar sections of Los Angeles as the backdrop.

I think the Webisodes sort of work better than the movie itself (especially in the middle where it seemingly cuts from one date to the next with some continuity problems).  Fortunately, they come nicely packaged on a separate DVD if you prefer the original internet version.  Alternatively, the full length movie adds a few extra scenes and goes with a more mature rating.  Both versions compliment each other nicely.

Overall, the story is charming and the actors pull it together in a very believable fashion.  I'd recommend this DVD.",1172448000,2,1191,4.779411764705882
