1852735,4,B00008MTYD,"let me start by saying that i am a fan of prison movies, and shows etc. such as Oz, The Rock.. this is the first movie that i have seen that actually bothered me. this film had a very gritty view of the life behind bars, enough to make you never want to get into trouble. it captured all aspects from having to separate from your friends in order to keep your own life in tect, to how the not so strong are savagely taken advantage of and forced to do against their will. i think this is a must see, but it will touch you.. peace...",1076976000,2,532,3.9813084112149535

I always tell my son, that by being with the wrong crowd or being in the wrong place at the wrong time can get you in a world of trouble and this movie just backed me up to the fullest. The movie is a must see for older teens and adults alike. It will definately make you think twice about wanting to be a thug or having a ""go-hard"" attitude.

1852774,3,B00008MTYD,"I purchased this movie as Its not available in Australia on blu ray and my local video store no longer had it on DVD.

That being said, the movie itself is good jail movie with the typical violence and another reminder not to end up there lol.

It was a great movie when I first saw it but like many movies when you watch it again you kinda don't get same rush you did initially.

However, for the price, it's worth the buy and I certainly would watch it again with my pal's that have not seen it.

Those that have not seen it, and like movies like blood in blood out (the best to date) , American me, colour's etc will enjoy it whilst being disturbed in some parts. Lol.

Blu ray quality was good for the age of original film. Very clear on my projector.

Sound, well, don't expect anything like saving pte Ryan, transformers, tron etc...

It's more dialogue.

Hope this helps",1362441600,,877,4.2727272727272725

While watching the movie I was totally disturbed by a lot of the scenes. I did realize before purchasing that it's a ""jail"" movie so I expected to see some disturbing scenes but this takes the cake!! I was so disturbed by this movie it just gave me a weird feeling for days after seeing it.
I do think that child and teenage boys need to see this movie as something like a ""scared straight"" tactic so they'll know what jail is REALLY LIKE and maybe they'll try to stay out of there!
Personally I can't stand this movie but some of you may not have a problem watching it if you don't mind the ""hard core"" rape scenes! I think that's what did it for me!",1278633600,2,798,4.089171974522293

1852785,3,B00008MTYD,"A friend told me about Lock Down years ago, but I never wanted to see it because of the contents that were described in it. Last night I decided to check it out and I have to say this movie is VERY disturbing. It was heartbreaking to watch a man have his manhood snatched away the way D'aundre Bonds did. It's already sad enough that many men are gay or are on the down low, let alone knowing that if he goes to prison and is not up on game the moment he steps into his cell, he can be taken just like that. There weren't any happy moments in this movie,and I couldn't believe the impact that it had on me my mood. I went from cool and calm to anger and depression. watching the way Avery and D'aundra went down all because of their ""boy"" reminded me of why I try to be careful of the company that I keep. This movie is no joke, I'm glad I finally sat down and watched it but apart of me wishes that I hadn't. This movie will NOT be on my list of must haves.",1180137600,,958,3.917948717948718
1852786,3,B00008MTYD,"This movie made me physically ill. Seriously, I felt like puking. Then again, what can you expect from a prison drama. This movie is definitely not easy to watch, and it's definitely not for someone squeamish or overly sensitive. Frankly, this is one of the most depressing movies of all time (as with most prison dramas). It's extremely rare to find any of them that end on a good note. I mean, they all pretty much end in death, destruction, rioting, and murder by shankings. With that being said, I've definitely seen worse. For those viewers who haven't heard ""American Me"" with Edward James Olmos is 10 times worse with the graphic scenes. There's also ""Blood In Blood Out/Bound By Honor"" which is closely related to ""American Me"" and that's also pretty graphic. Of course, that's an opinion though. I also find it very strange that hetrosexual men no longer think that sex with another man is so nasty once they go to prison. Then again, I guess that brings us back to rape being about power, and not about sexual pleasure. Personally, I think these people who get off on this are sick monsters who should be put to sleep like rabid bloodthirsty cannines. I think this movie just goes to show that a person can think their the toughest person in the world, but you never know how tough you really are until your manhood gets tested by someone tougher than you are, and how weakness is taken advantage of.",1175558400,,1410,4.599206349206349
1852787,2,B00008MTYD,"This film comes up short in casting, believability, editing (it's too long) and resolution.  It's a story that's been done repeatedly, and follows every possible stereotype. Even Richard T. Jones can't carry this movie.

Black man and friends (one ""good,"" one ""bad"") wrongfully accused of murder and sent to a maximum security prison where... every possible prison storyline happens.  Without much feeling or anything much to be interested in.

It's predictable, poorly paced, and ends with a dull thud of staged and fake feeling redemption.  I'd avoid this; there are certainly much better prison movies than this.",1167177600,4,615,5.298969072164948
1852788,5,B00008MTYD,This movie shows how you can be so inocent and still end up in hell. Richard T Jones gives a great performance as Avery who's life is off to great start until he finds himself and two of his freinds on lockdown. Prison life ain't no joke as one of Avery freinds is brutalized repeatly on the inside and even as he gets revenge his life is still loss. Hats off to Master P. who finally gave a great performance as the prison yard heavy. Show this movie to your teenagers let them see how doing absolutley nothing can get you thrown to the sharks and wolves of the world where only the strong survive and the weak only get abused.,1155513600,2,628,4.198347107438017
1852789,3,B00008MTYD,"This was not a bad movie. Seeing Master P on the cover made it hard to rent this movie but it was pretty entertaining. Although only half of scenes in this movie were believable. First of all, it was a little hard to fathom the fact that Avery (Richard T. Jones) was an avid swimmer and was pursuing it as a career, but on the other hand it was good to see because it is different than the typical story of the brotha using football or basketball as an avenue to get out of the hood. Second, the way they ended up in jail had to be the worse timing in history, the worse judgment made by a dude in the back seat in history, the worse timing by a dumb dog in history and the worse reaction by anyone who owned a dumb dog that got shot by a cop. The way they went to jail just made them look pretty dumb and made me cringe. And for the people with weak stomachs, there might be some material in here that might make you look away, like the male on male sex abuse, and the shankings were pretty graphic. Other than that, it was entertaining, somewhat realistic movie and the acting was pretty good even Percy Miller wasn't bad. Oh, Can't for get ya boy Clifton Powell, he was outstanding in this one, but heck that's no surprise!!!",1141344000,8,1228,4.142259414225942
1852790,4,B00008MTYD,"My brother put my on to this movie. Considering the fact that I don't really care for no limit films...thats pretty amazing. Anyway, I was honestly shocked at how good this flick was. Great acting? good script?...sorry, I'm still bugging over the whole no limit film thing. Damn good movie. But this seriously is not for those with weak stomach. It's probably as realistic as the mpaa would allow a movie to be without branding it with the dreaded nc-17 rating. Unfortunately, I've seen stuff like this with my own eyes so this movie kind of f'd me up a little bit. But don't be turned off by it's graphic nature.

1852792,5,B00008MTYD,This was a great movie. I found it to be very disturbing due to obvious discrimination at the jail.

Its really sad to know that De'aundre Bonds (the man who gets raped) is actually in prison for 11 years which I found extra-ly disturbing. but anyway, this film is amazing, i'm so into prison films now but its really disturbing to think that this actually exists in prisons...but oh well, its a lesson, if u ever go prison, this is the kinda ish u'll be facing!",1102723200,2,602,4.532110091743119

True, it was brutal and gave a side of prison life that you would not wish on your worst enemy.  What I enjoyed about it was the cast and the unique storyline, something that is usually not found in this type of film.  I originally saw a screening of the film at the American Black Film Festival in Miami a few years ago and was equally as captivated with it when I saw it again on DVD.  I would suggest this film for those who want a peek into the hard reality that so many live every day.",1101600000,5,587,3.8666666666666667
