2707869,5,B000LE16VM,"I have always loved this show and truly enjoyed the great chemistry between Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari! They were just hilarious dressed as women and equally as funny as Kip and Henry! I really love it when men  dress and act the way they percieve women to be, especially when they're really good at it. Some perfect examples, Dustin Hoffman in Tootsie, Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes in To Wong Foo, Thanks for everything Julie Newmar, and Eddie Murphy, ect.

When I read some of the other reviews regarding the issue over whether or not the original theme song will be included, it didn't matter until I purchased the first season of Baretta and the theme song Eye on the Sparrow was the instrumental version and not the original vocal sung by Sammy Davis Jr., I was really disappointed!!! I wish I had a better understanding of the issues of music rights, because it's a real problem with alot of older shows getting released with the original music. I know that's the hold up with The Wonder Years taking so long to make it on dvd.",1170288000,3,1038,4.545454545454546
2707870,2,B000LE16VM,"I remember liking this series when I was a freshman in high school, it debuting in November 1980. My younger brother also liked it, and Tom Hanks had a lot to do with why we enjoyed it. Hanks was a very funny guy when it came to late 70s-early 80s TV. The show is a bit worse for wear, though (not to mention that stupid Billy Joel theme). I'm not sure how well Hanks' schtick holds up now, except it doesn't work @ awards ceremonies. First of all, did anyone see him give Warren Beatty an honorary award @ this year's Golden Globes(""The man has balls!""-sheer brilliance when it comes to giving speeches, right?) or his extremely obnoxious, unfunny comic hosting of overhyped Ron Howard's tribute a couple of years ago? What about those looonnnggg extreme acceptance speeches he made at the Oscars the two times he won the award, one for a film where his costar Denzel Washington really deserved the award more (""Philadelphia"") and the other for his lame-brained backwards schtick as ""Forrest Gump"", losing Paul Newman the award he really should have won for ""Nobody's Fool"". Hank's filmography is about as elevated and interesting as one of his film's scripts: ""Punchline"", ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"", ""A League of Their Own"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""Cast Away"", ""Road to Perdition"", ""The DaVinci Code"". Someone mentions here that Hanks, like Spencer Tracy, won those two Oscars back to back. Okay, given, but the difference here is that Tracy was a natural where Hanks is a sitcom actor. You didn't see Tracy doing the likes of ""Dragnet"", ""Big"", or ""Turner and Hooch"", or, at his heigth, appearing in things such as ""You've Got Mail"". Of recent, though, Hanks has appeared to accept his true role for what it should be, in films such as the remake of ""The Ladykillers"" and ""The Polar Express"". He's also had some breaks, too, with roles such as the concerned commander, raising one eyebrow, in ""Apollo 13"", or the officer who, while ""Saving Private Ryan"", laughs at how Ryan mistreats an unfortunate girl. I watched ""Bosom Buddies"" because it followed ""Mork & Mindy"" and was up against the far-too-long run of ""The Waltons"". Ironically, though, it was ""Barney Miller"" that followed, and was probably the best thing on TV @ the time...but I was only 15, so...",1169769600,2,2264,4.778061224489796
2707871,5,B000LE16VM,"Sure, the storyline had been done before in ""Some Like it Hot"", but I really loved this show. The obvious reason for looking back on it now is to see Tom Hanks ""back in the day"" before he hit the big screen. After all, he was the only actor besides Spencer Tracy to ever win back-to-back Best Actor Oscars. Wouldn't you be curious if we had 40 or so half-hour episodes of Spence as a young man parading around in a dress in a situation comedy? I know I would. Besides Tom Hanks, the other castmembers were terrific, and most had pretty good careers. Peter Scolari (Henry Desmond) had a long run on ""Newhart"" in the 80's, Donna Dixon (Sonny Lumet) was adequate enough as Hank's love interest on the show, the late Wendy Jo Sperber (Amy Cassidy) was very good as the overweight girl who hoped against hope that Scolari's character would come to love her, and finally there's the early appearance of Telma Hopkins (Isabelle Hammond) who had other comedic roles on ""Gimme A Break"" and then ""Family Matters"". There were 19 episodes in the first season, even though it didn't debut until late November 1980:

Pilot"" - Kip and Henry dress up as women so that they can live in a hotel that is restricted to women.

""My Brother, My Sister, Myself"" - Kip is discovered in Hildy's room, which is strictly against hotel rules.

""Loathe They Neighbor"" - After an argument with Amy, Sonny moves in with Buffy and Hildy.

""Macho Man"" - Henry becomes a macho man when their masquerade has him doubting his masculinity.

""What Price Glory?"" - Kip and Henry try to get the account of the unscrupulous Dr. Bob without losing their self-respect.

""Kip and Sonny's Date"" - Kip blows his first date with Sonny.

""Beauty and the Beasts"" - Kip and Henry go to a singles bar as Buffy and Hildy and are not picked up by guys.

""Revenge"" - A date who dumped Amy has a very bad practical joke played on him.

""Amy's Career"" - Amy is put in charge of a mouthwash advertising campaign and totally blows it.

""Gotta Dance"" - Kip has to tell Sonny that a spot in a commercial he arranged for her has been given to another girl.

""Sonny Boy"" - Hildy and Buffy stop a robbery and make the TV news, which prompts Henry's mother to pay `him' a visit.

""How Great Thou Art"" - Henry arranges for some of Kip's paintings to be displayed at a gallery as a birthday surprise.

""Kip Quits"" - When a client wants a campaign run his way, Henry conforms but Kip quits to sell hot dogs in the park.

""Only the Lonely"" - Ruth invites Kip and Henry over for dinner, then will not let them leave.

""The Re-Write"" -Kip asks Henry to spice up his autobiography.

""The Show Must Go On"" - Kip and Henry wash dishes at a night club so that Isabelle can sing there.

""The Hospital"" - Buffy and Hildy become hospital candy stripers so Kip can be closer to Sonny.

""Best Friends"" - Henry feels left out when Kip renews his friendship with a rock and roll star.

""Cahoots"" - Kip and Amy team up to advance their respective romances with Sonny and Henry but the efforts backfire.

It isn't until the second season that Sonny learns the truth about Buffy and Hildy actually being Kip and Henry. As for the rumor about the theme song on the DVD not being sung by Billy Joel, or possibly not even being the original ""My Life"", I don't know, but I can believe it might be true. I bought a DVD set of ""Bonanza"" recently, and the original theme song and background music had been replaced by music that sounded like it had been cranked out by some teenager in his garage on a synthesizer. This all has to do with contracts that made provisions for copyrighted music in syndication, but not such avenues as DVD since the medium didn't even exist at the time.",1167696000,11,3692,4.385630498533724

2707896,3,B000LE16VM,"I just recently purchased this item and one thing I noticed right off that I found very disappointing was that the theme song was not the original and I knew right away it was something copyright related.  I think its a shame that these companies are so cheap and don't strive to bring out a product that any true fan of this show or any other show where they do this editing crap could enjoy to its fullest.  How hard would it have been to get copyrights for one freakin song??  Copyrighting really ruins it for season dvds.  One show in particular won't even be released for copyright reasons, the Wonder Years, pathetic.",1331510400,2,623,4.486725663716814

2707899,5,B000LE16VM,"Yep, I am NOT afraid to admit I have always loved this show.

Silly, a cheesy story line.

But, it was funny.

Of course, the beginning of Hanks career.

For then future TV references the makers of the show were the makers of ""Full House"".
You can see that in episode ""The Show Must Go On"".  Gee whiz, we see Bob Saget as ""Bob the Comic"".
You will note any ""Full House"" fans in the episode where Danny & Joey go back to college in a prank they are dress just like Tom & Peter wore.  Cue the wardrobe department, same dresses?

This season we had two managers of ""The Susan B Anthony"".  Not to be seen again in season 2.

And, on the DVD, where is Billy Joel's ""My Life""?

I still remember scenes & can quote lines.  Episode one ""Macho Man"".

To me, just as funny today as when first aired.",1298592000,,789,4.084967320261438
2707900,5,B000LE16VM,"The first season of ""Bosom Buddies"" is the very best. Because everything is so fresh and comedic. There are a total of 19 eps from Season One. I got this set partly because I am a big fan of Wendie Jo Sperber. She was always so cute and funny. I loved her in ""Back To The Future."" Wendie Jo sorta reminded me of Mama Cass (and who doesn't love Mama Cass?) This show came out before I was born, but I have seen most of the reruns on TBS and I fell in love with it. If you've never seen ""Bosom Buddies"" before, it's a lot like ""Three's Company"" or ""Prefect Strangers"" but even better!",1193184000,6,582,4.069565217391304
2707901,4,B000LE16VM,"This is my favorite TV show ever. I have every episode on video tape. I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD so I can have every episode recorded on the pureness of digital and with no scenes cut out. So it's terribly disappointing to be missing the theme song, and it's also missing some jokes that require songs, too. In one scene, Kip goes into the bathroom and you're supposed to hear him singing ""Happy Days Are Here Again..."" but you don't hear anything. In another scene, Isabelle's date is honking the horn for her outside and we're supposed to hear the horn playing ""Dixie"" or something, but we just hear a regular horn. The audience laughs, but what are they laughing at? Something we no longer hear on the DVD. I'm not going to buy this DVD set until all this is fixed!",1190419200,6,785,4.346938775510204
2707902,3,B000LE16VM,"Although I'm glad I bought this first season package of ""Bosom Buddies"", I am a little disappointed that it's not quite as I remember.  Firstly, the opening theme song is not ""My Life"" by Billy Joel.  It's something else entirely.  Also, one of my favorite episodes (where Kip and Henry go to Ruth's apartment) was not complete.  The part where they're all singing the Calypso song is not in it.  That scene was hilarious.  Makes me wonder how many episodes they have chopped up.  I guess, in the long run, it's better to have some of Bosom Buddies as opposed to none of them.",1189468800,4,576,4.480769230769231
2707903,5,B000LE16VM,"Thank GOD Tom Hanks became a huge star after this show went off the air, because otherwise it would probably have never been seen again.  BOSUM BUDDIES was a terrific little tv show that struggled for two years to find an audience again such powerhouse fare as MAGNUM PI, and was largely ignored by the critics because of it's ""jiggle tv"" premise.

But there's no denying the talent and chemistry of the actors, nor the high quality of the writing.  And as dated as the production values are now, the series holds up tremendously.  It's a shame the studio wasn't able to clear the original theme song, and wasn't willing to pony up for any bonus materials, but don't let that stop you - see BOSUM BUDDIES.",1183852800,,705,4.52755905511811
2707904,5,B000LE16VM,"I remember this comedy well growing up - it was one of my favorite TV
sit coms and a young up and coming Tom Hanks.  If you refuse to buy the
series because they replaced the Billy Joel opening theme song that only
lasted a minute or so - that is so SILLY, no really SO SILLY. Grow up.
The Busom Buddy series is great entertainment, and it's not Billy Joels
song that made it popular.",1183766400,,384,4.052631578947368
2707905,4,B000LE16VM,"The show Bosom Buddies was one of my favorites when it was on TV and I of course got it when it came out on DVD.Much to my surprise and dismay though, they had changed the music at the beginning to some horrible piece of garbage instead of the wonderful MY LIFE by Billy Joel. I was really disappointed in this as I love that song and actually had heard it for the first time on the show. If you get this DVD set just fast forward through the credits and go on to the quality part of the DVD the show itself.",1181606400,,508,3.941747572815534
2707906,2,B000LE16VM,"I had hoped that the original music played during the opening of the show would also be on the DVD.  Sadly, it was replaced by a cheezy song that begs to hit fast forward on the remote!",1179187200,4,185,4.0
2707907,4,B000LE16VM,"I remember watching this show first run.  All the episodes I remember from childhood are there.  The urban cowboy, the first date with Sonny, and the Amy revenge episode.  Some dialog I remember clearly after not seeing the show for many years- decades.  I just finished the second disc and will be moving on to the third.  I was disappointed by the ""replaced"" opening theme until I realized the tune is the same tune that appears over the ending credits and some music cues.  Interesting!  So I will ding my review to four stars.  We're even.  When I watched them first run, it was deep into the first season before they added the pretitle sequece explaining the show.  I believe it was added to the network reruns of the early episodes too.  Sure enough, the last two episodes on the second disc contain the pre title sequence.  I am amazed at how clean the humor of the show is compared to the humor of modern shows.  I can almost let my seven year old watch these, almost.

At the end of the day, if you can stomach not having the ""My Life"" theme song and loved this show in the past, just get it and enjoy.  You can easily bypass the opening song by pressing the chapter skip button!",1176076800,3,1188,4.360730593607306
2707908,2,B000LE16VM,"I was one of the first people to order Bosom Buddies when it came out and ran home to play it, unfortunately I hear Stephanie Mills instead of the Billy Joel song. One of the things that made this show so great is the nostalgia it brings back watching the opening sequence. I personally only got through 3 episodes because I was so thrown off by the music in the opening. I loved this show and looked forward to seeing it, however I didn't think I would have to find out that the song which is great is not the right song on the dvd. I mean come on you wouldn't play Earth, Wind, and Fire to Different Strokes! How about Eye of the Tiger to the A-Team openin! I wouldn't recommend it for now, who knows maybe they may re-release it with the Billy Joel song if there's enough complaints......",1175990400,10,791,4.245033112582782
2707909,5,B000LE16VM,"I've got news for everybody.  I remember watching the series from the first episode when it first aired,  and the song ""MY LIFE""  was not the original theme song.  I'm not sure whether or not the original theme song was the song that they are now using, but I think it was, or at least the original theme song was very similar to this one.  ""My Life""  was used later, either part way through the first season, or not until the second season. I remember watching the show one day and thinking, ""That's interesting, they changed the theme song to a Billy Joel song"" Similarly, the voice over during the opening was also not used until part way through the first season, probably just the way it is on the DVD, because I also remember when they added that and thinking, ""I guess they needed to explain the premise for the people who missed the first episodes"".  So, just because you people have been watching the syndicated version for years, with the ""My Life"" theme and spoken intro apparently on all episodes, you might be surprised to discover that the opening of these shows as presented here is a lot closer to how they actually were broadcast, than you think.",1175990400,5,1163,4.5095238095238095
2707910,1,B000LE16VM,"I have been reading the reviews, having not yet purchased the product and I have officially changed my mind about buying it. Who's fault is this anyway? Billy Joel's? Paramount? Tom Hanks? This is ridiculous. Anyone who spends the money, should have the original product, complete, intact!

How many episodes of 'Friends' were edited? (Uh, none!) Original theme song, annoying as ever. I consider myself, a 'Bosom Buddies' expert! I actually purchased some 'pirated' copies from Canada (did not know this at the time) and I will stick with them, commercials and all, plus the original theme song. If they could use the Billy Joel song in reruns, they could put it on the videos. Oh, and the cover is absolutely horrible. Very disappointed and to repeat what others have  all ready said, shame, shame, NOT COOL!",1175817600,6,810,4.905109489051095
2707911,3,B000LE16VM,"I would have rated this 5 stars if it had the original theme song. True it is still funny without it, but the original always put me in a good mood.

2707912,5,B000LE16VM,"I was concerned when I read the shows were edited. I decided to compare the dvds to the shows broadcast on TBS in 2005. I have watched the 1st 5 episodes, and the dvds are definitely not edited. There were only 2 instances of music cut out and it was only in episode 3. Sonny decides to room with Kip and Henry. Tom Hanks runs into the closet and sings Happy Days are Here again. Its weird on the dvd to see sonny  and buffy react to the singing which isn't on the DVD.  In a later scene One of the girls is talking to Kip in the lobby before going on a date. The off screen sound effect is of a regular car horn, on the syndicated version the horn plays i wish i were in the land of cottton.  Also the syndicated version in many cases leave out the last scene before credits roll, these are on the DVD.SO short of Missing My LIfe or the Spoken introduction I can say the 1st five episodes are complete, and contain many scenes not in the 2005 syndicated versions I taped. I will check the remaining episodes and psot what I find  Ken",1175299200,4,1034,4.078817733990148

I was stunned when I started watching the first disc and the familiar and much-loved My Life theme song was missing, and that was one of my favorite parts of the show. And had I known that these were the edited syndication episodes and not the original, I would have passed on this set and waited for a better version. This show deserved better.",1175040000,6,403,4.315789473684211
2707924,1,B000LE16VM,"Billy Joel's 'My Life' song is cut because Paramount didn't or couldn't clear the rights and it's absence destroys the energy of the first 5-10 minutes of each episode. Also, scenes are cut. Travesty. It's such a good show, especially to gay guys who grew up on it, and it could have been so much better on DVD if they'd just spent some money on music and extras.",1174953600,6,363,4.352941176470588
2707925,3,B000LE16VM,"I  like Bosom Buddies when it was an 1980's show. You heard Billy Joel's My LIfe as tne theme song. A young Tom Hanks, a pre-Newhart Peter Scolari. Telma Hopkins, (The late great) Wendy Jo Sperber, Holland Taylor and Donna Dixon. It was ""Some Like It Hot"" in a boarding house. Hanks and Scolari sold us Kip (buffy) and Henry (hildy) to save money. It was two guys trying to woman for less rent. it was a cute, fun little show that was good for a few laughs

Now the DVD incarnation is not great. Some of the shows seemed over edited, as these were the syndicated shows and NOT the original masters. It is missing Billy Joel's My Life for some lame theme which does not work against the opening credits. There are NO extras to speak of and the stuff thats here is not up to quality

Paramount/CBS video should have known better. They should have spend a few extra dollars  and gone for the best (like Billy Joel's My Life), not like the Mama's Family (see the reviewe) [...] that Warner Brothers heaped upon us last year. Yes, It seems cut

It is worth it to see a young Tom Hanks, but PLEASE PARAMOUNT/CBS get us the real thing and not wash out, syndicated shows that seem cut to ribbons and my opinion destroyed, that why only 3 stars

2707926,1,B000LE16VM,"First - I love this show when it was on in the 80's.  I was looking forward in hering ""MY LIFE"" as the theme song to each episode.  I was beyond shocked to hear this lame horrible song they replaced the classic that Billy Joel sang.  The song was VERY much a part of the success of the show.  Im very very sorry to have bought this now.  I will have to think twice on any further DVDs from Paramount.  It is not like they don't have enough money to fix whatever contracts they may have needed to correct this.  Shame shame shame!!!!!!",1174176000,5,534,4.12621359223301
2707927,4,B000LE16VM,"This was a fun show in the early 80's.  It featured some of the best slapstip comedy and jokes based on popular commercials at the time.  I've often remarked that the show had some of the best writers pre-""Golden Girls"".

  But the real strength of the show lies in the fact that it's not like today's sitcoms, where the characters spend most of their time trying to belittle each other.  Rather, the show is all about personal relationships.

  Examples include: ""Beauty and the Beasts"": our ""bosom buddies"" (Kip and Henry) treat a woman like trash, then (under the cover of drag) are taken to a bar by the women of the hotel where they live, only to see the same thing from the other side; ""Only the Lonely"": Ruth, their boss, reaches out to them as she has sacrificed her own friendships to get where she is today; ""Revenge"": Kip, Henry, and the women of the hotel arrange a plot to get even with a man who was cruel to Amy; ""Kip Quits"": Kip learns that sometimes you have to swallow your pride in the workplace.  The last example also features one of my favorite commercial references: Henry: ""you asked for this so don't expect a peptalk from me"". Kip: ""ah, come on, Henry, be a pepper!"" Henry: ""and wouldn't you like me to be a pepper too!""  Classic and original.

  In all, the show is really much better than the recycled ""I Love Lucy"" plots found in contemporary sitcoms.",1174089600,2,1380,4.468

It wasn't even sung by Joel, it was a cover! How hard could it have been to pay for the right version? And this is Tom Hanks, doesn't he deserve better? I wish he had picked up the tab for a decent release of his own cult show!

The biggest problem is that there are no chapters in the episodes, so you're forced to listen to ""Can't Shake Me Loose"" over and over and over. A great show, and we waited YEARS for the release. Both it and the fans deserved better.",1173830400,5,643,3.9844961240310077
2707930,5,B000LE16VM,"I can go ahead & give this set a high rating in advance as ANYTHING has to be better than the SLP VHS tapes someone attempted to release about 10 years ago.  I think Tom Hanks put a halt to that at the time, might just be an urban legend, there were only four tapes issued.  As all of the other reviewers have stated, this was a fun show with a very unusual premise.  Outstanding cast. No matter how old I get or how many times I see Tom Hanks in a film, this is how I always remember him.  Same goes for Holland Taylor, she will always be ""Ruth Dunbar"" to me.  I have to admit I liked Peter Scolari more than Tom Hanks on the show.

Now, for the theme song!  YES, the rerecorded version of ""My Life"" was used for the opening credits when the show originally aired on network TV.  The closing credits featured an instrumental tune called ""Shake Me Loose"".  I didn't see the show again until it landed on USA Network in 1992 and at that point, a vocal version of ""Shake Me Loose"" has replaced ""My Life"" for the opening credits.  Even then, you could still here the first few notes of ""My Life"" as the opening monologue was giving way to the title sequence.

I just assumed it was a legal issue with the Billy Joel camp, as is usually the case with TV shows (see mindboggling reviews of ""In Living Color""'s DVD sets for very good examples of this).  Later, when ""Bosom Buddies"" turned up on TBS, ""My Life"" was BACK at the opening theme!  Seemed like a commercial collection release was in the works, but no such luck at that point.  There was reason to hope.  A similar thing happened with ""The Partridge Family"" when the original prints turned up on The Family Channel prior to the series reissue on collector's VHS (and later DVD), complete with all of the original season's openings, replacing the severely chopped & theme-song streamlined edits from years of syndication (still seems funny that song sequences were actually edited from that show!!).

""Shake Me Loose""'s lyrics were written by Chris Thompson, one of the show's creators.  The vocals are done by Stephanie Mills.  It has been speculated that this was supposed to be the theme from the very beginning, since the lyrics fit the premise, but perhaps the network tried a more ""familiar"" tune to attract an audience to a new show.  Rarely are such legalities profiled on DVD sets, but it would be nice if they told us what the real story is somehow with profiles & behind the scenes extras.

*post purchase update*...having said all of that, there are NO extras and they even went so far as to edit out the opening intro where Henry & Kip explain the premise of the show before each title theme sequence.  Not sure if anything else was edited, but other reviews indicate as much.  Might not retire those VHS tapes after all....and I should drop this rating down by at least one star!!",1172707200,3,2846,4.453667953667954
2707931,4,B000LE16VM,"Finally this terrific series has being released.  The great thing about Bossom Buddies is that the whole ""cross-dressing"" gimmic allowed it to get on the air in the first place but the show was so well written that, by the second season, it was rarely ever brought up (except for continuity sake). I was amazed at the chemistry that Hanks and Scolari had.  You would have thought that they had worked together for years before the series.
Also, a note to Tamra:  Baretta's first season theme was actually an instrumental version. The Sammy Davis Jr. vocal version had already been recorded for the first season but due to a decision by ABC, it was replaced.  I've heard it said that they didn't want a black performer singing the theme song.  When the show became a hit, Dave Grusin (or one of the composers) convinced ABC to use the Davis vocal version.",1172016000,2,854,4.629139072847682
2707932,4,B000LE16VM,"If you missed Bosom Buddies when it originally aired in the early 80's (or the few times that it has appeared in syndication) you have a great treat in store for you with this DVD release.

While some glowing reviews may claim that Bosom Buddies ranks among some of the ""greatest sitcoms"", I personally would not make such lofty claims. Bosom Buddies was a ""fun series"" with a great cast, but it never truly hit its stride in the writing department. This is one of the reasons it was cancelled after only two seasons.

If you're looking to feed your 80's nostalgia monster, this series will make a great snack! The novelty of watching a young Tom Hanks provides most of the calories, but one certainly cannot discount the rest of the cast...

The late Wendie Jo Sperber was an amazing comedic actress. Hollywood seemed to always cast her as the ""funny fat girl"" but that never stopped her true beauty and charm from shining through. I would highly recommend watching the movie ""I wanna hold your hand"" to see Wendy at the top of her form! Thanks Wendy, your fans will never forget your wonderful smile!

Peter Scolari was a great physical comedian who finally found success on the long running ""Newhart"" series. The rest of the cast was excellent, especially Lucille Benson and Donna Dixon.

The writing may falter at times, but the chemistry of Hanks and Scolari fills the void. That may not have been enough to save the series in its original TV run, but it's certainly enough to make me want to own the series on DVD :) I'm giving the series five stars. Three for the series itself and one star for ""nostalgia"" and another for ""novelty"".

Unfortunately, the series has been released in an ""EDITED"" form. ""True fans"" will NOT be happy;

The original theme song was a ""re-recorded"" version of the song ""my life"" written by Billy Joel. Another artist (not Billy Joel) performed the vocals. Removing this song from the DVD release basically RUINS the series in some respects.

Releasing EDITED versions of episodes is a HUGE mistake and a real ""deal killer"" for many fans. It also deprives new viewers of being able to experience the series as it was originally intended.

Peter Scolari went on to be a main cast member of the show Newhart, as well as guest apperances on a few sit-coms.

8161761,3,B000LE16VM,"The show gets five stars!  One of my favorite shows of the 1980's, and all-time, for that matter!  Tom Hanks got to show who he really was to become here.  His comic timing was impeccable, and his acting skills are truly showcased here.

The DVD though, gets three stars for a very typical reason - music rights.  This show didn't use a lot of original music, but when it did, it was nearly always essential to the plot.  This means some entire scenes have been edited out, which makes for a bit of confusion, especially for anyone who hasn't seen the original version.  So, for those particular episodes, we're getting the syndicated version, which I'm sure you know means a lot is missing and takes a lot away from these episodes.  Most of these instances they didn't actually use the music or the song, but the characters sang it themselves, and usually only a small portion of the song.  I think that an exception should be made for these instances, as far as music rights payments are concerned.  By that I mean, making the rights fees more reasonable, or allow for ""fair use"" in these instances.  On the other hand, I don't think the producers of this DVD even attempted to get the music rights.  They just cut the scenes out.  They even got rid of the original Billy Joel theme song, My Life, and replaced it with a simply horrid substitute song, which completely ruins the intro of the show.",1449187200,,1399,4.52589641434263

8161765,1,B000LE16VM,"This makes me sad. If you're reading this, then you're a fan of this show, as I am. I am so sick an tired of Hollywood production companies thinking they can just half ass their product to us and we'll be happy little sheep. I realize some of you may say, ""Hey, at least it's on DVD. Can't you just be happy?"" I'd love to, but if you watched this show like I did, that outstanding theme song really excited me for the show every time. It set the perfect tone for the humor this show delivered. And when they edit down scenes or remove songs from within the show for rights reasons, they destroy all the moments the show makers and actors crafted. I am tired of this, Hollywood. A very key and heartwarming moment in ""Quantum Leap"" was ruined by this same ""oh, we don't have the rights for that song so let's just dump in this song that doesn't fit"" issue. Enough!

I loved this show as I saw it, and if you refuse to reproduce those versions, then I pass. I know for a fact that when EVERY EPISODE starts and it has the wrong music, that will serve as a distraction and it will do the exact opposite of what I wrote before. That Billy Joel song was perfect. Can you imagine Happy Days without ""Happy Days"" or ""Friends"" without ""I'll be there for you"" or any other show you connect it's theme song too not having it's original theme song? Not this guy.

""Friends"" managed to release every episode on DVD uncut, some with extended scenes and NO music was replace in the whole series, that I noticed. Even if you stripped us of any bonus features (which may have made up for this issue) but gave us the original episodes as they appeared, we'd all be happy. So if we can't treat Tom Hanks and Peter Scolari's classic comedy with the respect it deserves, then don't do it. I doubt they will every change this release, so if you want this DVD set just have it, go for it. I'll have to pass.",1401321600,3,1885,4.233333333333333
