4947311,4,B0063NT8S8,I don't really like the action films of Charles Bronson but this movie is entirely different.  Jill Ireland was his real time wife and they are very cute together in this movie.  The music theme is also very pretty.,1359676800,2,215,4.487179487179487

4947313,5,B0063NT8S8,"I saw this film in the theatre on the tail-end of a double-bill with ""Westworld"" in 1976.  Most of the audience left after a while because this wasn't the Charles Bronson of ""Death Wish"" they were expecting.  It had a perfunctory first run release a few months earlier and disappeared quickly.  It came out in the Fall of 1976 but the film was copyrighted 1975.  Probably a case of a big studio, in this case United Artists, allowing a big star a vanity production with the proviso he make an audience pleasing blockbuster later.  Regardless, I stayed and liked it.  Unbeknownst to me I was probably a closet romantic at thirteen.  ""From Noon Till Three"" is a whimsical tall tale about a grounded two-bit bankrobber (Bronson) who has an afternoon tryst with a beautiful but stuffy widow(Jill Ireland).  After he departs and thinking he was shot dead by a posse the widow parlays her experiences of that day into a garden industry that includes a book, songs, sideshows, and stageplays.  Returning one year later, oddly enough after serving time for a crime he didn't commit, the bankrobber returns to the widow wanting to resume their affair.  She'll have none of it and will protect the world she created at any cost.  Director-writer Frank M. Gilroy expounds on the nature of storytelling and legend and how people embellish the truth because it just isn't romantic enough. The film is a breezy one and Bronson appears to be delighted to be appearing in lighter fare than the two-fisted action pictures he's usually cast in.  I think he also has a level of satisfaction playing opposite Ireland, his real life wife until her death, and Ireland relishes her oppotunities here by giving a terrific performance.  You can describe ""From Noon Till Three"" as a little film but in its unassuming way its themes are large.",1348790400,13,1816,4.782051282051282
8492144,5,B0063NT8S8,"Excellent movie.  I'm a real Bronson fan, and this is one of his most entertaining comedies.  Bronson is mostly noted for ""thrillers"" so this is a fun departure from his usual.",1517356800,,176,4.645161290322581
8492145,5,B0063NT8S8,"Not a big fan of Bronsons, and not really familiar with Jill Ireland's works, but I know they were married in real life. Saw this movie on tv way back in 1978 and fell in love with it! Best romantic/comedy/western ever! Music was wonderful!",1514851200,,240,4.4772727272727275
8492146,5,B0063NT8S8,"Growing up and hitting the movie theaters on my own in the seventies I grew up a fan of the then hot star Charles Bronson. DEATH WISH came out just about the time I was able to start driving on my own and with that film he began a string of hit movies that as a teen we all had to see. Bronson made a habit of starring his wife Jill Ireland in his films once he achieved enough clout, an excellent actress who did make a living on her own. But it was nice to see them on the screen together. Perhaps their best film together is the little known or seen FROM NOON TILL THREE.

Bronson stars as Graham Dorsey, part of an outlaw group intending to rob the local bank. With their horses tiring out, they stop at a remote house on the prairie owned by a widow named Amanda (Jill Ireland). There are only enough horses for part of the gang so Dorsey, uneasy at best about the planned robbery, volunteers to stay behind and keep an eye on Amanda with the gang returning once the job has been pulled off.

Over the next three hours Dorsey and Amanda get to know each other. Dorsey tries to be a gentleman but her attempts at escape leave him no choice but to find a way to make her stay. As they become acquainted Amanda falls for the charm that Dorsey displays and they end up in bed together. Its a case of love at first sight but eventually part of the gang returns. It seems the robbery went bad and most were killed. Now they head out, leaving Amanda behind.

In an attempt to disguise himself Dorsey poses as someone else. Unfortunately that man is wanted for fraud and he is taken off to jail. The man he switched identities with is killed and thus Amanda fears that Dorsey, the man she fell in love with, is now deceased.

What happens next is a comedy of errors. Amanda takes her romance to heart and pens a first-hand account of the events that took place. Embellishing is not the word for it as her tale turns from potential kidnapping to a romantic tryst with a notorious outlaw. The book is a major success and spawns both a play and a hit song about the events, From Noon Till Three.

The movie gets funnier still when Dorsey is finally released from prison, when he tries to return to Amanda andwell watch it to see what happens. The movie offers some truly hilarious moments and shows the Bronson had a knack for comedy that not many would have suspected. Ireland is tremendous in the role of Amanda.

True fans of Bronson will not want to miss this movie. It is by far one of his best in my book. Not only will you get to see how good of an actor he was youll have a lot of fun with this one as well. As with all Twilight Time releases this is limited in number so if you see it, order it today!",1497225600,,2704,4.160611854684513

*Plot and ending analyzed*

From Noon Til Three is a pretty lousy movie.  Not only is the acting not up to par, the script isn't that convincing.  It seems like a cross between a comedy and a play, with disastrous results.  Charles Bronson is annoying to watch, since he's a wooden actor, and if he's not in constant action, then he'll wear you down really quick.  He's not likeable at all here, switching his clothes with a dentist, who later gets shot by the posse who was after him.

Jill Ireland is his love interest.  Jill Ireland is wooden as well.  She sleeps with him right off the bat, why, I'm still trying to figure that out.  They have three hours before his gang comes back so they spend their time in bed, or near a pond, or in a parlor.  Sounds about as much fun as having sand poured over your head.  Jill Ireland thinks he gets shot and a book is written about their love romance, which becomes famous.  Charles Bronson was actually put into prison for a year and when he comes back, no one believes its him.  That's pretty much it.  It's not believable at all and makes for a long viewing because of the tedious scenes.

Charles Bronson was better in Breakheart Pass (1975) or The Magnificent Seven (1960).",1471996800,,1266,4.415584415584416
8492149,5,B0063NT8S8,"I love this movie.  I saw it many years ago and I have waited for years for it to come out on DVD.  This is Charles Bronson as you have never seen him before.  The story has a lot of humor in it, with a surprising and funny ending.  I have long recommended this film to other people.  You won't be disappointed (unless you're looking for a typical Bronson film).",1427068800,2,362,4.114285714285714
8492150,5,B0063NT8S8,FROM NOON TILL THREE is an entirely refreshing and unanticipated idiosyncratic Western full of sentimentalism from Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland. Knowing that Bronson and Ireland were man and wife in actual life makes this film more intimate as it unfolds as some affectionate parlor trick and wink of the eye. Bronson and Ireland explore unknown passions and tenderness of the soul as two strangers thrown together by fate for their accidental afternoon tryst. Elmer Bernstein is known for his more rousing scores that he composed for Westerns. Here Bernstein employs a romantic and bittersweet score for this fairytale Western that works beautifully for the charismatic Bronson and Epicurean Ireland. This is a wonderful film.,1415059200,,731,5.3652173913043475
8492151,4,B0063NT8S8,"For many, Charles Bronson has a reputation as a rather monolithic screen presence that's not entirely undeserved considering how lazy many of his 80s and 90s films were, but in the mid-70s when his star was still riding high he could still challenge people's perceptions with a much more engaged performance in an unexpected gem like From Noon Till Three only to see it ignored by both his action movie fanbase disappointed by the lack of a body count and more upmarket audiences who weren't convinced by the star's presence in a surprisingly sophisticated black comedy romance alike. Based on Pulitzer Prize-winning writer-director Frank D. Gilroy's own novel From Noon Till Three: The Possibly True and Certainly Tragic Story of an Outlaw and a Lady Whose Love Knew No Bounds, it's a shame the film is so little known and so rarely revived.

Bronson is (perhaps) a former colonel who has fallen on hard times since the Civil War and is now riding with Douglas Fowley's motley band of outlaws en route to the biggest bank robbery of their lives, but a troubling nightmare that an ambush lies in wait leads him to take advantage of an injury to his horse to sit out the raid at refined widow Jill Ireland's remote mansion. In the three hours that he spends waiting for their return a relationship gradually blossoms as her haughty exterior melts and his own true character emerges only for the law to put an abrupt end to things. Escaping only to be jailed for another man's crimes, he emerges from prison a year later eager to rekindle their romance to find that in the interim she has turned it into an international best-selling novel, play and song, the mansion becoming a shrine for tourists and the story so elaborately over-romanticised that she doesn't recognize the real man anymore - and when she finally does, she doesn't want the unvarnished truth destroying the legend that the whole world has taken to its heart...

The film was never going to be an easy sell, shifting from Western to romance to black comedy with a resolution that makes perfect sense but certainly left many enchanted by the love story and hoping for a more Hollywood ending disappointed. The presence of the usually stiff-as-a-board Mrs Bronson in a demanding role probably didn't help any more than the cartoonish Mad Magazine-style posters a desperate studio used to market it. Yet it's a quirky little delight of a movie that has fun subverting expectations, not least of its leading man. Bronson is quite the revelation here, clearly having a ball in the kind of part that Burt Lancaster would have played only a few years earlier, delivering writer-director Gilroy's occasionally elegant dialogue as if it were second nature and taking advantage of the script's ample opportunities to show a range that was rarely asked of him as he's forced to adopt multiple disguises and identities in the second half of the film as he finds himself cast out of his own legend even by his former friends. While Ireland isn't as effortlessly natural, that works in her favour in the early scenes and she certainly ups her usual game this time round and has moments where she's refreshingly natural and unforced, possibly because it's one of the few times in her husband's films that she was working with a director who actually wanted her in his film. The two really do light up in some of their scenes together for the only time in their 18 films together.

There's also an excellent score from Elmer Bernstein: more a gentle wistful romantic one than a boots and saddles one, with a particularly beautiful love theme, Hello and Goodbye, that even Jill Ireland's vocal rendition can't ruin, it's closer to his work on 'smaller' films like To Kill a Mockingbird than his more robust scores, and just as effective in its own way. (Bernstein and co-lyricist Alan Bergman even cameo in the film as a pair of song pluggers.)

After all but vanishing for years aside from a less than impressive Spanish DVD, the film has re-emerged on VOD (it never got a US DVD release), though the German Blu-ray and DVD releases are a much better bet, boasting a cleaned up widescreen transfer, original trailer and stills gallery as extras. It's not quite a classic, but it is something of a charmer.",1374796800,2,4256,4.770691994572592
