912884,5,6304614071,"The many worlds of Star Trek have taken us from our past to the distant future of humankind.  This episode sends us deep into some of the most uncharted of space -- Picard's soul. This exceptional script gives actor  Patrick Stewart a chance to reach in a grab the viewer's emotional core.
Stewart, an actor of far more range than is usually demanded of by The  Next Generation, gives a subtle and smart performance.  Moving and deeply  affecting especially is the sight of him as a father and grandfather.  Trying to save his doomed world, Picard endeavors to out-think the local  government.  Buying time, if not real hope.
The haunting music proves to  be the emotional punch.  The fact the show pre-dates the entire recent  penny whistle glut only shows that Star Trek is sometimes truly ahead of  its time.
This exceptional drama is amoung the best ever produced for the  Star Trek lexicon, primarily for its ability to show us the strength of  humanity in the face of overwhelming tragedy.",911260800,,995,4.742690058479532
912997,4,6304614071,"Despite my predisposition toward darker, more action oriented episodes, I am somewhat in awe of this epsiode.  This release went a long way in portraying Jean Luc Picard as an person... rounding out his persona and cementing those subtle characteristics (desire for family, internal need of belonging, lonliness) that we have all seen over many episodes.  If anything, the real heroes of this episode are the writers.
This clever painting of an internal portrait starts off almost as a cliche'. A stereo-typical lost space probe under investigation by the Enterprise.  This kind of plot device gets me to yawn everytime but, from there, the cheap wrapping falls away to reveal a non-pretentious psychological view of a race that knows of its demise, of a Starship captain who has long thought the grass may greener on the side of the common man and of emotions that we have, most likely, all thought and felt in our lifetime.
True to past and future episodes, the screen play deals well with Picard's internal yearnings.  The subtle work with words and Patrick Stewarts ability to touch an emotional nerve ending are used well... not heavily handed... as the plot weaves an emotional tale that ties into past and future episodes.
I could tell you the mechanics of the episode (Kamin, Star Probe, dying civilization, frustration, flute playing, haunting memories) but no words that I could pen would say it as well, as intricately and be true to the series as the writers have done in this episode.
There are some shortcomings... the actor's make-up is far from exemplary, the plot glosses over issues due to time constraints and the initial premise has been served to more people than MacDonald's hamburgers.
In spite of those obvious faults, this epsiode has quietly won me over after many viewings and stands as a testament on why the entire series suceeded.",1037318400,,1860,4.932907348242812
912998,5,6304614071,In this one Picard is knocked cold by a space probe and lives a lifetime in about twenty minutes in a alternate universe.  You have to see this one to believe it. He has a bit more of a humble life as a community leader in a less technical culture. Picard has a family and grows old while in a dream like state on the bridge. It really is worth buying this one. You can veiw it several times and find new things you may have missed the first time around.,1016236800,2,454,3.989010989010989

913000,5,6304614071,"""The Inner Light"" is one of the most amazing hours of television that I've ever seen, and quite possibly the greatest Star Trek (original, Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, Voyager) episode of all.  And the thing is, it's not even really science fiction per se...""just"" a great story filled with excellent acting, directing, ideas, and emotion!  Not much!! :)
Where do I even begin to praise ""The Inner Light?""  Well, for one thing, Patrick Stewart is amazing as Kamin, a married man (to a beautiful woman named Eline) living in the community of Ressic on the planet Kataan, which is in the midst of what people think is just a very bad, extended drought.  What really is happening is that the planet is dying, and there's nothing the inhabitants can do except to save a piece of their world in the form of a probe whose purpose is to find ""someone who could be a teacher, someone who could tell the others about us.""  A thousand years later the probe finds that ""someone"" - Picard - who it locks onto in order to allow him to live most of a lifetime in only 20 or 25 minutes!!  What this does is allow Picard to experience everything he never could as a Starship captain - a wife, children, rootedness in a community, and much more.  This episode is worth watching for that alone, but there's so much more!
Besides Patrick Stewart as Kamin, let me just list a few other great things about this episode (in no particular order):  1) Patrick Stewart's real-life son Daniel does a fine job as Kamin's son Batai (named after Kamin's late best friend); 2) Kamin's passionate -- and classic -- advice (knowing that the planet is dying) to his daughter, Meribor on whether she should marry her boyfriend Danek ""sooner rather than later"" is powerful:  ""Seize the day, Meribor.  Live now! Make NOW always the most precious time! Now will never come again"" (Meribor's response: ""I love you father""); 3) the oily 'Administrator,' who condescendingly assures Kamin that his idea for atmospheric condensers will be considered (Kamin, of course, knows that ""there will be no condensers""); 4) the beautiful, haunting music, especially of the flute that Kamin plays; 5) the end of the show, when Riker hands Picard the same flute and leaves Picard to hug the flute to his body as he tries to hold on to what he has just experienced, the woman he loved, the children and grandchild he had, etc.; 6) the friendship between Picard and Council Member Batai; 7) the love that grows between Kamin and his wife, Eline, and in particular the scene where Kamin says he wants to build something but needs her permission first, and the look on Eline's face when he says ""a nursery,"" and much more.
What's amazing about ""The Inner Light"" is that, although not a phaser is fired, and although 95% of the show takes place off the Enterprise, this is still a great Star Trek episode - maybe the best ever (ranking up there with ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and  ""Yesterday's Enterprise"").  Poignant, thought-provoking, dramatic, mind-boggling - these are just some of the adjectives that come to mind with ""The Inner Light.""  In sum, this is one of the most amazing hours of television ever.  Buy it now; watch it now!",998524800,32,3189,4.661319073083779
913001,5,6304614071,"This has to be the most amazing episode in Star Trek history!!! I never wanted it to end. Very rarely do I encounter a piece of television where it should never end. I shared every moment, sympathized and empathized. I laughed, and also shed a tear. this episode could have lasted all day I would have loved every minute!! To see Picard as a normal person, without all the starfleet pomp and circumstance, clearly was emotional (especially when the viewer realizes his true worth as a captain).
Well done patrick and a big thumbs up to the writers.",973123200,13,548,4.6020408163265305
913002,5,6304614071,"This is, in my opinion, the best chapter ever wrote and play of ST universe. I think that the mind is all, and here the plot shows you how powerfull the mind is. Don't miss it, don't need to be a ST fan to see it.",963964800,5,213,3.652173913043478
913003,5,6304614071,"The ""Inner Light"" is one of the most philosophical espisodes in  the series.  What would someone do if they woke up as a different person on  a different world?  It takes Picard about 5 years to realize that whatever  has happened to him, whether his other life aboard the Enterprise was real  or not, this is now his life and he will have to live with it.  Not that it  is a bad life.
While Picard is actually unconscious on the bridge of the  enterprise, it seems that less than a minute passes there for each year  Picard ""lives"" on the planet.
In his new life, he starts a  family with his wife, who he grows to love. He uses his scientific  knowledge to discover that the planet is dying of a drought brought on by  the early stages of the death of its sun.
By the time he nears the end of  his life, he realizes that his grand kids will never live to be adults.  It  is not long before he will learn why he was brought here, and what happens  to his family and friends.
One of the best moments for me was when, after  the birth of his second child, he states that he had never thought that he  needed children to make his life complete, but now he could not imagine his  life without them.  If he returns to the Enterprise, he will have to learn  to do just that.
This episode also deepens Picard's character as it shows  his interaction with a family. It shows that though he will probably never  truly have a family of his own, he would make a great husband and father.",962668800,6,1477,4.156028368794326
913004,5,6304614071,"This is one of the greatest episodes of The Next Generation.  This episode shows a side of Star Trek that is not seen much.

913005,5,6304614071,"Anyone who says television is a barren wasteland has never sat and watched ""Star Trek:TNG"". ""The  Inner Light"" has to be one of, if not the best, moments in TV history!  This episode will make you smile,  bring a tear to your eye, and perhaps win you over to the ""world""  of Star Trek(if you are not already there!).  Watch as Picard  ""lives"" an entire lifespan, a brief moment in  ""real-time"", as a mysterious probe imparts the final chapter of a  long-dead civilization into his mind, and leaves a parting gift, a simple  flute(seen again in later episodes), as a ""Thank You"" and tender  reminder of his ""experience"".

The writers and cast always managed to produce great moments, but The Inner Light is filled with great moments. Memorable scenes that take you on an emotional journey that, based on what has been written in these reviews, has touched many, deeply, sincerely.

I am amazed that this episode is so popular.  It may be great acting, and great dialog, and a great story (I don't think so) but it's too depressing to watch, IMHO.  It also has almost nothing to do with space exploration which is what draws me to Star Trek.  Give me Yesterday's Enterprise or Tapestry or All Good Things, but The Inner Light is not on my wish list.",1267401600,,525,4.3061224489795915
7875910,5,6304614071,"This episode is certainly worth owning.  To me, it embodies everything that was great about Patrick Stewart's classically influenced TNG acting chops, and the quality and sensibilities that made/make Star Trek so great.  In fact, it is this sort of writing that makes science fiction thick and rich with potential.  It's about imagination, but imagination within the realm of possibility.  How many other worlds are out there now?  How many have come and gone before us?  This episode explores those very ideas and does it with class, style and panache.  I can't explain this episode.  Well, I could, but I can't do it justice, just watch.  Watch with an open mind and an open heart, and I guarantee you'll come away a bit more sensitive towards the universe around you.  You may also notice a haunting tug each time you look at a distant star.",1174348800,,844,4.758620689655173
7875911,5,6304614071,"I agree with everyone else - this may well be the most wonderful episode of TV drama ever.  I have seen it again and again and I always love it. I am a lifelong Star Trek fan and I wanted to share a wonderful recent experience.  My daughters and I went to see the National Symphony Orchestra perform ""To Boldly Go, (narrated by Leonard Nimoy)"" at Wolf Trap in Virginia, and they included the melody from ""The Inner Light"" in the program.

Legions of Star Trek fans were absolutely thrilled!",1152748800,3,490,4.4222222222222225
7875912,5,6304614071,"I agree with other 5-star reviewers. This is not only the best episode of this long-running series, but one of the best hours of television, period.
The story first struck me in this way (and by the way, I think you need to be of a certain age to think of it this way -- teenagers can skip over this thought): What if I were to suddenly awaken and find that I was back in, say, 1976 -- when I was 20? And realized that the last 30 or so years had been a dream, that my wife and children and friends, the things I had done and places I had been, were all gone -- and I had to start all over again, with an entirely different future ahead of me? The psychological impact would, of course, be staggering. Thinking in these terms, you can feel what Picard felt when he was returned to his former life.
But there's another element I didn't think about until later: The issue of the Kataanians (or whatever they're called) doing something like this to an innocent bystander. They violated Picard's mind to a horrific extent; their desire to be remembered motivated them to carry out a heinous crime against Picard. There's more food for thought in this episode than in probably the rest of the series combined.
By the way, my favorite scene was this: Kamin (Picard), after several ""years"" have passed in his new life, finally and grudgingly begins to accept the fact that he never was Jean Luc Picard, and there never was an Enterprise or a place called Earth, etc. And then he picks up his flute and plays... ""Frere Jacques"". A brilliant scene.",1134864000,2,1539,4.4035087719298245
7875913,5,6304614071,"For someone who digested almost every episode of this show over it's run I guess I slept on this for awhile. But when I revisted it after the series ended and now it is one of my top five favorite stand alone episodes and I know it is to alot of other people. I think one reason is you don't have to be a Star Trek fan to enjoy it. Little of it takes place in the Star Trek universe. But the story touches the viewer in some very unexpected ways with alot of emotional twists and turns.

  What is it about?The Enterprise encounters this ancient probe in space and it zapps Captain Picard. He awakens to find himself in another world in someone elses life-a man named Kamen living with his wife on the planet Kataan. At first he still doesn't believe his surroundings but soon that changes. As years pass he learns his world is suffering a drought and he and his best friend Batai are working to change that in some way. Sadly his friend passes on before the birth of his second child,a boy who is named after him. As years pass the drought becomes worse until ""Kamen"" finds himself an old man with grandchildren whom,sadly,he knows will have their lives cut abruptly short by the conditions of his planet. The last thing that occurs is when Kataan launches their first robotic

space probe and guess what?It is the same probe that zapped Picard. Turns out that Kataan's sun went nova,the cause of the draught and the entire life he experienced only occured within a few minutes. But now he will doubtless ever forget anyone on Kataan again.

  This story is full of emmotional release,a wondefully written story and very likable characters. By the end you find yourself sad the the relateable people of Kataan no longer exist in Picards world. The solitary and,I belive lonely starship captain finds himself with a loving family of his own and even a kindly supportive friend in Batai. By the way Patrick Stewarts son Daniel portrays Kamen's grown son of the same name (Batai that is).And since he was granted the gift to remember what happened to him on Kataan I always believed this was the rallying cry to Jean-Luc Picard to become less of a solitary inividual. Just amazing writing,acting and storytelling all around. And it is this type of dyamic by which I tend to measure all other Trek stories by,for better or worse.",1116460800,2,2326,4.563549160671463
7875914,5,6304614071,"Twelve years ago (it's now May 2004), my husband and I, who were/are big Star Trek-TNG fans, saw this episode when it first aired in spring 1992.  We had been trying to decide whether to have children--a scary decision since we knew it would change our lives drastically, and the world isn't always a safe place.  Captain Picard's words (in his other life) halfway through the episode, when he was watching his children, hit us like a ton of bricks:  ""I never used to think I needed children to complete my life; but now, I can't imagine my life without them.""  (That's probably a pretty close quote considering I haven't watched this episode in years!)  The story, the change in Picard, and the music that accompanied it worked together to change us.  Four months later, I was pregnant; that baby, Brian Geordi (guess where his middle name ""Geordi"" came from?) just turned 11 years old last month.  He celebrated his birthday with us and his 7-year-old brother, Daniel.  Funny--our Brian Geordi seems destined to be a talented engineer just like his namesake; he can do advanced math (high school level) in his head in seconds and has an amazing understanding of physics and astronomy--he can keep up with many of the theories Stephen Hawking explains in his books and can manipulate abstract ideas in ""3-D"" in his mind.  The kid builds with anything he can get his hands on, and he draws (in great detail) what he doesn't have the materials to build.  He's enthusiastically trying to come up with a design for the first warp engine; the kid just might get us there someday.  His little brother makes just about every moment a delight--finds fun, humor, and joy in almost everything and uses this talent to great advantage with us and his teachers when he's in trouble.
We've been watching our ""Star Trek-TNG"" first season DVD set with the boys during the past year, so they're now familiar with the story and the characters.  They love just about all the Star Trek movies (Kirk's and Picard's crews), and they're starting to be able to pick up on our allusions to characters and quotes--""You will be assimilated""; Worf's ""Assimilate THIS!""; getting caught in a temporal loop (believe me, this happens with kids!); Data's comment on the pronunciation of his name: ""One is my name; the other is not""; etc.  Now, it's time for these two boys to see the Star Trek episode that helped get them here.
Picard was right; I can't imagine my life without my boys; how empty it would have been compared to my ""other"" life . . . and how lucky I am that I didn't miss it.  It's changed me and taught me more than I can imagine, and I discovered that love is so much more than I ever knew (both harder and better).  Now, I can say that I have truly LIVED.  Sorry for the mushy review--but as you read the comments of the other reviewers, you'll see that this episode touched many, many people.  (God sends His messages and wisdom in many forms . . . and it's come to me through Star Trek more than once.  I am eternally grateful to both.)",1084492800,13,3026,4.561922365988909
7875915,5,6304614071,"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said by the other reviewers but I had to add to the tribute - this is, by far, the most amazing episode of any television show I have ever seen.  Never have I been so moved by a tv show.  I have been a lifelong Trekkie, but never has Star Trek shined this brightly.
I have seen it at many times, but I never fail to be moved by its delicacy, emotion and absolutely in-depth exploration of Jean-Luc Picard, as opposed to Captain Picard.  Later episodes that feature the flute always left me with a lump in my throat as I relived the emotion of this episode.  Superbly done, no praise is enough.  If you never buy any other episode - at least buy this one.  You won't be sorry.",1067904000,3,727,4.1571428571428575
