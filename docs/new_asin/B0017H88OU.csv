8265871,5,B0017H88OU,"I also watched the mini series on MHZ Networks out of NoVA.  Due to the series overwhelming popularity MHZ was gracious enough to rerun the series numerous times---so everyone would get a good copy!

The movie was just that; a movie.  Very condensed and moved very quickly.  To have viewed the movie without the benefit and luxury of watching the series would be a waste, you simply wouldn't get it....

The series and the film are truly one of a kind. I consider myself very lucky to have copies of both!",1410393600,2,505,4.5054945054945055
8265872,5,B0017H88OU,Excellent series as it gets into the culture of Finland while telling a good story with great characters - worked fine on my DVD player,1404000000,,135,4.44
8265873,5,B0017H88OU,"I first saw the Raid (Mini Series) on MHZ Networks International Mystery.  At that time the show was hosted by Michael Jeck.  It was such a popular show that it spun off a sequel movie also called Raid.  The movie was shown at the AFI theatre in Silver Spring, MD.  A live discussion was held after the movie with Tapio Piirainen, the movie's director; Kai Lehtinen, the actor who played Raid; and the audience.  Michael Jeck was the Moderator and took part in the discussions. The music in the movie was played by the excellent actress Oiva Lohtander, who was the female star of the movie.  Although each can be watched alone, it is more fun to WATCH THE SERIES BEFORE THE MOVIE.  Both the action series and the movie, both had many very funny parts.  I liked the shows so much I bought a region free DVD player so that I could watch them again.",1400544000,3,846,4.378205128205129
8265874,5,B0017H88OU,"Character development and acting are the strength of this drama of political conspiracy with dire economic consequences. Piirainen says that the events surrounding Escon are fictional, but in the wake of the collapse of the US company Enron, they are very believable. Kai Lehtinen plays Raid as an instinctive but troubled hero, surrounded by quirky, well-developed characters. Raid is at times almost a superhero, an effective, but self-restrained killing machine, but can be all too human. Lehtinen is stoically handsome, but not a pretty boy.

One wonders if Hollywood could ever cast a leading lady like Mari Rantasila (Tarja), or Kirsti Vaananen (Susisaari), both of whom were very fetching without being runway perfect (or surgically enhanced). Oiva Lohtander (Jansson), Tuula Nyman (Ms Hakala), Juha Muje (Sundman), Esko Salmonen (Uki) and Risto Aaltonen (Hallvik) struck me as utterly convincing in their parts. Pekka Huotari (Huusko) who is called 'Hopo' by coworkers, but Goofy in the subtitles, cracks lame jokes, makes inappropriate comments and delivers obscure lines about Wild Bill Hickock, but manages to be sympathetic. Tapio Liinoja (Hammar) was a deserving villain, not over-the-top, just a self-interested sociopath.

There are many references to American culture: Sundman's Beach Boys songs, posters of Clint Eastwood (homage to Sergio Leone), bottles of Johnnie Walker. There are few recognizable references to any other (non-Finnish) culture, except for automobiles. Two Mercedes, a BMW, a Toyota and a Jaguar figure prominently among the humble Ladas of the police force.",1235952000,2,1595,5.586776859504132
8265875,5,B0017H88OU,"The ""Raid"" television series and subsequent movie from Finland are exceptional.  Both, however, are region 2 DVD's, and require a special player.  I wanted both (which I had watched on a local MHZ station) enough to go to the added expense of buying a multi-region DVD player.

Action packed, with a glimpse into a country that most are not really familiar with, the series and movie are riveting, highly entertaining, and to be watched many times.",1232323200,3,448,4.868421052631579
