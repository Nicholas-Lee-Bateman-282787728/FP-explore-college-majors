6673105,3,B00NNQJKG8,"I've always liked Ryan Phillippe, and gave Catch Hell a chance when I saw he worked both in front of and behind the camera.  A washed up actor is trying to get his career back on track and takes a part in a low-budget movie.  He's kidnapped and held captive by a couple of backwoods rednecks where he's beaten and tortured.  It's a decent flick.  Phillippe does a good job, as does Stephen Louis Grush as Junior.  The film goes to some dark places, especially towards the end, but I enjoyed it.  It's a little rough around the edges, but if you like Phillippe or the genre itself, it's worth a look.",1421280000,5,599,4.303571428571429
6673106,4,B00NNQJKG8,"like Ryan Phillippe, he did a good job selling the suspense thriller. I liked the movie a lot.",1421193600,,94,4.277777777777778
6673107,4,B00NNQJKG8,"This film is insane but in such a good way! It's a revenge film but who gets revenge on whom is the question? Ryan Phillippe wrote, directed and stars in Catch Hell a film about an actor trying to make a comeback who is kidnapped and tortured for something he might or might not have done in the past.

His kidnappers are two backwoods Louisiana swamp dwellers. One is the dominant and of course one is the half wit. What sets this apart from the many other films with this same template,you may ask? Well, plenty! The performances were really intense, of course by Philippe but Stephen Louis Grush as Junior was pitch perfect. He was seen recently on Gracepoint.

Catch Hell is quite brutal and flinch worthy. If seeing an alligator skinned and filleted is upsetting to you then you shouldn't watch it or should close your eyes. The things that happen to Philippe's character ""Reagan"" are unimaginable and they take it to places you never thought they would go, but the film was all the better for them doing so.

Will Reagan escape by out witting his captors or will they get the best of him? You will have to rent or buy the movie to find out! There was some very clever dialogue and situations which made this a very well rounded film. There wasn't any gore but there was blood and disturbing violence!",1420848000,8,1306,4.5021097046413505

6673115,4,B00NNQJKG8,"Strong suspense film, some weak script, but good performances that held attention, the weakest being the aggrieved ex husband kidnapper. He seemed like a stunt man who for some reason has been given a starring role in a film. Have to say Ryan Philippe who I actually don't like that much and think his tattoos don't look good, can sometimes act really well. I don't think though someone who had been beaten and tortured as much as he had could be so unexpressive of the amount of pain he was in or suffering/damage he had sustained. Regardless, I watched and definitely was interested in the whole story and what would come next. It does have a 1970s edginess to it. I think if it came out in the 70s it would get a lot more attention than it got when it did. Would have liked more psychology in the script and characters but that wasn't the premise. And the premise was actually believable. .

Spoiler Alert:
Given the trauma he went through, the interview was lite. Could have been a tour de force acting opportunity/moment for Philippe but he chose to not maximize the dramatic moment which was a loss",1463184000,,1104,4.52
6673116,3,B00NNQJKG8,Hard movie to watch with so much senseless torture and a little too long for my taste.,1462838400,,86,4.117647058823529

6673118,5,B00NNQJKG8,"Former Hollywood star Reagan Pearce (Ryan Phillippe) is kidnapped by two men connected to his past while on location in Louisiana. When he wakes up bound and chained in a rundown shack, he soon discovers the real motives of his captors and finds himself in the middle of a twisted scheme with little chance to survive. I may be slightly biased but I don't think so....I think Ryan Phillippe is one of Hollywood's undiscovered gems. Ryan, stars in, directs and wrote this taut and tense movie. Basically a 3 man show, he and the 2 men who kidnapped him are the crux of the story. Why did they really take Ryan? What do they intend? Each man has his own designs. they played the parts SO well. They were both pretty scary. Now as for Ryan. WOW. he wrote this story and directed it, each a monumental task that was done successfully. The acting, HUGe WOW. he plays a selfish hollywood actor, he doesn't know why he is taken, they do unspeakable things to him in many ways. Will he get away? Will he die? Be prepared for some very raw and violent scenes. But I recommend it.",1457222400,,1070,4.409090909090909

6673120,4,B00NNQJKG8,"This was a change of pace seeing this film.  Ryan Phillippe did a great job in it.  It was not what I was expecting, but glad I got to see it, and knew I had to add it to my collection.  It's dark, a bit creepy and intense at times.  Nothing like being kidnapped and left in swamp land with alligators...",1448064000,,304,3.9344262295081966
6673121,3,B00NNQJKG8,After reading the reviews I was very excited to see this movie but I was let down. Very slow paced and not a lot of action. Worth a rental but don't get your hopes up,1444089600,,166,3.7714285714285714
6673122,5,B00NNQJKG8,I'm a fan of Ryan Phillippe so I was excited that he had written and directed his own movie . This movie kept me closing my eyes and gritting my teeth a few times . It's strange in a good kind of way . After watching it a few times I'm now a big fan of the film . He did excellent with the story and actors he chose for a first time directorial .It's definitely worth watching . Kudos Ryan !.,1442448000,,392,3.792682926829268
6673123,5,B00NNQJKG8,"This is a pretty awesome suspense.  It involves two men (the overpowering and intimidating Ian Barford and his nephew Stephen Louis Grush) who kidnap a Hollywood actor (Ryan Phillippe) because Ryan apparently once had sexual relations with Barford's girlfriend, so he's out for revenge while his nitwit nephew helps out.

When Ryan thinks someone involved in helping boost his acting career pulls up alongside the hotel and asks him to jump inside to go film a scene somewhere, Ryan gets in and thinks nothing of it.  He doesn't question the two men at all.  However these two men have a really sick and disturbing plan in store for poor Ryan. They're going to take him to an abandoned log cabin in the woods, smash his body parts, torture him, tie him to the floor, and humiliate Ryan/damage his reputation as a famous actor by sending out emails and tweets around the world that makes it look like Ryan is criticizing/disrespecting millions of people along with the nude pictures of his girlfriends that he's been keeping on his phone.  This movie has a bunch of cellphone and internet segments written into the story giving it a more modern/relevant approach.

My favorite scene is when Ryan wakes up in the morning after being nearly beaten to death and sees an alligator right in front of him as Stephen squeezes its mouth shut, lol.  The look on Ryan's face is one that shows unbelievable surprise and fear!  Turns out the alligator smelled the blood dripping from Ryan's beaten body, so rather awkwardly the one man (of two) responsible for kidnapping Ryan and making blood pour from his body actually ends up saving his life.

It was never clear why Ian Barford took Ryan's short involvement with his girlfriend so personally, since it seemed believable that this girl was involved with other men as well and that Ryan wasn't nearly as close to her as much as other men were.  Then again when Ian forced Ryan to share all the personal details of the relationship including the sexual moments, I wasn't sure if Ryan was being sarcastic in his gross exaggeration or what.  I assume he was being sarcastic because he figured he was already tied up, tortured and drained so he might as well get under Ian's skin to make him angrier!

I suppose without spoiling the ending, the only major disappointment is that... well, the way the story ends.  Yeah it's predictable.  You'll know what's going to happen but the *way* it happens lacks suspense in a big way.  After such a magnificent build-up of suspense for over an hour, we needed a more satisfying outcome than what we got.  Also weird that Ian Barford goes away for a couple days I guess because he works as a security guard downtown, and hands all kidnapping duties over to Stephen.  However it's VERY important that Stephen pick up the phone whenever Ian calls or he'll go ballistic on his poor nephew!  Anyway Stephen tries to develop a relationship with Ryan but uh... yeah.  I'm not referring to a friendship.  I'm referring to something more than a friendship!

The acting is really good and the suspense is strong for the most part.  The story is probably clichd involving typical kidnapping and torture and of course the ending wasn't that great, but the movie's entertaining enough for a movie plot.  I recommend this.",1442102400,,3285,4.744718309859155

I found it entertaining and some parts had me cringe - always a good sign for a  movie.

6673129,4,B00NNQJKG8,"This is a beyond-average kidnapping-thriller with great acting and interesting plot.  If I recall it correctly, I think I have seen an Italian film from 1970's that had identically developing story-line...but that was years ago, and I don't remember the title.  Catch Hell (2014) is a debut film by Ryan Philippe, who also starts in the film as the main protagonist named Reagan Pearce.  The film opens with Pearce, who is an actor on the verge of losing his fame, taking a plane to Louisiana for a movie shoot.  Pearce is upset and depressed with the way his career turned up to be.  Once in the hotel he receives a telephone call letting him know that there is a car waiting for him downstairs to take him to his first day of film shooting...what follows afterwards will change the actor's life forever.

**Spoiler Alert**

What I would like to know is the following: what is that video that is played with credits at the end? what does it mean? is there something that I
missed? was Pearce really bisexual? that video really freaked me out...
And why did the guy who kidnapped Pierce was previously married to a black woman if he was your typical Hillbilly racist?...does not make any sense.",1434844800,3,1194,4.630331753554502

6673137,1,B00NNQJKG8,"The only positive thing about this film is that Ryan Phillippe was in it. I like him and think he's a pretty good actor. That being said, this film was horrible and the fact that Phillippe directed it makes it mainly his fault. I won't waste time writing more than a few lines but there is nothing original about this movie. It's stereotypical to the point of being offensive. The characters are one-dimensional. We have the washed up Hollywood actor and two dumb, redneck hillbillies who can't spell and act like cavemen yet they are skillful when it comes to passing themselves off as Ryan's character on the computer. Okay. Wow. NOTHING ORIGINAL! I am so sick of movies depicting Southern people as idiots, racists, and rednecks. It's downright insulting! It's also sad that this film stole a page from Deliverance and...SPOILER ALERT...Ryan's character is almost raped by one of the rednecks. See what I mean? Where was the originality?

If you want to see a movie with no imagination, cardboard characters, and no point then Catching Hell is for you. But if you want to see a well-acted film with good writing then turn the other way. This movie is definitely not that! I wish I could unsee it! It's that bad.",1426636800,,1214,4.699530516431925
