4445046,5,B004Q66V16,"Ok, I'm biased, Sarah Longacre is a long time friend and colleague in our large birthing community. That said, this prenatal yoga video is meticulously done to make it simple for you. Very active, you will get a workout. The music is fantastic, made for the video. The birth clips are perfect for a yoga or birth education gathering. Doula friendly, of course! Professionally filmed, the camera moves to keep it interesting.
There is a chanting section separate from the yoga class, which some of my Christian friends are not going to prefer. Others will love that chapter for the harmonious and positive vocalizations which will vibrate through to baby and body.
If you want a calm, slower prenatal yoga class with props and more alignment tips, see Collette Crawford's prenatal yoga video or others.
This is an active, moving, fun and festive experience to bring out a sweat. Sarah's encouraging and guiding words will echo in your mind as you go through labor. Her word choice is excellent for trusting and coping with the natural process of labor. Doing this yoga is a good preparation for active birthing.
Could anything make it better? Not really, but perhaps, combine it with even more education from SpinningBabies.com ! --Maybe Sarah and I need to share a cup of tea and dream of video 2!  Or as my 85-year-old mom says, ""Forget the tea, pour the wine!""
Blooma Prenatal Yoga is trendy, hip, and effective!",1301270400,6,1414,4.818930041152264
4445047,5,B004Q66V16,"A friend who lives in Minnesota suggested this DVD, and boy am I ever glad she did!  Since I'm down in Alabama, my chances of making it to Blooma before my 2nd little one is born this summer are slim to none.  Since I'm a working mama with a lively toddler, my chances of making it to an actual prenatal yoga class are pretty slim, too.  So imagine my delight when I heard that this fabulous yoga studio that caters to mamas before and after birth had created its first DVD.  I have not been disappointed, and find myself eagerly anticipating the pockets of time when I can take some time to do the easy-to-follow, feels-so-good-to-my-pregnant body yoga sequence.  There is something here for the experienced and novice yoga practitioner, and for mamas-to-be no matter what your age or fitness level.  I particularly appreciate the one mom on the DVD who does not appear to be as flexible as the others, and often look at her for encouragement!  At the end are a number of birth stories, which I have found to be realistic and inspirational.  Particularly grateful that there is one beautiful medicated birth, as this is something I had not seen previously.  Thanks so much to Sarah Longacre and the crew at Blooma for creating such a lovely gift for pregnant women.  This would make a wonderful gift from any pregnant woman to herself, or from friends or family who know the mama-to-be enjoys having the chance to move her body in gentle, strong and loving ways.",1300924800,3,1463,4.613899613899614
4445048,5,B004Q66V16,I bought this because it was recommended to me by a friend and I can see why! I'm so happy I spent the money on this!,1353715200,,117,3.5384615384615383
4445049,5,B004Q66V16,"I was fortunate enough to practice yoga at a Blooma studio during my first pregnancy, it was amazing. We've since moved across the country - and now pregnant with #2, I am seriously missing my Blooma! This DVD is beautiful. I was skeptical that I would be able to get a similar experience on my own, but it really is the best work out video I've ver owned, pregnant or not. While I still miss the fellowship of mamas in class, I truly appreciate having this DVD as an option for a great work out.",1349136000,,496,4.231578947368421
4445050,5,B004Q66V16,"I am lucky enough to have Bloom in my community as a great resource during pregnancy.
I have been taking Sarah's classes since week 18. I recommended her DVD to a girlfriend and tried it myself.
Her approach to Yoga is just what every Mama-to-be needs.",1334016000,,252,4.5
4445051,5,B004Q66V16,"As a Blooma client I was hesitant to order as I thought there was no way a DVD could compare to their in-house experience. Boy was I wrong! This DVD is amazing! Sarah is a gift to all expectant mothers. The yoga moves she guides you through are easily adapted to all experience levels. The super bonus is the birth stories at the end. It was highly empowering to be part of these women's individual births and provided me with an overwhelming sense of ""I can do this and it doesn't have to be a crazy experience.""

Strongly recommend to anyone who is expecting. It will change your life!",1309478400,,587,4.385321100917431
4445052,5,B004Q66V16,Blooma changed my life when I was pregnant the first time. It is the most amazing place! I don't particularly like being pregnant but the prenatal classes at blooma is one of the only times I feel really good when I am pregnant. And now I can have blooma in my own home whenever my schedule permits. I highly recommend getting to the blooma studio but if you don't live nearby or your schedule doesn't permit it very often you have to have the dvd!!!,1306886400,,450,4.305882352941176
4445053,5,B004Q66V16,"I am a dedicated Blooma customer, but I recently switched jobs and I can't make it there as often as I'd like. So I was thrilled when the DVD was released just when I needed it! Although I have personally taken classes from Sarah, it was really easy to follow and so great to wake up and walk downstairs to my own yoga mat! I love this DVD and highly recommend it for pregnant mamas.",1306800000,,383,4.12
4445054,5,B004Q66V16,"Better than cartoons at my house; my 4yr old wants to watch the mama who sings and baby comes out in the water EVERYDAY for the past month now. I shared the video with her as I was hoping to prepare her for attending my birth and she is hooked. I contacted all the moms who shared their births and asked questions and shared gratitude for their courage and strength. From chapstick to singing, squatting to pushing up against trees, I find more things to bring to my own birth(if there is time). Thank you Sarah for giving so much to women all over the world. My family loves Blooma and the beautiful community surrounding.",1306800000,,623,4.426086956521739
4445055,5,B004Q66V16,"The Blooma Prenatal Yoga DVD is everything I was looking for - challenging, strengthening, mindful of breathing techniques and relaxing. Sarah's instruction is clear and easy to follow. Good for all yoga levels and stages of pregnancy. The background chanting by Carin Vagle is excellent! Adds an extra special element to the DVD. Thank you Blooma for coming to my Brooklyn, NY home!",1306800000,,383,5.095238095238095
4445056,5,B004Q66V16,"I am lucky enough to have Blooma as a local resource, but when I can't fit the mere 15 minute drive into my schedule (!!!) I can supplement at home with this wonderfully paced and exquisitely balanced DVD. Instructor Sarah Longacre is so gifted, and was born among other amazing paths to lead mamas joyfully and spiritually through their pregnancies.  Sarah's voice and rhythm are instantly soothing and motivating. She inspires you to engage, be present and give love and respect to the life that you are building and the baby that chose you. Your body warms up and gets into the groove quickly since the progression makes sense. The poses let your body relax and unfold deliberately and comfortably, and soon you've got a nice warm sweat going and are feeling less awkward and more free in your body than you did when you started.

I never knew how much Blooma yoga would mean to me  personally and to my pregnancy. More than any other practice or tip, prenatal yoga has been the way to manage pain, swelling, sleeplessness, stress, grief, fear and anxiety. This DVD captures the magic that we MN mamas get to be a part of - and don't even get me started on the birth videos as I've watched them over and over again to regain my power and courage when I'm feeling doubtful of my abilities. Cheers to those incredible mamas and their beautiful babies. You will be inspired and excited to go into labor after you witness their awesome, empowered births!

I purchased two other yoga DVDs before the Blooma one was released and they are awkward at best. In one of them, yoga seems like an after-thought among the three options of aerobics, strength and yoga on the DVD - the timing was all off and it's rushed and frankly not challenging enough. In the other one I bought, the woman's voice is just creepy and she overdoes the accent on the words inhale and exhale - inHALE ... exHALE ... very strange and they're all wearing these weird unitards that make them look like a pregnancy cult. On the contrary, this DVD makes you feel like you're in the friendly and comfy Blooma studio, with natural light, fantastic, soothing music, and everyday mamas in whom you can see your beautiful self and your baby. It's really like going to your neighborhood yoga studio, rather than some sterilized set with expressionless women and robotic instructors.

Long story long, this is the one you want. You can do 20 mins or the whole thing and finish feeling restored and centered. It's movement and meditation in appropriate measure for pregnant women and I can't wait to see what Sarah and the women of Blooma do next!",1306800000,,2605,4.62987012987013
4445057,5,B004Q66V16,"I'm lucky enough to live in Minneapolis, so I get to attend prenatal yoga classes at Blooma with Sarah. They are great, and I am hooked. I didn't do yoga my first pregnancy and experienced so many aches and pains, well this time around I have been going since I was 15 weeks pregnant and I feel so great now at 26 weeks. I just love it! This DVD is great for the times I can't attend Blooma, it helps me relax and refocus on myself when times get stressful (I'm a SAHM with a 2 year old). It is a nice practice for pregnancy. Also the birth videos were great to watch too. A bit pricey, but worth it especially if you don't have a good prenatal yoga class to attend. I love knowing what poses I can get into when feeling uncomfortable and think I will really use a lot of them in labor this time around.",1306800000,,803,4.056603773584905
8437955,5,B004Q66V16,"I loved this video! Finally, a prenatal yoga sequence that doesn't make me feel like I'm some fragile and weak human being. I enjoyed the sequence very much. Is this a beginning yoga class? Probably not, but if you've ever taken a yoga class it's easy to understand your limits and I have steadily built up to following this video completely. The first few times my strength and stamina were not where I wanted them to be. After doing it for a few weeks I have noticed that they have begun to increase. Hooray!

This practice has helped alleviate many of the discomforts that I had been experiencing and at 30 weeks, there were plenty. As someone who is usually far too busy to actually take a class, this is the next best thing. I can say that this video can easily compare to taking an in-person prenatal yoga class from any reputable yoga studio. I love the movements. It's a fun, energizing and empowering practice. Thank you!",1482969600,,930,4.535714285714286
8437956,5,B004Q66V16,"I got this DVD as a supplement to training that I will be taking soon. It's a great DVD and I've recommended it to someone who was looking for prenatal yoga classes, which are not yet available in my area.",1474070400,,205,4.15
8437957,5,B004Q66V16,"The next best thing to being in class with Sarah :-) If you're looking for a low key routine or are a beginner, check out the AM/PM dvd.",1456272000,,136,3.892857142857143
8437958,5,B004Q66V16,This is a great DVD with a 60 minute program with meditation and lots of hip openers. It is hard if you are not a daily practitioner but do what you can. The women in the DVD are inspiring and made me realized how strong I am and could be while pregnant.,1397520000,,254,3.9038461538461537
8437959,5,B004Q66V16,"I absolutely love this prenatal yoga video. I have done Hot yoga for the last year, and when I became pregnant I was so sad that I would have to give it up. However, when my sister in law passed along this DVD to me, I decided to try it out not expecting too much. But I love it! I do the yoga video every morning and it not only helps me relax, but it makes me feel a lot more connected to my pregnancy and at the same time I am getting a good workout.  I could not recommend this enough! If you enjoy yoga, want to connect with your baby, or just want some good breathing and stretching techniques than buy this DVD. You will not regret it. Make sure you at least try the yoga a few times if you are a beginner to it. Your body will start craving it! :)",1375056000,,755,3.870967741935484
8437960,1,B004Q66V16,"I am sad to say I did not like this video at all, and that I think it is mis advertised as being for ""All Levels.""

I have been practicing yoga for 5 years, though not always as regularly as in other times. Without this experience, I would not have been able to follow along with this video at all. The instructor gives little to no cues for alignment or any special attention to form. Injuries from yoga happen all the time and for the same reason: people pushing their bodies too fast, too far, and without proper coaching. I found the routine in this video moderately challenging-- and definitely downright DIFFICULT for a real beginner.

To see if this was just my perception, I invited a friend over to do it with me (though she isn't pregnant) because she mentioned not having enough $$ to go to a class, but wanting to learn at home to see if she likes it. She is young, generally fit (light runner), and was EXHAUSTED by the end of the practice. Also, I kept having to pause the video and show her how to align her body because without any cues, she was in all kinds of bad form-- the kind of bad form that leads to injury.

I also didn't think there was anything in this video special to prenatal practice other than the birth videos, which isn't why I bought the DVD in the first place. There are a few mentions like, ""listen to the wisdom of your baby"" kind of stuff, but no real, useful information about why a pose is benefitial or not or how to modify positions for pregnant bodies.

I think a real beginner-to-intermediate person would be better off with another DVD, and an advanced practitioner doesn't need this one.

So what's the point?",1369008000,10,1656,4.381107491856677
8437961,5,B004Q66V16,"I wanted to throw in my two cents because when I purchased this I noticed that a lot of the five-star reviews were from people with connections to the Blooma studio.  I was worried that this dvd would fail to impress someone without the benefit of that context.  It is wonderful, though, I'm really glad I ordered it.  It is a well-balanced and well-rounded routine, challenging and relaxing.  I am very early in my pregnancy so I don't have to make physical accommodations for my baby, but I am fatigued. This yoga was not so fast paced as to be too overwhelming, but it was challenging enough to energize me rather than just put me to sleep! The instructor is very warm and encouraging without sounding insincere and I appreciated her tips describing how the different postures are helpful during labor. There are also ""extras"" - both an audio and video version of the routine you can use on your mobile device, and a couple brief pdfs with tips for labor and reasons you might want to use a doula. I haven't gotten around to watching the birthing videos that are included, but I am looking forward to it.

Another reviewer mentioned that she felt the routine was too spiritual for her as a Christian.  That is fine and I would not encourage anyone to do something they are not comfortable with, but I just wanted to offer another perspective to that because I am also theologically conservative Christian.  I found the spiritual references to be very mild, and I had no trouble tuning out anything I wasn't comfortable with.  Much of what some people might fear is spiritual, instructions to ""ground"" yourself, for instance, are not necessarily spiritual references but postural instruction.  There is a lot of misunderstanding in the Christian community about what aspects of yoga are spiritual and what is simply physical, with some people believing that simply putting your body in a certain pose puts you at risk spiritually. This is a misunderstanding and borders on superstition, which is discouraged by Christianity. A great article for Christians concerned about this can be found here: [...]  And remember, Christ has not given us a spirit of fear, and he knows where our hearts are no matter what the position of our body.",1363392000,7,2235,4.781818181818182
8437962,3,B004Q66V16,"Well my arms were definitely burning! But this Blooma DVD added the spiritual side of yoga which I'm not into.  But I am into the Holy Spirit of Jesus Christ! I think yoga is just a great cardio and strengthening workout and that is all I take it as!  I'm used to doing the P90X yoga which is a great workout too, but doesn't get all weird with spiritual stuff.  I'm going to continue doing my P90X one but make some modifications. No Chataranga,instead replace it with girl pushups! I do have to say they are awesome sellers!  I asked if I could return it and they gave me a refund and didn't ask for the DVD back!",1362960000,,615,4.186440677966102
8437963,5,B004Q66V16,This is a wonderful prenatal yoga practice that has helped me become energized during the day and has also helped me sleep better through the night. This is great throughout all stages of pregnancy especially those who feel fatigued & suffer from insomnia.,1359590400,,256,4.976744186046512
8437964,5,B004Q66V16,"I'm in my second trimester, and I absolutely love this DVD! I practiced yoga pretty regularly before I got pregnant, then took a few months off during my first trimester because I was had no energy. But I knew I needed to start exercising again. I tried a few classes locally (I do not live near this studio or I would have checked it out), but they were all SO basic- just a lot of stretching with bands, blocks, pillows, chairs- nothing like the mat classes I was used to. I was looking for something that felt like a real yoga class, and I'm so glad I found this! The instructor is gentle and encouraging and explains which poses are helpful before and during labor. After doing it just once I could feel the difference in my body. Highly recommended for anyone who is looking for a real yoga workout during pregnancy!",1354492800,,821,4.407894736842105
