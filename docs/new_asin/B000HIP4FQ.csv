8139927,5,B000HIP4FQ,Love Stephen King movies.  They cam on time and properly shipped.  no problem. recommend for others to see.  Definitely a collection to get if you don't have them.,1383350400,,163,4.75
8139928,5,B000HIP4FQ,Movies arrived quickly and in great shape. Movies appear to be authenic and not copied. I have in the past gotten movies from a different seller that looked copied. I collect all Stephen King movies and books. Not so much the continuation of a movie that was not actually from King.,1338422400,,282,4.549019607843137
