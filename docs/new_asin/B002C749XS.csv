8363392,5,B002C749XS,"Man, you've got to see this thing! ... Okay? ... Just get it - and watch it. ... Then, watch it with your friends and musical collaborators. ... Why? ... Because it's all on here - everything! It explains the whole scene, aesthetically, historically, and professionally. This is not just some home made video slapped together by some person who wants to make a mark for himself in the music world and figured he could do it by covering an aspect of the scene that has not been featured before in any way. This is a labor of love put together by a hard core veteran - and all of his fellow hard core veterans - who lived through the whole scene, came out the other side, and is still a part of it to tell all of the rest of us how it all began, evolved, and continues to bloom musical fruit for the whole world to enjoy.

What am I talking about? ... I'm talking about a documentary put together by someone who has the authority to make this film with genuine rights, as he was at the very heart of the scene that is covered in the film. I have known the director of the film, Andrew Szava-Kovats, for well over thirty three years now, and I can honestly say that I have never in my life met a more committed, disciplined, hard working, and multi-talented artist devoted to his craft. It's not just one craft that he excels at, either. He excels at all of them. That he is such a prolific painter, composer, producer, and recording engineer makes him all the more worthy to be the director and producer of this documentary film. The passion he brings to all of his aesthetic pursuits is also clearly evident in the care and artistic beauty he brings to this film. Once again, he has created a work of excellence that will be appreciated by the general public at large and not just the musicians and fans of the scene that is so beautifully captured in this film. Truly, this documentary itself is a work of art by an artist who has always put his heart and soul into his creative work. Watch it and see!

The film covers the American, underground music scene that took fruit and took place in the United States during the nineteen eighties. It covers the whole decade, from start to finish, and incorporates historical, background information at the very beginning of every chapter of the film to inform and / or remind the viewer of the circumstances and conditions that were taking place, sociologically, at the time this music was being made. As the years of the decade progress, one not only gets a mini history lesson or a sociological analysis of current events of that time but also gets a complete overview of how the musicians of that era were influenced by their immediate surroundings as well as the overall gestalt of the period as whole. It also informs the viewer on how these events helped shape the music that the musicians were creating, as well as how this music then further influenced fellow musicians and their listeners, and their views of world events.

The scene was embryonic and primitive, before the days of Pro Tools recording systems using computers, and web sites selling music as downloads over the internet on the world wide web. The scene was cultic, fresh, and totally independent of any involvement in the major music industry or business world of recording contracts with major record labels. In the beginning, it was called the ""D.I.Y."" scene of musicians, their musical collaborators and fans, and the whole, small press, home made publications called ""fanzines"" that supported and highlighted the music and musicians of this burgeoning musical enterprise on the fringes of the post-punk, post new-wave musical eras. It was an exciting time for anyone who had the drive and passion to just dive in and express themselves with no constraints of any kind from outside influences. Yes, there was always the lack of enough money to do what you wanted to do in ways that could never be done without a lot of money. But these creative and clever individuals who started this whole scene found innovative ways around this age old problem to express themselves and collaborate with others without being held back by lack of financial bounty. They were idealistic to the core. They were freedom loving, unique, independent, individualistic, self reliant, industrious, and passionate to the core. They were true to themselves, and true to the Muse. The Muse knows who loves her.

This is their story. They did it first. Watch it. Learn from it. But most of all, enjoy the music that these people created. After all, that's what it is all about - the music.
