For its time the characters are surprisingly nuanced in both writing and performance, and there are a number a great  scenes and terrific twists.  Sadly, and frustratingly the 2nd and third parts feel somewhat more hackneyed and clich&eacute;d, with  much more uneven acting, thinner characters, and overly melodramatic moments.

Lead actor Harry Baur is great throughout, which helps keep the later sections still quite  watchable, and throughout there is some terrific camerawork, including hand-held fights, and Dutch angled scenes.  Certainly this is a brave work on a film-making level.  But as the story focuses less and less on Jean Valjean and his various incarnations, and more and more on the world around him, that thrilling feeling of watching a masterpiece fades into just watching a very interesting and impressive piece of film history.  But - for those who are interested - that's still more than enough reason to see this well made and intelligent early adaptation.

The blu-ray transfer from the UK ""Masters of Cinema"" line is a solid step up from Criterion's already strong DVD.",1455235200,2,1190,5.119170984455959

If you cannot enjoy a movie with subtitles, then, this is NOT for you - but - if you can, the acting, sets, costumes, and the manner Victor Hugo's book's theme is presented is memorable.",1433030400,2,307,4.116666666666666
8613106,4,B00F8MJE66,"A few weeks ago TCM was running a `Les Miserables' marathon, where they gave us quite a few film versions of this classic story.  As a devoted fan of the stage musical, I really wanted to get my hands on (and set my sights on) more that this epic story had to offer.  The one I had most anticipated was this 1934 French adaptation, long hailed as the most faithful to Victor Hugo's original novel and long respected as the best adaptation ever filmed.  I must say, this was very good, but I'm hesitant to call it a classic.

First, I want to say that as an epic story film, Bernard's 1934 film works VERY well.  I think this is where my familiarity with the stage musical proves to be a hindrance in my acceptance of this version.  Where the stage musical remains emotionally crippling and strong in character development (I'll defend this argument in a minute), I felt as though this version of the story was emotionally detached and very thin on development of relationships.  In fact, outside of the cat and mouse between Valjean and Javert, this version pretty much set aside all development of individual pairings.  I felt no connection between Valjean and Cosette, no lovelorn believability between Marius and Eponine (she was basically thrown away completely) and no true love blossom between Marius and Cosette.  The development of the Thenardier's storyline felt overly long (and possibly over developed) while the relationships that mattered most got minimal development.

Now many may balk at this, for a bid complaint laid on the musical is the thin development of character, but this is where a song can really make a difference.  There is a lot of material to work with here.  Hugo's novel was nearly 2,000 pages long.  In order to condense and yet still compel, the musical uses strong development of emotion through lyrics to build relationships that don't have much time to develop.  So, when you strip out songs like `On My Own', `A Little Fall of Rain' and `Empty Chairs at Empty Tables' or even `Javert's Suicide' (a scene that is stripped from this film altogether and thus serves a major blow to his character development) you lose something special.

Still, as far as an epic film is concerned, this film manages to really sell the `story'.  It feels like a big story, and so it takes a more grand approach as opposed to the intimate approach of the musical.  The performances by most of the cast is very well done.  Harry Baur has some strong moments as Valjean, Florelle is heartbreaking as Fantine and Charles Vanel probably develops the most backstory as Javert.  The production design, costumes and cinematography add to the grand nature of the film.

I will say that for a film that is nearly five hours in running length, I was surprised at how easily it flowed, but sadly even with all that time the intimacy of the characters was left almost bare.",1357603200,,2879,4.708582834331337
