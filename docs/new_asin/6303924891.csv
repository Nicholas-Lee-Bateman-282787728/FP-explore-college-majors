734957,1,6303924891,"Living in Oblivion is like the cartoon character on Nickelodeon's CatDog, who has a dog's head at one end of it's body and a cat's head at the other and can therefore never decide which of its opposing instincts to follow.  The film, that begs for a plot, undulates insanely between being somewhat  amusing and utterly ridiculous.  I felt like pulling my hair out when I  realized that everything I watched was all a dream - TWICE!  As the movie  begins to climax and make some sort of meaningful sense, you are all of a  sudden staring at a black screen of rolling credits, feeling as if you  could honestly pull your hair out.  (Maybe you'll wake up and realize that  it's only a dream!)  The only thing right about this movie is its title.  ""Living in Oblivion.""  The bottom line here is that there are  too many ingredients in the plot and the story line is non-existant.  Turn  on Nickelodeon instead.

735235,3,6303924891,"Living in Oblivion is a film by Tom DiCillo that was made on a low budget. The actors weren't paid, and even put up their own money. In fact, anyone who put up any money eventually got a part. It is a parody of independent films and the Hollywood Twinkies who occasionally deign to participate in them, with Steve Buscemi playing director Nick Reve, James LeGros as leading man Chad Palomino, Dermot Mulroney as Wolf, the cameraman, and Catherine Keener as the actress Nicole Springer.

It is hard to get into Living in Oblivion because it is too much the inside joke. Nicole Springer is a really bad actress, and though it was probably a crack up to Catherine Keener and the cast, crew, and director Tom DiCillo, to those of us watching, it just seemed like bad acting.

Chad Palomino was even worse, and his ideas for blocking really sabotaged every scene he was in. He seemed to be a parody of Brad Pitt. Actually, Brad was supposed to play Palomino, but had to drop out due to scheduling conflicts. So, James LeGros has indicated that it was actually Patrick Swayze whose self-involved attitudes and mannerisms were lifted.

The two had just worked together in Point Break, which also starred Keanu Reeves as ex-football player turned FBI agent Johnny Utah trying to crack a case involving a gang of surfers who rob banks wearing masks of ex-presidents. Swayze is Bodhi, the leader of the gang of surfers. Bodhi is short for Bodhisattva. Bodhisattva is a term in the Buddhist religion meaning an enlightened being who, out of compassion, forgoes nirvana in order to save others. Bodhi means ""wakefulness"".

Chad: What did you call me?
Nick: You heard me. I called you a ""Hostess Twinkie ************,"" ************!
=================================

Anyway, once you get past the fact that the movie they are making is not very good and start paying attention to the real story, the behind the scenes shenanigans, you will begin to enjoy Living in Oblivion slightly more. A key thing to notice is that there are a lot of dream sequences. In fact, practically every scene is a dream sequence, with the possible exception of the dream sequence they are trying to film. Even the director's name, Reve, or Dream in French, is a clue.

735239,4,6303924891,"""Living in Oblivion"" (1995) - is a 91 minutes long low-budget independent movie about trials and tribulations during making a low budget independent movie called.. ""Living in Oblivion"". Writer-director Tom DiCillo made in 1991 a film called ""Johnny Suede"" starring a young and unknown at the time actor named Brad Pitt. ""Johnny Suede"" was a failure with both critics and viewers but an artist can learn from any experience however disappointing or devastating it is. DiCillo wrote a short story from his frustration and turned his experience into a smart, funny, playful, and highly enjoyable second feature ""Living in Oblivion"" that takes place during one day of shooting a low budget film. Photographed with the color-to-black-and-white transitions, ""Living in Oblivions"" has surreal, strangely poetic and amusing quality to it.

The cast is solid and consists of DiCillo's friends who are the regulars in his films. Steve Buscemi, the king of independent movies, in the rare starring role, plays Nick Reve, a long-haired, dedicated but frustrated director who in the moments of creative inspiration has to get back to earth and to deal with the tensions between his leading lady (Catherine Keener, before her star-making turn in ""Being John Malkovich"" but already a wonderfully talented beautiful and sexy actress) with whom he is silently in love and the male star, arrogant egotist Chad Palomino (James LeGros does an un-flattering but hilarious and quite accurate impersonation of the real life model for Chad). If these problems are not enough, there is eye-patch wearing sensitive leather-clad cameraman named Wolf (Dermot Mulroney) who went through a painful break-up right on the set. There is a great scene with an irritated dwarf Tito (Peter Dinklage) who was hired for a dream sequence and who hates dreams with the dwarfs in them: ""Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it? Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? No! I don't even have dreams with dwarfs in them. The only place I've seen dwarfs in dreams is in stupid movies like this!"" There is also a smoke machine that explodes every time when turned on...And to top it all, Nick's senile mother surprisingly shows up during the shot and eventually saves the dream sequence and the movie. That's what the mothers are for, aren't they?",1191801600,,2323,5.002583979328166
735240,5,6303924891,"This hilarious send-up is a both a loving tribute to the art of filmmaking and a farcical rendering of DiCillo's real-life experiences on the set of his previous indie breakout, ""Johnny Suede."" Never before has the absurdity and madness of trying to orchestrate the making of a movie been so nuttily and honestly captured. Keener, Mulroney, and Le Gros (whose character is modeled after Brad Pitt, star of DiCillo's debut) are fabulous, and Buscemi--scrawny, seemingly malnourished, and deeply agitated--has rarely been so funny or sympathetic. In reality a disaster movie, ""Oblivion"" is ingenious, briskly paced, and full of odd surprises.",1184284800,2,640,5.41

The reason I took the chance at all was due to the presence of Catherine Keener, one of our most overlooked and under-appreciated Hollywood actresses.  She once again did not disappoint, but the entire cast was extremely good.  You get a real education on the frustrations and challenges involved with making a low budget film.  Buscemi is also right on target as the stessed out director.  The Amazon reviews are for the most part positive about this film and for good reason.

The only difference is this film actually have stars and a budget, dispite the story is about low-budget filmmaking. I found this film hugely entertaining and realistically depicted and I can totally relate to what goes on throughout Oblivion. Yes, a lot of chaos and mishaps take place and in this movie.

Catherine Keener is great as a somewhat well-known actress who has worked on a Richard Gere movie, and now she's the star of a super low budget movie. She has very low confidence in herself as a actress, but the director(Buscemi) still believes in her. He miscast a well-known arrogant male lead who ended up having a one-nite-stand with Keener. The two lead have no chemistry working together on set, and they just can't stand each other anymore. The crew is also kind of nut case. From the cameraman(Dermot Mulroney) who has a disfunctional relationship with the 1st A.D., to the Boom operator who constantly crosses into frame during a take, to the actors not remembering the lines and so on.... It's just so funny. You just wonder how people can work on shows like this.

735319,5,6303924891,"""Living in Oblivion"" is one of those unassuming, low-circulation titles that make you wish your fellow citizens had more taste in cinema because then perhaps Hollywood would try making smarter films more often. Although, at the same time, you're almost glad they don't so you can hoard all these great movie experiences for yourself. The movie, in a nutshell, is about the agony and frustration of trying to make a low-budget film about a woman who was abused as a child and who is about to get married to someone she works with. Steve Buscemi, as the director, tries his damnedest to get the scenes to work, but instead is stymied at every turn: technical difficulties; incompetence by his crew; personal problems with his actors and the his crew; an obnoxious dwarf; and of course, past-its-expiration-date milk. It's these annoyances and hindrances that bring out the best scenes in the movie -- the ""real"" movie and the ""in-production"" movie. Buscemi gets to do a couple of his signature explosive outrages, like the Tasmanian Devil, only more coherent and quite a bit angrier (and less hair). Catherine Keener, one of the most underrated actresses in the business today, is smartly sensitive yet brutally honest with her feelings; not quite as sarcastically vicious as she was in ""Being John Malkovich"" or ""Death to Smoochy"". Those two actors were ostensibly the reason I originally saw the movie, but I bought the DVD due to the movie's originality, cleverness and humor as a whole. The special features include a few deleted scenes (including one great musical bit with the dwarf actor, Peter Dinklage), and a college film class interview with Dicillo and Buscemi. A screen gem that will have you alternately roaring with laughter and appreciating the way a movie can hit your emotions and your mind in such a sweet, unsuspecting way.",1126051200,14,1841,4.961165048543689

735321,5,6303924891,"I had the pleasure of viewing this in a cinema series run by my local college, and it is a must-see for anyone who loves film, makes films, or studies the process of filmmaking.  The story centers on a trio of scenes being filmed in a low-budget movie:  the first is a mock of an Lifetime Original movie, the second is a beautiful film noir/detective type scene, and the final scene being filmed is a intentionally freaky ""dream sequence"" that would be right up David Lynch's alley.  Each is a larger than life cariacature of the type of movie being portrayed, full of movie stereotypes.  You have an overly dramatic eye-patch wearing director of photography, an actress famous for a Richard Gere shower scene who is trying to keep her life and career together, a completely obnoxious leading man who tries to re-do every scene so it focuses more on him (he also preys on the women on the set), a small person who rails against the fact that he's being used to make a dream extra-freaky, and many more unforgettable characters.

The first third of this movie (in black & white) was originally filmed as a stand-alone piece, and it received such critical acclaim that DiCillo got everyone back together many months later to turn it into a full-length film.  You can see some differences between the first vignette and the following two.

The acting in this movie is superb, especially by Buscemi and Keener.  As I said, there are a plethora of movie set jokes that any film student or filmmaker would enjoy.  I've never been on a movie set, though, and I still found it hilarious, so the jokes are very accessible.",1124064000,4,1613,4.631578947368421
735322,4,6303924891,"Unlike Truffault's Day For Night, which examined the filming process of a high-profile movie, Living in Oblivion follows a lesser director, played by Buscemi, filming what looks like a pretty bad low-budget romantic drama.

There are many elements that stand out here. LeGros' portrayal of a macho self-absorbed actor rings truer than nature (and has shades of the satire of Zoolander), Keener is very good as a low-rent actress who gets that one great moment, and Buscemi is competent as always. Each part of the movie has a high point, including an embarassing scene where Keener listens in on a conversation between Buscemi and LeGros, a perfect moment missed by the cameraman, and a dwarf who makes pointed remarks about how the movies treat his stature.

Ironically, Living in Oblivion is itself a very low-rent movie, and it deals with this very well by restricting the environment. The important action is there and the acting is great. It really looks like a million dollar movie. Everything works. A high four stars.",1119312000,3,1025,4.988304093567251
735323,5,6303924891,"The Sundance film festival award winning comedy film depicts the process of making an independent/student film quite cleverly. Yet another ""A movie about making a movie"" sub-genre, written and directed by Tom DiCillo, I believe it his best film yet.

Sliced into three parts, the movie features the difficulties of film-making through the character's dreams. Yet, what is dream and what is real, you don't realize till they wake up.

Buscemi plays Nick Reve (Reve in french means Dream), the frustrated ""trying to get it right"" director, and you know by Murphy's Law that when he shouts ""ACTION!"" something will go wrong. It is amusing yet almost annoying as we get to be frustrated with Buscemi's character, and after that, it appears that it was just a dream.

The character of the arrogant actor Chad Palamino played by James LeGros, resembles Brat Pitt in appearance. It is said that Pitt was cast for this role, and since he was busy with another project, LeGros was chosen. Some say that Palamino's character might be Tom DiCillo's way of portraying Pitt's behavior on the set of his debut film ""Johnny Suede"" in 1991. Dicillo denies it.

The pearls of this film:

* The scene where Palamino shouts ""The only reason I took this part was because someone said you were tight with Quentin Tarantino!"", which is a role model for success in the indie film industry since Tarantino is the recent indie filmmaker that became a star director.

* The transition from monochrome to color and vice-versa as a difference between reality and film reality, a lovely gimmick.

* The 30 second ""Room Tone"" scene, where everybody is fantasizing about their life dream.

This film is a treat for filmmakers and in general a ""fun"" film. People who are not filmmakers will enjoy this film as well. The film is only 91 minutes and I wanted more.

Living in Oblivion (1995), written and directed by Tom DiCillo, who also did the earlier indie film Johnny Suede (1991), which starred a then not so well known actor named Brad Pitt (it's worth looking for, if you enjoy films of an extremely off-beat nature and want to see Brad Pitt sporting a coif the size of Rhode Island), stars Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs, Ghost World), and Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich).  Also appearing are Dermot Mulroney (About Schmidt), Danielle von Zerneck (La Bamba, My Science Project), and James LeGros (Phantasm II).

The film takes a humorous (to us, at least) look at hardships suffered upon Nick Reve (Buscemi) as he desperately tries to move forward his no budget film, focusing specifically on difficulties within his efforts to complete a couple of scenes of this seemingly ill-fated endeavor.  Problems arise in the form of boom microphones in the shot, temperamental talent (actors, to you and me) missing their cues and/or marks and flubbing or forgetting their lines, out of focus cameras, exploding Fresnel (pronounced ""fre-nel"") lights (these are focusable spotlights used in film, television, and theatre), noisy sets and just the general boobery of an inexperienced (i.e. cheap), inept, or uncaring crew.

DiCillo really presents a very funny story here, one obviously based on his own, personal experiences as an independent filmmaker, given the level of detail including the usage of various industry terms and stereotypes (many stereotypes are based on some degree of truth).  I thought all the actors appearing here did extremely well.  Buscemi is great and completely believable as the frazzled director, trying to conceptualize his ideas to film, placating the emotional erratic actors and dealing with his bumbling and equally unstable production crew.  Keener plays Nicole Springer, and actress whose career has seen better days (she's constantly referred to as that actress who had the shower scene in that Richard Gere movie) now stuck in independent movie hell, doubting her talents and abilities, usually requiring Nick to prop her up to continue.  LeGros is wonderful Chad Palomino, a patently transparent, superficial, Hollywood pretty boy `slumming' between more prominent roles who continuously disrupts his scenes with `suggested' improvements, usually involving some inane idea (""Hey, what if I was wearing an eye patch?"") or for himself to be more conspicuously displayed or highlighted within the scene, with Nick usually acquiescing in an effort to assuage the biggest name associated with his film.  Next there's Wolf (Mulroney), the completely pretentious and overly sensitive cinematographer (beret and all) who's constantly second guessing Nick's perception of how the scenes should be shot.  Last, but not least is Nick's AD (assistant director) Wanda, played by von Zerneck.  I've read where people thought her portrayal was over-acted, but I'd have to disagree.  If you've talked to anyone in the industry, they would probably tell you she acted exactly like an AD acts on the set of a film.  She may have exaggerated her role a little bit, but most likely only because DiCillo instructed her to...an AD is basically the director's liaison between the crew and sometimes the cast.  It's the AD's responsibility to communicate the director's instructions to all, ensuring everyone knows what's going on at all times, and also to be aware of everything that's happening on, and sometimes off, the set or location and keeping things on schedule.  They take care of all the details that would take away from the director doing his/her job of, well, directing.  I thought von Zerneck did very well, having to mollycoddle Nick while verbally whipping the crew, keeping them in line and on their toes.  The more time wasted, the more production costs rise.  The AD may not be the most popular person on the set, but they certainly serve a vital role.  Scenes to watch for...when Nick, completely frustrated with his inability to get a scene shot without some sort of interruption or snafu occurring, explodes in a tirade all over the crew, going into extensive detail with regards to his perception of each of their faults with respect as to why the production isn't going as smoothly as planned...the scene where Chad Palomino causes numerous stoppages in filming as he interjects his own thoughts about the scene, oblivious to irritated crew...finally, the scene involving a dream sequence, featuring one rather angry dwarf named Tito, who Nicole accidentally refers to more than once as `Toto'...Tito's objections to typecasting become apparent during a diatribe directed at Nick...'Have you ever had a dream with a dwarf in it? Do you know anyone who's had a dream with a dwarf in it? No! I don't even have dreams with dwarves in them!'....my advice?  If you're an independent filmmaker, be wary of how you use dwarves in your films.

The wide screen (1:85:1) picture provided on this DVD looks pretty good, and the audio is clear and crisp.  Special features include an interview filmed before an audience with director DiCillo and Buscemi worth watching if you enjoyed the film.  DiCillo outlines how the concept for the film came about, and Buscemi relates how he used his own directorial experiences in presenting the character of Nick, rather than basing off someone he's worked with...also included is a commentary track by DiCillo and a deleted scene.

735326,5,6303924891,"The talents I am talking about, of course, are the director Tom Di Cillo (""Moonlight in a Box""), subsequently infamous amongst the 'independent crowd', and the star, Steve Buscemi, who here once again proves that he is one of the most versatile character actors working today. The result of these two individuals working together, a comedy about making indie films called ""Living in Oblivion"", is one of the funniest and intelligent motion pictures of the 1990s.
  Most comedies nowadays either rely on dumb physical humor (celebrities: grimace, puke, punch, scream, trip'n'fall...) or on recycled situational gags (""Welcome to Mooseport""?!)  Genres like romantic comedies are sickeningly predictable (Richard Curtis/ Hugh Grant, anyone?) and sentimental. Spoofs like ""Scary Movie"" refer frequently to the more-successful slapstick of the Abraham/Zuckers' ""Airplane!"" (1980) or other earlier and funnier stabs at eccentric wit (Mel Brooks).
  What we have nowadays, ladies and gents, is Robert De Niro hamming it WELL up in the gruesomely exploitative ""Analyze That""; Eddie Murphy counting his paycheck in ""Daddy Day Care"" (where it's sporadically puked on by an annoying eight-year-old twerp) and ""The Haunted Mansion"" (where the paycheck should have been snatched away by Terence Stamp, who definitely got a lot less dough for the project than 'Axel', but tries a lot harder to save it from drowning in its own poop). It is a delight for us film-lovers to witness a comedy that is not desperate and/or indifferent in its attempts to make its audiences laugh, a comedy that is honest and certain of its genuinely witty concept, a comedy that is inspired rather than expired. ""Living in Oblivion"" is that kind of comedy.
  The film's 1995 theatrical release was unimpressive due to the picture's low-budget, and a central theme that withheld limited appeal. In my opinion, neither of those factors should prevent an average film-goer with a developed sense of wit to enjoy Tom Di Cillo's little masterpiece. Despite the fact that it focuses on the intricacies and hardships of independent filmmaking, the topic is just as accessible as any story contemporary Hollywood has to offer (""Bowfinger""...). One does not have to possess knowledge of all technical aspects of producing a motion picture to appreciate the film's humor.
  From the first nightmare dream sequence that Steve Buscemi's director has, the audience is hooked: everything goes wrong in each hilarious take, shot in color as opposed to the dream's black-and-white reality. Just when it threatens to stretch too long, the director wakes up (in color) and proceeds to his film shoot (in black-and-white). The dream sequence serves as an introduction of all the quirky crew members, including Dermot Mulroney's eye-patched DoP and Catherine Keener's emotional actress. The resulted nightmare is a premonition of events to get even more horrible in reality, supplemented by the established 'color switch' wackiness. And they do get worse.
  Slapstick may play a part in this film, but what makes it different from the forced obnoxiousness of Rob Schneider crap is how effortlessly it is handled by the cast, which makes the slapstick a natural consequence of built-up, razor-sharp insightful humor. The script avoids cliche and pathos - it keeps the film down in reality, which allows certain character exaggerations (the blonde arrogant film star...he is by far one of the funniest single characters in film history). Steve Buscemi shamelessly adopts yet another identity - where is his ""funny-lookin'"" thug from ""Fargo"", or the geeky Mr. Pink from 'Reservoir Dogs""? In ""Living in Oblivion"", Steve Buscemi runs the show as the exasperated director, who has to maintain absolute tranquility with his cast and crew. Buscemi's gradual loss of cool is something to marvel. As for the rest of the cast, it is simply flawless, each character a developed individual worthy of his own feature film.
  Tom Di Cillo's brilliant entrance into the filmmaking arena has everything a comedy needs: tight dialogue, witty actors who understand and aspire to their script, sublime direction that does not distract but has style, and, most importantly, the appreciation of its audience's expectations. ""Living in Oblivion"" respects humanity's need to laugh. I just wish that the rest of ""The Dream Factory"" wouldn't underestimate that need, and stop living in oblivion.",1079308800,6,4413,5.30515759312321

735383,5,6303924891,"Okay...yes, I'm biased.  I'm an aspiring film-maker.  Having a documentary and a short film under my belt, and currently in preproduction stages of my first feature, I found this film to be utterly hilarious in its depiction of indie film-making.  Why?  Because it's stunningly accurate.  Anyone who has ever made a film will laugh heartily at the seemingly absurd situations...because they've BEEN THERE, and they realize that those situations aren't so absurd...they're actually pretty common in film-making.  Film-making, particularly low-budget film-making, is hard work...sure, it's often fun...but more than anything, it's stressful and utterly frustrating.  Don't ask me how many pots of coffee or how many packs of cigarettes I went through just EDITING a 20-minute short...or how many times I spouted random and profuse profanity at the image on the screen simply because it refused to turn out right, despite the fact that, in the back of my mind, I was sure I MAKE it look right.  Don't ask how often actors blow their lines, or burst out laughing for no apparent reason...or how many times one has to reshoot a scene due to background noise, lighting problems, or the looming spectre of a continuity gaff.  If you've never made a film, you most likely have no idea what I'm talking about and may not realize that this film is as funny as it actually is.  If you're a film-maker, however, you're probably nodding your head right now...and maybe chuckling to yourself a bit.  If so, check out ""Living In Oblivion"" and get ready to laugh out loud.  It's your worst nightmare come true...but it's happening to some OTHER film-maker...so it's okay to laugh.",995673600,3,1664,5.010909090909091
