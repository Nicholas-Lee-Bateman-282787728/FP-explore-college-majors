7608255,5,B01AT7SNYI,"Wow. Did I really write my original review of this anime 12 years ago? A lot has changed since then, but some things never change. I've already bought this anime twice. The first release looks like crud but was the only option for a while. The second release looks better but has some aliasing and smudging that makes it look like you're watching through a layer of petroleum jelly. So how does this release compare? Well I'll talk about that in my revised review, but I think in honor of this amazing anime I'll make a ""Special Edition"" of my own review. Onward to the action!

What happens when an unstoppable bounty hunter fights an unkillable monster? You hold onto your chair.

I might be mistaken, but I think this is the holy grail of anime sci-fi action. But what makes for a good sci-fi action show? To me it has always seemed to be a combination of a likable character, excellent fight choreography, a sweet soundtrack, cool weapons, atmosphere, suspense, and action, action, action. Whether set in ancient China ala Forbidden Kingdom and Crouching Tiger, the modern day as in White House Down or Aliens, or the future as in The 5th Element, The Matrix, or the latest Star Wars flick, you need a nice balance of humor to keep it from getting too serious, pacing that keeps you engaged, music and film techniques that build tension, and suspense action sequences that make you laugh with glee at the awesome and unexpected.

Iria is a Defining Action Anime

First of all, this OVA has some of the slickest presentation I've ever seen in an anime. The opening, the closing, the music, the way the shots are composed...10 out of 10. The animation and artwork are also absolutely top-notch. Looking at the backgrounds in this show made me think of some of the concept art we sometimes see in the opening or closing of a show or film but almost never in the actual show. How to describe the style? It's a bit like the very best art in Outlaw Star, but kicked up a notch or three. Everything has a kind of oriental/Star Wars: A New Hope style to it (from people wearing old battle armor with cloaks over them to cities and transportation that looks like it's made of stuff found in a futuristic junk-yard).

As far as characters go, the main one in this show is really likable and mighty cool. Iria wears ceramic body armor and carries more futuristic implements of war than you can shake a light-saber at. And that's in addition to the speeder-type transports that can jump into hyper-space, personal energy shields, and the holographic fighting simulators (and we're just getting started). Cool stuff.

The fights in this show are so good you have to see them for yourself to understand why they stand out from the rest of the genre. Some people might get tired of seeing our hero fight the same villain for hours (between various other confrontations and escapes), but personally I love it. The fights just get more and more intense as the story progresses. The creepy indestructible creature called Zeiram simply refuses to die. During her fights with the monster, Iria will do all kinds of martial-arts moves, fire weapons until they run out of ammo and grab another one only to keep blasting, dodging, running, and doing all kinds acrobatics to hold her own with the monster. Very slick.

Of course Iria is also an extremely likable person, and as we slowly learn more and more about her and how she came to be a hunter we come to care about her and sympathize with her revenge. Iria may be tough-as-nails, and cool-as-ice, but in the end she's still a girl with a little bit of growing up to do, and she's not out to prove anything or hurt anyone, just to destroy the monster that threatens to kill everyone it comes close to and save her brother. Iria is one of my favorite anime heroes and one of the best female protagonists I can recall from anything.

The pacing of this anime is fantastic. It starts out at fast, and the tension just keeps building until by the end of the final episode we just know that either Iria or the monster is going to die. The desperation in the battle is palpable, and the viewer is on the edge of their seat. I love this anime. If you like action, you probably will too. But how, you ask, does this release fair compared to the previous releases?

The second release of Iria had surround sound, but I have no idea how it sounded in comparison to the original stereo mix. This new release is just straight-up stereo sound in English and Japanese, and the sound is very clean to my ears. I haven't dove into the Special Features because for whatever reason I didn't find the interviews all that interesting the first-time around. It's the OVA that interests me, and the reason I bought this release was a hope that the picture would be superior to the lackluster transfer in the last two releases.

Fortunately this release is quite obviously based off a high definition master used in a Japanese Blu Ray. This release looks like it was animated yesterday. The gorgeous artwork and animation is absolutely crystal clear. Quite frankly it looks like this is a Blu Ray itself. I bought the original DVD release and the second release and yes, this release is most definitely worth the cost for improved picture alone. There's also some new subtitles that I like better than the original. These have less swearing and they seem to be reworked to aid audience understanding rather than erring on the side of literal translation (like the new subtitles on the Blu Ray of The Seven Samurai). Overall I like them better than the 2nd release and MUCH better than the original. If you like lots of swearing in your Japanese translations I suppose the new subs might be a downside to you.

In addition, the drab artwork on the case has been replaced with a beautiful slip-cover and a reversible inner cover with some beautiful artwork. Discotek was in charge of this release and it shows. It's the definitive release of this anime by far.

My recommendation? If you like action anime and have never seen Iria before, buy this release immediately. If you love Iria and have bought the previous releases, buy it immediately.",1459468800,46,6155,4.610958904109589
7608256,4,B01AT7SNYI,"A short but charming little series that has really sunk into obscurity over the years. It's a spin-off of a science-fiction movie simply titled ""Zeiram"" The OVA doesn't have too much to offer in the complexity of the characters, but where it really shines is the unique world and setting. A space-age future with advanced technology is presented, but everything still has a very old-world look. Decorative beads and primitive stone buildings intermingle with the futuristic inventions. The show is worth at least one viewing just to see the unique world. Other than that it's a somewhat predictable show that has likable atmosphere and characters, and has a nostalgic charm to it. The dub is also surprisingly tolerable given how long ago it was made. Iria is a series with not a whole lot to offer, but nothing bad either.",1458518400,6,823,4.885714285714286

8748281,5,B01AT7SNYI,"This is a classic anime, and one of two shows that got me started on what has become a lifelong passion.

Iria is a junior bounty hunter, who tags along with her mentor and older brother, Gren, on a dangerous mission in space. Nothing goes as planned and Iria ends up seeking revenge while holding onto hope for her brother. With a powerful company trying to cover up its actions, a complacent government, and an ancient evil from the nether corners of space Iria has her work cut out for her.

The one issue I had was with the packaging which was best described as a construction paper ravioli. See the attached pictures.",1484524800,6,622,4.495575221238938

8748286,1,B01AT7SNYI,"Iria is a chore to sit through. The art direction and character designs are interesting enough on their own, but this style is fairly dated by today's standards and isn't likely to appeal to anyone but the most old school of otaku.
Bearing this in mind the art direction does little in the way of making the story any more interesting or the quality of the animation itself any better. The story is bare bones and poorly explained. Things just sort of happen at a breakneck pace and its hard to keep track. The OVA is a prequel to the Zeiram films and if we're being perfectly honest, either watch this, or the films. Don't watch both. Because Iria's story feels like an after thought of the Zeiram production. Hardly explaining anything and only creating plot holes in the over all series narrative. Episodes are drawn out, boring and forgettable. The universe seems like it could be interesting, but Iria does little in the way of capitalizing on that. Unless you're some kind of anime masochist, I'd pass on this one.",1469318400,2,1020,4.640883977900552
