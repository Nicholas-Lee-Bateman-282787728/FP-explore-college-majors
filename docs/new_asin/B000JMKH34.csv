It's not about a particular coach, player or game strategy.  It's about a special ""magic"" that connects all of the players and coaching staff to the positive energy of the fans to create a force-field of momentum.  Of course, there have been star coaches, star players and many startling moments, but it's the special ""Sooner Magic"" that makes O.U. Football one of the nation's best teams, year-in-and-year out!
