8137636,3,B000H8RZP8,"Because the disease runs in my family, this gave me very little new info.  However, it clearly links obesity with diabetes and this may motivate many to lose weight.  The work spoke of both types of diabetes.  The work said, ""Diabetes could lead to stroke, amputation, or blindness,"" but it never showed people with those conditions.  Thus, it wasn't trying to shock the viewers in a way that it could.  The usual host of this series is a commentator instead this time.  They use the term ""pre-diabetic"" when I had heard that experts are trying to retire that idea.  This work may be designed for viewers who know absolutely nothing about this widespread illness.",1199750400,,663,4.7631578947368425
