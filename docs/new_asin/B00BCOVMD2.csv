5578930,5,B00BCOVMD2,"Ordered this video because I was a fan back in the 80's/90's and tried to never miss a show.  Quality acting, top-notch writing and drama with some comedy relief.  Highly recommend for someone seeking television in it's heyday.",1368144000,2,227,4.947368421052632

5578934,3,B00BCOVMD2,"Too much about lawyers personal lives (baby adoption) ..not enough law stories.

5578936,4,B00BCOVMD2,One of my favorite 80's series. The picture quality gets better with each of the 1st 3 seasons. I wish they would release 4-8 in the USA (they're only available in the UK as far as I can tell). I can play R2 PAL; but I can't afford the prices. I really do want the entire series. Shout Factory are you listening? I don't think I'm alone in that wish!,1464566400,,350,4.014285714285714

5578942,5,B00BCOVMD2,"I'm sorry that there are only three official seasons available on DVD.  I see that later seasons are available on region 2 but I don't want to take a chance on them not playing on my DVD player, or having something of substandard quality.  I would love to get the remaining seasons.

L.A. Law is so entertaining. Intelligently written, with fleshed-out, believable characters and believable plots. Season 3 continues with its character development and the actors become more stable and comfortable in their roles. The episodes do a good job of trying to portray both sides of the cases that are up for trial. All in all it's an interesting series and I'm glad that at least the first three seasons are available on DVD.",1445817600,4,719,4.736

5578948,5,B00BCOVMD2,"LA Law may get too personal at times, but the cases are great.  I wish they wold bring this back as I am sick and tired of thoser more recent programs where filming is done in the dark, the action is too fast-paced, and there is too much strobe lighting.",1434499200,,254,4.08

Please eject the disc. Playback is not authorized in your region."" To top things off, there was no receipt or  return shipping label enclosed in the package.

Then, some ads say REGION FREE, BUT the DVD's & packaging say REGION 2 PAL. Then again, they DO work on my ordinary DVD player here in the USA. CONFUSING? YOU BET!!

8566293,3,B00BCOVMD2,"This is a review of the discs and not the series (10 out of 5 stars), which lives on as among the best that television has everr had to offer. In watching season 3 we've not some real issues with the audio at times. On several occasions the volume has suddenly fallen noticeably enough to require turning up the volume. Even after that, though, the dialogue was kind of chopped and muffled and discerning what the characters were saying was a challenge. We'll still finish this season, though, (our last of three), because we so loved this Bochco series. We're just sorry that seasons beyond number three aren't available for people in the US, though they can be had for other parts of the world. That's something I really don't understand, because I know scores of the remaining seasons would sell in the US.",1530748800,,809,4.625
8566294,4,B00BCOVMD2,"This presents the full season with each episode approximately 48 minutes. No special features and the film looks very old and needs to be cleaned up. Some of the great guest stars include James Earl Jones, Wayne Tippit, Michael Cavanaugh, Renee Jones, Peter Turgeon, Charles  Lane, and Lew Ayres.

Some of the storylines this season: Roxy tries to get divorced, Stuart & Anne try to adopt, Leland is up for a judgeship, Abby opens her own practice and kills one of her first clients, Mickey and Grace kiss other people, and Benny gets a girlfriend.",1524009600,,548,4.757894736842105
