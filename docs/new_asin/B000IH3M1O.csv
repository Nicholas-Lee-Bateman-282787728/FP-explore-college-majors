8145378,4,B000IH3M1O,"Very enjoyable fast-moving comedy with colorful characters!  I've had trouble finding much to watch in Portuguese on Netflix, and am glad I splurged on this one.  (It's in Portuguese, no subtitles.)  This was made only a few years after my year of living in Brazil, so the culture rang true to my experience--though this is a silly romp through it!  There is actually an important message here about how you might find a great match if you don't stick too rigidly to your ""dream"" mate.  It is also a spot-on satire about the divided classes in Brazil.  My only complaint is too little screen time for my favorite, Marcos Palmeira!

Optima comedia, muito divertida.",1473897600,,664,4.771929824561403
