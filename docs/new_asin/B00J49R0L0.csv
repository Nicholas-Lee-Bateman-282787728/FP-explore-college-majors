8647988,5,B00J49R0L0,"Definitely the best James Bond movies ever made. They (wisely) steered away from the comic book fantasy of the old James Bond movies from the 70's and 80's, and made something gritty, realistic, and just plain fun to watch. I have nothing against the older JB movies, though. We wouldn't be where we are today without them. But after the illogical gadgets, cheesy one-liners, and ridiculously far-fetched villains, we were in need of a franchise reboot. Now if we could only get Chris Nolan to direct a few of these...",1417996800,3,518,4.766666666666667
8647989,2,B00J49R0L0,"The 007 James Bond series has taken on a dark air with the Daniel Craig collection.  I really do not care for him in the role as James Bond and the light heartedness in a few scenes of the previous actors are gone.  Everything is bleak, extremely violent and lacks the finesse that Pierce Brosnan and Sean Connery brought to the screen is now gone.  I really think that the current director and writers have let down the true James Bond fans.  I really do miss Pierce Brosnan.",1414022400,,476,4.375
