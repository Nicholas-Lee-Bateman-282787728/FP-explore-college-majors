8159262,5,6303101771,"'Miles Ahead: The Music of Miles Davis' is a 1986 PBS documentary which has all but disappeared over the last ten years or so.  This program is a must see for Miles fans, and desperately needs to be released on DVD.  As far as I know, 'Miles Ahead' was last aired on PBS several years ago as part of a tribute to Miles, which also featured the hour long ""Miles at Montreux"" 1991 concert, where Quincy Jones conducted a big band playing the Gil Evans arrangements behind Miles.  I was fortunate to record both programs, as they have never been released to DVD, and are hard to locate on VHS.

'Miles Ahead' is a fantastic 60 minute documentary about the music of Miles Davis, and an absolute must for Miles fans.  Unlike Sony's 'The Miles Davis Story' documentary, it focuses less on the man's personal life and more on his great musical accomplishments.

What I really like about this program is the way they let the concert footage play out longer than the usual documentary, where short music clips are frequently interrupted by narration.  There are extended clips of Miles with the first and second quintets here.  The Second Great Quintet in particular is showcased heavily via footage from the amazing 10/31/67 Stockholm concert (another DVD release I'd love to see).  There are also several minutes of concert footage from Miles' 1986 band, and interviews with Miles himself, as well as some of his great collaborators like Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Keith Jarrett and Gil Evans.

Will PBS or someone else please consider re-releasing this great program to DVD?",1127606400,3,1572,4.810408921933085
