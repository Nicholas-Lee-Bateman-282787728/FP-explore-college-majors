8264432,4,B00170ID1K,"Female Slaves Revenge in the beginning talks about world peace and mans inhumanity to man.  We then hear tribal beats while seeing African animals roaming around.

A narrator comes on and talks about a nation suppressed and dominated by white slave traders.  The wealth and trade were taken by the slaves.  The war brought problems.  Most white land owners had to leave the countries and the land had to be given to the slaves.  The slaves were now free.  This is the story of a greedy evil murderous land owner who disobeyed orders and refused to leave the country.  He refused to surrender his wealth and possession.  The head mistress of the mansion becomes the queen ruler of the household and draws around her 9 maids, mistresses and servants.  Together they seize and control the evil land owner and form a court to try him for his crimes.

We see tribal women dancing and homes exploding that really captures the cheesy 80's vibe that this movie may or may not be intentionally going for.  We hear about a war that has broken out.  One army has met resistance and casualties are heavy as the fighters try to push through a border without water.  The narrator informs us that as war dissipates and lives have been given to achieve freedom the new order sets the task to rebuild the country.

A man says he owns the plantation and isn't leaving to his girlfriend, who's packing her bags and leaving herself.  She tells the guy to get out now that he can but he says he ain't leaving for nothing.  The taxi driver tries to convince the woman to encourage her husband to leave but she says it's his choice so let's go!

The man yells at his slaves.  He looks like Willie Nelson so we'll refer to him as such.  A military man wants to send out paperwork to each household.  Willie beats on a slave woman with a rope across her back in his back yard.  Another slave begs to show the woman some compassion but he says ""You want more of the same?"" and ""You want compassion?  I'll show you compassion!  Get up to my bed and I'll show you compassion!""  Willie tells his friend that if she tries to run away again, take his gun and shoot her down.

One slave says she can't take it much longer, but her friend mentions a woman's jewelry will soon be theirs.  We now see several women in a room celebrating grabbing money.  Willie drinks in his room and plays with his gun.  The female slaves sneak up behind him and smack him across the face.

We now see a message that says ""As authorized by the new order, Wateesa, head servant of the mansion, forms a court, selects nine jurors and begins the trial of the landowner.  Other slaves were welcomed to observe.""

Wateesa tells Willie to refer to her as Her Majesty for the rest of the trial and for now on.  She says ""Your escape from the country was totally unacceptable.  You took your wealth and possessions from us which is more than we could bare.  It became necessary to take laws in our own hands.""  This court has been assembled to determine his fate.  Wateesa reminds him he's a prisoner now.

""He will be judged accordingly in this courtroom.  You have kept my people in slavery all their lives"" Wateesa adds.  ""Why are you doing this?"" says Willie.  ""I've been taking care of you since you were a child!""  The women make him drop to his knees.  ""You stood by while all the treasury was happening.  While our country slipped into tyranny you and your people were all that was left"".

Willie's responsible for 37 deaths of Wateesa's people.  Slaves were traded away to other places away from their people.  The people were trampled to death in their attempt at freedom.  Willie says ""It wasn't my fault!"" but Wateesa says ""You will be tried for your personal injustices and cruelties.  if you are found to be guilty, you will be executed in a manner they choose to be fitting"".

We're introduced to the jury.  One woman says she'd rather have been elected as Willie's executioner instead of his spokesman.  The jury has decided Willie will lie on the floor and the women will press his body through the floor.  He deserves to be treated as dirt beneath them.  They press their feet against the man's chest and point a gun in his mouth.

The ladies determine an oath.  Wateesa says to swear the things they say happened with their own eyes and not the eyes of others.  A woman says her mother was humiliated by this man and she was born in a field.  She had no life of her own from sunrise to sundown.  She was beaten half to death by Willie.  She was so scared to speak out against him.  She says she would slave him and cut off his private parts.  She'd work and whip him over and over.  Meanwhile the other ladies of the jury kick him in the ribs.

Another lady of the jury mentions that somebody connected to Willie was taken to him to become a slave.  She worked and slaved for him yet hated him for the murder of her uncle.  She'd whip him until the whip was red with blood.  ""I hate your guts!  When my arm gives out from whipping you I want my sisters to take over!""  one woman wants Willie sentenced to death.  Another girl says she saw this man kill a 19 year old woman because she wanted his body.  He also burned a boy.

The next lady says he's an enemy of her country and her people.  His sins are unforgivable and she says ""A tooth for a tooth and a life for a life"".  A woman says she objects to killing and spilling his bleed.  She says Willie's not a totally evil person and saw a time when he was a warm and caring person. The lord might make them accountable if they take justice in their own hands.  One woman disagrees and says Willie's a pig lying under her high heels and he's the reason for the near death of these ladies.

""If we don't bring this man to justice, who will?""  The other woman continues to defend him.  ""We must not have his blood on our hands"".  The other girl seems to agree ""We must not have blood on our hands... but under our feet!""  Boy these ladies kick and step all over this guy!  The one woman says it's up to her that justice is done.  Wabeesa says she represents the law of this land.  They shall feast on Willie's crimes and come to a conclusion on his fate tomorrow.  He begs them not to leave him like this.

While the women dance outside, later that night they come back into the room and kick Willie around some more.  One woman whips him hard for every month she kept him a slave.  At least she's not whipping him for each day!  Imagine how much more painful that would've been.

They drag Willie to the basement and dance outside again.  One woman demands that the man at least get a sip of water and the lady guarding Willie's door reluctantly agrees.  She visits Willie and asks God for forgiveness.  He insists he's innocent and doesn't need forgiveness.  She gives him the drink.  Uh oh!  She say ""It's taking its toll and is working nicely- the poison is working nicely!""  She reveals her face and says she's no nun.  She kicks Wille around and says he prosecuted her people and her jury will find him guilty.  While she kicks him hard he says he should be treated like a dog and this is what he deserves for tormenting her people.  Wow, about time you realize your wrongdoings!  Willie says he feels guilty for killing her brothers and sisters.  She says if her fellow jurors don't kill him she'll come back and finish the job.  Wow this guy gets kicked a lot!  When she returns upstairs she thanks her friend for giving her the chance to show him some compassion, lol.

While the women put make up on, Willie insists he treated them well and wonders what they're about to do.  Why kick him of course!  One woman says she'll make sure he never hurts his sisters again.  The women walk across his chest in their pointy high heels.  I thought they were aiming for his belly button but no.  They step close to his belly button though.  One woman continues to have flashbacks of Willie's horrible mistreatment of women.

It's fate day!

They drag his body upstairs.  One lady insists an example has to be made of Willie for those who disobey people and their land.  He eventually says he'll give them money if they let him go but they don't care about that.  They care about tormenting this man as much as they can.

Willie says he gave them shoes, money, jewelry.  Watessa says the people need to vote.  If he's found not guilty he'll be set free with all his possessions returned to him.  However if he's found guilty he will die and will be executed according to the witness.

Willie begs for whiskey so a girl pours whiskey in his mouth.  Wateesa says she assumes people will cast their ballots as their hearts have spoken to them.  She reminds Willie they are the judge, jury and executioner in his case.  He insists on trying to offer them money but Wateesa says she's not interested in money.  She's only interested that justice be done.  ""You can have it all!"" he cries.

Willie says she has no authority to do any of this.  They have his weapons and the chains are cutting his wrist.  Surprisingly one vote is not guilty.  The rest are guilty so yeah, it's time to kill this slave owner scumbag.  He won't stop telling the women he has money and jewelry.  Nobody cares man!  Wateesa repeats herself too by mentioning she's the judge, jury and executioner and justice will be done.

Wateesa has selected ways in which he will die.  Number 1.  Kneel before Wateesa blindfolded then be shot by former slaves.  Nah, he won't see it coming!  Number 2.  He will be hanged by each and every one of the jury with a rope around his neck.  Number 3.  He will be stabbed again and again and again until his blood is drained from his body.  Number 4.  He will be trampled to death under the high heels of the women jurors and his remains will lie open on the bare ground.  I personally hope when this ballot is cast it's option 4.  It just sounds like the coolest one!

The votes are in.  Wow, 6 votes for trampled to death (plus my vote so that makes 7!)  That is the most original one after all.  Let's face it- we've seen hangings and stabbings a thousand times.  We need a more original one.  Willie says everything the women are wearing belonged to his wife.

Sharpen your shoes ladies!  The man cries ""This isn't right, you can't sentence me!""  He screams ""You're all murderers!""  Wateesa speaks.  ""Now ladies of the jury.  Take your position.  On the count of 3 drive your spikes deeply and with a revenge"".

Dang, this is awesome!  Nonstop stomping!!  All the ladies stomping at the same time.  I actually thought they'd jump on top of him while stomping but they all stand around him instead.  When they're done they throw his shoes on his chest and walk away.  Justice is served!  The one woman covers her child's eyes.

""The remains of the landowner were carried to the fields to seep into the soil of the earth as so ordered by Wateesa's court"".  A very catchy and sad gospel song during the credits.

Despite all the criticisms of this film it does one thing amazingly well.  It actually has an interesting court room discussion!  The intensity and anger these women feel towards their former slave owner really put all those court dramas you see on TV to shame.  The acting is great I think.  It's the low budget way the film was recorded and the sound quality that's an abomination.  I enjoy this movie.  I feel silly for not going in realizing Female Slaves Revenge is about slaves.  I expected something else for some reason but no, this is clearly about a group of slave women getting their revenge.  A hard movie to watch perhaps given the torture, but it's worth it.",1502236800,,11596,4.3923512747875355

8264435,1,B00170ID1K,"Originally released as ""Apartheid Slave-Women's Justice,"" ""Female Slaves Revenge"" (or ""Female Slaves' Revenge,"" depending on which packaging you buy) is as bad a piece of garbage as you are ever likely to see. I generally like Mikels' wacky low-budget movies (e.g. ""The Worm Eaters,""""Girl in Gold Boots,"" and ""The Astro-Zombies"") with their otherworldly plots, convoluted storylines, and abysmal acting, but I draw the line at ""Female Slaves Revenge,"" a film with absolutely no redeeming values, social, cinematic, or otherwise. In this one Ted is a quadruple threat, as he not only wrote it, produced it, and directed it, but he stars in it as well. If you elect to go against my advice and watch this, brace yourself, you're in for a really unpleasant ride.

The box bills this film as ""Ted V. Mikels' Cult Classic"" but there is nothing classic (or classy) about this movie, cult or otherwise. When you put the disc in the player you are immediately confronted with the most primitive menu in DVD history. If you foolishly decide to watch the movie, the appalling production values start immediately with Ted standing up and bloviating about how the picture deals with ""man's inhumanity to man"" (really,) after which we get a lot of stock footage of rhinos and elephants interspersed with a map of Chad. There is a really (really) long and ponderous scrolling written explanation setting up the film, and some equally plodding narration: ""The events you are about to witness could actually have taken place."" Well that certainly has the sound of authority. Essentially, in an unnamed country in Africa, landowners have been mistreating slaves under apartheid, but a revolution has occurred making the slaves the masters and vice-versa. Ted, who is only known as ""Landowner"" throughout the film, stays behind when most of the former oppressors (including Ted's wife) have the good sense to leave the country.

It will not surprise you to discover that this is simply a revenge picture masquerading under the veneer of an anti-apartheid film. The former slaves quickly capture Ted, and despite abundant stock footage of flamingoes and the like, take him to the least Africa location imaginable. They take him to what looks like a small and cheap apartment in Culver City, though I'm betting it was in Las Vegas, Ted's base of operations. At any rate, the fact that they sit on chairs that look like they came from Pier One, and chain Ted to a dresser (?) where he is forced to lie prone on the orange sculptured carpet under the clearly African ceiling fan mounted on a textured ceiling, near the very African bent mini-blinds, all of which adds to the magical illusion that they are in deep within Africa. Ted has little dialogue, and simply writhes around on the floor in his trademark unbuttoned shirt with decorative horn necklace saying things like ""You can't do this!"" and ""I'll give you money"" while intermittently begging for his life.

The acting is absolutely the worst I have ever seen anywhere, from Ted's groveling to the ten former slave women who put him on trial. There are scant few interesting or enlightening flashbacks, but lots (and lots and lots) of shrill screaming at Ted from the women. Occasionally a title card with important textual readings comes up to fill us in on what's happening with the plot as it is otherwise fairly incoherent; those are the best parts of the movie. This film is so bad that you will be tempted to stop it in several places and watch it in parts. My advice is to take the ""Band-Aid"" approach (i.e. rip it off all at once in a hurry) and just get the suffering over with.

The kangaroo court is overseen by Ted's former slave Wateesa (Jennifer Dove, who is billed both as ""Wateesa"" and ""Wateesah"" in the credits not more than five seconds apart) who insists Ted address her as ""Your Majesty"" although her formal title is apparently ""Queen-Mistress Wateesah."" To ensure impartiality all nine jurors are also Ted's former slaves, with Butra (Rachel Powell) acting as the prosecutor. Lots of hammy exhortations and accusations are hurled at Ted. We get it: he was a bad man. The plot devolves to simply yelling at and kicking Ted for an hour. That's it. The question is how is this more just or humane than his actions when he was the landowner? Surely mistreatment of one person by another is unacceptable regardless of who is abusing whom.

All of a sudden from out of nowhere someone says ""we shall call for the feast of the elder's crown"" and the film shifts to a picnic and some ridiculous ""tribal"" dancing at what looks to be a community center in Las Vegas. This is simply painful to watch. During the time of the elder's crown shindig several of the women visit Ted for some quality one-on-one kicking and screaming time. In other words more of the same with fewer cast members present. In the most ludicrous subplot in the movie Sister Mary Ellen, a nun, brings Ted a drink. We know she's a devout religious figure due to four subtle traits: first, she starts by talking to Ted about prayers and forgiveness; second, she is wearing a nun's habit which in this case is represented by a black sweater and a white handkerchief on her head; third, she gives Ted poison to drink; and fourth, she too starts screeching at Ted about how he tormented her people. So, in other words, she is actually ""Imposter Sister Mary Ellen."" Believe it or not, that is actually how Patrease Ashley is credited at the end. Honest.

To say that this film ends as you expect it to (Ted found guilty) underscores the pain of getting to the end. This is certainly one of the worst films I have ever sat through, and I found it almost impossible to endure, not because the troubling material of apartheid policies was uncomfortable, but precisely because such an important issue was treated in such an inappropriate manner. Ted gets sentenced to death by trampling by high-heeled former slaves while bongos play in a loop on the soundtrack. Ted plays bongos, so maybe he recorded them. If so, they are his best contribution to the project.

This whole mess is ill-conceived and executed. The cast consists of nobody you've ever heard of (other than Ted V. Mikels) but includes Sandra Young as Belahsa, Zia Brunner as Sellahlie, Helen Sellers as Raybutta, Delvera Spears as Etrosef (the only one to vote ""not guilty"" and point out that Ted had often treated them well as their master,) Viola Brown as Petrinah, Starlita Burton as Fleurlilli, Beverly Spears as Wishtofti, and Suyen Mosely as Suhya. Mosely is also credited as the ""Vocalogist,"" while F. Abayomi Goodall gets the credit for ""Dancer-Choreographer Victory Dance,"" and Ulysses Palrose gets another dancing and African drum credit. The amateurish closing credits roll while the originally titled song ""Anti-Apartheid"" plays, although the sound is so poorly recorded and reproduced that you will be unable to understand most of the lyrics. I'm sure they were very moving, much like the final line of the credits: ""Special Thanks John 3:16"" which is, of course, ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life."" That is a beautiful and moving scripture but has nothing in particular to do with this movie, certainly nobody in this film exhibits any compassion or forgiveness, and, in fact, go out of their way to do the exact opposite.

""Female Slaves Revenge"" is an absolutely odious abomination. A sensitive and serious exploration of apartheid has all the makings of a moving and sobering film, but this has neither the sensitivity or gravitas to deal with an extremely difficult subject, and I absolutely could not recommend this film less. While I normally like Mikels' work, this is way beyond the boundaries of acceptable taste, not to mention good filmmaking. Avoid this at all costs.",1272326400,3,7864,4.824314306893996

8264437,1,B00170ID1K,"The top of the box for this DVD states that this is a cult classic.""Cult classic"". Maybe, we need to examine just what exactly a ""cult classic"" is. I always thought a cult classic was an underground movie that never was accepted by the mainstream but was reverred and celebrated by a select few. Cult classics are often too extreme or weird for the mainstream but are usually well made and have original and entertaining premises. But maybe I'm wrong because ""Female Slaves Revenge"" does not fit my critera for a cult classic. Its an extremely bad movie, its not entertaining, its poorly made, poorly acted and the plot is disjointed. Nobody likes this movie not even a guy who enjoys cult classics like myself. This movie belongs in another catagory called garbage. And thats exactly where I will put it, in the garbage.",1221436800,6,821,4.708333333333333
