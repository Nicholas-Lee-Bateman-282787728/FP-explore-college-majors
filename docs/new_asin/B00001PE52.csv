8214354,5,B00001PE52,"This is a movie that has it all, chilling and funny at the same time. These actors make this quirky story work, and after one viewing, you'll want to see it again. It was re-released as ""Highway Hitcher"" to try to find an audience, but that is not even an apt title for this piece of work. Don't miss this, under either banner!",1004313600,2,327,4.2063492063492065
