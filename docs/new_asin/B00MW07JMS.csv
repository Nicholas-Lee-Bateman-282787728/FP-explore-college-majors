6602681,4,B00MW07JMS,I love this tv show and Terence Hill is a legend. What I don't like is the quality of the dvd. The video format is very very bad. Unbelievable how they destroied such a great product!,1423353600,,183,4.111111111111111
6602682,5,B00MW07JMS,"This is SET 8 NOT season 8, really part of season 4 and 5. Had I seen the previous reviewer' review, I would have realized this, HOWEVER because it is ADVERTISED as SEASON 8 I did not feel I needed to review the show I love. MY MISTAKE.
 Still a good show, but I really wanted to see season 8 where Patrice maries the captain. This is BEFORE he ever arrives with the previous captain.
Also if you cannot find the next SETS on Amazon go to MHZ Network to order AND they are going to start a streaming service for all their international mysteries:http://mhznetworks.com/about/mhz-choice-faq To bad Amazon could not get the rights to stream.",1422403200,4,639,4.556521739130435

Perfect it you want to brush up on your Italian, but there are English subtitles so even if the language doesn't appeal to you, you will still enjoy this show. The characters are very believable; they start to feel like people you know. The acting is outstanding. Good humor. Good story lines.",1440201600,,347,4.4375
