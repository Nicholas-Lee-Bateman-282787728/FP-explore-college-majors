8147892,4,B000IZJR0Q,"Haven't seen the movie in entirety but I bought this DVD for the songs I use to hear in childhood & nostalgia.  Also as a boy liked action and fighting and not knowing what Dus Numberi meant, I thought Manoj Kumar was so cool wearing a '10' on his shirt all the time and everyone waiting for him to save the day as if a Super Hero. Story is classic from movies of 1970's.  Hero is wronged in childhood by villain and is orphaned and grows up being educated on the streets and while breaks laws, helps poor/needy and then gets revenge on villain.  By modern times, these movies look silly.  For its time, it was entertaining though was a 'lost' movie (same year as Sholay & other hits).  In fact in the late 1970's I couldn't find the audio cassette or LP anywhere which is why I jumped on this movie (I was in the mood of listening to that song 'Yeh duniya ek numberi'.  Hema Malini in the mid-1970's was at the top of her game and this movie was no exception (around the time of hits like Sholay, Mehbooba & others).  My kids also enjoyed the song 'Yeh Duniya ek numberi to mein dus numberi'

As far as the DVD goes, from what I've seen, you can tell it's an old movie not digitally remastered or as sharp as a new movie (maybe little dull quality) but I wasn't expecting such.  The print is clear and audio is good quality.  Now I'm not an expert or anything but the average guy quality is good.  I was originally worried given how hard it was to find the movie or audio 30-35 years ago that this would be of very bad quality but MossarBaer puts out good quality of very old movies including subtitles and song menu.  I would recommend only buy the movie if you've seen it before and don't mind outdated, average stories and acting and action of the 1970's.  Like I said, for nostalgia and songs and not for low price.",1354406400,,1820,4.240579710144927
