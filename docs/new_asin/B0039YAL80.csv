4099076,5,B0039YAL80,I loved the in depth interviews and information that was with held during the time of his death. I was glad I bought this will show this to my sons and let them know about the dangers of drugs.,1293148800,,193,3.9743589743589745
4099077,4,B0039YAL80,Product came within a reasonable timeframe. DVD quality was ok. Fairly happy with the purchase.,1287619200,,95,5.4
4099078,5,B0039YAL80,"Reading the other reviews, everyone is writing about what a tremendous loss the death of Len Bias was (which, of course, it was).  No one has mentioned what a wonderful documentary this is.  The film has basically two parts: 1) Len Bias' history / events leading up to his death, and 2) the aftermath of his death.  This film is very detailed in terms of who was with Bias and what they were doing the night he died.  Many people are interviewed for this documentary, including friends and family to get a complete understanding of what went on before and after he died.  You will not be sorry if you buy this DVD.",1279756800,10,614,4.398230088495575
4099079,5,B0039YAL80,"I bought this video after watching it on ESPN so that I could show an 8th grade Social Skills class that I teach.  It was very appropriate to that age group, showing the dangers of drugs but especially how ones actions can have a lasting and sometimes damaging effect on those that we love.  Growing up and living in the Washington, Maryland area I was surprised to find that not one 8th grader had ever heard of Len Bias.  Hopefully by watching this and discussing the mistakes that he made, his death will not be in vain.",1275782400,2,523,4.371134020618556
4099080,5,B0039YAL80,"For those either too young to remember, or blinded by the corporate light of his 'Airness', this documentary chronicles a sad 'what could have been'. Leonard Kevin Bias was a hoop phenomenon matched in his tragedy only by that of Eric 'Hank' Gathers.  When I think of how the arc of play in the NBA would have changed with these two...I can only say, 'dang...'  Len was a force and I, for one, feel that we would not think of Michael Jordan, the way we do, if fate had dealt Len's hand differently.

Boston would have competed for at least 3-5 more championships with Len.  Both Bird and McHale would not have had to play the extended minutes they did, and there would have also been tougher matchups for LA, Detroit and Chicago with him in their rotation.

As far as championships go...LA probably wouldn't have won back to back in 1987-88, Detroit either in 1989-90.  And Chicago would not have won 3 in a row in 1991-93.  That's a lot of history to have had an effect on, but Len was just that good.

Magic, Isiah and Jordan should all place a dozen red roses on his grave every June 19th, just out of respect.",1270512000,11,1113,4.368932038834951
4099081,4,B0039YAL80,"Wow!!
What if this tragedy never happened? I ask myself that every so often when his name comes up. Would the ""Air Bias"" have been the shoe of choice??
I remember watching this guy play. He was incredible. He was unstoppable. No one really had an answer for him in the college game. You just kinda hoped that he would have ""off"" games. He was truly a man amongst boys in college.
I watched the draft, and being a Lakers fan, I hated that Boston was able to get Bias. I later felt terrible when i found out he died. I don't remember if I cried when it happened, but after watching this film, I almost did as it brought up those old feelings as a youngster.
This film was very well done. I enjoyed looking back at such a sad event, and even learned some things that I never knew about the situation. After watching this, I think you too will wonder to yourself...... what if.",1268524800,13,873,4.233532934131737
4099082,5,B0039YAL80,"Well told story, as are all of the 30 for 30 stories I've seen so far.  As a parent, I will be choosing my time and place to share this one with my children in hopes it will improve their ability to make good choices in their life.",1390003200,,231,3.8125
4099083,5,B0039YAL80,Great family movie to show how dreams can be lost in seconds.  Kids need to watch more movies based on a true story than most of the garbage we see on tv nowadays.,1378339200,,163,3.9393939393939394
4099084,1,B0039YAL80,"ESPN Films 30 for 30: Without Bias is an ironical title because it has been a one-sided presentation of the story surrounding Len Bias. Not too much is talked about what the investigators had uncovered in the aftermath. It doesn't even tell the audience that the fired coach of University of Maryland (UMD) told his players to cover up the crime scene by taking the drugs away. There is a report that he knew all about Len Bias' cocaine problem and didn't do anything about it. Also, missing is the information that Len Bias was a habitual cocaine sniffer. Neither is the report that Len Bias was cheating and failing in school and was far below in the totem pole in terms of academic eligibility. Nor the piece tries to show the rampant drug use, especially cocaine and steroid, among athletes, including the UMD athletes, at a larger scale during the 80's. There isn't a lot of reaction towards the people who were primarily involved, and if there is any acrimony amongst them. There isn't anything in the piece about the rampant NCAA violations that were going on during the 80's which still exist to this day. All in all, ESPN Films 30 for 30: Without Bias is very biased, one-dimensional picture.",1362441600,5,1201,4.669811320754717
4099085,5,B0039YAL80,Outstanding film with very Powerful information for future athletes.  The Len Bias story is an american tragedy and many will not remember the occurance,1354838400,,152,5.333333333333333
4099086,5,B0039YAL80,"In this film, Michael Wilbon notes that many of Len Bias' generation can remember exactly where they were the day that he died.  That is totally true, and I remember exactly where I was: at my student job on campus.  When one of my colleagues came into work and told us the news, you could have knocked us over with a feather.  When the news came out about his drug use, we couldn't have been more shocked.  This was a man destined for greatness, who had superstar status but was simply a nice guy who loved his family, friends and basketball.  I loved the footage of all of his skills, and the many interviews with not only his family and friends, but journalists, sportscasters and news anchors that covered the story.  He would have been a legend, and he is missed to this day.  Great DVD!",1344556800,4,792,4.383561643835616
4099087,4,B0039YAL80,"In the Baltimore area, the college basketball rooting interest of many are the Maryland Terrapins.  I grew up in Baltimore and remember watching Len Bias play. This documentary does a great job of illustrating just how impactful and dominating he was at the time.  He was Maryland basketball-and if he played well (and he consistently did), Maryland usually won--he carried the team and made everyone around him better.  I remember thinking after the Boston Celtics drafted him just how great they would be--possibly unstoppable.

What a shock it was to hear about his death--it seemed so sudden and surreal at the time--and at the time his death was shrouded in mystery as the details were not readily forthcoming in the media.  This DVD sheds light on the circumstances, details and information regarding his death.

I manage an outpatient drug and alcohol treatment center in Baltimore, Maryland.  I am very surprised that many of our clients (most in the 18 - 30 age range) have no idea who Len Bias is or was...I purchased this DVD to show to the clients I serve...hopefully it will help teach the dangers of drugs through the story of Bias' life and tragic death...No one is totally immune to the dangers of substances--no matter how talented one might be.  If showing this DVD helps even one person change their path from drug use to sobriety then it will be well worth it.  Thanks for reading...",1340928000,4,1403,4.8125
4099088,5,B0039YAL80,"This DVD tells a story that should not be forgotten.  The story of Len Bias can be used as a great educational tool in dealing with the effects of drugs, cocaine in particular.  Every library should have a copy of it.",1335484800,,217,4.2682926829268295
4099089,5,B0039YAL80,"As a celtic fan I've been always interested in Bias story, the documental is no about sports, but who Bias was and what he meant to fans, players and family. His death brought consciusness on how athletes interacted with drugs in the 80's and the possible consecuences for doing that.
ESPN compiled great footage (see also the extras fetures with extended interviews) really worth buying.

4099090,5,B0039YAL80,"An oustanding look at how the fortunes of The Bias family and the Celtics took a nosedive when the young man died of cocaine use. Interviews with all involved are here, and provide insights into what type of person Bias was, and just what a great talent he had been. This is a good watch for not just Celtics fans, but for anyone who is interested in the story of Len Bias.",1295049600,,373,4.194444444444445
4099091,5,B0039YAL80,"In the early 1980's, one of the true meccas of college basketball was the Washington, DC area.  Georgetown, led by Patrick Ewing, went to three final fours and won it all in 1984.  The University of the District of Columbia ruled the basketball world in Division II in 1982 and 1983 behind Earl Jones and Michael Britt.  Howard University was very competitive behind the ""Dunk Patrol"" teams led by Larry Spriggs and James Ratiff.  Even the 1983 North Carolina State championship team was led by three players from the Washington area -- DeMatha teammates Sidney Lowe and Dereck Whittenburg and Thurl Bailey from Bladensburg.

But many (including myself) will tell you that the best player in the area at that time played at the University of Maryland -- Len Bias. Never was Lefty Driesell closer to making Maryland his ""UCLA of the East"" then his teams in the early 80's.  It was great to see the local talent Bias go from raw talent in high school to powerful superstar in the ACC.

As Michael Wilbon says in the documentary, many people remember where they were when Len Bias died.  For those like me who are from the DC area, this is a tough documentary to watch, but it must be watched.  Director Kirk Fraser does a magnificent job of telling this story in such a way that it can be handed down from generation to generation.  There is a true lesson in this story and younger people should see this great documentary.",1293408000,,1421,4.603174603174603

8392488,5,B0039YAL80,"I was at University of Maryland when he was there though I didn't know him personally.
I was so happy when he got drafted.  I think he would have rivaled Michael Jordan.
The movie is rather well done.  It takes you through the chain of events. I like
the old clips of him. I've seen his gravesite which is next to his brother because he
is near my family. I noticed it because one day there was this pair of tennis shoes on
the grave so I came over to take a look and it was him!  Nice.",1395619200,,486,3.938775510204082
