489239,4,630265856X,"This was the prologue to Jonathan Demme's directorial greatness, with MELVIN AND HOWARD, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, STOP MAKING SENSE...LAST EMBRACE is a tight little thriller that sadly never found an audience.  There are some great moments here:  Christopher Walken as the snary head of the nameless intel-agency;  Roy Scheider's wardrobe;  Janet Margolin in the bathtub (and shower).  Great homage to all classic suspense films.  Where's the DVD?",1083196800,21,444,5.455882352941177
489240,3,630265856X,"This exercise in neo-Hitchcockian psychological thriller is proof positive that no one can beat the Master at his own game, even when the director is as talented as Jonathon Demme. The start is deliciously promising with titles that move around and an irrestistibly lush score by Miklos Rozsa, but soon Demme gets bogged down - there is a recap of the opening scene that reads as totally superfluous - and in spite of having an unusually well-written and witty script to play with, Demme falls back on campy direction. One can practically tick off the allusions to Spellbound, Vertigo, North by Northwest and Psycho when they come. The lighting of this film is generally uninspired, and there is a particulaly badly handled set-piece in a belltower. Even the climactic chase at Niagara Falls (a location Hitchcock never got to), is disappointing. You know Demme is lost when he can't even present the falls well. As the man on the run from an Aramaic death threat for being the descendent of a white slave ""whoremaster"", Roy Scheider is dressed in a white suit so that we get that he is wired. Scheider is too neurotic to be a romantic lead. When he suggests that Janet Margolin has unfinished business with him as a come on, we're surprised she doesn't head for the door. Margolin does well as the repressed anthropologist (Scheider amusingly describes her as ""aggressively unattractive"") but she can't make the leap to femme fatale, and she looks very silly when she runs. The idea of hard boiled Scheider amongst egghead intellectuals is one idea that is never explored, and regrettably he scores an unneccessary sidekick instead. Demme always casts his supporting players well and though they have practically nothing to do, it's fun to see Christopher Walken and John Glover. We also see Jacqueline Brooks, David Margulies, Max Wright and a fleshy Mandy Patinkin.",974505600,21,1868,4.933333333333334

489284,4,630265856X,"I must have been one of the few people who saw and enjoyed this ""Hitchcockian"" thriller back in 1979.  Don't know why this film didn't find an audience; some have said a poor marketing campaign and a trailer that gave the plot away as reasons.  Co-producer Michael Taylor in a very interesting on-camera interview for this DVD release denies this and like many a good film, it  just didn't click for some unknown reason.
This is a very good suspense thriller, excellently directed by Jonathan Demme (twelve years later he would win Best Picture and Director Oscars for ""The Silence of the Lambs"")  and boasting strong performances from Roy Scheider and Janet Margolin.  Exciting and fast paced with an unusual plotline and featuring some superb location photography by Tak Fujimoto, this is a very enjoyable film. Loved the shots on a Connecticut railway station and the conclusion at Niagara Falls is breathtaking.  All this is played out with the assistance of another thrilling, pulsating music score by Miklos Rozsa.  It's very ""Rozsa"" - isn't that enough to excite you to another level of appreciation?
The obvious references to Hitchcock are all there; Demme was not the first young director to pay homage to the ""master"".  Nods to classics like ""Vertigo"" and ""North By Northwest"" and even a Demme cameo.  Maybe there are others: ""The Birds"", ""Marnie"" to mention a couple that crossed my mind.",1416700800,3,1399,4.944444444444445

489286,4,630265856X,"Alfred Hitchcock's repertoire inspired many filmmaker's from Brian De Palma's stylish homages to Gus Van Sant's dreadful ""Psycho"" remake.  Though ""Last Embrace"" seems informed by the Master, in particular ""Vertigo"", director Jonathan Demme adds enough of his own flourishes that you're not about to scream rip-off.  Story wise it's not classic stuff but the selling points would be the terrific cast and some eye opening set pieces notably a shootout in the Princeton University bell tower and a tense Niagara Falls finale.  Roy Scheider is terrific as the government operative who suffers a breakdown after witnessing his wife's killing achieving the correct equilibrium between sanity and mental imbalance.  The late Janet Margolin, who portended great things after an auspicious debut in ""David and Lisa"" and appeared in ""Take the Money and Run"" as Woody Allen's wife, has a sexy enigmatic turn as the anthropologist who occupies Scheider's apartment while he was recuperating and later his bed.  Demme assembles a terrific supporting cast that includes early roles for Christopher Walken and John Glover as well as Demme stalwart Charles Napier. The only things missing are Tracey Walter and Chris Isaak.  All kidding aside, a classic score by Miklos Rozsa accentuates this very good film from a director who would later achieve greater things.

489310,4,630265856X,"The new blu-ray is very nice, with a short interview with one of the producers as a bonus.  The film itself is an eccentric pleasure; sort of Hitchcockian, but as with other Demme films of the time, more concerned with the supporting characters than with the basic thrust of the plot.  (""Silence of the Lambs"" in contrast was Demme at his best behavior).  If you want straight Hitchcockian homage, you'll scratch your head a lot at this.  But if you want to see John Glover, Christopher Walken and others create memorably strange supporting characters and some (largely humorous) thriller setpieces, all anchored by a dependably resolute Roy Schieder in the lead, you might well like this.

SYNOPSIS:
CIA agent Harry Hannah (Roy Scheider) and wife are having dinner when three men burst into the restaurant and open fire. Mrs. Hannah is killed and Harry's now convinced that someone is trying to murder him. He's institutionalized for almost four months after suffering a nervous breakdown. Once released and back home, Harry discovers his government-owned apartment has been sublet by the Agency to a beautiful young grad student named Ellie Fabian (Janet Margolin).

Eckart, his boss (Christoper Walken) believes Harry's too unstable and a liability--  he wants to be rid of this problem agent altogether. Along the way, Harry and Ellie get involved, there's a ""startled in the shower"" scene and a shootout/pursuit to the top of a bell tower. The story ends in classic Hitchcock fashion: with a one-on-one chase at a lavish outdoor location (Niagara Falls).

Ably directed by Jonathan Demme and given a thrilling music track by Miklos Rosza, LAST EMBRACE is as close as any modern picture has gotten to the work of the great Alfred H.

As of 2/09, ""Last Embrace"" was not available on a Region 1 DVD.

489317,5,630265856X,"Finally! I've been waiting for someone to make this 1979 thriller available on DVD. I'd pretty much worn out my old VHS tape of it. The new Kino Lorber DVD is a big improvement on the MGM tape, with clear picture and sound. This is Jonathan Demme's tribute to the films of Alfred Hitchcock. I first saw this clever film in a theater in 1979, and I'm the world's bigggest Hitchcock fan, so...

A grieving former CIA agent (Roy Scheider), whose wife was killed by a bullet meant for him, goes looking for the killers and finds a very creepy mystery involving an enigmatic woman (Janet Margolin) and a private eye (Sam Levene). Soon he's on the run in classic Hitchcock fashion, in a series of calamities and near-misses that culminates in a tense face-off at a national monument (Niagara Falls, not Mount Rushmore). It's an early film by Demme, who would go on to make THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, among others. If you don't think this movie is a deliberate tribute to AH, check out the scene in the bell tower!

The director attempted to imitate some of Hitchcock's suspense, but the the poor continuity and direction was confusing.  I will not watch this movie again.  The orthodox Jewish premise for the secret revenge of generations long past is rather absurd.

I even ordered a European region disc, and bought an all region DVD player to watch it and other great movies not available on USA DVD. That European disc transfer was awful. Now comes this new USA Kino Blueray transfer and it is magnificent. Deme, Miklos Rozsa, Scheider, Margolin and the rest of a stellar cast, and even the cinematographer Fujimoto, all are superb. This new transfer even seems better than the theater screen version I remember from 1979. Forget about the Hitchcock allusions, they don't matter. Watch it for its own merits. By the way the back story about those days of yore, when pimps from all backgrounds waited for the incoming ships to inveigle immigrant women into prostitution, is historically accurate. Get this Blueray version.",1483574400,2,811,4.841726618705036
7828661,5,630265856X,"Jonathan Demme's Hitchcock homages in 1979's ""Last Embrace,"" for young fledgling as he was at the time were quite accomplished.  Several incidences like the stalking and subsequent in the bell tower, and the events all leading to a rather national monument as Hitchcock's ""North By Northwest"" led to Mount Rushmore, ""Last Embrace"" has its climatic moments at Niagara Falls.  One it's producers, Michael Taylor is interviewed on one of the few extras on the blu-ray version tells us Demme even had a cameo as a ""stranger on a train"" and channeled the Hitchcock legend by hiring one of Hitchcock's best composers, Miklos Rozsa (""Spellbound"") to do the music.  Co-producer is Dan Wigutow.  Demme has a brilliant assist by cinematographer Tak Fujimoto.  Screenplay by David Shaber is based on an original novel, ""The 13th Man"" by Murray Teigh Bloom.  Roy Scheider is the best I've ever seen him, however, I believe he scored in Hitchcock territories in David Newman and Robert Benton's (""Bonnie and Clyde"") ""Still of the Night"" (1982) with Meryl Streep which I've never seen. Janet Margolin is as I've never seen her either, however, she has been consistently been practically ignored by Hollywood since coming to acclaim in ""David and Lisa"" (1962).  Demme  goes out of his way to take little risk, and although the film was not noticed much at the time of its release, in hindsight seems the better for it.  It is distinctive, but never a facsimile like in even the titles by Pablo Ferro.  Although he scored highly later with ""Silence of the Lambs,"" (he won an AA), he kind of washed out in his re-make of Stanley Donen's classic, ""Charade"" (""The Truth About Charlie"" (2002)) which suffered from its poor casting choices who had no charisma. It serves well more for a comparison to Hitchcock than as a true conspiracy theory film as its touted now, but the subject matter is truly unique.

7828664,5,630265856X,"When it comes to film reviews, nothing galls me more than reviewers and would-be reviewers who love to hear (see) themselves talk (write) and the inevitable comparisons to ""The Master,""  Hitchcock when it comes to films of this genre. The truth is that Hitchcock, deserving as he was was not God. Many of his films, in particular everyone's favorite, Vertigo (also mine) has plenty of room for improvement in dialogue and certainly the ridiculously abrupt ending which always struck me as ""Hurry! Let's finish, we're running out of film!"" I would subtitle that classic ""Finale interruptus"" thanks to the abrupt and unsatisfying finish. Nevertheless, it's a great film but not without flaws. Rarely is perfection attained, especially in the movies.

That said, Last Embrace may not be  the Gone With the Wind  of mysteries but it's a strong contender for the top of the heap of mysteries that are not derived from cookie-cutter scripts and that fascinate. Plus, (a BIG) plus, Janet Margolin is superb playing a complex character. If you avoid this film it will be your loss.",1440115200,2,1073,4.977653631284916
7828665,2,630265856X,"Having read the reviews I thought this might be an interesting movie and realizing I had a laser disc copy I dug through the crypt and isolated the relic... The music was great. Laser discs can be very good at music.
The opening scenes are oddly colored...I figured flashback or dream or bad laser mastering- all appears equally possible...later it seems it was part of each.
Hitchcock homages ?. There is a shower scene; a bell tower scene; a spy being chased by spies. Probably more, those are the ones easy enough for me to catch.
But aping Sir Alfred is not what Jonathan Demme is about. One reviewer noted Mr. Demme loves actors which was not what Sir Alfred was alleged to be about. And there is excellent supporting acting, especially Christopher Walken. And Roy Scheider is fine throughout the film.
The writing/plotting is not good. Perhaps the script needed one more rewrite. Perhaps it was bad/rushed editing. Or perhaps it was some cynical front office suit who said ""get the product out there kid."" (or some such Hollywood line). I dunnno. The movie does not have very good plot coherence. Make that ""plots"" coherence because there are two running simultaneously, with one being kind of a cheat/red herring. And the ""big reveal"" for one is handled so abruptly I at first thought I must have dosed off and missed the ""set-up"". Nope, there was no setup.
All in all not rewarding for plot(s) development and continuity. But there is nice acting and Mr. Demme does get actors to act. And in a few more years he does it brilliantly (Swimming to Cambodia"", Married to the Mob"" and of course ""Silence of the Lambs"" and then ""Philadelphia""and on.",1436140800,,1651,4.716262975778546
