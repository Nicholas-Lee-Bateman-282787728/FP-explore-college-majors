7978706,1,B000083C8I,"This DVD in far from what Peach got us used to expect, meaning full tandalizing nudity. I got bored from it and turned it off long before it ends. Nothing interesting actually no total nudity and NO ""detailed"" shots or spicy views as those seen on other Peach productions. I'd say, don't go for it. Instead, try other DVDs, from the same company, they have much more to offer. There are much more ripe and juicy ""Peaches"" on the tree. Go for then instead.",1176854400,9,455,4.428571428571429
