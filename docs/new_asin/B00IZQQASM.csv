6307073,4,B00IZQQASM,"Above-average B movie, with no shortage of full frontal T&A if that's your thing.  Some of the sex scenes were likely unsimulated, I'd bet there is an unedited version of this out there somewhere.  I've seen better, I've seen worse, but this is worth a watch.  Originally shot in German, titled ""Der Ruf der blonden Gttin"" (Call of the Blonde Goddess).  The English dubbing was well done.",1508976000,5,388,4.746268656716418

6307076,3,B00IZQQASM,"Older movie. Middle aged woman is enchanted by voodoo and has a sexual awakening.  The women aren't very attractive, some of the extras aren't bad. Acting is fairly poor all around. Script- cranked out in a half hour by town drunk.  Which is ok... they just filled it with graphic sex and graphic full body nudity.  Both female and male nudity.  Some scenes were tame, others were quite possibly not simulated.  Definitely not for children or anyone with taste.",1505260800,19,461,4.784810126582278
6307077,5,B00IZQQASM,"With Jess Franco you do not buying movie you buying Jess Franco. I managed to waste money on at least 20 of his flicks and all of them nonsense but...they all have hot naked chicks and  about 30 seconds of something that makes me to waste more money and trying to think.
Yes, the color quality is pretty good and English is okay. Sure rating it as a porno is nonsense as there is nothing close to sex or anything explicit and plot is a pretence for...?  Actually I prefer D'Amato  and if I make Tinto Brass as a benchmark for any movie D'Amato will be way up and Jess Franco way down.",1404950400,12,584,4.150442477876106
8646888,5,B00IZQQASM,"Compared to other films in this genra I give it 5 stars. The acting is above average and the plot is suspenseful and moves at a reasonable pace. There is both female and male FF nudity if that is what you want. The Voodoo is well performed and blended into the plot. This is vintage Franco. If you like his style, you will enjoy watching this one.",1532476800,,347,4.1940298507462686

8646891,5,B00IZQQASM,"My dating years were in the late 70's.  The era of drive in theaters and B movies.  Soso acting, soso story and lots of nudity.  This movie is the flagship of the genre.  Pretty much there is a naked woman on the screen the entire movie, with a lush growth of grass in the front yard(metaphor). If this is your kind of movie then you will be very satisfied.",1525996800,,357,4.130434782608695
8646892,4,B00IZQQASM,"Voodoo Passion (AKA  Call of the Blonde Goddess), a 1977 softcore film with Nanda Van Bergen, Ada Tauler, and Karine Gambier as the main actresses.  Briefly stated the idea for the story line is a woman arrives in Haiti supposedly to be with her husband, the British Ambassador living in Haiti.  She falls under the hypnotic spell of Voodoo and as though she were schizophrenic commits crimes without being sure of whether or not it is just a bad dream.

As some of you may know, there isn't a great story line or great acting in softcore films, and the music soundtrack can be tediously abysmal at times.  A Neiman Marcus catalog or the website for La Fayette coats, jackets, shawls, and capes  have a variety of furs, but the film Voodoo Passion has furs that get my attention more easily.  The Hudsons Bay Company, Compagnie de la Nouvelle France, The North West Company, and Compagnie de la Baie du Nord would have bought stock in the film Voodoo Passion.  Fur trappers know a beaver is worth more with a good pelt.  Similarly, Wal-Mart, Target, and the website Amazon dot com have a variety of baby feeding nipples, but there again, the nipples in the film Voodoo Passion also were far more interesting.

The film has tourism footage that if it were genuinely factual, would make me book my next trip to Haiti to watch the voodoo dancers.  Without equivocation, I am certain beyond doubt, those dances are nothing at all as worthy as this film depicts, without requiring more money to watch than Ill ever have.  So Voodoo Passion footage of voodoo dancers is as good as it gets in my case.  And yet the male dancers must almost overdose on potassium nitrate, Id have a soldier at full attention.

Consider yourself warned, this film is definitely not a PG rating film.",1521936000,3,1773,4.623003194888179

8646894,4,B00IZQQASM,"If you like Jess Franco movies, you are likely to like this one.  The actresses are not knock-outs, but they are not unattractive either, and you do get to see all of them a lot, perhaps most, of the time.",1519171200,3,205,4.125
