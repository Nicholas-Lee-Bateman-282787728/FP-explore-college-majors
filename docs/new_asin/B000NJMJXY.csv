2770211,5,B000NJMJXY,"I am a huge fan of the Hermie movies....and it doesn't change with Milo the Praying Mantis.  As a mother, it is a good and wholesome movie for my daughter to watch and to see the importance of prayer and also the fact that not all prayers are answered immediately.  It has humor that will make both parent and child laugh.  Loved, loved loved the movie! Oh and it was in good shape when I received it.",1239667200,2,401,4.181818181818182

2770215,5,B000NJMJXY,"Milo the Mantis who Wouldn't Pray is another great installment in the Hermie and Firends franchise.  An excellent cast of talent, animators, producers, writers, and the actors of course.  Very well done.

This video addresses prayer and does a good job of letting kids know that God doesn't always respond in a way we might expect, nor is there any special method to get close to God no matter what we do in our own power.  My son (age 4 - wants to give this video 100 stars.)  I like that the Hermie and Friends video open up dialogue with young hearts and get them interested in the Bible.",1172188800,7,591,4.385321100917431

Very disappointed!",1361577600,,177,4.363636363636363
8178699,5,B000NJMJXY,"This is a favorite of my son. Excellent teaching brings about pride, individuality, and that is not good to be away from God. Also teaches us how much God loves us and cares even with the bugs.",1308268800,,193,4.243243243243243
8178700,3,B000NJMJXY,"A Review of Max Lucado's Hermie & Friends
  This video proves that bugs have a lot more to do than invade picnics, houses, and bite unsuspecting children. The little bugs in this collection of dvd's deal with bickering, fighting, naughty behavior, and lack of praying. On the out set, I must say that the video is quality, has vibrant colors, and cute voices. However, the content is not very good. It seems like the lessons are a bit forced, and not natural to the story line. Also, I know it is trying to prove a point, but I really don't want to show my children bickering on a regular basis. They thus far don't have that problem, and I don't want it modeled to them constantly. All that to say is, I don't quite know what is missing with so many of these Christian dvd's today. I guess everyone can't be veggie tales. All in all I would not say don't borrow it from a friend to see if it is for you, but I would say, don't buy it quite",1302480000,,940,4.1878453038674035

8178702,5,B000NJMJXY,Great DVD for your family  - especially the young children.  It's a good reminder for us to just 'talk to God'!!!,1248134400,,113,4.333333333333333
