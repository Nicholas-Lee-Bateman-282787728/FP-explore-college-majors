8610115,3,B00EWNJLME,FYI - The Olden Days Coat is only about 25 minutes long. It's a lesson on the importance of family and our heritage. The cartoons are old but the kids love them. I bought this because I love Christmas movies and am happy I only paid $1 for it. It's definitely not a good quality copy if that's important to you.,1447286400,,311,4.114754098360656
