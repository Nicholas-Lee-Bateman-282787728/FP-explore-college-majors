5673301,4,B00BTYOYGW,"The ending, I mean. Okay, I probably should have, but I didn't. Watched this movie a long time ago, but it always stuck with me. Maybe it was the performances of the stellar cast, all of whom had great careers. You probably think of Alan Alda as a TV actor because of the iconic series ""Mash,"" but he was a very good movie actor, too. (Check out his performance in ""The Mephisto Waltz."") Annabella Sciorra and Jamey Sheridan moved on to the Law & Order franchise. The late Jill Clayburgh was very effective in a minor but key role. All in all, a solid thriller.",1388448000,,561,4.352380952380952
5673302,5,B00BTYOYGW,This movie is excellent!  There are so many twists and turns in this movie and really I had seen it years ago but wanted to see it again with my family.  The actors are excellent and the ending subject line is terrorizing. One would never guess what was really going on! A must see!,1371168000,,282,4.203703703703703

8573795,5,B00BTYOYGW,I don't want to give this movie away but all the twist in this movies will have you shocked at the end...is all I have to say!  It was a great movie!  You can tell it was made in the 90's but that just makes it a classic and not less interesting!  This is not a children's movie at all!  If you want to watch this one make sure the kiddies are in bed.  I know they do so much more these days but in the 90's this movie was pushing the envelop.,1468886400,,443,3.7204301075268815
