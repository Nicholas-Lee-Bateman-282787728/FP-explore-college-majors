7904989,2,B000006REC,"A blockbuster of a witless washout, starring an inept, almost non-existent Robert Wagner, a poor man's Elizabeth Taylor in the person of Joan Collins, and Edmund O'Brien, who -- thanks to a fatuous, 3rd-rate script -- commanded little attention as a conscious-bereft murderer. ""Cutesy-wootsy"" little girl Reiko Oyama -- cloying to the nth degree -- will trigger an instant cavity in your cinematic sweet tooth.

Two overly generous stars for the pleasant, Oriental-like score by Paul Sawtell -- the films only saving grace.  Nonetheless, it would be an insult to good taste to recommend you put STOPOVER TOKYO on your must-watch list",1502064000,,633,5.196078431372549
7904990,4,B000006REC,A really first rate trashy movie. I love this stuff but I recognize that film buffs might want something more substantial. But this is for me.,1435104000,,142,4.5
7904991,4,B000006REC,"A government agent from America arrives in Tokyo, Japan to prevent an assignation of a leading United States official stationed there. Robert Wagner, Joan Collins and Edmond O'Brien are all convincing and most effective.  Filmed on location in Japan.  Cinemascope and color ass
greatly to the quality of the production and the scenery is well-worth watching.  Moves quickly and is exciting.  The final moments of the picture
are especially good as two American agents race against time to save an important diplomat's life.  Worth watching.",1426204800,,540,5.305882352941176
7904992,4,B000006REC,"It is a pleasure to see post war Japan, specifically beautiful classic Kyoto, complete with traditional gardens, carp, a Japanese girl singing in a kimono, ladies wearing kimonos at parties and some old wooden houses. Robert Wagner is easy in the eyes, but in my opinion too young to be the CIA agent sent over to deal with a possible communist front operation.
South African-born Joan Collins plays a transportation coordinator at the Japanese airport. She longs for love and marriage with a non-Japanese. The men she meets are all coming and going with work plus they're lready married alas. She is meant to be a knockout for male viewers. That she is but the young conscientious CIA mr. Wagner doesn't want to play and has been instructed to feign a marriage and children stateside.
The plot is a plodding one and the modern viewer may start fast forwarding the DVD without losing much. The original John Marquand novel is a much Better story but this is the film industry playing fast and easy with books. If you have read a lot before getting hooked on films, you know that it is always a big insult or injustice to the original novel.
On the other hand I must say that without the release of these old films, someone like me would never even hear about the original Mr. Moto series by Marquand. That is a pity, how quickly books become obscure and irrelevant, when they're much more interesting about the politics of those times and the cultural stereotypes.
I didn't find the love interest very intense no matter the two main actors' good looks. Something was definitely lacking on the male side.
The plot is plodding but the scenery beautiful. Old Japan is vanishing but still there in the mountains and faraway villages. The schoolchildren all lined up in their uniforms singing is still charming. The Japanese six year old orphan, daughter of the assassinated mr. Mobiko, is sweet with her perpetually smiling face even when she knows her father is never coming back. Wagnrr's declaration that he loves her and wants to take her to the USA seems absurd. At best he seemed amused at her antics and songs
In any case a viewer's own ideas about the Japanese will enter into his or her reaction. I was very impressed with the people there in 1990 on a one month independent travel around. Hard to imagine that they would have fallen under the poisonous spell of the ""vodka and caviar"" set. The Russian Comminists were very jealous of Japan and its success. Yet in a sense they are more communistic in their behavior than the Chinese. It is more a case of fascism or state capitalism in Japan today.
Have you seen on YouTube the Come Fly With Me sketch with the Japanese schoolgirls waiting for Martin Clune at the airport? Hilarious! Also see Teahouse of the August Moon as Amrricans try to explain equality and democracy to the peasants harvesting yams.",1394064000,,2860,4.687872763419483
7904993,2,B000006REC,"""Stopover Tokyo"" is a beautifully produced DeLuxe color-CinemaScope produced film that was shot in Kyoto, Japan in 1957. The film's beautiful sets and stars, Robert Wagner, Joan Collins, and Edmond O'Brien, are worth the purchase, I guess? About their acting and the feature's pre-James Bond story, however, well, I suppose, I shouldn't say. What I would have to say about them would be... in plain English: not nice! But if you want my slight and somewhat nicer opinion, I'll say the entire cast is over-acting! Even Joan Collins does terribly with the poor script that is given to her. This just proves the fact that some actresses/actors have to have ""good"" scripts to make it work! However, I must admit that Collins in one of the most devastatingly beautiful actresses of the 1950s. I also believe she is way underrated, being known too much as a ""second Elizabeth Taylor"" and a ""Marilyn Monroe/Jayne Mansfield back-up"". I must admit, however, I am a huge fan of Monroe, Mansfield, and Taylor, but I also think that the studios relied on them way too much and tried to make clones of them way too often. Mansfield herself was a Monroe clone, who eventually broke the mold! Collins never really reached the status as these other actresses and doesn't hold as much of a legacy in films as they do. Collins in perhaps best well-known for starring as Alexis Carrington Colby on the primetime soap opera, ""Dynasty"", from 1981 to 1989.

But back to the main point of this review, ""Stopover Tokyo"" can be described in one word over and over: Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! Boring! I suggest if you aren't big fans of Wagner and Collins, who shouldn't purchase this film. And, just for the record, the two stars that are given for this review are for Joan Collins and the sets! Everything else surronding the film gets an D- to an F in my book. It's really no surprise that this film made on $1,350,000 at the box office.",1343001600,2,1919,4.6943620178041545
7904994,4,B000006REC,"I enjoyed the film, partly because I was station over near Tokyo during 1957-1959. I remember
them filming the movie while I was there. I enjoyed seeing Robert Wagner, Edmond O'Brien and
Joan Collins too. I recommend this film very much.",1265760000,2,237,4.804878048780488
7904995,4,B000006REC,"Since the whole plot of this movie hangs on the unraveling of a secret plan, I won't spoil things for any prospective viewer by revealing the details of the story.  In short, though, I could describe STOPOVER TOKYO by saying that it has the feel of an early James Bond film and plays out like an episode of Hawaii Five-O, with a few plot elements from the Elvis movie IT HAPPENED AT THE WORLD'S FAIR thrown in!
To be honest, this 50's-era spy yarn may be a bit too low-key for someone expecting a heavy dose of action, but I found it quite entertaining.  Robert Wagner and Joan Collins, both very young and very good looking, do quite well in the lead roles.  Add to that some beautiful Japanese locales and a nice mix of drama and suspense, and you've got yourself an interesting adventure.
If you're looking for a secret agent film without an overload of violence and special effects, STOPOVER TOKYO is definitely worth checking out.",1216944000,,935,4.553571428571429
7904996,3,B000006REC,"Robert Wagner as an American secret agent, Joan Collins is eye candy, Edmond O'Brien as an assassination conspirator and Ken Scott as another Intelligence agent but somewhat dubious. Litte Reiko Oyama is winning as the orphaned girl. It is wonderful to see Japan of 50 years ago - beautiful, intriguing, traditional. I wish more
movies such ""A Girl Named Tamiko"" were released on DVD sooner instead of later.

We cannot look at American-Japanese relations through 2007 eyes; the circumstances were vastly different.
This movie was set in a Japan after we defeated the Japanese in World War II, when the USA still had a high commissioner helping to govern a country new to western democracy, when there may have been factions willing to undermine stability.",1190505600,4,756,5.048
