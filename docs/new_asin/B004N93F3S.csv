8436515,4,B004N93F3S,"I have worked with See The Light before on one of their other DVD's so I was happy to review their newest one, The Crossmaker, when I was offered to. These are good for the whole family and I love watching them.

I have always been a fan of chalk artists. They seem to make pictures come alive and it really appeals to children! Again, as with my last review I am very pleased with this DVD. See the Light does a very good job with portraying what really happened and I love their Gospel message! Clear but simple enough for a child to understand. The story line also keeps a child's interest. With children sitting there paying attention to someone telling a story, they are more inclined to do this.

The music is beautiful and calming. Very nice! The pictures though are one of my favorite things about this film. The other thing I really liked about this is the lessons given. There are actually lessons to help train a child how to draw with chalk or watercolors! Wonderful way to get them interested!! I watched this part and they talk in a manner that children can understand easily and effectively. This is a great program for a homeschool family or if your children are interested in chalk drawing. Wonderful learning tool!!",1303516800,,1233,4.524663677130045
8436516,5,B004N93F3S,"See the Light's The Crossmaker DVD, featuring an Easter story along with art lessons, is a unique way to present the message of Easter to children. The Easter story on the DVD, appropriately named ""The Crossmaker"" tells the story of Dominic, a carpenter's son, who finds himself drawn into Jesus' trial. While this story isn't ""straight from scripture,"" it lends itself nicely to discussion as children are able to hear the story from the perspective of a child like them. The narrative is presented with Gloria Kohlmann's stunning artwork and skillfully narrated by Gary Pike. While the acting feels a little contrived at times, younger kids will enjoy the simplicity of the story, the bright and colorful artwork, and the fresh interpretation.

I think The Crossmaker lends itself nicely to discussion so, while I wouldn't necessarily utilize this in my large group mixed ages Sunday morning ministry, I think the DVD would be an excellent source for children in small groups who are in kindergarten through about fourth grade.

Also included on the DVD are three art lessons. Heidi Shorts teaches a lesson on creative lettering, Pat Knepley shows kids how to use chalk pastels to create an Easter scene, and Jim Pence gives a tutorial on watercolors. Each art lesson uses a unique medium and runs about twenty to thirty minutes in length. These would be great to use in a classroom setting or with a small group of children. The length of the lessons could easily be broken up by pausing the DVD to allow children time to create their own masterpieces. As can be expected from the Art Class DVD curriculum, each artist on the DVD is engaging and ties biblical truths into their presentation in a way that is fun and memorable.

Finally, the DVD includes some bonus features such as a music video, the plan of salvation, commentary on the story ""The Crossmaker,"" and a meet 'n' greet with the See the Light team.

In my opinion, this DVD would make a wonderful addition to any early elementary school aged child's Easter basket.

8436517,5,B004N93F3S,"With Passover (and Easter) rapidly approaching, believers are finding our hearts drawn more and more towards the cross and Christ's sacrifice for us.  Our family recently had the opportunity to share Christ's sacrificial death and resurrection with our children through See The Light's unique DVD, The Crossmaker (received to review).

Presenting the story of Jesus' death and resurrection through art, children are introduced to the storyteller (a loving grandfather) and the youngsters that he shares the story with.  These characters are live action, but as the story is told, it is presented in chalk art drawings with the camera panning in, moving etc. across the art as appropriate.  The expressions on the faces of the children as they watch their grandfather speak resembled those of my own children.  The children and grandfather appear from time to time as the story progresses, and they share some short devotional thoughts at its conclusion.

This was such a wonderful, gentle, and authentic way to share Jesus' death with my small ones.  They were absolutely awed and have spoken so often of Jesus, the soldiers, and much more in the days that have followed.  Even my toddler has exhibited so much more understanding than she had before.  As wonderful as this portrayal of the cross is, there is even SO much more on this DVD.

Children can watch a chalk artist create a piece of art that shows Christ's sacrifice for us (both with a nd without commentary).  Even though this was around half-an-hour in length, my children couldn't take their eyes off it.  They watched it once with the accompanying worship music, and another time with the artist's commentary, and were absolutely fascinated both times.  My two-year-old grabbed a piece of chalk and had at a piece of construction paper with it!

There are even three separate art lessons - each around thirty minutes in length.  One is a lesson on lettering, which includes a calligraphic style rendering of the word ""Glory"" with an illuminated letter - beautiful.  Another is a chalk pastel drawing of two women approaching the empty tomb, and another is a mixed media lesson with watercolors/maker/pastel.

My eight-year-old completed the mixed media lesson, resulting in the relation of a beautiful piece of artwork showing the three crosses on a hill.  She did it all herself too!  After assembling the supplies, she sat down in front my laptop on the kitchen table with the DVD in it, paused when appropriate, and made it independently!  This DVD has really re-kindled her passion for art; the step-by-step demonstrations and instructions are absolutely wonderful.  She is planning to save up some money to purchase the other DVD in the series - The Gift of Love.

When you visit their website you'll see that they have these DVDs available in sets with the special black-light art supplies and small black-light for adding the black-light touches included in each of the art lessons.  These are optional though, and my daughter has been following the lessons without using black light supplies because we don't have them on hand (yet).

I CANNOT recommend these DVDs enough.  Our entire family is absolutely in love with them, all of our children who are out of the baby stage (2, 5, 8), through to my husband and I.  You really need to experience these excellent (and professionally produced) DVDs for yourself.  They are simply beautiful.",1302652800,,3411,4.991150442477876
8436518,5,B004N93F3S,"I was given the opportunity to review The Crossmaker by See the Light.  Amazing DVD!  The story is recommended for ages 3 and up; the art lessons for ages 6 and up.  It offers the story of Jesus, told thru chalk art.  AMAZINGLY vivid pictures with striking colors and just simply amazing artwork!  There is also a lesson to work on.  I *love* the teaching style of this DVD!",1301788800,,374,4.3478260869565215
8436519,5,B004N93F3S,"The Crossmaker is one of the most beautiful Easter DVDs for children I have seen. The first 16 minutes is a fantastic story of a boy and how he came to be at the crucifixion. The pictures are chalk art and I must say it is so very moving and touching. The Crossmaker really holds the interest of anyone who watches, but gives the full Easter story and is very powerful. If this DVD didn't have anything else, but this story I would highly recommend it, but there is so much more to watch and enjoy.
Next on the DVD are three art lessons and they are fantastic! The first one is Creative Lettering which is 28 minutes, by Heidi Shorts, and then the next is from the Art Teacher Pat Knepley. She shows a step-by-step lesson using chalk pastels, which is 32 minutes. The last art lesson is by Jim Pence. He does water colors and that lesson is 25 minutes. All of these lessons have a Bible theme with a short talk about Jesus and doing the right things.
The bonus features have lots of super things in it also. You will hear the artists Jan Roper and Kevin Dukes singing and performing songs to go along with the extras. The chalk artist Gloria Kohlmann draws a beautiful picture of the Easter story. It's just amazing and you will be drawn into the music, picture and story.
Another part I really like is called Watch and Hear; it is a simple plan of salvation for children. It is so easy to understand and very creative.
The Easter Story-The Crossmaker can be enjoyed by anyone three and older and the art lessons will be enjoyed by anyone six and older.
I highly recommend this wonderful DVD for an Easter gift to be loved and enjoyed by you and your children/grandchildren for years to come.

8436520,5,B004N93F3S,"We all have read and seen the story of Easter according to the Bible, but here is a perfect way to capture the attention of children everywhere with this latest DVD from See The Light called The Crossmaker.

We learn what happens in the life of a boy named Dominic whose father makes crosses. When called to finish a last minute order, his father asks if he will make the cross and deliver it as soon as it is finished. Dominic is reluctant due to the comments his friends make when they see him delivering crosses but his father insists that he be the one to take this cross today. They are expecting it.

We are drawn into the life of a small boy when he delivers the cross to a Roman guard only to see a story unfold before his eyes as Pilate begins to deal with the crowd of people who have brought a man named Jesus before him. Dominic soon will discover that he will play a pivotal part in what ultimately happens to Jesus.

Brought to life by illustrations in chalk as the story unfolds to the viewer, we learn once more about the death and resurrection of Jesus through the telling of the story just in time for Easter. This DVD is packed with extras including over an hour and a half of art lessons showcasing illuminated letters and chalk drawings that your child can watch and complete in easy to follow step by step directions. You also will receive contemporary music performed by Breathing Room as Gloria draws along with it creating the Easter story.

There is so much combined in this one amazing and unforgettable DVD that you can also supplement with The See The Light website for more ideas and DVDs as well. I received this DVD, The Crossmaker, compliments of Propeller and See The Light for my honest review and my entire family LOVED it. We all agree this is a wonderful way to enjoy the story of Easter this holiday. I would highly recommend it and give it a 5 out of 5 stars.
