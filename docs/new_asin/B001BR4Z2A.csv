8534023,5,B001BR4Z2A,"Another in a excellent series of three DVDs that focus on the basic belly dance moves that form the foundation of the art of belly dance.  Not only are these for the beginner but also good reference material for the more advanced dancer.  As with the other DVDs in this series, it not only  contains a clear and easy explanation of each move but also a easy routine that uses the moves demonstrated

Once again, IAMED goes beyond what most other DVDs offer, not only does it include a dynamic stand alone workout designed for the belly dancer but also two performances,in costume, one by Paulina and another by Anaheed.",1350604800,,619,4.6
