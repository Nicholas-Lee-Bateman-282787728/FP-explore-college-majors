333321,5,6301520157,"This was THE movie for my house when I was in college. You know how geeks get together and recite Star Trek and Monty Python dialogue? In our house, we did it for this film compulsively for like a year. Amazing script. Never  a non-funny moment. Every scene is hilarious. The film has serious replay  value as well. If you've been in a band, you can relate to how ego can  overpower reality. Also, neat take on how, in every group, there is one guy  who is the outcast (and is treated like one). This, to me, is the funniest  movie ever made and should be a member of everyone's film collection! Buy  it, it's worth it!",957484800,,619,4.247863247863248

This group will  rock you with political lyrics like ""burning, looting, raping,  shooting (repeat)"" and Vim Fuego's driving guitar solos will make you  think twice before getting on stage ever again.  Bankers stepping in poop;  school girls going on tour; seeing Jimmy Hendrix reincarnated.......it just  doesn't get any better than this!",955411200,,531,4.887640449438202
333323,5,6301520157,This is a hilarious spoof of heavy-metal bands. I never get tired of watching this video. If you like this video I realy recommend you get the Bad News CD.It's just as funny.,921628800,,174,4.303030303030303
333324,4,6301520157,"Hilarious two-part spoof in the tradition of ""This Is Spinal Tap"", Bad News is made up of the cast of ""The Young Ones"" which aired on MTV back in the mid eighties after originally appearing on  the BBC. These two episodes were first shown on another BBC comedy called  ""The Comic Strip"". Rik Mayall, Adrian Edmundson, and Nigel Planer  are hysterical as the hopelessly out-of-touch and out-of-talent heavy metal  act, Bad News. Watch their rise and fall as they go from playing empty  local clubs clubs to somehow getting booked at Castle Donnington, and  subsequently being beaten off-stage by angry metal fans.  A little slow at  times, but fans of British humor and send-ups like ""Spinal Tap""  will love it!",914630400,2,710,4.85
7812464,5,6301520157,"Bad News is fantastic, and deserves a proper DVD release.

It is unfair to suggest that Spinal Tap simply ripped off Bad News. If Bad News was released in 1983 and Tap in 1984, then Reiner and Co, would have to have worked amazingly fast to get their stolen idea into theatres so quickly. In truth, Tap was several years in the making. Check out the extras on the OOP Criterion edition of Spinal Tap to see the history of the film's development. The initial short verion of the film, shot in 16mm (and used to secure additional funding so that the film proper could be made), pre-dates Bad News. The one scrap of that film which made it into the final cut is the long-haired blonde woman who exclaims, ""It's like you become one with the band.""

And, of course, The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash (1978) pre-dates BOTH of those films--having its origin as a Saturday Night Live sketch.",1176336000,,882,4.438271604938271
7812465,4,6301520157,"For me, it doesn't really matter which one was released first, both Bad News Tour and This is Spinal Tap are great.

And to correct an error in an earlier review, it wasn't Reading, it was Monsters of Rock at Donnington that the band played. I know, because I was there! And the scene at the end where the crowd storm the stage and attack the band? Almost happened! I don't know how much the band knew about it, but from where I was standing I could see about 10,000 people and only 3 were laughing! (I was one.) The rest of the people around me were booing and saying stuff like ""I'm going to F**king kill him!"". That's pretty much when I realised that I was over Metal. When you can't laugh at yourself, it's all over! And the band about three places up the bill? Scorpions! I can't watch Spinal Tap without seeing Scorpions all over it (if the album Smell the Glove isn't Animal Magnetism I'll eat my hat!), but Scorpions were dead serious!",1137888000,,943,4.327683615819209
7812466,5,6301520157,"Bad news as an idea was formed in 1983 as part of the ""Comic Strip Presents"" TV series. Spinal was actually released in 1984, so therefore bad news actually do pre-date spinal tap.",1120435200,,180,4.484848484848484
7812467,5,6301520157,"Contrary to the statement made by a previous reviewer, the first ""Bad News Tour"" does not pre-date Spinal Tap.  The Spinal Tap movie was released in 1982, ""Bad News Tour"" was first aired in 1984, and it looks fairly obvious that Adrian Edmondson was influenced by the Spinal Tap movie in writing this.

However, ""Bad News Tour"" is not a straight copy of Spinal Tap, and the portrayal of the clearly awful (although confident that they will still become massive) heavy metal band is full of excellent observational comedy lampooning the UK ""heavy metal"" scene of the early 1980s.

The follow up ""More Bad News"" doesn't work so well (for me, anyway).  It is too much flogging of the same formula, and the idea that such a crap band would ever get signed to a record label, let alone get to play at Reading Festival, just isn't believable enough to make it funny.  If truth be told, the only reason the Reading storyline was used was that Ade Edmondson and company DID play Reading Festival as a novelty item as ""Bad News"" due to the TV success of ""Bad News Tour"" and it probably seemed like a good opportunity to use some of the footage!",1117756800,2,1135,4.517073170731707
7812468,4,6301520157,"Rock On, ""Bad News"". This video is great for those fans of Britcoms like ""The Young Ones"", ""Bottom"", or ""Filthy Rich and Catflap"". It has most of the same actors and even if you're not familiar with the comic genius of Ric Mayall, Adrian Edmondson, or Nigel Planer, you'll still appreciate this spoof of sorry cliched rock bands. This is the truly British equivalent of ""Spinal Tap"" with just as much venom but a bigger heart as well. The only question I have is ""Where's the DVD?""",1056931200,,481,4.540229885057471
7812469,5,6301520157,"If you enjoyed the Young Ones, then this video is worth owning. Its like visiting their cousins from another town...
Apparently the first episode of 'Bad News' actually pre-dates Spinal Tap by a couple of years. But where Spinal Tap were has-beens, Bad News are the Never-weres of the 80's Metal Scene.
This feature length video does tend to resemble the Young Ones at times; Vim Fuego searches for reasons to be violent, like his alter ego Vyvian. Den Dennis delivers monlogues into the camera, straight from the little world he's caught up in, just like Neil. (Although here, they are mostly based on toilet concerns.) And Colin pretends to be Mr Bad-Boy Anarchy metal guy while hoping his parents don't find him smoking a cigarette in his bedroom, very much like Rik.
Along the way are hillarious arguments, guest appearances by metal legands like Lemmy and the Scorpions, and wall to wall heavy metal, as the Gods intended it.
Just buy it already!",1044316800,3,951,4.804878048780488
7812470,5,6301520157,"I swear this is one of the funniest videos of all time.  My friends and I first saw Bad News Reunion on MuchMusic (Canada's MTV-esque cable station) years ago, and it still remains one of our favorite films of all time.  Anyone who has ever been in a garage band will laugh till they cry at the way band life is captured by these two films.  It perfectly captures the absurdity that does often happen, and while standing on the shoulders of the classic ""Spinal Tap"", I personally find this a more honest and hillarious sendup of life in a metal band.
I give this movie my highest recommendation.",1042934400,2,595,4.440366972477064

This melancholy romp through would-be stardom brings a tear to me eye, it does.  It brings me back to the days when I was trying to make it big in Metal...now all me band is working house painting or at banks.
AHhhh YOUTH!

7812473,5,6301520157,"The first time I heard of Bad News was hearing the album which acompanied the films, The Inlay cover alone was worth the price. The films didn't disapoint, continuing the theme of the album. Set at the hight of British heavy metal, the films tell the story of a group of contrasting but equally talentless individuals who make up Bad News, Internationaly renowned as ""The worst heavy metal band in the world"".
The First film, Bad News Tour, charts their humble beginings in London, From Den and Vim's council flat to Colin's Suburbian middle class upbringing, This class diference is just one of the themes of the constant bickering which occours throughout the film, To their less than sucessfull ""Gig"" at The Roxy in Grantham. This is especialy poingiant to me as I have been to The Roxy, before it was pulled down!
The Second film, More Bad News, see's the band reformed by Channel 4 for a one off gig at the flying horse, Vim sets about getting the old characters together, stirring up his long standing hatred for Colin, cue fights over Marshall stacks, the contents of the record contrat, and who gets to be Pete Townsend!
A lot of people who saw these films thought they were making a mockery of all things metal, Including some Famous bands (as you'll see in More Bad News) But I personaly feel that these people were missing the whole point. Having seen some of ""The Comic Strip Presents..."" films, such as The Supergrass, and The Strike, (The later of which does the same for the miners strike as Bad News did for metal) These films are just poking a little bit of fun at an otherwise serious genre(For those who were part of it anyway!)
Watch them, Don't take them seriously, and you will never see two more funny, traditionaly british comedy films.",996624000,,1760,4.626198083067092
