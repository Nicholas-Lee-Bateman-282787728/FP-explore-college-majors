1392045,5,B000053VF8,"It keeps getting better each year. Warren Miller, his son Kurt, and all their ""friends"" who freeride down a mountain join them in awsome locations all around the world for awsome skiing footy. Bob Ranker, Justin Patinode, Mike Douglas, and all the other talented freeriders lend their talents to the completely epic movie which shows what was never possible on the side of a mountian...till now. after watching this you'll pick up yer skis and say ""where's the powder at""",981936000,5,471,4.9

7930381,1,B000053VF8,"I used to love the Warren Miller film's for me and my friends to get ready for ski/snowboard season.  They had a mix of skiing, snowboarding, and you name it.  Now that his son Kurt took over it is mostly extreme skiing.  No more mix of sports or funky skiing tricks in odd locations.  After the last two years I just tell my skier friends, ""have fun!"".  Too bad, most kids want to snow board these days.",1316044800,,404,4.194805194805195
7930382,5,B000053VF8,"I can't ski.  Neither can my younger sister....who was given full ski
gear by a rich friend one day.  But she just couldn't bend her legs
correctly.  ""This isn't your sport, is it?"", my sister's rich friend
said, kindly, finally.

But my mom was born in Montreal Canada -- and could ski!  So, naturally, I HAD to watch this documentary when I chanced upon it recently on TV.

Wow!  Skiers who scale the highest cliffs!  iSkiers who ski in unison, like the Radio City Rockettes!  Skiers
going down hill in unison, like a combination of a marching band and cheerleaders...(on skis!)  A helpful, enthusiastic commentary!  Snowboarding is also displayed!  Totally wonderful, for anyone who skis, knows someone who skis, or wants to see what the human spirit can happily produce!

Except for one spectacular skier, (who skis on ONE ski, WITHOUT poles!), all, or most, of these skiers, use two skis, and also use ski poles to help balance themselves.  I doubt that I'm the only person who realizes that not only skiers, but those who use crutches, use two ""poles"" to help balance themselves, and get around.  No -- crutches are NOT ski poles, and ski poles are NOT crutches.  But what both crutches and ski poles have in common, is that they are symbols of the ""indomidable Human Spirit"", which, if let free to do it's own thing, does truly wonderful things, indeed!

Whenever you feel you ""can't"" do something....watch this DVD!  It's spectacular skiing...and spectacular motivation.  Even if, like myself, you can't ski -- you will get inspiration and motivation to do the things YOU do best!

Highest recommendation!  Ten (or Twenty!) Stars ******************** : )",1217116800,,1662,4.885304659498208
7930383,3,B000053VF8,"If you're looking for the good old Warren Miller films, this isn't quite it.  This film is where Kurt, Warren's son, starts narrating most of the films, and he's really not very good at it, especially compared to Warren.  The film itself is decent, but not nearly as fun and exciting to watch as Fifty, Storm, or Cold Fusion, (or any of the older, classic Warren Miller films.)  In my opinion, this is one of the weaker films in the Warren Miller collection.  The narrating is bland, monotone, and quite annoying, and so is most of the music.  The skiing and boarding is pretty good, but, still not up to par with other Warren Miller films.  If you're planning on buying some, skip this one.",1161388800,6,691,4.488
7930384,3,B000053VF8,In our opinion there is no instructional value or race footage on this DVD. I can't see how this type of product is useful to learning to ski. There are much better videos out there for ski coaches.,1116374400,,198,4.2368421052631575
7930385,4,B000053VF8,"Gorgeous photography, varied and exotic locations from Whistler to New Zealand to Russia. Fabulous snowboard and ski footage, as always. Craig Kelly - ironically and prophetically talks about his love for riding in BC and what it's like to have sliders (avalanches) chase him down.

There's always a jot of humor in Warren's films, and we like it and expect it even if it's corny. Amusing to see the two brothers in the flatlands who construct a monster ski jump in their back yard.",1106524800,5,482,4.738095238095238
7930386,5,B000053VF8,"Unbelievable, awesome, spectacular, and incredible are just some of the words that come close to describing the breathtaking footage in this new ""classic"" form Warren Miller. Once again he makes you want to pack up and head for the nearest snow covered slopes, wherever in the world that might be. The scenery and cinematography is absolutely killer as is the selection of music that takes you on another dream trip through the best snowfields on earth. This film is an absolute ""must own"".",1060387200,8,490,4.9156626506024095
