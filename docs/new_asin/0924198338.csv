7793397,1,0924198338,"I bought this, incredibly excited to have finally found something about the Last Poets.  When I put it in the VCR, I found all but 2 minutes of it unwatchable.  The interview takes place back stage while a performance is going on and nobody has a mic.  The result is, you cannot hear the interview; only see people talking.  The video quality is poor to say the least.  Many home videos have better quality.
I'm glad that someone wanted to have the Last Poets tell us their story themselves, unfortunately, this story cannot be heard and is intolerable to even look at.",1050710400,3,569,4.53921568627451
