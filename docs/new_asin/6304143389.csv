8637379,4,6304143389,Although the production style is dated the information contained in this video is amazing.  One needs to look past the production work and look at what can be learned.  The entire video needs to be watched to learn Linda Tellington's technique.  Prior to using the Ttouch my dog Annie was very hyper and not able to relax.  Now using the Ttouch Annie will lie quietly.  The most amazing result is using this technique to clip her nails.  Annie will lie on her back and let me clip her nails effortlessly while a helper does the Ttouch on her.  You and your dog will be happy you bought this.,1081900800,5,591,4.416666666666667
