7287612,4,B00ZPV05A4,"LOVE slasher movies and this one delivers as far as the killer going after the usual, dumb (in this case, really dumb) characters. The locations were great and the bloody scenes were executed quite well. Not bad, except the last 15 or so minutes (they seemed to drag).",1436400000,3,268,4.604166666666667
7287613,2,B00ZPV05A4,"On the 20th anniversary of the Redwood massacre, 5 young adults opt to visit the farmhouse, located in Scotland. Mark (Adam Coutts) is with his new annoying girlfriend (Lisa Livingstone) who loathes the wilderness as well as being with Mark's catty ex-girlfriend (Rebecca Wilkie).

This is another slasher film with a killer who apparently resurrects like Jason, wears a burlap mask like the Texarkana Killer, and eats his victims alive like Hannibal. Pardon my feeling of Deja Vu while watching this slasher which does not distinguish itself either in the plot, acting, dialogue or characters.

7287633,2,B00ZPV05A4,"Well, it was a movie. The lead girl Pamela isn't bad at acting, she is actually quite good, the rest of the movie falls a bit flat.
The fake blood was a bit cheesy, the plotline was a bit underwhelming. It starts with a legend, about a guy who murders his family and eat them, and his son apparently roams the forest killing people/seeking revenge or something. So enter a group of campers, one is a girl who does not want to be there at all,(her name is Kristy) and only comes because her boyfriend asked her too, and she is actually the one who retells the legend of the redwood massacre. Her character is actually quite interesting too, just nothing is properly handled with her and Pamela. There's a bunch of violence but it seems cheap, and like they didn't even study where muscle tissue and things are. Which sounds petty, and it probably is, but i just hate when things seem super fake, or like they are murdering paper dolls or something. So maybe i should explain, some murder/slasher sequences go on for a very, very long time, and it's not because of torture or anything, and the people are still alive, while clearly their entire mid section has been stabbed a billion (okay, not a billion) times. The ending was a total let down as well. I wish i could have given it more stars, because it had promise, but it fell back onto a lot of cliches.
The Scenery/location was beautiful, the building that was used was stunning in a creepy way. The acting was well done, but the editing and storyline needed some work.",1458432000,,1523,4.462365591397849

7287669,3,B00ZPV05A4,"A group of young Scottish kids decide to go on a camping trip as per some slayings that took place 20 years ago.  In the group is the level-headed/sensible main girl Pamela(Lisa Cameron), Mark(Adam Coutts), Mark's acid-tongued and extremely annoying and hateful snob girlfriend Kirsty(Lisa Livingstone), their bike riding friend Bruce(Mark Wood), and Pamela's best friend Jessica(Rebecca Wilkie).  As everyone except for Bruce get together, they all gather around the campfire.  Showcasing some of her less than charming attitude, Kirsty tells them all the supposed real story of the killer.  The story was about some farmer that hears a voice tell him to kill his wife and kids, of which he not only does, but he also resorts to cannibalism.  After some drinking and partying around the campfire, they all call it a night.  The next day everyone but Pamela and Kirsty, turn up missing.  All told, a mysterious man is wandering around, a couple get murdered, Bruce is also missing, and total opposites like Pamela and Kirsty are forced to work together to find out what's going on.

I won't give away too much, but there are some ways by which this movie excels and some ways by which it doesn't live up to all of its potential.

Let's start with the gore.  The gore is exceptionally well done and plenty gruesome and realistic looking.  As for the chase and/or kill scenes, well the chase scenes had some excitement and intensity to them, albeit short chase scenes mostly.  The few that you get are pretty intense.  The violence employed here is very graphic and quite brutal.  There are also, scenes of torture and somewhat slow deaths for the victim.  You're not subjected to every last detail of what the killer does to his victims, but it comes close to that.  The torture scenes aren't drawn out to the extreme either.  The killers methods of killing come to more than just simple murder.  The downside is that the deaths of the victims were just too rushed.  Instead of killing them off one by one or something just as good they were all killed off in a hurry.  The suspense is hardly even established as well.

The cinematography is very beautiful and quite insolating too.  There's the woods, high grassy hills, dirt roads, and long meadows.  That's enough to give the characters hardly anywhere to run or hide.

The cast is attractive and interesting enough to catch the audiences attention.  The characters are just simple stereotypes, but if you get into the killings you probably won't think about that too much.

Unfortunately, there's are no sex scenes or nudity.  Also, shockingly there's no mention of sex or even dirty jokes of any kind.  Also, there's not much in the way of a party scene either.

Overall, this movie doesn't offer all the things that would've helped it to be better.  Certainly the legend of the crazy farmer could've been more elaborate, some nudity would've been nice, some humor wouldn't have hurt, the killer going after his victims in a less rushed fashion would've helped,  more suspense was needed, a less drawn out ending would've been vital also.  This is by no means a horrible movie, it is indeed entertaining in parts and is okay to watch like once in a while maybe.  In general it's just okay, but not great.  It's worth giving a try to see for yourself.

P.S. While there are scenes of torture in this movie, they're not as graphic as the ones used in the ""Saw franchise"".  As to whether that's a good thing or not, well that depends on you.",1447545600,2,3492,4.723509933774834

7287677,1,B00ZPV05A4,"As an ""American"" I am exposed to plenty of horrid movies like those offered up by the SyFy channel.  Some of those are very low budget and take themselves seriously, more recent ones don't and they go over well because they know they are jokes.

Low budge doesn't necessarily mean a bad experience...but in this case it is.  Aside from the basics like horrid cinematography and stereotypical audio, aka video game ""meat slash"" sound effect, this movie is filled with bad acting, on top of bad lines, on top of bad editing.

I won't spoil much but I'll go over what you might encounter if you're brave enough to waste your precious time.  You'll be entranced by the Caucasian femal actor who for some reason like drawn over shaven eyebrows that you'll swear are re-drawn every scene change.  You'll be reminded that everyone in this movie, including the ""heroine"" is a coward.  You'll ask yourself, wait, the bad guy just punched through someone's body and killed them that way...he doesn't need his axe or custom scimitar.

Then aside from all that, at the beginning of the movie, there is this guy, who appears to be tracking the bad guy, only to welcome a death...but he somehow was carrying around a shotgun...that he handed off to a complete stranger who nobody would assume could handle a firearm...the guy then dies...and the ""stranger heroine"" then somehow manages to get to this ""site"" and can work equipment that might be be able to save her...yeah....

And yeah...so that's that....if you're drunk or you have to waste time...this is one of those movies you can do such a thing.",1440201600,,1588,4.745454545454545

Since not that many good quality slashers have come out recently this was a welcome addition to keep the genre alive. I see some people on here rating it low because ""the characters lacked development"". Are they serious?? If they wanted character development, they should stick to watching dramas and romantic comedies. I usually watch horror movies for the villain and for the kills and this movie delivered on both of those fronts. The villain has a menacing look and his movement and kills are on par with the best of them. We haven't seen a new release from the best killers such as jason, freddy, chrome skull, or even Victor Crowley from hatchet, so it's about time we got a new slasher with a different villain.

This movie was an uphill struggle on a unicyle if the hill was a volcano. The characters were bland and unappealing, the plot near nonexistent and the logic as someone else had mentioned nowhere to be found. Small spoiler. At a point a battle hardened savior shows up and gives the shotgun with the only/last bullet his paycheck could afford him to an 18/17 year old girl. That's the kind of logic you're in for. And I stare at my screen wondering ""Why did they do that"" repeatedly.

The movie feelsl like it ends at a point just to grind out another painful 15 minutes for another token death and the greatest line I have ever heard in writing history.

8720602,3,B00ZPV05A4,"The Redwood Massacre bares striking resemblances to Friday the 13th Part II.  In the latter film, Jason Voorhees, the son of a maniac, was thought to have drowned in Crystal Lake, but he survived.  In The Redwood Massacre, the son of an insane farmer is butchered and buried in a shallow grave; however, his body disappears.  Both killers wear burlap sacks over their faces.

  I love slasher flicks of any era.  The Redwood Massacre begins with great promise.  Campers and hikers, alone or in groups of two and three, are being butchered in a beautiful forest.  Unfortunately, The Redwood Massacre quickly descends into modern day torture porn that is reminiscent of the Wrong Turn franchise.  Some of the characters make crazy, inane choices that get them killed.  All transgressions, however, could be forgiven if not for the silly twist near the end that could be seen a mile away.  Furthermore, the lead character makes a vulgar slur against farmers that is totally unnecessary.

  The streaming video from Amazon Video was presented in a widescreen HD version.  Audio and English captions are great.  The acting and production values are descent; at least the film doesnt look like it was made with someones iPhone.  Therefore, I will conclude with this:  For those who love slasher films with high body counts, The Redwood Massacre is decent late night viewing with beer and popcorn.",1471132800,,1390,4.965217391304348
