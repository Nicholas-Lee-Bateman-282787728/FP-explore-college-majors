6612620,5,B00N6X2ESY,"If you like camp you'll love Godzila Vs. Gegalon. It doesn't take itself to seriously so the political/environmental commentary just isn't there really. The battles are EPIC! Drop kicks should be in every Godzilla movie imho...though with CGI they would screw it up. Anyway, stick around for the kid breaking the bad guys nose by throwing a toy MIG airplane as well as the truckers driving around with naked women posters on their back window. I should also mention the robot Jag Jaguar because he's a big part of the story and a lot of fun. If you like Power Rangers or Masked Riders then you are in for a treat here as well!

Destroy all Monsters wasn't as fun for me as it was a long time ago. The political statements along with my current knowledge on the state of the world made the monsters seem off...Like Godzilla was saying, ""Here son...this is how you hate something different than you. Kill it!"" The aliens were killed but were they the right aliens or just some girls pretending to be aliens who were deadly so the real ones in the saucer would be killed? Who knows. Who knew the UN was a military force in the early 1970s? This one is heavy with a message (one proven wrong on several levels and right on the ones they NEVER really thought about...just fate) that will distract you from the final monster battle at the end.

One word - Dolphins.",1414972800,3,1359,4.475806451612903

6612622,5,B00N6X2ESY,"Must own if your upgrading to Blu Ray. Great transfer on both movies. There's a small film glitch on g vs megalon at the bottom of the screen, but I've seen the glitch in other transfers so it's not the blu. Destroy all monsters is a great movie and  looks great so get them both!!!!",1414108800,10,283,4.1454545454545455
6612623,5,B00N6X2ESY,"These are two of the best OG  ( original godzilla ) films. They are from 1968 & 1973 and these dvd's are great ! They are well made, full length versions and not edited . They are in both original and english versions and have very good sound quality and the images are clear and crisp too. I love this stuff and if you don't have these two films in your collection , get them . You won't be disappointed .",1500163200,7,406,4.012345679012346

6612626,5,B00N6X2ESY,Great video quality,1496534400,,19,5.666666666666667
6612627,4,B00N6X2ESY,"Well what do you know, after all this time hearing about Godzilla vs Megalon with Jet Jaguar I finally get to see the movie and realize, I've seen it before.  Well, I've seen the opening up to where the kid is in a goofy looking paddle boat.  I remember the rescue and I didn't remember the rest of the movie.  It's downstairs on VHS somewhere.  I watched it with my son and must have blanked it out with all the power rangers he used to watch back then.  Man, that was a long time ago.  The movie had video issues at parts but the only things I thought hard to see was the night time scenes where the characters were not especially well lit.  Usually the movie will set up a scene that's ""at night"" and you'll see birds flying, bright noon shadows and all the likes.  Not this one, they wanted you to know it was night time.  The headlights on the cars looked good, the rest was a little dim.  This is kid era Godzilla and the fight scenes were, as I said, right out of Power Rangers even though this was 25 years earlier then them.  It was a fun Godzilla style movie.
Destroy all Monsters.  I HAVE seen this one before and I'll enjoy watching it tonight.  This is the movie that gives this a 4 out of 5 rating.  It didn't work, on my PC.  Because I can't watch Blu-Ray on my PC and this is a mismarked Blu-Ray not DVD Disc.  Oh, the menu is spinning downstairs and I've jumped through some scenes real quick but I'm confident it will be fine.  Video quality is much better, but it's still a Godzilla movie from he kiddie era.  Love me some big guy from any of the eras, don't get me wrong, even though it makes me a 54 year old dork.  But like John Wayne movies, it takes me back to a time when I was younger and if you couldn't figure out who the hero was in a John Ford movie, you'll have no problems figuring it out in a Godzilla movie.  Shoot, the kid actually suggests sending Jet Jaguar to go get Godzilla to save the day.  Seems to me I remember Raymond Burr getting stomped by him, when the ruined Gojira by putting old Ironsides in it.
Get the marking right or get the right disc in the box, either way its the only complaint I have.  A nice price for both videos.",1495238400,3,2175,4.104265402843602

6612630,4,B00N6X2ESY,"Great movies! The picture is okay could be better, but its probably the best its going to be. The movies are good for different reasons, Godzilla vs megalon has some stock footage but still a good movie, Godzilla Destroy All Monsters is good but probably not the best in kaiju fighting.",1463443200,4,286,4.627450980392157

6612633,5,B00N6X2ESY,"Excellent. I'm a huge Godzilla fan so I may be a little biased. The Blu Ray Transfer was nice and it was good to see these movies in Japanese (English Subtitles) for the first time. Godzilla vs Megalon was difficult and expensive to find on DVD so this is a great deal and I was able to replace my DVD copy of Destroy All Monsters with Blu Ray. Again, the movies looks fantastic, probably the best they'll be able to get them.",1441929600,7,426,4.2073170731707314

6612636,5,B00N6X2ESY,"""Classic"" monster movies with a fresh coat of paint.  Both movies are cheesy and the dubbing is okay.  Nice print but if you have a really high end television, you will see the imperfections.  Still, nice conversion though.",1428624000,2,223,4.815789473684211

8676445,5,B00N6X2ESY,"I had this on VHS 25 years ago and loved it despite poor inage and sound. Got the DVD in 2001 and it was actually worse.
This version is light years ahead of those.
Image clarity reveals so many things you just could not see in other releases. The screen isn't cropped, and theres scenes that were deleted.
BEAUTIFUL",1531353600,,316,4.372881355932203

8676451,5,B00N6X2ESY,"Both excellent prints of these old movies but for me the best one was Destroy All Monsters. This is mainly because 'Godzilla vs Megalon' seems to show a white line at the very bottom of the screen from scene-to-scene. Almost like when you used to pause a vhs video. Not sure if this is an editing issue, but if you look down at the bottom of the screen as it goes from shot to shot you can see this odd white line flash very quickly. I was viewing these movies on a 100"" projector screen, so this issue via a tv may not be so obvious. The movie itself is a good print as well but D.A.M is (for me) the perfect of the two that doesnt share this odd issue. Overall, great films and until someone else releases better prints (if that's possible), I can't recommend them highly enough!",1510272000,4,781,4.213333333333333
8676452,5,B00N6X2ESY,"Destroy all Monsters is really good. You're shown the monsters attacking cities around the world and then fighting King Ghidorah at the end.
Godzilla vs Megalon however, is awful. The film was only done in a month and it showed. I mean it has a boring car chase, and the fight versus Megalon and Gigan is not as good as it should be. I still think the package deal is good and you shouldn't pass it up. Just skip G vs M and you'll be fine.",1503273600,2,439,4.116279069767442
