949061,3,6304983786,"This offering from George Romero is very flawed , but can also be entertaining , and exciting. The overdone story of a contagious virus taking over a small town is overshawdowed by the menacing army in white bio suits who use their granted martial law to evacuate everyone into the highschool while the locals fight back. Some of the best scenes include the old women stabbing the soilder with the knitting needles , the intense and disturbing scene where a infected father and daughter engage in incest , the woman sweeping the grass as a gun fight between locals and the army is happening around her. But however the film can sometimes be slow and drag on , the acting is tedious , and the drum score through the whole film gets irratating quickly...not to mention a very lame ""ending"" that left me feeling ripped off. I'd check it out if you're a horror or Romero buff , along with his other films The Living Dead Series , Martin , Monkey Shines , and Creepshow.",1017100800,,965,4.52
949062,1,6304983786,"A little while ago I lost a bet with a friend of mine and I had to watch this movie.
  The plot is ,I thought, a good one. The water system get's contaminated by a virus that drives everyone in the town crazy. I seem's that the government has developed this as a wepon and it mistakenly was dumped. The army come's in and from there the movie is a mess. George Ramero of Night of the living dead fame is the director and it is his worst outing. There are too many slow motion shots that are not needed and distracting. The acting never get's above awful. This was a film that I wanted to see at first now I wish I never did...By the way this movie's plot is similar to a movie in the 80's called Impulse with Meg Tilly and Tim Matheson and it is a much better film.

949063,4,6304983786,"This film often gets judged harshly merely because when one thinks of Romero, one thinks of his Living Dead trilogy.  Unlike his other none zombie films such as Martin and Knight Riders this film has true artistic merit.
A top secret virus developed by the army is accidently unleashed on a unexpecting town and chaos quickly takes over as the army struggles to contain the virus.
The citizens of the town are driven mad by the virus and go on killing sprees of epic rampage. It seems no one is immune or safe.  Even a nice elderly grandmother stabs a solider through the heart with a knitting needle as he tries to help her.
The virus seems to bring out the dark surpressed urges of all those who are exposed to it.  One father even tries to rape his own daugther in a rather intense scene.  The ""End of the World"" feel of this film cannot be ignored.  It is easily on the level of Dawn of the Dead though Dawn will always be without question Romero's ultimate masterpiece.
A top notch film from one of the masters of the genre George Romero, this film is a must for any fan of ""End of the World"" movies and an excellent edition to any horror collection.",980726400,3,1155,4.3534883720930235

949154,5,6304983786,"Excellent job of remastering from Lustig's BLUE UNDERGROUND company (one of the few historical film companies that still care about the quality of B-movie presentations on digital format), and the film itself--easily one of Romero's more hectic efforts--comes closer to greatness in its narrative than ""Night of the Living Dead"" even. I have not watched the remake of this title because I don't care to watch films that I can't follow easily; the original is leisurely paced, gripping, and obviously more focused upon character than upon ridiculous special effects. The transfer onto DVD is immaculate and rewarding viewing, if you enjoy these older exploitation titles.
The DVD's best extra is the commentary track by Lustig and Romero, both of whom enjoy themselves quite a bit while watching the film again. Romero offers insights for today's filmmakers (although, like Cohen, he isn't particularly optimistic about the business any longer) as well as pointing out the numerous technical errors that this film contains; he mentions the problems involved with creating special effects, eye-line shots, rapid editing techniques, etc. Overall, this audio commentary is worth a listen and is quite informative too. It is amazing how much of an effective world that Romero was able to build merely through the power of extras and editing techniques. (Although Paul McCollough's script was apparently overhauled and reshaped by Romero into his own personal story, it would be interesting to read the original source work entitled ""The Mad People"".) Romero knows how to make commercials and documentary films, and his efforts at shaping a unique visual style are on full display here.
Overall, a quality DVD release, and certainly an interesting stop along the back-roads of horror fiction on film (although this is an older offering and, unlike these silly remakes, one must pay attention to story and characters in order to become invested in the movie).

The military, or what appears like extras in cheap army clothing, start to order martial law except a few hot headed guys break out.

949184,4,6304983786,"The small town of Evan's City is placed under quarantine when a deadly infection is accidentally released into the water supply by the government. The biological weapon drives people incurably mad before killing them outright, forcing hapless government officials to use deadly force in order to prevent the disease from spreading. In the wake of Vietnam, America's trust in the offending government had already been shaken, but fringe filmmakers like George Romero continued to push the envelope and question the status quo. THE CRAZIES is an outright attack on government inadequacies in the face of a major disaster, painting the military machine as a ruthless and uncaring regime against which the common citizen holds no chance. The threat of biological warfare and collateral damage occurring on American soil was a fresh new idea in cinema at the time, creating quite a stir in audiences with a terrifyingly realistic scenario that hits frightfully close to home. Mindless soldiers carrying out deadly commands without question, government spinsters working out elaborate cover-ups, the ever-present threat of a nuclear solution... Each of these things amount to an American nightmare, and one that could conceivably happen at any time. In THE CRAZIES, George Romero has exposed us to the fear of a government gone wild using the modern medium of film with the same fiery intent as the classic abolitionists of England and France.

I say used to be, because it simply was the only game in town at the time it came out. Then Omega man with charlton heston and several other disease based movies came out that trumped this movie in every way except one. The one way this movie succeeds today in my mind, is in the on location filming, which in some scenes added a bit of flavor to it you usually cant find, im speaking of the outside scenes but they eventually degrade into small rooms inside buildings with lots of boring talk.

949214,4,6304983786,"Sometimes I wonder if George Romero could be one of those mainstream directors who can operate in Hollywood like Wes Craven. Romero's best films are most definitely his older fare while trying to adapt to this formula in the modern age after Land of the Dead has resulted in the disappointing but well thought out Diary of the Dead, and what is supposedly his worse recieved movie Survival of the Dead. Sure He's made movies like Creepshow and Monkeyshines in the eighties but for my money his best movies were made in the seventies, films like Martin and The Crazies.
Looking back at it The Crazies might not seem the best of his movies. You really don't have anything like Zombies, or vampires to see as the horror and most people unaccustomed to the film might end up calling it a cheaper version of Outbreak. But in a way with Romero's political streak in view with not so subtle allegory and metaphor, in my opinion its one of his more interesting films. The idea of a virus, something unseen that can attack anyone without a mask or knife is good use of preying on a more realistic fear. The fact that it turns its victims into mindless crazy psychopaths is an interesting idea for what could be considered villains. But then the army shows up trying to secure an already volatile situation created by them (the virus is a man made bioweapon unleashed when a plane crashes)and starts shooting citizens who've gone mad then you really have no true villains, just people reacting to their circumstances. These scenes are interspersed with Romero's criticsm showing government who keep debating on dropping a nuke on the town, or a doctor not given the equipment and cooperation He needs to find a cure for the virus.
The movie unlike some of Romero's more famous films has a more harder feel to it and to me thats one of its charms in a way. Theres not a whole lot of gore on display so the characters and their situations take more precedence over more horrific things. Its not the greatest film ever but I like the independent feel it exhudes even when the story is a bit heavy handed.
The DVD itself from Blue Underground is well produced. There is a Blu-Ray on the way before the remake hits in February which seems to have the identical features. For a low budget movie the DVD itself does have excellent picture and sound, and the features are good for such a small unheard of picture.

949217,2,6304983786,"With the announcement that George Romero is planning on a 2009 remake, I decided to watch the original 1973 version of ""The Crazies"".  Not only was I incredibly disappointed, but it's so bad that I had a hard time believing it came from the great mind of Romero.

A plane carrying a bio-weapon codenamed ""Trixie"" accidentally releases the cargo on the unsuspecting town of Evan's City, Pennsylvania.  It turns out the side-affects of this weapon are certain insanity, a nearly guaranteed fatality, and indescribably bad acting.  The government is in a wild frenzy trying to quarantine the town and contain the virus.

There really isn't a lot to like about ""The Crazies"".  The actors are poor at best, with two of the main characters looking like shaved versions of the Geico cavemen.  In tune with their appearances, the lines are delivered in abrupt Cro-Magnon like grunts and meaningless monosyllabic blasts.  The drama is nonexistent as they meander about the town with three other characters who are clearly using the opportunity to audition as the undead for Romero's next zombie flick.  They must evade the institution of martial law, the inevitable spread of the virus, and seemingly overzealous Army occupation.

The other half of the movie is a jumbled, incohesive mess, as a nondescript member of the military argues with an incompetent scientist - who insists on screaming EVERY LINE - about the need for inoculations and voice recognition over CB radio, as non-connected scenes and stock footage provide the antithesis of what a script and acting should look like, not to mention the atrociously incomplete ending.

It's boring, bland, and somewhat irritable, and there is no doubt that the remake is slotted to right past wrongs.  I trust Romero will make amends.",1228003200,,1777,5.0479452054794525

The residents who come into contact with whatever the plane carried either die or go insane. Of course the government bungles the containment and a few protagonists attempt to escape the town. There are a few humorous moments, intentional and otherwise. The film is clearly a Romero flop.  Of course, if you relate it to FEMA incompetency in recent disasters, it makes its own kind of sense.  And, as in most Romero films, human incompetency is much scarier than an alien monster. If I hadn't lived in Evans City, PA, I probably would have rated ""Crazies"" as only 1 star, but seeing my former neighbors go insane, made me realize that Geroge Romero may have known, all along, what I had only suspected about the residents, leaving me with a tiny bit of self-satisfaction.",1175299200,,954,4.740963855421687
949222,2,6304983786,"""The Crazies"" (1973) was George Romero's attempt to get a little more low-budget mileage out of his ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1971) zombie-like stuff by blending it with elements from ""The Andromeda Strain"" (1971).

A germ warfare bug is accidentally released into the water supply of a small western Pennsylvania town named  Evans City (where it was actually filmed). It turns some into placid zombie-like creatures and some into out-of-control maniacs. The Army comes in and imposes martial law and the local civilians do a good imitation of the zombies from ""Night of the Living Dead"".

The cast is a bunch of locals (western PA/NE Ohio) who fortunately for us all with low thresholds of pain did little acting after this project. Poor acting combines with poor editing to make it impossible to determine who among the citizens and the troops has the disease, is just stressed out, or is just trying to party hard. Romero's direction is extremely weak and he has trouble throughout keeping the cast in character.

Romero had discovered with ""Night of the Living Dead"" that there was serious exploitation potential in stories about the breakdown of society and this is where he really tries to focus his film. There is an underlying theme of social commentary as this was the time of serious social protests (Kent State just across the state line), distrust of the federal government, and our winding down involvement in Viet Nam. Romero was also drawing from his fascination with 1950's sci-fi themes regarding irresponsible science.

Unfortunately the best aspect of ""Night of the Living Dead"", its simplicity, is sacrificed as Romero has just enough resources to turn the film into an exercise in excess. There are several tangential plot points (voice recognition systems, a B-52 with a nuclear warhead, a frustrated scientist) that go nowhere but use up a lot of time getting there.

But these obvious problems are not the film's ultimate downfall. That comes from the film's lack of organization on the most fundamental level; which means it is extremely boring.  No suspense is generated because there is no sense of progress or advancement of the storyline. Instead the same three basic scenes are repeated over and over until Romero is able to cobble together a feature length production. There are a handful of civilians trying to evade the Army troops, there are a handful of Army officers whining about how difficult their job is, and there are a handful of national security advisers back in Washington tossing around doom and gloom predictions. The film simply alternates between these three groups, with the segments completely interchangeable. The editor could have assembled them in any order and they would have not altered the flow of the story.

There are a couple of unexpectedly stylish scenes to watch for; the shooting of the flower child girl in the pasture, with a flock of sheep passing quietly in the foreground. And the infected woman with a broom sweeping the grass.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1163030400,,3047,4.970530451866405

949265,4,6304983786,"George Romero's non-'Dead' films are, as a whole, under appreciated, but probably none of them is in more dire need of greater recognition than 'The Crazies'.  It's not a perfect film, by any means, but it's well done, considering the budgetary restraints, and ranks as perhaps his bleakest and most ambitious film, and is an interesting bridge between his inital masterpiece `Night of the Living Dead' and the later ones `Martin' and `Dawn of the Dead'. (The equally obscure `Season of the Witch' is also found in this era.  It's a heavily flawed film, but better than you might think.)

The film involves the unintended contamination of Evans City with an experimental bio-weapon named Trixie.  Needless to say, the virus causes the victims to go insane, though this can mean a lot of things ranging from homicidal rage to suicide to sheer goofiness.  The military is called in to keep things contained, but the situation is clearly out of hand.  'The Crazies' is particularly ambitious because it shows the tragedy from a variety of angles: We primarily identify with a lone group of towns people who just wanna get the hell out of there, but we also get to know the central military command of the operation, the leadership on the ground, the scientists who both created the virus and are trying to now find a sort of cure, all while seeing plenty of conflict between the ill-informed soldiers and the other towns people, both crazy and normal.  The film is particularly interesting in that it has no real villains.  The military people are not overwhelmingly scrupulous in their conduct, but they are rarely truly malevolent either. (And the head of the operation proves to be one of the most likable characters in the film.)  Furthermore, though they largely botch the operation, they aren't really portrayed as especially incompetent either.  It's just a bad, bad situation, and a lotta people are gonna end up dead no matter how you go about it. (This, in the end, actually makes the film more bleak, as it seems likely that things would've gone very badly no matter what anyone did.)  Conversely, though we more naturally identify with the civilians, they are partially to blame for the extreme difficulty of the situation as they are so utterly defensive and untrusting.  Thru all this a major theme from `Night of the Living Dead' recurs: lack of and inability to communicate, which leads to virtual war between the military and the remaining civilians.

This movie was really made on the cheap, but it's sufficiently competent from a technical standpoint.  The acting isn't fantastic, but as far as the low-budget 70's horror goes, it ain't bad. It's also ahead of its time, with lots of frantic, rapid fire editing, though it never becomes irritating and incoherent, as modern films so often do. The film has quite a few  action scenes, and they're often pretty primitive but effective in their way.  These scenes are more about violence and destruction rather than excitement, so they don't really need to work in the way that these kind of scenes traditionally do.  As is typical of early Romero, he pulls no punches and defies traditional rules of what you can and can't do in a movie.  (To wit: In the opening scene of the film a little girl pulls down the sheets on a bed to discover the blood stained corpse of her mother, and it's all downhill from their, culminating in some really rather inappropriate behavior between father and daughter in a scene late in the film.)  This sorta thing works especially well because it never feels self-conscious.  Romero doesn't seem to be aware of what would or would not be considered appropriate, nor does he seem to be being actively transgressive.  He's just showing it the way it happened. (Compare this to `Outbreak' which some accuse of being a knockoff.  Notice all the lame Hollywood crap in that movie and the hilariously EVIL government dude.  I dunno whether or not that movie ripped `The Crazies' off, but I do know that it totally sucked.  By the way, they are currently planning on remaking `The Crazies'.  Many people are opposed to this, but I'm glad.  First of all, it'll allow this movie to get greater exposure, as it is really quite obscure right now, and it's apparently gonna be directed by the obviously talented Brad Anderson, so it has a good chance of turning out well, provided that they are reasonably faithful to the tone and themes of the original.  Which, of course, they may not.)

The film has an odd soundtrack, largely marching snare drums and `When Johnny Comes Marching Home', no doubt inspired by `Dr. Strangelove'.  While thematically appropriate, the music does get a little tiresome after a while.  Still, not to big of a deal.

The Blue Underground DVD is pretty nice.  The transfer looks a lot better than you'll usually get for a film of this sort, and the commentary track was rather entertaining and interesting, as it typically is from Romero films.  Anyway, I like this movie. Check it out.

949266,5,6304983786,"After coming out of nowhere with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in 1968 Pittsburgh director George Romero made two flops that no one has ever heard of, THERE""S ALWAYS VANILLA and SEASON OF THE WITCH. Then  in 1973 his financially strapped indie distributors begged him to make another ""horror"" film and for a paltry 270, 000 dollars he went to Evans City, PA and made THE CRAZIES.  Its about an accidental bio-warfare spill that drives people crazy(you seeing where Danny Boyle got some inspiration for 28 Days Later?) and the Army's disastrous attempt at containment. Watching it today one is struck by its relentlessly downbeat tone and the power of the imagery;  i was amazed at the hard-headedness; no one is spared unjustifiably to satisfy the demands of an audience--this is the 70's, remember--its got scenes that, in todays climate, seriously resonate: bio-suited soldiers taking over a small town, dragging screaming children from their beds, shooting escapees in the back; this has to be the most outright anti-militarist film from the early 70's besides PUNISHMENT PARK.  This is heavy stuff, especially seen in the light of our current domestic situation,where police and military intrusions upon everyday life are becoming more and more ""normal"". You've got to hand it to George Romero, he doesn't pull any punches; At one point he has some civilians saying to our protagonists, "" Let's wait for the army to help us!"" to which one of the heroes, a vietnam veteran, replies,
""The army ain't anyone's friend, we know--we were in it!""  For a film that originally came out in 1973 that line is not only prescient but brave;THE CRAZIES is unsparing in its depiction of the lunacy of the armed forces--even the soldiers themselves recognize it--in this way the film is similar in spirit to CATCH 22 and its chilling to think about how the entire concept was considered pretty far-fetched upon its first release--even though it was inspired by true events in Utah in which a cannister of nerve gas fell from an army truck and killed a bunch of cattle (also the subject of George C Scotts directorial debut, RAGE 1972. ) and to then realize how familiar, dare i say COMFORTABLE we are with these kinds of concepts today after the cult attacks in  the tokyo subways in the 90's and all our current preoccupations with bio-warfare,dirty bombs and Homeland Security.
This is an excellent edition of this long unavailable film; It looks the best it probably ever has since it was first barely released in theatres back in '73. The commentary by George Romero
is hilarious and very entertaining as well as very informative. There is a big-budget remake scheduled for 2006 and I, for one, can't wait.  If its anything like the fantastic 2004 remake of Romero's Dawn of the Dead, it will be awesome! THE CRAZIES remains one of the most potent indictments against out of control militarism that has ever been made in America and its also a gripping adventure story, told with style and ingenuity.",1135814400,39,2987,4.868110236220472
949267,4,6304983786,"A deadly government made virus called ""Code: Trixie"" has just been unleashed into a Pennslyvania town called ""Evan's City"" as it contaminates some people as the effects are either death or insanity that leads them to kill people. However the local army and scientists are working on a cure as they must give vaccines to some of the non-infected people of the town. A few people such as a Vietnam vet with his pregnant wife secretly have to flee the virus and the deadly infected folk.

Interesting Sci-fi action horror thriller from the creator of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"" George A. Romero that has his trademark brand of social satire mixed with horror elements and there are good themes about biological warfare including the effects of what it could do to people. Cult actress Lynn Lowrey, Richard France (Dawn of the Dead 1978) and Richard Liberty (Day of the Dead) co-star in this chilling action packed movie of paranoia and militant fear.

The DVD has good picture and sound quality with that nice remastering that ""Blue Underground"" always does to cult movies! A good audio commentary by George Romero is here with some nice extras like an interview with legendary Lynn Lowrey, poster-and-still gallery, George Romero bio, TV Spots and Trailers.

949268,4,6304983786,"THE CRAZIES was filmed during the time between Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAWN OF THE DEAD. This film certainly has more in common with DAWN in terms of pacing and editing. THE CRAZIES benefits from a lightning-fast pace and over-the-top editing which keeps you glued to the screen. The story is essentially your ""small town is exposed to a lethal virus and quarantined"" plot. We follow 5 people as they try to dodge the military and escape the town, but marshal law is declared and the military begin slaughtering the civilians, infected or not.

This film has so much in common with DAWN OF THE DEAD in terms of overall feel and production, that if you love DOTD, as most horror fans do, you really can't go wrong with THE CRAZIES.",1125100800,7,744,4.552238805970149
949269,5,6304983786,"The Crazies was a film that George A. Romero made around the ""Cambist period"".  During this time he had three of his films released by Cambist: There's Always Vanilla, Jack's Wife and The Crazies.  There's Always VAnilla didn't do so well but Cambist's owner Lee Hessel wanted Romero to make a horror film.  So with a very small budget,

a group of stage actors and a LOT of volunteers, Romero went to the small Pennsylvania town of Evan's City and made a tale about a biological weapon that was accidentally released into the town's water supply.

The Crazies is a bueraucratic nightmare.  The military and the government is helpless and the townspeople are very unco-opertative.  There's no other choice but to put the town under quarrantine and martial law.  Forget about Outbreak, this is a real urban plague horror show.  Within the contaminated zone, are two volunteer firefighters, a nurse and a father and daughter.  Can they break through the Army's perimeter or will they become victims of the virus?

Blue Underground out did themselves with this special edition D.V.D.  The transfer is phenomonal and the commentary track with Romero and Blue Underground's owner Willam Lustig is superb.  The other extras are a short

documentary about 70's B-Movie Queen Lynn Lowery, a bio-page about George A. Romero and a couple of trailers.

I you loved Night of the Living Dead then you'll dig The Crazies.  Remember this is a Romero film so expect dialog,

story, poltical critque and  nice pacing.

Highly recommended.",1120003200,3,1521,4.964285714285714

The editing is poor, the special effects are not special nor really effects, and so on. The acting is better than most of the rest of the movie. It might have been okay during that timeframe, but pales for anything today.

949271,2,6304983786,"This low budget zombie-esque film is a complete waste of time, I rented it thinking that it would at least have some frightening moments but what I got instead was a test in patience. The details concern a toxic agent released by some dumb witted morons in the army in a small town and soon everyone gets the disease. The military, or what appears like extras in cheap army clothing, start to order martial law except a few hot headed guys break out. Each time the military is shown on the screen, Romero has some corny drum beating like we are too stupid to figure out that the army is there. Absolutely no suspense and an awful ending to boot....",1102723200,3,648,4.408333333333333
949272,2,6304983786,"Talk, talk, and more talk; with some action scenes randomly inserted. I felt like I was watching C-SPAN with a bad science fiction twist. The movie delves too much in wordy technical political blunders. I wish Romero were more clever in incorporating the social satire with the action as he has done with Dawn and Night. The movie is as bland as a licking a paper plate. The real problem here was the dialogue. I felt like I had to trim fat off a piece of meat to get to the real message underneath this sea of people talking in a room. The movie felt as if it never ventured beyond the same rooms the entire time.
We hear so much about how the virus is so dangerous, yet this point was never illustrated. We do see the corruption of the army just when they break into people's homes and quarantine them and when they go into mild gunfights. That's about it and it only makes a small fraction of the entire movie. It was basically the army and some doctor switching back and forth with arguments about the virus and blah blah blah. There's too much excruciating detail delivered only in words.
Part of the brilliance in filmmaking is using visuals to convey a message in imaginative ways. And there's nothing imaginative about seeing people argue in a little room for hours. I found the arguments between the ""rebels"" more appealing than the army's. But it still didn't hold up for the entire film. The whole movie revolves around some black army guy arguing with some bearded scientist most of the time. The people who were on the run were secondary, even though I found them more exciting.
""The Crazies"" is a movie only for Romero collectors, such as myself. Other than that, I recommend you just get Martin, Creepshow, Dawn, or Night, because this will disappoint you if you were looking for a crazy thriller or political horror film. I do give credit though for Romero's ambition to try and convey a message about Vietnam and the Cold War paranoia, no matter how dull it came out on screen and for that one scene where a guy gets shot through the head, which emphasizes the cruel nature, the characters are in.",1085443200,4,2114,4.522193211488251
949300,5,6304983786,"This film by George Romero is a fantastically tense movie about when the water supply becomes contaminated and it affects the town that relies on the water supply.
The opening scene is quite possibly one of the most horrific I have ever seen. A brother is trying spook his sister out and his sister doesn't like it. She goes to tell mommy while the boy finds out that dad has gone mad pouring kerosene all over the house. The little girl is still trying to wake mommy up when she pulls the sheet off to find that mommy has an axe in her neck! Soon enough dad has set the house on fire and is outside while the rest of his family are left to burn.
The scenes with governmental agencies are complicated. Nobody understands anything, everybody is at each others throats and the main line which illustrates this all is when one doctor incensed by the lack of control he is allowed on this is "" I cannot believe how shoddy this has been organized ""
The mayhem in this movie doesn't let up. What with priests setting themselves on fire and a granny stabbing an army soldier with a knitting needle ( genuinely frightening and perhaps one of the most surprising scenes of all )
The end will definitely leave you confused but I won't say too much more. I've given enough
Incidentally I'm surprised this flopped at the box office. It really is a good intelligent horror movie. But then I guess when people think of horror movies they tend to think of those big dumb Hollywood horror movies with absolutely no shock value whatsoever ( "" it's all gore they want "" ). Yes this film is graphic in places but is done so with more thought and precise control even when it's method is in chaos. And also I can't believe this is the same director who gave us the atrocious Creepshow 1 & 2! What was Georgie thinking?",1073347200,7,1798,4.38622754491018
949301,5,6304983786,"George Romero's contributions to the horror genre are legendary. Here is the guy who made ""Night of the Living Dead"" in the late 1960s, single-handedly bringing flesh-eating zombies into the lexicon of millions of horror fans. Two sequels followed with differing levels of success, but Romero's zombie films also inspired several Italian directors, most notably Lucio Fulci and Umberto Lenzi, to churn out a plethora of grue drenched films featuring the shambling dead. Of course, Romero didn't just sit around during the intervals between zombie films; he made other films that, while not as well known as the trilogy of ""Dead"" films, are eerie in there own right. One of these movies is ""The Crazies,"" sometimes referred to by its alternate title ""Codename: Trixie"" (a title I like better, for some inexplicable reason). I sing the praises of the DVD revolution in nearly every movie review I write, but seeing an early Romero film with some extra goodies really makes my day. Getting background on a film like this one would never have been possible in the old VHS days.
""The Crazies,"" shows the deadly implications of a biological weapons accident on a small American town named Evans City, Pennsylvania. An army plane carrying a weapons grade virus known as Trixie crashes in a field outside of town. The military dispatches a team of specialists and cleaners to inspect the damage, and the technicians do their thing and declare the area safe for the residents. In typical paranoid, Vietnam era style, the military hides the potential dangers of the crash, but since no contamination took place the only results are a few wiped brows and some sighs of reassurance. Only a small circle of military high ups will ever realize how close America came to total destruction, for Trixie is a highly communicable virus with no known cure. What a relief!
You didn't think it would end there, did you? C'mon, this is a Romero film! As it turns out, a small quantity of Trixie did leak into the town's water supply. By the time the military realizes this actuality, some of the residents in town start showing signs of infection: a pasty complexion and a propensity to suddenly indulge in bloody violence. The army answers with a bunch of troops decked out in white detox suits armed with automatic weapons. The colonel in charge of the town quickly sets up a quarantine line around the town in an effort to stop the spread of Trixie, but try as he might, he simply lacks the necessary manpower and equipment to know for sure if his efforts are working. No one knows if Trixie moved beyond the borders of the town between the time of the crash to the first signs of infection. Since the army needs to keep the townspeople placated, they put a tight rein on any potentially damaging information. As long as the townspeople play like good little American citizens, everything will turn out for the best. As for Trixie, the army brings in a doctor who helped build the virus in the laboratory, and he starts working on a vaccination right away despite his pessimism about the communicability of the virus and the high probability that it did indeed escape the town's borders. His only hope is to find someone with immunity to the disease and thereby acquire the necessary immunological materials needed to fashion a cure.
Unfortunately for the army, one of the locals is a nurse at the doctor's office. She quickly learns what's going on and takes off to find her husband, a firefighter who is currently battling a blaze that resulted because a Trixie victim went on a rampage. The husband has a few questions himself before he ever meets up with his wife: why are there soldiers dressed in detox suits exchanging gunfire with a local? Why is it so tough to get any answers about what is going on in town? Eventually, husband and wife hook up with a few other locals and the group decides to make a break for the edge of town. The biggest problem with this plan is that several people in the group have Trixie and are slowly wasting away as the hours pass. Simultaneously, the town descends into anarchy, with soldiers and locals blazing away at each other with firearms and explosives. ""The Crazies"" concludes with the customary Romero ambiguity, as we wonder what will happen to the rest of the country if and when Trixie gets loose.
""The Crazies"" is a low budget production that manages to put across a chilling scenario of ""what if""? The soldiers do look ominous in those containment suits, and the performances of the cast are quite good considering the no name talent, with special mention going to Lynn Lowry, an amazingly sexy Sissy Spacek look alike who plays Kathy Bolan, a young lady infected with Trixie. Her death scene constitutes one of the more memorable, and upsetting, scenes in the film. A few good gun battles help move the film along, as does the occasional cutaway to officials in Washington, D.C. who consider dropping a nuclear bomb on the town if it looks like Trixie will spread. What really helps the DVD version of the film are the extras: a short interview with Lynn Lowry, a commentary track with Romero, trailers, tons of production stills from the movie, and an informative George Romero biography. ""The Crazies"" might well be low budget '70s fare, but it's never cheesy thanks to a claustrophobic atmosphere, capable performances, and a great plot.",1062892800,7,5373,4.778494623655914
949302,5,6304983786,"What I love about Romero movies (meaning the ""Dead"" series and the ""Crazies"") is that when you remove the horror there is always a great underlying story about group dynamics.  The Crazies delievers on this.  It is one of the reasons I find myself constantly going back and watching these movies again and again ... And, yes, I watch them for the gore too.",1061510400,2,356,4.546875
949303,4,6304983786,"What a shame that we don't have more of a culture of independent filmmaking in this country.  ""The Crazies"" is not ""Citizen Kane"", but Romero completists will appreciate this fine presentation.  You won't find the script and production values of ""The Andromeda Strain"", but if you enjoy out-of-control virus thrillers, then this film is a good choice.  It's an odd bridge between the bleak horror of ""Night of the Living Dead"" and the apocalyptic farce of ""Dawn of the Dead"".

As expected, many classic Romero themes begin to formulate in this early film.  The replacement of one society by another, with the ""new"" society simply expressing exaggerated characteristics of the ""old"".  We see a bureaucratized, inefficient government that ends of doing far more harm than good.  And of course we see the usual two-dimensional negative depiction of military characters.  (This has always been a weakness in Romero's word - we know the government is bad, why underscore that point with a bad cliche).

Like almost all of his work, Romero filmed this in the Pittsburgh area largely with local talent.  The acting is hit-and-miss...but Romero takes some interesting risks, especially in light of its age.  In terms of directing, writing, and cinematography, Romero accomplished a great deal with very limited resources. There are some images you won't forget...an insane grandmother killing a soldier with knitting needles is more disturbing than it sounds, for example.

I run hot and cold towards Romero's films. He's had some excellent success, and some profound failures - but in general, there should be more filmakers like him.  I'd much rather see something as risk-taking as ""The Crazies"" than normal Hollywood fare. The extras on this DVD are first-rate. We're treated to a director's commentary, an interview with a period actress, trailers, and some clips from other period works.",1060905600,10,1885,5.181518151815181

949306,4,6304983786,"A biological warfare virus is spread out in Pensylvania after a plane crash and causes those it infects to accomplish irrational and dangerous actions; to counter this, political authorities dispatch a mostly anonymous military force, placing the state under the juridisdiction of people with arbitrary judgement. Romero mainly uses two separate but interdependent narrative trends: on the one hand, the efforts of five men and women to stay alive; on the other, those of the authorities - military, medical, political - to put an end to the nightmare (no matter how far from the truth they need to go). Much depth is added by the fact that most of the characters' words and actions run the risk of being filtered by the virus; the anonymous, masked `guards' are ordered to kill infected people, but having no clear, objective rule, they rely on their instincts and are thus liable to make serious mistakes. Who are `the crazies'? Those who are affected by something exterior to them (the virus), or those who are irrational `on purpose'? The virus is not dissimilar from the living dead of Romero's famous trilogy: it is of course dangerous, but it is also, like pain, useful in the sense that by nature it provokes a radical reevaluation which might not have happened without it. This is a strong film made with very limited means.",1035590400,2,1333,4.8766519823788546

That's almost lamer than saying your a Black Sabbath fan because you only like their most radio friendly tune, Paranoid! Mmmmkay? Someone really has too much time on their hands! ;P
Now being a REAL Romero fan, let me point out why this movie deserves some notice! Frankly, to my knowledge, it's the first of it's kind. Before The China Syndrome, before Outbreak, and predating even The Stand in it's novel format.... This is the first flick to really delve into a biological weapon gone awry type theme
I'll spare the plot-line... Other reviewers have already laid it out quite nicely! My two cents.... I found the Crazies to be great flick for the budget and time period! It looks dated because it's almost thirty years old! You'll be saying ""Holy 70's!"" from the first scene! It's low budget, and therefore as most low budgets go, no big name or top notch actors. But in typical Romero style for the 70's, he makes his budget look as though it was much higher and he get's probably the best that he can from his no name actors. If your looking for a gore-fest however? Wrong movie! No exquisite zombie gnawings here! There's blood! Just not over the wall Savini effects!
If you do fancy yourself a Romero fan for anything other than just his zombies? Namely the sense of having been properly disturbed by the time the final credits roll... Do give it a shot! I think you'll be pleased if you can appreciate what the man does with what he has to work with! If your a fan of biological accident flicks? I think you may be equally pleased to see where so many other flicks and novels in the genre obviously took their inspiration!
I'll close in saying that when I first discovered The Crazies, I was merely a fan of his zombie flicks... After viewing it I got something rather different than what I was expecting, but I consider the title to be one of the prime gems in my movie collection... Even after so many years!
And for a bit of trivia... Two of the actors in this flick would come back in his sequel dead flicks. I'll let y'all figure that out for fun!

With missteps like this, Monkey Shines, Creepshow 2, The Dark Half, and Martin I have had to rethink my position.
  The story is a good one on its base. A virus that was created by the government to be used as a wepon has leaked into the water supply of a small town and drives the residents there crazy. A great and creepy story, not to mention and good begining to the movie, is wasted by Ramero here. The movie is just silly at times and Ramero's directing is horrible. There are so many useless slow motion shots that you become distracted by them. The acting never rises above bad and the story slowly erodes until the only thing left is this. George A Ramero will alays be known for Night, Dawn, and to a lesser extent Day of the Dead and he should be. Those were good films that changed the way we watch movies but some of his films do not even come close to duplicating those movies.
