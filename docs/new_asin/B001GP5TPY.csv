3617840,4,B001GP5TPY,"I'm glad that they finally released Hi-5 as a season, but this DVD set appears to have been thrown together in a few hours. There's no episode list, and some menu options didn't work. You have to go through all 3 discs yourself to find out what's in it. On the other hand, my daughter LOVES Hi-5, and I can put in a disc, choose Play All, and not have to futz with it.  It also comes with some stickers which I'm sure my daughter will enjoy sticking in odd places all over the house.",1228348800,7,483,4.08421052631579
3617900,5,B001GP5TPY,"My grandkids love Hi-5 and since we can no longer get it on our cable network, I opted to purchase the Hi-5 Season one.  They absolutely love it!  It arrived in great shape.  I would recommend this seller.",1267228800,,205,4.342105263157895
3617901,5,B001GP5TPY,"This DVD is a family favorite at our house.  Our 3 year old is a huge Hi-5 fan and she loves this DVD. It includes songs from Robot Number One, Five Senses, So Many Animals and North South East and West.  It includes classic episodes such as Building  a Fence and Pizza, Pizza Pizza with Jen and Chats.  You will love this DVD!",1260230400,,327,4.142857142857143
3617902,5,B001GP5TPY,"My 5 year old niece Bethany introduced me to Hi 5.  I instantly loved them.  Now, as a proud dad, my daughter Janelle, at only 3 and a half months old stays mesmerized at the TV when Hi 5 is on.  Needless to say, I own the 3 seasons, the cd hits, the dvd hits and the spanish cd hits.  I highly recommend Hi 5.",1257552000,,310,3.723076923076923
3617903,4,B001GP5TPY,"This season 1 set contains 3 DVDs with a total of 20 full episodes. The only drawback is that they use the same song at the beginning and end of the episodes for several episodes in a row. So, even though the episodes are different, we find ourselves fastforwarding through the songs at the beginning and end so we don't have to hear the same song 10 times in a row. Other than that, it's a great set.",1252800000,4,401,4.153846153846154
3617904,5,B001GP5TPY,"My kids love it.
They used to love the sample they received from a nursery school few years ago. Now they are watching over and over again. I'm going to buy season 2 and more.",1246406400,,175,4.0285714285714285
3617905,5,B001GP5TPY,"The songs, motions, dances, people, and music on this DVD are superior.  My son isn't yet two, but he is singing and dancing right along with these ""animals"".",1244592000,,158,4.642857142857143
3617906,5,B001GP5TPY,I purchased this for my 2 year old daughter because she loves watching it.  My DVR ran out of memory so this was a great opportunity for her to watch them on video and add memory to it.  She loves it and has learned a lot from watching them.  Highly recommend them to your little ones!!,1243987200,,286,4.071428571428571
3617907,5,B001GP5TPY,"This is a favorite in our house.  I know that others have complained about the volume adjusting, but ours is just fine.  My little ones just love this DVD.  I like it because I don't have to put episodes on my DVR.  I can't wait for season 2 to come out on DVD, I'm sure that we will be adding it to our collection.",1242604800,,315,3.875
3617908,4,B001GP5TPY,"Well, according to the Curtis Cregan web site, there are 70 episodes of Hi-5 and it got the following 14 themes: Senses, Animals, Machines, Adventure, Games, Bodies, Wishes, Music, Colors, Making, Action, Teams, Wonderful, and Journeys.
So if it can be released in 3 sets (if the other ones came with 5 themes).",1232323200,,311,4.886792452830188
3617909,3,B001GP5TPY,"My little guy loves Hi-5 so he loves the DVD.  I hate to give them a 3 star, but the DVD quality is really bad.  The sound volume goes up and down throughout most of the songs, it's REALLY annoying.  We checked our sound system and it's working fine with all other DVD's. It's really bad in the main song at the beginning and end of the shows.  Since my son is only 14 months he doesn't notice it, but for the price we paid for the DVD I would have hoped for a better quality recording.  I agree with the other posts too, I think there are some episodes missing and the menu options are not that detailed.  I will probably have to return it, the sound going up and down constantly is horrible.",1230595200,3,693,4.0962962962962965
8306501,5,B001GP5TPY,I bought this for my godchild as a birthday gift. I received the product on time and I am sure my godchild will love it.,1437609600,,120,3.84
8306502,5,B001GP5TPY,Hi-5 is one of the best little kids TV show ever...my daughter loves to watch it and sing all the songs...sadly the show doesn't exist anymore but having it on DVD is simply great...,1417564800,,182,4.382352941176471

8306504,5,B001GP5TPY,"My little girl LOVES these guys! This disc plays all the way through so you don't have to mess with the DVD player every time a song ends. They are happy and fun songs. WARNING: these songs get stuck in my head and I find myself singing them in PUBLIC. They are very catchy, which is great for little girls, but embarassing for their mothers!",1386720000,,342,4.276923076923077
8306505,5,B001GP5TPY,my daughter loves this group. She has since outgrown it and we passed the dvd down to our little 3 yr old niece.. Awesome item!!,1364342400,,128,4.16
8306506,5,B001GP5TPY,This DVD is great for my 2 year old friend! He loves the songs and stories.  The colors are so vivid! The episodes are short enough for a little TV time and can be selected by Theme fairly easily once I figured out the menu selection process. Great to start while I'm making breakfast!,1318118400,,285,4.277777777777778
8306507,2,B001GP5TPY,"My daughter can't really talk yet but she shows more interest in the current Australian version.
But I personally think my 1.5yr old daughter prefers the two cuter Aussie guys than these two American boys.

8306508,5,B001GP5TPY,My daughter and I watch these shows at least once every week. She loves to sing and dance with the show. The picture quality is better that the TV shows.,1273968000,,153,4.133333333333334

8306510,5,B001GP5TPY,My son loves Hi-5 so much that we bought more of their season disc. When he watches them he is just so fascinated by their singing & great facial expressions. The songs are so well written for kids to understand. I like how they have real kids incorporated to the shows.  This is a great DVD to keep kids occuppied.,1269475200,,315,4.25
