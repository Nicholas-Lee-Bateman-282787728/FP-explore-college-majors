8029177,4,B0002M5U4M,"Mickey Rooney (born Joe Yule Jr.) has the longest career in Hollywood history-- 81 years of moviemaking, as of Jan. '08.  At age six Mickey played a midget in a 1926 non-talkie called ""Not To Be Trusted.""  From 1927 to '32, Rooney appeared in a continuous string of over 50 ""Mickey McGuire"" shorts, all of which were entitled ""Mickey's ......."" The series continued intermittently until 1936. In 1937, Rooney took on the part of Andy Hardy, a character he would portray 16 times, until Andy's return from WWII in 1946, and once more in 1958, when he had a son named Andy Jr. After over 300 screen and TV roles and still working at age 87, Mickey Rooney will appear in four movies in 2008.
