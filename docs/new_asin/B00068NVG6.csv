2175274,5,B00068NVG6,"What can one say about the opportunity to view the premiere performance of a Rodgers & Hammerstein musical starring Julie Andrews at the start of her illustrious career?  Impossible?  Not any more.  As the song states, ""Impossible things are happening every day!""

This is truly an historic disc.  Broadcast live in 1957 and until now never broadcast again or available to the public at large, this is a remarkable performance.  This is Cinderella as written by Rodgers & Hammerstein.  You can debate the merits of Julie Andrews' performance vs. Lesley Ann Warren's vs. Brandy's, but what is not debatable is that this version of the show is the one written by the masters themselves, not pieced together by a later production team.

And the production itself is truly enchanting, even in a sometimes blurry black and white.  It is a delight to hear the dialogue that was cut from later editions.  The song ""Impossible"" makes sense for the first time because it flows from a conversation between Cinderella and her godmother in which the godmother at first mocks Cinderella's ""impossible"" wishes, before revealing her true identity as a fairy godmother in the song.

For my money, Julie Andrews gives the definitive performance as Cinderella.  She is charming, spirited, and beautiful, and she clearly revels in this performance.  Of course, her voice is luminious, but her acting is simply breathtaking as well.  She perfectly expresses the hope and longing of a young girl trapped in dire circumstances without wallowing in self-pity and hopelessness.  And the wonder of her transformation is a joy to behold.

And the supporting cast is absolutely wonderful.  Alice Ghostley and Kaye Ballard are a scream as the stepsisters, and Howard Lindsay and Dorothy Stickney make a most lovable and comic King and Queen.  These parts were cut down to practically nothing in the 1965 version, a real shame now that the hilarious original dialogue can finally be seen and enjoyed.

Whichever version one prefers, this is the show as originally written, performed by the original cast, recorded live, making the viewing experience the closest thing anyone born after 1960 will ever have to seeing for themselves the premiere performance of a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.  Every fan of the musical theater should own this DVD.",1102377600,24,2319,5.084656084656085
2175275,3,B00068NVG6,"PBS is airing this version today, Dec. 4, 2004 afternoon. The songs are brilliant as ever, but, Julie Andrews - regardless of the fact a landmark 115 Million people tuned in to view the original 1957 T.V. broadcast - looks too old as ""Cinderella"" even in her youth and will NEVER top LESLEY ANN WARREN's sensitive, endearing, heartwarming and memorable defining performance in the 1964 remake. LESLEY(Cinderella) and STUART DAMON(as The Prince) will forever be instilled in the hearts and minds of millions of folks who were fortunate to see this during its yearly decade long run. That brilliant 1964 version is also available on Dvd - check it out - Lesley Ann Warren(17 at the time)will steal your heart. You'll laugh, you'll cry - you'll never forget Lesley Ann Warren. Julie Andrews was brilliant in many other films, most notably in ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC"", but, her ""Cinderella inetrpretation seems awkward and too calculated at best. Kaye Ballard is quite funny as one of the step sisters.",1102118400,10,994,4.9226190476190474
2175276,3,B00068NVG6,"I saw this version of Cinderella on a big screen a number of years ago at the Television Broadcast Museum in Manhattan. Although I love Julie Andrews, in this broadcast she seems too young and unsure of herself as an actress, even though she was a lovely singer. The script of this broadcast does not approach the cohesiveness or interest of the later 1964 broadcast of Cinderella with Lesley Ann Warren. That is the version people will recall most fondly over time. I think once this DVD is released most people will agree with me that it is kind of silly, the cast is not as interesting or attractive as the Lesley Ann Warren version. This Julie Andrews version will also be in black and white, a huge negative for today's younger fan.

If you want to enjoy the young Julie Andrews, buy Mary Poppins or The Sound of Music instead.",1101859200,10,832,4.509933774834437
2175277,5,B00068NVG6,I have had the fortune to see all three of the cinderella made for tv musicals. Non are so lite and wonderfully made as the the very first with the very young and superb soprano that was she at that time. And of course the supporting cast never rose to the heights as those in the origional. So happy to have this being available this christmas.

2175313,3,B00068NVG6,It was the first time the musical was ever performed.  I will have to agree with another person she may have been out of place.  I was never completely satisfied with the choice of Julie Andrews.  If I knew what it looked like I would have rented and not purchased.  It is in black and white which is typical of that time.,1450224000,,322,4.145161290322581
2175314,5,B00068NVG6,This is the best Cinderella musical ever made. You cannot beat an 18 year old Julia Andrews for the energy and voice in the story. The color stills are marvelous. It is too bad that no one has colorized it.,1449014400,3,206,4.175
2175315,5,B00068NVG6,"When, I viewed this television special, it was like going back in time, to the beginning of TV. This was the 1st production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella. Of course, Julie Andrews was awesome. In the 1950s, this was all star cast. Very high production values. The stage design and costumes really can't be appreciated in B&W, but there are color photos in the extras. Those photos show the beautiful costumes. There is also a ""Making of Cinderella"" that has interviews with the remaining stars that were alive in 2004. We really enjoyed this DVD. Definitely worth the money for nostalgia buffs.",1444435200,5,604,4.931372549019608

2175320,5,B00068NVG6,"Only for nostalgia lovers.  Created from a B&W tape, the quality is less than we've all become used to, but, since it was a live performance, all that is available. Good acting, good cast, enjoyable play.",1437696000,,204,4.666666666666667
2175321,4,B00068NVG6,"I love seeing Julie Andrews in anything and had not seen this 1957 version of Cinderella until I bought this movie. The prince, played by Jon Cypher, has a wonderful voice and played the part convincing and with vulnerability. The step sisters and step mother are hoot, specifically stepsister Portia played by the very funny Kaye Ballard. It is a live for television Broadway-style production.",1437350400,,394,5.076923076923077
2175322,5,B00068NVG6,"I saw this 'live' in 1957 and am so grateful I can also enjoy it now.  Julie Andrews clearly outshines any of her successors in the role.  Alice Ghostly and Kaye Ballard combine just the right amounts of malevolence and incompetence.  The King and Queen milk each line for comic effect without overplaying.  The list of perfect cast members goes on and on.

But the book by Hammerstein is also a treasure.  It has a sophisticated edge that was dumbed down by others (including Rogers himself) in all the subsequent TV versions.  (Note the hilarious choristers pining for the prince in ""The Prince is Having a Ball"" including the one slugging down one more drink.  You won't find that in the later G-rated successors.)

The Rogers & Hammerstein score is one of their best, up there with ""Carousel,"" ""King & I"" and ""South Pacific,"" albeit with less serious subject matter.

The production numbers are cleverly staged on a restricted set, more closely resembling Broadway than a limitless Hollywood sound stage.  Finally, it is 'live' TV--warts and all--including the famous slip up by the Prince in the reprise of ""Do I Love You Because Your Beautiful.""  You'll hear about that in the bonus comments generously provided.

All in all a fine example of how sheer talent can yield an inspired rendering of a classic fairy tale.",1437350400,,1322,4.822222222222222

This was live television, along with the little mistakes--most of which, when you saw them on T.V., only left you wondering if that is what they were.  You couldn't move back to check out what you thought you might have seen, so they were absorbed in the warp and weft, and forgotten.",1432512000,3,468,4.367816091954023

Yes I said the 2nd, for as much as I love Julie Andrews, eight years of improvements in Television and what I can only assume must have been a much more lavish budget make the 1965 production much more magical.  Also with apologies to Ms Andrews 19 year old Leslie Ann Warren's innocence was almost palpable.  Ms Warren of course had the advantage of a Color broadcast with extra scenes that enhanced the impression of a shy young maiden.  Fair is Fair Julie turned the tables in Victor Victoria with Leslie coming off the shrew *LOL*.  Treat yourself and see both this and the 1965 version..",1427155200,,827,4.591836734693878

It was a one-time 'live' event bradcast in color. The producers forgot to record it. Fortunately someone at the studio video taped it off a tv monitor and now we are able to enjoy (even though it's in Black & White) the best version of this play. Written especially for Julie Andrews also starring Jon Cypher (of Hill Street Blues fame).,1407283200,5,493,4.488888888888889
2175395,5,B00068NVG6,I enjoyed this DVD.  It was interesting to see the original Cinderella Musical with a young Julia Andrews but the Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren is still my favorite.  That because it in color and I know most of the actors.,1406678400,,234,4.5476190476190474

As many have said before, the picture is blurred on occasion and has black spots but that's part of watching a show this old. Julie Andrews is brilliant as well as the rest of the all-star cast. Just shows that musicals now a days need to use more Broadway performers than just star actors. Definitely a great buy if you're a TV fanatic or love the musicals of the 50's.",1400630400,,545,4.2

I heard the Mother and Daughter march on my parents Hi-Fi in the 1960's. I had no Idea what it was. But I knew it was a middle-of-the-road music station format staple playing on their radio in another room.  It is an ear worm. But one day about 2005 I had a flash of intuition: Richard Rodgers. That's his sound of music. By process of elimination on Amazon and ruling out the rest of Rodgers & Hammerstein...Cinderella. Deep down, black and gray are the colors of my former employer. But CBS would do well to electronically colorize this telecast. To see Kay Ballard at her comedic best, and hear Julie Andrews wonderful voice is why you want this.

2175429,3,B00068NVG6,"While I do appreciate the talent and effort that went into this production, I am disappointed in the DVD itself.  First, the picture is terribly grainy, with white threads and dots from the film.  In this day of digital restoration, it is a shame to sell a piece without cleaning it up a little.  The sound and music is equally full of hiss and pop, which greatly reduced how much I enjoyed the show.
I was also disappointed that the cover art is touched up and painted, but the film is black and white only.  This seems like false advertising, even though the description is clear that the show is black and white.
So if you are a film historian and you enjoy seeing shows in their untouched format, you will enjoy this DVD.  If you are like me, looking for an enjoyable night of singing, you may want to look elsewhere.  The poor quality of this DVD is inexcusable.",1388534400,,867,4.3875
2175430,5,B00068NVG6,"As you watch this gem from the history of television and the musical, do not ever forget that what you are watching was happening in real time on the evening of March 31, 1957. This was live TV, with complex set and costume changes, all done on an enlarged theater stage. Maintaining the awareness of this reality will make the viewing a magical experience and more than compensate for the recording quality, which is due to the fact that this is the actual filming of a television screen image. The book and songs were written for this event, seen by almost 40 million people at once. No subsequent version can match the immediacy of this performance. The extras on this DVD, interviews with Julie Andrews and others, add immeasurably to one's appreciation of the accomplishment.

Unfortunately, it only exists in a B&W kinescope, and that is what this DVD is taken from.  This is young Julie--around the same time that she was doing My Fair Lady on Broadway.  I was very excited to be able to see a lost treasure.  We noted several things:  1.  The later Leslie Ann Warren version mimics Julie almost exactly--kind of spooky.  2. The sound stage was small, and the cramped conditions are very noticeable.  It takes away from what could have been a beautiful show.  3.  Maybe Julie was tired from doing 8 shows a week on Broadway, but this isn't her finest performance.

As much as I'd like to have it, that's too much money for me to justify spending.  I purchsed this instead. It was wonderfully acted and sung. Julie Andrew and Jon Cypher have great chemistry.... in fact mildly sensual. The characters really come to life. Kaye Ballad and Alice Ghostley went beyond the one  the dimensional stepsisters of the 1965 version. They were interesting, quirky, and not unattractive. Ghostly is actually kind  of cute. The actors who played  the King and Queen, Godmother, and stepmother... all breathed life and interest into the roles they played. This was great ensemble acting and singing.  Truly enjoyable. In that regard, this is a better version, for sure.

While a solid 5 stars is deserved for acting, singing, and costumes, the production itself was lacking for me. I kept wishing  the props were better, it was lengthier, and the production was on a grander scale. To completely enjoy this version, it's probably necessary to appreciate this is a live production..really a broadway type play, and not a movie, even though we are viewing it on film, instead of in a theatre.  The cheaper props are in line with a live production.  They only serve to set the stage.

This version is black and white. I do think it should have been colorized and remastered. It would have presented so much better. The picture was decent, the sound was good, the costumes were great, and the cast was outstanding.

Jule Andrews wedding gown was marvelous.  Still photos and cast interviews are included on this DVD.  The DVD has an option to allow viewers to go directly to their favorite song.",1357430400,6,1739,4.814814814814815

2175505,5,B00068NVG6,"I saw the Lesley Ann Warren version when I was in second grade and the next day in the lunch line all of us little girls wished for dresses like Lesley Ann Warren's and to look just like her.

I still like it but I like this one too. This one is much more light-hearted and funny. I love Kay Ballard's stepsister---she's hopelessly clumsy and Jon Cypher does a good job of rolling his eyes at her sallies. Alice Ghostley is a woebegone stepsister (despite her character's name, Joy) when she isn't tormenting Julie Andrews, who is lighthearted and graceful as always.

Edith Adams's godmother is much more fun, kind of a celestial cheerleader, and who is sly enough to whisk Cinderella out of the house and slip up to the palace with her.

Everyone sings much better in this version; Lesley Ann Warren did a good job of portraying the pathos of her situation---when she sang ""In My Own Little Corner"" after the steps went to the ball and cried a little I cried with her when I watched it as a child and I still get a little misty---but Julie Andrews's Cinderella doesn't let herself get down. She doesn't seem surprised either when her godmother shows up to cheer her up after she's left alone. Then they happily plot to get her to the ball. It's all very smooth.

I also love the king and queen. They are very comical, but they also act convincingly like a husband and wife, for instance, in the first scene where we see them together she's mending his pants and he's dismayed when he puts them on and finds they're too small. Everyone's named, except for the godmother, and in the 1965 version no one has names.

This version is very much of its times; it's much more graceful and lighthearted, and everyone but the prince and Cinderella are a bit satirical, and all the old stage standbys were rolled out for this one, at a time when television was basically live stage-acting but broadcast. The 1965 version is a bit grimmer; Cinderella is aware that she's a slave in her own house, and she's aware that her stepmother and stepsisters really don't like her. You kind of get the idea that it's even a bit dangerous for her there and that the Prince really rescued her. In the 1957 version it's portrayed as just a big step up in the world.

Finally, I have to say that I like the cramped set---it kind of symbolizes a cramped world where everyone's jockeying for the attention of royalty. It's a small world here---Cinderella and her stepsisters live just down the street from the Prince and they've never seen each other before, though in the scene where they make the ball announcement, she's out with her stepmother and stepsisters, carrying their packages. In a stratified society, you wouldn't catch the Prince's attention unless you did go to a ball dressed up.",1341532800,,2770,4.563380281690141
2175506,5,B00068NVG6,"I had never seen this musical as it was only broadcast the year I was born. We did enjoy Julie Andrews on a recording of My Fair Lady and later in her movies. So, it is amazing to see this DVD of her early efforts so many years later. The studio was small, but the staging makes use of it all. The small screen is filled with singing, dancing, and musical drama. It is not as refined as the 1964 remake with Lesley Ann Warren, or the later Disney version with Brandy Norwood which did show on our childhood TVs. But it captures a bright moment in the 1950's when TV was still a new and blooming medium for family enjoyment.

There is no voice quite like Julie Andrews' and that is the ONLY thing that carries this production. I did read some of the other reviews that weren't very complimentary, but I didn't think something with Julie Andrews in it could be that bad.  I was wrong.

Although he looked a bit older than the role's intent of 21, he gazed at Cinderella (Julie Andrews) with such devotion during the dance scenes it really made you feel like he was in love. Just enchanting!

is R and H musical version and it is Leslie Ann Warren versus
Julie Andrews. I did not care much for the Andrews version. Julie
announced at the beginning that this was a one time only production
on t.v. She also mentioned doing My Fair Lady right around the same time.
R and H cast some well oiled stage stars in this show and that's part of the
problem. It's a little too oily for me. Andrews looks uncomfortable in her role.
The step sisters were funny, but they looked almost as old as the step mother. The
prince was awkward and stiff. During the dance at the ball, Andrews looked like
she was dancing with a mannequin. Edie Adams as the fairy godmother sang well,
but she also looked uncomfortable. The sets were sloppy, I thought. This is the
only time I've ever seen Cinderella wishing up her own idea for a pumpkin and white
mice make-over. It is also the only time I've seen Cinderella arrive at the ball at 11:30

2175520,5,B00068NVG6,"This DVD offers a black and white recording, filmed off a TV set, of the original 1957 television broadcast of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical 'Cinderella', starring a very young Julie Andrews. Given that the original tapes were lost, this is the only video material available from that legendary event in television and musical theatre history. The image and the sound are clear enough to allow for a pleasant watching experience. Until now, all I had from 'Cinderella' was an audio recording of the lovely Jon Cypher/Julie Andrews duet 'Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful'. To actually see them perform it on screen was totally captivating and a rare thrill. The musical itself is enjoyable, with fine performances all around and sufficient pace. The treatment of the Cinderella character is interesting: she is upbeat rather than dejected, and brings about the transformations that allow her to go to the ball by the sheer strength of her wishes, overcoming the reserves of her rather mischievous fairy godmother. 'In my own little corner' and 'Impossible' are two more fine songs. I watched 'Cinderella' with my 8 year old daughter, and she loved it.",1249084800,2,1162,5.057291666666667

That represents an astonishing 62% of the U.S. population at a time when there was no pay-per-view, no cable, no TiVo. Having just read Julie Andrews' remarkable early-life autobiography,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Home-A-Memoir-of-My-Early-Years/dp/0786865652/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Home: A Memoir of My Early Years</a>, I have to admit my interest was piqued to see this seminal production. Andrews was all of 21 on the night of March 31, 1957, when she performed the title role live, and it's fascinating to watch her screen persona so fully formed seven years before her big-screen debut in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mary-Poppins/dp/B0002VEPRQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mary Poppins</a>.

The evidence refutes Jack Warner's later claim that she was not photogenic enough to be in the film version, and the 2004 DVD is the closest many of us will get to see what her Eliza was like.

Captured in black-and-white kinescope, the show is definitely a product of the Golden Age of Television with its flickering images and claustrophobic, sometimes awkward staging. However, as directed by Ralph Nelson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Father-Goose/dp/B00005N910/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Father Goose</a>), the story's universal charm and farcical touches, the expert cast of mainly Broadway veterans, and the memorable musical score more than offset the technical deficiencies. Andrews' bell-like soprano is at its best in her sadly hopeful ballad, ""In My Own Little Corner"". As the King and Queen, playwright Howard Lindsay (he co-wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Life-with-Father/dp/B000067IVZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Life with Father</a>&nbsp;and the original book for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B00000AG6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>) and his real-life actress wife Dorothy Stickney prove to be a comically adroit pair. Fellow stage legend Ilka Chase plays the malevolent stepmother with catty aplomb, and the comic duo of Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley fulfill the comic possibilities as the jealous stepsisters. Edie Adams lends a more saucy twist to the ethereal role of the Fairy Godmother. Much later a reliable character actor best known as the Chief of Police on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hill-Street-Blues/dp/B000BOH8YG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hill Street Blues</a>, a stalwart Jon Cypher fits the cardboard dimensions of the gallant, smitten Prince and showcases a surprisingly robust tenor voice first in a soaring duet with Andrews on ""Ten Minutes Ago"" and then on the show's best song, ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?"".

Like most of my generation, I am more familiar with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1965-color-remake/dp/B00005RYKY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1965 color remake</a>&nbsp;(starring a very young, squeaky-voiced Lesley Ann Warren) since the original production aired only once. Running a fleet 77 minutes, it's a shame that the original color footage could not have been saved since the fairy tale atmosphere begs for it. Luckily, as part of the DVD, there is a gallery of color production and rehearsal stills to give you an idea of what the original audience may have seen if they owned a color TV set, a rarity at the time.

2175552,4,B00068NVG6,"Because I had read other reviewers comments about this version of Cinderella being far superior to the other versions, I decided to purchase my own copy of the DVD.  I didn't check to see if it was available to rent at one of the local video stores, because I know that it's only recently been restored for viewing after many years.  But I didn't mind spending a little money on this much praised movie, because with so many positive comments about it, I just figured I was investing in a small piece of American history.  Besides that, I just wanted to be able to make up my own mind about it compared to the other versions.

I've loved Julie Andrews in other movies such as ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"".  Don't get me wrong.  I'm not a Julie Andrews basher; I'm a fan.  But I consider this version of Cinderella a let down, especially after all of the praise about it.  I'm not sorry I purchased the movie; in fact, I'm proud to own it.  This is because after learning that it was shown one time on television, filmed before a live audience and viewed that one night by millions of people, I can have nothing but the utmost respect for Ms. Andrews and the entire cast.  I know that only the best of talent could do something of that magnitude.  But I beg to differ with the reviewer who commented that Julie Andrews is the only Cinderella.  Oh no she is NOT!  On the contrary, despite the fact that Andrews was only about 18 when she made this movie, she looked too old for that part.  Leslie Ann Warren (in the 1965 version) was far more vibrant, far younger looking and far prettier.  Quite simply, Warren just LOOKED more like Cinderella than Andrews did.  I'm a huge fan of black and white movies, but I feel the magic of ""Cinderella"" is lost when viewed this way.  Yes, Julie Andrews singing is superior to Leslie Ann Warren's, but this doesn't take away from the fact that Warren did a fine job singing as well.  In fact, I was pleasantly surprised because I didn't realize Warren could sing so well.  Jon Cypher also sang well and made a very engaging prince in the original movie, but he's no match for Stuart Damon.  Damon was some SERIOUS eye candy in the 1965 movie, had a beautiful voice, and as far as I'm concerned, is the ONLY prince for Cinderella!

I admit that the 1965 version had the benefit of being filmed in color, without a live audience and with newer technology.  Still, I found the 1957 version of Cinderella flat and boring.  I called myself saving the best for last, viewing Brandy's first, Warren's second and Julie's (the ultimate) last to finalize my Cinderella viewing pleasure.  The 1957 movie was not only a little difficult on the eyes (yes, I know it was done in kinescope picture and sound) but it also put me to sleep - in the daytime. The cast, singing and acting ability are no better in the original than they are in the other versions.  Also, contrary to some of the other reviewers opinions, the cast, singing and acting in the Brandy Norwood/Whitney Houston version of Cinderella is great too.  Obviously the Brandy/Whitney version won't go down in history the way the original did.  But it's a fun interpretation of the story and far more visually stimulating and beautiful than the original.  This is true of the 1965 movie as well.  All three versions of Cinderella boast a wealth of talented artists with acting and vocal ability who do great justice to the lovely music of Rogers and Hammerstein.

Overall, I really think all of the pomp and circumstance about the Julie Andrews version of Cinderella has more to do with nostalgia than anything else.  Most of the people who love it so much and think it's so superior probably just saw that version before any of the later ones.  I'm sure the evening of March 31, 1957 was a magical night for them and millions of others as they watched the story of Cinderella come to life on television along with the beautiful music of Rogers and Hammerstein.  But that's all it is people - pure nostalgia.  If you enjoy the story of Cinderella as much as myself, do yourself a favor and see all three versions with Julie Andrews, Leslie Ann Warren and Brandy Norwood - then make up your own mind.

I grew up watching the version with Leslie Ann Warren and had always hoped to find the same movie with the same songs and without Warren's grating voice. I was so glad to find Julie Andrews singing them in this version!

Again, the recording value is not great, but the roughness of it gives it a charm that I find many musicals lacking. Also, the prince in this one is much hotter. The scene where they meet in the ballroom seems much more natural and less ""fantasy-based"" than in other Cinderella films.

Give it a try and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",1196899200,,715,4.32089552238806

2175570,5,B00068NVG6,"Some benevolent  show business/entertainment godmother granted a big-time wish when this Original 1957 Version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""CINDERELLA"" was finally released on DVD. I purchased this multiple times to give as gifts at Christmas in  2004. I know people have very fond memories of the later 1964 videotaped remake starring Lesley Ann Warren. The fact that some people actually prefer the later remake to this  original absolutely boggles my mind!!!  It is now time for a serious reality/fairy tale/musical theatre check, people!!
  This original version will be best appreciated by those who love live theatre as opposed to tacky and tasteless, kitschy TV specials. Some people are put off by the fact that this original is in black and white. Well, the best live-action fairy tale film of all time,  Jean Cocteau's 1946  ""BEAUTY AND THE BEAST"" is in black and white. And this black and white ""CINDERELLA"" positively glows with a charm that is completely absent from the 1964 and 1997  (with pop music Princess Brandy Norwood and Ultra-Divas Whitney Houston and Bernadette Peters)  color TV remakes.
  Keep in mind that CBS TV  Network comissioned and Rodgers and Hammerstein wrote this musical especially for Julie Andrews, who was a mere 22 years old at the time. And here is Julie Andrews,  amazingly poised, polished, and professional as the beloved fairy tale herione. Julie Andrews exudes star quality. Poor Lesley Ann comes across as a  semi-talented amateur, desperately trying to prove that she is up to the challenge. By 1964, Hammerstein's superb libretto had been replaced by a vastly inferior script by Joseph Schrank, so Lesley Ann didn't get much help. The  embarassingly amateurish, tacky, tasteless script, costumes, overall production, don't do Lesley Ann any favors.
  The best roles in this  original  1957 production belong to  comediannes Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostly as Stepsters Portia and Joy. Ballard, in particular, almost steals the show from Andrews. Edie Adams makes a surprisingly practical Godmother. She doesn't so much grant Cinderella's wish. Rather, she facilitates Cinderella's strong inner drive and desires. Theatre vetreans Howard Lindsey and Dorothy Stickney portray the King and Queen as parents who are deeply concerned for the happiness of their son Prince Christopher. Jon Cypher, virtually unknown at the time, appears understandably nervous and occasionally flustered in his debut role as Prince Christopher. Remember, this ""CINDERELLA"" was done as a LIVE theatre musical seen by an estimated audience of 107 million people. Cypher is certainly handsome, sings beautifully, and appears properly enchanted by Andrews. Cypher does stumble on the staircase while chasing her at midnight, but this gives the scene reality.
 In the ""Making Of"" featurette, Cypher laments jumping ahead of the orchestra in his reprise of ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?"",  and cutting Stickney off, but that's live theatre for you. In the ""Making Of"" featurette, Cypher, Andrews, Adams, and Ballard all recall the insanity of live television  (Adams admits she thought the show would be ""the biggest train wreck in the history of show business"") and all speak of their admiration for Howard Lindsey and Dorothy Stickney, and Rodgers and Hammerstein. Photo galleries reveal scenes in color and even promotional ""JULIE ANDREWS PAPER DOLLS!""
  The segment of Rodgers & Hammerstein on ""The Ed Sullivan Show""  one week prior to the show reveals the cracks in their partnership. The two men are standing next to each other and obviiouly are still miles apart. But ""CINDERELLA""
remains their last great score. Hammerstein died two years later, nine months after the Broadway premiere of ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC.""
  Rodgers and Hammerstein's score is the best one ""CINDERELLA"" ever had. With songs like ""My Own Little Corner,"" ""Impossible/Possible"", ""Ten Minutes Ago"", ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful?"", ""Stepsisters' Lament"" and ""A Lovely Night"", who, of any age, isn't enraptured?
  It is absolutely amazing that the entire show was performed LIVE. It certainly is not a self-contained production. Scenes occur in the town square,  various locations in town, Cinderella's house (interior),  Cinderella's garden, (exterior),
the Palace Dressing Rooms, Ball Room, and Gardens. The production also employs several large staircases the cast has to dance on and run up and down-- and let's not forget the ""magical"" transformations  that are so integral to the story. The fact that this production does it all in a brisk 77 minutes  (minus the commercials)  makes you believe that impossible things  actually are happening every day!
  Most importantly, Hammerstein's original libretto (subsequently adapted and used for countless stage presentations) is the classiest treatment the fairy tale ever received. Cinderella is not portrayed here as a miss who sits weeping by the fire waiting for someone to rescue/help her (Lesley Ann's later Cinderella reverts to that helpless behavior). As played by  Julie Andrews, she is an active participant in shaping her own destiny. By the time her godmother appears, she is already on the road to self-actualization. Her godmother wisely warns that the danger in believing in fairies and guardian angels is you get into  the habit of depending on them too much. Cinderella herself tells her godmother exactly how to transform the pumpkin, mice, rats, etc.  Outside the Palace, the godmother tells her, ""How your wish turns out is up to you!"" Later, perhaps taking this as a cue, Cinderella leaves her house and hides in the Palace Gardens, waiting for her glass slipper fitting. Cinderella is arrested for plotting to ""capture the Prince."" The Godmother suggest that before she is thrown in jail, the guard try the glass slipper on Cinderella as a joke-- all clever variations and turns to the familiar tale.
  Because the central theme in this ""CINDERELLA"" is self-actualization, I often watch this when I'm depressed.
It always uplifts me!
 An interesting side note of trivia:  :Julie Andrews. of course, achieved movie superstardom just a few years later as Maria in the  1965 film version of Rodgers And Hammerstein's ""THE SOUND OF MUSIC."" Lesley Ann Warren auditioned for the role of Liesl, that went to Charmian Carr. Years later, Julie Andrews and Lesley Ann Warren appeared together in the 1982 film comedy ""VICTOR-VICTORIA""; for which both ""Former Cinderellas"" received Academy Award nominations.",1185840000,6,6487,5.2900390625

2175601,5,B00068NVG6,"Once thought lost to the public forever, a black and white kinescope version - the only surviving element other than the cast recording - of the 1957 live color TV production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella can now be enjoyed by all. A charming production starring some of the biggest legends of the stage and the one and only Julie Andrews, R&H's 1957 TV production of Cinderella is truly delightful.

The DVD gives this historic TV production the royal treatment. The bonus features may not be large in quantity, but they definitely give insight into the making of this one-time-only TV show, with new interviews with four of the stars of the show, including Julie Andrews, Rodgers and Hammerstein's appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, photo galleries, and a new DVD intro by Julie.

The centerpiece, however, is the production itself. Although I didn't really notice any major digital artifacting, the transfer suffers greatly because of the age and properties of the source material. Scratches and grain are present throughout. Unfortunately, this is the best we will ever see of this show unless the videotape that the DVD insert mentions surfaces, and we're very lucky to have this. However, behind the scratches and grain and general murkiness of the images lies a real treasure that shines through any imperfections in this element.

I truly recommend this DVD to anyone who is a fan of the other two TV productions of Cinderella, fans of Julie Andrews, fans of R&H's work, fans of classic TV, and fans of musicals.

2175604,5,B00068NVG6,"Back in the golden age of television, when TV specials were just that, waiting for the broadcast of a show like ""Cinderella"" was truly an anticipated event. Add the names of Rodgers and Hammerstein and Star-in-the-making Julie Andrews, and you have an entertainment milestone! This was the celebrated songwriters only musical especially written for television, and it is a classic. The project was specifically intended to showcase Andrews (then appearing on Broadway in ""My Fair Lady""). The hand-picked cast included Ilka Chase as the stepmother, Edie (here billed as Edith) Adams as the fairy godmother, and Broadway Stars Howard Lindsay and his wife, Dorothy Stickney as the king and queen. A newcomer, John Cypher, later to gain fame on ''Hill Street Blues'' was cast as the prince, and up and coming comedians Alice Ghostley and Kaye Ballard played the stepsisters. Because this was before the advent of videotape, the production was kine scoped while being broadcast live, although the original color kine scope was lost. Julie Andrews may look somewhat matronly (even at 21) to be Cinderella, but her lovely voice and star quality carry her through Fans of ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound Of Music"" will be pleasantly surprised to see how vulnerable she can be. Cypher is a suitable prince, with a good voice, while Adams is pushing a bit too hard as the godmother. Ilka chase, as the stepmother, and Ghostley and Ballard as the stepsisters are more silly than wicked. In all fairness though, this version was written more as a modern take off on the fairy tale, while the 1965 remake returned to the mood of the traditional story. The sets and costumes are rather cut-rate, somewhere between medieval and '50s modern, but they get by. Andrews is really the reason to see this, and it did attract a record audience at the time. The DVD is a treat with a remastered black-and white picture which, while not perfect, is good enough. There are several nice extras, including a documentary with Andrews, Cypher, Adams and Ballard reminiscing about the making of the production. Either for historic or entertainment reasons, ""Cinderella"" is well worth having. It's not every day you can watch a star being born. [phillindholm]",1134777600,5,2226,5.002695417789758

2175606,5,B00068NVG6,"After an absence of 47 years, the ORIGINAL TV production of R&H's CINDERELLA is finally available to the masses. I must say I am indeed impressed with this DVD. Here we have the show the way 120 million people in North America saw it on the evening of Sunday, March 31, 1957.

However, I must dissent and say that the 1964 version with Lesley Ann Warren is much easier to take than this. That is not to say that this version is not wonderfully produced, which it is. The original was performed on live television, probably in an attempt to give TV viewers a sense of the intimacy of a live stage performance in a Broadway theatre, and was preserved only in fuzzy black and white kinescope form (the original live broadcast was in color). Contrary to what some believe, this kinescope was not from a dress rehearsal, but was made from the actual live performance.  By the time the remake was put into production several years later, videotape had been perfected, thereby allowing the remake to be videotaped for posterity. As well, the 1964 remake was able to take advantage of CBS's all new state of the art television studios, which allowed them to really open the whole thing up. To sum up, this DVD is more for historical importance than for viewing pleasure.

Don't get me wrong. Performance-wise, the original is the best. The cast is original, handpicked by the masters themselves, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. And the performances are genuine. It all still deserves five stars. Its only downfall is that it has to be rendered in primitive 1957 kinescope picture and sound technology. The producers of this release must be commended for putting together a very praiseworthy DVD--they did the best they could with the source materials at their disposal. The 1964 remake, originally aired regularly on TV and available on VHS (and now DVD) for years, is doubtlessly the more familiar version. My preference would probably be for that version, as it is the one I grew up with.",1126828800,10,1989,4.759420289855073
2175607,4,B00068NVG6,"This live-action Cinderella truly belongs to Julie Andrews.  It's not that the other actors are bad in it, it's just that she shines above the others, and is on camera nearly every minute.  Her Cinderella is shy and charming.  She has a firm grasp on reality, but continues to dream ""impossible things""--never something so preposterous as marrying the Prince, but perhaps a pumpkin becoming a carriage is doable?  As always, Andrews' singing is excellent, in a ver accessible Rodgers & Hammerstein score.

The King and Queen, played by real-life couple Howard Lindsay and Dorothy Strickley, are fleshed out considerably in this version.  We see them bicker as they plan the ball, but we also see them in love, and wanting only the best for their son.

Edie Adams gives up a light Fairy Godmother, who although she maintains it's impossible to grant Cinderella's wish, ultimately comes through.  Unlike other versions, she appears again later in the story to continue setting things in the right direction.

The stepsisters aren't so much ugly and wicked as misguided and pitiful.  They're plain ordinary girls who simply haven't got a shot compared to their stepsister, the glamorous, if sooty, Cinderella.  They don't come across as mean, just unfortunate--a definite accomplishment on the part of the actresses.  The Prince, played by unknown John Cypher, rounds out the main cast; the character is the standard Prince, but as with the King and Queen, we learn more about him in this version.

The score, as with any R&H musical, is its own character, and a dazzling one at that.  With songs like ""In My Own Little Corner"", ""Impossible"", ""A Lovely Night"", and the enchanting ""Do I Love You Because You're Beautiful"", this one can't be beat.  Get ready to buy the soundtrack for this version as well as the DVD.

The video transfer for this, unfortunately, is Kinescope--made from filming a television screen during the broadcast.  Although the original was in sharp color, this one is sadly blurred black-and-white.  Take heart, though--the picture is still easily distinguishable; it just appears somewhat blurred.  Close-ups are still great, but some detail is lost in long shots.

The extras for the DVD are a mixed bag.  There are several picture galleries, mostly from a few scenes of the film.  The highlight is the interview with several cast members.  There are interesting tidbits on the process of filming this live production--a scary thought!

Bottom Line:  Although the picture is somewhat marred, this Cinderella is definitely one to take home.  The score, the actors, and the character development combine to make it one of the best tellings of the classic fairy tale.",1125964800,16,2685,5.045454545454546
2175608,5,B00068NVG6,"This is a charming version of the legend, characterized by a skilfull mix of the romantic and the comic.  Played by a young Julie Andrews, this Cinderella is busy, unresentful, and possessed of a rich imagination, which helps compensate for the pleasures she is missing in life.  What is particularly pleasing about this version is the balance between magic and, if I may so call it, a type of realism.  For instance, as it is announced that ""the Prince is giving a ball,"" we see the ladies of the kingdom getting ready, but some of them have the common sense to realize that while they may not be getting the prince, they may well catch some other man.  Cinderella's godmother, played with astonishing self-assurance by Edith Adams, seems an ordinary woman, and yet turns out to have extraordinary power.  Even while she is planning to help her protegee, she is pretending that it is ""impossible"" for a simple pumpkin to turn into a golden carriage and ""for a simple country bumpkin and a prince to join in marriage.""  These realistic and self-reflexive observations which the script makes about the fairy tale genre are overturned, to our delight, since ""impossible things are happening every day.""

Another thoroughly enjoyable aspect of this movie is the fact that Cinderella's ugly wicked sisters are really not all that ugly,and not all that wicked.  They're plain, spoiled, egotistical, and yet extremely likeable, played with great talent by two wonderful comic actresses.  Portia, played by a very talented Kaye Ballard, actually takes the viewer's heart.  Thus the two stepsisters are really just two plain girls whose hopes of catching a man at the ball are dashed.

The film is strewn with wonderful, catchy, and lovely songs,with great lyrics, such as ""In my own little corner,"" ""Impossible,"" ""Do I love you because you're beautiful,"" ""Ten Minutes Ago,"" ""Stepsisters' Lament,"" ""When You're Driving through the Moonlight.""

The DVD extras, including interviews with some of the actors, are very interesting.  I should mention that both the picture and the sound of the film really show their age.  This may bother some viewers, and I must admit that it bothered me to some extent upon a first viewing.  But leaving that aside, this is a version well worth having, made very enjoyable by a talented cast.",1123372800,5,2315,4.961139896373057

And why shouldn't it? This is the production the way it was meant to be seen; too often it's staged with the libretti and it doesn't make sense.

2175623,5,B00068NVG6,"Last night I was feeling sort of down in the dumps and remembered we had this movie out from Netflix.  What could be better than the combination of Julie Andrews and Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella?

It was EXACTLY what I needed!

Julie Andrews - young, sweet, her acting-as-she-sings better  than any of the others (and I am a fan of EACH version of this musical, just so you know!) Her rendition of ""In My Own Little Corner"" and the incredible love song, ""Do I Love You Because Your Beautiful"" were phenomenal.

I had to adjust to her funky hair style - at first it was minimally distracting - and my daughter's complaints that this was in Black and White - but the music and the acting and Julie Andrews!! My childhood hero as little more than a child herself!

I also adored the Step Sisters (played by then-young actresses Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley - who knew?!) and the Fairy Godmother was tremendous - loved her sparkly eyes and her spinning Godmother Baton - she was surprisingly youthful and pure, too, as compared to Celeste Holmes and Whitney Houston in the later versions.

The bonus material was exceptional, also - wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.

It truly made for ""A Lovely Night"" (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)",1108944000,14,1235,4.738317757009346
2175624,5,B00068NVG6,"I vaguely remembered seeing this version when I was five years old on a black-and-white set, so seeing it in this black-and-white kinescope version did not cause me any major trauma; it was not that different than how it was for me years ago except that now I have the advantage of more than forty years of experience and knowledge. There is absolutely no comparison between this version and the versions that came after it. In this version, the acting and plot are much more substantial, and Julie Andrews as a singer and actress dwarfs those women who played in the title role after her. The 1965 version had the advantage of color and more video effects but was all glitz and rather shallow. The Disneyized, multiracial version that was created later failed to take into consideration the need for acting ability on the part of the singers in the leading roles. The original version far surpasses both in terms of overall content and performance. Had the same technology been available for the original version as was available in the versions that followed it, there would be no contest at all.

I recall that when the 1965 version came out, the justification for making it was that when the 1957 version was produced, videotape did not exist so that once the production was aired, it was lost forever. Had the producers tried to recreate the 1957 version rather than to mangle it, perhaps they could have been forgiven, but Lesley Ann Warren could not easily have replaced Julie Andrews, as this DVD shows very clearly.

This version is truly Broadway brought to the small screen. In addition to Julie Andrews as Cinderella, Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostley are the two stepsisters, Ilka Chase plays the stepmother, and the original version gives a much clearer picture of how Cinderella is excluded from the family structure than in the other versions while the talents of the actresses truly shine through. Edie Adams plays a very smart and savvy Godmother (the term Fairy Godmother is not used in the show at all) and is quite sly in how she ""turns in"" Cinderella to the palace guards so as to trick them into trying the glass slipper on her at the end. Her baton-twirling ""magic"" introduces the Waltz for a Ball, a true Rodgers and Hammerstein dance specialty number that is the hallmark of many of their great musicals. Howard Lindsay and Dorothy Stickney, both Broadway theater royalty, play the King and Queen and have very significant roles in the play in a way that was totally lost in the versions that followed; the scenes with the King and Queen are entertaining and endearing. The young Jon Cypher was a total unknown at the time of the production and gives an impressive performance; he had the best debut any novice actor could have dreamed of having. The magic of live theater is very evident throughout the show in a way that the later versions totally lack. Even without the comparison, this production of Cinderella is superb entertainment.

The additional commentaries that come with the DVD are most interesting and revealing as well. For those persons who remember the initial screening of Cinderella, watching this performance is a powerful experience. For those seeing it for the first time, it is a valuable milestone in the history of television and musical theater that has fortunately been captured for future viewing.",1106784000,15,3350,4.832752613240418
2175625,5,B00068NVG6,"What a gift it is to now have the two versions of this wonderful musical reflecting the differing personalities and outlooks of its creators.  Hammerstein was the dominant force in the 1957 production, giving Julie Andrews' Cinderella the outgoing, tolerant, and optimistic elements of himself, which added a sparkle to his dialogue (and Rodgers' music).  Following Hammerstein's passing, Rodgers was to give Leslie Ann Warren's Cinderella a good dose of his pessimism and introversion, while deleting and adding musical numbers to set his tone more persuasively.

Both casts are wonderful.  There are so many virtues in each cast and production, the differences and minor faults do not matter.

Although colorization usually annoys me, and I would not want to be without the original black and white kinescope as presented here (since it was a black and white experience for most viewers), the fact is that the production was designed for color television and, as can be seen in photographs included with the additional material on the DVD, the true colors used in the actual production can be determined.  I would much prefer that sort of restoration than to watch the version with Brandy.",1106092800,10,1191,5.1450777202072535
2175626,5,B00068NVG6,"At last, the original version of Rogers and Hammerstein's Cinderella is available.  Originally aired only once on live television in 1957, this classic has, until now, been lost to history.  I grew up on the 1965 version (Lesley Ann Warren) but have always wanted to see the Julie Andrews version ever since I learned of it.

For those familiar with the 1965 version, there are some surprises here.  There were apparently many changes between the two.  The original opens up right with ""The Prince is Giving a Ball"".  There is no scene were Cinderella meets the Prince prior to the ball.  At home the Stepmother and Stepsisters (Portia and Joy) do a much better job of belittling Cinderella and making her do all of the work.

The Godmother (no mention of fairy) is far more mischievous in the original.  Even her involvement in the story's conclusion is quite different not only from the 1965 version, but from most tellings of the fairy tale.  We see a little more of the King and Queen and even have a musical number about preparing the Ball.  There are even quite a few scenes that, at least when compared to later versions, could be considered somewhat risque.

For fans of the 1965 version, you should watch this one as well.  It is sufficiently different to be just as entertaining.  First timers to the Rogers and Hammerstein story will be entranced by this fun tale.  Watch it by all means.",1106092800,103,1399,4.653061224489796
2175627,5,B00068NVG6,"This release of the original telecast of RODGERS AND HAMMERSTEIN'S CINDERELLA has been well worth the wait!  After being one of the most-requested home video titles, at last we can add this historic programme to our collections.

In 1957 Rodgers and Hammerstein penned their own musical version of Charles Perrault's fairytale 'Cinderella', to be performed live on television.  Julie Andrews (who was starring on Broadway in MY FAIR LADY at the time) was selected to play the title waif.  The score and script were largely tailored to her unique talents.

The supporting cast included Broadway 'royal couple' Dorothy Stickney and Howard Lindsay as the King and Queen, with Ilka Chase as the Stepmother.  Alice Ghostley and Kaye Ballard played Stepsisters Portia and Joy.  Jon Cypher played the Prince with Edie Adams a glamorous and witty Fairy Godmother.

The script by Hammerstein is tight and clever (easily better than Joseph Schrank's for the 1965 television remake). The book is sharp and witty, full of hilarious scenes for the Stepsisters and the King and Queen.  Julie Andrews is far more defiant and heartbreaking in the role of Cinderella than Lesley Ann Warren (and let's not mention Brandy).

As much as I adore the Lesley Ann Warren version, I like this version much more.  The only reason why the 1965 version has got it's reputation is because the original was out of circulation.  Now we can all make up our minds which version is the superior, though the conclusion is obvious!

This DVD includes some great extras with a documentary featuring new interviews with Julie Andrews, Edie Adams, Kaye Ballard and Jon Cypher, as well as an optional filmed introduction by Andrews.  There are also some image galleries and the Rodgers and Hammerstein appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show.

Impossible things are happening every day, and they must be for this original version of CINDERELLA to finally be released on DVD!",1105920000,13,1929,5.022012578616352
2175628,5,B00068NVG6,"Imagine, if you would, that buried in some forgotten basement someone managed to unearth a filmed record of the first production of ""Oklahoma!"" ""South Pacific"" or ""The King and I.""  It would be pretty amazing, wouldn't it?

Well, the DVD release of the original production of Rogers and Hammerstein's ""Cinderella"" is no less a miracle than what I have described above.  It's pointless to compare or defend the 1957 original cast to the 1965 remake or complain about the limitations of a Kinescope recording.  This is ground zero for this charming work and warts and all theatre buffs should rejoice that it's finally available as something other than a nasty, 15th generation VHS copy bought illegally off the Internet.

I was six years old when I saw the original telecast.  The advance publicity lasted for weeks and anyone who could get near a television watched it.  In these days of disposable entertainment it's hard to communicate what an event something like this was.

Originally conceived as a vehicle for Julie Andrews while she was making ""My Fair Lady"" a hit on Broadway, she is ""practically perfect in every way"" in the title role.  This original screenplay is also superior to the chopped up version created in the 60's with Leslie Ann Warren.  There are great scenes with the Prince's parents, and there is a good feeling of family love that is conveyed.  The ending is also more touching and satisfying, since it is more generous to Cinderella's step family, and conveys a moral of understanding and forgiveness demonstrated by the kind hearted Cinderella.  Finally, it is a true treat to see and hear Julie Andrews sing and act the title role.  I highly recommend this DVD to any lover of the American theater and/or Julie Andrews.",1104278400,9,844,4.8671328671328675

I never really thought Leslie Ann Warren was that superb as Cinderella as a child and now after seeing the 1957 version it is makes me laugh until my sides ache when I hear how horribly Leslie Ann Warren sang and how bad Stuart Damon really was.  The rest of the story just plods along as well.  Everyone MUST buy this version.  It is fast paced and the prince and Cinderella's voices are to die for.

2175634,5,B00068NVG6,"The legendary Rodgers and Hammerstein are at their sublime best in this 1957 version of the fairy tale classic ""Cinderella"".  Richard Rodgers' melodies are beautiful and infectious.  His music gracefully captures the medieval flavor of this tale of a mistreated stepdaughter who becomes a princess.  Oscar Hammerstein II's memorable lyrics are alternately witty, romantic, and poignant.  They perfectly suit the characters' moods and help advance the story.

Some background on the brilliant Rodgers and Hammerstein:  From the early 1900's up until the 1940's most musicals had been a series of revues.  But in the 1940's beginning with Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Oklahoma"", the musical changed forever.  Rodgers and Hammerstein redefined the musical so that plot and characterization became elemental to its creation.

Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals always told a complete story.  And their score was essential to the plot and characterizations in the story.  Rodgers' music and Hammersteins's lyrics were seemlessly integrated into their productions so that their scores seemed to flow organically from the narrative.

Before Rodgers and Hammerstein, most musicals were a hodgepodge of unrelated production and gag numbers.  Also, the quality of the music and lyrics in those early musicals was frequently pedestrian.  The score was written to accomodate a star, usually a Burlesque-type comedian, or a chorus of leggy showgirls.

But Rodgers and Hammerstein elevated and transformed the musical by structuring it as a play and by tackling subjects as diverse as a Cinderella fairy tale, domestic violence, or racial bigotry among other topics in their musical plays.  And unlike the score in most musical revues, the melodies which Richard Rodgers composed were intricate and sophisticated and were indigenous to the plot and characterizations.  Hammerstein's intelligent, poetic lyrics eloquently advanced and enhanced the story.  There were no throwaway novelty numbers as there were in revues.

Because of the talent and innovativeness of Rodgers and Hammerstein, the musical matured and became a distinctly American art form.

And returning to the 1957 version of ""Cinderella"", Rodgers and Hammerstein chose a perfect cast for their endeavor.  A young Julie Andrews plays the lead and her voice is simply angelic.  (Has any actress ever had a more extraordinary voice than Julie's?)  The rest of the cast includes such familiar and beloved actors as Edie Adams, Kay Ballard, and Alice Ghostly.  They are delicious in their roles.

Although watching this rather crudely photographed 1957 black and white version of ""Cinderella"" takes some getting used to (I actually prefer the 1965 color version), it is still a masterpiece because of the incomparable score by Rodgers and Hammerstein and because of its endearing cast.  Don't miss this!",1103155200,9,2846,5.515011547344111
2175635,5,B00068NVG6,"I grew up with the 1965 broadcast of this show but alwasy dreamed of somehow seeing the original as the sountrack for it is far superior to the 1965 version.  Afer having seen it on PBS I knew I had to have it and believe that, although the '65 version is still lovely, the 1st telling of this tale is by far the best.  They took the meat out of the story when they remade it.  The ""Impossible"" sequence is much more believable in '57 than in '65.  With the exception of timing problems on one song I couldn't believe how smooth the whole show was.",1103068800,9,548,4.1415094339622645
2175636,5,B00068NVG6,"I love that one reviewer says JA looks too old to be Cinderella in this version..I believe she is 18 in this production. What Julie has that Leslie Ann Warren and Brandy couldn't come close to is a simple sophistication and a charming sense of self that only enhances her role as Cinderella. She also has a far superior voice to either of the other versions Cinderellas.

I do not like the 1965 version but I do think the Brandy version is cute but not as good as the original cast. But for me the Julie Andrews version, the woman that this show was written for will always be the best Cinderella for this particular Cinderella musical. The supporting cast in this production is also steller and much better than the 1965 version.

Don't let that fact that it is in black and white keep you from seeing this show. Some of the best movies of all time are in black and white.",1102982400,81,873,4.3496932515337425
2175637,4,B00068NVG6,"I just saw it on Maryland Public Television and it was a real event for me. I know both of the remakes, the Disney cartoon (which I never warmed up to), the version with Leslie Caron, the other one with Drew Barrymore, even the Prokofiev ballet. But I'm a vintage T.V. junkie at heart, and more than anything else, this production was a phenomenal achievement (and advancement) of stellar television. Differing from the TV staging of the Broadway musical PETER PAN- and as Julie Andrews herself mentions in the introduction (which I hope is included in this new DVD)- this production was originally written for television by Rodgers & Hammerstein themselves. And it is the slightly quirky, tongue-in-cheek script which is one of the show's delights. The biggest delight by far, is the fact that this was a LIVE performance, with all its warts showing- like a boom mike shadow floating over a curtain wall or a missed song cue in the second act. And this broadcast occurred roughly six months before the first mainstream videotape. No CGI or ILM movie effects here. Once you fully understand that, you can suspend yourself completely into a more innocent and wondrous frame of mind and let the performances and especially the music speak for themselves. A cleaned up, remastered kinescope film, you'll notice the unusually high contrast in some of the darker images and nighttime sequences. But the ""Impossible"" Act 1 finale with Andrews and gorgeous fairy godmother Edie Adams is still a stellar moment, from the sparkler lighting effects to the final shot inside the coach. I loved it!!

2175638,5,B00068NVG6,"I own a VHS copy of the 1965 version with Lesley Ann Warren, having seen it as a child and recall being mesmerized by the whole story, characters, sets, and ""feel"" of it. The majestic music was in no small part the reason for my finding it so memorable. After hearing about the 1957 version with Julie Andrews, I watched the PBS broadcast on December 4, and despite its being in black and white, I found it enchanting. There were some differences in the two versions: I thought Edie Adams made a wonderfully ""kooky"", earthy Godmother, whilst Celeste Holm's portrayal was more graceful and ethereal. The two stepsisters were more interesting and believable in the 1957 program, and the first king and queen were so charming and lovable compared to the one-dimensional monarchs-portrayed by Walter Pidgeon and Ginger Rogers-in Lesley Anne's. Julie Andrews was Cinderella-luminous, and so utterly magical. I now must own this original version as well, as each one offers its own unique twists on a classic and enduring fairy tale.",1102464000,17,1027,4.942196531791907
2175639,5,B00068NVG6,"It is amazing that some people seem to prefer Lesley Ann Warren's performance over Julie Andrews. There is absolutely no comparison. This Cinderella was written for Julie and she is magnificent in every way. No one has the voice or the charm that she injects into this character. Her version of ""In My Own Little Corner"" is enchanting, but also has a sadness that is absolutely right. Miss Warren is too worldly and gives the impression that she could easily be a ""West Side Story"" gang member rather than Cinderella. She simply does not have the ravishingly beautiful voice that Julie has. She is marvelous in many roles - just compare her performance in ""Victor/Victoria"" which shows the ""real"" Lesley Ann. (But even in that film Julie Andrews outshines her!)

This version of ""Cinderella"" is the best version with the comic numbers and fantastic supporting cast absent from others. Edie Adams is a scene stealer as the Godmother. The king and Queen have much more to do and have a delightful comic song that was cut from subsequent productions. No one can top Kaye Ballard and Alice Ghostly as the step sisters - comic gems!

What is also amazing about this production is that it was telecast LIVE and was not a film or tape as were other ""Cinderella"" productions. Today everything is recorded with none of the spontaneity that comes only from a live show.

Even though the only remaining record of this telecast is in black and white (and at the time of the original broadcast most viewers only had black and white sets), it is a must have record of the TRUE version of the work.",1102377600,139,1583,4.666666666666667
