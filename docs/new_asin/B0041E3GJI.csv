Don't forget; that's when the US was still killing its own wildlife for enjoyment, so criticism of the Brits is verging on hypocrisy. For me, the strength of the film is in its almost lyrical scenes of Tarka's life before his death. I agree that it's more like a wildlife documentary than anything else, but that doesn't detract from its overall beauty. Peter Ustinov's narration is faithful to the book, so it's 'warts and all'.

Maybe there should be a warning that some scenes might upset children. I could accept that; what I wouldn't want to see is a bowdlerised version of the book. It's not quite 'Nature red in tooth and claw'; how could it be, without cruelty to the otters? Anyone used to true-life documentaries on wildlife won't be upset; there's no blood and guts on display.

Unless you think that films about wild animals should still follow the Walt Disney style, this is a fine film about the life and death of an otter. Yes, the ending's sad but so are the endings of many other animals' lives. It's 40 years or more since I first read the book but I still don't want Tarka to die. He does, and that's the end of a great story. Perhaps after watching the film, you should read the book; as so often happens, it's better than the film.",1370908800,4,1375,4.4523809523809526
4241625,4,B0041E3GJI,"I can only echo what the other reviewers have stated. This movie is mis-billed as a family film. It must be thought of as a nature documentary like what you'd see on PBS or Wild Kingdom, where they follow the animals through good and bad and all consequences. With that in mind, just do as the other reviewers have suggested and stop the DVD before the last chase scenes. As the other reviewers said, early in the movie it's bad enough kids see Tarka and his family playing in one scene and then see all his brothers and sisters and parents getting blown away and hanging dead from a rack in the next scene. Who knew otters had such a tough life? And that those British were so uncivilized. I guess it depends on where the otter lives. I've never heard of otters being declared a nuisance and hunted like foxes and coyotes. That's just what those Brits do in this movie, which is focused around a British river where wildlife live. They hear there is AN otter, one single otter, in the river so a large group of armed Brits and a large pack of dogs go sport hunting. No wonder the Europeans have wiped out almost all trace of wildlife on their continent. No wolves, almost nothing larger than a rabbit, lives anywhere in continental Europe and Britain except for a small patch of forest in the Balkans. This movie clearly shows why. The picture quality and sound are superb, though full screen. Probably filmed that way, but it is a good clean transfer. So, if you like otters or nature documentaries in general, this is one worth watching though it is tragic in the end after a lot of happy scenes and music like you're mistakenly watching a children's movie.",1332720000,3,1660,4.481848184818482

8412618,4,B0041E3GJI,"We would have LOVED it, but there were too many predator/prey (the otters were the prey of course) situations for my kids to handle. Beautiful scenery and a cute story, but we didn't watch it all as it was stressful for my kids.",1427328000,2,228,4.325581395348837
8412619,5,B0041E3GJI,"One of my favorite animal movies..Tarka had it tough from the beginning- Dad got killed, later Mom was trapped and was hanging from a trapper's line dripping with blood...maybe this is a PG-13 movie for kids for that one part but, overall a nice family movie that teaches youth about resourcefullness, tenacity, and to live life to the fullest while we are here on this great planet. It may sound strange, but Tarka inspires me with a will and a fight no matter how grim the odds....I was crying at the end of this good movie.",1387497600,,526,4.489583333333333
