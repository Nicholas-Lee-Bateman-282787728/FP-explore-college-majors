8657643,3,B00KCNBCF2,"The House of Mirrors has really bad acting (like excruciatingly bad!) and the storyline is really hard to follow (MUCH harder than I ever could've guessed!)  It's about a shady music executive named Andy who receives a phone call one night from a killer dressed in a goth look who says he's going to make him suffer.  If Andy does what the killer says he might just get out of this thing alive.  Andy doesn't understand what he means or who he is.  The killer constantly reminds Andy of events that happened the night before.  Apparently Andy was too drunk to remember what he did.  Or because Andy has mental issues and often sees a psychiatrist, maybe he's too warped to think clearly.  We get our answer later!

The way this story develops is oddly disjointed.  We see Andy knock on the front door of a big angry-looking man and what appears to be his girlfriend.  The man is happy Andy is here to hand him $100 grand but Andy has no idea what he means.  It's assumed -at least by me- that the goth killer directed/forced Andy to this man's home demanding he hand money over to him, and that this angry looking dude is working for the killer.  Like the killer is forcing Andy to pay the people he screwed over.  But... no.  That's not what's happening here.

Soon after Andy meets up with a woman who's happy he's going to give the hospital where she works half a million dollars.  Andy's confused.  He didn't agree to this!  Wait, so is this woman working for the killer too?  SPOILERS!  No she's not, but it seems like it based on this scene.  Andy doesn't understand what she means, and frankly neither do I!  Turns out this woman is Andy's psychiatrist.  He goes to her sessions and she pretty much determines that he's a shady man who screws promising musician's out of their money.  She doesn't say that exactly, but Andy reads between the lines.  A lowlife!

When we see the psychiatrist woman being killed, the movie does an okay job teasing who the killer is since all we see is someone approaching and stabbing her.  It looks really cheesy and horrible, but at least there's a little mystery who the killer is.  That big angry looking dude is actually Andy's bodyguard.  He needs one for all the people he ticked off.  Given the bodyguard's angry look and the way he always appears to be on the verge of overpowering Andy to take the money he's owed, I was anticipating the bodyguard to turn on Andy but it never happens.

The storyline becomes a big mess (but an interesting mess!) near the end during a 15-minute scene when the killer breaks into Andy's ""home"" and confronts him.  The killer says this home Andy's been living in was never actually his home.  He says to Andy he knows he loves the killer.  The killer provided clues and wonders if anything is coming back to Andy's memory.  He says all this was Andy's idea but Andy doesn't know what he means.  The killer says ""Two worlds, and you managed to live in both of them!""  A split personality?  Maybe that explains Andy's mental disorders.  The whole time this conversation is going on the killer acts feminine and tame with really bad acting.

Anyway the killer screams ""Have you found the door!""  ""You're more intelligent than I thought but you're not as sick as me!""  The killer says he tried therapy too and that it's sad we won't see the psychiatrist again.  So... the killer killed the psychiatrist?  Not quite!  We see a dead clown in the bathroom with money sitting on top of him.  Andy lifts the mask and sees... himself.  So there's two Andy's!  But wait!  Turns out Andy had a twin brother named Max who was put up for adoption, and Andy killed him.  The killer saw Andy take the brother's life.  The killer had a deal with Andy that they were going to split the money.  Andy took his brother's identity because he didn't have one.  What the... how does this relate to anything we saw up to this point?  It does, read on!

Andy mentions how his parents took in the twin brother while giving him up for adoption.  His brother had the sweet life.  Andy should've gotten half of the inherited money.  Andy finds his brother one day many years later.  Andy approaches Max by waiting for him outside his office.  Andy tries to convince Max that he's his brother, but Max doesn't care.  Max says he's not giving Andy any money so Andy kills him.  Andy says he never tried to screw the killer though.  The killer sympathizes that it's hard to imagine what a brother feels after losing his twin.

So basically all this time Andy was pretending to be his brother Max and that's how he screwed people (mainly musicians) out of money.  The killer figured this out!  A turn of events is that Andy killed the psychiatrist because she was starting to figure out who he really is (or isn't).  The killer mentions that the psychiatrist might've been in on the million dollar deal, which just adds more to the confusion.  Andy mentions the killer will go down too, and that it's not his fault his record sales were low (since the killer was a musician).  The killer wanted Max's money too because he was jealous of his success.

""You wanted a record deal and I wanted my brother dead"".  That's a nice way of summing up the ending but... it's not done yet.  Turns out Andy and the killer had a deal in place.  They covered each other's tracks.  All Andy had to do was keep up his new identity.  This explains the clown body in the other room.  It's dead Max.  So much confusion!  But to be honest, it's a great segment.

Anyway the killer confronts the bodyguard and mentions the bodyguard's brother which is confusing to me because the movie's almost over and yet the bodyguard's brother is brought up.  The bodyguard ultimately shoots the killer after telling the killer that he'll shoot him and just tell the cops it was self-defense for breaking and entering.  Andy puts on his brother's clown mask. The bodyguard kills Andy when it's obvious Andy's even more of a lowlife than we realized.  He's not just a greedy music executive who screws people out of money- he's a killer who was jealous of his twin brother's fortunes.  The bodyguard somehow put all these extremely complicated pieces together and realized Andy's true self.  It's cheesy and poorly written the way Andy hides in his brother's clown mask in the corner behind the doorway while the bodyguard is *right* next to him on the other side knelt down and waiting to Andy to come around so he can shoot.

Okay with this BIG portion of the story in place, the movie overall becomes a little better.  It was a tremendously written segment I admit.  But this complex story-heavy segment was the only thing I liked about the movie.  Everything else was really lame.  I'll be nice and give the movie 3 stars, but my rating is only that high based on one 15-minute segment.  The movie's called House of Mirrors perhaps because the mirrors are a metaphor for twists and turns!",1498435200,,6904,4.518218623481781
8657644,5,B00KCNBCF2,This was one of the coolest indie horror movies I've ever seen.  There was especially a very amazing scene involving a knife wielding man in a bloody tuxedo wearing a clown mask.  Worth it.,1409011200,,189,4.529411764705882
