8276978,4,B001AD54L6,"The Indian Scarf features a plot that has been done many times before; a wealthy person dies and leaves a will which incentivizes the potential heirs to kill each other to obtain a larger fraction of the estate. Although the plot is familiar, I think that this movie was well done, with decent character development, lots of red herrings, and a mystery that keeps you watching until the end. As an American, the only negative mark I give this movie is for the comedic scenes, which consist of mildly amusing European humor that isn't really that funny. However I give this movie four stars overall because I enjoy these dark house mysteries and found it entertaining.",1412208000,,667,4.758620689655173
8276979,3,B001AD54L6,"A typical B movie from the era. It combines a little cheezy comedy with mystery and horror. It's an OK film, but not great. The ""Case of the Frightened Lady"" is a better done version with English speaking actors. This movie was originally filmed in German and has been dubbed in English. Obviously, I've nothing against German language or culture. It's just that movies dubbed before the digital era are generally not all that well done. However, it's an OK film to kill an hour and a half with if you're a fan of the genre like me.",1351987200,,532,4.438775510204081
