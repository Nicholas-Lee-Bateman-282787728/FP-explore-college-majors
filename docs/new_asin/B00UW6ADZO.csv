8708595,5,B00UW6ADZO,"I have been waiting for a DVD set with Edenbreidge for a long time and I am extremly pleased with this set.  The only thing that could have made it better would be to have companion live audio CD's with the DVD's.  As for this DVD set being PAL, it is Region free and plays beautifully on my LG Blue-ray.  I want to thank the previous reviewer, Aria Araya, for thier great review and all the reviews I have read from this person in the past.  I have included many of Aria's favorites on my list of favorites as well.  Back to this DVD set, it's wonderful.  If you love Edenbridge as much as I do, the price for the DVD set is worth it.  Great product, Thanks Edenbridge!!",1437091200,,671,4.155038759689923
8708596,5,B00UW6ADZO,"This is an awesome DVD set about the history of Edenbridge...from Lanvall's
""Cascade"" beginnings to Edenbridges' latest album ""The Bonding"". I pre-ordered mine through Edenbridges' site back in February and received it in May 7th signed by the band themselves, along with an Edenbridge postcard also signed by the band. There is too much to list what is on here, but you get 6 DVDs full of interviews, concerts, videos, making of videos, documentaries, etc. 9hrs of pure Edenbridge entertainment! Each disc is in chronological order: Disc 1 (1994-2002) Disc 2 (2002-2004) Disc 3 (2004-2005) Disc 4 (2007) Disc 5 (2006-2008) Disc 6 (2010-2014). Excellent clear picture in widescreen with a good 2.0 surround sound. The digital transfers of old concert footages and archives have been done very well. All interviews and documentaries are subtitled which is great. This is a PAL format DVD so a multi-region player is needed for NTSC regions. So you've got the scoop, now get your copy and enjoy 9hrs of pure Sabine bliss!!!",1431043200,5,1021,5.047337278106509
