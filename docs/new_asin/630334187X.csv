8405510,3,630334187X,"Unfortunately, this video has so many popping noises that it sounds like a string of firecrackers. They are so excessive it leads me to question whether they really are the result of poor audio mixing or if they have  been faked. I prefer a crackling fire, not something that sounds like the  fourth of july.",941846400,5,308,4.581818181818182
8405511,4,630334187X,"A dramatic display of fiery destruction, removed from the unwanted effects of soot by the magic of video. It doesn't matter which way your flue swings when you're watching ""Hearth."" Several conflagrations roll by  with scenes occasionally repeated. The effect is satisfactory for  background color or full frontal viewing. A little too much pop in the  audio could be improved with a better microphone in the sequel.  ""Hearth"" proves that heat, fuel and air working as an ensemble  put on a flashier show than each acting alone. The performance is uniform  as logs and sticks all make ashes of themselves. ""Hearth"" does  raise the troubling issue of whether a video representation can satisfy the  urges of those who may have an unhealthy fascination with the topic or  whether it just fans the flames. Another issue is self-destruction.  ""Hearth"" can be viewed alone, but best in the company of others  making jokes about dumb blondes attempting to roast marshmallows on the  screen. Watching in rewind doubles the fun.",939772800,5,1020,5.041916167664671
