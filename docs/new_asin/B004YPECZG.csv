8448709,5,B004YPECZG,"This is a small and perfect portrayal of real life in modern Australia, out in the countryside in a rented house.  A woman, working as a nurse, has been abandoned by her husband and left with the three daughters to raise.  Money is very tight and creditors are literally banging on the door.  The girls are adept at hiding from these guys!  (Assume battle stations!)

The oldest girl is Lou, 11 almost 12, budding gloriously, moody and intelligent.  She does not like the situation of a deteriorating family because she is stuck, as the oldest, to be the babysitter while Mum's at work on the long summer days.

Suddenly, here comes her father's father, Grandfather Doyle, in severe depression and with Alzheimer's, moving in to the house!  Lou is forced out of her room and becomes babysitter to yet one more.  The health services pay them to watch their Granddad, so they need the money and accept him.

It is soon clear that he thinks Lou is his long ago runaway wife, and he falls in love with Lou, whom he calls ""Annie"".  Lou fights back in denial but slowly sees the wisdom of going along with him.  They even plan ""to get married"" just to make him happy as he lives in a dream of the past.

Then the tensions begin and the plot thickens, as obvious dangers rise up in such a situation.  That's what keeps you watching - to know what will happen next.  Sure enough, something bad does happen.

What I liked was the absolute everyday realism of the house, the girls, the mother in her weariness (at 27 she has a daughter 11?), and John Hurt as the ""man who lost his marbles"" (and he knows it in some lucid moments!)

My own father was a merchant marine, a navigator, for 13 years.  When he got Alzheimer's, we kept him at home here in San Francisco, and we all began to live on a ship.  Everyday we had to check which dock we were on and report to Dad.  He was not the Captain - that was Mom, and he told us she was a toughie, ""Watch out for that Captain!""  He would think that I, dropping in after work, was a dockworker, snuck on to his ship to get a free meal.  He would sneak me into the kitchen if the coast was clear, i.e. if the Captain wasn't around.  He would encourage me to get out of that deadend dock work, the whole industry was about to change and I would be out of a job.  I should go into the radio work or the boiler room, he advised, and then get work on land.

It was the first time that we ""kids"" (five of us from 45 to 55) got a glimpse of our Dad in his pre-married state, and heard so much talk about going around the world.  He was really fed up with it in real life, and never even bothered to get off the ship when it came into harbor after a while.  It could be dangerous for the Merchant Marines in Third World Ports; they were targets.

So watching this film really hit home for me.  You can see how Alzheimer's patients need extreme love and patience; that is what they hear and respond to more than anything else.

Good acting in all the roles.  Love that Aussie accent, too!!!!",1396051200,2,3015,4.218531468531468
8448710,4,B004YPECZG,"This is the second independent film from Monarch that I've seen and reviewed in as many weeks and, while it didn't hold my interest as well as ""Lebanon, PA"" (seed review elsewhere), it was well worth spending the 86 minutes with. (There are no supplemental features.)

This is a ""small"" film - the kind that grab audience awards at regional film festivals. It covers many of the ""topics"" that frequent independent films: loneliness, financial problems, mental health (Alzheimer's, in this case), and family ties. It was filmed in South Australia and funded in part by the Australia Film Commission.

The family here is the young 24-year old mother Rhia (played by Emily Barclay) and here three daughters, the oldest - the title character Lou - is now 11 years old and on the verge of being a teenager. The father left a while ago and the family is struggling to stay one step ahead of the credit collectors. As the film begins they learn that Rhia's dad (played very low key by the best-known actor in the cast - John Hurt) - who has Alzheimer's Disease - is being released from the medical facility and needs a place to stay. He moves in with the family (he has some money and can contribute to the household) and slowly comes out of his depression. He begins to ""bond"" with the young Lou and she with him. But each has their own fantasy as to what the other can provide and it is  at this point that the viewer senses that something ""not quite right"" is about to happen. Lou is growing into a woman (even at  age 11 you can see it in her eyes and figure) and the grandfather (Doyle is Hurt's character's name) still had memories of his late wife Annie. So there is a bit of Nabakov's ""Lolita"" entering the plot. I'll leave the result and the rest of the story for you to experience for yourself.

The cast is small - only eight members (the others being a boy who befriends Lou and the social worker who brings Doyle to his daughter.)

If you like small independent films - you won't go wrong here. And you'll remember Lou's face (actress Lily Bell-Tindley in her screen debut) long after the credits roll.
