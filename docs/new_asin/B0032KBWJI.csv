8387531,5,B0032KBWJI,"This instructional DVD takes you through the basics, from proper finger picking technique all the way up to working up to more complicated songs. I was impressed by the wide selection of songs and the fact that each song could be first learned, was then played through at a slower pace, then reviewed at full speed.

The disk navigation is simple to manage and Evan is a strong communicator and instructor. I'd pick up other instructional videos of his based on this disk. Definitely recommend for people just getting started, and maybe as a review for intermediate players as well.",1376438400,3,582,4.82
