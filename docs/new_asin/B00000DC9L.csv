7905864,4,B00000DC9L,"In  1957, with  the U.S. release of  Roger Vadim's ""And God Created Woman,""  Brigitte Bardot  became an  instant  international  sensation.  ""Her Bridal  Night"" (aka ""The Bride Is Much Too Beautiful"")  was  made a year earlier  and  one  can see why she became  France's  most  famous sex  symbol.  The film  is  delightful,  the  actors are  appealing and  Bardot's  charms  are  on  ample  display.  An  enjoyable  little comedy.",1393200000,,431,5.03030303030303
7905865,3,B00000DC9L,"Charming romantic comedy nonsense with Brigitte Bardot, HER BRIDAL NIGHT (aka ""The Bride is Much Too Beautiful"", La marie est trop belle) is really only a footnote in her screen career, but it's delightful none-the-less.

Pert teen model ""Chou-Chou"" (Bardot) is secretly in love with fashion magazine editor Michel (Louis Jourdan), though must tread very carefully, as she suspects co-worker Judith (Micheline Presle) of also harbouring feelings for him.  During a weekend photo shoot in the country, reality and fantasy blur when ""Chou-Chou""'s male model partner walks off on the job, and Michel must replace him for a series of wedding photos.  ""Chou-Chou"" goes overboard trying to keep her feelings under wraps as the situation dissolves into farce.

Pierre Gaspard-Huit directed this froth in the same year that Roger Vadim immortalised Bardot as the ultimate screen vixen in ""...And God Created Woman"".  It's a thin piece of French pastry, and thankfully doesn't overstay it's welcome.  The English dubbed version (which is, I believe, the only version of the film currently available on home video) is quite well-done with Louis Jourdan, at least, reprising his role.

The DVD from Laserlight/Delta Entertainment also includes a special introduction from Tony Curtis, plus the trailer for the 1965 Bardot/Jeanne Moreau film ""Viva Maria!"".",1291334400,,1344,5.401913875598086
7905866,3,B00000DC9L,"Bardot is as aggressively irresponsible as she is shamelessly female... Vadim knew how to exploit her charms... He made her a living, breathing sexual fantasy, an object of desire, a symbol of sexual liberty, and as he puts it: ""The unrealizable dream of all married men.""

However, filmmaker Pierre Gaspard-Huit did not understand that Bardot's image had been permanently altered, and cast her the same year of ""And God Created Woman,"" in rather dull film, in which Bardot played an adorably naive and provincial girl metamorphosed into a cover girl on the lookout for her Prince Charming...

The hottest most provocative new bombshell had been woefully miscast as a blushing, sweet little thing, which was really ""too much.""

Luckily, 1957 began with ""Une Parisienne,"" which saw Michel Boisrond, her friend and ally since the film ""Cette Sacre Gamine"" assign her role of a dynamic and fun-loving woman...",1233878400,2,906,5.149659863945578
7905867,2,B00000DC9L,"Mostly narrated and in Black and White. I was expecting a ""highly commical"" video. It took me 3 days to get through the movie. I had to keep turning it off out of boredom.",998697600,,171,4.0588235294117645
