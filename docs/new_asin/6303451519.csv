646480,5,6303451519,"This is one that is easily forgotten, but people should rediscover this piece of work. 2 men's lives unexpectedly cross when a diner is robbed. Donald(Williams) Quinelle decides that society is too sick to ""survive"" and joins a survivalist group in the mountains. Sonny(Matthau) Paluso wants no part of the survivalist mode of living, but in order to save his own life from the armed robber they can both put the finger on he soons joins Quinelle in the survivalist camp. Jerry Reed is the robber and does one heck of a job here. Opening credits use the late Governor Huey Long's ""Every Man a King"".",1013126400,5,599,4.660377358490566

646482,5,6303451519,In my view this is one that gets better and funnier the more times you watch it. Pay attention to each and every thing Williams says and does and you'll see what I mean.  Matthau is also hilarious.  Watch for the scene when he applies for unemployment benefits. I don't ever get tired of this one.  Get it before it becomes unavailable.,983923200,,336,4.387096774193548
646483,4,6303451519,The Survivors brings together Robin Williams and Walter Matheau in a story of hope and adventure with many laughs sprinkled within. Their wonderful chemistry along with a suprisingly great job by Jerry Reed make this movie  a perfect getaway.,914284800,,242,5.205128205128205

646903,5,6303451519,"Sadly all three lead actors are gone. And I don't think any of them really realized what a classic they had made. Easily one of the funniest and most quotable movies ever. The banter among the three (Matthau, Williams, and Reed) is outstanding. I know it was a bomb in the theaters when it came out in 1983. And kind of got lost over the years to the dustbin of failed comedies. But maybe the one good thing with Mr. Williams passing is for a new generation of film lovers to discover it and enjoy it and quote it. I suppose only two small gripes. One, Williams' girlfriend. I don't know what she's doing here. Seemed really superfluous, maybe only there to prove that he was straight, or not so goofy. And two, the ending. A little too sappy and incongruous to the rest of the picture. I mean when you start a film with a guy getting fired by a talking parrot, you don't want it to become too treacly at the end. Just my opinion. Otherwise top notch!",1447891200,,951,4.288888888888889

647009,5,6303451519,"I think this is one of Robin Williams best and funniest movies ever.  A couple of strangers having a very rough day get robbed.  This causes Robin to become crazed with safety and survival.  The other guy, Walter, just wants to forget it.  Robin however will not let that happen and causes the robber to come after them both.  Robin joins a survivor military group preparing for the end of the U.S.  He is about to get married and Walter's is having daughter and job troubles as the ""killer"" decides to get them.  All sorts of craziness everywhere.  The whole family can watch and enjoy this movie.  No ""adult stuff"".  GREAT movie.",1441324800,,631,4.553571428571429

647118,5,6303451519,Robin Williams is very funny in this comedy with Walter Matthau. Robin had the opportunity to work with a lot of famous actors in his time. In the beginning of the movie it reminded me of the Birds when Robin Williams went to a filling station and filled his tank the wrong way and Matthau dropped his lit cigarette which burned down his filling station. In the Birds a man was pumping his gas from a distance and dropped his cigarette and had blowin himself and the station in flames.,1426809600,,485,4.4

647693,3,6303451519,"In THE SURVIVORS, Robin Williams and Walter Matthau team up to take on a professional hitman, at least at first. This film actually makes fun of survivalists which, while relying heavily on stereotypes, is still quite funny. The story, though, is predicated on a series of coincidences which makes the whole thing seem set up to make a point. And while things never get preachy, there are a few moments that might have you rolling your eyes a bit, but then it returns to the laughs. Even though this is one of Robin Williams' lesser comedies, he and Walter Matthau make a fine comic team who play nicely off of the other. There isn't too much in the way of character building, but I didn't honestly expect too much of that in this type of movie. The pacing is pretty good, keeping things moving along at a nice clip, until the final act which was a bit bloated. It isn't until the final moments that a switch-a-roo of sorts is made in terms of who the villain is, and calculated to drive home the message of the film, that is, survivalists are all crazy, deluded gun nuts. While this might be true to an extent, this still doesn't excuse reframing the hitman as just another victim of an economy in the toilet (to borrow a phrase from the film). This just seemed odd to me, and somewhat misguided. Still, the farcical nature of the film makes it hard to take seriously, but in the end I quite enjoyed it. Great? No, but it's a decent watch.",1410048000,2,1440,4.417293233082707

647820,4,6303451519,"I've been a big fan of this film ever since I came across it in my local video store - remember those ! - back in 1990.
3 strangers lives come together - Robin Williams, Walter Matthau and Jerry Reed - when it seems they all lose their income on the same day. All 3 can be seen together in the employment office - this is one of those movies where there's alot happening in the background so you need to pay attention - after which Reed decides to go and rob the nearest diner where Williams and Matthau just happen to be. All of this leads to a short-lived love affair between Williams and firearms, which then leads to him leaving behind civilisation's 'the big cespool' and heading off into the snowy mountains to live with a bunch of other survivalists.
This isn't a perfect film by any means but the ending contains what is probably the most moving piece of acting that Robin Williams ever gave and is now all-the-more poignant following Williams' sad death.
Having realised that his survival stint has been a complete waste of time and knowing he's lost the woman who truly loved him because of it, Williams in despair removes nearly all of his clothes out in the snowy wilderness - if this film was made today this scene would be filmed in front of a green screen in a central heated Hollywood studio ! -  then turns to Matthau and in a truly universal moment of 1 human being looking to another for solace, asks him what he's going to do now and for Mathau to tell him that everything is going to be alright.
Robin Williams has never been so heartbreakingly genuine and honest in this moment; it moved me when I first saw it 24 years ago and it's all the more powerful now, knowing how the great man himself sadly took his own life.
Where else can you find a movie where Williams accidently destroys Matthau's livelihood without a moments notice, where you can spot an early appearence by John Goodman, where Williams asks the immortal line, ""what kind of man gives cigarettes to trees ?"", and what now contains 1 of the most moving endings ever put on film ?

No...I'm not some anti-gun nut and have enough of my own, but this really shows how things can get out of control quickly when you lose common sense and perspective.

648272,3,6303451519,"OK, I love Robin Williams. I even have a real fondness for Walter Matthau. But this movie is not up to the standards of either one of them. It's more silly than funny, if you know what I mean. The premise is pretty dumb, the co-incidences are implausible, and some things which are clearly not co-incidences are not explained.

It was a very bad day. Donald Quinelle (Robin Williams) was fired from his executive level job by a parrot taught to recite ""you're fired"" by his boss, who is ""out of town."" The boss's secretary assures Donald on no uncertain terms that the firing is serious as she hands him his final paycheck.

Sonny Paluso (Walter Matthau) is also having a very bad day. He's on the phone about something that sounds bad for the company when Donald comes in to fill up his car, and because he is so distracted, puts the nozzle in the wrong spot and the gas spills out onto the ground. All over. Quite a considerable puddle.

When Sonny comes out to blow off steam about the phone call, he tosses his cigarette butt to the ground. Three guesses what happens next.

So both these hard luck guys are in a cheap diner having coffee when a hooded robber bursts in and tries to rob the place. In a hysterical scene which makes it pretty clear his ghetto black accent is phony, Sonny manages to pull off his hood. Not only is he white, but Sonny recognizes him. (First unexplained item.) In the scuffle, Donald is shot in the shoulder.

Well, there's a great deal more to it than that, but eventually Sonny is driving Donald home when they pass buy a gun store. Donald says he just wants ten minutes to look, but an obsession takes hold of him. He ends up buying a whole lot of weapons (""No, it's a semi-automatic. An automatic would be illegal.""), and frightening the heck out of his fiance. He has also signed up for a survivalist training camp in Vermont for a two-week session.

Sonny thinks he's crazy, but accepts the address where he will be, even though there's no phone service. So when the killer gets out on bail and comes after Sonny, he and his 15-year-old daughter head for Vermont and Donald's ""survival cabin.""

If I tell you any more, I may ruin it for you. There are plenty of laughs, and even a serious point to be made here and there, but as I say, it's not up to standards for either Williams or Matthau.

He is a single father of a young daughter who's protective of her and scared of everything else. Williams and Matthau decide to sign up for a soldier of fortune type camp where they  want to learn survival skills for self protection. However they have two big problems, Jerry Reed, the bad guy, is onto them and follows them to the camp. The camp's instructor turns out to be a ninja type maniac with the mentality of get them before they get us at any cost. I'd classify this movie as a comedy-thriller with an edge. It will keep you laughing and you can't go wrong with Williams and Matthau.",1280620800,13,1005,4.374331550802139
648390,2,6303451519,"I like Robin Williams in his later work, especially dramatic roles, but in this movie he was clearly coked up. No one can be that hyper without ""a little help from his friends,"" and Robin Williams himself admitted in a Reader's Digest interview that he was a cocaine addict earlier in his career. I didn't like the scenes where he was so hyper. The beginning of the movie was actually okay and got my interest until the part where Robin Williams showed up at Matthau's house late at night and they both confronted the hitman and then drove him to the police station. The movie quickly went downhill from there.

Walter Matthau and Robin Williams are excellent actors, but the story had no good plot, as one other reviewer pointed out. Why are they suddenly friends with this hitman? Why is the daughter watching a porno movie when her dad (Matthau) walks in and then leaves it on like it's no big deal? No American teenager would do this (and I was 17 at the time this movie was made, so nothing has changed culturally). The whole movie was just very bizarre.

I actually prefer Robin Williams in non-comedic roles. He is an excellent dramatic actor! His comedy is not for me.

I give it two stars because the story was interesting up until the scene of driving the hitman to the police station, and also because I like Walter Matthau a lot.",1279238400,2,1341,4.510288065843621

648551,2,6303451519,"As I watched The Survivors, I couldn't help but wonder what was going through the mind of director Michael Ritchie when he was presented with the script.  Outside of the enormous gaps in plot and development, he had to see some humor in it somewhere to cast two direct opposites of the comedy spectrum to helm this project.  There had to be a mission or a reason in Ritchie's mind when he decided that Robin Williams, a fast-talking comedian that can sometimes be uncontrollable, and Walter Matthau, a slow-methodical comedian that appeals to the ""every man"", would be his key players.  I wish I could have been a fly on the wall during this opening meeting because this little fly would have spoken up and mentioned that this pairing would doom the script, and possibly put a black mark on both of these actor's careers.  I wouldn't just stop there, I would tear this film to pieces trying to get others to explain to me the subsequent ending and missing tone.  The only element that I would be content with would be the casting of Jerry Reed, who honestly brought some humor and intelligence to this scarred film.  The Survivors was not a film, but instead an attempt to allow two comedians the opportunity to express themselves coupled with heavy firepower.  Nothing more, nothing less.

 Could somebody, anybody, please help me out with the story surrounding The Survivors?  From the zigzag opening centered around the parrot and Robin Williams' job to the incident at Matthau's gas station (a plot point never mentioned or concluded), Ritchie spends no time developing anything.  His choice of direction is simply allow Williams to be as ""zany"" as possible and see how Matthau reacts to it.  If it weren't for Jerry Reed this film would have been nearly an hour and a half of forced jokes, gunshots, and awkward moments.  The story was pointless.  In most instances I can find bits and pieces of a story which keeps my attention allowing me to be curious about how the ending will resolve itself.  For there to be this resolution, there has to be a conflict.  Even a senior in high school can figure that out, but oddly enough, there is no conflict in The Survivors.  Ritchie attempts to create one with the entire ""survival of the fittest"" byline, but even that idea is never fully announced.  I felt like a Ping-Pong ball in this film, constantly going back and forth between Williams and Matthau hoping that I would land on something that scored a point, but alas, this was the game that would never end.  Ritchie even takes us into the wilderness in attempts to bring more laughs and eventually draw an ending, but again, nothing happens.  Nothing is explained, nothing is developed, nothing is linear.  Williams goes into the woods to be trained in survival, yet for the amount of time he was there it was as if he was unable to learn anything.  Also, where did he get the funds to buy the house out in the woods?  Then, without giving anything away, there was that pathetic ending.  WHAT HAPPENED?  I use big words there because there was not one iota of a conclusion.  Enemies became friends, friends became enemies, and before words could be spoken the ending credits appeared.  Ritchie obviously didn't have an ending and needed to quickly wrap it up, and it was very obvious.

I would like to announce this here, but I believe Michael Ritchie could not even handle the simplest of tasks with this film.  The direction was horrible because Ritchie could not control his actors.  It was obvious as you watched Williams and Matthau on screen that there were getting no advice or pointers from the man behind the camera.  Ritchie didn't stop Williams during his rants (which at times were never relevant to the film) and did not help Matthau react to the insanity that Williams was bringing to the table.  Even if you have a feeble story (such as this), you can possibly save the film with the actors.  Ritchie could not save this film.  What should have been the best part of this film was easily the most painful to watch.  Williams and Matthau, in this critic's eye, possibly could be ranked as the WORST comic pairing in cinema.  Matthau's form of comedy is completely, if not 100%, different to Williams' shenanigans.  While in some film cases this would work to a movie's advantage, for The Survivors, it did not.  There were no characters for these two comedians to enter into.  I sat during the entire hour and a half watching Robin Williams be Robin Williams and the same for Walter Matthau.  I could not see any semblance of a character between the two of them.  Both seemed to jump from one trait to the next.  Neither seemed to have a complete hold or knowledge of who they were attempting to portray.  This is half due to the flimsy story, but mainly I place the blame on Ritchie.  With Williams and Matthau at the helm, this had the beginnings of a hilarious possible gut-busting, laugh-out-loud comedy that would be a staple in the film community, but Ritchie, in my eyes, could not handle it.  He relied to heavily on his actor's comic ""personas"" instead of actually building characters for them.

 Overall, this was a very sad excuse for a film.  I have read some other reviews that speak highly of the comedy in this film while do speak similarly of the lacking story, but for me everything was broken.  There were no characters, there was no direction, there was obviously no story, and our two central actors didn't work for their money, but just read through their lines and gave a measly 30% to the final product.  The only plus I give this film is the accomplishment of Jerry Reed.  He was worth watching.  The scene between his wife and I was nearly close to perfection.  I think it was the only time that I found myself chuckling through this entire film.  Ritchie could not handle this film and in the end The Survivors is probably a film that neither Williams or Matthau wants to remember.  I know I am trying to forget it as we speak!

Williams goes crazy, arms himself to the teeth, and then joins a mercenary survival war school in the woods of Vermont. The robber wants to get rid of both Williams and Matthau for fear they can identify him, only Williams challenges him to a showdown in the snow in Vermont.

It's a wonderful romp, with the understated Matthau a perfect foil for Williams's off-the-wall zaniness. The movie falters somewhat in the woods of Vermont, with the anti-vigilante message becoming overly obtrusive, but there's enough hilarity to overlook it. A very funny movie.
