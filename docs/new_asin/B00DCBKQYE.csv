5788816,1,B00DCBKQYE,Incredibly boring!  not real.  Just some photos of orbs and the rest acting. Could have been so much better. Long silent shots for no reason.,1387756800,3,141,4.6
5788817,5,B00DCBKQYE,"Expect no gore which is what makes this such a gem. Somebody watched The Haunting (1963) and learned. Do not watch this film while holding a Pot-bellied Pig, just a heads up.",1387670400,,174,4.46875
5788818,5,B00DCBKQYE,The haunted house featured in this film exists in Australia. The house torments people who are unlucky enough to be in it alone. The movie requires you to fill in the missing pieces in order to figure out how the beginning connects to the end. I'd recommend this as an old-fashioned chiller from the days of yore before cgi.,1387584000,2,324,4.508474576271187
5788819,3,B00DCBKQYE,"film begins with police and a clearly disturbed man. he's shirtless, wandering the road with a sledgehammer.
you will NEVER know how or why this happens.

5788820,2,B00DCBKQYE,"The film has very few scares.  The acting isn't horrible, but it could be better.  The story goes at a snail's pace.  Not recommended.",1387324800,,134,4.5
5788821,5,B00DCBKQYE,"I've been waiting to see Muirhouse ever since the movie was announced, and was not disappointed. This is a film for fans of found footage movies like Paranormal Activity and Ghost Hunters.  I expected a good chilly ghost story and I got exactly that with great attention to the details, and some good scare tactics. It takes a bit for the scares to start, but when it does, its chilling. If you like a good haunted house film with some terrifying atmosphere, then this is the movie for you. I'm giving this a full recommendation folks, I had a good time, and I would suggest watching it in the dark with a clean pair of undies at hand.",1386892800,,635,4.38135593220339
5788822,4,B00DCBKQYE,"It is not like come of the newer movies where it is constant action it actually follows the good old horror movies where less is more. With sounds, anticipation and some jumps here and there. They don't make them like this anymore!",1386633600,,231,4.523809523809524
5788823,1,B00DCBKQYE,One of THE BIGGEST wastes of money I ever spent. This really IS NOT a film at all but a very stupid documentary about the Monte Cristo house itself. Could not have been MORE DISSAPOINTED.,1385078400,4,187,4.371428571428571

5788827,1,B00DCBKQYE,"If someone tells you to watch this movie, punch them square in the face as hard as possible because that person does not like you and wants to see you suffer. This may very well be the worst thing ever filmed. It has no redeeming value, there is nothing remotely scary about it. I would rather dive face first into a pool of my own vomit than watch this movie again.",1505865600,,366,4.169014084507042
5788828,2,B00DCBKQYE,"*SPOILERS* It took four tries to make it clear to the end of this movie. However, the actor playing Muirhouse did a fair job considering he had to carry the movie by himself, and mostly in the dark. Other than that, it was like they were making the movie but suddenly ran out of funds so they had to scrunch down the plot, the ending (told at the beginning), and why, out of all the people dealing with this place, that whatever it was, was so pissed off by him.

This time I made it to the end just to find out what the hell happened. I refuse to speculate and just guess according to what the beginning of this movie tells you. Because that's what they did. They either ran out of money or ideas because what could have been a decent slow-burner of a found footage movie gives you the ultimate finger and doesn't explain ANYTHING. The estate is beautiful, and for that I gave it two more stars than it deserved.",1503619200,,913,4.247126436781609

5788831,2,B00DCBKQYE,"If you're having trouble getting to sleep I highly recommend this movie. It will put you to sleep faster than Nyquil with a shot of whiskey. Slow, plodding, dull,boring, and slow with an ambiguous ending that isn't.",1502755200,,215,4.837837837837838
5788832,1,B00DCBKQYE,"There's really no ending to this movie, it just kinda stops.  So, you think maybe there will be more after the credits roll, and there is, but it doesn't really end the movie either.  I wouldn't mind a slow suspenseful build like this (most of the film is a guy walking around with a flashlight, asking ""who's there?"") if there's a payoff at the end, but there's nothing.  Very disappointing.",1502323200,,392,4.571428571428571
5788833,2,B00DCBKQYE,"The genre of the ""hidden footage"" movies is done to death in my opinion tho a really good one is like striking gold on Amazon Prime these days. So I continue to try these film styles of Movies to hopefully find gold...this is NOT one of those. I really wanted to like this movie b/c I have heard of that ""Haunted"" house before. However at the beginning & ending we are shown something that may have happened there while this man is alone and according to a police radio we are told 3 ppl were found dead there. Then we are told we will see what leads up to this man's arrest at the very beginning...we see him going after a Cop with a hammer, no shirt on and blood on his body...
However the middle doesn't give us anything that would warrant this man's arrest. Instead we witness him freaking out (tho he is supposed to be a professional) at every bump and the lights keep going out. The film crew never came? Why? He continued to go out to a barn to put the circuit breaker back on and then he went back into the house, Why? IF he was so terrified (BTW his hand held camera must have a very good battery pack) why didn't he just stay out side? This was yet another Blair Witch hunt that could have been good IF they gave us more to go on as far as what happened to this now crazy man walking along the street...Don't bother looking nothing is ever shown to us as promised. I have no idea who died there but a woman does come in the a.m. and starts hearing the same noises...did he kill her? I DK...don't even bother with this one. It builds but doesn't deliver.",1483574400,4,1563,4.161716171617162

5788836,1,B00DCBKQYE,"Dull and dumb.  A complete waste of time.  There is no plot, the acting is terrible, there is nothing scary, and the end makes no sense.

5788837,2,B00DCBKQYE,"As a huge fan of found footage/mockumentary style films, I was excited for this seemingly acclaimed film. Was it creepy? Yes. Did it build suspense? Yes. Was it downright scary? Yes. Did it end abruptly with absolutely no warning leaving the viewer to feel as if the movie was half-finished and there was still more movie to see? YES.",1475798400,,334,4.677966101694915

5788839,5,B00DCBKQYE,"It's funny to read the other reviews. I'm guessing the higher ratings are from us older folks, who find enjoyment in subtlety. And the lower ratings are from the younger crowd who think horror movies have to be explicit to be scary or entertaining. This was a fun and scary movie. It wasn't until after I watched it that I found out this was filmed in an actual haunted house in Australia. The house is gorgeous, but creepy. The scares are good, there's a lot of build up to them, hence the boredom of some viewers. But to me, this just added to the suspense. And nothing was overtly shown so your mind could fill in the horrifying blanks. I highly recommend it.",1475452800,9,662,4.390243902439025
5788840,1,B00DCBKQYE,"To be completely up front, I watch mostly horror movies.  Always trying to find something that will actually scare me a bit, or at least do something new and incredible to behold.  So, I end up watching a lot of found-footage movies.

This is by far the worst one I have seen to date.  Unless you're going to be entertained by people slamming doors, stomping up and down stairs, or knocking on walls, there's only about 15 seconds of anything interesting to see here.  You get one flash of something flying past the camera, and one other still shot of what could have been something odd, but that the character doesn't even react to, so you're left wondering.  The rest of the movie is ""Oh noes, they turned off the power again, I have to go back to the fusebox"" or ""what was that noise?""  Some of the documentary stuff at the beginning is interesting, but that's not why you watch something like this.

There was one thing I'm curious about; if you watch right at the 22-minute mark, the cameraman enters a room with something standing right next to the bed, but he doesn't seem to pay it any mind.  Any idea what it is?  To me, I thought we were seeing the first ""entity"" but the lack of reaction made me wonder if it was just strangely-stacked items?",1475452800,4,1253,4.408695652173913
5788841,5,B00DCBKQYE,"This is one of the best haunted house movies I've seen in ages -- it's a wonderful slow build, full of so much tension and creepy in an understated way. If you're a horror fan who actually likes the genre and prefers the original version of the Haunting to the abysmal remake in the 90's, you'll probably like this one a lot. I certainly did, and the performance of the main character was fantastic. Loved the way the movie was presented, a cross between mockumentary/found footage but it worked PERFECTLY. Really impressed with this and I wish the ratings were higher, people might pass this by thinking it's just another one of those awful horror movies that pop up on Prime, but trust me, this is a diamond in the rough.",1473724800,7,723,4.526717557251908

5788845,2,B00DCBKQYE,"I watched all the way through.  Mainly because the main character is a hottie.  I wanted to like it but honestly it was just hottie walking from room to room in the dark hearing loud bangs.  His ""terrified"" act wasn't very convincing either.

As an avid horror film viewer, I decided to watch Muirhouse to see for myself if it was a diamond in the rough, but ended up with a lump of coal. The beginning of the film seems promising; however, once the main character enters the haunted house you are left with a hollow and uneventful viewing experience.",1464825600,,517,4.6923076923076925

5788858,5,B00DCBKQYE,"Muirhouse is a thinking person's 'ghost story' or 'haunted house"" tale. We are treated with the historical facts of the Monte Cristo homestead in the run-up to the night spent in the house.  What is brought out in supposition are the actual 'facts' as associated with this real 'haunted' house/homestead in Australia.  You are free to investigate for yourself just as I did.
I liked that the story was told in detail, that time was taken to build a good foundation, that we are allowed to get a better take on our protagonist than normal in this type of film.  The mood is satisfyingly creepy, the house itself a historical gem and the camera work excellent.  None of the scenes are too dark to actually see the action, which is a pet-peeve of mine, but strike a fine balance.
I hope you give Muirhouse a chance to draw you into this unfortunate night, the night Phillip Muirhouse broke the 1st rule of 'ghost hunting': NEVER go in alone!

*PS  I did not mean to imply this story is true, it is a fiction.  The history of the Monte Cristo homestead is what is accurate.  Thanks for reading my thoughts and I hope you enjoy the show, I sure did.",1452902400,,1144,4.440191387559809

5788861,1,B00DCBKQYE,"I'm generally more forgiving of ""Found Footage"" films, but wow- what a snore.
I guess I should say spoiler alert, but there's almost nothing to spoil because for 115 minutes, nearly NOTHING happens.
The film has has competent production and acting. All the more the pity for the result.
We start with the aftermath - main character on the streets with a hammer, getting arrested.
Then the lead up to the haunt - I get that they were going for a sober realistic documentary approach, but it was reeeeeallllly slllloooowwww - - - - -paced.
I appreciate a slow burn, but this was a slooooooww buuuuuurn that culminates in - a faint smolder.
At one point the static camera is fixed on a reel to reel player turning  for what seems like several minutes, the payoff being a few far flung brief moments of crackling on top of  indistinct murmurs.  The whole film has that dynamic.

SPOILER PART ( I guess) The found footage of the haunting incident consisted of this guy going from room to room. After a painfully drawn out tour. He follows some thumping. At one point the lights go out. He freaks. Then a few minutes of his flashlight looking for the circuit box.
Then some dining room chairs are found (gasp) ON THE TABLE! He freaks some more. More looking at things with his flashlight.
Then he gets dragged away into a wardrobe.

Not like any of the money is going to better the lives of the employees just the top level trolls at the top get to line their pockets with more gold while the people working the shipping floor get docked for taking a second restroom break in 6 hrs.

This movie is crap should be used by the CIA to torture people that is how bad it is. Play it on the border and people won't want to cross over into America due to having to watch it while crossing.

But it did actually win the best foreign film category in the Louisville, KY film fest,  bless their pointed little heads. The film tries to be like Paranormal Activity, but doesn't grasp the finesse that is required to make poor lighting and 'found footage' compelling.  It tries to be like Blair Witch Project and succeeds in showing the green-lit, scaredy-faced ""professional ghost hunter and author"" being 500x more wimpy and spastic than the Blair Witch girls at their worst.

I must have a brain aneurism (I was going to look up how to spell that word, but for this movie I figured why waste the effort.)  What did I like about this movie?  The end credits.  Plus, the fact they saved tons of valuable production dollars by not offering any background music.  A good sound track would've made all the difference.  I might've given it 2.000001 stars instead.  They saved even more by hand-held cameras and basically one actor.  Why pay people when you can simply have them phone in their performance.  I gave it two stars for the post editing.  I mean, it could've really been a badder (not concerned if that's a word or not) movie if they didn't have a great editor.  I started making comments to myself just to provide a little entertainment.  My favorite was during the chair stacking scene.  I said, (out loud by the way), ""I think he's upset some interior decorators to make them move those chairs like that.""  I know.  It's not funny, but neither is this movie.  Oh wait, it's not a comedy.  Which is ok.  Since it's definitely not a horror/thriller/suspense movie either.

Great setting, great audio work, good acting. The early bits are somewhat disjointed but do a good job at setting up the background and atmosphere. Then ending is really strong, watch it until the video runs out.

The middle is a bit more mixed, though the perspective works well. The understated effects work excellently here and I think they could maybe have pulled back on a couple visual jump scares for a bit more shadow creep tension builder effects ala Paranormal Activity. My only real complaint is that at the height of the movie the camera work gets a bit touristy, just long enough to start to break the tension - a little more focus through that section and it would've been golden.

Ultimately one of the better found footage implementations of slow tension building. As I said early on, it's very Lovecraftian, maybe the best movie execution of Lovecraft's writing style, even down to the opening setup of the protagonist's wild-eyed state.",1390521600,,1154,4.818181818181818

History tells us this so I guess the writers, directors, etc... of these rehashed movies don't watch/read history and sadly the old saying keeps proving itself to be correct.

He may or may not be the main character.  But the police report there was 3 people killed in the house that the main character was investigating.  He is a writer/ghost hunter, and is making a documentary of the farm that is allegedly the most haunted house in Australia.  I have seen other reports about this house and its environs.  The main character is somehow left alone at the house for the night.  Hints are made that it is not good to investigate haunted houses alone.  It is in fact against the 'Ghost hunter's creed'.  Lights go on, lights go off.  Furniture is moved, but the movers appear to be thoughtful about it.  No damage to the furniture was done.  Part of the story gets moved into a second house on the property which may have been a carriage house.  A man in the credits is listed as the 3D animator, but the only effect that is seen is a brief backwards shot of a man falling out of a wardrobe, so he looks like he is being thrown in.  The whole thing seems about as random as this review.  I like found footage films (if they are good) and paranormal investigation films (again, if they are good), but this is in need of a good storyteller and a good editor.

Yet it is the first movie I've seen out of dozens I've watched  in the horror/thriller genre here on Amazon
that genuinely produced a nervousness, a jumpiness, and made me want to turn on a few more lights in
my house.  It's just a guy (paranormal researcher) alone at night in a haunted house, waiting for the rest
of his crew to arrive.  Then the noises start.  A few kinetic events occur involving chairs, lights and doors,
and that's about it.  But it produces a tension that none of the slasher gore fests ever did.  I suppose it's
just so low-key and real that in a sense, it's easy to relate to.

Yes, it's a little slow at times; no, there is no final tidying up of the storyline, for there really is almost no
story, just a depiction of this guy's experience while in the house.  The house is big and old and interesting,
so gives you a lot to look at during the slow scenes.  And actually, all the ""slow"" scenes contribute to the
building of nervousness and tension, even though you might feel a bit impatient at the time.

If you only like the slasher-type movies, or ones with palpable monsters, a lot of screaming and chasing and
action (which I do watch and find entertaining if they're good), you probably won't like this, because it is
definitely tame by these standards.  But if you like just a plain, real-feeling haunted house experience every
once in a while, this film will satisfy.",1524787200,,1508,4.5036764705882355
8591652,2,B00DCBKQYE,"This one completely slipped my notice multiple times, and I had no interest but boredom when I put it on. It proceeded to take an ungodly amount of time to get to the actual story, but somehow managed to keep me intrigued with a litany of seemingly loosely related snippets involving Muirhouse talking about ghost hunting and what he does, discussing it on a radio show or via interviews.

Then we begin with him going into a haunted house with his setup of cameras, and he almost immediately starts getting the spooky ghosty encounters.

The way they were executed and filmed was sublime in its subtlety, and at most points is ambivalent enough to be unclear if it actually is a spooky ghost or a home invader seeking solely to scare and harass him as he ghost hunts.

The ""jump scare"" moments are fairly typical but also incredibly creepy given the ""found footage"" realism-style it was going for.

But once it reaches a long, extended sequence of quiet dread, in which you're left looking over every inch of the screen for any sign of something anomalous while Muirhouse is just staring around, waiting to hear something pounding upstairs or a door slamming again, it abruptly goes all-in with its ghostly climax...

And then it just suddenly ends.

I'm someone who absolutely loves certain things, and in particular found footage horror/sci fi movies, even if they're terrible. If they manage to become genuinely exciting or compelling, I often prefer them to not be overly long or indulgent for fear of spoiling the experience.
