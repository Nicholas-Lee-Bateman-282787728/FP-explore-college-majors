7734311,4,B01EBBTQ1M,"Even though I'm not much of a musical person, this movie was actually really funny. I would put 5 stars but 4 stars because I don't like musicals.",1463961600,,146,4.25
7734312,5,B01EBBTQ1M,LOVE this movie!,1463961600,,16,4.666666666666667
7734313,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"A hundred-minute non-stop smile, ""Waiting In The Wings"" pays tribute to the history of musical theater and film in its near entirety, yet never descends into parody. The songs (by various composers) are clever, catchy and sometimes wise; the pastiche-y dance numbers wear their influences on their brightly colored sleeves; and the skillful cast is uniformly committed and charming. In a movie dotted with celebrity cameos (Shirley Jones and Lee Meriweather among them), Sally Struthers' five-minute bit is a comedy gem, an exercise in deadpan worthy of Thelma Ritter. If you blink, you'll miss it - and you don't want to miss it!",1463961600,,630,5.12621359223301
7734314,5,B01EBBTQ1M,Saw this film with a friend and didn't know what to expect.  What I found was a fun movie with great music and acting.  This is coming from someone who doesn't pick musicals.  I was laughing and singing along with the songs.  Highly recommend this film!,1463875200,,253,4.434782608695652
7734315,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"A ""MUST SEE"" for musical theater fans...or even just comedy fans!  This hilarious tale tells the story of a mix-up with the casting of two quite different shows - there's music, dancing, theater, comedy, drama, cameos from Shirley Jones, Sally Struthers, and more!  You will NOT be disappointed with this fun-filled musical comedy which also has a great message.  Check it out now!  Looking forward to the sequel!",1463875200,,413,5.029411764705882
7734316,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"A movie with heart, wit, and true dedication to the American Musical genre.  The scenes go from the romantic to the hilarious to the bawdy.  The dialogue is quick-moving and the songs will have you tapping your toes and singing along in no time.  I bought one for myself and one to give as a gift.",1463788800,,297,4.267857142857143

7734324,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"I saw this at a film festival, and couldn't wait until it was available to watch again. The tunes are well done and catchy... yes, you WILL be singing some of them if that's the kind of thing you do. The actors are great, and the story - improbable - as all the best musical stories are - is hilarious. I got one for my musical-theater-loving friends . . . and they love it, too. Next time I watch it will be at a summer film party with the theater gang in my living room. Fun!",1463616000,,477,3.9791666666666665

7734326,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"What can I say ""Gays, Jews and Girls Who Need Love"" is catchy...as are most of the songs on this musical. Waiting in the Wings is a breath of fresh air. The cast brings a interesting take on how to make it in the business. It was fun to watch and the cameo appearances from the likes of Shirley Jones, Sally Strutters, and the great Lee Meriwether left me wanting more. I hear there is going to be a sequel and I can't wait to see it!",1463616000,,434,4.0

8758287,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"To put it simply, with tongue in cheek, this movie is just a lot of good ol' fashioned, plain fun.  If you go into knit-picking and rolling your eyes, stop the movie, take a breath, and start over.  Just go with it for what it is......a fun movie with a good sense of humor.",1475712000,,274,4.055555555555555

8758289,5,B01EBBTQ1M,"Just finished watching ""Waiting In The Wings - The Musical"" released by JJ Spotlight Productions. [Jeff H. didn't watch this with me because he hates musicals - unless it's a Disney Musical.]
""Waiting In The Wings - The Musical"" is a great musical screwball comedy tribute to the classic musicals from Broadway's Golden Age.
The basic premise behind ""Waiting In The Wings - The Musical"" is simple:  Two aspiring performers - Anthony, a mid-Western musical geek enters a contest to star in an off Broadway production; while Tony, a New York Stripper, enters a contest to America's next great male stripper.  Both contests are being run by the same agency and a switch-up causes Anthony and Tony to be cast in the opposite productions - Anthony must learn how to become a stripper and Tony must learn how to be the male lead in a musical.
The misadventures of Anthony and Tony are great fun as they unfold; and each learns that they have what it takes to succeed at the opportunities life throws at them.
Now, there is supposed to a sequel to this little gem of a movie musical comedy, and I hope it gets produced soon!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
TEN STARS!",1465776000,2,1148,4.650246305418719
