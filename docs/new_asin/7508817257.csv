Despite this being advertised as:""All men are brothers 11 DVD /China movie and production / English subtitle"", there are no English sub-titles and you only receive some of the episodes (there are 86 in all but you only receive half a dozen. A mega rip=off if ever there was one! So, unless you speak Mandarin - forget it. This is NOT what it is advertised as. Shame on Amazon!!!!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-Men-Are-Brothers-Shui-Hu-Chuan/dp/1559213035/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All Men Are Brothers / Shui Hu Chuan</a>",1344988800,7,580,6.172839506172839
