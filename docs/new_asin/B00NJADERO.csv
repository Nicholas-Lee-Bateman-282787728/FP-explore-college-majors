8678676,5,B00NJADERO,"It is a film documentary about devotion for the goddess Raha in India., directed by Prashant Bahargava. Colorful and beauty ,but for me the more import  thing is the beautiful music of Vijay Iyer and the International Contemporary Ensemble. Is also an homenage to Igor Stravisky and Nijinsky's ""Le scare du Piemtemps"" . He used the same twelve episode to conduct us for diferents stages. The film include the performance of Nawazuddin Siddqui and Beatrice Ordeix.  There is also a documentary was directed by Ross Karre and produced by ECM. Is really incredible, a beautiful experience of sound and color
