4483380,5,B004VM2FKG,"I respect Mary Ann a lot.  Her exercise programs look so simple but are surprisingly effective.  She shows on our PBS station but they changed her time so I rarely see her now.  She has several programs but I've always remembered this one because of the hand exercises.  I have mostly MS and a little arthritis now.

I bought this program for her hand exercises (but do work the whole program).  I have been unable to find the finger balls but I do the exercises without them and it still feels good. I am assuming that arthritis will spread throughout my body eventually so I'm ahead if I start exercising my whole body now with these exercises, right?  I really enjoy her exercises.",1351814400,30,684,4.512195121951219
4483381,2,B004VM2FKG,"The exercise is ok, but it is slow in getting started, then there are interuptions with conversation. I think if they want to give advice from the American Arthritis foundation, it should be in the very beginning. Once I am exercising I don't want to stop...  I found that it was not a good purchase for me.

4483392,5,B004VM2FKG,"God bless this woman. She has been lifting spirits of those fighting for mobility and increased strength for years. She's makes the workouts entirely do-able in a chair, but even a fit person who does not need so much chair activity, can get a sweat and a smile out out of this. Her voice and encouragement are pleasing - not annoying and hyper. This is a fine series of exercise dvd's, especially if you are restricted and a little down about it.  She'll pick you right up. I am not a geriatric person, just disabled...and I find her to be appealing to all ages. p.s. double check, some workouts call for a few props - specific sized balls, light weights, and a long towel/band for lifting legs.",1514764800,5,696,4.480314960629921

Taught by an RN who looks to be 65+, this PBS series exercise instructor has this good light seated exercise DVD. I bought this for my 70 year old mom who has never been into exercise and has been having some nueroligical problems, feeling wobbly and slightly dizzy, she needed a seated exercise she could do at home. There is one portion you must stand and hold onto the back of a chair, but she says it's pretty easy and gentle. Exercise at all ages is essential and I needed her to start moving again, it's better for us all. She says this is a fairly easy to follow and has gentle movements, there are 3 thirty minute workouts. She sees it's helped her flexibility, but added bonus, she feels her balance has improved greatly.",1483142400,8,809,4.436241610738255

I specifically bought this as a chair exercise as indicated by the title ""sit adn fit"" and the picture of the women in a chair/ But thee she is doing standing stretches including lunge position stretches putting weight on bended knee.  The whole reason for buying a chair excersise is to NOT put weight on my already aching knees. The quality is cheap There is really annoying I mean really annoying cheap music overdubbed. There is a supposed menu but once in a segment the only way out it to eject the disk and reload it.  I lan to return this as a substandard product.",1472688000,19,810,4.13375796178344

Cons:  No closed-captioning for the hearing impaired.

I called the Sit and Fit website to ask why they would not provide captions and was told they do have captions on THEIR Arthritis Sit and Fit DVD, but that they sell the contents of some of their exercise videos to other companies that put together these types of videos in a piecemeal fashion - and that company chooses to provide CC or not. If you go to the Sit and Fit website, please beware - not all the ""original"" Sit and Fit videos are CC but the dvd description on the website will tell you if it provides CC.
If you are in need of CLOSED CAPTIONS - Pass this by and go to Sit and Fit website and order the real thing!

have always triggered bursitis or some other painful reaction/injury. I found with ""SIT & BE FIT"" that I had some mild muscle soreness
in a couple of spots it was nothing serious. I was also using a 3# hand weight the first time which I put aside for the time being. I am
happy with this video as I believe it will keep me from doing too much too soon resulting in injury. For now, it is where I am and it is
a challenge.",1366934400,43,690,4.18796992481203

However, it was far too advanced and difficult for my mom. We tried to do it while the physical therapist was over and she thought it was ridiculous. She said this was not for anyone suffering from severe rheumatoid or osteo arthritis.
