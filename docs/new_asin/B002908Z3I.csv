At approximately 24 minutes the author, Carl Sommer is reading the story, The Sly Fox and the Chicks, to a group of children. As he reads the viewer gets up close pictures of the illustrations in the book. Periodically Carl stops to ask the kids a question ensuring that they are listening to him.

Sly Fox is hungry for chicks! Papa Rooster and Mama Hen have told their children to stay away from the sly fox. Clucky always says he will never talk to strangers however we all know how sly a fox i.e. stranger can be. Finding a lamb skin the sly old fox dresses up. Even Gruffy the dog is fooled, going back to sleep. Clucky keeps his word and does not talk to the fox but Penny, his sister, does! Admittedly she tells him that they don't talk to strangers but as the author points out and as you listen to the story, at first the chicks run from the fox then as he continues to come back daily the ""threat"" dissipates. It is not many days before Penny and her two friends are following the fox to where there is more delicious corn after accepting some kernels (i.e. sweets) from the fox.

For those who want to know, this story does NOT have a happy ending for everyone but a VERY valuable lesson that needs to be learned. Highly recommend this for young ones. We have the book to go along with this too so as to reinforce the lesson.",1447718400,,1584,4.3120805369127515
