4403804,4,B004LS6CMC,Movie starts with a bang and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Your holding your breath and waiting to see what happens next. Over all its an AWESOME movie. Luke Goss is a believable actor,1346630400,,190,4.162162162162162
4403805,1,B004LS6CMC,"why is 50cent even on the cover he is only in the movie for like 5 minutes.
i guess thay needed a famous face to sell the lies",1315526400,3,126,3.5357142857142856
4403806,1,B004LS6CMC,I was so displeased with Blood Out.  I could not believe that Liongate put its name on this film. It totally looked boot-legged to me. Fancy,1307664000,3,140,4.384615384615385
4403807,2,B004LS6CMC,"What do you do when the law doesn't help?  After his brother is brutally murdered Sherriff Spencer (Luke Goss) is let down by the people he hoped would help.  Taking matters into his own hands he goes undercover in the gang that did it in order to get revenge.  Looking at the cover it seems like another 50-cent/Val Kilmer movie, which makes you think twice about getting it.  Vinnie Jones, Fiddy and Kilmer have a total screen time of about 2 minutes.  Luke Goss is the main star of the movie.  I was not expecting alot being that I thought it as a 50 cent/Kilmer movie, although ""Gun"" was not as bad as I expected so I had a little more expectations for this one.  This was a movie that started off flat and never improved. The acting wasn't as bad as I expected though. It was not terrible, but had all the drama and excitement of watching a dog play fetch, fun for a while then just sitting waiting for it to end.  This is a movie that a lot of people will like, I just can't get into this kind of thing.  I give it a C-.

Would I watch again? - No I wouldn't",1303862400,4,1064,4.096618357487923
4403808,1,B004LS6CMC,"...horrendous performances, script and dialogue. Luke Gross is about the only actor to survive this cringe-worthy mess with any semblance of credibility. Would have given it a Zero is possible. My fast forward button was prominently used to get through this garbage. At least I had a credit from Red Box so didn't have to the suffer the indignity of paying to watch this drivel.",1303776000,,378,4.8307692307692305
4403809,4,B004LS6CMC,"Blood out is a good movie with a decent balance of action and character development. Michael is easy to like, especially if you enjoy tortured heroes. He's rugged but not lacking in emotion. The female lead expectedly flaunts her sexuality, but she's not just window dressing. It would have been nice to see her role expanded even more because she is an interesting character. Most of the secondary characters are also well done. This movie is about revenge, but also about redemption. Luke Goss fans and action fans in general don't miss this one. If I could rate this 4.5 I would have, since it's better than a 4.",1303776000,,615,4.651376146788991
4403810,3,B004LS6CMC,"I had no expectations for this film so my poor review has nothing to do with expecting something decent, but there has been a bit of confusion with customers regarding this and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gun-Blu-ray/dp/B0046JLTLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gun [Blu-ray</a>]; they both have 50 Cent and Kilmer, they both have the same cover art and they are both really bad.

A standard cop revenge film with some solid urban music, hot ladies doing nasty things and Val Kilmer looking more and more like that great&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/American-Dad-Vol-6/dp/B003L77G7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">American Dad!, Vol. 6</a>&nbsp;quote about becoming a pumpkin. But what surprised me is how incredible the BD quality is - flawless. The night shots, the close-ups, and even the out of focus shots all looked amazingly clear and vibrant. Albeit this was difficult to see at times (did several pause-check stops to test clarity) as the director chose to do the really shaky-cam thing - irritating. The DTS was mixed well with only one editing flaw in the whole movie. Now for the laundry list of problems...

Those looking for 50 Cent will be disappointed as he is in the movie for only a few minutes (but is prominently placed on the cover art). Val Kilmer walks onto the set for one sequence and was horrible. Vinnie Jones has a couple of sequences but he muddled through the lines (although he does get the cheesy car chase scene at the end of the film) - so the film rests on Luke Goss. He performs on par, but the best acting was actually from Ed Quinn of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Eureka-Season-Two/dp/B0017INRFE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Eureka: Season Two</a>. The cover art is so misleading with Luke Goss being given fourth billing but he is in almost every scene.

The only supplement is a 16-minute interview piece that is clip-heavy and self congratulatory. Region coded A, English and Spanish subs. 1.5 stars for the film and 1.5 for the BD specs. A renter maybe, but you would have to be a hardcore Goss fan.",1303430400,6,2170,5.589665653495441
4403811,4,B004LS6CMC,Luke Goss knows how to carry a film.  In all his films he puts his whole persona into it.  50cent has the BA qualities you need and Val Kilmer well he is just all around interesting!  I really liked what I have seen so far and can not wait to get this into my DVD collection!  Thanks Luke for making great films!,1301788800,3,312,3.9838709677419355

4403856,1,B004LS6CMC,"This is just a ridiculously bad movie. I TRIED to watch it on TMC on demand but could only stomach so much so I turned it off a little morecthan half way through.  The actor who played the main character, Luke Goss was actually very good here. But that's about it.  Dumb story, bad acting dominate here. I guess I won't be adding this to my dvd collection.",1413331200,,356,4.220588235294118

4403858,5,B004LS6CMC,"Many well-known actors, but one that really stood out was Luke Goss.  I hadn't seen him in other movies; he played a cop/gangster believably.  I loved to see him kick ass.",1401408000,,171,4.483870967741935
4403859,1,B004LS6CMC,Don't waste your time or money on it. It's just plain not worth it. This is another one that went in the round file.,1385856000,,116,3.875
4403860,4,B004LS6CMC,I would not let children or young adults view this movie.  It has too much bad language and too much killing.  cerich1,1383264000,,118,4.318181818181818
4403871,4,B004LS6CMC,Lots of death. Not for the little ones. Was much more involved than just a typical action movie. A good way to spend an evening with my action-addicted better half.,1381622400,,164,4.5
4403872,1,B004LS6CMC,This movie had some of the worst acting that I have ever seen; the fight seens were a joke. The skinny sickly looking female hero was a joke;the Australian accent which was suppose to be a street slang was a joke. I want my 1.99 back from this movie,1370563200,2,249,4.1020408163265305
4403873,5,B004LS6CMC,I think a really good movie it  has some really good action parts in it and also some really sad parts,1370390400,,102,3.857142857142857

4403879,4,B004LS6CMC,Luke Goss is a good actor. I am amazed at how he sounds so American when he actually has an English accent. His acting is believable.,1359936000,,133,4.153846153846154
4403880,2,B004LS6CMC,Bought this a part of a special deal.  Boring C-grade.  The only good perfomance is by Lucke Goss.  Save your cash.,1358726400,,115,4.380952380952381

8434714,2,B004LS6CMC,"Normally I like movies like these.  I'll take exception to this one.  The only redeeming thing about it was Half a Buck got his rear kicked.

Val Kilmer is looking very rough in this movie.  And the ""soundtrack"" adds nothing of value.",1484611200,,234,4.5
