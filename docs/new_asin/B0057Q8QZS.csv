4597690,5,B0057Q8QZS,"I'm a fan of Shirley, but there are some films on here that the quality of them aren't watchable. The only decent watchable is The Little Princess. The quality of A Boy a Girl and a Dog, The Green Promise, Mickey and The Miracle on 34th Street were not that great. Overall this is a nice collection, but I wouldn't recommend it.",1363132800,4,328,4.306451612903226

4597698,2,B0057Q8QZS,"This product has two DVDs where Shirley Temple appears.

The first DVD has her class film adaptation, ""The Little Princess."" She is the star of the film. She appears very briefly in ""Law of Vengeance"" and ""The Red Haired Alibi."" The documentary here is done with information and clips of her works only here.

The second DVD has several short films where she played Mary Lou Rodgers in some of them.

There are some disturbing short films like ""Glad Rags to Riches;"" ""Kid n' Africa;"" ""Kid n' Hollywood;"" and ""Polly Tix in Washington."" At the time, these films were spoofs of kids playing adults in adult scenarios.

The third disc features a few Our Gang comedy shorts that are adorable but no Shirley Temple. The fourth disc is also Shirley free.

This product's intent is misleading since Shirley Temple is prominent on half of the discs here. Now I watched everything here. The film quality is fine even over time. The preservation still holds up on DVDs.

I gave two stars for the Shirley Temple DVDs. I would have given more if they featured more of her. You can see her star shining at an early age.",1400457600,5,1105,4.583756345177665
4597699,5,B0057Q8QZS,I enjoy to watch her. She is a sweet and loving person.  I will always remember her as the little Princess of TV.,1397520000,,113,3.9130434782608696
4597700,2,B0057Q8QZS,"I just watched this. It says 8 classic movies and 15 short films. A waste of time.
I'm a HUGE Shirley Temple fan but this DVD collection is mostly when she is 3y.o and has only a few lines (a couple of minutes dialogue (only) in the entire film).
She's not even in the credits for almost all of these.
In some movies I don't think she was in them at all! I couldn't find her.
The Little Princess had a lot of her though.

I think it would be better to buy the Shirley Temple Little Darling Collection (as seen on her official website).
That's when she was about 7y.o and up and included all her most famous fabulous roles.

I bought it for $20 in Australia.
I hope that helps you make a more informed choice.",1395446400,15,708,4.1231884057971016
4597701,5,B0057Q8QZS,"Another story that catches our hearts, Shirley is such a natural.. great memories for us older ones and enjoyment to young ones perhaps meeting her for the first time.  such talent from such a early age  .A  must for your Movie collection.",1394841600,,239,4.642857142857143
4597702,5,B0057Q8QZS,"This is the only rating I could consider for Shirley Temple.  As a child I was an avid fan. I followed her career closely and derived so  much enjoyment from her movies.  even in her teens, and was quite upset that she was released because she  grew up.  To this day I can find myself turning to her movies for my enjoyment at age 82.  Im indebted to Amazon for making it possible to purchase the colorized versions todaty.",1393632000,4,423,4.291139240506329
4597703,5,B0057Q8QZS,Very entertaining. Plus it is not just Shirley Temple movies. There are some other movies on the last 2 discs. I love to watch the old movies. You do not have to have sex and violence to sell movies.,1390780800,,199,4.128205128205129
4597704,3,B0057Q8QZS,Contains one of my favorite movies of hers-the Little Princess. 2 of the 4 discs are just her very early shorts and the quality is only fair. The other full length movies are early ones and she has extremely minor rolls. Also includes Miracle on 34th St in which she did not appear but has child star Natalie Wood and I love this version. Also includes a short bio of her with a few movie clips but all the clips are of her very early stuff and does not mention her full length movies nor has any pictures of her after about 1936. But the price was less the $5 so figured I would take a chance.,1389571200,12,594,4.085470085470085

8461102,4,B0057Q8QZS,"If you already own all of Shirley Temple's major films from Fox, you should also consider buying this set as an extra ""addition"" to the Shirley library.  This set has many of Temple's early pre-stardom film appearances, including her small supporting roles in ""Red-Haired Alibi"" (1932) and ""Law of Vengeance"" (1933, originally titled ""To the Last Man""); the latter starring Randolph Scott, who, several years later, would play opposite Shirley in ""Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm"" and ""Susannah of the Mounties"".

""The Little Princess"" (1939), Temple's first Technicolor film at Fox is here, albeit minus the opening credits sequence.  It's arguably Shirley's most popular movie, an adaptation of Frances Hodgson Burnett's classic children's novel. During the height of the Boer War, little Sara Crewe (Temple) is left at an exclusive girl's boarding school while her widower father goes back to the front. When he's later reported as missing believed killed - on her birthday yet! - little Sara is forced to become a scullery maid in order to pay back the fortune which her father owed in tuition fees and board. Never once doubting her father is still alive, Sara clings to her faith that one day her daddy will return.  Co-starring Cesar Romero (barely recognizable under an Indian turban and dark makeup), Anita Louise as kindly teacher Miss Rose, Richard Greene as her secret beau; and Mary Nash (a frequent Temple nemesis) as the witchy boarding school principal Miss Minchin, ""The Little Princess"" gave Temple one of her most demanding acting assignments, with a strong script from Ethel Hill and Walter Ferris that pulls no punches with some of the harsher, dramatic details from the original book-source. Sybil Jason is a delight playing Sara's best friend Becky, a cockney servant girl; and in a departure from her previous role in Temple's ""Heidi"" as sweet wheelchair-bound Clara, teenaged Marcia Mae Jones is the haughty Lavinia. Temple also shares a wonderful musical number with Arthur Treacher (""Knocked 'Em in the Old Kent Road"").

This set also has many of the ""Baby Burlesks"" and ""Frolics of Youth"" short subjects, plus the vintage newsreel compilation ""Biggest Lil' Star of the 30's"" which has footage of Shirley riding her custom-made roadster on the Fox backlot.  Adding some charm - but completely unrelated to Shirley Temple - are several ""Our Gang"" short subjects, in addition to a fabulous print of the delightful 1939 programmer ""Nancy Drew... Reporter"" starring Bonita Granville, Natalie Wood in ""The Green Promise"" (1949), ""Mickey"" (1948), ""A Boy, a Girl and a Dog"" (1946), and the 1955 TV version of ""Miracle on 34th Street"".",1441670400,4,2649,5.134570765661253
