8265810,5,B0017GN9QS,"This film was made as a companion film to Paul Newman's classic, HUD... this is no companion film. ROBERT SHAW starts this film off with a kidnapping of a young boy and places him inside an abandaned home. He locks the child inside a bedroom with a doll to entertain him... the only thing that makes this doll, ""Special,"" as ROBERT SHAW says with crazed laughter, is the fact he has inserted a bomb inside of it to explode TOMORROW AT TEN. ""Enough explosives to blow off half the house."" ROBERT SHAW calmly tells the boys father. SHAW is asking a ransom and in return will tell the boys father where his son is... when he is safely in another country. The boys father agrees to his terms and the money is delivered, but, the housekeeper has done something, rather rash. She has alerted the police of the situation and the detective (JOHN GREGSON) arrives. He has no intention of letting SHAW off the hook so easily. Without giving to much of the story away, these three fine actors give great preformances. Their acting holds your attention without a doubt. Good twists keep the movie interestion throughout. I would have prefered an ending noir, but... absolute 5 stars.",1341705600,,1171,4.634615384615385
