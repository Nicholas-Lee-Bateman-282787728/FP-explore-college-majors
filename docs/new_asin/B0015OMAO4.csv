8259314,5,B0015OMAO4,"Got bored with the elliptical and tried Cardio Combat for a change. WOW! The combinations are hard to follow in the beginning, but like anything else, the more you try it, the easier it becomes. I have been doing this workout 3 times a week for the past month. And just as Kristy promised, I have seen significant changes in my body. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to shake up their fitness routine. Kristy is a thorough, patient, kind instructor. She offers encouragement without ""barking"" orders at you. She reminds you to go at your own pace. I'm very happy I bought this DVD!!!",1331856000,,598,4.546296296296297
8259315,5,B0015OMAO4,The first time I started this video I thought to myself Oh my gosh what the heck! I just spend $20 on this!? After doing to workout I must say. I LOVE this work out video. Yes the video appears to be low budget but the actual work out is great and that is really what counts. I am very happy with this purchase and would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a cardio workout.,1319241600,2,383,3.987012987012987
8259316,5,B0015OMAO4,"you cant be half committed with this workout, get down low every step and punch and kick hard and strong, I watched the fat melt off my stomach. I wasn't even trying to lose stomach fat- it just happened. These workouts are better than turbo kick or other jerky kickboxing, she uses strong solid moves that tone and strengthen and the calories burn like crazy. The bigger floor area you have the better.",1237507200,6,403,4.534246575342466
8259317,5,B0015OMAO4,"I'm doing kickboxing videos for a long time now and I consider myself as an advanced `kickboxer' so it's not simple to find a good challenging kickboxing video (that's not from P90X or P90X+ series).
This workout was challenging enough and a little difficult to follow at first - it has many kickboxing moves that combined together and preformed fast, though Kristy building it up gradually, the final combination is hard to follow... A lot of jumping jacks and vigorous step-touch between the combos so its kind of an interval training as well. This video is more of a cardio workout  - more moving and jumping around than just static punching or kicking.
The entire workout is about an hour including the warm up and the stretching.
Kristy is very pleasant (not annoying) and motivating. The workout accompanied by house music that not too loud and fits very well with the moves. No equipment required.",1231113600,10,904,4.832258064516129
