7871540,5,6304462972,I have used this video presentation for over 12 years with undergraduate science students thinking of health profession careers. Each and every one of them would say this documentary had an impact on their decision process. It was a part of a pre-med advising program that had the objective of eyes-wide-open choices to either continue the path to medical school OR to seek another career path. The medical students are memorable and you can find follow-up thoughts from some of them by searching the internet today.,1289001600,,516,5.011627906976744
7871541,5,6304462972,"I first saw this documentary when I was considering going to medical school. I watched it again when I was in medical school. I watched it a third time when I was an intern. And I just watched it again now that I am in my last year of residency during a night on call with one of my junior residents.
This is a wonderful set of videos.
When I first saw it I had no idea how accurately it portrays the process of medical training. Each time I see it, there are things the individuals state that resonate loud and clear with me. And each time I see it, they get louder and clearer. There are certain universal experiences in our training, and many of them are captured here on film. When I watched the video last month with my junior, she also found it to be a great collection.
I must say, one of the best parts was seeing one of our current (anesthesia) attendings nervously put in his first iv catheter. Of course, the first 3 times I saw the video, I had no idea I would ever meet anyone in it, let alone be instructed by one.
Anyway, suffice it to say this is a masterpiece, and I highly recommend it. Very well done.",1194652800,3,1120,4.1422018348623855
7871542,5,6304462972,"being a student of Clinical Medicine,i recommend this documentary highly to all aspiring medics. i saw this documentary myself in Australia as a child quite by accident and it played a significant role in making my decision to enter the profession.

this documentary is a gritty look at the world of doctors and their training. those who are seeking glamourised versions or ER-type hollywood productions please be aware this is neither. this is a video of promise slyly contained in misery. this video shows you what its really like.

if you think medicine is about money, don't expect to see any doctors driving off in porsches or mercedes. if you think doctors acquire social standing, expect to see miserable faces, disastrous marriages, and a doctor being disrespected by a patient to the point of incontinence. if you think medicine is about swooping in to save the day, expect to see pre-op interviews with lively patients and then find them deceased a moment later. if you think this documentary is going to show you facinating surgical procedures, prepare to see grief-stricken medical students crying in the OT. however those who realistically expect promise from medicine will find that inner peace delicately laced throughout this production.

this is not a horror story but neither is it a fun filled adventure. instead it follows seven medical students from the prestigious Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mass. from their first day to specialisation. it focuses on the problems they need to overcome not on their successes.

what i learned from this documentary is that everything that we consider valuable personally to ourselves can be stripped away and entering a profession like medicine which is geared towards focussing on others, establishes a situation where this is likely to happen. medicine is a gamble but it is more so if you focus primarily on your own life. if what you care about most in this world are that things that matter to you, then you can lose them to the tough world of medicine. however if you what you care about most is the benefit of others then your loss will be compensated by the smiles you see on the faces of those you benefit from your work as a doctor.

if you feel like medicine is the career path for you, please take the time to watch this documentary. it will likely be the most satisfying or terrifying thing you will ever watch. you may realise medicine is not for you and save yourself some pain, or you may realise that you love the field despite being terrified by it and prepare yourself more appropriately for the rigours ahead. either way your development towards the field of medicine will be more profound after watching this documentary than any other medical item on TV.",1142035200,2,2737,4.852248394004283
7871543,5,6304462972,EXCELLENT! This documentary is an incredible view of the real-life sacrifices some people make as they enter the fascinating world of medicine. Anyone considering a career in medicine should see this documentary.,1103155200,2,212,5.65625
7871544,5,6304462972,"This film was not made in 1974 - much more recent - 1992 or 1994 I believe.  As all the reviews say, it is potently real. As a medical educator, I use this film to demonstrate the potential for reformation in the medical education process.  The introduction says it all, ""Follow seven medical students through seven GRUELING (emphasis added) years of medical school and residency - the making of a doctor.""

There is evidence emerging that this form of ""grueling"" education may have some relationship to some of the issues we see in the practice of medicine relative to quality.  Every medical educator should see this at least once.  Particulary powerful is Jay Bonner's segment with his neurology professor.",1102636800,3,709,4.92436974789916
7871545,4,6304462972,"I'd really like to see an updated version of this movie, since the advent of managed care.
Are these people still doctors in 2004?",1071446400,3,130,4.458333333333333
7871546,5,6304462972,"I watched this documentary with my husband, who was considering attending medical school.  Afterwards, even though we'd have lived a life full of large houses, prestige, BMWs, etc, he decided that the status would not be worth the sacrifice.  I quite agree with him.
The video was exceptionally well made, showing how the utter intensity of internship and residency affects the lives of many different kinds of people.  We watched many interviews with the students who were dazed with lack of sleep, divorce, and work weeks exceeding 100 hrs.  Anyone interested in medical school should watch this for an indication of the challenges you will face.",989452800,20,648,5.084905660377358
7871547,5,6304462972,"This video give a spectacular look into the life of a medical student from day one to the end of residency.  It shows not only the tremendous workload that medical students endure, but also the mental breakdown that occurs, which affects many of them not only personally, but also socially as well.  The NOVA people really did a fantastic job on this video.  This really is as realistic as it gets and should leave you with no doubts as to what it will really be like in medical school.",989107200,10,486,4.438202247191011
