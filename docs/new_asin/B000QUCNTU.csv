8197674,5,B000QUCNTU,Well made documentary focusing on perils of journalism during times of war and the lies that got us into Iraq.  Be forewarned - there are graphic photos of burned and mutilated bodies that you will never see in your morning newpaper.  This movie will open your eyes to the horrors of war and force you to reconsider if you are a supporter of the war in Iraq.,1191888000,6,358,4.3283582089552235
