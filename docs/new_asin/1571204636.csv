188137,5,1571204636,I am new to quilting and this video helped me learn a lot of tecniques to make my quilt look better.  I would recommend this video to all quilters advanced and beginners.,1192320000,9,170,4.3125
188138,5,1571204636,"As other reviewers have already noted, this is an outstanding tool for choosing the right sewing tools, learning new techniques, and also for slightly more advanced quilters who want to improve their work. There are many hints from Sally Collins' personal experience that are so valuable, as well as detailed instructions for each step.  It will be a DVD that I will watch over again and use for reference, and because it is divided into chapters, you can go to the specific one you need.  It is 75 minutes long and covers several topics related to patchwork piecing.  It also has a ""quilt gallery"" that allows you to view a variety of pieced quilts. Even though I have taken quilting classes and read books, I found this DVD to be the best and most economical way to learn.  It's inspiring too; Sally Collins leaves you with a feeling of confidence that you really can learn to be more precise.",1326153600,3,895,4.610062893081761
188139,5,1571204636,"Absolutely a must-have for anyone looking to improve their piecing!  I've had it less than a week, and I've already watched it twice.  The tips are easy enough, and there really wasn't much that I had to purchase to be able to try-out her suggestions.",1324425600,2,251,4.555555555555555
188140,4,1571204636,"This is good.  It goes over some basic info
that is real important to doing good work.
It could be better and cover more steps in
the process of making quilts.  It is a little
short.",1316044800,,182,4.027777777777778
188141,5,1571204636,This is an outstanding resource for anyone who is begining to quilt or wants to perfect their piecing skills. Sally give insightful hints on how to make your piecing more precise and easy. It begins with cutting with precision & accurateness. She moves you through step by step in each section of the process. I have shared this publication with a number of my quilting friends. The DVD by the same name is also very useful as one can view Sally as she does precision piecing. I highly recommend this book to assist you in becoming a precise quilter.,1302998400,,550,4.565656565656566
188142,5,1571204636,"Being a bibliophile, I don't usually do DVDs for reference work.  HOWEVER, Sally Collin's DVD on Piecing skills is bar none the best quilting instructional DVD for workmanship that I've seen.  Sally teaches exact and practical skills for beginners and advanced quilters, and even has good solid information for quilters with years of experience.  This is because she teaches from the ground up.  She will teach you exactly how to machine piece so that your chain pieces come correctly on and off the chain thread, so your 1/4 inch seams are done correctly, how to iron to set the seams, how to measure so that the blocks finish up to the correct size, how to determine where you might have gone wrong.  In spite of the many reviewers who say that her books and DVD are not for beginners, I would EMPHATICALLY disagree.  If beginners are given this information early on in their quiltmaking, than they will make fewer mistakes that may cause them to become disheartened or intimidated by piecing a quilt top.

Imagine a puzzle of many pieces where the a bit of each piece is shaved off in many different directions.  The assembled puzzle would look a bit strange, right?  Well sometimes quilts end up that way due to the difficulties of working with fabric and piecing accurately.  Sally has made of study of accuracy due to her love of tiny quilts.  She HAS to be able to get it right in order for her quilts to finish well.

She has been kind enough to pass that mastery of precision piecing on to the rest of us.  There is a great classic carpentry book that has inspired thousands of craftsman of all kinds over the years.  It's title has become an aphorism to craftspeople no matter what material they work in.  Sally's DVD reflects the mindset of that master craftsman, 'Measure twice, cut once'.  In other words, do the small things well, then the large things will come together and stay together.  Do the small things badly, and the large things will never quite fit together correctly.

Sally's DVD is about those small things in quilting, and how to make sure they are done well so that the large thing, the quilt, comes together well in the end.  And, as in her books, she packs in the information.  There is no wasted time here.  And no extraneous info.  The material is presented well and in a very organized manner, and as well, she explains each tip or technique VERY clearly, leaving nothing to chance.  AND, the photography of her working is quite good, allowing you to see the fabric and her hands and the way that she is working.  The only problem in this DVD, is that the production of her gallery of quilts is a bit over the top.  The camera person zooms in to the quilt, and then fades to the next so quickly that it is VERY difficult to pause and see the quilt itself.  If you can get the screen paused in time, then the zoom is just beginning and you are looking at a very blurred, very complex piece of art.  I would have wished for a bit more time to pause and zoom in manually a bit at a time to look at the workmanship.

I agree with the previous reviewer.  There's no WAY I'll loan out this vid, and I'll be watching it several times, I'm sure.  Not because the material is unclear, but because there is so much of it packed in.  Thanks Sally!  This one's great.  I wish you'd make another!!!",1296864000,4,3321,4.454394693200664
188143,5,1571204636,"I am a beginner quilter and I struggle to rotary-cut my fabric strips straight. I figured proper rotary cutting techniques are the key to precision piecing and bought the DVD. I was right. Ms. Collins covers rotary cutting thoroughly. The camera angles make it easy to see what she is doing. I replayed the segment as often as I needed to understand what I saw. Then I applied her techniques and now consistently cut my fabric straight. (Ms. Collins goes on to demonstrate techniques using 1"" pieces that I suppose experienced quilters will appreciate.) To me, an effective DVD is worth 1,000 photos and this one prevented me from giving up on quilting.",1288483200,8,653,4.787610619469026
188144,5,1571204636,"Sally Collins belongs to my quilting guild and I missed her presentation and class. So, I bought this DVD and watched it within 1 week of getting it in the mail. Sally teaches from experience in the same frustrations all quilters have with piecing and communicates in a way that is clear, concise and relatable. Her methodolgies and tips are simple and effective. I considered myself to be a messy quilter. Resigned to having non-perfect blocks no matter how hard I tried. When I applied her methods and tips to my own quilting projects, lo and behold....my blocks came out perfect! Just like the other quilters in my guild...there is hope for me yet! :D

I highly recommend this for anyone, but especially for beginning learners of quilting and sewing.",1280016000,5,753,4.792307692307692
188145,5,1571204636,"For experienced quilters who struggle with precision piecing, for beginners who want to learn correct technique and for anyone who doesn't realize that it IS possible to have seams match most of the time. I quote Sally ""you don't have to do it right every time, only the LAST time.""  The DVD is full of well-presented information, and is a good introduction to her book of the same name. This is an excellent product that should be available in every quilt shop. I doubt that I will ever part with my copy, as I absorb more information every time I watch it (which is usually before I have to piece a quilt - I usually applique).",1270857600,3,629,4.422413793103448
188146,5,1571204636,"I've been piecing quilts for approximately 10 years now and have taken many technique classes.  My bindings are excellent; however, I often struggle to get my pieces to meet and my work product to lie flat.  After watching this video only once I understand exactly what my problems are and how to correct them.  I wish that one of my beginning quilting teachers had taught these simple methods and discussed some of the tools (such as using a non-steam iron) recommended by Sally Collins.  While I also own the book of the same name, I appreciate the demos in the DVD...the old one picture is worth a thousand words is so true.  This DVD is appropriate for beginners to get started on the right path and for experienced quilters who want to improve their work.",1269907200,15,760,4.6
188147,5,1571204636,I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law.  She always had problems piecing quilts. She has used it again and again as a reference!,1243382400,3,134,4.36

7797262,5,1571204636,Sally Collins is a master teacher of precision in quilting.  Her lovely manner invites the reader to engage in the proper methods for making a quilt.  I learned so much from her book and CD that my confidence level has risen dramatically.  I read parts of the book everyday so it sinks into my understanding of what I need to do to execute precision piecing.  Just love this book and CD.,1422230400,,387,4.408450704225352

7797264,5,1571204636,"Sally Collins' tips on cutting, pinning and sewing perfect quarter inch seams are superb. I thought I knew all there was about piecing, cutting, pinning for quilting, but I was wrong. Even simple things like how to hold the rotary cutter made so much sense.",1391299200,,257,4.733333333333333
7797265,5,1571204636,"My quilting group recommended this when I asked for tips on getting better accuracy, and I found it to be a great resource.

Her instruction is relevant to quilters of many different styles who are looking to improve their cutting and stitching accuracy.",1383177600,,379,5.031746031746032
7797266,3,1571204636,I was a little disappointed.  I didn't learn anything that I didn't know already.  She doesn't really give you knowledge on how to do better cutting which is what makes better piecing.,1366156800,,184,4.71875
7797267,5,1571204636,"I saw the video on the Quilt Show and ordered it right away, because I knew I would refer to it many times.

I never understood why almost everything I did never came out correctly...until Sally! She showed how to do everything correctly from step one to the end. The camera's position was perfect. No stopping and rewinding to figure out what she was saying. I got almost all of it the first time. Well worth the money!! I will watch this repeatedly to improve my techniques.",1332806400,2,507,4.644444444444445
