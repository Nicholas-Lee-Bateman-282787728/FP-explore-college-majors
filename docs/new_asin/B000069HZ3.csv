1734707,5,B000069HZ3,"This DVD is my favorite among those released by the current lineup (Mark VII for you purists) for several reasons:  song selection, inspirational performances, and fine picture/sound quality.  I agree with the other reviews -- the band is having a ball and they lay it out there show after show.  Highlights for me include Screaming, Perfect Strangers, and Blindman, where Steve's tone and chops are among the best ever captured on video.  This version of Screaming comes close to the 1999 LSO track, and both will make those small hairs on the back of your neck stand up.  Lazy is a blast -- these guys breathe new life into it, and if your foot is not tapping throughout this song, you have no pulse.  Two gold nuggets -- Hey Cisco and Fools -- were part of the 2001 setlist, and along with Hush, make for a variety not often found on what critics refer to as ""greatest hits"" tours for more seniored bands.  Ian's voice is in great form (often accompanied by Steve's bends for the really really high notes) and he is a superb front-man, knowing when to take control and then give it back to his mates.  Speaking of mates, Roger, Ian and Jon are so consistently brilliant that they carry Purple's distinctive sound through every song, yet blend in their own touches to the delight of the audience.  These five gentlemen are arguably among the best musicians at their respective positions, and as fans we can only hope for more Perihelion's in the future.  Eeeeeeeeeyowwwwwwww!",1031961600,2,1477,4.689922480620155
1734708,5,B000069HZ3,"This last tour of Deep Purple will be remembered as organist Jon Lord's last. This DVD and tour was better than the one in 1998. Ian Gillan's voice seems well rested and less raspy than on the last concert release. The band plays a Greatest Hits set with a few fun things thrown in like ""Mary Long"" and ""No One Came."" What you see is a close knit group of friends making the music they love. Guitarist Steve Morse is a perfect fit and has been with the band almost 8 years. It is too bad nothing from the last studio album ABANDON was included, but all in all fine fare!
Jon Lord has left the band to be replaced by Don Airey. We shall miss the master of the Hammond. I saw this tour when it came to Minneapolis, and they were a very hot band. Excellent sound quality on this DVD and good video production. Buy it.",1030579200,14,814,4.1257861635220126
1734709,5,B000069HZ3,"I, too, am a long-time Purple fan and I agree with Mr T.  There is a nice mix of old songs and new songs; including rock, ballads and even jazz.  Steve Morse obviously fits well with the band.  His work on Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming, Fools and Perfect Strangers is phenominal.  No One Came is an excellent studio song that just doesn't translate well to a live performance, but Perfect Strangers is more than worth the price of the DVD alone.  Overall it is an excellent performance by true masters.  It will be enjoyed by rock fans everywhere.",1029974400,5,549,4.494949494949495
1734710,4,B000069HZ3,"I've been following the band since their 1970's ""In Rock"" album, which I still consider to be their best-ever album; and I own all of their ""official"" CDs (including those 2 of the pre-Gillan era), and DVDs as well.
Ian (Gillan) was still a much much better singer than almost all of the other rock bands; but in this DVD, you have to admit that everybody has a time, and Ian is of no exception (he was already 56 in this DVD) that you can easily tell the difference from his prime.  Another thing about this DVD is that the recording is not as good as all other Purple's DVDs.
Having said the above, other band members are still playing great--including Steve Morse, whom you can hardly find among other bands such an excellent replacement, especially when you know that he's replacing a great (and cool) guitarist--Mr Ritchie Blackmore.
At this price, this DVD is no doubt a good buy; but the best buy is the 1993's ""Come Hell or High Water"" when the MKII line up played their last concerts.",1029369600,,993,4.486187845303867
1734711,5,B000069HZ3,"As a purple fan for many years I was interested in finding out what one of the original ""monsters of rock"" bands were up to lately. While signs of age are clearly present there is still a confidence and professioal swagger that exists within the very core of this band. The sound and picture quailty is exceptional and the program selection which mixes classic purple with new material holds up throughout the entire show. Guitarist Steve Morse is like a shot of adreneline and he looks like a kid in a candy store playing these classic tunes. The added comentaries are revealing and it is apparent that Blackmore's leaving was not met with any tears. A five star performance from one of the originals.",1029283200,10,702,4.669354838709677
1734752,5,B000069HZ3,Enjoyed a tasty musical video.  Steve Morse is great! As a guitar player he was one of my favorites.  Always a Deep Purple fan but had no idea just how good they are.  Bought some 1970's DVD's also.  I don't buy many music DVD's but this was a treat. Jerry.,1153785600,2,257,4.08
1734753,5,B000069HZ3,"Deep Purple have always been the kings of hard rock, and in this DVD, they shine as much, if not more than they ever have before.  First, the set list is great.  I love seeing songs like No One Came, When A Blind Man Cries, and Fools make it in this concert.

Ian Gillan- Best hard rock singer of all time, and even though his voice is obviously not like it used to be, he makes it work, and sounds exceptionally great in Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming.

Steve Morse- This guy is a guitar God.  Probably the best in the world right now, and his chemistry with the band shows in this concert.  Two of the best solos I have EVER seen are Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming and When A Blind Man Cries.  Absolutely amazing.

Roger Glover-  This guy keeps the band together, and always plays great basslines.  Also his bass solo in Speed King is MUCH better than any bass solo I've ever heard of his.  Great playing, and a really good tone he has too.

Ian Paice-  Holy lord.  The only member of Deep Purple who has stuck with them for every lineup.  And he has NOT lost his touch.  Great drumming through the whole concert, and the solo in Speed King is incredible.  Gotta love the one handed drum roll.

Jon Lord-  Master of the hammond organ, and he is great on this dvd.  My personal favorite moment is in Speed King, where he and Steve Morse switch off solos.  Absolutely great keyboard playing.

Favorite Songs:

Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming

Fools

When A Blind Man Cries

Speed King

Those 4 songs are some of the best performances I've ever seen of Deep Purple.",1150156800,4,1566,4.328719723183391
1734754,5,B000069HZ3,"I'm huge fan of Deep Purple and this is my first DP DVD and it is really great  here is the content of the DVD:

The concert  is 1.425 minutes  here is the track list:

1-Woman from Tokyo (7.06 minutes)

2-Ted the Mechanic (4.53 minutes)

3-Mary Long (6.34 minutes)

4-Lazy (7.00 minutes)

5-No One Came (5.13 minutes)

6-Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming (10.12 minutes)

7-Fools (9.07 minutes)

8-Perfect Strangers (9.15 minutes)

9-Hey Cisco (5.03 minutes)

10-When a Blind Man Cries (7.19 minutes)

11-Smoke on the Water (6.35 minutes)

12-Speed King (15.51 minutes)

13-Hush (3.19 minutes)

14-Highway Star (9.55 minutes)

and there is 30 minutes of very interesting interviews with the band

the performance is a brilliant and most of these songs are better here than the album versions for example (long Mary) had never attracted my attention but here it is really cool song and it is one of my favorites....

The new version of (fools) is very impressive because Jon lord added new sounds with his Keyboards and Morse plays new guitar solos so you find it very different from the 1971 version ...here it is longer and better

The 15 minutes (speed king ) is the best performance on this DVD because Morse and Lord play  incredible  solos then Roger plays Bass solo then Ian Paice plays Drums solo then Gillan perform another short song while morse plays Guitar then the continue Speed King....they are amazing

So this is a must buy DVD and you won't be disappointed at all. Actually any one who loves Hard Rock and Blues will love this DVD",1122854400,14,1546,4.743396226415094
1734755,5,B000069HZ3,"Who is Deep Purple? Is it Deep Purple if Ritchie Blackmore is not involved? This question is constantly being asked when mentioning or reviewing this band. Blackmore will always be associated with the history of this band. But, then again, So will David Coverdale, Glenn Hughes and Tommy Bolin. What I'm saying is that Deep Purple was always 5 very talented musicians working together and making music. It's a collaborative effort. Blackmore left and decided that collaborating was only doing his songs and no one else. So, The band got Steve Morse to play guitar. I met Steve Morse in 1993 at an after show Dixie Dregs meet and greet. I told him that admired his column in Guitar magazine called ""Open Ears"". He said to me if I ever had any suggestions for the column to let him know because he had a tedency to run out of ideas. ""Excuse me! Steve Morse wants ideas from me?""
So, as I watch this DVD, I see 5 musicians working together and getting the buzz from working off the other musicians(as they tell us in the additional stuff). Did we ever see Ian Gillan stand that close to Ritchie Blackmore? Did we ever see smiles on those faces so big?
Yes, Gillan's voice is a little weak at times. But, as the show continues, it seems to get stronger and it sounds like and looks like a relaxed vocalist singing at his peak. Steve Morse is a phenomenal guitar player. He's a rare guitarist. With him, Talent doesn't equal ego. Because his talent is immense and huge. Thank God his ego isn't. I never thought too much about Roger Glover's bass playing until now and realize he can lay it down and improvise with the best. Jon Lord is and will always be the master of the Hammond Organ. Just listen to any recording he's ever done of ""Lazy"" and you'll know why. And of course, the bedrock of Deep Purple...the left handed drum wizard-Ian Paice. His drum solo caught my attention, my wife's attention and my one-year old son's attention. This man's incredible one handed drum roll sent me to my basement to try and figure that out for myself.

Song selection...
some have said in their reviews that the songs were a little weak. I personally thought it was a nice change for the band and for fans alike. There are obvious songs that are expected. Smoke on the Water and Speed King are two of them. But after listening to Made in Japan and Nobody's Perfect (over and over)it was nice to hear some other songs from the classic era. When they went into Mary Long(from Who do We Think We Are)and Fools and No One Came (from Fireball), I almost thought they were from the Steve Morse era albums. But I was relieved to find out that they were great old songs that they were dusting off for a younger audience. I even dug out my old vinyl copy of Fireball to have a listen. The Morse era numbers just rock with power and aggression that Blackmore lacked in the past few years. I had forgotten what great songs Ted the Mechanic, Sometimes I feel Like Screaming and especially Hey Cisco were.
These 5 guys obviously love making music together. You can tell in the performance and that's what makes a great concert from a great band.",1122336000,5,3118,4.470175438596491
1734756,3,B000069HZ3,"I've seen Deep Purple (in this incarnation) live 3 times. Whoever said Ian Gillan isn't getting any younger is right. He looks RIDICULOUS on stage in his khaki-cotton beach wear. Grandpa Gillan used to be the king of rock singers, but even Kings must abdicate the throne.

As for Steve Morse, the man is God.

I give this 3 stars...I'd give it 5, but I take 1 star off for Ian Gillan looking like a dork, and another star missing for the song selection which is a bit weak.",1110672000,5,473,4.303370786516854
1734757,5,B000069HZ3,"I recently got into Deep Purple in the last month or so. My 1st exposure was the ""Come Hell or High Water"" DVD. I checked it out because I'm a DIO and Rainbow fan and Richie Blackmore came from Deep Purple. After watching "" Come Hell or High Water"" I realized that the other 4 members made the band and hooked me on Deep Purple. Blackmore was a prick. You can tell he wasn't into it and just went through the motions. So I bought a few CDs and got more hooked, then I bought this DVD. Steve Morse makes them a 5 piece !!!! You feel the chemistry all 5 have together. awsome DVD , awsome music. I just wish they could've hooked up with Morse earlier.",1094601600,2,649,4.078125
1734758,5,B000069HZ3,"It's too bad some fans don't consider Deep Purple really Deep Purple without Ritchie Blackmore? In my opinion Deep Purple can still lay it down even without Ritchie Blackmore on guitar. Even though Ian Gillan doesn't have the pipes or vocal range he once had, he can still rock. Gillan's not getting any younger and while he struggles to hit some of the high notes that once made him famous, overall he does a very good job.

Guitarist Steve Morse brings his own flare and style of guitar playing to Deep Purple and in my opinion he does a fantastic job. I have to admit on a few song's I found myself saying Ritchie who? after hearing Steve Morse play. What more can you say about the amazing John lord, he is the king of the keyboards and his performance on ""Perihelion"" is fantastic to say the least. Roger Glover doesn't really stand out in this concert, but he does his job very well as usual. Now on to the dynamic Ian Paice, he really is the glue that holds the band together. Ian Paice is a great drummer and his solo is but a small glimpse of what he can do.

Overall Deep Purple ""Perihelion"" is an enjoyable concert DVD with a nice clear picture and great sound. Hearing Deep Purple play ""Perfect Strangers"" was worth the price of this DVD for me.

1734759,5,B000069HZ3,"Isn't it true... wasn't watching this concert more enjoyable than about any other time you might have seen Deep Purple?  Let's face it, though one helluva guitar player, Ritchie Blackmore is, in my opinion, the Ty Cobb Of Rock n Roll ~ Had the chops, but not the most mild mannered individual in the world.  I thought Steve Morse just did an OUTSTANDING job playing the purple leads.  And, unlike Ritchie, smiles and entertains with seeming ease.  I was also turned on to some new old stuff I either hadn't heard or hadn't heard in a while.  ""Ted The Mechanic"" is just a great tune with a great story.  Love their jamming on ""Mary Long"" (of whom I actually know one).  Tons of tunes and all One show, without a bunch of stupid editing... I love the way it was done.  (The old rockers still know how to film better stuff).  If you've EVER liked Deep Purple, this is a DVD you will NOT be dissapointed with.",1092268800,6,905,4.37125748502994
1734760,4,B000069HZ3,I listened to this band when I was in high school 30 years ago. Amazing they are still around. The good songs back then are still played well. This one is a keeper. It has the hits from the 70's plus some others I was not familiar with.,1085875200,,236,3.9375
1734761,3,B000069HZ3,"This dvd is not what any Deep Purple fan should call great.  The band plays fairly well but Ian Gillan needs to contemplate retirement.  His performance here pales in comparison to his earlier dominance of rock frontmen.  It's obvious he realizes it as he appears uncomfortable while struggling to hit his mark throughout the concert.  Perhaps the boys should look for a younger frontman who has the pipes to lead this band.  Steve Morse does ok replacing Blackmore but just ok.  One bright star is John Lord who, to my knowledge, has since retired...too bad because he can still do his part.  Overall sound is pretty good but video is weak by today's standards.",1081728000,4,662,4.754385964912281
1734811,4,B000069HZ3,"I saw Deep Purple live only once, That was in 1973. On the same bill was ELO. Absolutely the greatest rock concert I have seen. Well, Led Zepplin and Pink Floyd were up there too.
My ears were buzzing and deaf after listening to, at that time,
the loudest rock band in the world. Richie Blackmore's guitar was deafening. Ian Gillian was difficult to hear......
Anyway, back to this DVD.
Have to agree with another reviewer.....Steve Morse is the saviour of this band. His energy and musicianship help along the older guys to get their maximum efforts out. And lets be clear, Purple band members are in their 50's (John Lord, now departed and ""retired"" is 60 something). Steve's guitar craft is excellent and makes me not even pine for Richie Blackmore (who is, BTW, a lost cause).
Gillian still has the voice, however he can't get the high notes that made him famous. Glover and Paice are satisfactory but certainly don't shine. The elder statesman, John Lord, was bang on with his keyboard playing. Where do you see and hear a Hammond organ with a rotating Leslie these days?
Lord, in the extras interviews, summed up the demise of classic rock by saying that they (Purple) were part of a time in history that young people today will never experience. This saddened him greatly. I agree.
To sum up, this is a good DVD, worth it to the Purple fan.
Cheers!",1070582400,,1355,4.603305785123967

1734813,4,B000069HZ3,"I've seen these guys live three times - 1984, 1986, and 1998. This DVD was almost as good as the real shows. The only missing element is Ian Gillian's voice - he can't hit those high notes anymore, and his lung power is very obviously fading. Despite all that, he has a rollicking good time, as does Steve Morse. The sound quality (DTS 5.1) cannot compare to the best I've heard (Eagles - Hell Freezes Over), but still, it's well engineered to suit Purple's genre of music - slightly muted highs and a great thumping bass line. ""Perfect Strangers"", ""Lazy"" and ""Space Truckin"" are the highlights. Also nice to hear an old favourite ""Mary Long"". But ""Woman From Tokyo"" was disappointing - the studio cut was better. The bass and drum solos on ""Speed King"" are simply out of this world - as good or better than the great Lord/Blackmore jam on ""Strange Kind Of Woman"" from the ""Made In Japan"" album.
Overall, highly recommended and a must have for any true rock fan.",1061424000,4,962,4.5344827586206895

Blackmores playing whilst once an absolute genius had gone to pot in the past few yrs of his playing with purple.  Morse fits in perfectly, he is an awesome player and does not try to change any of the classics but adds his influence to the new stuff.  Highway star, lazy and hush are still classics.  Fools has been the highlight for me on both New live and rare and this DVD.
My one complaint.......  On the extra they give interviews with all the band members and they talk about a concert they did with Pavarotti.  I was expecting to see clips from it at the end of the chatting... but Nothing, nada.... why not!!!",1050624000,2,729,4.2773722627737225

Steve Morse is a change from Ritchie Blackmore for me, but seems to fit in rather well. Jon Lord, Ian Paice, Roger Glover, and Ian Gillian are all going strong and played with abandon.

Big difference on their physical features, but a big experience and the same great music also. All members perform this show greatly: Ian Gillan, Roger Glover, Ian Paice, and the always amazing Keyboardist John Lord, performing with the same power of thirty years ago. Steve Morse, although a new member of the band was entirely in harmony with other members.

Ian Gillan can't hit those really super high notes with his voice like he did back in the early '70's, but still can give you that signature Deep Purple Voice sound...and he sounded great.
He was all over the stage in his bare feet, interacting with the rest of the band and the audience...and one could see and tell they were all having a great time and lots of fun.
These guys still know how to put on a really great live show, the music was crisp and clean....really tight with tons of energy. For any Deep Purple fans out there, I highly recommend this video, you will not be disappointed.",1516406400,,900,4.427710843373494

I finally pulled this video out to enjoy again on my newer, much larger TV and have to admit it's still one of my most remembered shows. My seats were located directly under the boom camera used for Steve Morse close-ups which worked out very nice for me. I had always liked Steve Morse but you must see him live to really appreciate his incredible guitar work as evident in this well recorded concert. As talented as the original band members were, it's obvious that Steve Morse keeps the band's energy level quite high and he's on fire this night. There isn't much I can say that hasn't already been repeated in previous reviews I've read here. Of course I may be partial but if you enjoy this lineup as much as I do, you must have this DVD.

The concert is presented uninterrupted, start to finish plus encore, with some interesting and insightful band interview extras accessible separately.  PERIHELION: ""the point in the orbit of a planet or comet at which it is nearest to the sun.""

After the above synopsis, let me volunteer that I'm NOT a Deep Purple fanatic.  However as a fully fledged ""boomer"" born 1957, I was completely immersed as a rock fan during Purple's peak years, '72-75 and first came to know them well through the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purple-Passages/dp/B000M08VQS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purple Passages</a>&nbsp;Warner Bros. compilation issued at that time recycling much of the best of their Rod Evans years (for their first four albums, Rod was the original lead singer).  I LIKED Rod, and certainly had great respect for the talent of (guitarist) Ritchie Blackmore and (organist) Jon Lord.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Machine-Head/dp/B000002KHB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Machine Head</a>&nbsp;was also VERY well known to me ""back in the day"" and lead track ""Highway Star"" is surely as much of a ""Rock Classic"" as ""Baba O'Reilly"" or ""Money"" by Pink Floyd.  Even so, I found that most of the other ""Mark II"" Purple albums (""Fireball"", ""In Rock"", ""Stormbringer"") somehow just didn't do it for me like ""Machine Head"" did (and does).  Maybe I should give these another listen.

I kept up with DP through the '80's as they reformed the ""Mark II"" line-up and released several uneven releases, including the unusual&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slaves-and-Masters-The-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B00AG471IE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slaves and Masters: The Deluxe Edition</a>&nbsp;featuring Ritchie's Rainbow vocalist Joe Lynn Turner temporarily stepping up to the DP microphone (an OUTSTANDING singer, in my opinion).  THEN like a thunderclap, around 1990 or so, Blackmore was out and STEVE MORSE of all people was IN as the new DP guitarist.  Steve was already well known to me, going all the way back to his band Dixie Dregs' first release on Capricorn Records, circa 1976-77,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Free-Fall/dp/B000009D68/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Free Fall</a>.  Steve's amazing talent as a guitarist was justly renowned, but having him step in to Blackmore's place in Purple was an ASTONISHING left-field shock!  Nevertheless, I was more than curious to hear what the new band sounded like, and was glad to give unhesitating thumbs-up to their first release&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Purpendicular/dp/B000024KRO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Purpendicular</a>&nbsp;in the early 90's.  New releases have followed irregularly and are equally worthy in concept & execution; these guys are PROS and even though they're kind of boxed in by their well-established ""style"", you can ALWAYS be sure they'll ""do what they do"" reliably and with the dazzling skill & polish we've come to expect.

SO, steeped in all this personal history, I was willing to drop $10 and give ""Perihelion"" a spin, mostly to sample the Morse-era band onstage, since it's unlikely I'll have the opportunity to see them live.  In a word: OUTSTANDING.  Despite their seniority, these guys rock with venomous ferocity and tear through their now extensive body of work with stunning authority.  Best of all, they are clearly LOVING performing together and for the audience; their enthusiasm is infectious not only for the crowd on hand but equally for DVD viewers years or decades later.  The band on stage here, especially given all their troubled history and tribulations, exudes JOY for having passed through those fires and emerging to exalt in their moment onstage, doing what they do best.  You would truly have to be a sneering troll to not be inspired by their energy and passion.

Great personal credit to ALL these musicians who have kept their edge and perfected their skills over decades of striving.  Most of us (Shermatz included) give up on music as real life obliges us to ""get serious"" and do things we don't care about for people who don't like us to earn our daily bread (life isn't really all THAT bad, but you know what I mean).  INSPIRING is a word I'll use again for the example Purple's performance here arouses, and elevates this package beyond its musical merits (which are abundant).  Without slagging the rest of the band, I certainly want to give special recognition to Steve whose participation restabilized and made Purple viable again after spending WAY too long trying to patch things over with the amazing (but impossibly temperamental) Blackmore.  Those who won't accept Purple without Blackmore should ask whether they'd have preferred that the band just break up.  ""Perihelion"" demonstrates, certainly to my satisfaction, that Steve's presence reinvigorated the band and has been GOOD for all parties, certainly including open-minded fans like myself (admittedly an admirer of Steve prior to his Purple association).

Ian Gillan: what's up with going barefoot on stage?  Has he ALWAYS done that?  That raised my eyebrows.  Probably not safe, but I suppose by now he knows what he's doing.  Allow me a sentence or two to commemorate the ENORMOUS talent of Jon Lord, who was apparently on his last tour with Purple here (Jon left the band, probably due to health, replaced by the more-than-competent Don Airey).  Seeing Jon tear it up live really reminded me again what a huge, HUGE talent he was.  He gets overlooked because so many contemporaries were bigger egos and public personas--Keith Emerson, Rick Wakeman are the first that come to mind.  AND let's concede that Purple's hard-rock tilt certainly favored guitarists more than organists.  But try to imagine a Purple record WITHOUT Jon.  RIP--Jon died 2012, and we can only say we were all better for sharing his musical legacy.

I wholeheartedly and without reservation RECOMMEND ""Perihelion"" to not just Purple fans, but to ANY ""classic rock"" fan interested in a midlife shot of adrenaline that this disc provides in generous dosage.  I'm not going the full five stars here only because I'm just not completely on board with all the tracks on the playlist; these were NEVER huge personal favorites of mine, though I hasten to add, they are performed with flawless virtuosity and panache.  The band interview extras are VERY interesting and insightful, especially Jon & Steve's remarks about rock music and their mutual experience with the band and life in general.  Altogether, there is a great deal more than a blazing rock concert to appreciate and relive here.  WELL worth seeing at least once if not purchasing--and I'm very glad to own it to sample over & over.  Purple Rules (flick the Bic and hold it high!  Flash the Satan horns)!!!",1363996800,,7173,5.572350230414747

7965822,5,B000069HZ3,"I used to be a huge Deep Purple fan. I was deeply disappointed when Blackmore left, I couldn't even imagine DP without him. So, for a long long time I just listened to their old repertoire. One day, on Netflix, I see this Perihelion. I look at the date, eh....long after Ritchie.....but it was one of those days when the boredom was almost physically hurting me. I know how to watch stuff through Netflix via my PC, so I clicked....okay....let's watch the first few minutes. Who is that gray haired guy behind the keyboard. What.....is that Jon Lord? Oh my God.....and that guy who grabs the microphone? No, it can't be Gillan, but it is Gillan. And comes the first song. Then the second. Blackmore is not there, but that other guy (Steve Morse) plays some fantastic guitar. No, it isn't Blackmore's style, but his style (Morse) while different, is totally fantastic. And while Lord no longer has that ""visual fever"" he used to play with, but the sound coming out of the setup is just the same. The biggest surprise was Gillan. He used to be the only ""semi-sore"" point in my eye (ears), because he never had that ""raspy rock voice"" I like so much. Yet, what I am hearing is different. A much more pleasant, stage act on his side, and I could swear that his voice became better. Is this an illusion? I don't know. Perhaps Ian Pace was the only one who not only grew older, but his drumming wasn't what it used to be. It was still excellent, definitely satisfactory, but he may have lost wee bit of edge.

And it all started to sort of ""fall together"". Not only I like what I am hearing, I may even like better that what I used to like so much. Let me make the long story short. Perihelion is a must see/hear for every hard core Deep Purple fan. When the DVD (Netflix show) ended, I was just sitting there with a total awe. Perihelion is a musical pearl. Of course I bought it for my music DVD collection.

One more remark for the Ritchie Blackmore fans. Technically speaking he was of course fantastic. But if I have to compare his presentation on the Hell or High Water album (again, technically perfect, but totally heartless) with Steve Morse's presentation on Perihelion, Steve won the ""competition"" with knockout.

What I really like about this DVD is the way the band was filmed. We see the band playing and enjoying themselves, and no stupid shots of gormless morons singing along in the audience!
Very enjoyable show - And this gormless moron was singing along at home - But that's OK :)",1218758400,,388,4.0519480519480515

First goes to ""Australia '99"", second would be ""Montreaux '96"", and in third place I stick ""Come Hell or High Water"" because I have no respect for the way Blackmore presented himself. I felt the quality with Perihelion could have been much better and I felt it had a CHEAP feel to it compared to the '99 concert. Smaller stage, smaller audience, no frills and a shorter line-up of tunes. Still it was a joy to experience and I recommend it but I set the bar pretty high after their better shows. I will say I put Perihelion above their ""Archive Collection"" and ""New, Live and Rare"" which are great DVD's as well, just not high in the 'blow you away' scale.",1175126400,,716,4.390977443609023
