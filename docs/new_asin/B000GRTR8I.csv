8133972,5,B000GRTR8I,Although gaurenteed to offend you in one way or another that may be why this film is so entertaining.  The creator's spare no one as they jump from spoof to spoof.  Targeting everything from army recrutment campagnes to men's cologne ads to overzealous patriotic country music stars.  Of course they add in the perfect mix of practical jokes but a deeper look at this little film reveals surprisingly intellectual themes that may just be worth examining.,1195430400,,454,4.947368421052632
8133973,4,B000GRTR8I,Sprung from the minds of pure deviants this is one of the most twisted videos in my collecting to date. It is full of perverse acts of every nature. I loved it! Watch it with the kids. Great for the whole family. Grandma will love it as a stocking stuffer.,1174262400,3,256,4.14

8133976,5,B000GRTR8I,"I am so underground that I have this crap already on bootleg BETA.  That makes me cooler than anyone.  I knew daybyday when they were just minutebyminute.  I am downloading the third installment onto my Ipud as you read this.  When that finishes I'll truely be the King of Hip, and everyone will sweat me! but not as much as they'll sweat this movie.  Buy this crap-support the arts-support the obscene.",1155340800,4,403,4.619718309859155
