MTV sucks for not being honest about the editing of series finale.....shame on them!  >: (",1370390400,,253,4.142857142857143

8532414,2,B008Y7P2MW,"I'm so disappointed that the DVDs have cut the final Teen Mom episode short. MTV/Teen Mom have a huge problem with this issue. Whenever an episode of Teen Mom or Teen Mom 2 runs more than the standard one hour (as seen on TV, about 40 minutes without commercials) the DVDs do not include the full length of that episode. This final episode ""Wake Up"" was a 90 minute long episode, but the DVD only includes the first 2/3rd's or so of it. This has happened with both Teen Mom and Teen Mom 2 in the past, for instance, in the episode from Teen Mom 2 where Leah and Corey marry the DVD is incomplete, cutting off their wedding. Disappointed this continues to happen again and again.",1353110400,2,678,4.346456692913386
