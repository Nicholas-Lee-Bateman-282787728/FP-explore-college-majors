It shows in all it's gory glory, the messy politics, strange bedfellows, community taking charge of itself, and more.  If it were just a few minutes shorter, it would fit better into the 50 minute class time frame, but this movie does a good job of showing how difficult community redevelopment is and how rewarding it can be.",1505174400,,392,4.75

 It is a rarity to find people of different ethnic groups unite to overcome economic disparity. This gem of a rarity was found on Dudley Street, in Boston's neighborhood of Roxbury. A community that was struck with severe economic and social disadvantages, is seen working together to achieve a unanimous goal: to prosper not only economically but culturally as well. The documentary Holding Ground: The Rebirth of Dudley Street(1996) interviews the people that know best what went on in the community, the residents themselves. Filmed in 1996, it highlighted about 10 years back from the commencement of the unity to the day when the first key was handed to its homeowner. Opinions, facts, and stories bring to life the tale of the once repressed neighborhood that was able to rise again.
 The documentary opens with a quote from a Roxbury community member, ""People's only crime here is that they were poor, powerless and had no advocate. That was changing now"" (Lipman). This sums up the entirety of the film. What started off as a working class neighborhood, full of mostly Irish and Italian American residents, turned into what was seen as ""the ghetto"" (Lipman). The European immigrants resided in an area that could be seen as an ethnic enclave, where they all coexisted for similar reasons, that being the close proximity of factories that had the demand for labor. A change started to occur in the 1940s as the factories left the community, leaving many without a job and forcing others to leave the neighborhood in hopes of finding employment elsewhere (Lipman). Programs were put together by politicians to help people get away from the inner city, programs that were not necessarily in favor of minorities, particularly African Americans. Unfortunately, this was a pattern not exclusive to the Roxbury neighborhood as many of the country still held on to prejudice views.
 The real destruction of Dudley Street and the surrounding neighborhood came about through the abandonment of homes. This abandonment left many vacant homes free to demolition, and that is exactly what happened. When homeowners realized they were not going to make a profit from the home, they burned down the building. This frightened many community members, as they would wake up in the middle of the night and see flames and smoke engulf their entire block. This tactic hurt the community as a whole; vacant lots became a frequent site throughout the neighborhood, In the locations where houses no longer stood, illegal dumping was occurring. The lots were filled with trash, thus lowering the desirability to live in the neighborhood. Eventually the town had enough, and the committee was created.
 The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative became the voice of the community. The members of the board were elected by the community and reflected every ethnic group as they were each represented by two board members. Roxbury was a melting pot of different ethnic groups, mostly consisting of Hispanics, African Americans and Cape Verdeans. A woman by the name of Che Madyun was the first elected to the board; early on, even before the conception of the board, she made her voice heard in the name of change. The first things that needed to be addressed included: urban renewal, eminent domain, and gentrification. One of the first movements was called the Don't Dump On Us Campaign, it aided in cleaning up the community.  Cleaning up was not enough to revive the community, it needed a comprehensive plan, one that would take Roxbury to the next level. The Dudley Street Neighborhood Initiative developed a plan, with the help of their own planners and developers, that was adopted by the city. The DSNI then went on to try a bold move, they asked for the permission and power of eminent domain. Now, eminent domain is the right for the government to take property and use it for public purposes in exchange for compensation for the private land owners (Levy 72). That permission had never before been given to committees outside of the government. After a great deal of convincing, it was granted to the board. They in turn, used the power to buy up the land in order to build affordable housing. The process to rebuilding was not easy as funds needed to be raised and developers needed to be hired. It was 10 years after the project was initiated that the first set of keys to the new homes was given out. The film ends with Che Madyun, the first board member explaining how the change was brought about, ""It's the people part of it, the part that has people investing themselves to make a difference, to make a change, and to see that hope, that's the challenge"" (Lipman).
 Holding Ground addresses, not only the general story of the uplifting of the community, but also goes more into depth on the journey and process it took to get there. Urban planning issues such as eminent domain and gentrification are shown and handled. As a committee made up of people from the community, they were able to achieve things at the same level as educated planners and developers. This brought on hope not only for the residents of Roxbury but for people in other towns going though the same hardship. The economic development of Dudley Street started with the coming together of concerned and driven citizens that turned into a community of educated and respected people not only amongst the town but also by the people in higher up positions.
