3857870,1,B00272LJXG,I like Whitney very much but on The Hills. The City is just boring!! Whitney isn't the type to hold her own show. She is more of a supporting cast member.,1244160000,5,154,4.0
3857871,2,B00272LJXG,"As you may have heard Whitney Port one of the former stars of the hugely popular mtv drama-lala-not-so reality land has her own shown The city- which is supposed to be all about an all American LA girl coming to work for Diane von Furstenberg in public relations on the East Coast , NY! Well its also supposed to be reality, but hey what can be really be said of this show, ok well its just bad like not even its so bad its good, but just bad. Whitney's only friend stares blankly at the screen and while sleeping with two different men is genuinley surprised when both dump her, Whitney struggles with her own ""realationship"" with a musician who  OBVIOUSLY  is cheating on her during the whole measley 13 episodes. Whitney keeps denying this, until her bf Jay actually tells her that she is not important enough to stay with while he goes on tour with his band. Theres also mindless models, more cheating and just flashes of obvious cuthroat frenemies, as well as a veryyy tiny glimpse into the fashion world. The show is obviously scripted and staged ( when else will your boss come up to you at her own gala and give you advice on your lovelife?, as Diane herself does with Whitney), but whats worse, while The Hills was always fun to watch b/c the stories and gossip was fun and juicy, this staged crap is frivilous and absolutley no fun at all, because the unreality of this ""reality"" show is blatant! The City gets two stars, only because the soundtrack is halfway decent, do yourself a favor and buy the Hills, or Anything else instead!",1243382400,4,1543,4.487544483985765

8353863,5,B00272LJXG,"What I loved about Whitney during her time on the hills was her quiet ways of being the calm sensible girl who told Lauren to think about her choices....in this series I got to see the other side. All of her drama and her issues and her fights...and I loved it cause Whitney doesn't play.
She is a wonderful designer and she rocks it where ever she is!",1431993600,,352,4.1911764705882355
8353864,4,B00272LJXG,"Just finished watching season 1 of the City. It's interesting enough to keep watching. Whitney can hold her own on this show. She was cool as well on the Hills. Erin and Joe at Elle Mag are fun to watch. I wish I could watch season 2, but I can't seem to find it here on Amazon. Only season 1. Oh well. I would recommend it to anyone interested in fashion and Elle magazine.",1425945600,,374,4.0675675675675675
8353865,3,B00272LJXG,"not the best mtv series but, still filled with drama.
It's mainly about boys cheating and fashion chaos and drama.",1389571200,,114,4.75
8353866,3,B00272LJXG,"When ""The Hills"" began to lose its popularity, MTV decided to spin off a popular ""character"" (Lauren Conrad's BFF, Whitney Port) into her own dramality. This first half of its inaugural season was cool but never lived up to the excitement and intrigue of its west coast counterpart parent series. Honestly, I only stuck around due to a the Manhattan backdrop and the surprise guest appearance of Lauren Conrad herself. Other ""The Hills"" purists may find this series entertaining but, in my opinion, it never surpassed the original.",1359504000,,531,5.045454545454546
8353867,5,B00272LJXG,"Similar to The Hills, only following Whitney Port in her fashion career! If you love The Hills, you'll love this!",1271808000,2,113,4.7
8353868,5,B00272LJXG,thsis is a grat show i love watching it on mtv. I am gald amazon is putting out on dvd since it looks like no stuido will.,1259712000,,122,3.5555555555555554
8353869,5,B00272LJXG,"as like the hills, it is fast moving and keeps your attention, well worth having in the collection...!",1257292800,,102,4.722222222222222
8353870,4,B00272LJXG,"I can't believe all of the negative reviews that this show is getting. If you LOVE the Hills, you'll be sure to LOVE the City!!!! Whitney is soo awesome, and I've always loved her, and now she has her own show!!!! YAYYY Whitney!!!!! You guys will LOVE this show, seriously.",1249084800,3,273,4.48
8353871,4,B00272LJXG,"I love how people knock the show but know exactly what happened in every episode. If you didn't like it: stop watching! I thought it was entertaining, scripted or not, and if you didn't then turn the channel.",1246406400,3,208,4.5
