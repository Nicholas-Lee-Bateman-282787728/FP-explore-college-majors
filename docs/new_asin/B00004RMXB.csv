7921408,5,B00004RMXB,"I saw a single episode of ""Es Muss Nicht Immer Kaviar Sein"" (""It Doesn't Always Have to be Kaviar"") on TV while traveling in Germany long long ago.  I was captivated enough to acquire the book, and found it to be spell-binding.  I'd love to see the entire film or serialization, but would need to have it in a format playable on my US equipment.

The plot concerns a man who is coerced into becoming a spy for Nazi Germany and his efforts to minimize the damage that he is compelled to do.  In the episode that I saw, he escapes from a Portugese prison by forging release papers for his cellmate, then impersonating his cellmate.  When the authorities realize that they have released the wrong man, they release the cellmate (still on the forged papers).  But now the bad guys are looking for someone who matches the cellmate's description . . .

(The title derives from the fact that many chapters begin with a recipe and a note such as, ""Over this meal, so-and-so told me such-and-such"".)
