8000144,1,B0000D90AG,The Boxed set of the Best of the Muppets Show [4-pack] was what was advertized and what I wanted.  I received for individual DVD's no box and have no response from the seller to repeated calls and e-mails asking for a resolution to either the error or the mis-advertizing of their items.  I do not plan on any more dealings with this individual and I question if Amazon has do all they should do to solve the issue.,1294185600,,415,4.3076923076923075
8000145,5,B0000D90AG,"Being from The Muppet Show generation, I was so excited about this collection to buy for my children! There is an innocent goodness about its humor that is rare today. The characters and musical numbers are awesome!",1147996800,,215,4.837837837837838
8000146,1,B0000D90AG,"As a previous review stated, a few years ago Time Life offered ""The Best of the Muppet Show"" as a ten disc series.  They may still be offering this order on Bamzu or who knows where.

However, I would not pay $100 for this.  I'd recommend waiting for the seasons to come out and buying those (a more complete selection, certainly) or looking for someone willing to sell their Time Life edition.

The intros done by Brian Henson are interesting, but if you're looking for loads of special features, you'll probably be a bit disappointed.",1145232000,8,536,4.610526315789474

8000150,2,B0000D90AG,"I have just purchased a Region 2 (English) Muppet Four-pack that has SIX episodes per disc - totalling 24 episodes in all! Why do you Americans have to make do with 50% less? Search out the Region 2 collection for far better value for money!
Ps. the contents of my set are excellent.",1089417600,62,283,4.3584905660377355
8000151,5,B0000D90AG,"This 4-dvd box contains 12 complete episodes with some of the best Muppet moments ever! Every episode has one great guest star and wonderful funny musical numbers.
Disc 1: Peter Sellers, John Cleese and Dudley Moore.
Disc 2: Elton John, Julie Andrews and Gene Kelly.
Disc 3: Mark Hamill (with C3PO, R2D2 and Chewbacca), Paul Simon and Raquel Welch.
Disc 4: Harry Belafonte, Linda Ronstadt and John Denver.
This is a great collection of tv shows many grownups will love to watch too. I used to love the Muppet Show when I was a child and I am glad to say those characters and settings have lost none of their charm.
I think this is the perfect show for kids: lots of music, delightful characters, NO VIOLENCE... just pure fun and the unbelievable imagination of Mr. Jim Henson.
Personal favorites: Peter Sellers reciting Richard III while playing two chickens(!), Elton John playing ""Crocodile Rock"" in a swamp full of crocodiles, John Cleese refusing to sing ""The Impossible Dream"", Kermit dancing with Gene Kelly, The Muppet band rioting against Paul Simon's music machine and (last but not least) that wild group of aspargus!!
All episodes have an introduction by Jim Henson's son. The extras in each disc are very few (ONE short sketch, ONE original drawing, a few trailers ...that's it!).
The episodes have no subtitles.
The content is five stars. I just think these dvds should have lots of extras, I mean... I am sure there are lots of material out there. Will we ever get tired of the muppets? NEVER!",1082505600,73,1507,4.777777777777778
8000152,5,B0000D90AG,"My sons got the set for Christmas and we've all enjoyed it.  It's good fun, everything you remember the muppets being.  Everyone who enjoyed the original tv series, but doesn't really like the feature films will be glad they purchased this Muppet set.  It has enough adult humor for the parents, and fun for the kids too.  Have an afternoon, watch them all, only have a little time-just watch one episode.  It's a great buy for 12 episodes, I'm ordering two others today!",1073260800,17,471,4.626506024096385
