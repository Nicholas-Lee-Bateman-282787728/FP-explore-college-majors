Season 4 however is not finished...but the sad news is that the reason for the hold off on airing them is because season 4 is the final and last season of icarly..but be looking forward for more episodes in the spring featuring:(michelle Obama) as a special guest,and a few more suprises!

4568674,5,B0054JELWU,"Hi, Dan Schneider had split the season in half after 45 episodes were ordered for Season 2 & 3 but he did not change the Production Codes to 3xx for Season 3
for the split.
Dan Schneider had kept Season 3 in the 2xx Production Codes that made
Season 4 in the 3xx Production Codes.
Now it all mass up the season for iCarly by confusing lots of peoples over the
internet.
For this DVD, It not the completed Season 3.
The completed Season 3 is in Season 2, Vol 3.
This DVD is the iCarly Season 4, Vol 1.

So there you go if you want 4 get the 3rd season if you want the 3rd season get the iCarly season 2, Volume 3 just a heads up Volume 3 doesn't include iThink They Kissed and iCook their actually in iCarly season 2, Volume 2.

Season 4:

What only 8 actual episodes from season 3? This is a full season?? Especially even when the listing for downloading episodes from Amazon shows 19 episodes for Season 3!

I bought this for a friends daughter for her birthday. She is to young to really write any reviews, but I can. All I can say, is if this is truely a full season set, something is seriously wrong with film company or they ""Falsely Advertised"" a sell. From what I have been able to gather about this show, the last 2 episodes are not even Season 3 but are from Season 4 and the last one (iParty) is not even a complete issue as filmed. It is cut and chopped, but when I read other reviews on here about this orginazation and the way they put out DVD I am not so suprised. Be warned when buying anything for anyone from [...] and its kids shows. What a rip-off!",1314921600,6,1161,4.137777777777778

There is no deep plots or really any life lessons to be learned. I give it three stars because it keeps my kid occupied, doesn't give kids any wrong impressions, and is overall the production quality seems pretty solid.
