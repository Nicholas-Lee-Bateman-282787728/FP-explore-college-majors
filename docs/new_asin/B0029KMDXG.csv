3877059,5,B0029KMDXG,"This is the third DVD featuring the graceful yet powerful yoga instructor, Zyrka Landjwit. I would highly recommend purchasing this DVD, if you enjoy vinyasa or Flow style of yoga where asana is linked with breath, and appreciate fluid slower movement. That said, moving slower requires more strength, control, and focused intention which is what I love about this practice.

Similar to her other DVDs, Zyrka's verbal instructions or cu-ing are impeccable which allows the viewer to be mindful of the poses without having to constantly look at the TV screen.

Unlike her other DVD's this is an intermediate level vinyasa practice in the Saraswati River Yoga tradition. This DVD contains 6 yoga workouts of varying lengths. Series A is slightly slower (not to be confused with Ashtanga Series A) with yoga routines of varying length - 24, 45, and 60min. Series B is slightly more challenging and include mantra and pranyama with yoga routines 30, 50, and 75min in length. The DVD includes separate yoga nidra and yoga surya practices.

All her DVDs are filmed against the beauty and serenity common to Santa Barbara, CA area.",1249257600,21,1124,5.0
3877060,5,B0029KMDXG,"I love this dvd. I won't go into great detail since others have already done so. However, I will say that I'm fairly new to Yoga. Not a beginner but hovering around intermediate and this is a wonderful practice to start easing into the more challenging poses. I already own Zyrka's other two dvds which are gentler and it was a no-brainer to go back to her teaching for the third time.
Here's what I like so much about this one:

-Zyrka Landwijt is a pleasure to workout with. She has a calming presence and moves with grace and purpose.

-She verbally guides you through it the whole way so you don't have to keep looking up at the tv to see what you are supposed to be doing.

-She offers constant guidance on how to hold the poses correctly. This is really important for those of us who are still pretty new and learning.

-The scenery is beautiful and the music lovely but more importantly; not distracting

-She's added a 25 minute session of Yoga Nidra. It is deep and relaxing guided meditation. I'd never tried that before and have since become a devotee of that as well.

-There are eight sessions to choose from. Although, in the Yoga Nidra you will not be doing any poses except corpse pose.

There's no need to list the things I don't like because there aren't any. I'm consistently impressed with her teaching and the extras that she provides on her dvds. I very much recommend it.",1248739200,42,1394,4.443137254901961
3877061,5,B0029KMDXG,"Many years ago, I started my yoga practice at Integral Hatha yoga Institute in the West Village, NYC.  The classes were traditional hatha yoga, that started with chanting and breathing practices and proceeded with simple but effective yoga asanas.  Afterwards, I felt calm and peaceful. This dvd reminds of those classes. Here is what you can expect.

Setting:  Beach in Southern CA, with waves rushing in.  Very tranquil.
Music:  It has the best new age Indian music I have heard on a dvd.  Not intrusive but you know it's there.
Teacher:  Very soothing and direct voice.  Her cuing is excellent.
Format:  This dvd has 2 levels, A & B.  Each level has 3 classes of varying length.  If memory serves me
Level A - 24 min, 50 min, 60 min Beginning - Advanced beginning level
Level b - 30 min  60 min, 75 min. Advanced beginning level to intermediate

In each level, each class builds on the previous class. I think that this is a great format as one now has no excuse not to do yoga every day, as time permits.  I did the 24 minute class one day; and the 75 minute class on another day.

In level A, the basic poses are covered and held with long holds and lots of detail. The classes start with a very soothing moving cobra - cobra to sphinx to child's pose and back. In Level B, the classes start with a mantra that the teacher sings as the words run across the screen. (An english translation is not given) She then leads you in 3 rounds of kabbalapti (sp) breath.  You have the option of skipping this section if chanting is not your thing.  The poses are linked with vinyasa and move faster.  The box says that this is an intermediate dvd.  There are 2 ways to look at this.  The poses themselves are not that hard or intermediate, but the long holds may make it difficult for true beginners.  I sweated quite a bit when I did the 75 min, level b class.

Poses covered are triangle, bound triangle, warrior 1, 2, bound warrior, crescent lunge variations, pyramid pose variation, standing wide angle, reverse warrior, half moon, standing split, side plank, bridge, bow pose, upward bow, shoulder stand, plow variations, seated wide angle, one legged seated forward bend, seated twist, reclining twist, side stretch, butterfly, fish pose and savasana.  I may have missed a pose or two but the classes are very well organized. You will get a full body workout.

There are two treats on this dvd.  The first one is a separate 37 minute section of sun salutation c with mantras to activate the chakras.  It starts with pranayama, then simple spine stretches then proceeds to 34 minutes of sun salutes. You have the option to listen to her call each step in the salute along with the corresponding chakra or do it with the mantras only. Very nice. The second treat is a 15+ yoga nidra, guided relaxation. If you are having a high energy day, you can do the salutes and then chose an asana class followed by yoga nidra.  I have only done the salute section alone, and believe me 35 minutes of sun salutes is a workout.

All in all, I liked this dvd a lot and I think it would fit into anyones hectic schedule.  The Saraswati River tradition is an ancient Yoga tradition that reminds us that yoga is much more than just poses.  It is about calming one's mind and it reminds me that the asanas are just a preparation to train the body to sit in meditation.  As I said in the beginning it brought back to my days at IYI. Thank you.  Get this dvd if you want a gentle yet somewhat challenging simple yet calming flow.  Namaste.",1248652800,96,3519,4.446875
3877062,5,B0029KMDXG,I really like this instuctor. At this point it is a little beyond my capabilities but I got it for the Yoga Nidra in which she allows for a sankalpa to be made. This is a separate selection from the exercise program which makes it perfect. She gives the surya yoga separately with the mantras which eliminates toxins and purifies the pingala nadi.,1247875200,8,347,4.523809523809524

3877065,5,B0029KMDXG,"I have stacks of yoga videos, but this is the one I use the most. I love that you can choose from 6 different programs depending upon how much time you have available.

3877067,5,B0029KMDXG,"I am usually too lazy to write reviews... but... Over the years I have used several different Yoga DVDs so I can practice at home and on the go. It is not as good as being in the room with the instructor, but it is way much better than doing yoga on your own. This DVD is well planned. It allows you to chose between the amount of time you have and the level of difficulty you can handle, so if you are out of shape or in a hurry, you can chose the level A for 24 min... or if you are in good shape and with a lot of time, why not level B for 90 min? It suits me fine, as long as I can get on the mat a little every day. Zyrka is a joy to be with, and the music and scenery are just right to get the job done....

thanks,",1350000000,2,721,3.5923566878980893

3877070,4,B0029KMDXG,I have been looking for a DVD that has all the basic moves with beginning to advance levels. This DVD is great very high quality. I am new to the chanting of the mantras that goes on this Dvd so I thought it was a bit odd at first but you can fast forward if you do not like it. But it is a great exercise. Highly recommend...,1314576000,,326,3.8088235294117645
3877071,5,B0029KMDXG,This DVD was an excellent next-step up from gentle yoga.  I enjoyed the exercises and the instructor is quite amazing. Product arrived on-time and was as stated.,1314230400,2,161,4.962962962962963
3877072,3,B0029KMDXG,"I just started using this DVD and I was slightly disappointed because everyone else talked so highly about it.  Maybe I am just used to my old Rodney Ye's Power Yoga (Excellent) and this was not that.  She does quite a few positions,none of them intermediately challenging from the 4 segments I watched thus far.  I have to do the 75 and 80 minute one.  I am less motivated to try because she is too repetitive in her routines,and actually she doesn't even do her whole routine on each section.  The DVD has been spliced together.  This I find totally a turn off.  When I did Rodney ye's stuff,he was there for a full hour and I was whipped afterwards.  His pace is much quicker, however he holds is postures longer and his instruction is much clearer.  This woman speaks very low and in yogi language half the time, so if you don't know those names for your postures you are lost.  I was also lost because she describes her steps in too descriptively a way and I also found my self in opposite postures to her by following her.  I did not feel as if I got a real work out when I was done.  She sort of whimsically moves quickly without holding postures.  I felt as if she was bored with doing the DVD..or something.  Well, that's it.  Buy Rodney Ye..Power Yoga and you'll get a workout.",1294185600,6,1287,4.326359832635983
3877073,5,B0029KMDXG,I absolutely love this dvd which is now a regular favorite for me.  The voice-over is not intrusive and the routines are enjoyable.  I usually do these first thing in the morning and feel great for the rest of the day.  Wish she had more ....,1291680000,2,242,4.217391304347826
3877074,5,B0029KMDXG,"This is a good intermediate flow DVD to add to your collection. I'll be reaching for this one often. Zyrka is very calming in her vocal tone, so while this is a solid practice, I tend to practice with this DVD when I need a calming influence as well as a good routine.",1284768000,2,268,4.0754716981132075
3877075,5,B0029KMDXG,"I found this video challenging enough to keep me interested, yet easy enough to not make it a chore. I've only been practicing yoga for about a year so am still learning. Right now the 45 min. practice is perfect for me. I am glad that this dvd has progressive workouts so that one may work at their own pace. Zyrka is a clear and concise teacher. I thoroughly enjoyed my workout and look forward to working with this dvd.",1283731200,3,422,4.2875
3877076,4,B0029KMDXG,"Great workouts. No mystical stuff. The transitions from pose to pose feel good. The instructor explains poses well, and the camera captures the moves so you can easily follow along. My only complaint is that the background music is so loud that it is sometimes hard to hear the instructor. I'm sure this won't matter much once I get used to the routines, but the first time, it was hard to follow because I couldn't always hear the soft voice.",1282521600,3,443,4.55
3877077,4,B0029KMDXG,"I am very satisfied with this dvd.  Zyrka's voice is soothing and never annoying.  I like that she does not rush through the poses. They are held just long enough to feel the stretch and feel my muscles working, without over doing it.  I just skip the breathing and chanting in the beginning.  I'm glad I added it to my yoga dvd collection.",1275350400,2,340,4.349206349206349
3877078,4,B0029KMDXG,"To be honest, I haven't gone through the whole dvd because I am always short on time, but I do like it so far. There are different time frames you can choose.

You can skip the chants if you like, which I do. The shortest time intervals are pretty easy, perhaps because it's short. Although I've tried yoga before I wasn't consistent in the past, but now I try to do yoga at least 3 times a week. I just started and I think the ones with the shortest time intervals are easy including the B (advance). I haven't tried the longer ones to really give a better review.

Update!!!

Today I tried the 50 min (B). For me, it is challenging because I don't have the experience. There's a shoulder stand segment which I should ease into it. It's not easy as I thought. I think this a good dvd for beginners who want to transition to intermediate. I hope someday I can do the handstand pose.",1275350400,,882,4.238095238095238
3877079,5,B0029KMDXG,"I would consider myself an ""intermediate"" practitioner of yoga, but my husband is new to practice.  We ordered this so we could do yoga together at home.  I can't remember what made me finally choose this DVD over some of the others (Rodney Yee, Shiva Rea, etc.) but I'm SO glad I did.  I am SO impressed Zyrka's teaching and her video.  She provides 6 different sessions.  3 are a bit easier, and 3 are more challenging.  They are of varying lengths so you can tailor your yoga session to your time or energy level.  My husband and I have been doing the 45 minute session from the easier group.  It is a little challenging for him, but not so much so that he gets discouraged.  The poses are less challenging for me, which is nice too because I can refine the subtleties of my practice that way.  (square the shoulders or hips a bit more, breathe more deeply into the pose, release more slowly from plank, release more deeply in any of the poses).  So it is a great DVD for both of us.  We have been using the video every day for a week now (since we received it) and already are noticing improvements in our bodies.

She flows so smoothly from pose to pose and gives a nice amount of time to ""be"" in a pose.  Her sequences just make sense.  There is a distinct pattern to the way she guides you through the poses that is reassuring.  I've taken many classes from many teachers throughout the years and Zyrka is right up there with the best of them.

I AM SO GLAD I DISCOVERED ZYRKA AND BOUGHT HER VIDEO.",1267056000,17,1505,4.261484098939929
3877080,4,B0029KMDXG,"I was really looking forward to a more advanced yoga practice with this instructor, since I already have Gentle Vinyasa Flow and I use it more often than any of my other yoga DVDs.  Zyrka's soft, soothing voice is exquisite on that one, and would have been just as wonderful on this one except she was so sick with a cold when she recorded this soundtrack that I found myself unable to bear listening to her.  If my head was as stopped up as hers was, I think I would have waited until it cleared up before recording the postures for my audience to listen to over and over again.  I did not keep this DVD because of this one sticking point.  The scenery is even more beautiful than her previous release, and the exercises were just as flowing and well-planned, but I hope that in future she'll do the instruction part of her recording when she is well.",1261699200,4,852,4.339622641509434
3877081,5,B0029KMDXG,"If you are looking for an Intermediate Yoga DVD for your home practice, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one than ""Yoga: Flow"" with Zyrka Landwijt.  The series is wonderfully designed to increase your practice as you feel prepared to do so.  The instructor, Zyrka, has such a calming voice as she gently reminds you on proper positioning for each posture you'll feel like your melting into your pose.  She is a beautiful spirit.  Clearly, Zyrka takes this practice to some space higher because of her presence.

I'm still working my way through the various series.  But, this is a flow series... so, you can expect to be moving most of the time: Sun Salutations to Warrior to Triangle (holding some poses for a few breathes as pertinent).

After trying dozens of Yoga DVDS, this is my favorite series thus far.

Thank you.",1259625600,8,828,4.662068965517242
3877082,5,B0029KMDXG,"I have about 20 yoga DVDs that I thoroughly enjoy, and I practice with probably six or so of those regularly. This DVD is one of two favorites. Here's why:

You can tell when an instructor wants to be a good guide, not just the star of a yoga DVD. Zyrka Landwijt is an excellent teacher. Not only is her cuing for posture changes spot on, she also provides suggestions that help you think about getting into correct position, often emphasizing connection to the earth and/or the sky to quickly and clearly communicate proper alignment. It's inspiring to think about making the best contact with the ground beneath your feet instead of just making sure all of the corners of your feet are down.

The range of practice times and level of challenge is perfect. I'm at an advanced beginner to intermediate level, but this is one of those DVDs I know I will return to, even as a (hopefully) more advanced student, because the practices are an ideal combination of energizing and relaxing and fit into my schedule.

The Surya Yoga and Yoga Nidra are wonderful. It's difficult to find separate sun salutation and relaxation practices on yoga DVDs. These are both excellent. I'm surprised by how often I choose to do the Surya Yoga followed by a longer asana practice and then Yoga Nidra. Zyrka also provides some background on each practice in separate DVD sections.

There is some clear spiritual content, too, and I like that. For me, yoga is much more than a physical practice, so I am drawn to those practices that emphasize mind-body-spirit, particularly when the spiritual aspects are gentle for the practitioner to incorporate as s/he wishes. That's what you'll find here. And if you choose not to participate (in chanting, for instance), in many cases you can simply use the skip button on your remote/DVD player to go to the next section.

As others have written, the settings are beautiful and serene, and the music is peaceful yet flows with the practices. Zyrka's voice is clear yet calming. The asana sequences work up to challenging without being intimidating, and it is quite easy to modify them on your own (in addition to modifications and alternatives Zyrka offers) to suit your proficiency and how you're feeling on any given day. Others have given lots of good detail about the sequences themselves, but as I recall sequence A emphasizes strength while sequence B emphasizes endurance and includes more sun salutations. The emphasis is moderate, though, as both are well balanced.

If I had to come up with one disappointment, it would be that the Savasana for both sets of practices is quite short. I'm sure that's because there's the separate Yoga Nidra section, but when I don't have an extra 25 minutes I miss a moderate length closing relaxation or guided meditation. It would also be nice to be able to ""program"" a practice so the relaxation immediately follows the asana or Surya Yoga practices. But these are such minor negatives.

This is a truly wonderful DVD. You will enjoy it and practice with it often. I hope Zyrka plans to continue teaching us by video!",1259020800,32,3082,4.7819548872180455

I used this DVD all through deployment and after for relaxation and flexibility. Instruction through the video are great. When I later started going to yoga studios the instructors were impressed at my skill and technique learned only from a video. I highly recommend to anyone wanting to get started all the way to someone wanting a challenging practice at home. There are various length sessions and difficulties.

I am writing this review almost 5 years after my purchase. How many Amazon purchases do you even remember 5 years later. This Dvd transformed my fitness attitude and I still recommend this lesson to others.

8357872,5,B0029KMDXG,"I really liked Zyrka Landwijt's Gentle Vinyasa Flow and searched to see if she had something a little more challenging. I found this DVD but was reluctant to order it at first, because although I realize that there is more to yoga than just the physical practice of the asanas, the trailer sounded a little too geared to mantras and chakras than I was ready for. However, I took a chance and ordered it and I am very glad I did. The 2 more spiritually-geared practices are separate and the 6 ""main"" options are pretty standard yoga, other than the first 8 minutes of the three B series practices (which are recorded as a separate ""chapter"" so they can easily be skipped).

The best part is that when I did the A and B series practices (they call them 6 practices, but it is really two with options to do a short, medium or long version of each), I was blown away by how well-choreographed they are. There are some creative sequences and the whole practice flows very smoothly, incorporating all my favourite poses without too much repetition. The cuing is precise and the tone gentle and calming. I'm unlikely to do the shortest version of each series, but if I do skip the mantras in Series B, that leaves an approximately 45 minute and an approximately 60 minute option in each of series A and B, which is the perfect length for me (I tend to do the shorter ones on weekdays and the longer ones on the weekend).

Until now, my favorite yoga DVD has been Rodney Yee's Power Yoga for the Total Body, but this one (particularly the A series). has joined it at the top of my pile. To compare and contrast the two, I would say that this practice is perhaps not quite as vigorous, but the challenge comes from holding poses a little longer than Yee does. What they have in common is that both DVD's hold my focus so that an hour goes by in an instant and I have a feeling of accomplishment and gracefulness at the end.",1428105600,,1914,4.373595505617978

8357875,5,B0029KMDXG,"So I reviewed Zyrka's gentle vinyasa flow and gave it 4 stars. I did rave about her style and how well the dvd instruction was my only beef was the ending relaxation. If you are a beginner it is a ""must have"" it will not only teach you in a great form but offer a great workout.

This dvd would be 10 stars if i could give them! I am a beginner but practice almost every day. I knew I was ready to move into more advanced practice but simply could not find that ""intermediate bridge""  dvd to help me advance. Boy does this DVD do just that. If you are looking for a teacher that can grow your practice with you Zyrka is that teacher.

The DVD is a great format, just like gentle flow it has 2 tracks A & B both having 3 workouts that each build off the other. The A track is a little less intense than the B. So there is plenty of growth in the dvd. This dvd goes even deeper adding in the spiritual side of yoga in a very easy and attractive way for the western mind to grasp by adding 2 additional practices, One that focuses on the breathing and toning of the body as well as a deep relaxing meditative session for a total of 8 workouts on one dvd.

I could go on and on about how great a teacher she is and how great the dvd is but I will say if you are at that point where you feel like a strong beginner and are looking for someone to ""move you along"" in a doable rewarding way...this is it. Of all the yoga DVD's I have this one is it. It will be my main workout for months! Please do yourself a favor, don't get caught up in the yoga rock start hype, you may find yourself disappointed...Zyrka is a true teacher and will give you a great foundation that will benefit you a life time. Zyrka if you read these reviews, thank you...I give gratitude to you after every session.
