In between priceless lines like ""To  know the cat, you must =be= the cat"" are interminable strip routines.  To the jaded eye 35 years later, these are about as prurient as a National  Geographic special.
Of course, there are fans of this era, and they may  be disappointed by the Ed Wood facets of this film. De gustibus, eh?

264801,5,6300230066,"Good cover artwork and modern packaging, excellent digital reproduction for sound, clarity, color, and formatting.  There are some features: scene selection; original trailer; interviews; and list of `chapters.'
Released in June of 1965, ""Orgy of the Dead"" is a 92 minutes film that takes place in cemetery.  The Emperor of the Night and his Black Ghoul mistress, entertain themselves by having various women dance post mortem.  A hapless couple accidentally become privy to the scene, and are condemned to join the damned.  Forced to watch as an Native American Indian maiden, a streetwalker hooker, a gold digger woman, a woman in a catsuit, a tortured slave girl, a Spanish dancer senorita, a tropical island girl, a new bride, a zombie girl, and a feathers / furs / & fluff woman dancer; all end up (one at a time) clad only in g-strings as they gyrate, wiggle, jiggle, and writhe at the command of Criswell and Fawn Silver.
This film is listed among the 100 most amusingly bad movies ever made and was given a golden raspberry award.  The cape worn by Criswell is the same cape worn by Bela Lugosi in the ""Bud Abbott & Lou Costello Meet Frankenstein"" movie.
Basically Criswell and Fawn Silver emcee a recap of nine different lusty women from 1965 burlesque and go-go dancer acts.  It isn't an orgy, and the only thing dead is the script.  But you don't buy this DVD for acting, story, writing, continuity or for that matter even for directing or editing.  What you watch this for is the women who dance 95% nude.  I still don't think it qualifies as grindhouse sleaze, even though I will say I think that's what the producer and director were hoping for with the film's title.  Most of Ed Wood's efforts get categorized that way I suppose.  Cheesy and trashy? Yes.  Five star excellence? That pivots upon what you expected when you decided to watch ""Orgy of the Dead"" and in that perspective, then yes.  Meant to be a parody of horror films?  Unfortunately, probably not.  Women erotically dancing attractive?  Six of them were actually very athletic, moved well, and should generate a rise in any male's Levi's.  Frightening?  It would be if I were 4 years old.  I'm not 4 years old.  So no.
This should have been one of the most popular cult films of horror / thriller genre in the 1960's, and I'm not able to think of ANY film made in the last ten years that can outdo what ""Orgy of the Dead"" delivers.  It should be noted however that the girlfriend in the convertible named `Shirley' is played by the same actress / dancer who doubles as the gold digger woman; so all that was left for this movie to be great is for Fawn Silver (Black Ghoul mistress) to also similarly dance.  Let's face it, this is one of a tosser's between-the-mattress-stash top ten DVD restorations.  That's it.",1349740800,4,2792,4.641547861507128
264802,1,6300230066,"To be perfectly frank the camera was trash, the fug indescribable, and the tits: fantastic. The only savior of this messy production was the boobies. And O me garsh did I enjoy the boobies. This piece of film was sexy and seductive but remained tasteful as there was no vagina. GROSS. Also the lack of penis was somewhat frustrating, Ed Wood, a cross dresser and eccentric boy toy, couldn't include a single throbbing penis. As far as i could see, which wasn't far considering the fog, this porno had some of the best dancing I've seen since Fred Astaire. The cat, or whatever creature costume they used with the titties cut out, had some moves reminiscent of the last moments of life, writhing around on the floor gasping for air. The plot contained some loosely organized points, one of which were the driving scenes with the man and the woman, whom you wanted to see her tits but didn't, had day and nighttime cutaways. Confusing and titillating. To describe this flick in one word is to sum up existence in a phrase, SHIT.",1347580800,,1026,4.612021857923497
264803,2,6300230066,"Even Ed Wood should be embarrassed and ashamed of this train wreck! This is not even really a movie per se, but instead is just an excuse to get 9 or 10 girls topless. Now as a heterosexual male my eyes didn't mind those scenes, but I was here to watch an Ed Wood horror/sci-fi movie and instead just got a showpiece for lousy dancers. Criswell acts like he's really drunk or high and Fawn Silver out acts him by a mile! She at least comes across as moderately creepy and weird which is a lot more than I can say for the Wolfman and the Mummy. Holy cow are those two an embarrassment to any Universal monster or mythical creature that preceded them! The Wolfman makeup you buy at Wal-Mart would be better than this and the Mummy sounds like a guy with a traffic cone over his head, reading lines offstage. And you won't BELIEVE the stupidity of these lines. I'm an Ed Wood completist. I had to see this film, but you don't. Honestly if they would have eliminated ALL dancing scenes they would have a pretty funny and enjoyable film. The problem is they'd also have only 14 minutes...",1347408000,,1083,4.3399014778325125

Criswell is more unintentionally creepy than ever, but the real joy in this movie are the ""dancers.""  In addition to being horribly non-PC in many cases, the best (and only) way to watch the dances is to speed up the DVD player.  2x is okay, but 4x is the best.  Makes the dances hilarious, and a much more watchable length.  They are as un-sexy as they could be, speeding them up makes them something all together new, and gutbusting funny.

The acting of the couple who are abducted and forced to watch the ""Orgy Of The Dead"" is some of the greatest wooden acting of all time.  Anything else could be AS bad, but worse is not possible.

And all of this is topped off by snappy banter between the Wolf Man and The Mummy.  You read that right.  Must be experienced to be believed.

All in all, well worth it for an evening of family entertainment.  Makes ""Plan 9"" look like ""District 9,"" I kid you not.  Enjoy.",1332547200,2,1083,4.245098039215686

There is also an interesting interview with Apostolof, in which he relates some amusing anecdotes.  He also asserts Ed Wood had no talent as a director, but since immediately after this film I watched ""Night of the Ghouls"" and ""Plan 9 from outer space,"" I must disagree.  Orgy of the dead is wooden and silly at best, and tells no real story.

That's what I said.

It's mind-numbing and ""written"" by Ed D. Wood, Jr. My standout favorite for years is the ""Fluff Dance"" bride dancer and her ability to make each of her, umm... two assets twirl together or independently. I turned on the Village People song ""Milkshake"" in sync with it and it's even better. I'm sure the current milkshake song would work as well!

I'm strangely enamoured of these dancin' babes. All in their 60's now I suppose, parents, grandparents...? Oh my.

And oh yes, great transfer! I'm not sure if I've ever seen a dvd like this from that era look so crisp, clear and colorful, wow.

264809,2,6300230066,"Written, but not directed, by the one and only Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Adapted from his novel!), ""Orgy Of The Dead"" is a mind-numbing mating of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" and a grindhouse nudie flick. For something that has the pedigree of supplying tacky fun and cheap snickers, it's a surprisingly dull and ultimately, sad ride through the world of Z-list cinema.

Things kick off promisingly as Hollywood psychic and Wood regular Criswell rises from the grave as the swishy Emperor of the Night, whose goal is to be entertained with a low-rent evening of depravity. By his side is the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), a Vampira-meets Elvira stand-in, right down to her low-cut cleavage and jet-black bouffant wig. Criswell's hammy demeanor, cue card read lines and ridiculous dialogue are good for a few laughs.

But the laughs end there as young couple Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) wreck their car (maybe because the scenes veer between night and day) and wind up near Criswell's cemetery lair. They're eventually tied to posts and are forced to watch a parade of half-inspired G-stringed strippers, who cat around in theme-styled numbers. Meanwhile, Criswell's henchmen The Mummy and the Wolfman (in possibly the most depressing costumes in the history of horror movies) can only look on at the spectacle, as the budget did not allow them dollar bills for lap dances (it seemed to all go to the fog machine, which occasionally obscures the action). They are more or less present as comic relief, but their groan-inducing humor is neither comic nor a relief.

The transfer quality is much better than this picture deserves. Extras include the original trailer and a bizarrely entertaining interview with Bulgarian-born director and Wood co-conspirator Stephen C. Apostolof (billed as A.C. Stephens).

264822,3,6300230066,"Movie rates 3 stars; DVD transfer rates 1 star.

I first saw Orgy of the Dead in a 1969 Halloween film festival.  Orgy was sandwiched between Reptilicus and Creature from the Black Lagoon 2.
Gives a whole new meaning to wet my lizard, doesn't it?

Frankly none of the three titles mentioned should be considered a movie.
Orgy is nothing more than a vehicle to get twelve topless dancers strutting their stuff.  The star, Criswell and his brunette sidekick, Princess of the Dead, merely introduce each act.  The accompanying music is cheesy.  Ed Wood could have produced a monument to jiggle if he hadn't scrimped on music royalties.

A few words on Criswell, for those of you who have never heard of him.
Born in England as Jerome Criswell Konig, he migrated to the US shortly after WW2.  He had some reputation in England as a radio-based psychic,
and quickly found a following in Hollywood.

A good buddy of Ed Wood, he was a fixture in Ed Wood movies and authored several books on psychic predictions.  Was he a charlatan or really psychic?  Criswell predicted that JFK would not run for re-election in 1964, because of an incident in November 1963.  This 1962 prediction is a matter of record seen and heard by thousands tuned in to the Jack Paar show, predecessor to Johnny Carson's Tonight show.  In one of his books, though, Criswell predicted that Richard Nixon would resign (in 1970, actually four years before his downfall), to be replaced by the landslide election of Mae West, a one-term female president.  When he's right, he's scary; when he's wrong, . . .

If you love topless dancers, this movie is for you.  Made in 1965, just before the avalanche of siliconed boobs, Orgy does present some truly lovely women.  No real plot is followed, just an endless stream of topless, jiggling beauties.  Some dancers are obviously pros, while others are starving actresses.  Coleen O'Brien is my fave, and she did
not appear to be starved.

This DVD transfer has some problems, mainly pixelation disruptions.  I was told that the disc may not even play in DVD players with low fault-tolerance.  In other words, buyer beware.  Not only is the movie low-ball, so is the DVD pressing.",1200960000,,2187,4.742705570291777

They are soon taken hostage from these 2 musclehead goons and tied to a stake when the lord of the dead and his mistress appear. Soon afterwards , the dead start to appear performing a ritual dance .

264825,1,6300230066,"I had this on my Wish List (because I have a general interest in Ed Wood) but changed my mind and removed it--unfortunately not before a friend bought it for me.  So what the heck, I thought, and popped it in the DVD player.

Oh boy.  OK, here's the deal: there's being an Elvis fan, and there's buying a styrofoam cup of water he was drinking onstage that someone's been keeping in a freezer since the 1970s..  There's being an Ed Wood fan, and there's paying money for this.  A ""good"" Ed Wood movie leaves you alternatly howling with laughter, dumbstruck, and fascinated by just how weird the guy was.  A ""bad"" Ed Wood movie is therefore...wow, I don't have the words to describe it.  My understanding is that he was marginally involved with thing at best anyway.

Maybe the problem is that I'm a straight woman.  See, this movie is about boobies.  Lots of jiggling boobies.  It goes something like this: Emperor of the Dead Criswell and his Princess of the Dead introduce and call upon a dead woman with a sinful past to dance for their pleasure.  Girl emerges from mausoleum in costume.  Girl quickly loses costume.  Girl does an interpretive dance to 60s soundtrack in a G-string or panties.  Boobies jiggle!  Criswell looks on approvingly!  (And that's creepy right there.) Cut to our living heroes, failing miserably to act tied up and scared.  Cut to mummy and werewolf who seem to be from the set of ""The Monkees"" looking on approvingly (yes, you read that correctly).

Now, repeat that ten more times.

So, if you like strip clubs or boobies (or both), or if you like interpretive dance AND happen to be under the influence of certain illegal substances, you might like this.

I am certain that somewhere in Ohio, a grandmother is shopping on Amazon for her kids' holiday presents, stumbles across this DVD listing, and lets out a blood-curdling scream.  Why?  Because 40 years ago, she was performing the ""Slave Dance.""  And 39 years ago, when she was on a bus from L.A. back to her parents' house, she was thinking, ""No one will ever know...because no one will ever show that thing again..

Storyline: A young couple on a road trip stranded in purgatory where sins are expiated by nude dancing. Criswell and Fawn Silver (the original Elvira) judge the quality of each nudies soul based on their strip tease.

It's worth watching for Fawn Silver who does a sexy knife dance with exquisitely bad acting but, unfortunately, no stripping. What ever happened to Fawn Silver anyway?

264827,3,6300230066,"""Orgy of the Dead"" was the first movie that Ed 'Plan 9' Wood made with sleazy soft-core director ""A.C. Stephen"" (real name: Stephen Apostolof). It's the ""story"" of the emperor of the dead (Criswell!) and his bride who is a cemetary watch numerous really bad striptease acts. Each act has a theme - streetwalker, torture, cat, snake, fire, etc. The dances are barely choreographed and extremely boring, but there is still much for devoted Ed Wood fans to get a kick out of, such as the bad dialogue, the amazingly wooden acting (particularly from the young leading couple), and Criswell's unforgettable line readings (""Torture! Torture! It pleasures me!"").
The full frame DVD from Rhino looks nothing short of amazing. The blindingly bright and sharp colours look much better, I'm sure, than previous video releases. There are a few scratches, but it barely matters. The mono soundtrack doesn't fare as well with the dialogue, but the music sounds crystal clear.
Fans of this film (and are there any?) will be happy to know that an interview with Stephen Apostolof is included. Apostolof talks about how he met Ed Wood, tidbits on the production of ""Orgy of the Dead,"" his ideas for a sequel, and even advice for film directors (yeah, thanks a lot). It's kind of funny, considering that he actually seems to think he made a good movie. A very good looking theatrical trailer and some nice menus are also included.",1103587200,5,1412,4.863070539419087
264828,5,6300230066,"For dedicated sleazologists this has to rank as one of the top DVD releases/restorations so far this year. While readily available in the past on VHS, this digitally remastered transfer supervised by director Stephen C. Apostolof (""A. C. Stephen"") makes obsolete all previous releases, including Rhino's, which looks shockingly flat, blurry, and faded in comparison. Orgy of the Dead looks like a real movie now (if not necessarily a GOOD one), with excellent color balance and saturation, contrast, brightness, sharpness, and shadow/highlight detail. Exploitation stalwart Bob Caramico's cinematography looks better than it has any right to, and the color is so rich it's hard to believe it's typically fast-fading Eastmancolor. While IMDb says this movie was in 2.35:1 widescreen (it was advertised as being in `Astravision'), it's presented full frame here. The compositions look fine, however, without any cramped, cropped feeling (the common `two noses talking' scenes or other weirdness), leading one to believe that this is the `open matte' version, which was cropped to widescreen aspect ratio in theaters. At any rate, the print looks stunning overall, extremely watchable, with only some occasional very light speckling evident.

The movie, written by the notorious Edward D. Wood, Jr. (Plan 9, Glen or Glenda, etc.), based on his novel (!!), is a curious hodgepodge of hokey monster matinee cliches and typical early-1960s nudie-cutie hijinks. Opening with Ed's standard florid Criswell monologue, Orgy of the Dead's short-lived story line presents struggling horror writer Bob and wife Shirley (sexploitation legend Pat Barrington/Barringer with flaming red hair), out driving one night looking for an old cemetery for ""inspiration."" (Barrington's character is named after Ed Wood's ""drag"" alter ego.) Bob loses control of the car, they crash, then stumble on a graveyard where the Emperor Ghoul (Criswell), the Black Ghoul (Vampira wannabe Fawn Silver), and their striped-shorts-and-armband-clad beefcake henchmen are presiding over some sort of dance revue/judgment of dead souls. Coincidentally, all the judged are female and next to naked. For the next 80 minutes, a bevy of voluptuous dead babes in G-strings each in turn do a ""theme"" interpretive strip dance (Indian, Skeleton, Cat, Golden Girl dipped in molten ""gold"" a la Goldfinger, Zombie, Hawaiian, etc.), complete with plenty of emotive gesturing and breast-jiggling amidst swirling ground fog, accompanied on the soundtrack by vaguely Les Baxter-ish exotica and Henry Mancini/Herb Alpert-ish lite pop cues. (I love the ""yahoo wahoo"" chant behind the Indian dance.) Interspersed with the dances are snippets of those patented non sequitur Ed Wood dialogue exchanges between Bob, Shirley, the Emperor Ghoul, Black Ghoul, and crummy, dime-store Werewolf and moth-eaten Mummy. Unlike many (most?) sexploitation movies of the era, the dancers are generally quite buff and several are certifiable knockouts. Barrington remains clothed as Shirley but displays her awesome (augmented) ""ticket sellers"" (Apostolof's term) doubling as the Golden Girl in a brassy blonde wig. There is a brief, surprising whipping/bondage scene, and it's revealed that the Black Ghoul swings both ways when she demands to have Shirley for herself! (Silver as the Black Ghoul does a sultry knife-dance but unfortunately no striptease.) TV psychic Criswell appears rather glassy-eyed and reads from obvious off-camera cue cards much of the time. It all winds up with a corny ""was it all a dream?"" twist ending. As reviled as this movie is by mainstream viewers (see reviews on IMDb), sexploitation veterans can vouch that as nudie-cuties go, Orgy of the Dead is relatively painless; some of the dances are actually mildly erotic (if occasionally out of sync with the music), while Eddie's convoluted dialogue, Criswell's hammy declamations, and the otherwise stiff, amateurish acting provide welcome moments of charming Bad Movie ambiance in the framing scenes.

The extras comprise a trailer  (surprisingly looking just as terrific as the feature) and an amusing 20-minute interview with director/producer Apostolof, who recounts his beginnings in the film industry, recalls meeting and working with Ed Wood, and expounds on film technique (!!) and his decision not to go ""hardcore"", all in a likeable, droll manner. Orgy of the Dead is definitely not for the mainstream viewer; there is zero narrative trajectory and relatively little dialogue, mainly just lots of topless exotic dancing, making it extremely tedious or even boring for many, especially at 92 minutes. If, however you're already a fan of grade-Z schlock horror and/or cheap sexploitation, Rhino's pristine new transfer makes this bizarre, unique delight slide down smoother than a cold beer. Essential trash!!",1085875200,61,4822,5.540027137042062

picture through and through. He wrote the screenplay (based on his novel, don't you know), but his imprimatur is evident in
other aspects of the flick as well - from the utterly horrible performances to the cheesy special effects to the constant confusion
between night and day.
Just what in the world is going on here? Criswell, the famed prognosticator from PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE and
other Wood jewels, presides over a graveyard bacchanal in which cheap looking ghoul-strippers display their wares for The Master's entertainment. A young couple stumble upon these ghastly revels and become the next victims of the ""night people.""
That's about it for plot. What's left are prolonged dance routines, incoherent ""comic relief"" from a barely wrapped mummy and a hardly-concealed werewolf (you can see the actor's throat), and the almost immediate sensation that one is in the middle of a very bad dream.
But just try to take your eyes off these proceedings! This is Ed D. Wood in vivid 1960's color, man! This is Criswell crying
maniacally, ""Torture! Torture! It gives me pleasure!"" This is the kind of mesmerizing midnight fare that assured Wood's legend.

It's all so incredibly bad, you won't be able to take your eyes off it.  If there is a weak point, it is that too much time is spent showcasing the dancers.

7806741,3,6300230066,"Whenever you see the name Ed Wood you know you're in for a treat of the worst written, directed or produced films ever made. His name has become synonymous with bad movies, in part because the book THE GOLDEN TURKEY AWARDS written by Harry and Michael Medved placed his film PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE as the worst movie ever made. I honestly cant think of a movie associated with Wood with the exception of the biopic directed by Tim Burton about him that was good.

And yet there is a certain charm about his movies. This was the little guy determined to make a break into the film business in any way imaginable. And to tell the truth he actually did so given that were still talking about him 39 years after he passed away. While his movies may have been bad, filled with string held hubcaps for flying saucers and cardboard tombstones that shook or fell over when anyone walked near them, you find yourself watching them whenever they pop up. You might laugh at what you're watching but you ARE watching.

While both PLAN 9 and THE BRIDE OF THE MONSTER are the most famous films Wood directed he later went on to do more mundane films, mostly nudie cutie films that featured various topless women either dancing or doing burlesque routines. Remember this was when burlesque wasn't frowned upon and less sexual than what strip clubs offer these days. In 1965 Wood wrote a film and turned the directing chores over to Stephen Apostolof. That film was ORGY OF THE DEAD and has gained a reputation all its own.

The film tells the story of a young couple, Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington), out for a night drive to a nearby cemetery. Bob is a horror novelist and wants to go there for inspiration while Shirley just wants to go home. A crash lands them in said cemetery where strange happenings are taking place. The Emperor of the Night (Criswell) is being entertained by the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver) beneath a full moon. That entertainment is the performances of ten different scantily clad women, all of whom eventually become topless and who have certain themes to their dances.

Along for the ride, and for comic relief, are a Wolfman and Mummy, both featuring some of the worst monster make up ever. Lets just admit it, the Wolfman is a guy wearing a mask and gloves from a Halloween store. The Emperor sees Bob and Shirley and has the duo capture them and tie them up to two monuments to watch the evenings entertainment. The Black Ghoul wants to kill the two of them but throughout the night the Emperor tells her there is still time, get on with the dancing.

And there you have the entire plot of the movie. At most maybe 5 pages of dialogue surrounded by 5-10 minute dancing segments. Yes, this is one of those nudie cuties I was talking about earlier. These movies were made to titillate as much as could be done back in the sixties. Considered an early form of pornography, which they were, they offered men of the time a chance to watch bare breasted babes au natural. One can imagine this movie playing in some lodge where a group of smiling guys sit and smoke cigars and drink whiskey while watching.

If you're a fan of the genre or of Ed Wood then youll want to add this one to your collection. Its been available in various formats for years but most of those have been terrible prints either cut to pieces, out of focus or in some other way a terrible print. Vinegar Syndrome has once more come to the rescue of a movie that some might not consider worth saving but that actually deserves to be preserved as a piece of film history.

To start with theyve remastered the film from an original 35mm camera negative to a 2k format giving us the most perfect picture this film has ever had. In addition to that the release has a number of extras including a commentary track with Ed Wood biographer Rudolph Grey and film maker Frank Henenlotter, Impressions of Nadejda an interview with actress/dancer Nadejda Dobrev, Orgy of the Ted an interview with Ted V. Mikels, a still gallery and reversible cover art.

Vinegar Syndrome has been trying to capture a time in history and the films of that time period in restored editions for a while now and they're one of the better companies doing so. The time and care theyve put into a film like this shows their interested in not just making a buck but in providing the best representations of the films they have the rights to as possible.

(Stripper in wedding dress outfit proceeds to dance seductively and strip for a medical skeleton display that you'd find in a High School human Biology Class.)

7806748,5,6300230066,"Oh, boy.  This is gonna be tough.  How does one review such a masterpiece of Schlock Cinema? This so-called ""movie"" has rendered me all but incapable of speech.  Forgive my poor efforts, as I attempt to describe the indescribable.

Contrary to popular belief, this ""movie"" (*guffaw*) does have a plot.  It would seem that every night of the full moon, the Emperor of the Night (Criswell), and his consort/co-ruler Ghoulita (aka The Black Ghoul, aka The Ghoulish Goddess of the Dancing Dead, played by Fawn Silver), appear in a certain graveyard to judge the souls of recently deceased, and morally bankrupt women.  In this task, they are assisted by their two henchmen, the ""Keepers of the Damned,"" the Mummy and the Wolf Man. The ladies must...uh...""dance"" for the Emperor. If a particular dancer pleases him, she is spared, for the time being.  If a dance does NOT please the Emperor, the unfortunate soul suffers some form of punishment, such as happens with the ""Gold Girl.""  Dancers who REALLY please the Emperor may join in the festivities as one of the judges.  Mere mortals who intrude are sentenced to become part of the ritual.  It's the Circle of Life, Simba!  But the fun only lasts until the first rays of dawn, which forces the Emperor and his minions to return to the dark depths whence they came.

Confused?  No worries.  None of that crap matters.

Imagine if Hammer Film had hired Russ Meyer to direct a screenplay written by Ed Wood.  The result would have been something very close to ""Orgy of the Dead.""  Having never been a fan of sexploitation films, and seeing the prices for this DVD, I was leery of buying it.  However, being curious about Ed Wood's work, I decided to take a chance, and bought a used copy for $35.  It was worth every penny.  Yes, it's horrible.  It's also incredibly funny and entertaining, more so than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-From-Outer-Space-Blu-ray/dp/B006ZUMOX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 From Outer Space [Blu-ray</a>]. Even the dances that aren't erotic are hilarious.  I didn't time them, but I'd estimate that they average about 5 minutes each.  All the dancers wear G-strings, for which I am eternally grateful.  Standards of personal grooming were much different in 1965 than they are today.  To paraphrase Larry the Cable Guy, I wouldn't want to see anything that looked like it belonged at a ZZ Top concert.

A/V quality of this 4x3 transfer is pretty good, considering the source material.  You will notice some print damage throughout, as well as some audio hiss during the more quiet scenes.  But at no time do they become distracting.  There were only two minor disappointments.  Given that most of the dancers were strippers recruited from local clubs, I was hoping for at least one tassel trick; there weren't any.  And while Fawn Silver (as the Black Ghoul) does do a very brief dance, she never disrobes.  The disc has two special features: a theatrical trailer, with the same A/V quality as the film; and an interview with the director, Stephen Apostolof.  It was a bit difficult to understand, given his thick accent, but still interesting.  He provides some great anecdotes not only about ""Orgy of the Dead,"" but filmmaking, Hollywood in general, and Ed Wood himself.  It's about 20 minutes.

Ed Wood was the master.  Only he could have written dialogue such as this:

(Bob and Shirley, spying on the Dance of the Dead)
Shirley: ""Could it be some kind of college initiation?""
Bob: ""It's an initiation, all right, but not of a college as you and I know it.  Nothing alive looks like that.""
Shirley: ""Can't we get out of here?""
Bob: ""I'm not sure.""
Shirley: ""What do you mean?""
Bob: ""I'm not sure, myself.""

Or this:

(This occurs just after the ""Fluff Dance"")
Emperor (to Shirley): ""Have you not enjoyed the evening's festivities?""
(Shirley grimaces)
Emperor: ""Ah, that will soon change when you become one of us.""
Wolf Man: ""WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!""
Emperor: ""It would seem that the Wolf Man would have you for his own!""
Shirley: ""AAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!""
Emperor: ""I have promised both the Wolf Man and the Mummy a reward. It could be that YOU are that reward!""
Shirley: ""AAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!!""
Emperor: ""You need not worry. Not just now, anyway.""

Or this:

Mummy (talking about Shirley to the Wolf Man): ""I would make her another Cleopatra!""
Wolf Man: ""Arrrr-harr-haaaarrr!""
Mummy: ""Without the snake, of course.""
