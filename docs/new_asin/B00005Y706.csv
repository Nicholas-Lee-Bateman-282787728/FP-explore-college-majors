7956671,3,B00005Y706,"If you're looking for the movie with Gabriel Byrne and Amanda Donohoe, this is not it. Low budget production soft porn crime melodrama. I don't think the script is as bad as the other reviewer has described. Just when you think you're going to a real groaner of a clich the next line is better than you thought it would be. The actors aren't horrible, either.  This was probably shot in a week in real locations, so you get what you pay for. I've heard worse dialogue and seen worse acting in big-budget major releases.  Still, the other reviewer is right about the packaging - the front of the DVD even has a photo of Sadie Frost from the Byrne/ Donohoe film.  Sadie Frost is not on this DVD.",1442707200,,693,4.3565891472868215
7956672,1,B00005Y706,"This is probably not the worst attempt at an erotic thriller by porn folks, but it's closer to it than not.  I must admit that I'd put it in a stack in my ""cart"" thinking to look at it more closely to see if it was a gray-market dvd of the OP Amanda Donohoe/Gabriel Byrne film (a potential confusion I suspect the packagers hope might occur, since they list no credits in the entries in this and other online dealer catalogs), then forgot it was in the stack when I checked out. Inexpensive enough so as to make it not really worth the effort to return, I decided to give it a spin and see if it would suprise me. Samantha Deane acts at times up to pro standards, in other scenes lives down to the quality of the rest of the production, particularly the script. A few of the others give almost acceptable performances.  The women involved are at least reasonably attractive, but even by the standards of softcore cable or direct to video fare, this is dull as both crime drama and erotica.",1280188800,,989,4.34054054054054
