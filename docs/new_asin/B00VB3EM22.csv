In my opinion for the directors of these movies, either you make a porn movie, or a comedy movie. because both directors failed to bring stories, or laughs, or any excitement, and the camera kept moving fast from a set to another fast enough that you do not know what a hell is going on. Also the second movie had fat, ugly, and old stars. I do not understand where they found these people, and put them on the silver screen to act. You want my advice save your money",1431216000,8,504,4.153061224489796
