1386579,5,B000050XZY,"Anyone interested in ancient Hebrew history from Palestine through Iran to Central Asia should see this documentary.  The director has travelled widely to collect footage of evidence of ancient Jewish presence in places like western China, Uzbekistan, Tunisia, and Afghanistan (where he and his crew probably risked bullets to do the investigation and interviews). Using his Jewish heritage, he explains with a combination of cultural knowledge, filmed texts on rocks, interviews with tribal elders, and an entertaining enthusiasm how each of the communities he identified might have originated from the ten lost Israelite tribes.",1042329600,4,630,5.702127659574468
1386580,4,B000050XZY,"This is a well researched and nicely produced documentary.  Due to time limitations, and its broad subject, it lacks some scholarly depth.  I could have done without the sensationalistic ""end of days"" stuff and the spooky music - at times it was reminiscent of the old ""In Search Of"" show with Leonard Nimoy.  Nevertheless, the scholarship seems solid and the conclusions range from the merely interesting to the truly amazing (and maybe a little disconcerting).
Definitely worth a viewing.",1032652800,23,490,5.177215189873418
1386581,5,B000050XZY,"This is a fascinating film that I ordered from A&E after catching a portion of it on their classroom series.  I have never ordered a video from television before but I had to have it to see the begining and review what I had all ready seen.
Not only is the material and it's implications staggering but they are presented in a compeling format.  If Indiana Jones had made a documentary...it would have looked like this.  Producer Simcha Jacobovici is charismatic as the narrator but more importantly he asks questions that carefully lead you through the reasoning that proves his research to be one of the most important finds in civilization.  When we discover that the lost tribes of Israel have all been living in the ways of their fore fathers for nearly 3,000 years we see that the characters who will fullfill the ancient prophesies of the bible have been carefully kept waiting in the wings....there is no way that this could be possible except divine intervention.
From the fundamentalist muslim guide who, with tears in his eyes says: ""Then you are my brother"" in reply to discovering the reporter of the film is a jew in Muslim territory, to the unveiling of the most ancient continuous civilization of the world as the group of ancestral priests who continue their practices waiting to usher in the activities of the new temple of the Messianic era, you will be amazed that the ancient book of the bible is not a myth but a mystery unfolding revelation to us today.
If you have any interest in religion, history or the meaning of life you might find proof here that will change your life.",1010016000,44,1599,4.659574468085107
1386582,5,B000050XZY,"Not a basketful of unsupported and outrageous claims, but Biblically based assertions that the orator acknowledges may not be the only explanation.  A person can follow along in the Old Testament and cross-reference with secular history documents, to see that there are spine-tingling correlations here, especially with regard to members of the lost tribes returning to Israel as foretold in prophecy as a prelude to end-time events.  Are all the assertions correct?  Maybe, maybe not.  But this video is worth your time and research if you are a student of Biblical prophecy.  May YHWH bless you.",982281600,12,597,5.177083333333333
1386583,5,B000050XZY,"Jacobovici has done excellent work here.  I've watched the long program a number of times, having taped it on the night it premiered.  It aired many times, mostly late at night, and has not received the attention it deserves.  This documentary takes the viewer to many unusual and some dangerous places, and builds a circumstantial but convincing case.
The subsequent discovery of Y-chromosome markers on traditional descendants of the Aaronite priesthood places the search for the Diaspora descendants into the realm of science.  Regardless of the correct identification of each given tribe, Jacobovici's videos are well worth owning and viewing.
The single and very minor criticism I have is the couple of somewhat sensationalist references to the possibility that we live in the end times, but that is not the primary focus of the video.",979257600,10,840,5.2

1386592,5,B000050XZY,"I remember seeing this when it originally aired the week of Easter 2000 on A&E. I was astounded!  Simcha Jacobovici makes a near world-wide search for the ten so-called ""Missing Tribes "" of Israel. He searches throughout the Middle East and Central Asia, North and East Africa, India and Asia to find evidence for the missing tribes. I don't recall offhand his search among the American Indians though. He claims to find evidence and surviving remnants for nine of the ten tribes,except for the Tribe of Asher.  He claimed to have found a surviving remnant of the Tribe of Dan in Ethiopia. Apparently he didn't go deeper into Africa. A documentary from Nova on P.B.S. ""The Lost Tribes of Israel"", look at evidence, genetic,genealogical,and historic to prove the Lemba people of Zimbabwe and South Africa have a claim as descendants of the Tribe of Asher.  He found evidence in India, Pakistan,Afghanistan and Uzbekistan for most of the lost tribes and in place of Asher he found on a small island off the coast of Tunisia a community of Levites  who have maintained their ritual purity to serve in the Temple in Jerusalem if it were rebuilt. Overall a unique and outstanding documentary on the people and tribes of Israel.",1463702400,5,1222,4.832535885167464

1386613,5,B000050XZY,"Biblical archaeology is life-long avocation and interest.  Also greatly enjoy the controversies that arise in the pursuit of facts and evidence, and the challenges that are thrown at new ideas.  Many of those challenges turn out to be defensive utterances along the lines of those against Galileo and Alfred Wegener, the latter who conceived the theory of continental drift.

Best description is from Scientist-dot-org: ""The reaction to Alfred Wegener's Continental Drift Theory demonstrates that new ideas threaten the establishment, regardless of the century.  Alfred Wegener was the scientist who proposed the Continental Drift Theory in the early twentieth century... Since his ideas challenged scientists in geology, geophysics, zoogeography and paleontology, it demonstrates the reactions of different communities of scientists. These reactions eventually shut down serious discussion of the concept...One of Alfred Wegener's critics, the geologist R. Thomas Chamberlain, suggested just that : ""If we are to believe in Wegener's hypothesis we must forget everything which has been learned in the past 70 years and start all over again.""

Unwittingly, the closed-mind Chamberlain was right... in the same way that a broken clock is right, twice a day.

Simcha Jacobovici is one of those supposedly ""non-accredited"" (i.e., no Ph. D.) experts whom the Ph. D.s love to ridicule and criticize, thinking they do it with impunity.  Most of the critics are driven by economic and popularity jealousy.  Many of those critical academics are also aggravated by all the archaeological and artifact discoveries made over the decades by NON-academics, which happens worldwide.  For example, in Italy a rural owner of a small house on a larger lot begins to dig for an expanded foundation to add rooms to the house and falls into an ancient tomb with decorated ""mausoleum"" walls... and no one -- including local Ph. D.s -- had any idea the tomb was there.

Believe his speculations, theories and conclusions or not, Simcha Jacobovici's persona, personality and achievements over the decades have compelled people worldwide who love archaeology's science and intrigues -- academics, professionals and amateurs -- to THINK new and exciting possibilities about ancient peoples and how they influenced the development of modern societies.  Learning from Simcha never challenges any faith; it always stimulates the intellect.",1426377600,5,2411,5.5422343324250685

Long gone are the dry and dusty ""official"" stories - new discoveries made in the last few decades are providing copious lost details about the past - answering some questions & creating a plethora of new ones.  This documentary is extremely interesting and well researched.  While Jacobovici's thesis can't really be proved, much of the ancient past has been lost in various ways.  The ""circumstantial"" evidence is quite compelling; as a Jew, I have always been curious about the Ten Lost Tribes, as well as the mystery of the Holy Grail (and what that might really be...).  Really great documentary - interesting and informative.  His documentary on the Exodus is also fantastic.",1402531200,,790,4.99236641221374
1386632,5,B000050XZY,"Simcha annoys me when he (a non-Christiab) attempts historical revision on Christian history, but in Quest for Lost Tribes, he is in his element.  His presentation of the topic is both original (at least to me) and heart-felt.

The premise, based on Jewish end-times prophecy, is that the lost tribes of Israel, scattered to the wind in diaspora, will be gathered back into the ancient homeland of Israel.  Simcha has gone in search of these, finding them in such far-flung locations  as Ethiopia, the mountains of SE Asia and India, the wild boarder area of Pakistan, etc,  Different races, all descendants of the various lost tribes (which he names one by one as he encounters them).  He finds and talks to them all, wherever he finds them, hears of their yearning to be home in Israel.  I am not an archeologist, but his premise is fascinating and the way he presents it makes sense.  I lent my first copy of this to a friend and never got it back, so I bought a new one.",1401840000,,974,4.525714285714286

1386634,4,B000050XZY,I chose this rating because there were a few areas that he was vague on his descriptions as to what they found. But is was easy to see that a lot of time was spent on research to put together this documentary. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to have a better understanding of the subject of the lost tribes of Israel. I will be recommending it to my friends. It was very interesting to see where people who were not told that they could be from these tribes were taught the same values as Israel and performing the same rituals as Israel even though they had nothing to do with Israel. I enjoyed the DVD.,1397520000,,620,4.218487394957983
1386635,5,B000050XZY,"I am such a fan of Simcha that I will watch anything he does, but I found this film to be particularly fascinating. I was completely convinced by the end of the film that all the tribes are accounted for!",1395619200,,204,4.125

However, this DVD took a different tack on the story of the Assyrian abdustion of the Children of Istael. This DVD searches for the Ten Tribes plus half the tribe of Daniel and half the tribe of Levi that had not foresaken The One True God before the abduction by Assyraia and did not forget who they were, even after they were uprooted from the Northern nation of Israel. They had kept the laws and traditions of the Children of Israel, worshipping The One True God, no matter where they landed in Asia, or, in one case, the Mediterranean, and identified with the exact tribe their forefathers had descended from. This DVD followed the Bible exactly, plus geography, history, Anthropoly and ethnic survival. It is well worth viewing by both Biblical scholars and the layman alike. Both will learn from it and whether Christian, Muslim, or Children of Israel, they will be blessed by the story. Those of no particular religious background will find the research and story intriguing and delightful as well. I highly recommend this DVD to all interested in History, Anthropolgy, Bible History or the Story of the Children of Israel.",1306108800,2,1380,4.802521008403361

In the book of Jeremiah, 16:16
""Behold, I am going to send for many fishermen,"" declares the LORD, ""and they will fish for them; and afterwards I shall send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill, and from the clefts of the rocks.
So it may not be an exact fulfillment of the scripture, since that says many hunters, but I though it was a good start.",1299283200,2,446,4.258823529411765

1386652,5,B000050XZY,"Simcha Jacobovici takes us on a fascinating journey along the most treacherous road on the planet to uncover remnants of Jewish tribes that many historians, both Jewish and non-Jewish, had thought have completely assimilated into their surrounding cultures.  The Northern Kingdom of Israel had been destroyed by the Assyrians ca. 722 BCE and the people from those tribes were dispersed throughout Asia; i.e., the tribes settled along the Silk Road from what is now the Afghanistan and Pakistan border to the eastern border between India and Burma. The exile of these tribes is captured on Assyrian stone reliefs. What Jacobovici discovers is astonishing.  I was fascinated that the physical features of these widely dispersed people is identical to the features of the population among whom they dwell, whether they be Indian, Arab, Chinese (or in the case of the Ethiopian Jews, apparently descended from the tribe of Dan, African). Jacobovici's first stop is in Manipur, India. He meets with Indians who claim descent from the tribe of Menasseh and who are persecuted by their neighbors.  The Menasseh, however, greatly admire the Israelis, and have acquired a sense of pride and a willingness to actively fight their enemies in self-defense. Many have undergone conversion and are now Orthodox Jews. Some of them have made Aliyah to Israel. Jacobovici then travels back along the Silk Road and meets with descendants of the tribes of Issachar and Naphthali who still observe ancient Jewish practices in Bukhara, Uzbekistan. Continuing his journey further to the most dangerous region, he learns that the Pathan (or Pashtun) Muslim tribes that live along the Afghanistan/Pakistan border are outwardly strict and zealous Muslims (the treatment of Muslim men toward their women is very disturbing) but still observe many Jewish rituals, such as wearing tallesim (prayer shawls) and lighting oil lamps (not Shabbat candles) before sundown on Fridays. Moses is a revered figure among them. He finds Pathan sub-tribes with names such as ""Rubeni"", ""Gadi"", ""Simoni"" and ""Ephremi"". Returning to India and the city of Mumbai (formerly Bombay), he discovers remnants of the tribe of Zevulun. The only tribe Jacobovici cannot locate is Asher.  The question Jacobovici raises is whether all of these dispersed peoples will return to the land of Israel at some point and thus usher in the Messianic age, in accordance with statements of various Jewish prophets. According to Biblical prophecy, the Messiah is supposed to be an offshoot from the seed of King David.  I wouldn't worry about it.  The Talmud says that if a man is planting a tree and someone comes up to him and announces, ""The Messiah is here!"", the man should just continue planting the tree. So to all who have read my review, just keep your day job. :-)",1271548800,14,2809,5.122270742358078

1386656,4,B000050XZY,"If you are interested in the future of Israel and that of the Jewish people; you will find this DVD `very' interesting. Both Jew (Simcha Jacobovici; the director is Jewish) and Christian can see the evidence of `possible' prophecy being fulfilled in our lifetime; that is `if' what Mr. Jacobovici says is true. Even the state of Israel believes that some of the lost tribes (the most famous of that being Dan - found in of all places Uganda) having already come back; Also Manasseh came back in 2007 (being found in of all places (northeast India).
 Jacobovici travels to many remote areas to search for missing links to the 10 Lost Tribes - if nothing else this is a good travel log film. As for me (I'm an evangelical Christian) I think Mr. Jacobovici's hypothesis is fairly solid although not as of yet proven. To bad that Mr. Jacobovici lent his name to the ""Tomb of Jesus"" debacle - which at best is a theory with even less evidence to back it up than the ""Quest for the ten lost tribes.""",1183766400,20,993,4.456043956043956
1386657,5,B000050XZY,"There are two kinds of people in the world; those who believe in the literal gathering of Israel and those who don't.  And there is a third group too -- those who have never even heard of the concept.  Regardless which camp you find yourself in, this documentary is enlightening and makes a compelling case that a literal gathering of the tribes of Israel is occurring today, and that the result of this gathering of Abraham's posterity will trigger end-time apocalyptic events on earth.  Historians and bible students both agree that when the Northern Kingdom of Israel was defeated by Assyria that thousands, or perhaps millions of people were deported, relocated and then lost to history.  But the question has always been, ""Where did they go?""

Quest for the Lost Tribes is one explanation of where some of them are today.  The film suggests that many of these people are returning to Israel and reconnecting their ancient families to the homeland.  Not everyone will agree with the conclusions Jacobovici draws in his lengthy documentary but no one can deny that his film is fascinating to watch.  The nearly two hour story takes viewers from Africa to India and many parts in between, giving examples and plausible explanations on the whereabouts of the Ten Tribes. Jacobovici interviews dozens of people who have unique connections to Hebrew roots. While he unravels many questions about the gathering of Israel from a Jewish perspective, his work raises many more.

As one who has always taken a deeply religious approach to this subject, I enjoyed watching this film very much.  Nothing that Jacobovici reveals precludes any of my own religious views on the scattering and gathering phenomenon but rather helps me broaden my own outlook on this vast and intriguing subject.  The scattering of Israel is obviously more grand and extensive than I ever realized, and I appreciate the fact that Quest for the Lost Tribes opened my mind to many new facets on this stimulating subject.",1168128000,2,1988,4.957831325301205

It will peak your interest and challenge your intellect.  Make sure you set aside some time to watch the video more than once in order to fully grasp and understand the entirety of the message.

Perhaps, I think those who would appreciate the documentary most are biblical scholars specializing in the end times and the restoration of the lost tribes to Israel. For those of us who do not fit in that category it can be difficult to follow at times.",1127001600,4,616,4.783018867924528
1386659,5,B000050XZY,"This film is one of my all time favorite biblical, lost tribe, trying to make sence out of ancient history films. The only regret I had after watching it was that it wasn't a seven episode series like the John Romer classic series Testament. I don't subscribe to everything that Jacobovici states but he does introduce his viewers to posibilities, and he is highly entertaining in an Indiana Jones like way. Its good clean speculation, adventure, and inclusion in an other wise sometimes nasty, boring, and exclusionary world.",1081987200,3,526,4.988636363636363
1386660,1,B000050XZY,"Unfortunately, I am burdened with the same kind of background (PhD in Ancient History, Hebrew, Archaeology) as the scholars Jacobovici includes in his film.  Like them, I am not impressed.  This film combines the obvious (the presence of old Jewish communities in the Middle East) with the fantastic (string together a few linguistic and cultural correlations and sell it like snake oil).  Bold assertions often turn out to be stretched (e.g. the presence of Aramaic documents proves Hebrew provenance), while connecting the dots in the author's trail of evidence requires far more than simply faith.  Something closer to credulity.
  Much of the film is simply fascinating showmanship, with an apocalyptic end-times aura. Unfortunately, the naive viewer won't realise that a good bit is also old news, stuff that can be found in any history of Jewish life.  But, whether old news or fanciful speculation, it is all presented in the same wide-eyed 'Wow, they never told you this, did they?' style that seems to characterise this showman cum director.
  Sorry to be so negative, but Jacobovici seems part Gary, Indiana's Music Man and part kosher Elmer Gantry?",1044835200,14,1159,5.1550802139037435
