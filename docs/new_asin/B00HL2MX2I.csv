6167492,5,B00HL2MX2I,Green with Evil 5 part mini series in season 1 of Mighty Morphin was  JDF's debut. Lost Green Ranger Powers that sucked! But Overwhelming Fan Outcry had them rethink it and they braught JDF Back Green temporarily and then made him White had awesome sword named Simba that talked. Tiger zord sucked an white ranger look like a kkk member wich Was not cool. Then  Zeo Red 5 wich was cool. Turbo Mostly Sucked but Red Tommy and Green Adam an Kat pink was cool. Then they left when zordon and alpha 5 did. Why? Now he returns in Dino thunder as mentor an Black Ranger. Hope he returns again maybe as Blue or Gold in season 24 or 25,1439683200,,627,4.216666666666667

6167502,5,B00HL2MX2I,"Though MMPR and Time Force usually get more praise from the fanbase, this IMHO is the best Power Rangers series. Tommy returns as mentor and meets his past in a classic episode, confronting all his past Ranger identities (green, white, Zeo V and Turbo red). The acting is not perfect but above average with a decent villian for once, the CGI Zords are fun (once you get used to them), and the pace and action are nonstop from beginning to end. There is also a great recap of the past 11 years for newer fans (Legacy of Power). And hello... dinosaurs? Recommended!",1488153600,,563,4.529411764705882
