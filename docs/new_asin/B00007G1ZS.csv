1809810,5,B00007G1ZS,"An addendum: this DVD contains my favorite ""Silly Songs with Larry"" song: the Song of the Cebu'.  The whole thing is just hilarious and the tune is very catchy. Just try to sit still when you're watching it on tv or listening to the CD! :)",1051747200,7,239,4.195652173913044
1809811,4,B00007G1ZS,"This is the first full VeggieTales video that I have watched.  I've been hearing about it quite a bit from some friends and it was very big in college (I went to a Christian college).  I decided to finally give it a look.  It's cute.  I'm glad that there is something that is intelligent, funny, and gives the message of Christ to kids all the while being a well-done program.  This DVD is three stories.  Daniel and the Lion's Den, David and Goliath, and Esther.  Having animated vegetables telling Bible stories is a cute and surprisingly effective way to communicate the biblical lessons to children.",1047427200,18,603,4.685714285714286

1809813,4,B00007G1ZS,"Dave and the Giant Pickle - 5/5 One of those veggietales that you think to yourself, ""When will this be on DVD?""

Esther, the Girl Who Became Queen - 2.5/5 Not my favorite episode, but it has its moments.

Daniel and the Lions Den - 4/5 It has a few great musical performances and conversations.

This VeggieTales compilation has two thirty-minute episodes (Dave and Esther) and one fifteen-minute episode (Daniel), but for the price, you're paying only a little bit more for a running time more than twice as long. This collection provides good bang for your buck, and is a lot of fun!",1038268800,36,586,4.615384615384615

The tales are spun to be entertaining to children and adults alike.",1386547200,,251,5.631578947368421
1809850,5,B00007G1ZS,"Our family likes VeggieTales.  The humor entertains my children and my husband!  I prefer biblical stories because they do a great job of bringing down to a level young children can understand, while also being authentic and accurate to the story in the bible so the older kids aren't pointing out all the flaws.  David and Goliath is one of the earlier shows they made.  But it is still entertaining.  The songs are catchy and of course the story is great.  Esther is an amazing story and one that VeggieTales did a great job with.  They got all the details right, but didn't overally scare the kids.  I loved the mafia/Brookly accent of the narrator.  The kids don't get it, but it tickles their Dad and me.  My daughter fell in love with story of Esther and this telling does it justice.  It did not disappoint.  Again, we all sing the songs and the message comes loud and clear.  I am so happy VeggieTales did this story because too often Queen Esther gets overlooked for children's stories from the bible.  Last, there is Daniel and the Lion's Den.  Daniel's voice is a little annoying, but again I think it is an earlier show.  The kids enjoy the story very much and talk about it a lot.

So for the price of one DVD you get 3 of the best shows VeggieTales has made.  You won't be disappointed.",1380412800,,1300,4.413502109704641

He loves veggie tales as much as Elmo.  The stories are well thought and are built on biblical stories and good morals.  These movies are meant to plant the ideas and hold the child's entertainment, not to strictly educate you on bible stories.

1809861,2,B00007G1ZS,"First of all, we love VeggieTales!  However, the picture quality on this DVD is terrible.  It actually appears that the DVD was created by recording from a VHS.  Do you remember how little white lines appeared when your tape was having ""tracking"" issues?  This DVD has those too!  Thanks for the blast of nostalgia, but I'm a little concerned that this is a pirated copy of Veggie Tales.",1345420800,,387,4.632352941176471

1809864,5,B00007G1ZS,"The video came earlier than I expected, it was in excellent condition and it's of course one of my favorites. If you like Veggie Tales this is a must have. Very inexpensive considering it has three episodes, and it has three great episodes at that. Highly recommend.",1327363200,,266,4.680851063829787
1809865,5,B00007G1ZS,"My granddaugther accidently broke the copy of the DVD that I had, but she enjoyed it soooo much that I just had to replace it for her for Christmas.

1809870,5,B00007G1ZS,"I love Daniel and the Lion's den.  You have to appreciate the artistic detail of chives dancing and singing across a checkered board palace floor as they plot against Daniel.  I wanted to have something here to entertain young visitors; but truthfully, I enjoy this video myself.  The difference between these updated CD's verses the VCR versions is that they added excerpts of very young children talking about the stories. In my opinion, they could have left this out and just stick with the veggie tale characters. The other stories are David and Goliath and Queen Ester. I have had several veggie VCR's and have other veggie CD's.  This one is my all time favorite.",1309737600,,669,4.791304347826087

1809875,5,B00007G1ZS,"Most people buying this already own or have watched the Veggie tales on an old VCR tape or DVD, but what is really interesting is how much our kids love the interludes of the other kids in the video.
It just sets them off in giggles and asking about how they could do something on TV. So I would suggest not skipping them and seeing how your kids react.",1247788800,,353,4.130434782608695

Featuring stories about Daniel in the Lion's Den, David and Goliath, and Queen Esther, its over an hour in length and really brings out the heroics of some of the best stories in the old testament. My little boy loves the ""Dave and the Giant Pickle"" story and at age 2 could retell the exciting story of how Dave jumped up and said ""I will fight you!"" My little girl started really getting into her Toddler Bible after watching this several times because suddenly the stories were coming alive for her. For a while her most requested story was not about Disney princesses but Queen Esther.

The Queen Esther story in particular has a great message about a girl who was always afraid until she trusted God. The courage song that she sings several times became one of my kids' anthems whenever they needed a shot of courage and really brought home the message that God keeps us safe if we just trust Him.",1200614400,3,926,4.479289940828402

1809891,5,B00007G1ZS,"This is the first ""actual"" VeggieTales film I've watched.  I watch their Silly Soung Coundown, and both my four-month-old and I enjoy the silly characters, silly music, and all-around silliness.  Once I knew that he wouldn't be afraid of the giant pickle or the pirates who don't do anything, I decided to try Heroes of the Bible.  This DVD has three short stories, Daniel and the Lions Den, Dave and the Giant Pickle (Goliath), and Esther, the Girl Who Became Queen.
This DVD (or perhaps all VeggieTales movies, since I'm not the VT expert, yet) reminded me a lot of the Simpsons -- of course in a very different way than what may come to mind when one mentiones the Simpsons.  I'm not talking about the constant strangling your child by his neck type of ""silliness"".  Rather, the Simpsons use such a type of humor that it attracts viewers of all ages and the humor is not lost is a viewer doesn't see or doesn't understand the other levels of humor.  I'll explain . . .
My four-month-old enjoyed Daniel and the Lions Den -- the colors, movements, and songs.  He laughed at the king's wisemen (slippery scallions) in their plotting to kill Daniel.  Obviously, my son doesn't understand the plotting, but he sees the funny scallions and song exchanges between the wisemen, the king, and Daniel.  An older child would understand that the wiseman are trying to kill Daniel and that, instead of killing Daniel, the lions actually became his friends.  And my husband and I like the part when Daniel is leaving the lions den and yells down to the lions, ""thanks for the pizza!""",1056758400,18,1572,4.64259927797834

7976343,1,B00007G1ZS,"Poor quality!!!! Looks like they just ripped off an old VHS and put it on DVD. The animation is grainy and there are white spots at the bottom of the screen that you only see on crappy VHS. Very disappointed. Additionally, this same DVD is only $9.99 if you buy it directly from Veggie Tales. What a rip off!!",1496534400,,309,4.254237288135593
