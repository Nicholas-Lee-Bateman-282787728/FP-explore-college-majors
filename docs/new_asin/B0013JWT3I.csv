8251352,5,B0013JWT3I,"I am a wounded American combat soldier, and so my view of war films may be different from that of the other reviewers.  Unlike them, I didn't find this to be overly long, and I found no great fault with the combat sequences (although some were from 1945-vintage newsreels, and were thus ""grainy"").

The perspective of this film was priceless!  I understand the empty, extremely introspective feeling of preparing to enter combat - but doing so with the deliberate intention of dying (indeed for the actual PURPOSE of dying) is surely a very large step beyond anything that I ever considered/encountered as an American combat soldier.  I believe that those feelings were well portrayed here, within the Japanese cultural context (to the limited extent that I understand that).  And surely the contemporary Japanese civilians' attitudes toward the (soon-to-be-dead) kamikazis portrayed here were far, far beyond the now-common American ""Thank you for your Service!"", in this case: ""Thank you for dying for our 'national identity'!""  (Perhaps the racial near-homogeneity of the Japanese can allow some allegiances beyond those of more racially heterogenous Americans?)

But having written this, as all of the other reviewers have noted, it is true that this film does leave two issues unresolved:  1. Japan's responsibility for initiating what all other countries on the Pacific rim consider to have been an unprovoked war of aggression; and 2. Japan's long-continued honoring of convicted and executed war criminals found responsible for indisputably heinous acts or decisions.  And it is also clearly true that this film will not help the Japanese to accept that their countrymen were responsible for very well documented massacres, genocide, torture and execution of POWs, Unit 731's always-lethal medical experimentation (including vivisection) on non-Japanese captives, and many instances of the most grotesque racism - issues at the forefront of current Korean and Chinese concerns.  And, most unfortunately, the film will no doubt encourage some Japanese to continue an attitude of victimization instead of accepting that their forebears were the enthusaistic perpetrators of genocidal racism.  This film ennobles that same military.

But these same men did face a moral conundrum worthy of full-length film explication, justifying what others have called a slow-moving film.  Strategically, the Japanese miscalculated badly, through cultural ignorance: the casualties inflicted by the kamikazis (34 ships sunk, some 4,900 primarily-Americans killed, and another 4,800 wounded, compared to some 3,860 kamikazi fliers killed) did not save Japan from anything; they simply forced President Truman to order the release the atomic bombs on Japan, concluding that an invasion of Japan would likely result in a million American casualties otherwise, if the Japanese could be so recklessly suicidal.  And, ironically, it is thus probable that the kamikazis unwittingly spared these American casualties, by condemning Japan to a nuclear attack that may not otherwise have happened.  The kamikazis thus indirectly caused the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings (which killed some 130,000-250,000 Japanese), both cities having been legitimate military targets with large military presences (about 50,000 troops) and significant defense industries.

But why should a particular film be judged as deficient on the basis of not having resolved all associated questions?  This film succeeds at presenting to outsiders, in a coherent and culturally consistent  manner, the contemporary attitudes of the Japanese military and civilians regarding the kamikazes.  The film thus has great value.  It is emotionally stunning, ""eye-opening"".

This is a fine and important film, and I appreciate it because it expanded my awareness.  I will never forget it!

(But I do wish that this film had been dubbed into English!)",1427155200,,3897,5.567796610169491
8251353,3,B0013JWT3I,"I found this film quite watchable and by moments even pretty good. Below some more detailed impressions, with limited SPOILERS.

This film tells the story of the young kamikaze pilots waiting to fly their missions from an air base in Japan, in the last months of war (May-August 1945). At 2h15 minutes, it is a long film and its pace is slow, almost never accelerating. Almost all the film is devoted to the preparations and waiting for the suicide mission, with some limited action being shown (briefly and not very well by the way) just towards the end.

This film definitely shows all the horrible but also deeply moving aspects of last days of life of those young pilots, who frequently didn't really volunteer but rather were designed to fly suicide missions and felt unable to desist themselves, mostly because of the social, hierarchical and peer pressure (and also for fear of being stygmatised as cowards). Still, many of them had doubts about the sense of their sacrifice in a time when war seemed already lost. Almost all tried to show their objections and their desire to live in some indirect way which stopped just short of open refusal to fly the mission. Those internal struggles, different and personal to every pilot, are the real topic of the film. They are not always easy to watch.

This is not a bad film, but it could be better if it was shortened a little. In the second half, I started to feel tired and a little bit bored rather than moved by the accumulation of farewells, poetry, songs, ceremonies and tears - even if I knew that it was a wrong reaction... Cutting half an hour and if necessary eliminating one or two characters would do a great deal of good to this film. Also, definitely the mission scenes could be much better.

Bottom line, this is a reasonably good film, definitely well showing the last moments of life of kamikaze pilots - but still, not good enough. Japanese directors made in the past some splendid masterpieces of cinema - it is a pity, that when such an exceptionally dramatic topic was concerned, this exploit couldn't be repeated.",1360540800,,2088,4.6811989100817435
8251354,4,B0013JWT3I,"This is an incredible film from the opposing perspective.  I actually own the DVD and found it a bit better than the Men of Yamato DVD.  I think a part of it is because it's a newer release, but also the Japanese is a bit easier for me to understand.  The Kansei-ben or Kure Island talk is a bit harder to understand than regular Japanese.  It's authentic in the sense that the actors behave of the times, speak the dialect of the times, and the uniforms are accurate down to the collars.

The interesting aspect is Shintaro himself.  How does a man, a Governor write a movie script anyway?  Now the guy has literally traveled to Senkaku Islands to prove China's stance wrong.  Okinawa is where the bloody battle happened as 200,000 Okinawans died needlessly.  The Kamikaze or Flying Cherry Blossoms really took place there near the Senkaku Islands as well.  So historically the film, and real life have connections to the man.

The only thing I can say is that most of you should purchase a region 02 of the DVD.  It'll assure that the film makers get their credit or small royalty.  Film makers make so little these days.  If you own Men of Yamato, Letters from Iwo Jima, Nanjing Nanjing, and Tora Tora Tora?  Definitely add this to the collection.

It should also be noted that they painstakingly rebuilt a A6M Mitsubishi Hayabusa Zero from a Sesna Engine plane.  At least enjoy the fact that they re-created that for this film.",1341273600,,1431,4.570866141732283
8251355,4,B0013JWT3I,"This is a movie based on the recollections of a real Japanese woman, Tome Torihama, who operated a restaurant in the small town of Chiran in the southern tip of Japan.  Her restaurant became a favorite gathering place for the Japanese Army pilot trainees, and Chiran later became one of the main staging points for Japanese kamikaze missions.  Her story had previously been chronicled in no fewer than three books written by different Japanese authors.

Shintaro Ishihara wrote only the screenplay for this movie; Ishihara is an author and politician, former governor of Tokyo prefecture, and a right wing Japanese nationalist, most famous in the West for his book ""The Japan That Can Say No"".

The movie does have some scenes sure to push some hot-buttons amongst Japan's Asian neighbors and former victims, such as many references to the Yasukuni shrine to Japan's war dead (and war criminals), references to a need to defend Japan's ""national character"", and a scene where a Korean volunteers to be a kamikaze (although this was apparently a true story).

However, overall, Taku Shinjo, the movie's director, took care not to glorify either the war nor the concept of the kamikazes, and he clearly depicts the entire system of sending these young men to their deaths as a cruel and calculating process that exacted an enormous emotional price amongst the loved ones that these young men left behind.  The movie begins in 1943, when young men first began arriving in Chiran to become pilots, none of them imagining that they would be asked to become kamikaze pilots.

There is a scene from history depicting the recruitment of Captain Yushio Seki to become a kamikaze during the Battle of Leyte Gulf.  Trained as a dive bomber pilot, he reluctantly agreed to lead a flight of kamikazes, which then sank the U.S. escort carrier St. Lo.  The interesting part of the story is that Seki objected to being asked to crash into the ship, as he was one of the few remaining experienced pilots who had  the dive-bombing skills to hit the ship and then try to make a get away, but he was pressured into becoming a kamikaze.  The reason for the kamikaze program is not fully explained in the movie - it was simply that the overwhelming air supremacy of the U.S. Navy and Japan's severe losses of skilled pilots in battles such as the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot (Operation A-Go for the Japanese) meant that Japan increasingly lacked the ability to hit the U.S. Navy except by turning their inexperienced pilots into kamikazes.

The movie depicts the full cruelty of Japanese officers and the Kempetei (Japanese secret police), who were empowered to strike down with their fists any subordinate or civilian who they felt had disobeyed or failed in some way.  And it shows the internal conflicts of the kamikaze pilots, some of whom clearly wanted to go on their missions to defend their country, and others who went only because of the social pressure to do so and questioned the futility of their sacrifice.

Most of all, it is refreshing to see the entire process of the kamikazes, the support system of ground crews and young women who surrounded these men and waved them off on their final journeys, the retribution that came with failed/aborted missions, and the planes themselves, which were very well done.

The story of the kamikazes during WWII is a topic that is rarely explored in movies and so I found this a fascinating movie.

I should note that the DVD version I have is not listed on Amazon.  It is a Hong Kong product with a different cover, NTSC Region 3, with Cantonese and Japanese audio and English or Chinese subtitles.  At the moment this version is the mostly readily available DVD, easily found with an internet shopping search.",1265155200,8,3743,4.812792511700468
8251356,3,B0013JWT3I,"This is a film written by Shintaro Ishihara, the author of ""The Japan That Can Say No"" and also the Gov of Tokyo (they have a Gov, not mayor).  It is about young kamikaze pilots in the Japanese army air force, told from the point of view of the owner of a cafe near the air base.  Evidently Ishihara actually talked to this woman and based the film on her recollections.  The DVD itself is from Indonesia or Malaysia, but worked fine in my DVD player.  The film does not have much action in it and is told from a flashback perspective.  Ishihara has an agenda here, as he has the admiral in charge of the Kamikaze unit stating that Japan started the war to free the Asian peoples from white domination--this is a very questionable premise to say the least, as many Chinese, Koreans and Phillipine citizens could attest too.  There is very little action in the film, except for a couple short scenes where American planes strafe a student group, the restaurant owner is beat up by Japanese secret police and the final kamikaze scene.  Otherwise this film might be too slow paced for American viewers.  If you want a film that has more ""meat"" to it but still gives a point of view of the kamikaze, try ""Otoko Tachi No Yamato"" which in my opinion is a better film than this one.  I gave this film 3 stars because they actually built a pretty accurate Haybusa fighter with an operating engine and it is used repeatedly in the film.  Otherwise this might be a 2 star film.",1205798400,6,1467,4.4
