1805813,3,B00007CVRL,"This is a possible entry point to Miles Davis' life and creation. Historical-, social-, personal-, musical-, and all sorts of -markers are scattered throughout, at times even connected.

From a musical perspective, as others here suggest, this material comes short by not providing full(er) versions of Miles' works. Worse yet, it is the absence of most any conceptual considerations regarding Miles Davis' works that bothers your exigent documentary-viewer. For example, was he a religious man, did philosophy matter to him, what was his debt to, let's say, classical and other forms of music? We learn, in passing, from family members about his listening to Khatchaturian and French impressionists or to Flamenco music in preparation of Sketches of Spain. We also learn about his interest in painting and drawing though there is no connecting line back into/from his jazz music. Too little analysis, too many trivial facts. In other words, the viewer is left wanting to learn more about how much of Miles' creation was pure instinct vs. informed?

Oh well, most interviews were taped in 1986 (he was still alive) and he wasn't making a good interviewee either. Apparently, too little time has passed for us to comprehend Miles Davis beyond the tunes of his recorded music. It will take time, and who knows how many degrees in musicology to start figuring out the enigma behind the notes.

On a technical note, this DVD brings little in addition to the VHS version since the menu-items are few and slooow to move among.

Considering its price, this DVD could safely make do  as an introduction to Miles Davis' or as a pleasant encounter with some jazz legends of the past century.",1095984000,2,1681,4.989285714285714
1805814,3,B00007CVRL,"Problems with this documentary:

1. Should have clocked in at 4 hours - at the very least!

  6 hours might have done the man and his prodigious career

  justice.  Might have, if it was organised intelligently

  with an emphasis on THE MUSIC and how and why it was made

  rather than the dude's personal life.

2. Weighted with lots of gossipy interviews in an attempt to

  illuminate the person behind the persona. Which is fine and

  valid, as far as that sort of thing goes.  Unfortunately,

  this stunt is attempted in a suspiciously selective way:

  ex-wives, some business associates, a relative or two and

  a handful of former sideman; but either too little too often

  or too much too frequently to be fair to someone who cannot

  defend himself (not that Miles would even care to bother).

3. Likewise, plods through some relatively minor stuff that was

  obviously readily available (case in point: long segments on

  the Louis Malle score), while absurdly glossing over so many

  key periods (example: everything between Jack Johnson and

  the 1980 comeback is treated as some drug-addled aberration).

  Taken in tandem with Ken Burns' lame treatment of Miles,

  similarly stupidly dismissive of the Dark Magus period, this

  uncoolness is more than annoying - its insulting.

4. A biographer who does not seem to be at all hip. I cannot

  believe how inept his description of a saxophonist's playing

  was.  Does this guy know anything about music? Don't seem

  so. How in Gehenna did this dude ever manage to get Miles'

  confidence?

  When, oh when, will someone who REALLY digs

  Davis, in all his guises and aspects and contradictions and

  weirdness present this life the way it ought to be?!?

  Miles deserves someone hip enough to delive into the substance

  without coming across like a stuffy Oxford Don.  He deserves

  a cross between William Burroughs, Lester Bangs, Quincy Jones,

  Marcus Miller and Samuel R. Delaney to do him justice.

  Damn!  Someone should spend an hour just describing how

  He Loved Him Madly was put down!

5. So many notable recordings and concert tours and sidemen info

  are missing from this mug that it is hardly worth watching

  more than once.  Give us the Miles we really want - and need!

  And by the way SONY, where are all those unedited concerts?

  There just HAS to be tons of Miles out there somewhere.

This is great documentary film making with interviews from numerous musicians, friends, family,lovers , etc that really gets to the essence of who Miles Davis was and most importantly shows clearly the influence this man had on jazz music in the second half of the 20th century. The testimony of so many jazz greats speaks for itself. Miles Davis' life was remarkable in many aspects and is certainly deserving of this  type of treatment. I thoroughly enjoyed this and am happy to own a copy. Miles' recordings are there for the listening.

If you want to dig deeper, read his excellent auto-biography, (Miles, Simon & Schuster, available on Amazon). Ignore some of the useless bad ratings given by some individuals about this DVD: if people want to listen to Miles music, they'd better buy his albums. This documentary is about Miles' life, featuring interesting interviews with his family members, fellow musicians (from Dizzy Gillespie to John Mc Laughlin), ex-girlfriends etc. A great document.

1805820,5,B00007CVRL,"This DVD is amazing, offers an insight to Miles' career and personal life, from the people who lived and worked with him and of course from Miles himself. For all of those who might have read books on Miles' life, this DVD will not give you so much new information and facts, but what this DVD will do, is to offer you plenty of visualizations on things you might have read or heard.
This DVD though, as the title explicitly states is THE MILES DAVIS STORY and not Miles Davis Live In ...... , or whatever else, so I don't unserstand how some people were expecting live performances. This is a documentary and not a concert. What you see is what you get.
I really think that this is a great documentary, and everybody who wants to think of him/herself as a serious Jazz fan should realy own this DVD.

1805821,2,B00007CVRL,"Too much talking, too little music. This documentary is ok as an introduction to Miles Davis. But the commentator is interrupting when the music is pumping, which is f..... annoying. There is still a desperate need for a Miles Davis DVD about the period between 1969-75. Without all the talking. Just pure music without interruption.

1805822,4,B00007CVRL,"This fast-paced two-hour documentary is probably the best introduction to the life of Miles Davis available, considerably more expansive than the hour-long 1986 PBS documentary MILES AHEAD.  Nonetheless, being that this product is a companion to the 2-CD career overview ESSENTIAL MILES DAVIS, that's a warning to Davis fans not to expect too much in the way of details or extensive video footage.  STORY provides a balanced presentation of his musical and personal life, from his upbringing in East St. Louis to his death in 1991...somewhat ala Ken Burns' JAZZ series (sans Wynton Marsalis and Stanley Crouch, of course), but much more concise due to the time constraints.  Those fans who are familiar with Miles' career won't find much new here, especially if you've read John Szwed's new bio SO WHAT.  For one, Miles' succession of musical achievements are alluded to but not examined in depth.
As with Szwed's book, STORY benefits by the participation of family members, from ex-wives/partners Irene Cawthorn & Frances Davis to daughter Cheryl and youngest son Erin (who briefly joined Miles' band in 1990).  For the most part there is an uplifting sense of joy in the retracing of Miles' steps offered by both these participants and an impressive but too-short list of musicians newly interviewed (from Jimmy Cobb to Marcus Miller).  Many still-living sidepersons are conspicuous by their absence: one wonders did they decline to be interviewed...or were they not asked?  In addition, STORY lifts some interview segments from the 1984 CBS promo video, the above-mentioned PBS documentary, and other 1980s sources...so the voice of Miles and other greats who either have passed (e.g., Gil Evans, Dizzy Gillespie) or unavailable for this latest project (e.g., Keith Jarrett), are heard.
For Miles fans the big frustration will be in seeing every performance clip shown for only a few seconds before there is a voice-over or cut to the next segment.  However, in trying to cover the life of an artist who was artistically productive for most of his adult life, one has to accept that Davis' story cannot be told in two hours without moving quickly through each period of his career.  Otherwise they might as well turn it into a multi-volume project (which btw is a great idea--ala the Beatles ANTHOLOGY video).  I was disappointed that no one from Miles' last band was interviewed (except for Erin), and surprised that no mention was made of the 1991 `Miles Plays Gil"" Montreux concert (the 1991 Paris ""reunion"" show two days later IS covered), or of Davis' last ""significant other"" (Jo Gelbard).  Hopefully Legacy will soon compile a video series that presents the wealth of available video footage in an unabridged form.  For now, STORY provides a concise overview of the life of Miles Davis that touches on rather than digs into the details.",1038787200,51,2846,5.0576923076923075

It is a well produced, directed, and paced film. For years I wanted to understand why so many people revered this man and now I feel as though I have some clue as to why. It would have to be his relentless drive to reinvent himself as time marched on he ate, slept, and breathed his music mostly to the detriment to personal relationships with his family and friends. Judge for yourself but I've watched it more than once and will definitely watch again because there is so much to absorb you'll probably miss some things during the first viewing.

1805875,5,B00007CVRL,"I'm embarrassed to say that I know nearly nothing about Miles Davis, one of the most important musicians of our era, it is said, and a major cultural icon as well. So when I saw this DVD in the public library, I jumped at a chance to watch it and learn.
The story wanders through Miles Davis' life, interviewing him, his fellow musicians, biographers, ex-wives and girlfriends. It does a great story of bringing to life the musical magus as he was known and loved. We learn about his upbringing in Saint Louis, how he fathered three children while still in his teens, his musical upbringing, the throat operation that left him with a raspy voice and his first big breaks. Then there is the early first trip to Europe, where he got an enthusiastic reception and was treated as an equal. He got a scarf from a French girlfriend that he always wore. There's the anecdote about how, when he was already very famous, how he was three hours later for a concert in Venice. Facing an angry crowd that has been kept waiting a very long time, he lifted up his trumpet to play, and within 25 seconds you could hear a pin drop in the audience. Bizarre, freaky musical discipline with an eagle eye towards innovation. ""Keith, you know why I don't play ballads any more? Because I like playing ballads so much.""

Miles Davis was a good cook too, cooked up fish for Bill Evans.",1327276800,,1362,4.469879518072289
1805876,5,B00007CVRL,"I love the Miles Davis' story in book and now also in film. He had such a colorful life (ups & downs) which makes for a great story. Miles was truly BRILLIANT. And like most brilliant people they toe the line of excess and oft times cross it. Well told just like the book Miles, The Autobiography with Quincy Troupe. A MUST READ if you liked the DVD.",1303084800,,350,4.161764705882353
1805877,5,B00007CVRL,"An absolute must have if you are a fan of Miles Davis or a serious jazz fan! Miles is my favorite musician hands down. He has been since I discovered him in high school (over 40 years ago). I learned things watching this DVD that I had not known previously. Most interesting were the insights and anecdotes provided by family, colleagues and proteges. Most notably those of Francis Taylor, John McLaughlin, Joe Zawinul, Chick Corea, Ron Carter and Herbie Hancock.

Totally worth owning as you will enjoy watching it over and over as well as sharing it with friends. Even if you don't consider yourself a serious jazz fan, it will increase you appreciation of the musician(s), the genre as well as art and artists in general.",1289692800,2,724,4.700787401574803
1805878,5,B00007CVRL,"I'd like to say, the jazz person most affecting me probably is Coltrane. But then there is Miles Davis. Up to 1970 he already did so much of interest. And then there are all these other years. I'm a latecomer to the 70-90's Miles, in part because of the partial reviews. But now: ""Live around the world"" is among my top 5 Miles albums, and then there is Pangea, Agharta, Black Magus, etc. I am unpleasantly surprised at the relatively low score of this DVD--could that be due to the antagonism caused by the later output? Among the strong features of this DVD are the interviews of the mid 80's, of the man himself, but also of the mother of his first child, his first wife, and luminaries such as Marcus Miller, Mclaughlin, Liebman, Bill Evans, and let's not forget, the legend, Herbie HANCOCK, all from the mid 80's-early 90's. I'd like to have seen more of the 1st quintet and JC's part in cementing MD's stature, but then there is the 2nd quintet, and they are introduced marvelously in this CD. There are reminiscences of Ron Carter and Clark Terry (the earlier days). I very much enjoyed this documentary.

Probably misunderstood but it all envelopes him and made him the man he became. Anyone that loved Miles Davis this is a must buy to get a better understanding of why he would play live shows with his back to the audience. Clever he is in my opinion. What also blew me away is how he worked with most of the modern jazz musicians we see today such as, Marcus Miller, Herbie Hancock, John Scofield, Chick Correa, Keith Jarrett, the list goes on. Miles never ending struggle to reach new boundaries with his horn is inspiring.

1805891,4,B00007CVRL,"This is a fine biography, but like most biographys of artists it has too little of the artists work and too much focus on the people around the artist.

And in the ""You can't depend on Google"" department, the song ""Time After Time"" that Miles recorded is credited in the Amazon review to Cyndi Lauper.  She did write a song with that title, but ""Time After Time"" is a jazz standard written by Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne that first appeared in the 1947 movie ""It Happened in Brooklyn"", long before Ms Lauper was born.",1180137600,2,515,4.410526315789474
1805892,4,B00007CVRL,Rather than focus on what it is not I prefer to focus on what it is; a documentary that utilizes people from Miles Davis life and Miles himself to comment on his eclectic life. I for one found it interesting to hear his ex-wives and fellow musicians making  commentary on the lives and times of Miles. It is pretty funny listening to everyone tell stories in mock wispy Miles voice; it seems as though everyone tries to imitate his throat box whisper. The sequence of events are interesting as everyone recalls what he was like at a given point in time. Most interesting of all is Miles telling his own story as he tells little stories about different parts of his life. It is a shame there is not more music but when there is it is amazing. It is especially amazing to see the events of his life unfold in conjunction with the music. The various phases of his life are covered in depth and the pace is fast enough to keep you invloved throughout the disc. The narrative speakover is typical of documentaries in that it grabs you and demands you to pay attention. The musical snippets are brief but the story is well told. The concert material is worthwhile although not nearly long enough. The fusion period is very captivating both as a story and as performance. If you are into Miles Davis you will like having this added to your collection. It is a part of the total picture that will help make your collection complete.,1172448000,,1424,4.476923076923077

1805898,3,B00007CVRL,"Glad I decided to Netflix this instead of making it an impulse buy, because if you know at very least the basics of his work and career, you're bound to be frustrated by this by-the-numbers skip through Davis' life.

Since it just focuses on one figure, ""The Miles Davis Story"" is able to focus in on Miles with a more intense magnification than ""Ken Burns' Jazz"" was, but it sorely lacks that entity's engaging, fascinating approach.  Talking heads and short clips is the M.O. here.

It moves quickly, skipping through the high points so fast you might find it hard to believe they've said all they're going to say about ""Kind of Blue,"" ""Sketches of Spain,"" ""Bitches Brew,"" etc.  And since this is a Sony project, they give particularly short shrift to his pre-Columbia years.

Granted, it would take hours to cover all the various aspects of Miles Davis' art sufficiently and this program is merely intended to give an overview.  But watching it, I wasn't sure if a newcomer would be pulled into the documentary or if, overwhelmed by the pace and the subject, they might get a little bored.

I'll watch and, on some level, enjoy *anything* that features the music, performances and photographs of one of my favorite jazz icons, but Sony should apply the same marketing strategy they're currently employing with the Miles Davis box sets and start issuing as much live performance footage as they can on video, particularly in light of the enthusiasm of myself and the other reviewers.",1097366400,3,1485,4.8
