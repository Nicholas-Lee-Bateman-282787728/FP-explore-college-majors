8221132,3,B000W3VFDQ,"I haven't taken ballet in YEARS and thought this would be a fun way to get back into it before taking classes in a studio. I was wrong. It's a good little video, but it moves incredibly fast and doesn't teach on both sides. This video requires knowledge of different moves, as well as the ability to put multiple moves together.",1366675200,,328,4.39344262295082
8221133,4,B000W3VFDQ,"I am a beginner ballet dancer, and this video is a lot of fun! There are lots of exercises and combinations to learn, but they are suited more for intermediate/advanced dancers. There are lots of terms to know, and lots of variations between each combination. Each combination is taught by running through the steps once from the back, and is then performed with music facing the camera. It's definitely worth the effort for beginners like me, but make sure you have lots of room to dance! I'd say a large living room would be suitable.",1297555200,5,536,4.652631578947369
8221134,5,B000W3VFDQ,"This is a great instructional DVD for someone who has previous ballet experience and understands the terminology. The class is a good balance to my weekly workout!  David Howard is a master teacher and is very thorough as he explains each exercise before it's performed. I found the combinations very useful, and there's a nice variety of turn and jump variations, as well as adage and allegro work. Plus, the dancers performing them are very talented, which helps give me an idea of what the final steps should look like.",1258675200,6,522,4.8
8221135,4,B000W3VFDQ,"It is a good video, but as a adult entry level ballet dancer, it is a little bit too advanced for me.",1258070400,,101,3.6363636363636362
8221136,5,B000W3VFDQ,"A very thorough, well demonstrated ballet instructional dvd. Mr. Howard's center work is terrific and he's put down some unique and very danceable combinations in this program ! Mr. Howard explains each
combination as the demonstrators ( who are marvelous by the way) slowly
follow his instruction. This is followed by each combination performed
full out to music. There is a tremendous amount of useful material, and
it is filmed very nicely. I found it very easy to follow and Mr.
Howard's voice alone is inspiring to any dancer taking his class.",1193011200,14,548,4.967391304347826
