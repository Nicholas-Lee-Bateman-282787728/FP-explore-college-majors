8752562,5,B01C9JLZTY,"Excellent. Comprehensive and semi-intimate review of the emergence of land-art / earthworks in the 20th century. Compiled from conversations with primary and secondary sources and original photos, film and video. I found it both inspiring and edifying.

I hope its for sale at some point.

8752564,4,B01C9JLZTY,"A little old but good art history information. I used this film for one of my art history classes and it was okay, it's just a bit dated for current students as they tend to get easily bored when looking at a lot of old black and white film shots. Use of original footage is both good and bad in this respect.",1477785600,2,309,4.0
8752565,5,B01C9JLZTY,This was a fantastic movie about land art. The historical footage had great value of showing just how rebellious and fresh they were at their time.,1477612800,2,147,4.6923076923076925
