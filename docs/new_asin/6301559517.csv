One rainy afternoon, I watched it three times.  Each time I watch, I see something I may have missed.  Such a wonderful/romantic movie.  Cheryl Ladd and Stuart Wilson are superb. What a great way to meet the love of your life......on care free trip thru Europe.  Yes, definately a chick flick !!!",1343347200,2,462,4.352941176470588
334130,2,6301559517,The VHS was definitely not in like new condition and the slip case didn't even fit the tape. The quality of the tape was not very good but I can't tell if that was how it was originally released.,1308787200,,195,4.0256410256410255
334131,3,6301559517,My wife has been asking for this video since we lost the original in a break in. She is happy we didn't have to pay too much for the replacement. The only downside to this is that it is not in a DVD. Thanks anyways,1254787200,,214,3.7777777777777777
334132,5,6301559517,"I positively loved this film, for all it's joy, heartbreak and possibilities.  Cleverly told in flashbacks.  I bought a VHS copy here some years back, since unavailable in DVD, and the copy I received was lousy, a copy of a copy several times over, BUT STILL I'M GLAD TO HAVE IT FOR THOSE MOODY MOMENTS OF MINE.
IF EVER Available in DVD??? I'd buy it in a heartbeat !!!",1232496000,,369,4.333333333333333
334133,5,6301559517,"This movie took me 10 years to find. I sawit as a teenager and loved it. This story makes you feel happy, sad and full of hope that if you haven't found love you will. No matter what and how much time, love see's through it all. The actors in this movie make you feel what they feel. You understand what both are going through and how much love they have for one another. It's a tear-jerker for sure!",1198195200,4,400,4.075949367088608

7812637,3,6301559517,"The film reminds me of movie of the week for television as a Cheryl Ladd vehicle. She played Lily Parker, a New York City magazine editor. Ruby Wax played Susan, a New York City photographer. They start their journey from Venice, Italy aboard the Orient Express to Paris France. Stuart Wilson played the British suitor, Alex Woodward. They reconnect after a decade.

The film is more melodramatic though. Sir John Gielgud has a small part in the film. I enjoyed watching Ruby Wax though even as Lily's traveling companion. The sights are marvelous. Cheryl Ladd and Stuart Wilson played themselves in flashbacks. Both characters have their secrets about what went wrong.

I believe the film should also be released on DVD too whether in a compilation of other romantic films. Cheryl Ladd and Stuart Wilson delivered a believable but unlikely romance. Although the writing was probably the weakest part of the film, the sights of Paris, France and Venice, Italy more than make up for it.",1506124800,,985,4.927710843373494

7812643,4,6301559517,"I saw it on television many years ago and wanted to see it again.  I purchased this in vhs format because it was not available on dvd (probably because it is a much older movie).  VHS does not produce the best picture, but I still enjoyed seeing this movie again.",1395532800,,263,4.24
