It's intimidating to do weights on your own at the gym. So this video was perfect. I can do it in the comfort of my own home. It's 30 minutes so I can fit it in when I don't have much time.

This Nikki Fitness DVD was a great change of pace for me.  It's easy to follow, I choose my own music, and best of all IT WORKS!

Nikki manages to work all the major muscle groups in only 1/2 hour because there are no wasted moves - arms and legs are worked at the same time, legs are worked during the cardio portion, and even a bit of yoga is incorporated into the stretching.

Love it!",1206576000,3,468,4.0

This dvd has got me back into the grove of working out...why? it 30 minutes!!!!!!!!!!  who knew you could accomplish so much ,in such a short amount of time?.. and the best part!  My husband is so proud that ive found something thats given me motivation to WANT to work out, instead of complining i've put on weight!  Thats right, I WANT to work out!  Dont get me wrong, its a challanging DVD, but you can start out with a small amount of weight, and still feel it!  More over, you can keep increasing your weight as to keep challanging yourself!

It's definitely not one of those DVDs that you are counting the minutes until the agony is over. It gets your heart pumping, your muscles working, and the workout is over before you know.

I did not want to leave my baby to go to the gym, so I decided to get this DVD after seeing Nikki on Fox News. Out of all of the other workout DVDs I have done, this one is by far my favorite. Nikki is not overly peppy or annoying, and the serene lake and city backgrounds are great to watch. The workout has is 30 mins, which includes a warm-up/calm down, cardio, and toning with weights. I wouldn't call it extremely challenging, but it did leave me short of breath and feeling great afterwards. In just a few days I could feel my muscles toning and getting stronger. The video isn't high-quality by any means, but I feel good supporting a small business like Nikki's. I have found myself looking forward to doing the workout everyday, and my daughter doesn't mind since its only 30 mins of playing by herself ;) I highly recommend it to all the busy moms out there!",1360281600,,961,4.256830601092896

8256273,5,B0014TC2U2,"I LOVE this video. It's difficult enough, but not too hard for someone like me who is a little too sporadic with her workouts. For a newbie you can take breaks when needed or just take it easier, and there's also ways to make this workout a bit more challenging. I LOVE that it's only 30 minutes long. Nikki puts upper and lower body moves together to which challenges your core AND cuts out unneccesary time making this the perfect quick workout! The video is easy to follow if you want to listen to your own music and turn the tv volume down. Thats big for me because most workout videos I've tried I can kinda struggle to keep up with the trainer, but not with Nikki! My only problem is I'm still a little unsure whether this can be used every day, or every other day, twice a week...? I just kind of use it as a supplement workout for days when I can't seem to get my day together. If you're interested, I would HIGHLY recommend this video!",1322006400,2,944,4.25

Fitness DVD Created For Military Spouses

NikkiFitness Helps Keep Wives in Shape While Husbands Deployed

(New York, NY)-- When Laura E.'s husband was sent to Iraq and
Afghanistan, she was left with a seemingly impossible to-do list. She
had to handle all the household chores, pay the bills, take care of
her young daughter, complete her graduate degree, and work a full-time
job--not to mention worry about her husband at the same time.
She felt lonely and exhausted, and didn't think she had time for
anything else, especially exercising. As her stress and to-do list increased,
and her fitness level dropped, she reached out to a long-time friend and
fitness instructor for a solution.

""Laura and I live far away from each other, so taping a workout was the only
way to act as her virtual personal trainer,"" explained Nicole Glor, creator of the
NikkiFitness Military Wife Workout (MWW). ""She asked for a video that would
combine all muscle groups and cardio in just half an hour, so I made this
DVD for her and all other military wives like her. It's perfect for anyone
whose husband or boyfriend spends a lot of time away from home.""

During the DVD creation, Nicole began a monthly fitness column for
[...] which led to hundreds of emails and phone
conversations with other military wives. They all struggle with the
issue of staying in shape while their family members are deployed.

The MWW combines cardio intervals with combination upper and lower body
moves to get every major muscle group toned within 30 minutes. A warm-up and
stretch is included, as well as modifications and challenge adaptations for any fitness level.
It is now available on Amazon.com.

Different than traditional fitness DVD, the MWW will not show a studio full
of women doing the same old routine. It's shot in scenic locations
around New York City, with quick edits to keep people entertained and visually stimulated.

Also, in the spirit of YouTube and iPod and thousands of products tailored
to individual tastes, one generic sountrack isn't forced on
participants. The DVD sends exercisers to [...] for their own playlist suggestions
in many different genres. Each workout can include new music.

For more information, a biography, video demo, press clips, columns, photos
and letters from other military wives and mothers, log on to [...]

8256275,5,B0014TC2U2,This video packs alot into a little bit of time.  Multi-tasking to the max!  I give this superwoman five stars!!  Bravo Zulu!!,1239580800,,126,4.636363636363637
8256276,3,B0014TC2U2,"I bought this Nikki Fitness DVD b/c I liked the idea of a total body, weight/cardio training session in 30 minutes. Some of the other reviews said the video quality wasn't good, there was no music, you couldn't hear Nikki counting, etc. but since she tells you at the beginning of the DVD that you're supposed to do the workout while listening to your own music, none of that should matter. What does matter is the lack of warm-up/stretching exercises at the beginning of the work-out and the sometimes confusing jumping from one routine to another and then back to the previous with no warning (some parts give you a caption about what you're going to do, but not all). I would recommend the DVD but I would also recommend doing some additional stretches/warming up for at least 10 minutes prior to starting the workout and I would recommend watching the whole DVD first before you try to do the exercises so you'll have a better idea of the moves/changes/sequencing. I would also recommend that you buy it on sale or used b/c the poor digital/sound effects mentioned earlier definitely make this video worth less than $19.99. Maybe $9.99 would be a better deal.",1224806400,2,1163,4.705882352941177
8256277,3,B0014TC2U2,"Nikki has some good exercises incorporated into this workout, and it's a good fat-burner/ cardio mix. The quality of the video and sound production was poor. Nikki is quite bouncy and happy doing her exercises and counting inaudibly. Also, there's no music. I would be willing to pay $5-10. for this if I had it to do again.",1223164800,,324,4.603448275862069
