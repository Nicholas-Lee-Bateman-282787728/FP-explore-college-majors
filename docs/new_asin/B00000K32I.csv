1244006,5,B00000K32I,"After discovering the talent of Eddie Izzard on his D2K HBO special, I made it my mission in life to learn more.  Glorious was my second trip to the brilliantly funny world of Izzard.  Not since Monthy Python have I  laughed so hard for so long. Eddie wraps his mind around the most mundane  and turns it into something fresh and wonderful. I only hope someone  produces a movie and incorporates Eddie's view on what a computer user is  like in the REAL world!  If you haven't discovered Eddie for yourself, I  highly recommend you join the growing contingent of Izzard fans and check  out Glorious.",936921600,14,599,4.5754716981132075

1244086,5,B00000K32I,"The first time I saw Eddie Izzard I wasn't sure what to think, I was living in England with my Husband (who is English and was born there and our son) we were watching one of Many Eddie Izzard shows. Glorious, I believe was the third DVD we watched that were Eddie Izzard DVDs.

I have never laughed so hard in a very long time.

It states that this DVD is Not Rated. however he can be VERY crass at some points so I wouldn't recommend it to a family with small children. In England it is rated 18 and you cannot purchase it unless you have ID proving you are 18 to purchase something marked with an age guide, or you could be fined.

If you buy this & like it I would recommend Dressed to kill next. He is every bit as funny in that one and there is really no single preference for me when it comes to Eddie Izzard., You have to understand British Humour a bit but now too much as he really does good on Any Subject.
I would recommend this DVD/Blu-Ray to my friends (and have done so)

If you like comedians It makes for a fun night. Either with your one & only significant other, or a group of friends. He is a laugh a minute ~ you are guaranteed to be the host/hostess of the neighborhood if you start having comedy nights with your friends and neighbors. It's definitely a 5 star night!",1393891200,,1290,4.107142857142857

1244113,5,B00000K32I,Izzard is probably not for everyone. You have to have not only a sense of humor with a few choice words here and there.

1244115,5,B00000K32I,"This is smart comedy, the kind that comes back around on itself later in the performance. The show is laid out in 3 parts: the 1st half is the Old Testament, the 2nd half is the New Testament and the encore is the Book of Revelation. It's quirky, and a mild appreciation of British humour will help to make it even funnier.  If you don't like British humour, he's still funny, but you might find some parts a little out there or just stupid.  I didn't.  This guy is hilarious.  He is a cross-dresser though, so if you have issues with that, you'll need to get past it to really enjoy the performance.",1326672000,,600,4.283185840707965

He does a delightful imitation of an evil giraffe, a hilarious Sean Connery impression, and remembers the utter uselessness of push-mowers. How about Eddie as a beekeeper - flirting? Or those appliance dials that lie to us. Love ya, Eddie. I agree with another reviewer that Izzard should be prescribed medication for anyone feeling a bit blue one day.

1244143,3,B00000K32I,"I got this for my husband for Christmas.  We have seen ""Dressed to Kill"" several times and have saved it on our TIVO because we love it so much.  After reading the reviews for Glorious, I thought this would be the perfect gift.  However, it was a little of a let down.  While there were absolutely some side splitting moments, I found that we weren't laughing for at least half the film.  Don't get me wrong, it was entertaining....but there is a difference between entertaining and laughing out loud.  We watched it late at night and I saw my husband nod off at one point.  After 30+ minutes of no laughing, he reigned you in with a gut buster.  Also, the encore was hyterical!!  There was quite a bit of british humor that fell a little flat on us and in the middle, I found myself watching the clock.  I gave it 3 stars because about a third of it was side-splitting and the rest was no funnier than an entertaining sitcom.  I would recommend watching it once, but not buying the DVD.  I also bought ""Definite Article"" and am hoping it will live up to my expectations from ""Dressed to Kill.""",1230854400,,1094,4.361386138613861

I decided to get it on DVD because he uses some visual humour to go with the verbal, and I did not regret getting this DVD. He is hilarious. That's all there is to it. He's the best stand-up comedian there is, and this is his best work. I can't say what his best routine is because they're all so awesome.

1244178,5,B00000K32I,"I laughed just as hard the 10th time I watched this as I did the first time. For a person more prone to amused snorts than outright laughter, that's saying something. It's not just that the lines are funny, it's his delivery. He is a master. Some find this to be not as good as his later stuff, but I'm not in that camp. 'Glorious' is different, and it's brilliantly funny.",1203465600,,373,4.267605633802817

1244183,5,B00000K32I,"My daughter played this dvd for me and many of the lines are now family jokes! It is very,very clever! Every day occurences are made into hysterical routines. Izzard works them into the Old Testament, some Greek mythology, career choices, British royalty, and the New Testament, to name just a few. By the time he gives a Revelations encore I could hardly breath. There is nothing offensive in this routine, there is occasional use of the ""f"" word, but not in a derogatory or explicit way. His physical comedy is as funny as the script. I haven't laughed so hard since ""Bill Cosby,Himself"". I'd recommend this for anyone over 12!",1187827200,,629,4.7272727272727275
1244184,5,B00000K32I,"While ""Dress to Kill"" is the definitive Eddie Izzard DVD (the ""Cake or Death?"" routine on that disc is probably the greatest single comedy bit of the last two decades), ""Glorious"" suffers only in comparison. Measured by any other standard, it's flat-out hilarious, period. The combination of Izzard's razor-sharp wit, offhand delivery, fluid stage movements and decidedly singular appearance makes for hilarious comedy that only those who have seen him in action can fully imagine. (Every Izzard performance contains throwaway bits that you'll cherish forever; in ""Glorious,"" my favorite is his impression of an evil giraffe.) Only Robin Williams matches Izzard's free-associative brilliance, and I prefer Izzard's style because, unlike Williams, he doesn't feel the need to call attention to it every second. Amazon offers a price break on ""Dress to Kill"" and ""Glorious"" ordered together; if you don't have both discs already, it's a deal I highly recommend. The world could do with more ""executive transvestites"" like Eddie Izzard!",1183420800,,1033,5.4625
1244185,5,B00000K32I,"I think Eddie Izzard it simply the best stand up comedian in the world.
His humor is very intelligent.  He looks at things from a different perspective and points out the obvious, that is not obvious if you don't think about it, which  makes it very funny.  The fraises from his shows became an essential part of my family's vocabulary.  ""Glorious"" and ""Dress to Kill"" are his two best shows. I think we saw each DVD at least 10 times.",1182988800,,435,4.4

1244225,4,B00000K32I,"I was first exposed to Eddie Izzard in the ""Dress to Kill"" show and I immediately fell in love.  His blend of the silly, the cerebral, and the stick that slaps is perfect for fans like me.  I went out and bought the DVD and have enjoyed it thoroughly for 3 years.

Recently, though, I've been looking for more of his work and after reading a bunch of reviews right here I decided to spring for ""Glorious.""  Before I say anything else let me just say that I am NOT disappointed.  I got several big belly laughs from this show and I think that just about anyone else would, too.

That said, I have to admit that I don't believe this is his best work.  I say this primarily for the fact that he seems less energetic in ""Glorious.""  If you know Mr. Izzard, then you know that he's never really 'slow', he's always got some enthusiasm in his shows but to me it just seemed like this one had less of it.  The topics covered in this show aren't quite as diverse as those covered in ""Dress"" either, and I feel that he overdoes the James Mason voice, but all in all these are not good enough reasons to skip ""Glorious"" altogether.  It's a good show and it's got plenty of everything that makes him great.

My suggestion would be for newer fans of Eddie Izzard to hold off on this one until they've seen ""Unrepeatable"" (which in my opinion is the closest to ""Dress"") and possibly ""The Definite Article"", both of which show a more energetic star.  Just remember that it's Eddie Izzard so you can't really go wrong.",1174608000,3,1503,4.309608540925267

However, I find that Glorious is just as funny to me, it's just that there's more hit and miss. D2K seems more like a polished routine, whereas Glorious seemed like there was more improv and less written material. It's more hit and miss, but when you laugh, you laugh hard.

1244231,5,B00000K32I,"Fans of Eddie Izzard will enjoy this 1997 performance before an appreciative audience at the Apollo in Hammersmith. Our favorite cross-dresser is in top form, opening with a parody movie trailer of Eddie as himself in an action thriller set in New York. The show is loosely structured around a comic and impious survey of dramatic moments from the Bible, including the Creation and the Flood, in which a pair of ducks decline to board Noah's ark. Noah himself has to be persuaded not to build a speedboat instead.

Physical humor abounds (including a galumphing giraffe), and there are the usual and much appreciated impersonations of James Mason and Sean Connery. The 90-minute concert concludes with a lengthy and hilarious sequence involving an uncooperative computer. The DVD includes both a commentary by Eddie and a ""trivia version"" of the show, with oddball factoids showing up in subtitles. You'll love it.",1164931200,2,914,5.093333333333334

Personally I think that if any of his acts could give dressed a run for its money it would be Glorious. Although, that may be because I watched dressed over 100 times and it kind of lost any moments that could take me by suprize and make me laugh. Anyways If you are an Izzard fan Glorious is a must see!",1162425600,,466,4.131868131868132

1244254,5,B00000K32I,"For all of those that think Glorious isn't as good as Dress to Kill...""Ein minuten bitte!""  This show is every bit as good.  I admit that the first time I watched it, I thought the beginning was a little slow as well.  But I watched it again and I paid more attention to it.  Sean Connery as Noah?  Sean Connery as Noah telling the animals with long ears to get in the ark and sit on the sides with their heads out because it will look ""f-ing excellent?""

The beginning is wonderfully funny, I think the reason why it seems slower then the rest of it is because he's not being quite as energetic at that point.  That's my opinion.

For those that think Dress to Kill was a little more polished than Glorious, watch Dress to Kill again, carefully.  You'll see that they are both a little frantic, crazy; improved.  They both go off on wonderful tangents and they are both brilliant.

He is at his best when he seems to not quite know what he is doing.  Some of the funnier things he has said are at those times when he looks to be a little lost and doesn't know where the joke is going.

In my opinion, this is just as good as Dress to Kill.  If you want to introduce someone to Eddie Izzard, show them either Glorious or Dress to Kill and they will be hooked.",1153612800,4,1259,4.170124481327801

Is he really a ""he""?).  From hearing about Genesis to wondering why Noah had to get two of everything... including ducks..., Eddie Izzard brought a unique perspective to comedy.  Nothing was off limits... the Queen Mother, Death, hopscotch, speed archeology, toasters, and Achilles.  It is all here!

Take special note of the set... very minimalist.  Izzard uses his talents to make you ""see"" what he is describing, without depending on props.  From swords to Hoovers, you will get his meaning.

1244295,5,B00000K32I,"I first saw Eddie Izzard while watching HBO one Saturday night. The concert was entitled ""Dressed to Kill"". I had never heard of Eddie before, and by the time it was over, I was wondering what rock I had been dwelling under to have never seen this brilliant comic.

""Glorious"", while not quite as even as ""Dressed"", still left me in tears. The show begins with a Eddie's take on the book of Genesis, then travels on towards the Trojan horse (""Bye! Well done! Here's a horse for you..per usual..Bye!""), takes a hard left into the British Monarchy, shower water temperature and baboons in mime, before ending up in the book of Revelations. And, as a previous reviewer noted, the encore is probably the funniest 8 minutes of comedy I have seen in a long while.

I ordered this DVD last year, actually, way before they had an expected release date and was thrilled to receive it yesterday. I have the video, but the extras on the DVD make it well worth the purchase.  Eddie's audio commentary on the show that he himself hasn't seen for seven years is priceless, ""now, um...what AM I doing there?  Oh yes... this is when I started saying Jam a heck of a lot"". The ""Lust For Glorious"" intro is also featured, poking fun at the big summer blockbuster movie previews, and featuring Eddie in some very funny and very sexy situations.  Another interesting feature is the english 'bleeped' audio track, which works very well when trying to share Eddie with one's Grandmother.  (I know this from personal experience). Finally, there is a written triva commentary you can choose that displays below the subtitles.  You can't say the man isn't giving his all! :)

Overall, I'd say Dress to Kill is the best and Glorious places a very close second in Eddie's stand-up comedy concert series.  Both are must haves.  You'll find yourself saying ""so...yeah"", ""I'm covered in bees"" and throwing the word ""jam"" into sentences when you can't find the right word, but those are small prices to pay for the sheer joy and laughter you'll get from Eddie's DVD.

Only Eddie can jump through topics both mundane and serious and keep you laughing the whole time. He goes through Greek mythology, politics, vacuuming, the British monarchy and religion, and somehow weaves them all together in his wonderfully silly and surreal way.

I think the fact that he's a transvestite hurts his mainstream appeal in our uptight nation, but screw the mainstream, BUY THIS VIDEO!!!

I listened to this show on CD for 3 months prior to getting it on VHS and to see it now after all this time is being great.  First off, it is not exactly the same as Glorius the CD.

1244330,4,B00000K32I,"One night I was flipping through the channels and I saw this bizarre make up wearing Englishmen waltzing across a stage on HBO. Being a fan of British humor, I stopped to have a listen, which is a rather strange occurance for me being as I despise stand-up comedy. I ended up watching the entire performance, laughing out loud in my house through the majority of the show. The show I caught however was Eddie Izzard's Dress to Kill, which is a more recent performance than Glorious. It was so funny that it made me go online and buy Glorious because I had to have more Eddie Izzard. In fact, Dress to Kill is the reason that Glorious only got 4 stars instead of 5. If Dress to Kill ever comes out for sale, get it...it is riotous.
  Nonetheles, Glorious is hilarious too. The thing bout Eddie Izzard is that he is not your typical stand-up comedian joking about sex, race, or in-laws. Glorious is Eddie's telling of the Bible story (not blasphemous for those of you concerned Christians, rather a well-informed yet humorous rendition, if you will). Of course he gets off the subject, and somehow ends up talking about giraffes and hovercraft vaccuum cleaners, which makes for a really entertaining show.
God:""Oh Jesus Christ!""
Jesus:""Dad, stop taking my name in vain.""
God:""...oh, Jeezy Chreezy""
Not exact, but one tidbit I can remember. Anyway, Eddie Izzard is a great entertainer amd is definitely worth your time. ONE THING WORTH MENTIONING HOWEVER. If you have a family with young children, or have a problem with cursing or swearing, then Eddie may not be the comedian for you. The subject matter of his shows is quite appropriate but, he being a crazy European, his language is right up there with an Osbourne's. Personally I find it humorous, but I know that there are some people who prefer not to hear the ""F word"" used as a noun, a verb, an adjective,...you get the idea.

He obviously grew on the audience, because at the end when he says goodnight, there is an audible, ""Ahhhhhhh."" of disappointment because they didn't want it to end. I feel the same way.

He starts off on one topic, gets distracted, goes off on a tangent, and finds his way back to the original idea over and over again, and it works. I really think Glorious is as good as DTK, although there was a lot of Brittish humor I didn't get, it didn't take away from it for me. It's another one of those things I can watch over and over again, and that technology bit at the end is going to make me laugh every time.",1034640000,2,610,4.049586776859504
1244353,5,B00000K32I,"I thought I would add to the adoration of the comedic genius that is Eddie Izzard and give the naysayers who gave this tape less than five stars a good telling off. I am one of many Izzard fans in the UK who think that his earlier work was as good as, if not better, than D2K. The problem is, many of the funniest jokes just don't translate to our transatlantic cousins. The reason D2K has gone down so well is that is was recorded in San Francisco, and so Izzard had altered the routine to cater to the local audience. I think this is one of the true marks of the man's genius. On the divine Definite Article (where we are introduced to Mrs Badcrumble and the real reason old ladies wear hair nets.... the hair thieves, they come in the night!) there is a feature afterwards about Eddie on tour. It shows how effectively, more so than any other stand up comedian I have ever seen, he manages to intergrate some local tidbits into his show, and alter some of the language so that the jokes are understood. I think the best comparison I can make is how I watced Absolutely Fabulous with a friend after spending a week showing him around Britain. He came away with a completely different understanding of some of the jokes, which would have gone over his head otherwise. This said, Glorious is exactly that. It features some of my favourite Izzard moments, without doubt. I never tire of regaling my friends with why toast is good, but toasters are evil (they have a turny-dial-knob thing, and it lies), and how Sean Connery as Noah wanted the animals with long ears to stand along the edges of the Ark-cum-Speedboat as their wind-blown ears would look much better in the picture in the Bible! I have yet to fail to convert anyone, Brit or American, who I have shown this tape to Izzardism... seeing is beliving!",1029542400,6,1810,4.454819277108434
1244354,4,B00000K32I,"I am a huge fan of stand up comedy, and Eddie Izzard holds his own.  One of the most intelligent comedians of all time.  He takes the simpliest ideas, adds mime, and make it hilarious.  I have never been so entertained through and through by any out there.  He does curse, but you don't have to flinch or think disgusting his subject matter.  Though this tape does have a few slow moments and jokes only the English demographic would get, Eddie Izzard is worth watching over and over.  Any bugs there are in Glorious have definetly been worked out in his next run, Dressed to Kill, done in New York.  This caters easier to Americans than before, which I think is a small reason why it is liked more, but anyone can enjoy it.

  Over all, Eddie Izzard is truely talented and on key in his act.  He is the type of guy who will stick in your memory wether you want him to or not.  He maintains his energy until the end of every show and always keeps you listening.  He jumps from subject to subject and has a knack for sticking odd ideas and out of placed words in normal situations and sentences.  Though I've watched his skits over and over, I still wonder if they are rehearsed or improved!!

1244356,5,B00000K32I,"There is a reason Eddie Izzard won an Emmy or two for his HBO special ""Dress to Kill"":  he's a bloody genius.  He's one of the absolute best physical comics I have ever seen.  His style jumps all over the place, throwing in wild references when you are least expecting them.  And his James Mason impression is right on!
""Glorious"" is an earlier effort preceding the gem referred to by reviewers as D2K.  Some reviewers are saying it's not as good as D2K.  I think this is an unfair evaluation.  This special was geared toward his audience back home, and it is ripe with references from his early shows.  American viewers might say, ""Who is Mrs. Badcrumble?"" for instance.  There is also a language barrier with American and UK audiences, something he brilliantly points out, if you'll remember, in D2K.  You might feel tempted to find a British person and ask them to open their verbal dictionary for you.  But I promise you, once you figure out what things mean, you will find so much more humor in his stories.
Some people also find it strange that he is a transvestite.  I will just say that in today's world, nothing should shock you anymore.  In the future, I hope that Eddie is known for his unique performance style and not for his skirts.  I wish Entertainment Tonight would not refer to him as, ""cross-dressing comedian Eddie Izzard.""  It should be ""sensational talent Eddie Izzard"" instead.
My suggestion to you is to check out some of Eddie's earlier works if you get the chance.  It's difficult to get videos of his early shows unless you live in England, but if you're serious about getting to know this fantastic comic, Amazon sells an import CD set of his shows ""Unrepeatable"" and ""Definite Article"" in their Popular Music section.  I've had a listen to these and they are wonderful.
In the meantime, enjoy this show featuring:  Sean Connery building the Arc, God creating toasters and jam, the queen who lives forever, Achilles and his hoovering heel, and the evil habits of giraffes, ducks, and pilot fish.  Fits of laughter are guaranteed!",1027123200,35,2057,4.695530726256983
1244357,3,B00000K32I,"Maybe this ought to be 4 stars, but I did feel just a wee bit let down. 'Glorious' doesn't have quite the polish of 'Dress to Kill,' either in the video's own production (sound and film quality, that is to say), or in Izzard's own performance. There's a degree to which i'd say he seems overly self-aware, and his sense of timing seems to have developed (along with his ability to let loose) just a wee bit more in the few years between this and DtK. In this video, he also lacks a bit of his usual talent for playing with bombed jokes, but again, that's a skill he later honed.
Don't take this to say it's no fun -- my letdown is mostly just due to comparison to more recent work, and no doubt there's a certain degree of familiarity at issue here. But on a hot summer day, when cable was letting me down and it was too hot to move, and all my videos i'd watched too much too recently, I put in this tape, newly-arrived, and yet couldn't quite sit still through it all. I stopped it a few times to do other things. But I always came back and watched it all.

A lot of the other reviewers say D2K is funnier but I have to disagree as they must not have seen Unrepeatable or Definate Article as they are far superior. However if you want to get into the world of Eddie Izzard then watch Glorious first as it is by far the best of all his shows. If your American and you want to play it safe then get D2K as it was filmed in San Francisco and directed more towards a U.S. audience. My advice don't play it safe as Eddie is Glorious.,1009065600,,548,4.130841121495327
1244372,5,B00000K32I,"The title of Eddie Izzard's video 'Glorious' is fantastically appropriate; in my opinion not as hilarious as 'Dress to Kill' but still Glorious reveals some incredible gems of Eddie Izzard's comic genius.
Being a Briton like Eddie you may think i'm biased; i'm sure the vast majority of the audience for this will be American. However, i sincerely hope that Eddie's influence over the humour of everyone in this country can spread across the pond too.
Based on the Old and New Testament, Glorious might not seem to have much promise if that's all you hear of this fantastic gig. However with Eddie behind the mic, you can guarantee every word that comes out of his mouth will have you rolling in your seat. And it does: this is something you will never regret buying, it's so watchable it'll surgically attach itself to your DVD player. Eddie is a God, may his Glory continue.",1008115200,2,876,4.694805194805195
1244373,5,B00000K32I,"If you've seen Eddie Izzard, you have to see Glorious.  It is one of the most intelligent, witty, and surprising comedic routines that I have ever seen.  Izzard brings new light to history, delving into the Bible, and Greek Mythology.  In one bit he re-portrays the scene of Noah talking to God.  Noah is played by Sean Connery (just because), who whimsically wants to make the ark a speedboat instead.  Noah thinks that the dogs ears flapping in the wind will make great pictures for the Bible.  Izzard also ellaborates on Achilles protecting his foot with concrete.
There is also the realism part to the routine that makes Izzard's social commentary very important to our time.  He includes a bit where he talks about getting beat-up for cross-dressing and its complications.  He has a very realistic yet playful outlook on life that is both charming and inspiring (not to mention quite humorous).  I really want this DVD to be released in the states, please don't be afraid to pre-order (because that helps to determine it). I swear to you that if you're a fan of Izzard, Glorious cannot be missed.",1007424000,,1101,4.752631578947368

After a while I was laughing so hard it hurt, and forgetting all about the make-up. And then I was thinking about how I could bring him into my college classroom to get my students thinking. Then I was finding him very attractive. Since that first time, we show every stranger who walks into the house one of Eddie's tapes. His views on life and politics and history and the bible and sex and squirrels, well on everything is just so unusual and brilliant and so so so funny. God bless you Eddie.

He has quite a range, from serious, bearded actor to one of the world's top comedians (a bizarre combination of Monty Python and Robin Williams, in a dress and makeup...still looking rather butch). He's been hailed in Britain as ""The Unknown Python,"" (and showed up on stage for the first 5 mins of the Colorado Tribute to the Pythons on the HBO special, posing as one until they threw him off...scripted, of course).  And, like Dennis Miller, he cross references everything...only he uses more history than pop culture.  If they ever release the bloody DVD, I highly reccomend this one...the only one better than this is the one that came after, Dress To Kill. The only fault with Eddie Izzard is that he seems to think that the US consists of NYC & LA...no cities in between get visited when he comes over here. Bad Eddie.

1244378,5,B00000K32I,"Izzard proves that he is the greatest living comedian in this video. While I had first caught glimpses of his act during ""Dress Kills"" run on HBO, it was this video that proved to me the real genius that is Eddie Izzard.
This T.V. Brit takes on every aspect of the human condition and inevitablely leaves you crying for more. His style is such a refreshing contrast from his contemporaries. His use of explicit language, while there, is used not to shock or offend, but as if you were thinking the same thing to yourself and goes by unnoticed (some moralists will have a field day with that concept).
In addition, Izzard's use of story and gesture to communicate his perspective on the world makes him better rounded than his New York megastar peer and master of observation comedy, Jerry Seinfeld. Also, Izzard's comedy is not bent on getting to the punch line and making you laugh. Instead, this is a show that is meant to last 90 minutes and makes you want more.
I bought this video nearly two years ago and it still gets play in my VCR. This is not one I leave out for show to prove my friends how cool I am; rather, I put it in the VCR to show how cool I am. This is by far one of the best purchases I have made and would gladly buy it for myself again or for a friend.
Izzard's humor is irreverent, but classy, intellectual, but slapstick, and hilarious, but hilarious... there is simply no other way to put it. You need him in your home. You really have no idea how much. You'll thank me when you buy it.",994723200,13,1511,4.286713286713287

The humor in this video is witty, Izzard is kind of the thinking persons comedian. Instead of talking about farting (don't get me wrong. I find it hilarous as well) he talks about the old testament and vaccum cleaners and evil herbivores. His girraffe impression is not to be missed.

It's a mystery whether or not the show is spontaneously performed (ad-libbed) or if it's actually prepared, because it skips and jumps and rambles and moves around quickly and funnily.  I recommend it to everybody.  Though many people fear watching a British transvestite, you forget that he's a transvestite by the first five minutes into the act, because it's hilarious.  Though some people may think it long and ever-going and somewhat boring, it is for those who liked other Eddie Izzard acts, Monty Python, and something completely different, and really brilliant.

His topics include the Royal family, playground activities, toasters, showers, computers, small planes and toasters. Only he can jump between completely different topics in such a seamless way.

1244432,5,B00000K32I,"What makes Eddie Izzard work for me is the way in which he's able to be  both grand and self-deprecating simultaneously.  From the opening chords  of music, carefully choreographed against a light show more common to rock  stars than comics, GLORIOUS puts you on notice that this ain't just a guy  with a mike.  And indeed the reaction of the crowd to Izzard's spotlit  entrance makes you believe that you are witness to royalty.
Until he  speaks.  And then you realize that he's just a guy.  In drag.  Who hasn't  really rehearsed all that much.
Thank God.
Rehearsal would only cloud  things with certainty.
Izzard attempts majesty-GLORIOUS is essentially  a tour of the Bible's greatest hits-but doesn't mind if he forgets how to  get there.  He frequently looks spoilt for choice, slowly deciding where he  should go next. And this is perhaps where he's at his most charming.  Sometimes he seems liable to fall off the trapeze he's built for himself.  But his gaffes are incorporated into his act to the point that you find  yourself actively HOPING he'll screw up, just so you can witness his  escape.
And that's his secret.  By screwing up and laughing about it,  he proves himself uniquely able to get an audience on his side.  Far from  being simply a hilarious way to spend a couple of hours, GLORIOUS should be  required in freshman communication classes at college.  It's masterful  public speaking masquerading as comedy.
[VHS Notes:  The recording here  is of fine quality.  The audio technicians were dead on target.  Oddly,  though, the choice of venue might have resulted in a performance that isn't  as universally understandable as the show was in its original form.  For  reasons obscure, what had been a mostly off-Broadway, American show was  recorded for posterity before a British audience.  He's clearly energized  playing to a home crowd, but if you were hoping this would capture the  great live show you saw in New York, prepare to be slightly disappointed.  Non-Britons definitely  lose something in the translation. Also, parents  should be cautioned that the language is probably unsuitable for younger  viewers, though it doesn't sink to the level of gratuitous vulgarity in my  estimation.  Some parents may object to liberties taken with the Bible,  but I think his act just proves the point of how central the Bible is to  western civilization.]",968371200,15,2378,4.931297709923665

""Glorious"", while not quite as even as  ""Dressed"", still left me in tears.  The show begins with a  Eddie's take on the book of Genesis, then travels on towards the Trojan  horse (""Bye! Well done!  Here's a horse for you..per  usual..Bye!""), takes a hard left into the British Monarchy, shower  water temperature and baboons in mime, before ending up in the book of  Revelations.  And, as a previous reviewer noted, the encore is probably the  funniest 8 minutes of comedy I have seen in a long while.

As most of the people here say, Glorious  is not as good--it might only have an hour's worth of good material. That's  an acceptable amount, easily, when you consider how funny he is when he's  on.

1244450,4,B00000K32I,"While ""Glorious"" is a great comedy concert video by most standards, it is below average by Izzard's own. ""Glorious"" fell in between his star-making (in the UK and some of Europe, anyway)  ""Definite Article"" and the US-taped ""Dress to Kill"",  and he might have been too busy adjusting to his newfound stardom to really  dedicate himself to a new show. In many ways ""Glorious"" plays  like a very long and pleasantly inspired bonus track to ""Definite  Article"", but Izzard is ""only"" good here. His true genius  shines on the 2 afore-mentioned videos, and earlier, more subdued, slightly  less focused stuff can be sought out on ""Live at The  Ambassador's"" and ""Unrepeatable"".
