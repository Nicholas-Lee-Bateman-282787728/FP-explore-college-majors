4332392,5,7885142612,"Chen Zhen (played by Donnie Yen) has returned to Shanghai, only to find it under dire threat by the Japanese. Chen takes the identity of a famous masked superhero, and launches a crusade to fight all Japanese incursions. However, the Japanese are very strong, and betrayal is everywhere. Can one man make a difference?

I must say that this is a really good movie. It has an intriguing plot and a lot of great action and fight sequences. Donnie Yen does an excellent job of portraying Chen Zhen  channeling Bruce Lee, while still making the character his very own.

If you like a good martial arts movie, the kind with realistic looking action (no flying), then check out Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen, you won't be disappointed!",1469664000,,743,4.656488549618321

Its like EVERY DVD copy of this movie is simply unwatchable. This is not simply some pretentious air about video crispness. Depending on the copy, five to 40 minutes into the movie the disk just starts to pause, skip and stop working. I've watched bootlegs that were better quality than this. At first I thought it was just the older DVD copies but the new blu-ray combo DVDs have the same problem. Have no idea if the blurays are as bad.",1462060800,2,578,4.411214953271028

Now, ive seen the Bruce Lee original Fist of Fury & the Jet Li remake Fist of Legend. I enjoyed them both & Return of the Fist is no different. I felt the beginning was a bit slow but after 10 mins did pick up for me & held my interest all the way through. The fight scenes as always is the case with Donnie Yen, were great to me.

4332436,1,7885142612,"There is nothing wrong with the acting. Donnie's acting was quite convincing as Chen Zhen, and so was Anthony Wong. The fighting scenes are quite good too. The story, however, is not really worth mentioning. I believe this is a sequel of the previous movie, by Jet Li, with a very similar title: Fist of Legend. Unlike the previous title, Legend of The Fist had a lot of holes in the plot. It's a waste of great talents. I'm not sure if the director even bothered to have any preview before releasing it to the public.

4332443,4,7885142612,"Having recently refreshed my knowledge of Southeast Asia and never seen a Donnie Yen feature, this was an exciting introduction to the martial artist in a in between-wars landscape of political intrigue. I found the art direction as compelling as the political characters of this action drama. Opening in World War I, Donnie Yen (as Chen Zhen) leaps and somersaults bullets to thrilling effect and then moves the action to mainland China where the story gets complicated by nationalist and imperialist maneuvering, pivoting upon the action at the night club ""Casablanca,"" reminiscent of Rick's caf from the same film title. Of course there is a love interest that begins to take shape in the nightclub songstress, Shu Qi (as Kiki) before she reveals her true loyalty. When the Japanese leaders exhibit brutal opposition, a lone, masked warrior (Yen)rallies the Chinese people. Too much like 'Kato' (Green Hornet), the undercover warrior/rebel(Yen)abandons his masquerade in time to force a mano a mano showdown with a Japanese rival (Kohata Ryu), where the fists fly. Shu Qi sparkles in a thankless part when you think of the many Hollywood dolls in similar roles (Marlene Dietrich, Veronica Lake) where Jimmy Stewart or Alan Ladd walked away with the kudos. In this 'Legend' she handles her undercover part with enough ambivalence as her part allows, displaying enough sweetness to soften her betrayed loyalty (or fans).
The director,(Andrew Lau) does a good job keeping his fiction from obscuring the historical 1920s China with the martial chops of Jeet Kune Do and song numbers a la ""Chicago,"" adding enough noir elements to include a hammy police inspector into the mix. The language and wardrobe were a tad contemporary (70s)in places but the murky politics fascinates enough to make it entertaining from beginning to smashing finish.",1394409600,,1840,5.198653198653199

In the film, we're shown overt references (or, perhaps, homages) to films of the ""modern"" era Lau apparently admires greatly. In "". . . Chen Zhen"", we see overt references to such films as ""Rambo"", ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Chicago,"" ""Batman,"" ""The Karate Kid, Parts I and II,"" and to Tarantino's own ""kill Bill, Vol. I"". The storyline is not a problem for the average viewer to follow, as its ventral issue, the battle in Northern China between Zeng's ""North"" Army and Zhau's ""Northeast"" Army, a civil conflict presumably preventing China from fighting against Japan as a solid front, is put before the viewer at the start of the film. Obviously, Lau is setting the viewed up for a 2nd installment of the ""Chen Zhen"" franchise (ala, the ""Batman"" series""), if you examine the inconclusive manner in which Gen Zhen's story ends with this film. Yet, due to apparent lack of international interest in this particular feature, it's unlikely a sequel will be ""in-the-works"" anytime soon. Hence, ""Legend of the Fist"" will be the viewer's only chance to witness the charm put on screen when Lau and Donnie Yen (""Chen Zhen"") work with this legendary Chinese folk hero.",1378252800,,1443,4.869918699186992

THE RETURN OF CHEN ZHEN

I will come out and admit it right now; I am a Donnie Yen fan and big one at that. Yen has more than proven himself as a martial artist in films and what more can you ask for? Well you can ask for more than that I do realize so don't get me wrong. Yen has been known in the acting world for over acting a bit but that is more than fine in the type of films he is in. now true martial arts fans know the character Yen is playing well thanks in part to the real life story and the character being portrayed by both Bruce Lee [Fist of Fury] and Jet Li [Fist of Legend].

Chen Zhen [Yen] is back in Shanghai after supposedly being killed in World War 1 under the guise of a friend who was killed, Qi Tianyuan. He is a charismatic man who quickly becomes a partner at the club ""Casablanca"" after impressing the owner. Little does anyone know he is working with an underground freedom group to stop the Japanese. He becomes romantically involved with the club's singer Kiki all while becoming a masked hero in the likeness of Bruce lee's ""Kato"".

Donnie Yen as usual is great in the action scenes showcasing all the moves that made him what he is today. When it comes to the action the film is really good and moves the film along nicely. But when the dramatic scenes come around sometimes it is hit or miss. Not too often but at times director Andrew Lau lets things slow down. It really could have benefited from a quicker pace but or at least letting the story and characters develop more.

Yen is good here though even with some over acting at times but he is a charismatic guy at that helps his screen presence. Anthony Wong is good here as the club owner and brings a little something extra to the movie. Shu Qui is good here as well as Kiki and may have the best character to play in the film, plus she looks good. Now there are liberties that are taken with the actual history and people here as I am sure you can tell but it makes for a fun flick.

Now even with everything I have said I will admit right now that I really did enjoy this movie. I love the time period of the film and the dark look of the film was well executed. Of course the fight scenes are great and when a certain police officer finally has enough it may just be one of the best scenes in the flick. I do recommend this movie to any one reading this because you may like it more than I did plus there are some very cool moments here. Also the music is excellent here.",1355270400,,2485,4.094455852156058

4332490,2,7885142612,"In ""Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen,"" Donnie Yen plays Chen Zhen, a fictional character that first appeared n a 1972 Hong Kong movie ""Fist of Fury"" (aka ""The Big Boss""). In the film Bruce Lee played the role of the hero, which has been taken up in many films and TV shows since then, including ""Fist of Legend"" starring Jet Li and, of course, a 1995 TV series starring Donnie Yen as Chen Zhen. Donnie Yen's new feature film directed by Andrew Lau is not a remake of the Bruce Lee film, but a sequel paying homage to the martial arts legend.

The story is largely set in 1925 Shanghai. Chen Zhen, who has returned from WWI, is now a member of the resistance group to stop Japanese army from invading China. Hiding his true identity, Zhen visits a club (named ""Casablanca"") owned by Liu Yutian (Anthony Wong), where Japanese and Western military officers including a Japanese colonel Rikiishi (Ryu Kohata) frequent. There Chen meets a beautiful singer Kiki (Shu Qi), who also has a secret or two to hide from him.

There are so many characters (including a cameo from Yasuaki Kurata, a familiar face of the 70s martial arts action films made in Hong Kong and Japan) and so many ideas and references thrown in. Some of the characters are unnecessary (do we really need Western characters here?). Some references are amusing (Green Hornet sidekick ""Kato,"" for instance); others are pretty obscure (one character's name is Yamaguchi, possibly referring to a real-life actress Shirley Yamaguchi). But wait, isn't this supposed to be an action movie?

Action scenes (choreographed by Donnie Yen himself) are certainly unique and powerful. The best part is the first scene in which Yen's Chen Zhen fights back the German soldiers in the WWI battlefield like a deadly version of Spider-man. Action sequences are mostly well-done except the very disappointing fight with Ryu Kohata in the climax. All the fast editing and camerawork cannot mask the fact that Kohata is not ready for the role as the opponent to Donnie Yen's hero. I read Kohata was an amateur boxer, but obviously he needs more skills as a fighter and an actor. You need someone like Sonny Chiba, someone with martial arts skills and charisma here.

Not a bad action movie, but far inferior to ""Ip Man.""",1318723200,5,2271,4.741772151898735

4332492,2,7885142612,"First off I would like to say that I am a big fan of Donnie Yen.  I think he is a great martial artist/actor; but what is up with his movies?  I love the first two Ip Man's, then I saw the preview to this one (The Legend of the Fist), it looked good so I bought it.  The begining was great, but it soon died down, it got boring and the pliot was confusing.  There was too much talking and not enough action.

  Another thing is that why do all the martial artist actors keep doing Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury.  Jet Li did his version of it and now Donnie Yen.  I'd say if you wanted to pay tribute to Lee, why not redo/finish the Game of Death.  It was never finished because Lee passed away, I think if someone did that movie, that'll be a nice tribute to Lee instead doing his Fist of Fury, enough is enough, we've seen it already come up with something else.  If you're a fan of Yen as I am then you'd probably keep this in your collection.  If you're just starting out with Yen I'd watch Ip Man first before buying this movie, it wasn't that good.  I'm afraid to get any other Donnie Yen movies because I fear that they won't be good.  I've seen Killzone and Flashpoint and those 2 movies weren't good neither.

The story line is barely cohesive and never really managed to captivate. It took me a while to figure out that one character was actually the chief of the Chinese police. That not withstanding, the only thing that kept me holding out for more was the hope of an awesome fight scene. There just never was anything memorable in that department! And like another reviewer (or more) commented...  I just can't believe the degree to which they resorted using all the Bruce Lee mimickery! I was embarassed and I was watching the movie alone!

I really doubt that I will watch this again! My advice? Rent it... but be prepared to be disappointed. The hype of the trailers is the best you will see... in the whole movie.

If watching the marvelous ""IP Man 2,"" previously reviewed here, re-ignited my interest for martial arts movies, the extraordinaire ""Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen,"" reaffirms it. And its star, Donnie Yen, has the charisma that we have been lacking and looking for since Bruce Lee.

The film begins in 1917, when 150,000 Chinese men were sent to fight along and assist the allies in World War I - a little known fact in history. They went without military training, and each one had a cooper wristband placed on them. We meet some of them in France, during that year, in fierce battles against the Germans, being led by Chen Zhen (Donnie Yen), whose talent in martial arts helped them survive the war and return home. As you can imagine, their contribution was ignored by the allies. We then fast-forward to Shanghai in 1925, and meet Chen Zhen again, this time working as a pianist at the prestigious Casablanca night club, owned by the powerful Liu Yutian (Anthony Wong Chau-Sang). Because Chen Zhen is very talented, Yutian quickly promotes him to manager of the club.

Unfortunately for all involved, Shanghai at that time was occupied by the English, with a Japanese invasion very imminent. All these soldiers and their officers frequented the Casablanca, and often humiliated the Chinese, causing a lot of resentment. The Japanese leader in town was Colonel Takeshi Chikaraishi (Ryu Kohata), a cold-blooded strategist and karate master, who creates a death list which threatens the lives of the most prominent anti-Japanese Chinese citizens in Shanghai. Chikaraishi quickly puts the list into effect, and many people are killed by his men. Enter Chen Zhen, who is also an organizer in the Chinese resistance underground, and in addition to that, he is the masked warrior, a Kato-lookalike hero, who fights the Japanese assassins. In the end, as you might expect, there is the inevitable confrontation between the Japanese invaders and the Chinese freedom fighters, in which Chen Zhen will play an important role.

""Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen"" is much more complex than this attempted description, but it all boils down to a Japanese (via Colonel Chikaraishi) versus Chinese (via Chen Zhen) confrontation. There is a lot of history here - mostly unknown by most of us --, as well as great action and fighting scenes. The production design of Shanghai in the twenties is just awesome, as well as the photography - Hollywood, take note. This is classy, first-rate entertainment. The exciting 2-disc Blu-ray edition features many extras, including behind the scenes documentaries, cast and crew interviews, and much more.

This was the ""sequel"" to Jet Li's incredible Fist of Legend (the remake of Bruce Lee's Fist of Fury), and sadly this time not even the great Donnie Yen can save this movie.

Set sometime after Chen Zhen's exile from Shanghi in the 1920's, Chen Zhen returns under an assumed identity to start a new life as a freedom fighter in the hopes of expelling the Japanese out of China.  Bogged down with a terribly slow plot, uninteresting characters and a stunning lack of fight scenes, this film loses steam after the first 30 minutes.  If you've seen the trailer, you've seen the best parts of the movie and scenes that weren't even in the film... which might of actually made it better.

4332510,4,7885142612,"We won't go into the bit where superheroes hadn't really come around yet in 1925... (But Zorro had, so maybe it's probably cool.)

Since everyone else was effing around, Donnie Yen took it upon himself to go make a quasi-sequel to Bruce Lee's FIST OF FURY (a.k.a. THE CHINESE CONNECTION). LEGEND OF THE FIST: THE RETURN OF CHEN ZHEN retains the unabashed nationalism of the Bruce Lee film but then injects a bit of a pulp hero sensibility. Given that there isn't as much martial arts as one could've wished for, Donnie Yen gets an opportunity to exhibit his acting chops. I thought he did decent. But, having already seen the IP MAN pictures, I already knew Yen could handle dialogue and demonstrate some nuance.

The story opens with a rather spectacular action set piece and a bit of historical trivia. I, for one, had no idea that the Chinese were used as laborers in Europe during WWI. In France, 1917, when Chen Zhen and his fellow Chinese are trapped by enemy fire, Chen Zhen springs into action, taking the fight to the Germans in one of those unbelievable, bloody violent, stunt-laden sequences. Chen Zhen's brutal knife work here would make Jack the Ripper weep with envy. Viewing this entire sequence will get your juices going, makes you anticipate further moments of badassery. But I'll spill the goods again. Too much talky talky, not enough Donnie Yen smiting goons with no remorse.

The plot picks up some years later, in 1925, as Chen Zhen makes his return to a Japanese-occupied Shanghai. Having adopted the name ""Qi Tianyuan"" and now sporting a pencil-thin mustache, Chen Zhen worms his way into a junior partnership at the swank nightclub, Casablanca, and it's all part of a plan. The nightclub's owner is in cahoots with the Japanese, and Chen Zhen figures this is the best way to stay on top of things. It's a highly charged political climate, as the Japanese delights in sowing dissension among the Chinese factions. When a death list is released, the fit really hits the shan.

I'll never turn down a chance to ogle Shu Qi. Plenty of spies in the house of Casablanca, Chen Zhen being merely one of them. We're filled in early on that Shu Qi's gorgeous nightclub hostess, Kiki, is a Japanese operative whose true name is, like, ""Kristy Yamaguchi"" or close enough to it. Her romance with Chen Zhen goes nowhere, so it may be best to just appreciate that quirky energy Shu Qi brings to the picture.

Props to the cinematography which is sleek and expertly rendered. But the visuals don't do anything to mitigate that jarring feel. The film strives to be different genres simultaneously. It aims for political drama, and a superhero tale, and a martial arts rabble rouser, but I don't think these elements coalesce into a perfectly unifying narrative. It did make sense that Chen Zhen, when he swoops in to kick arse, opts to don the costume and mask to avoid identification. But then the writers forget to develop the superhero angle, and then, for the third act, more or less wash their hands off it. Still, things perk up whenever Kato - er, I mean the Masked Warrior - pops up onscreen.

The Masked Warrior gets some good licks in, but it's the opening and closing action sequences that'll really float your boat. Ultimately, the story circles around to Bruce Lee, and this ties into the Japanese big bad's ulterior motive. The climactic showdown takes place in a dojo with Chen Zhen chopping down hordes of karate henchmen, or, as I like to call these guys: bruises on legs. There's a callback to Bruce Lee's ""sick men of Asia"" remark, and Donnie Yen even lets out with the occasional Bruce Lee dragon yelp. Mind you, I'm not saying that Yen captures the essence of Lee. I don't think he was going for that, and he doesn't achieve it, anyway. What Yen does is more of an homage and, from that viewpoint, it's a treat to watch him.

3.5 stars out of 5 for LEGEND OF THE FIST: THE RETURN OF CHEN ZHEN. I did mention all the talking, right? It's a heck of a chore, having to slog thru those big, dry chunks of exposition.

4332511,2,7885142612,"It starts off good, then here comes the nunchuks, then the ""Green Hornet, Kato"" (seen on the cover), then ""Enter The Dragon"" (Bruce Lee). This movie is mixed up. I believe the director was trying to combine a few different Bruce Lee movies in one. It did not do it for me and my friends. I'm glad I only spent $10.00 for the DVD.",1303430400,2,329,4.15625
4332512,2,7885142612,"Another martial arts actor attempts to imitate Bruce Lee on one of his films (Fist of Fury, realeased in USA as Chinese Connection), but again fall short.  It's amazing to me that the movie Bruce Lee made back in the 70s is still better than the modern made imitation of his film.  I would say the best imitation of Bruce Lee's movie was made by Jet Li in ""Fist of Legend"", but even that fall short compared to the original Bruce Lee film.

Bruce Lee will always be imitated but never duplicated.  He was the first martial artist with an open mind that combined all effective techniques from different martial arts from all around the world, not only the Chinese style, but Korean, Japanese, and even American (boxing).  He trained with the best to become the best fighter that became a legend.

Far as reviewing this film, they seem really hard to imitate Bruce Lee in every way possible with ""Kato"" mask look and even Bruce Lee's famous fighting sounds.  It just doesn't seem natural or original.  At least Jet Li portrayed/expressed his character in his own way so it looked more genuine than Donny in this film.  I'm surprised by the high rating of this film, but I guess if you never saw the original or Jet Li's version, this version is not bad.",1303344000,,1251,4.524444444444445

4332514,5,7885142612,"I was introduced to Donnie Yen from IP MAN like most people This is a great movie, based on the same story as Bruce Lee's FIST OF FURY and Jet Li's LEGEND OF THE FIST. This DVD is great with excellent picture and sound. Its a dual layer DVD with special features and a higher than normal bitrate (better picture than standard DVDs but will play in any player). The packaging is MINIMAL. It comes in just a glossy cardboard slipcase, that is shrinkwrapped. The DVD is in its own plastic envelope for protection. If you're still collecting and displaying your DVD collection, you won't want this DVD. If you just want to see the movie, this is for you. Personally, DVDs just get in the way, and I put them in case logic binders anyway, so this is perfect for me.",1296691200,,760,4.359154929577465
4332515,5,7885142612,"Another great one of Donnie Yen's movies. At times, the translation perhaps is not 100% accurate but then again 99% is. Lot of action, great sound specially if you own a home theater. I would personally recommend it.",1293926400,,216,4.7105263157894735
4332516,2,7885142612,"The movie is great. Fantastic actually. If you liked Ip Man, you'll like this. If you like Bruce Lee's FIST of FURY or Jet Li's FIST OF LEGEND, you'll also like this. But this particular DVD leaves a lot to be desired. Its barely watchable.",1292025600,,240,4.355555555555555
