8214787,3,B000HEWERG,"This looked like an interesting title, and I was surprised to see Toho's name attached to it. The disc is good; the picture looks good, and there's lots of extras. Discotek did a pretty good job with this, but then my standards may not be as high as some others. The disc has only one audio option, which is Dolby digital 2.0; whether or not this is a weak point is open to debate. The extra features amount to a little over an hour of material, depending on how fast you go through them. I personally haven't went through it all yet, but there's a decent wealth of it available. This is definitely worth the money, in my opinion.

As for the movie, it's not so good. The mechanical super-soldier story was interesting enough, but they didn't build on it very much. As a matter of fact, it didn't feel like they built on much of anything throughout the story. None of the main characters had very good development; they were just there. The most interesting part of the story is the other two unfinished super-soldiers chasing after the Mikadroid trying to end the experiment once and for all. Possibly one thing that hurt it is its relatively short run time, which is about seventy-three minutes. Not a lot of time to develop a good story.

Still, I believe most monster movie fans would find some interest in it somewhere, as I did. The release is quality, the movie is mediocre, and the combination of both should be a relatively enjoyable experience. I hope this review helps everybody!",1325980800,9,1490,4.5559701492537314
