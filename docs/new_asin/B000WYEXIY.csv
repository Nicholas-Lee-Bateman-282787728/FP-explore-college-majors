The menu doesn't work and you have have to go through each section to reach the section you want. As to its contents, it is more of a demonstration and actual instructional. What you get in this dvd is multiple demonstrations of the xing yi sword by various performers. There is no narration about the fine points of movement, nor is there any slow motion. For anyone with no prior background it would be a complete waste. For anyone with background and hoping to learn more, it would not provide any pointers that will improve one's learning. Although marketed as an instructional dvd is is merely a demonstration. Honestly, you will be much better off buying a dvd or vcd from china on the same topic with english subtitles. They are more detailed in presenting each action, they will break it down and point out the subtleties. Plus you more than likely pay much less (10$ and more). All in all, it is quite a disappointment and you will do much better with other dvds from china that are out there. Quite a waste of the talent of the performers.",1231200000,2,1181,4.497674418604651
8500524,3,B000WYEXIY,"I started out practicing the saber/broadsword and looked to the staff and spear to further my training.  Being new to the staff and spear I looked to this DVD with the mindset of learning a form.  Learning the staff would ultimately lead to learning the spear.

This DVD has great value in teaching the advanced applications of the staff and spear movements/techniques however the lack of scene selections can make finding one of the twelve applications bothersome.  There are no instructions on foot, arm or body placement so best for visual learners.  The movements are shown often enough at different angles to be able to perform them and the application part is great.  At times the movements can become confusing.

Although ""taught"" by masters, this DVD and the second version, Chinese Weapons 12 Animals Xingyi Staff & Spear, is not recommended for beginners but intermediate practitioners may not find too much new skills/techniques in either of these two DVDs.",1210032000,3,968,5.050314465408805
