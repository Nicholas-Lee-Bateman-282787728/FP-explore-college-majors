5709275,2,B00CA6RJN8,No narration just a video slide show.  I expected more of a narrative instead it is just a series of scenes.,1387929600,2,108,4.142857142857143
8579117,5,B00CA6RJN8,This Ocean Dreams Blu-ray has natural sounds with the music. Some of the music is downbeat and some more upbeat. I enjoy the slower pacing which gives me a chance to enjoy some really nice scenes. Very enjoyable!,1446681600,,212,4.605263157894737

8579119,1,B00CA6RJN8,Boring shorelines only.  Moved along quite slowly.  Would not recommend.,1427932800,,72,6.1

8579121,2,B00CA6RJN8,It's just not very good!  I expected something like a travelogue and this is simply sea scapes. not very interesting.,1401062400,,117,4.85
8579122,1,B00CA6RJN8,"I have been holding on to this one for a while. I popped the cellophane on it tonight. Awful. They set up the camera; shot 90 seconds of video; packed up and went to the next location. They did this 62 times. High on a mountainside overlooking the beach. Rocks in the foreground. Waves 2 miles away. Not one camera movement ever. No pans, tilts or zooms. Watch the palm fronds sway in the breeze to ONE looped song for 1 hour 33 minutes. And apparently it is illegal to film baby sea turtles scooting toward the ocean for more than 10 seconds. I was not aware of that until tonight! It was the only wild life in the film other than a pigeon hunting for food in the grass AND a black swan preening himself (or herself) in a picturesque pond with a tiny waterfall in the background. I think it was on the grounds of a tropical beach hotel, but I could be mistaken. I think I spotted a golf course one time. Palm trees were waving their branches in the ocean breeze.

There were beautiful vistas by the sandy shorelines but it became visually boring after 5 seconds. The color saturation was great. The colors were true. the 3D effects were dramatic. Some were overly cranked to exaggerate the effect. Note: the ocean at two miles away is not 3D. Nor are distant clouds during a sunset.

Seriously, do not waste your time. I booted my computer and wrote this review immediately after viewing it. It was THAT bad. I have GOT to view another 3D movie now just to get the bad taste out of my mouth.

BTW, I did not read the reviews prior to my purchase or I would NOT have purchased. Good luck and good ""3D"" viewing!",1398124800,6,1610,4.2894736842105265
8579123,3,B00CA6RJN8,"While the ocean scenery is indeed scenic, don't let the cover fool you. The coastal scenery is not from the Bahamas or the Caribbean, it looks more like coastal Baja, with Sierra desert, cactus, and rocky beaches.  I was a bit let down, but the price was good, so I am holding on to it.  Guess it depends on your coastal preferences.",1391299200,3,333,4.354838709677419
8579124,3,B00CA6RJN8,"It was definitely relaxing in the ""put you to sleep"" sort of way.  Some of the 3D images were beautiful, some were boring.  It is a series of live pictures set to music.  But the time between pictures was way to long which just made it boring.  I can only stare at a palm tree for so long.  Would not recommend this.",1390176000,,316,4.032258064516129
8579125,3,B00CA6RJN8,"I ordered this along with a new 3D TV and 3D home theater system.  The pictures are stunning, but it's more of a slideshow of scenery that lasts a few minutes each rather than a ""movie"".  It got a little boring, but the pictures are still gorgeous and the 3D almost makes you feel like you're there.",1388102400,2,299,4.228070175438597
8579126,1,B00CA6RJN8,"Just pictures that are way too long and boring, not very good 3D and I've seen quite a few. Music plays over and over and over.",1388102400,,127,3.923076923076923
