4525426,4,B0051O0NEI,"This movie is a cult classic - and... anyone from England will be very familiar with it already - but... in the US it is not as well known.  This movie follows a young punk singer who makes it big in the music industry and then follows the problems she has.
The sound track is excellent and well worth purchasing.  The movie is powerful and quite well done - the acting is excellent - including the leading role for newcomer Hazel O'Connor.
This film catapulted Hazel into stardom - which was mismanaged by her label at the time. (real life follows fiction).
A must buy for any late 70's punk afficianado.  Would make a great accompianment to ""Out of the Blue.""",985651200,6,661,4.446280991735537

4525435,3,B0051O0NEI,"Saw this movie first time as seventeen years old and it made a great impact on me. Went to London the same year and saw Hazel O'Connor live and the impact got even greater when the movie more or less was revealed in reality, with nazi skins jumping and shouting in the audience. Almost too real.
However the thirty and more years that have past doesn't make this movie any younger, of course.
The dialog is poor and the singing ain't that great either. Black Man is the only song that sticks in your mind.
That and O'Connors energy.

The packaging was great and comes with a booklet and some groovy postcards.
Avoid the U.S version of this movie. It is cut. The end is missing, as well as the song at the end of the movie. The Danny jukebox scene is also cut for some bizarre reason.

4525447,2,B0051O0NEI,I have waited a long time for this movie. If you are a fan I would wait some more. Do not buy the US edited version. I eagerly awaited the climax of the film only to find it ends abruptly after the song 8th Day. The last scene of Kate after her breakdown is completely missing.

4525448,4,B0051O0NEI,I was lucky enough to buy the U.K. issue when it came out on dvd a few years ago. Why any company would waste their time putting an edited HBO version to blu-ray when the full version is available to issue is pointless.,1320710400,4,219,4.116279069767442
4525449,4,B0051O0NEI,"I waited for YEARS for this movie to get rereleased. I must have seen it on New Wave Theater, and then rented the VHS at some point. I also have the soundtrack cassette, tho honestly its literally been at least 25 years since I've seen the film. So, I was dying to watch this film again, and bought it when i saw it released on DVD. If you read the other reviews, you notice that people are pretty upset that the original UK ending was removed from the film. Well, i never saw the British version of this film, so the way it ends is perfectly satisfying to me. I did notice that the sharp edit apparently didn't sit well with the director. When the end of the film FREEZES as Kate finishes singing her robot number, the screen goes black for the credits. In the backround, the film's SOUNDTRACK keeps going on, so you get to hear Kate's nervous breakdown in the subway, with all the voices from her past coming back. Then, right when her old boyfriend is visiting her in the mental hospital, bringing her the old little synth she played onstage as a sovenier, the credits end, and so does the sound of the film in the middle of a scene. Pretty bizarre...I've never experienced THAT before. All in all, tho, this is a very fun film in some ways. In other ways, its a very serious film, cos it deals with the economic depression in 1980s Britian, the Neo-nazi skinhead movement, the takeover of the Punk/new wave scene by big business music, the gas crisis, disaffected youth, random street violence, and drug addiction, none of which is fun at all.

Its an interesting contrast between cultures, to compare this film, which IS so typically british in many ways, with its american counterpart ROCK AND ROLL HIGH SCHOOL, which IS all fun and anarchy. There are other reasons why this film holds interest for the modern world. It predicts the rise of our Silicone computer lifestyle, which is a constant theme in the film. (By the end of the film, Kate is depersonalized, computerized, and robotic-- the very thing which she dreaded at the beginning of the film.) Also, being PUSHED into being drugged up to perform, has an errie parallel with the trial of Michael Jackson's doctor. If you believe what the film says, that doctor was doing exactly what the record companies wanted him to do, ie, keep the star on stage singing, no matter HOW Sick they are. AND, the producer of the film is Dodi Fahd, who was dating Princess Diana, and died in the car crash with her. The director also made that film WHATS LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT, which is also a film biography of a famous female rock star, namely Tina Turner. So there are reasons why, even tho Hazel O'Connor wasn't a star in the USA, and even tho the film is a history lesson of a rock scene heard second hand in the USA, and even tho the Neo Nazi theme is foreign more or less to the USA, that the film is relevant. Because the truth is that BIG BUSINESS still totally controls the music scene. Because bands always seem to take this arc, ending with the ""you-used-to-be-about-the-music"" finale. AND, because good music, and a good plot, will always make a film (a musical) like this interesting and fun. Granted, BREAKING GLASS a bit of nostalgia for the old folks. But its still got a message, because this film DOES have a heart to it, and no doubt human hearts still beat the same way now, as they did then. As for all you people who wish the ending had included Kate's mental breakdown, and her reconnection with her old boyfriend and her ""roots"", the fact is, if you look in Kate's face in that last frame, you can see that all spelled out. You just KNOW the road had ended for her, and the only way forward would be to move backwards. IF you remember the film as entertaining the first time you saw it, it'll still entertain you. OR, if you are into vicarious NEW WAVE thrills cos you weren't around when that happened (the way I get HIPPIE thrills second hand, having not been part of that generation), this would definately be a fun film for you to check out. It's hard to believe the film is over 30 years old, cos it holds up well.",1318982400,6,4093,4.421192052980133
4525450,5,B0051O0NEI,"I saw this movie when it first came out. What stuck in my head the most at the time and all these years since is the music. Before this bought this movie I had only seen it once since, it was never a movie that was made for those endless repeats on the movie channels.

Being a foreign film, most don't do well in the USA. It isn't a Hollywood production so it isn't a ""cookie cutter"" movie. If you like good foreign film, music that is more than the crap you find on the Top 40 lists today then you would like this movie. One major tip before you decide to buy, do a search on YouTube for the movie title, you can find some of the music and scenes from the movie to give you an clue if you would like it or not.",1314316800,4,712,3.8767123287671232
4525451,2,B0051O0NEI,"As already stated, this long awaited DVD version of a cult favorite was falsely advertised at 104 minutes, the running time of the full movie.  I was one of those who owned it on VHS as that was the only option here in the U.S.  That print was 94 minutes, with the final 10 omitted.  I was considering not purchasing the DVD, but since it was advertised at the full time I decided to take a chance.  Maybe that's what Olive Films was banking on.  Regardless, they misrepresented this item in a critical way.  I admit the film looks good, but it doesn't make up for not including the film's closing scene, which was quite an emotional conclusion.  I would return it but it's really not worth the effort.  As for the movie itself, it's one of my favorites, a peek into the British music scene at the beginning of the eighties.  The songs, the story, and the performances are great all around, however there are no extras (unless you count chapter selection an extra).  Since so little effort went into this release, I don't anticipate getting a complete DVD version anytime soon, if ever.  That's a real pity.",1314144000,26,1107,4.5125628140703515
4525452,5,B0051O0NEI,"I'm glad this movie finally got a US DVD release.  I first saw Breaking Glass late on USA network's Night Flight program in the early 1980s.  I recommend it for anyone interested in Punk Rock or New Wave as I was then.  The movie stands as a document the conditions that spawned real alternative music in England.  (Do increasing unemployment and the fear of expanding government sound familiar?  How about media saturated with throwaway celebrities and over produced dance music?)

The fact that lead actress Hazel O'Connor wrote and sang the soundtrack is one of the outstanding aspects of the movie.  She actually was an established musician in the UK prior to the film and headlined a gig with a little known group of lads from Birmingham known as Duran Duran as her opening act.

The story is pretty straightforward against the 1979-1980 post punk backdrop.  Kate is an idealistic, aspiring singer/songwriter who meets street hustler Danny while playing rough self-promoted gigs.  Danny helps Kate find a solid group of musicians, including Jonathan Pryce as the sax player.

After some fruitless gigs at a skinhead infested neighborhood pub, Danny and Kate seek more solid promotion.  They get better gigs playing clubs across the UK (there is a bit part played by Jim Broadbent as a striking train porter).  Danny goes further and blackmails a major label A&R man to see the band at their next gig in hopes of securing a record deal.  When the venue loses power and the band performs without, stirring the crowd into a chanting frenzy, the major label promoters sign the band.  Danny and Kate become romantically involved.

A gig at a ""1984"" (that's George Orwell's 1984) rally against big government turns violent when a mob of skinheads show up.  A wounded, dying boy tries to climb to Kate which affects her emotionally.  The record company executives, who view Danny as an obstacle to their control of Kate and the band, recommend the band take on a producer to help them push a full length record and capitalize on press coverage of the ill-fated rally and the band's appearance.

The producer becomes the wedge between Danny and Kate as Kate starts downing more pills to keep going under the pressures of recording, filming promotional videos, and touring.  Soon the band is at odds with Danny who quits mid-tour.  The drummer leaves and the sax player becomes a junkie.  In the end, Kate is a drug-addled, stadium-sized, superstar; the antithesis of what of her ideals.

Seeing Breaking Glass for the first time in a long time was a reminder, not just that it is a very good film, but what it was like when music like this was genuine and the contrived, hollow rubbish it became.

The DVD lacks any extras.  Perhaps an interview with Hazel O'Connor or a short documentary on the film would be nice.  But, I think the movie stands on its own very well.",1313539200,11,2865,4.772357723577236

4525456,4,B0051O0NEI,"In the PUNK film genre, this film shines as brightly as the Clash's Punk-Doc ""RUDE BOY.""

Hazel O'connor stars and writes her own songs.\

Phil Daniels (Quadrophenia) co-stars as the inexperienced manager who loses grip just as she needs a guiding hand.

Jonathan Pryce (Evita/Brazil/Something Wicked This Way Comes) supports the cast as a heroine addicted, deaf, Sax player.

James Broadbent (Topsy Turvy/Moulin Rouge) even makes a one line appearance [literally a walk-on part!] as the station conductor announcing a transit strike to the travellers!

But ""best"" little bit of trivia? This movie was produced by Dodi Fayed, yes, the very same as late Princess Dianna's boyfriend.

The  PLOT:

The metaphor of Breaking Glass is the fragile line between art, and fame. The punks were anti-""sell-out"" and we see our Artiste evolve from street-hardened punk, to [quite literally] a corporate music machine, in one of filmdom's most amazing concert bits. (if you think this concert ending is too far fetched,to be a real punk show...GARY NUMAN and the Tubeway Army concert performances were almost copied verbatim!]

The Phil Daniels anti-hero was a man who a: knows a good thing and how to showcase his find, and b: has inexperience in love and it washes over into the buisiness relationship.

AS he builds the band, the members trivialise his role, and edge him out in favor of selling records...the end is then a steamroller out of control. Without her manager, our heroine slips into a fragile existence and becomes broken glass.

4525458,5,B0051O0NEI,"Lovely punkette chanteuse Hazel O'Connor plays a blinder in the somewhat autobiographic role of Kate, desperate to succeed, whilst maintaining her ethics,  in the cut-throat music business.

Hazel's brilliant songs are enough to recommend this movie in its own right but, unlike some musicals, Breaking Glass is far more than just a vehicle to promote the artiste's work.  The sense of unease stoked by the rise of neo-Nazi and anarchic groups in late 70's/early 80's urban England and the shadier side of the music industry are expertly recreated here.

Furthermore, Hazel's depiction of the roller-coaster rise to stardom, resulting in mental breakdown, is impeccably observed. Why this hugely talented woman's career as an actress never really took off is a mystery to me!  She is also very ably supported by Phil Daniels, playing the role of his life and Jonathan Pryce as the sympathetic but messed-up junkie sax player.

Anyone familiar with Hazel's music (and I'm pleased to admite that I've seen her live on several occasions) will be delighted by the performances here, from the gutsy ""Blackman"", ""Give Me an Inch"" and ""Writing on the Wall"" to the astonishingly sensual ""Will You"" - surely one of the most evocative songs about love-making ever written?  Her final performance of ""Eighth Day"" sends shivers down your spine with its intensity and the final track - ""If Only"" provides an immensely powerful epilogue.

The UK release (PAL region 0 DVD) is well presented with adequate, if not spectacular extras (filmographies, trailer, stills etc.)

4525465,5,B0051O0NEI,"Definitely worth investing in if you are interested in pop music of the turn of the decade, when the punk of the 1970s was giving way to the post-punk or new wave ideas of the 1980s. This snapshot of England is rarely documented elsewhere, and captures a seedy world of exploitation, corruption, and hustling. It does however retain the glamour associated with pop stardom. The songs, mainly by Tony Visconti and Hazell O'Connor, are both appropriate and high quality, and enough of each number gets played in the film to obviate the need for a soundtrack album. Star spotters among you will notice not only Phil Daniels in a role which defined his later career, but also the young Derek Thompson from Casualty, Mark Wingett from The Bill, Jonathan Pryce from Brazil, Mark Wing-Davey from THHGTTG, and in a wonderfully violent role, Ken Campbell.
