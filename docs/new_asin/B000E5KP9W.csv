Howard Hawks directed. As is Hawks' signature this movie is a little chatty like ""Bringing up Baby"" and ""Monkey Business""

Roger Willoughby (Rock Hudson) is found in several precarious positions by his fiance. At one time he has his tie caught in Easy Muller's (Maria Perschy) zipper. In addition to this Abigail (Paula Prentiss) is spotted coming from his bedroom in her night attire.

Norm Alden plays John Screaming Eagle, a local Indian who speaks like Tonto, and sells many sacred things such as Custer's scalp.

In the end, they are carried away. You will be carried away also by this great comedy.",1425254400,,853,4.821917808219178
