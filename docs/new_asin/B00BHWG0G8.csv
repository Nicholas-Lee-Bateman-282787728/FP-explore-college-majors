5622065,5,B00BHWG0G8,"I really enjoy Star Trek: The Next Generation, although not my favorite rendition of the Star Trek genre. The transfer of the series to DVD in this rendition is acceptable but not fantastic.

Here's what the set includes:
Disc One:
Where Silence has Lease
Elementary, Dear Data (Data takes on his classic Sherlock Holmes persona)
The Outrageous Okana

Disc Two:
Loud as a Whisper
The Schizoid Man
Unnatural Selection
A Matter of Honor

The Measure of a Man
The Dauphin
Contagion
The Royale

A very good series that gets even better in later seasons.  Typically priced better for the budget conscious than earlier renditions of the series.  If you're are fan and don't have the earlier version already, pick this one up.",1397779200,3,1214,4.965346534653466

5622068,5,B00BHWG0G8,"Year 2 of Next Generation marked the loss of Dr. Crusher.  Character actress, Diana Muldaur was introduced as Dr. Kate Pulaski.  She was little more than the Dr. McCoy of Next Gen.  She believed that Data was just a machine; until she discovered otherwise.  Picard gets to find his own twin double six minutes in the future.  Riker has a new beard and an offer of his own star ship.  Data gets to see comic Joe Piscopo and plays Sherlock Holmes in the Holo-deck! He also goes on trial to prove that he is more than a ""toaster""!  We had to wait a year for the return of Dr. Crusher and things really change for the better in season 3!

Season two, shows us Star Trek: The Next Generation wasn't a fluke.  It did have staying power and the writing only gets better with each season.  There is a reason this show has a fans world wide.  It's well written, intelligent and doesn't pander to the lowest common denominator. You can watch this show tackle adult themes with your family and don't have to worry about changing the channel.",1373500800,11,1030,4.396825396825397

5622080,4,B00BHWG0G8,"I LOVE Star Trek: The Next Generation, and the product listed here is a good product for the price, but I was disappointed to discover that the episodes are NOT remastered in HD. I repeat, these episodes are NOT in HD. I usually pay more attention to things like that, but I suppose in the fervor of seeing the low cost, I jumped on it. It's still nice, but I would recommend the Trek experience in HD.",1453680000,,402,4.233766233766234
5622081,3,B00BHWG0G8,"The first season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" was a complete mess. So the next season had to be much better, right?

Well, yes and no. ""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 2"" was a definite improvement, especially since it lost much of the stifling smugness of the debut season... but it still wasn't terribly good, especially since it disposed with the likable Dr. Crusher in favor of the prickly sneering Dr. Pulaski. It has some truly classic, beautifully-written episodes (""Q Who,"" ""Elementary Dear Data""), but it also suffers from some staggeringly awful ones (""Up The Long Ladder,"" ""The Outrageous Okona"").

Since Dr. Crusher has vanished without a trace (don't worry, she comes back), the Enterprise welcomes a new doctor, Dr. Pulaski (Diana Muldaur), who turns out to be obnoxious, condescending, demanding and picks on Data (Brent Spiner) for fun. She also arrives just in time for Deanna Troi (Marina Sirtis) to inexplicably become pregnant, after being essentially raped by a ball of energy. Much drama ensues.

Among the other adventures the crew has: Geordi (Levar Burton) accidentally creates a self-aware hologram; a deaf ambassador is left helpless when his assistants are killed; a dying scientist wants Data to help him achieve immortality; an aging virus threatens Pulaski's life; a destructive computer virus runs rampant through the ship; Data befriends a young child from a self-destructing world; a future version of Picard is found adrift, having survived the Enterprise's destruction; and Riker gets jabbed by a toxic thorn that triggers a clip show.

There are some staggeringly awful episodes in this season, such as ""The Outrageous Okona"" (""If you put funny teeth in your mouth, and jump around like an idiot... that is considered funny"") or ""Up The Long Ladder"" (a ham-handed and irrational sermon on abortion, rife with grotesque Irish stereotypes). The show hadn't yet fully shaken off that first-season ridiculousness and preachiness, even though the quality of the overall season is substantially better.

... and yet, it also contains some staggeringly excellent classics, such as ""The Measure of a Man"" (in which Data must fight for his rights as an individual, rather than a piece of property) and ""Q Who"" (Q throws the Enterprise across the galaxy, warning them of a terrifying alien threat that is coming for them).

In other words, the second season of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" tended to seesaw wildly in quality, swinging between the sublime and the ridiculous. One thing was certainly improved -- there was greater depth and intelligence in these stories, and an increased awareness that moral and ethical issues do not (and should not) have an easy answer. Even the trickster Q reveals that he has more dimension and depth. Yes, there are some lapses (Riker killing his clones in ""Up The Long Ladder""), but most of the time we have deeper examinations of the Prime Directive, the nature of artificial life, and so on.

Most of the other episodes are... okay. Neither brilliant nor staggeringly bad, they have the Enterprise crew embarking on some solid one-off episodes that puts them up against Klingon sleepers, a computer virus, diplomatic problems, and so on.

It also succeeds in making the characters much more likable -- Picard has softened considerably into a more paternal figure, Riker's youth is explored somewhat, and we see more of what shaped Worf into the Klingon he is today. But the greatest development is to Data -- he continues to branch out with the eagerness of a child, from the idea of having a ""grandfather"" to his continuing interest in Sherlock Holmes. And of course, he ceases to be just the token android, and instead must present himself as a sentient individual with rights.

And of course, there is Pulaski. I can only assume that the writers thought she would be like Leonard McCoy from the original series, with her prickliness, irreverence and aversion to transporters. But her traits are so exaggerated that she just seems condescending and demanding, without any warmth or redeeming characteristics. And her almost-obsessive picking on Data is like watching someone repeatedly kicking a child.

""Star Trek: The Next Generation - Season 2"" is a vast improvement on the first season, but it was not yet the brilliant show it would later become. It's certainly worth watching, but some of the episodes should definitely be skipped.",1452816000,2,4426,5.084022038567493
5622082,5,B00BHWG0G8,"I purchased all of the STNG on DVD sets when they were first released. Great stories, good quality transfers and annoying cardboard cases -hard to open without tearing the cardboard.
I ordered this re-released set of volume 2 to determine what makes it different. As far as I can see, the only thing that changed is the packaging. If there is more to it than that, i will order the complete re-released STNG series just to get increased quality.
In my opinion Star Trek Next Generation is the best of all the Star Trek versions. Intriguing, thought provoking stories; nice special effects, characters with more depth, and the popularity was so high that 3 more series (Voyager, DS9,  Enterprise) and 6 movies followed.",1451433600,,718,4.837398373983739
5622083,5,B00BHWG0G8,"I've been wanting a complete set of Star Trek: The Next Generation for a long time, but the prices were just to high for the complete eight season set. When I saw this I felt....At last! Well, since to buy all these at around the price on them would be a good little investment, I decided to try the second and third season first which I did. As far as the second season set is concerned, it was just as I remember it being. Where as the first season was just getting it legs the second really started to show their stuff off. When I open this and checked out what I'd got, I know I'd be getting the rest of the seasons as the price was finally right. A good buy!",1450742400,,663,4.03030303030303
5622084,5,B00BHWG0G8,"What??? Another Star Trek you say, as my old man used to say while we were watching it on the tube, ""hey, you know that's happening right know"" I remember laying on the floor in front of the tube and when he started hacking on it I would think to myself, ""why don't you just die!"" Later on he did and I was sad. Anyway Star Trek The Next Generation back then was always my weekly pacifier, now I have the complete set and you don't naw-naw-naw! Seriously, watching them back to back is something we never dreamed was possible years ago and minus the commercial interruptions it's easy to fantasize being caught up in their world of bizarre beings and hallucinogenic alien environments. Escapism at its best, affordable and essential to the process of life itself! Buy it, enjoy it, tell others!",1446768000,,794,4.559440559440559
