5970928,5,B00F98FOPE,It's was truly good to see where the director took it as I had always wanted to know what happened next and there looks like maybe a part three either way love these movies the first however still has my heart :-),1389052800,,213,4.095238095238095
5970929,5,B00F98FOPE,"This is not only a well done and beautiful love story between two gay men, but it was wonderfully done!  All of the actors & actresses did a masterful job in their roles and I continue to see it again and again.  It is my hope that there will be a third edition to this story as I would love to know what the author/director envisions happening to R.J. and Chris from this point on.  Thank to the entire cast for such a great story and fantastic job putting it together on screen.",1388016000,,480,4.139784946236559
5970930,5,B00F98FOPE,"I was blown away by this movie. It is extremely well acted, the story is gripping and very romantic for those who love romance.  I have a lot of movies, but this one made it to my top 3 favorites instantly.  I have watched it three times since I received it.  You should first see the original movie The Falls prior to watching this movie so you can see how the relationship between Chris and RJ begins.  I hope there is another sequel to this movie.  I highly recommend this movie.",1387152000,43,482,4.252747252747253
5970931,5,B00F98FOPE,"I enjoyed the falls.  Great movie about the stresses of coming out in a religious RLDS church and home.  This movie takes up 5 years after The Falls.  The lead wants to reconnect with his old friend.  It is a great movie and if you liked the first movie The Falls you will love ""Testament of Love""  It is better than the first.",1386979200,4,327,4.126984126984127
5970932,4,B00F98FOPE,"I liked THE FALLS very much, but was worried about whether a sequel would work. Well, it works very well because, for the most part,RJ and Chris are given so much depth. Writer-director Jon Garcia presents the price everyone pays for the passionate reunion of RJ and Chris: Paul, RJ's sweet boyfriend; Chris's wife daughter, and father. It's RJ and Chris's flaws that make them particularly interesting. They can be cruel to the people around them -- and to each other. There's one climactic moment that stretches credibility, but otherwise this is good storytelling with rich characterizations. Garcia's direction is very slow paced, but Nick Ferrucci and Benjamin Farmer so fully inhabit their characters that the long takes allow these fine actors to make us feel RJ and Chris's confusion and anguish. Kudos, too, to the actors playing RJ's boyfriend and Chris's wife.",1386979200,4,871,5.0979020979020975
5970933,4,B00F98FOPE,"I so much liked the first movie"" The Falls"". I loved the second film,""The Falls : Testament of Love . I was so hoping that the two boys Chris and R.J. would find some happiness that seemed to elude them in the first film.  So when I learned that there would be a sequel,"" Testament of love"", I  was thrilled.. The acting was good on every body's part.

There was a lot of hurting in this film: Chris ! R.J.! Chris's wife! R.J.'s boyfriend! The erratic behavior of Chris and R.J. was understandable because people in love do not always act rationally.

For me, parts of the film was gut wrenching because I can identify with how hard it is to overcome your culture's social barriers in order to be with the one you love.

I am ready for movie # 3. Please, do not leave us not knowing what happens next.",1386892800,5,801,4.243421052631579
5970934,2,B00F98FOPE,"I'm going to assume that anyone considering this movie has already seen&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Falls/dp/B00996RSYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Falls</a>. If you haven't, you should. This is a sequel, and you need to have seen The Falls first. Therefore, I won't waste time telling who RJ and Chris are and what happened between them in the past.

I suspect that most fans of The Falls are going to love this one too, so you may want to stop reading now and just see the movie. It continues the gay Mormon theme of the original in a different setting.

It's five years later. Chris is back in Salt Lake, has been reabsorbed into Mormonism, has turned hetero through therapy and self-control, is making oodles of moolah as a pharma rep, is happily married and has a daughter.

RJ has not returned to Mormonism (although he still wears the underwear and believes most of the teachings), has a dreamboat lover named Paul who adores him, and is making ends meet writing for a magazine in Seattle.

RJ and Chris meet again for the first time at Rodney the stoner's funeral. RJ dumps Paul (a real catch and played by the best actor in either movie) and goes to Salt Lake to get Chris back. Much drama ensues. I'll stop there.

I LOVED The Falls - it was SO much better than the highly overrated Latter Days. But I have three problems with the sequel.

First, it adds nothing significant to the original, just recycles the same angst in a new town. Maybe gay Mormons need an endless series of Star Wars-like sequels and prequels, but this non-Mormon gay has had enough of it already.

Second, there's no believable attraction between RJ and Chris this time. It's compulsive, not erotic at all. Not one spark. Totally unbelievable, unless both guys are so neurotic now that they will do anything to be miserable. (Besides, the guy who plays Chris has gotten creepy looking - really weird eyes like a lizard).

Third, this sequel has the gall to set up for yet ANOTHER sequel, just as The Empire Strikes Back did. Lucas pulled it off, but Jon Garcia should have stopped at one.",1386892800,7,2126,4.821428571428571
5970935,4,B00F98FOPE,"The Falls is an affecting, touching film despite its flaws.  The script at times is creaky.  Some of the acting, especially the part of R.J.'s father, is unconvincing.  Certain scenes, even important ones, don't work because they are under realized, not carefully enough thought through.  Yet enough does work in it that it succeeds in being a better movie than many low budget gay films have been.  It has an emotional conviction running through it, a seriousness, that sustains it.  And some moments in it, even what might seem to be relatively unimportant ones, like that of the two guys riding the bus, looking at each other, being affectionate, glow with feeling.

The sequel, The Falls:  Testament of Love, is a better movie.  Though it is also marred, it is more emotionally complex, the script is tighter and more purposeful, and, perhaps in part because of the larger cast, it is better acted.  R.J. Smith, in a sense the movie's ""frame,"" or at least the character who begins and ends the film and upon occasion serves as its narrator, is still stolidly, monochromatically acted.  Most of the time, he appears stonily glum.  His boyfriend Paul is so much more animated and emotionally alive and responsive, that one might wonder what he sees in R.J. who responds to him often so coldly.

R.J. is the film's biggest problem.  His love for Chris appears almost obsessional, troubled and troubling.  His trip to Salt Lake City, what he does there, are disturbing, just a few steps away from his turning into a stalker.  It is unclear, at least to me, whether the film itself sees how excessively, and obsessionally, he is behaving, though by the end, in Chris's statement that ""he forgives him,"" one gains a clarity that might have been shown earlier if R.J. had been acted with more subtlety.  I am not judging R.J.  He does what he does.  I am just wondering if his character, the troubling side of it, is sufficiently portrayed, if he couldn't have been made less stiff and more emotionally conflicted, more self aware.  He doesn't seem to know how bizarrely he is behaving, as when, just to offer one instance, he insinuates himself into staying overnight at Chris's and his wife's home.

One can say, of course, that he does what he does out of his love for Chris, to free him from his internal crisis by forcing him to admit that he is gay both to himself and to others.  Yet his way of doing so at times borders on craziness, the lover in pursuit of his beloved no matter what, the selfish lover in short.  Does the film see this?  Or is it just me?  I don't know.

The complexity I miss in R.J. is, however, much more fully present in Chris.  Benjamin Farmer's performance of the character in the sequel is far more interesting than it was in the earlier film.  His inner struggle, his suffering, his anger, the ways in which his closetedness endangers his life and lives of others, all these and other emotions are visible at times merely in his eyes.  It is sensitive work that carries the film over its rougher moments.

Much of the supporting cast is also good, Chris's wife in particular, and some of the minor characters, like Aaron, another closeted and married former missionary, have scenes that are more convincing and resonant than any moments in the earlier movie.  A few of the actors are still weak.  R.J.'s father remains insufficiently depicted, for instance.  But, since this is largely Chris's movie, it succeeds much more consistently than The Falls.

Of course, this is still a low budget movie, and moments in it betray that fact.  The anniversary party looks to have been attended by about ten people, even though it means to fill a large hall.  It is clear that much of it was filmed in the same location.  There are gaps in the plot's logic that I can't elaborate upon here without giving away too much.  The ending feels to me too tacked on, its openness less a gesture toward a more generous future than uncertain about who these two main characters, said to love each other, might be and become.  Such uncertainty, one might say, is true to life.  Fine.  But the ending nonetheless strikes me as abrupt.

Still, like its predecessor, the movie carries with it real conviction.  The best of Testament of Love is far better than the earlier film, better acted, much better written, and better shot.  It is a stronger movie, serious in ways that far too many low budget gay movies don't aspire to be.  Though it is flawed as well, it is even more moving, and what it is concerned with goes much deeper.  The movie's religious themes, if often still superficial, nonetheless give it a resonance it would lack without them.  But the heart of it doesn't lie in them.  That is fortunate, I think.  This is not Bresson we are watching, after all.  It lies in the relationship between the two men.

At least one person in that relationship must dig deep inside himself to endure, to save himself and to love others, in particular to love a man openly and freely.  One might wish at the end, perhaps, that the man he has loved and apparently loves still, R.J., had reached as deeply inside himself as Chris must do, to find himself as clearly (however differently) as Chris has begun to.  It's an uneven film, then, yet, despite its small and not so small failures, moving and worth seeing.",1386806400,23,5321,4.629273504273504
5970936,5,B00F98FOPE,"Such is the transcendent sentiment which sustains this second installment of the superb drama, ""The Falls."" Everything about this movie rings true--absolutely pitch-perfect. The acting is excellent, as it was in the first installment. The movie reinforces my belief that independent cinema comes from a place that more commercial ventures have abandoned, that place being ""reality."" I was surprised, watching the director and cast interviews on the DVD extras, that Mormons (or ex-Mormons, perhaps) were not a part of the script or cast: the result of a perfect screenplay. I hope that Mr. Garcia, Mr. Ferrucci, and Mr. Farmer, as well as the rest of the cast, return with a third movie so that I do not have to say goodbye to this authentic and romantic drama. .",1386720000,24,763,4.96875

5970975,5,B00F98FOPE,"I can only write this and am posting this as a comment on The Falls trilogy. I simply do not believe they can be addressed individually.

The Falls trilogy provides the space to cover with depth and subtlety the difficulties all too many encounter accepting themselves and being open about it, especially when their social surroundings (family, friends, location, religion, etc) make the process more difficult than it need be. Thanks to everyone involved for The Falls' thoughtful depiction of the subject.

Beautifully conceived and acted and with music perfectly matched to the film, The Falls trilogy is a poignant wonder. LGBT individuals as well as their family and friends should not miss it.",1499040000,2,699,5.12280701754386

The Falls: Testament of Love has a slightly higher budget.(although still minuscule) makes this a more polished movie then The Falls, however not to diminish the exceptional  creativity of the first movie.  The music is haunting and incredibly brilliant.  The acting continues to be superb. The story flows with passion, compassion and amazing insight and truth.  Although like The Falls, this movie may only appeal to a niche audience, thank god that someone had the motivation and courage to bring to life the tragedy of the consequences of Corporate religion. Having experienced many of the issues that are addressed in this film, The Falls: Testament of Love and The Falls, I am so grateful to know that I am not alone in my experience of the abuse of the Mormon cult.
This is a story that disparately needed to be told..

5971137,3,B00F98FOPE,"The concept of this film is better than its realisation. ""The Falls: Testament of Love"" is about two gay/bisexual L.D.S. Mormons, who had been missionary companions, together having an homosexual love affair on their mission, who were dismissed, who enjoyed a leisurely amourous gay road-trip before parting seemingly for good, and who now reunite five years later. The premise of sexual ardour reignited, love coming out of remission, and how that impacts the life of the one of the two young men who has married, is the stuff of a first-rate romantic epic. However, as good as the concept is, the slow pacing and languid timing of this plodding video-movie is anything but adequately cinematic. Truly banal, inept dialogue does not help things along one little bit. The acting per se, for all of that, mostly is quite fine, however numerous the faults of the script and direction are.

The film, given its subject and the relentless sincerity of it all, is worth seeing and keeping for later (much, much later!) viewing again. It helps that neither the original ""The Falls"" (QC Cinema QCC-343 being the North American DVD edition viewed) nor this sequel, ""The Falls: Testament of Love"" (of which QC Cinema QCC-378 is the DVD edition viewed), makes light of Mormonism. There is a successful attempt, indeed, to portray Mormonism authentically and without undue mockery or vituperation. (This assessment coming from the writer of these lines, who directly experienced life and Utah family heritage, dissolute Grandpa's ongoing discreet polygamy and all, in childhood within the pagan L.D.S. cult.) Such restraint counts among the positive assets of this surely made-for-video movie.

Despite all of these good elements, many will find this sequel to be intolerably dreary, given its pace and also the inept yammering that constitutes the dialogue. As for any nudity, the movie does show some bare skin, but the only full-frontally naked display occurs in a brief glimpse of the less handsome (and less physically fit, even somewhat pudgy) of the Mormon male duo while he is showering. The best recommendation is to see the first of the two films and, if one really reacts positively enough to it, then (and only then) to see the follow-up, gearing up oneself for a lot of earnest boredom along the way. It is nice, after all, to know what happens later (i.e., after the time of the first film's action) to these appealing, good-looking, and intensely serious lads.",1447718400,,2464,5.02200488997555

At the starting point in far too many families, the pressure put on us by others to be what/who they say we are, or to be as they say we ought to be, simply because they decide that is the truth when it isn't.....a father says, ""My 'faith' shows me the truth in all its absoluteness and YOU must follow that."" Such repression and blockage of the human spirit create psychological, personal and often destructive results. The second installment of the film is long, and at points the viewing is heavy. But the lesson that comes from it is that deep, sincere, passionate and abiding love is there for us to accept and our inner nature guides us to embrace it.. We must discover that our own creative presence is as worthwhile as that of anyone else.

5971196,4,B00F98FOPE,"**Please note that there will be spoilers**

This is a sequel to ""The Falls.""  If you have not seen the first movie, it's a love story between two Mormon missionaries who have tried, in vain, to lead Christian lives.  Upon meeting on their mission, they fall in love and discover more about themselves than they realized existed.  The movie ends without our knowing the disposition of their relationship, though.  It's assumed that they moved on to live happily ever after.

Apparently, that was not the case.  This continuation picks up five years later, and we find R.J. and Chris in different places in their lives.  R.J. came to terms with his sexuality and moved from Idaho to Washington to lead a full life.  He finds what he believes is love and starts to live a regular life, holding an editor job and even writing books.

Chris, on the other hand, never came to terms with his sexuality.  He went through conversion therapy, which led him to get married to a beautiful woman, both of whom had a daughter.  He lives what is supposed to be the perfect life based on what he's learned from childhood and what's he's been inculcated with by his religion.  He does everything right.

The death of a mutual friend brings them back to Portland, which was the setting of the original movie.  R.J. still loves Chris, but Chris rebuffs him at every turn, instead making it clear that he's straight, happily married, and a devoted father.  They spend some awkward time with each other while in Portland, but they both return to their lives in their respective cities.  But it doesn't end there for R.J.

Here's my breakdown of the movie on a few levels:

ACTING

For a low-budget movie with no-name actors, the acting was good.  At the least, everyone--with the exception of Chris's mother--struck me as believable.  Between the lovebirds, Chris is a much better actor.  In contrast to the first movie, he's intense, guarded this time around.  He's struggling against sexual predispositions, and you can tell it in his eyes.  He comes off as cold and unfeeling except when interacting with his family.  But in moments of weakness, his heart aches for R.J., and you can tell it by his expressions and gestures.  There is a memorable scene in which he leaves R.J. to go to his room, sits down on his bed, and starts to cry because of the yearning and ache he clearly feels for R.J. even after five years and a perfect marriage.

R.J. is capable, but he could use some acting help.  He comes off as stiff, but not because his character should be that way; it seems that he as an actor is stiff and stale.  In the first movie, it was noticeable, but at least it worked for what he was trying to portray:  the good little Mormon boy who operated in the sandbox, never to have deviated.  For the sequel, it doesn't work well.  He's freer now, more willing to explore everything in life.  He dresses in a contemporary fashion.  The stale acting doesn't work.  It doesn't fully take away from his credibility; it just makes it a little harder to follow him.  I will say, though, he does brighten up when in scenes with Chris's character.

Even though she wasn't a main character, I do want to highlight Chris's wife.  She has some moments of incredulity, though this could be related to the fact that she's a clueless Mormon wife willing to do anything to keep her husband satisfied, but she strikes me as a capable actor.  You can really see her shine when she discovers that Chris is in a tryst with R.J.  Her begging Chris to remain with his family, to not abandon her and their daughter, to keep everything in the status quo was heartbreaking.  You really feel the betrayal.

PLOT

It's a bit trite.  You can go on Netflix and find several Mormon-coming-of-age-by-discovering-what's-really-fun-in-life type of movies.  And it's always the same:  two white guys, a mammoth worth of pent-up sexual emotions, ""Happy Days""-like hairstyles, and laughable bible verses coming out of their mouths every other sentence.  The last movie covered that pretty well, but we only get a portion of it in this iteration; it's primarily through Chris and his family.

There are deviations, however.  We have R.J. who gives the impression of being obsessed with Chris, but it doesn't come off as creepy.  Instead, it comes off as incredibly sad and sweet at the same time.  Here you have a fellow driving 900 miles just to see the same person who rejected him two weeks before at the funeral of their mutual friend.  He's desperate without seeming desolate.  He's hopeful without seeming deluded.

PRODUCTION

On the one hand, it's clear that this is a low-budget movie.  There aren't loud explosions or scenes full of people in flying through the air while kung fu fighting.  You don't see a sea full of zombies swarming the land.  There are no superheroes blasting their way through the enemies.  It's just two decent-looking guys, a drab city (Salt Lake City), and a cast of regular-looking supporting actors.  Throw in a cheap motel where R.J. stays, and you get to understand why the director has to rely on other aspects to carry this movie to fruition.

He does this capably, though not perfectly.  He properly leans on the actors to move each scene through, allowing people to focus on their intensity with each other as well as on their struggles against their own internal emotions.  It really takes the focus away from the production quality.  In a few cases, he actually uses the fact of a low budget to his advantage, namely with the cheap, dirty motel where R.J. chooses to stay while visiting Salt Lake City.  Putting aside that the producers likely couldn't afford anything better, you wouldn't want him staying in a four-star hotel.  He doesn't have the salary for it, but it would also detract for the somber attitude (about not being able to be with Chris) that he needs to have to be convincing.

OVERALL

If you can forgive the plodding sometimes, you'll find that this movie is excellent for being low-budget.  The focus is on the feelings between the protagonists, the internal war between them, the fight against their deep-seated religious beliefs, confusion about where they stand in life if they choose to abandon everything that they've learned from their religion.  There isn't a neat dnouement, but it's pretty clear what happens after the movie ends.  I definitely recommend giving the movie your attention.",1430697600,4,6414,4.74027149321267

I am an getting my MFA in acting and a lot of the techniques that I've been taught in school were very present in this movie which made it believable and honest to watch. The first time that they were able to kiss in this movie was filled with so much love, desire, tension, and need, that it lept off the screen and straight into your heart. The cast of the movie did a wonderful job. The leads were so believable as two people who were deeply in love and were then separated by forces beyond their control. Their performances were tender, warm, and heartbreaking all at once. The supporting cast members created a living, breathing, functioning, backdrop of people who supported and loved them, people who didn't understand them, and people who flat out hated them. Bravo.

The performances of the two leads are deeply moving and I admired the cohesion between this film and its excellent prequel, The Falls. Indeed, to fully appreciate the power of either film, one needs to see both. As in The Falls, the way the director both respects and challenges the Mormon faith is very sensitively handled, as are the love scenes, which are beautifully acted and filmed. That insightful sensitivity to the innate human element in both religious love and romantic love gives the film a unique integrity whose power builds as it unfolds and lingers long after viewing. The film IS a testament of love--of many different kinds of love. Interestingly, it ends with an opening for yet another sequel, which I hope will be made. Thank you, director Jon Garcia, for this special film, and kudos to Nick Ferrucci and Benjamin Farmer for their brave and nuanced performances in the lead roles, and to the actors playing Emily and Aaron.

5971219,5,B00F98FOPE,"This is the second of a two DVD story.  It follows the first, ""The Falls"" - Love is not a sin.  Many people believe that Heterosexuals meet and fall in Love and have a sexual relationship to produce children, while homosexuals meet for the sole purpose of having a sexual relationship.  'Testament' shows that isn't always true.  In 'Testament' we follow the lives of RJ and Chris five years after they separate in 'Not a sin'.  'Testament' explores the depth of their love, and the torment that is caused by family and churches who do not understand the love that can be experienced by two men for each other, and the damage that can be caused by that ignorance.  I would recommend every person, straight or gay to watch both of these DVD's to help them understand how true, deep and unending love can hurt those who experience that love, but are unable to express their love because of the ignorance of their families and/or the church to which they belong.

5971221,4,B00F98FOPE,"This is the sequel to The Falls, and follows up five years after our pair had met and become lovers while on their Mormon mission. While one has gone on to try and live his life being true to his nature -- the other has accepted a ""second chance"" from the church to stay in the fold, so long as he adheres to the Mormon way of life. He tries, by marrying and having a child, and things are going along without chaos until he is reunited with his former lover while both are attending the funeral of a friend they made while on their mission together.

Most of the fireworks in this film are of the internalized variety as both characters struggle with the feelings they're having: one realizes that while he's in a good relationship with a good man, it's not the man he loves; and the other slowly comes to recognize that he cannot go on living the lie the Church has insisted he live to remain in good standing.

Like the first film, this one is well-written and acted, and draws the viewer into the emotional chaos these characters are living, as they try to decide if life means for them to be together.",1425081600,,1106,4.3125
5971222,4,B00F98FOPE,"The rating should be somewhere between ""I like it"" and ""I love it"". The film is well directed, well cast again, and the dialogue was spot on. The story behind the story in this ""continuation film"" on this theme reveals the rules of Mormonism, either obey or be disciplined and/or excommunicated by an arbitrarily elected church court. One bowed to the church court, which is commanded to safeguard the purity, integrity, and good name of the church; one did not based on a individual desire not to be forced to denounce himself and his gayness.

Jon Garcia, both director and writer of both films deserves credit to present the subject matter without disgracing any fundamental values or beliefs. His perspective portrayed on film cannot be construed as an attack on these grounds. However, he displays in a respectful manner not only the opposition of such beliefs but also their conflict, self-denial, personal individuality and freedom of thought through two male individuals.",1424390400,,979,5.080745341614906

But it actually turned out much better than I expected. The acting is better, the plot much more plausible, and with real feelings but without too much dramatization. I especially liked how Chris slowly warmed up to RJ after the reunion. Yes, the moving is slow moving, but that's life. And I would like to believe that the slow pace is deliberate on the director's part, so we the audience all get to experience how it feels when you watch your own life slowly falls apart. Kind of reminds me of another great movie ""Shawshank Redemption"".

The Falls:  Testament of Love is probably one of the better sequels I've seen to a movie.  I would even go as far to say that I liked it more than the original movie -- which is saying a lot, because I really liked the first movie. I was delighted to find out there was a sequel.

I think because of the way the first movie ended, the audience expects the sequel to be all about R.J. and Chris as a happy couple.  In fact, the movie is more about them as individuals and the struggles they face.  While R.J. has decided to remain true to who he is and stay out of the closet, Chris feels the pressure of his family and religious faith and attempts to retract back to the person who he was -- or the person he knew others wanted him to be.  In doing so, he completely cuts R.J. out of his life without warning, and meets a woman who he decides to marry, and they have a child together.  He has the perfect marriage, the perfect house, the perfect job -- at least it appears that way to anyone who is looking in from the outside.

R.J. and Chris see each other again when their friend Rodney passes away and they attend his funeral.  This opens a can of worms for Chris, because he quickly finds out that seeing R.J. again only confirms who he is, and has brought back all the feelings he had when they were together.  Chris is initially angry with R.J. for showing up back up in his life and making him confused about who he is, once again; but comes to understand that he can't go on living a lie anymore.

This movie was well-written, well-acted, as was believable, as the first one was.  Nick Ferrucci and Ben Farmer are both phenomenal.  You really feel the struggle and the love these characters go through.

I really enjoyed watching this movie and highly recommend it.  Also - the special features on the DVD are awesome!  It has behind the scenes footage and featurettes of both movies.  There's also bloopers, deleted scenes, outtakes, and the Q&A session of the screening.  This DVD is well worth purchasing!",1421366400,,2038,4.358090185676392

It's a shame a movie like this isn't honored at the Academy awards because the 2 leads could definitely garner a nomination.  The directing was good and it, all in all, was a good movie.  However, the ending is extremely disappointing.  It builds to this crescendo and then... that's it.  It definitely stops short and leaves you wanting more.  There is no resolution to the situation and no promise of things to come.  I can only say that to make this movie more than a 3 star, it better have another sequel.  And if questions aren't answered in that 3rd installment, then the whole movie experience was a waste of movie, with the exception of the 2 wonderful leads.  Especially the one with the dark hair (sorry, don't remember names).  It doesn't get much better than that and you can't help but root for him through the entire movie.

  The wife in this movie as well as the parents are so superbly played , they capture the genuine love the Mormons have and yet lay them out for the next step of Healing work that has come to be fulfilled .
  I feel the writer must have been through this and that the actors take on the decency of what good Mormons are and sadly what some devote morons are.

5971296,3,B00F98FOPE,"It was interesting to see a continuation of the The Falls with The Falls: Testament of Love.  The sex scenes are not overdone and fit in well emotionally and sequentially.  RJ and Chris really look like they are meant to be together, and you have to really feel sorry for Paul and Emily.  The dynamics between religion and sexuality and how it all played out was not surprising for me, but they do reach out to people who feel like they have lived similar struggles or whom like to watch these struggles and how they unfold in video format.  This movie, like the first one, is slow in pace appropriately.  It might be too slow for some, but it was just right for me.

The ending was contrived in the sense that it allowed for possible continuation for additional sequel(s), but the story got to the point where it really should have been a happy ending.  However, even though a happy ending would have been more cohesive for this storyline, it could have been too controversial for religious groups.  Counter-intuitive to that though, how many people in conservative religious groups are watching or even aware of this movie though?  It's not like it's on primetime TV or was in mainstream theaters in the US.

Side note:  I have the DVD of The Falls Part 1:, which says ""Another Testament of Love"" on it, which is confusing because it's the first one in the series, so how is it ""another""?",1406073600,3,1390,4.542168674698795

The other one missed the relationship deeply, but found a new person in his life who actually cared for him, but still not satisfied he tried to re-connect with his initial lover - who at first sticks to his wife and child, and then seems to ""come around"" - at which time I had enough. My take: ... - A COMMITMENT is A COMMITMENT - which two people give to each other, and only those two people should be able to retract. The movie shows ""FAILED COMMITMENTS"" again and again - based just on sexual desire (really ??) - to the point where it was too frustrating for me to watch.",1404777600,9,979,4.355191256830601

5971299,5,B00F98FOPE,"Only after I watched the special features did I learn this film was two hours long.  That I had to be informed of this fact by the Q&A feature is a credit to Jon Garcia and the cast.  When a film is this great--with a truly gripping story and excellent performers--time just flies effortlessly.

The danger of doing a sequel is more about not living up to the viewers' imagined continuation of the story than it is about just making a poor film.  At the end of The Falls, I was left wanting more and I created my own plausible story.  Testament of Love far surpassed what I ever would have imaged. This sequel can also stand on its own as a film if the viewer did not see the original.  Enough of the backstory is woven into Testament of Love so that no viewer will feel lost.

The original film was about forbidden romance and coming of age within the structure of religion.  The sequel is about the truth. An important loose end--the question:  what happened with Rodney?-- is resolved early in the film and drives all that is to come, is the death of Rodney.  Rodney's funeral brings Chris and RJ back together after 5 long years without contact.  Also Rodney's message from The Falls--to live a little--is the inspiration for all that happens.

The truth is front and center when RJ returns from Rodney's funeral and will not say ""I love you"" back to Paul, his current boyfriend.  RJ later breaks up with Paul as an act of honesty.  The actor portraying Paul gives an especially fine and nuanced performance.  Paul's facial expressions say so much.

Much of the rest of the film follows Chris as he works to catch up to his own truth.  With RJ's provocation, Chris is forced to think about the lies he is living.  RJ arrives in Salt Lake City and lands on Chris's doorstep.  This sets up a chain of events that finally leads to resolution for everyone, including Chris's parents.

After repeated viewings, I have to say Testament of Love is one of my all time favorite films.  Everything is better about the sequel then the original.  Acting and production values are far better in this sequel, but it is still the story that grabs me and won't let go.

So even after two hours I was left wanting more.  Hopefully, that means another sequel in which Chris uses that plane ticket to Seattle.  I think a wedding is in order and maybe adoption...and maybe both Chris and RJ can dedicate their lives to working to make sure young gay people never contemplate suicide.",1403049600,7,2467,4.502252252252252

The first movie was astonishingly true to how it feels to discover and affirm a gay identity and experience first love.  The sequel was richer and the actors even better at inhabiting the characters.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that some of my formulaic expectations for a sequel were wrong.  The the writer and actors manage to keep you guessing at exactly how the story will unfold.  I might have found more words for the actors to speak given the turbulence of feelings that bedevil them, but this does not detract from the memorable, overall effect.

What I think is most important is that this movie could have been a heterosexual love story and been just as true.  The added complexity of the Mormon context, wholly intolerant of gays, is one of many that could raise the stakes when love hurtles through all identities and affinities in its flight to target.",1402272000,4,939,4.723926380368098

All of the Mormonisms were spot on, the dedication to family and God, service to the church, the eternal family.

5971334,5,B00F98FOPE,"Just finished watching ""The Falls - Testament of Love"" released by Breaking Glass Pictures.
""The Falls - Testament of Love"" is the unexpected sequel to ""The Falls"" - which follows the semi-tragic romance of former Mormon missionaries RJ and Chris five years after their interrupted mission and love affair.
Life has not treated RJ or Chris very well. Or perhaps its better to say that RJ and Chris have not treated themselves or others very well in the five years since they returned from a road trip that was inspired by tales from a friend they meet while seeking converts on their mission.
At the end of the road trip, Chris decides he needs treatment to become and ""ex-gay"" mormon and live a ""normal"" life which includes marriage and starting a family.
RJ now writes for a magazine and has a boy friend who has met his parents.
Everything goes down hill for both RJ and Chris when they are tenatively reunited at a friend's funeral.
RJ becomes a man driven by a need to know why Chris abandoned him five years ago without even saying goodbye. Chris doesn't want to provide any answers; so RJ breaks up with his boyfriend - wanting some time apart to resolve some ""issues."" At least RJ's boyfriend has enough common sense to tell him ""I'm not waiting for you.""
RJ and Chris eventually reunite in the bedroom; forcing Chris to make some hard choices and attempt to straighten out the sheer mess he made not only of his life, but his wife's, daughter's, and family's lives as well.
Are RJ and Chris reunited by the end of this movie? Now, now gentle readers, that would be telling. I will say that director and writer John Garcia has done an excellent job and has done something that is rare, a sequel that outshines the original.
I suspect that there is a third movie waiting to tell the further story of RJ's and Chris' lives. Hopefully John Garcia will tell it.
Highly Recommended!
Five Stars!

Postscript: I received some inquries about whether or not I remained in contact with Elders Dalahanse and Butler. Sadly no. While my goal was to learn more about the Mormon faith since I enjoy studying religions, their joint goal was to convert me; though I do hope they enjoyed our weekly conversations. I will say - and hopefully this won't get them in trouble - that Elders Dalahanse and Butler once shocked me by ordering a hot chocolate at the Barnes and Noble cafe. Something that I thought was one of the forbidden foods for the Mormon Faith. I also suspect that President Green probably discouraged them from remaining in contact with me. It's very rare that the President of a Mormon Temple feels the need to personally interact with the individual who has been discussing the faith with two of his Elders. I don't think I was what President Green was expecting...a Jew who was comfortable discussing various world religions...LOL...[And I doubt that President Green would approve of me having watched these two outstanding movies.]",1397174400,,2940,4.6976744186046515

This movie needed some serious editing, for starters.  I'm a big fan of ""The Falls"", the movie to which this is the sequel.  That movie was a pleasant surprise: well-acted, poignant, provocative, humorous and heartbreaking.  This sequel doesn't even come close.  There are a couple of scenes near the end that are just buttock-clenchingly preposterous.  The cast is attractive and talented, and the story is interesting.  But, this was a big disappointment, especially considering how good the first movie was.",1396483200,3,644,5.0

5971338,5,B00F98FOPE,"In the first film The Falls, the producer made no bones of the fact that it was made on a shoestring. Despite that admission it was remarkably well made and proved that low-budget does not equal low quality. Another point is that sequels in Hollywood land generally mean another chance to rehash the first film and make even more money at it. In this case that was obviously not the motivation. Anyone who has seen Yossi (as the sequel to Yossi and Jagger) will know that sequels can stand on their own merits. This film builds on the first one. The scenery is a lot plusher and the dialogue a lot more polished.

Dialogue however has to be coupled with a sincere competent actor or it is just reading (I refer the reader to Leather). In this film we have competent actors able to convey the emotional turmoil that the situation demands. Because the same actors are used from the first film the director may not have had an opportunity to bring in some more authentic heavy weight actors - I'm thinking of RJ's father in this case and Chris's mother gives a fairly run of the mill performance. Thankfully they are only in supporting roles and don't have to carry a scene.

In the original film, The Falls, Chris played the tense, perfect son. He also wanted to be one of the `righteous of God'. This took a back door when he discovered the pleasures of the flesh however and the two young men decide to tour for six months before returning to their new lives. Or so RJ thought. As soon as they separated, despite the closeness, Chris just disappeared. Never answered his letters, returned calls or made any attempt to contact him. They just separated. RJ decided to live as an openly gay man with a nice but rather uninspiring personal trainer. Chris rebelled in a different way and gave free reign to his internalised homophobia, married and had a child and became `one of the righteous of God'. This was after completing a course (at his father's insistence) on reparative therapy to cure him of his gayness. Unsurprisingly it was a success and the perfect life of a well paid pharmaceutical salesman followed. His life ticked all the boxes. As far as Mormon society was concerned he was on the right path to glory.

Until Rodney, the pot smoking Iraqi veteran died and they were both invited to attend the funeral. They had both kept in touch with him in varying degrees. Both attend but Chris presents a wall of stone and, apart from the bare minimum civilities that the situation calls for, he says nothing and reveals nothing - apart from the fact that he is `cured' , married with a child and hopes RJ follows likewise. They part awkwardly. On his return to Seattle, RJ asks his partner to separate for a while as he has things to sort out. He decides to return to Salt Lake City to confront Chris. And that is where the journey for Chris begins. Because it is really about Chris's journey both psychologically, spiritually and emotionally.

It is at this point too that some issues are raised:

Does RJ have the right to barge like a bowling ball back into the life of someone he last saw 5 years ago? Does he have the right to break up a family? Who gave him that right? Is he being emotionally torn apart? You don't get that impression. The trauma seems all one sided as RJ has nothing to lose. His life and job are safe back in Seattle -it is Chris who is forcefully presented with a fait accompli. It is his family which is drawn into the unfolding drama. The film presents these issues - and not in black and white terms. There are a lot of grey borders and the characters reflect these ambiguities. The emotional state of Chris's wife at her situation is very well played. She doesn't care if he is gay but does not want to be abandoned.

To go on would need a spoiler alert before every line. Suffice to say that this film is well worth watching if you are interested in these issues. For me the issues are largely academic as I was never in such a situation but it is well known that most gay men are in fact married and either internalise that homophobia and join the extreme right wing politically or a fundamentalist religion. Many Muslim men enforce the rules of their religion strictly to keep the wife as far from them as possible all in the name of being `one of the Righteous of the Lord' - so it is a burning issue for some.",1395964800,2,4349,4.443609022556391
5971339,4,B00F98FOPE,"This is the sequel for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Falls/dp/B00996RSYM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Falls</a>. It is a close continuation of the original story, with a gap of about five years. RJ is now living as an out gay man, with a boyfriend. He even introduces his boyfriend to his parents. Chris, on the other hand, is completely closeted, married, with a little girl. He has been through ""reparative therapy,"" but is clearly dealing with feelings that keep breaking out, such as sexual dysfunction with his wife. The two meet again at the funeral of Randy, the pot-smoking vet from the first movie. RJ breaks up with his boyfriend, and takes a business trip to Salt Lake, to attempt a reunion with Chris.

As other reviewers have already stated, the production values are low, a symptom of the funding level available for independent productions like this. Nick Ferrucci (""RJ"") has a rather deadpan delivery. This is somewhat elviated by his puppy-dog eys, with give every closeup an empathic look. Benjamin Farmer (""Chris"") is the opposite: his earnestness gives him a college-drama look. Neither one is mature as an actor. I hope that some of that will come if there is a third installment in the storyline. While the ending is realistic, it wouldn't be consdiered a happy ending, or at least not the one that you might expect.

The reason I headline this as heavy-handed is that it really piles on the preaching of ""love everyone and let them live authenticaly."" And i definitely mean preaching. it is even stated explicitly, as when RJ says that ""we are victims."" There is some sexual content, both heterosexual and homosexual, as well as one strong masturbation scene, none of which are explicit. There is also some brief nudity, including one scene of full, very visible, frontal male nudity, though in non-sexual situations. i wouldn't advise showing it to children.

I can see this film being very useful as a conversation starter. It deals a lot with the harm that comes from enforced conformity. Chris's wife, Emily, is clearly devastated by her role, one that she hadn't known about, as a ""cure"" for Chris. The closet has victims, and not just the one that lives in it.",1395705600,2,2240,5.081521739130435

Latter Days was great and the First Falls: Love Is Not a Sin, was good but, This Second Falls one, Testament Of Love is the best. I feel the casting was excellent, the story line was by far the best of all three and the acting was about as good as one can get in a movie. There is no way you can watch this and not get some emotion involved what you are watching. If you liked the first two (Latter Days and The Falls: Love Is Not A Sin) you will for sure like this one ""The Best Sequel"" you will see. Glad I purchased it with NO regrets.

5971341,4,B00F98FOPE,"The first film was very good, setting the stage for the two main characters. I tried watching this in a rather bad mood, in this case, very bad move! The outcome was bittersweet and heartbreaking, my question is, will there be a third chapter? In the start  I was kinda angry with Chris, esp. with how he treated RJ. Even though I haven't given it a 2nd viewing...yet, I've analyzed Chris' behavior more carefully and can empathize with him and his issues easier. The church, his family and society shoved him back in his closet, forcing him to reject his true sexuality, and attempt to be ""normal"". After a reviewing, I will elaborate more.

Update:3-29-14)For those who read my initial review, I won't erase it, this update is also a revision. Yes, Chris made me angry at the start, but his tune quickly changed after his feelings for Rj were rekindled. Chris' family, with little exception made me angrier, refusing to accept the truth, but I liked how Rj's father put Chris' father in his place, trying to be tactful, but bluntly honest. This time, the ending made me cry, because in some ways, been there, done that: my first girlfriend/fiancee, was not my attempt at converting from gay to straight, but actually proved what I've pretty much known my whole life, I'm actually bisexual. I didn't expect to fall in love with her, and neither did she, but it happened, but two many things went wrong, and we had to break up, but what tears me up is why it couldn't have been more civilized and respectful. That I do regret. I wasn't co-erced or pushed into starting a relationship with her, but we discovered we were better matched as friends. I understood why the ending happened that way, but it reminded me a little of my recent situation, without all the strings. Thank you, J.G., part three, please!",1394928000,2,1807,4.64375

While I will forever prefer ""Latter Days"", I commend Joe Garcia for refusing to end the story with only one film.  Life does not end at the end of a movie. Ferruci is the best of the lot; I was entirely shocked to find that his supposedly ""straight Mormon"" boyfriend had shaved his genitals for the only brief frontal nudity scene!

It moves thoughtfully, carefully, and the conflicts finally boil over. Many times I wasn't certain how this movie was going to end. There was no foregone conclusion throughout it until we come to the very end. It's a moving, impressive movie. I really cared for the struggles that these two men go through. They hurt, they deal with heavy questions and they resolve their issues. I was impressed with the beauty of this movie. The acting is so good as the characters come to terms with their own sexuality, their own personal situations, jobs, lives, families. Watch this film.

As in the first movie, this one is excellently acted by supreme artists and it is powerfully written and directed by Jon Garcia, who just got it better the second time around.  Sequels rarely live up to the original but this is the exception here.  It was absolutely superb and surpassed my expectations.  There were many tears shed watching this film because it speaks to so many people, not just gay people, but to everyone on so many different levels.  One can identify with all of the major characters to some degree or another.  The acting is truly superb which is so rare for a low budget gay film.  The sound is a lot better this time around than the first.  The cinematography is beautiful.  The whole film is riveting because one is rooting for everyone....all the characters make one feel love, betrayal, pain, denial, sorrow, hope.

I would have given it one star, claiming to hate it, but when you say you hate something, your usually like it underneath, sometimes. I don't, in any way want to give that impression, however. While the acting is not bad, and the story is put together well, I think it really ought to be listed in programs designated as part of a recovery program from Mormonism.

Being gay is one of the cardinal sins in the Mormon faith, and I looked at RJ contacting Chris to see about renewing their relationship as a door to Chris leaving the church, once and for all. Hooray. Redemption.

Unfortunately, in these situations, there have to be victims, atleast in the movie version.  Rj's great boyfriend in Seattle, and Chris's beautiful wife in Salt Lake --I feel really badly for both of them. However, I can't imagine given how great spirited both of them are, that they would not find much better partners for themselves at a later period in life.

I agree with one of the contributors here on Amazon that gave this movie two stars ,and said that the leads in the film needed ""therapy and meds"". Don't know with these two, however, if even that would help. The whole thing just left a bad taste, and made me want to close to door faster when two poor guileless mormon boys come to my door, attempting to get me to join up.",1528588800,,1448,4.432330827067669
8613305,2,B00F98FOPE,"Wow - after reading all of those dreamy 5-star reviews, it is clear why most marriages end in divorce and why gay male relationships are so difficult. The first 40 minutes of this film were really great. Things went over a cliff, however, when RJ flies to Salt Lake City and shows up on the doorsteps of his married ex-boyfriend's home. Clearly unwelcomed, he gets himself invited to dinner and becomes an overnight guest. Then he meets up with this married man, gives him his number, and restarts an ""affair"" that ended 5 years in the past - when they were 20yo. I left out the part about him leaving a good-looking well-adjusted man who is out of the closet and in love with him -- and who had just met his parents days earlier. So, yeah, I don't have much empathy for RJ. I actually felt sorry for Chris. The closet is awful; being in a fake marriage is awful; but who needs a stalking ex lover to ""rescue"" you from your bad choices? No one. And when RJ shows up at the anniversary party and makes it all about him  -- that was just too much to bear. I ended up hating ALL of these pathetic characters.

8613308,4,B00F98FOPE,"My least favorite of the Falls trilogy, due to plot holes. Still a very good film. Spoilers here.

After seeing the first film, I was very invested in RJ and Chris. I am neither gay nor Mormon, just a hopeless romantic, but I really hoped true love would prevail for the star-crossed lovers. I was sold on their romance- it seemed so real.

It is 5 years later, and much has changed. Chris is married to a woman, and RJ is out of the closet, with a steady boyfriend, Paul, but still Mormon-ish. He vacillates between pride and shame. Ferrucci does an excellent job portraying the religious conflict in a subtle way, and his one-sided relationship with Paul.

There is some interesting symbolism woven into the plot. Chris is now a pharmaceutical sales rep, and doing fabulously well, judging by his mansion. Yet pharmaceutical sales in recent years has become notorious for unethical business practices, to say the least. Chris is both selling a lie, and living a heterosexual lie with his wife, played by Hannah Barefoot, a perfect Mormon/Stepford wife. All is not what it seems.

When Rodney, the Iraq veteran, dies the funeral becomes an excuse for Chris to see RJ again. Why else would Chris attend, when he hadn't kept in touch with Rodney for 5 years? Chris is now very conflicted, as he has been through ""reparative therapy"", and is married to a woman. He rebuffs RJ, who returns home with a lot on his mind. RJ realizes he has never gotten over Chris, and he comes clean with Paul, breaking off their relationship.

Shortly thereafter, RJ impulsively shows up uninvited at Chris' front door. Considering that Chris did not respond to his months of calls and letters years ago, and now is married, would RJ really do that? This film is not as fresh and natural as the first.

RJ confronts Chris about being in a fake straight marriage. He is still seeking closure for Chris dropping out of his life after their mission. Chris remains in denial, but after seeing RJ, he cannot function sexually with his wife.

Chris calls RJ. There is a night of passion, and Chris' wife catches them in the act. He then comes out to his immediate family, inviting RJ to be present, which didn't seem very believable. Later, RJ crashes an anniversary party, and plants a passionate kiss, while dozens of aghast friends and family members look on. A little stalker-ish.

There were some excellent performances from RJ's lover, Paul, and Chris' wife, Emily. Both spurned partners really make us feel their pain and confusion..

Despite the weak spots, and occasional stilted dialogue, the chemistry between the two leads is good enough that I'd watch them mow the lawn! Once again, Ferrucci and Farmer shine in their portrayal of two men who long to be together, but are kept apart by their conservative religion.
