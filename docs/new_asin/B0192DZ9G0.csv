8743555,5,B0192DZ9G0,"As ever, Aparna delivers on her promise. The ""Winter Vinyasa"" sequences definitely help generate some inner fire to ameliorate the winter chill and blues. My favorite is the second sequence (experienced Beginner/Intermediate); I can feel my body warming quickly, my head clearing, and it stays with me throughout my day. I enjoy Level 1 for a slightly gentler practice, too. If you've had the pleasure of practicing with Aparna, or at least practicing with one of her previous DVDs, then you know how conscientious she is about her asana cues. She has been my teacher for years, and I am still amazed by just how perfectly cued the sequences are in this DVD. She knows the right moment to explain, or to be silent, to be encouraging, or maybe weave in humor. She is a true gem, and I feel grateful to have this DVD as part of my home practice options. The bonus materials (just email her to request them after purchasing the DVD) related to Ayurveda and Chinese medicine--including healthy habits for thriving in winter, plus ingredients to use for winter cooking==are incredibly beneficial. She addresses the reality of living in this world  while providing tips on how to make it a little simpler and more peaceful (e.g., the strong desire to hibernate during these cold months, but the necessity to still be productive and how to help yourself through this conflict). Enjoy this DVD for all the wholesomeness it offers.",1452902400,,1422,4.851851851851852
8743556,5,B0192DZ9G0,Really great for your home yoga practice! I notice that my body feels so much healthier after doing this sequence with Aparna this winter! I like that there is a beginner option and an intermediate option and the lifestyle tips have been really useful and easy to apply!,1452816000,,270,4.645833333333333
8743557,5,B0192DZ9G0,"This is a wonderful Vinyasa yoga DVD!  I love that there are two different sequence levels so I can choose the level that would be most assessible for me on any given day.  The flow sequence is creative, intelligent, and completely adaptible for a beginner to even slightly advanced range.  Her yoga instruction includes modifications and is clear enough that I can listen and focus on the flow without having to look at the DVD.  I am very picky about verbal presentation and voice tone and Aparna has the most lovely and pleasant voice for yoga.  You will get a wonderful yoga experience each time you practice with this DVD.  Highly recommend it!

8743558,5,B0192DZ9G0,"Winter Vinyasa with Aparna brings together all the beautiful elements of a class with this suburb teacher. The serenity of her voice guides you through the a well planned practice in front of a cozy fire place. Some how by the end you are not only more relaxed, but are also more energized. She gives you two hour vinyas plus a relaxation section. Aparna's talented instruction graciously unites the physical elements of yoga with the spiritual aspects of movement with intention. The experience it sublime.  I certainly look forward to using this DVD in my home practice this winter.",1450569600,,584,4.898989898989899
8743559,5,B0192DZ9G0,"This is another great offering from Aparna, who embodies the philosophy that yoga is adaptable to everyone's needs and the natural rhythms of nature and one's own life. I have done both the Level I and Level II practices multiple times and as always, the sequencing and cueing are superb. She offers variations that make both accessible to all who have a basic understanding of yoga basics and attunement to their body's needs. I will do these series throughout the year whenever I need some ""fire"", but of course this is especially beneficial in this winter season. I believe this DVD will find a wide and enthusiastic audience among those who pursue a deeper yoga practice.",1449705600,,675,4.827586206896552
