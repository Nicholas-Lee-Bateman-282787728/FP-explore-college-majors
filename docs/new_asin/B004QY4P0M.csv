8557516,5,B004QY4P0M,"I saw Roy in concert only once, about 12 years ago, and this performance has a lot in common with the best elements of that show -- the intimacy (the audience is small enough that every one of them is named in the credits), flawless technique, and rich emotion. About the only thing missing from a classic Roy Harper show is any direct interaction with the audience; when he was performing regularly, almost invariably someone from the audience would shout something at him, he'd shout back, and the whole place would rock with laughter. Here, Roy manages some of his trademark humor and poignant observations, but it all seems a little TOO respectful toward him -- Roy deserves an admiring pedestal more than most artists, in my opinion, but actually putting him on one detracts from the experience.

Musically, this is a fantastic show. In songs like ""Commune"" and ""The Green Man,"" the close-ups on his hands show off his ability to play rhythm and ""lead"" simultaneously. He's in good voice as well, although you'll hear a slight quaver at times, but far less than you'd expect from a 70-year-old with a history of lung ailments. The highlight for me is ""Me And My Woman,"" which is always a ferociously intense epic of a song, and the version here just might be the best ever recorded. He follows it with the final number, ""Cricketer,"" which is just as lovely as ever, and it's almost too poignant that he ends this post-semi-retirement concert with a paean to nostalgia.

My only real quibble with the production is that the vocals are a bit too loud in relation to the guitar. They needed to be closer to parity for this to be a perfect recording, and sometimes the guitar is all but drowned out.

Finally, we're also treated to a post-concert interview, which we only hear from Roy's end (no interviewer is seen or heard from). Some great typically rambling Roy perspectives on life, the universe, and everything are over far too soon. He even critiques his own performance, and his perspective seemed the opposite of mine: in his view, the first half of the show was better, while I thought the second half was where his full shine came through.",1312761600,,2151,4.685185185185185
8557517,5,B004QY4P0M,"If you are a Roy Harper fan I will not waste my time or yours trying to quantify Roy or his music. This is a record of a fantastic performance in front of a small invited audience. The audio and visual reproduction is excellent. You may have noticed that some of his work is becoming increasingly rare, so do yourself a favour and buy this DVD while you can.",1310774400,,358,4.202898550724638
