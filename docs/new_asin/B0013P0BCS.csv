8252504,1,B0013P0BCS,I received this as a gift from a friend and the same thing happened... DVDr. Plays in my computer but not on my BD players. Bummer... and I don't have the the heart to tell my friend.,1335830400,,183,3.972972972972973
8252505,1,B0013P0BCS,"Very disappointing - poorly packaged item was clearly a DVD-R (you know, the ones with the purple tint that you can burn at home) and *surprise*, it won't play in my DVD Player (brand new Sony). Yes, I can get it to play in my PC but this isn't the kind of thing I want to watch in the family room. So without commenting on the content, don't buy this DVD - it has zero value if you can't play it.",1335398400,,397,3.9135802469135803
