8457339,4,B005535JIA,I am so pleased that I can see old episodes of B&B.  This is a must have for fans.  I also recommend the other DVD Catfights and Brawls.  The strongest episodes are the courtroom scene with Taylor blaming Brooke and the aftermath of Brooke's rape.  The episodes on the best of Ridge segment was not that strong. It's too bad there wasn't a section with the best of Brooke and Taylor. This DVD can be played on a region 1 player.,1428278400,2,428,4.246913580246914
