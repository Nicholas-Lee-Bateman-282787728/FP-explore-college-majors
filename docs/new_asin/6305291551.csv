7887527,5,6305291551,"Only Gene Autry could get away with some of the departures from conventional B-Western orthodoxy that his pre-World War II films featured, and this is one of the most unconventional.

Gene and Smiley Burnette, flat-broke rodeo cowboys, start a cross country road trip from New York to California in car and horse trailer, unaware that a young English boy has ""stowed away"" with them, thinking they're the ""employees"" of his father who are supposed to take him to his father's ""Rancho San Quentin."" The father has actually been framed by corrupt business partners and is serving time in the prison of the same name. The ""employees"" are henchmen of the men who framed the father, and they are trying to kidnap the boy to keep the father from spilling the beans about their nefarious activities.

Along the way, the three encounter June Storey and Mary Lee, sisters who have fled Storey's impending wedding to a man whom she didn't want to marry. They've stolen his car to make their getaway, adding another element to the cocktail of the plot.

The two thugs encounter Autry and Burnette and try to take the boy with them, sparking a slam-bang fistfight which ends with the crooks fleeing in their car, without the young Englishman. Later, when the cowboys, the youth and the sisters are stopped by a motorcycle cop, Storey reveals her talent for comic dialogue by convincing him that Gene is her husband (she gets a firm grip on the side of Gene's neckerchief away from the cop to ensure that the Singing Cowboy will say what she wants him to).

The boy's father, having learned of his son's being in danger, and then escaping from prison, finally encounters the boy and the others at the ranch of a second suitor of Storey's, who is reluctant to marry her because he has a chance to make western movies. The denouement comes after the father has agreed to go back to prison until he can testify against the men who framed him, and the bad guys board the train he's on in a last-ditch attempt to silence him. Watch for Gene's transfer from Champion's back to the speeding train; he actually did the stunt himself. Unusual that the director would allow his star to do such a dangerous transfer, but it's obvious that it is Gene (who liked doing his own stunts, when allowed to, according to interviews with people who worked with him).

When reading a synopsis of the plot like this, it may sound like a mishmash, but actually it works well, and has a number of funny lines, and especially comic acting from June Storey, who was not known for her talent at that. The music is good, too, including the title song, performed by Gene and company when they are trying to win a talent contest to earn some money to continue their trip.

This is a movie from the year of the height of Gene's popularity (1940). It shows once again why he zoomed to the top: He was pleasant, genial, a warm, sincere singer, could do his own stunts well when permitted, and had a multi-talented, unique comic foil at his side in Smiley Burnette. And Republic Pictures and Autry weren't afraid to blaze new trails in defining what a ""B-Western"" was all about.",1329609600,,3131,4.6122082585278275

Special footnote, Orvon Gene Autry was an American performer who gained fame as The Singing Cowboy on the radio, in movies and on television --- Discovered by film producer Nat Levine in 1934, he and Burnette made their film debut for Mascot Pictures Corp. ""In Old Santa Fe"" as part of a singing cowboy quartet; he was then given the starring role by Levine in 1935 in the 12-part serial ""The Phantom Empire"" --- Shortly thereafter, Mascot was absorbed by the formation of Republic Pictures Corp. and Autry went along to make a further 44 films up to 1940, all B westerns in which he played under his own name, rode his horse Champion, had Burnette as his regular sidekick and had many opportunities to sing in each film --- Autry became the top Western star at the box-office by 1937, reaching his national peak of popularity from 1940 to 1942. His Gene Autry Flying ""A"" Ranch Rodeo show debuted in 1940 --- Gene Autry is the only celebrity to have five stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, one in each of the five categories maintained by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce --- Radio, Films, Recordings, Television and Live Theater.

2. Smiley Burnette (aka: Lester Alvin Burnette)
Date of Birth: 18 March 1911 - Summum, Illinois
Date of Death: 16 February 1967 - Encino, California

Second special footnote, Lester Alvin (Smiley) Burnette an American singer-songwriter who could play as many as 100 different musical instruments, was a successful comedy actor in Western films over three decades --- The popularity of Burnette's Frog Millhouse character, with his trademark floppy black hat, was such that when Autry left for World War II service he did sidekicks duties with Eddie Dew, Sunset Carson and Bob Livingston, plus nine other films with Roy Rogers. After leaving Republic Pictures in 1944, Burnette became the sidekick to Charles Starrett at Columbia Pictures in the long Durango Kid series. Starrett starred in the series from 1944 until 1952, and that pairing resulted in more than 50 films. After the Starrett series was over, Burnette joined Autry for his final six films, all released by Columbia Pictures in 1953.

7887529,3,6305291551,"Videohound, which I usually trust, gives Gene Autry's movies low ratings. I'm sorry if they're not ""sophisticated"" enough for them. They're missing out. Gene and Smiley transport a British kid to his felon father. Along the way they run into cuties June Storey and Mary Lee. June Storey is beautiful as always and plays one feisty character. This was the first movie I've ever seen Mary in and I was captivated by her. She has such a beautiful voice. The only bad element in this flick was the kid actor. He got on my nerves quick. The song which Smiley and Gene share is so catchy. I played it three times.",1072224000,,607,4.4774774774774775
7887530,5,6305291551,"Gaucho Serenade is one of the sometime typically unusual Autry westerns by the fact that when you see Autry for the first time he is riding in a car pulling a horse trail. This one is comedy at it's best with Smiley Burnette, Mary Lee and June Storey as his sidekicks.  From cars running into rivers, to catching a speeding locamotive with his trusty horse Champion.  For those who have never seen this movie be aware that Autry did do most of his own stunt work and fight scenes.  It really is Autry climbing on board this locamotive with Champion fearlessly running beside him.  If you purchase this movie you will see American Favorite Cowboy and Hero help a small boy find his father, clear his father who was framed and take down a crooked cattle buyers conglomerate and then as usual gets the girl in the process.  This is a FIVE star movie.  Buy It!",980467200,4,856,4.455128205128205
