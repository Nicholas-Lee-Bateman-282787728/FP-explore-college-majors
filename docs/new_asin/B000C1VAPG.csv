8095093,3,B000C1VAPG,"So silly its entertaining (but not campy)! Just look at the cover, if anyone takes this with any caliber of seriousness they should be shot by this movie's villain! Check your brain in at the door if you are going to let this Baron soar!",1423526400,,237,4.288888888888889
8095094,4,B000C1VAPG,"good movie for slightly older kids and funny for adults also, really hard to find this any where else on the web",1389830400,,112,4.136363636363637
8095095,5,B000C1VAPG,"Saw this movie on TV in the mid 1990's  and never found it on TV again or on any movie websites. I just had to have it on DVD. It appears to have been made as more the horror film genre, but the humor and silliness smoothed over any scariness. My 13 year old son last week had as many laughs as I did while watching it together. Mickey Rooney was great, but the lines said by the ""Red Baron"" throughout the film made our day and should have won the Oscar..... kidding of course, but I recommend this movie for anyone who is interested an ""off the wall"" semi horror/ comedy film. There are lots of bullets flying, yelling, screaming and some intense moments in this movie and recommend leaving it to the discretion among any adult viewers to decide what age for others in the household to safely view and enjoy.",1359676800,,810,4.294117647058823
8095096,1,B000C1VAPG,"Well this is one of the all time worst films that have to deal with the Bloody Baron himself.
It took 5 tries to watch this film thou.",1242950400,,134,3.8214285714285716
8095097,5,B000C1VAPG,"This Movie is funny as hell,I watch it all the time. Almost all my friends love it. my mom even likes it. So that tells you something right there. Some have even asked me where to get a copy. One of my brothers watched it and liked it everybody I showed it to liked it, which was several people. anyway watch it. It is Definitely worth it. They should really make a sequel to this. This was a Great sequel to Von Richthofen and Brown, an Indirect sequel of course. also another great thing is that Revenge Of The Red Baron is pretty much a spinoff of puppet master which is really awesome, a great spinoff at that.",1172620800,4,614,4.211864406779661
8095098,5,B000C1VAPG,"I happen to like horror movies, so I found this quite entertainnng, and intriguing, has it own twists and turns.",1155427200,4,112,4.65
8095099,1,B000C1VAPG,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen.  My mother-in-law gave it to my son who likes WWI aircraft.  We didn't know it was going to be a horror movie -- scared the kids.  I was going to insist we stop 30 minutes into the movie, but my daughter wanted to see how the thing turned out.  I decided to let us finish the movie to use it as an object lesson in discernment and to teach that one need not finish a movie that is such a waste of time.  Both kids (ages 7 and 10) agreed it was awful, and we destroyed it lest anyone else be unwittingly subjected to it.",1146528000,2,561,3.8859649122807016
8095100,1,B000C1VAPG,"This movie is an embarrassment. Mickey Rooney must be in desperate need of money to have appeared in a film like this. Executive producer Roger Corman proves once again that he has no understanding of what the Red Baron stands  for. (His first misinterpretation was his 1971 flick, ""Von Richthofen  and Brown."") No one who knows anything about the Red Baron could  accept a movie in which he kills a young boy's father at home as well as a  nurse in a hospital. This movie could have been a spoof of films like the  ""Chucky"" movies but it just is not funny. I read in a newspaper  that Corman could not find anyone who was willing to distribute this film  to movie theaters so that tells you something about its quality.",930009600,13,720,4.450381679389313
