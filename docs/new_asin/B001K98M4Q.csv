3663633,5,B001K98M4Q,"I remember this cartoon series when it first came out in the 90's. I didn't have cable, since it came out in Cartoon Network, but whenever I would visit my relatives i would try to catch the show. I loved the series back then and still love the series today. It's a great series filled with lots of action and a solid story line.",1238371200,,329,4.15625
3663634,5,B001K98M4Q,"The perfect ending for a great and classic show! As always, there's no limit to the fighting and funny comments and expressions of each character.

3663635,5,B001K98M4Q,"I was sad to hear that they were canceling one of the greatest anime tv shows ever in my opinion. It's well worth it to buy this box set and hopefully Yu Yu Hakusho will be continued one day.

3663636,4,B001K98M4Q,"The climactic battles of ""Yu Yu Hakusho"" are finally here, and Yusuke's team has only mere minutes to prevent a demon invasion into our world.

In fact, the penultimate arc of the supernatural adventure series punches all the buttons to keep itself from getting boring -- tragedy, surprise, action and some truly unexpected transformations. The rest of ""Yu Yu Hakusho: Season Four"" is a bit less interesting, but it's an action-packed and suitable way of finishing off the classic series.

Yusuke and former Spirit Detective Sensui start duking it out, but Yusuke quickly learns that he hasn't got a chance against Sensui's attacks. But he keeps fighting and prevents Koenma from interfering with him, even as Kurama, Hiei and Kuwabara are unable to help him. And in a matter of seconds, Yusuke Urameshi is brutally killed by Sensui.

Enraged and grief-stricken, his three friends' power rises up more fearsomely than before, and they attack Sensui despite not having enough power to beat him. And a group of soldiers appear from Spirit World with a shocking revelation about Yusuke Urameshi -- just in time for the former delinquent and Spirit Detective to undergo a bizarre transformation. With new power (and a new Puu), Yusuke decides to settle the score with his predecessor!

Afterwards, Yusuke is dealing with the revelations about himself when he learns of a war in the Demon Realm -- and the identity of one of the three demon kings there. As he deals with his own problems, Hiei and Kurama are forced to deal with the horrible consequences of their pasts -- and all three boys become tightly wound in a power struggle for the ultimate power over the Demon Realm.

""Yu Yu Hakusho's"" fourth season is a solid one -- although after the seamless, harrowing finale of the whole Black Chapter arc, it's a bit of a letdown when the demon lads get involved in months-long politics. Still, the entire fourth season does a great job wrapping up the various plot threads -- including character arcs, such as Kurama's division between his human and fox sides.

But before that ending, there's a lot of slam-bang action -- Yusuke's unexpected physical transformation, a savage duel, and a rage-fueled attack on Sensui by Yusuke's three friends. But there are plenty of quieter moments woven in (Itsuki's thoughts on Sensui) as well as some truly insane comedy (we finally discover why Koenma has been using that pacifier throughout the whole series).

After the harrowing penultimate arc, it feels a bit anticlimactic to have a tournament and lots of political strife. But they manage to make it stay interesting with lots of top-notch fights (especially Kurama's) and the relationships between the cast and their demon friends/relatives -- both old and new.

Yusuke becomes more mature and more powerful here -- and aware of how threatening his newfound power is. Kuwabara is absent for much of the fourth season, butwe get to see how close he and Yusuke have become. But Kurama and Hiei get the most attention: Kurama faces his past as a ruthless bandit and his split personality, while Hiei has to face his cruel past. And our favorite three-eyed demon becomes close to a woman with a past even more ghastly than his -- which is saying something. Remember when he wouldn't have ANY friends?

And it ends on a mellow note, winding down the various character arcs and revealing how the characters are doing, wherever they are. A few of these are actually a bit surprising, but it all fits nicely.

The fourth season of ""Yu Yu Hausho"" is an all-around solid ending to a much-beloved series, with loads of brutal action and surprising revelations.",1227484800,5,3643,4.889789303079416

3663654,5,B001K98M4Q,"This season could be written off as a re-hash of the previous three.  It contains most of the elements of all the other stories up to now.  It does provide the greatest sense of resolution.  The story does not feel like it has no real end and the writers are not trying to stretch material thin by this point.

I rarely read and watch the same manga, so I do not now how true the story stayed to the original material through the seasons.  This season definitely delivers on all the elements that I enjoyed previously.  It closes well without betraying its original feel or the characters up to this point.  The humor becomes much more varied and the fights progress with the characters.  It has far less schoolyard antics and greater depth despite the lack of some greater mission to save some biosphere.  The fights seem closer to the end of Samurai Champloo than Gohan vs Cell.",1488326400,,880,4.518987341772152

3663681,5,B001K98M4Q,"The final season of Yu Yu Hakusho! here is my review for Yu Yu Hakusho season 4, please enjoy!

Plot and Characters: (minor spoilers) During the final battle with Sensui Yusuke gets possessed by a demon in mid battle. After the battle is ended Koenma jr finds out that a long time ago relative of Yusuke's is a demon, unearthing more it is found that Yusuke's ancestory is one of the three demons kings who is having a three way power stuggle to rule all of demon world. With knowing that Koenma is forced to fire Yusuke as spirit detective. Now with no job Yusuke goes to meet his ancester and find out why he possessed him at the time. Mean while the other two demon kings summon Hiei and Kurama to aid them at their side. In this story arc the three kings are Rizen, Yusuke's ancestor and is considered to be the strongest of the 3 demon kings but has taken a hunger strike so he is weaken to their level. Then there is Yomi the blind demon who was once a servant to Kurama in the past but since Kurama suffered an injury he took over as the strongest of the two since then. Last there is Mukuro who is the king who hides behind the mask of bandages. Mukuro enlist Hiei in their army because Murkuo knows how ruthless Hiei is. Now the biggest power struggle of the most powerful demons to ever exist come into play. Who will wil?

Pros: The action is pretty good still. Story line is great. This dvd set is 100% UNCUT and UNCENSORED so you get all the action, blood, swearing and violence there should be.

Cons: Other than the dvd holding case being a bit flimsy I don't have many problems with the physical part.

Story episode cons: Once again its the episodes and how it was packed by funimation is what I got a problem with. The 1st disc part of the second discs is still showing the end of the Chapter Black story arc so season 4 really starts on Season 4, Disc 2 episode 3. So techanlly in story line form the 3 Kings Story arc is only 18 episodes, Chapter Black story arc is 27 episodes long, The Dark Tournament story arc is 40 episodes long, and the Spirit Detective story is 25 episodes long. So the 3 Kings arc gets the short end of the episode stick, If you get past this then its all good, I just thought I would give you a heads up.

Over All: I liked how it ended, It was good ending to a final season. I kinda wish it didn't end. I hope you enjoy it if you watch this series, so BUY IT!",1454803200,,2406,4.15450643776824

 Yu Yu Hakusho Season 4 contains the final episodes of the series, 85 - 112. This season concludes The Chapter Black Saga ending with a cliff hanger that leads into the final story arc, The Three Kings Saga. I consider the former to be the best of the series, simply because it's written the best; very good plot, sub-plots, and villains that could actually be taken seriously, and many of them didn't feel like throw away characters, which is something that usually can't be avoided with series like these. The writing was far stronger here than in the previous story arc The Dark Tournament. The aforementioned arc had moments where the story overshadowed the action, where as here, there was more of an even balance. The action had many good moments, while many other aspects were just as well developed.

 The season began with Yusuke being hopelessly outmatched with Sensui in their battle. The fight was written pretty well since it never truly felt one-sided. It did have its moments where it began to drag, eventually it picked up and revealed another side or ""sides"" to Sensui. The battle opened up another story focusing on Yusuke that would be explored in the Three Kings Saga.

 The following story arc takes place in the Demon World involving three rulers locked in a stalemated civil war. One of the rulers is on the brink of death, and his actions along with the other two forces Yusuke, Kurama, and Hiei to intervene. This sees the three friends all on opposing sides where there can only be one winner. Later, a new Dark Tournament is formed and familiar faces will be set to do battle against new, more powerful ones.

 I use to feel that Yu Yu Hakusho was one season too long and it should have ended awhile ago. However, The Three Kings Saga grew on me after the recent rewatch. It no longer feels as tacked on as before and it accomplishes something many shows of its type doesn't, and that's provide closure wrapping up all major story threads. Now that I think about it, even the smaller ones were taken care of in some fashion. Nothing annoys me more than sitting through something and nothing is tied up. I do wish there were some things wrapped up a lot better, but I won't complain about it.

 The characters are a bit stronger this time around, but it's actually the second tier main characters, fan favorites Kurama and Hiei who clearly overshadow Yusuke. They actually receive their own episodes which explores their origins in good detail. I enjoyed these episodes the most, and I didn't miss Yusuke or Kuwabara at all. Yusuke never really seems to break his hard-headed mold, and he falls very close to the realm of being a static character, and sometimes an annoying one, but he does have good qualities to him; such as not caring if demons have to eat humans which I thought was funny. He's just a character who I can be 50/50 with all depending on the occasion I guess. If I have any problems with this season at all, then it would be the usual dragging moments, along with the final arc being very predictable towards the end.

 The animation is on par with the third season which is a good thing. Some of the fights are pretty entertaining with decent animation to very good. The character designs have some really good moments with creative looking demons, such as the six-earred Yomi and the near mummified looking Mukuro. The BGM went through a little change by adding in at least one new catchy battle theme.

 Yu Yu Hakusho overall could have been much better had it taken some serious risk. I would like to give some examples, unfortunately if I did, then spoilers would be unavoidable. It's a good thing it ended at this point too, because it could have easily gone the cash cow route and started rehashing stories. This is what basically killed DBZ and other shows of its type, they just didn't know when to end.

 In closing, YYH is not an anime that is going to appeal to the more thought provoking crowd. If Perfect Blue, Noir, Neo Tokyo, and Battle Angel are the only type of anime that appeals to you, then avoid this title. However, if Dragon Ball Z, Bleach, and D. Gray-Man are your thing, then you'll more than likely love this.

Pros: Very good story, action and animation. Has an ending.

Cons: Somewhat predictable, final arc not as strong as others",1413590400,,4556,4.62453531598513

The 1st disk is actually the end of season 3 where yusuke concludes his battle with Sensui. The following disks follow yusuke's mission to be demon king and shows Yusuke, Hiei, and Kurama training under the 3 demon kings leading up to a tournament after Raizen dies.

After watching the four main characters grow up for the past 100+ episodes, it's hard to believe it really ends as *spoiler spoilers his spoiler at the spoiler.
If you have seen any amount of Yu Yu Hakusho, you need to watch the entire series. If you haven't seen Yu Yu Hakusho, I suggest you view it. Not only is it a classic, but it still holds up to the  anime of this decade. While the animation is not as wonderful as say Fullmetal Alchemist, it is still incredibly well done. The four main characters, while based of archetypes, truly grow as the show continues. Yusuke finds out his past and learns how to face his future, Kuwabara finds new meaning in his life, Kurama finds a way to balance Shuichi and Yoko, and Hiei comes to term with his own past and the effects of it.

And I have to say that the series was ended splendidly especially since the animation stepped up a notch in season 3. It's such a feel good ending and I have no regrets with this purchase as well as the purchase of the previous 3 seasons.

3663814,2,B001K98M4Q,I have been buying on here for a long time and have been very sastified with everything i have gotten. I will admit that I have never left a review but that's because I stay real busy and I'm sorry that my first review is a bad one. This item and the one that came with it arrived two days late and on top of that this item in particular Yu Yu Hakusho: Season 4's case has two broken pieces inside and one of those pieces held the extra disc tray in place so when i opened it two of the discs were just sliding around inside and that upset me because I collect blu rays and take very good care of my movies and do not like for my cases or movies to be damaged in anyway.,1328486400,,670,3.86231884057971

Well after searching and watching anime series after series for nearly 15 years, i finally found a series that just captures me from start to finish despite only being 112 episodes long. Anime fans, this anime series will capture your mind. Yu Yu Hakusho is the epitome and the quintessential of a great and awesome anime. Anime fans, enjoy this series. Chapter Black Saga is my personal favorite.",1323993600,2,466,4.8375
3663817,5,B001K98M4Q,"This is the best anime personally ever, solid, 11/10. I just think its gonna be hard to find a series as entertaining with as much action and comedy. This is quite possibly one of the most un comparable series of anime out there. The cast is awesome, i loved every character. This series, IT shouldn't be over! Dragonball z/kai/gt made different versions. Please bring back this series! I was very sad to see the last episode, only wish they would make more. Got to go collect the Dragon balls and wish for it to happen. I will sincerely miss watching new episodes of this, but i already have the OVA series on the way DECEMBER 12, is the release day. GET YOUR COPY AND SUPPORT THIS AMAZING ANIME, bring back the genres we liked! Avid fan, Justin Cook did a awesome job!!! Your team is awesome in every way! this show is the Everest of my anime world, Its gonna be a trek from the peak this series left me at, my expectations have launched into space as NASA has been grounded. Out Standing! Phuu!! I'll miss this series the most out of any Ive ever seen before. I thoroughly enjoyed every second of this series from beginning to end.",1322870400,18,1134,4.404761904761905
3663828,3,B001K98M4Q,"I'm not going to say any more about this series, because everything has already been said. This is one of my favorite animes of all time and I have watched all seasons on DVD, and have now purchased the entire Blu-ray collection to add to my ""personal collection.""

*IMPORTANT TO KNOW*
I'm reviewing this after having viewed the DVD version, and having just bought a 46"" Samsung LED TV.

I must say....that I'm rather disappointed in this blu-ray ""remastering.""

The Positive:
-The iconic, classic soundtrack sounds AMAZING
-The colors have been restored and are FANTASTIC
-4:3 ratio has been kept, so you see the anime as it was CREATED
-Very crisp, clean detail in image

The Negative (and in my eyes, a HUGE negative)
-This is not really a frame-by-frame ""back to analog"" remastering (or in my eyes is not). What bugs me the most (maybe because I expected it) is that there is a TON of dirt on the analog that they didn't clean. Therefore, you are PLAGUED by glittering white spots, and even occasional tears or hair. This also gets WORSE throughout the series, particularly during the Dark Tournament! The colors are great, so ""Black shadows"" are truly black, but there is so much dirt that they left behind that the blackness shimmers with white specks!

Now please, don't get me wrong. This is a great series that is being sold at a great price and, in my mind, is worth buying. However, TRUST ME in saying that this isn't a true remastering such as seen by Disney (such as the Lion King) or the brilliant remasterings of the James Bond films. I UNDERSTAND that it would take forever to digitally remove all the dirt, but they could have AT LEAST gone back to the analog, cleaned it, then ran it through the converter.

I must give this product a 3 out of 5. In all honesty, I give it a 1 out of 5 for the ""Remastering,"" but I give this series, plus the appealing price, plus the great color and sound a 5 out of 5. I recommend this series, but if you are like me, you will be annoyed by all the ""dirt"" on the footage.

(BTW, these dirt spots are apparent throughout the DVD version. The quality is much better on the Blu-ray overall, but the dirt was not removed)

I hope this review helps. I feel like all the ""most helpful reviews"" on this product are very poor reviews or are too biased to mention this.

3663829,1,B001K98M4Q,"i ordered this product hoping to complete a full set of the show.  after it took it until the late afternoon of the final day of the $11 shipping fee to get here i finally get it and open and start looking at it and rather than having discs 1, 2, 3, and 4 it just had 2 copies of discs 1 and 2.  i go onto amazon.com to tell them about the mix up and when i get someone to talk to im told that although i ordered it through their site it was actually through one of their subsidiaries so they couldn't replace my product.  i then had to mail the product back and although they did email me a label to mail it with i then had to wait 2 weeks longer for them to put my money back on my card.  this is by far the worst expiriance i have ever had ordering something online i will probably never use amazon.com again.",1313625600,,812,3.8734939759036147

First off this is one of my favorite anime series and the box-sets are worth the investment, but the reason why I gave this box-set 3 stars is the fact that the third and fourth disc don't work on an Xbox 360. It's not just the one I have, because I've ordered this before more than once and it just wouldn't play right. The episodes would repeat or skip no matter what I did.",1306800000,,444,4.056818181818182
