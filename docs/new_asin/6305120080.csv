971388,5,6305120080,"This is an excellent documentary.  It is narrated by Sarah Jessica Parker and Leonard Nimoy.  There is a great deal of footage of several Hasidic groups in Brooklyn, many interesting interviews (of course), and some footage filmed in Eastern Europe.  Although the point of view of the film is from the outside looking in, there is a definite affection for the subject matter on the part of the filmmakers.  The film includes some dissenting voices as balance (a neighborhood person who finds the hasidim rude, a former hasidic woman who has left the community to become a professional academic).  The tape also includes a PBS interview with the two filmmakers.  Highly recommended as cultural documentary and as a film about the Hasidim.",977616000,8,737,5.0
971389,5,6305120080,"I saw this on PBS and it deserves the rave reviews it got in educational circles.  It's 90 minutes long and it covers Hasidic history (good archive material on Lubovitch!), home life, customs, etc.  There's some footage of the Bobover Rebbe and his followers -- that's a group I barely knew about before.  Also lots of material on Lubovitch.  Most of the footage is of families, schools, and synagogues and was shot in Brooklyn, NY.  There's a few scenes in Russia and Ukraine (where a lot of Hasidim originally came from), but none from Israel. (Well, after all, the title does say it is about Hasidism in AMERICA.)  In addition to the interviews with Hasidim, there are opinions of scholars, and some non-Hasidic neighbors who are angry that the Hasidim won't talk to them on the streets.  (I didn't understand that attitude at all -- I mean, the streets are dangerous places. I don't talk to strangers either, and I'm not Hasidic.  There's no rule that says you have to talk to people just because they live on your street.  A lot of the Hasidim didn't want to be filmed for this movie, either -- and that's their right.)  Anyway, I learned a lot.  Good film!",972518400,13,1162,4.592233009708738
971390,5,6305120080,"This documentary is currently my #1 recommendation to students, teachers, and others who want a good visual presentation of Hasidic culture. I highly recommend it in my well-used Hasidism FAQ, and it is the #1 best-selling educational video on my website. Whether you are teaching a unit on ""The Chosen"" in some remote area where there are no Hasidism, or living in New York City where you see Hasidim every day on the streets and have always wondered about them, this video is for you. It's an excelent multi-cultural tool and, because of its PBS documentary style, it can be used in public schools without violating the separation of church (synagogue, actually...) and state.

My one complaint is that the producers fell for the ubiquitous ""obligatory"" politically-correct need to include a dissatified woman (poet Pearl Gluck) who left the Hasidic community.  I realize that PBS wants to be objective, but why not balance this with a story about a ""modern"" woman who left that world to become Hasidic (of which there are MANY!!!)

I also felt that the segment about the black guy who was offended when he asked about a Jewish holy day and was told ""we are praying for you, too"" was not well explained.  The black guy thought the Jew was being paternalistic toward blacks by praying for ""the poor black guy"" (his assumption)  but that was not it at all. Since the Jewish group was gathered around the water saying prayers, I assume it was Rosh Hashanah (Jewish New Year) and they were doing the tashlich service.  The THEME of Rosh Hashanah includes prayers for the whole world --it has nothing to do with race.  It would have been nice if ths had been explained somehow.

Still, this is the best documentary on Hasidism currently available on video and, in spite of these flaws, it is well worth buying as an educational resource. (I currently recommend it on my Hasidism FAQ site).  The video also has an interesting trailer interview with the producers, who discuss various reactions to the film, how and why it was made, etc.",953251200,64,2032,4.766381766381766

971457,3,6305120080,"1) The key aspect of an Orthodox Jewish male's life is Talmudic Scholarship. An ideal day (nearly the entire day) is spent learning complex legal concepts, terms and cases on a spiritual level that cannot be put into words (often involving property rights, laws of holidays, damages, lending and selling etc). The film only made one reference to this though when a young orthodox man said (being that he didn't know anything about women anyway) he was looking to marry a woman with money in order that he could sit and learn all day. This brings me to my next point.

2) The film referenced the Gra (Vilna Gaon) who tried to stop the Chassidic movement from spreading. What the film didn't mention was the fact that the Gra was successful. The Chassidim today learn as often as possible and more closely resemble the Gra's misnagdim (Torah Scholars) than the original Chassidim (or at a minimum took equally from both the Gra and Bal Shem Tov as the Bal Shem Tov had originally intended). Chassidim (at least many branches of them) sit and learn the same Torah as every other Orthodox Jew does. Please correct me if I am wrong, but I believe only a minority of Chassidim learn the Bal Shem Tov for 6 hours a day and only leave two hours for Talmudic study while the majority of them devote most of their learning time to halacha and gemara. The main difference between most forms of Orthodox Judaism and Chassidism is therefor not about core values or practices but rather about where the EMPHASIS should be put.

3) Samuel Heilman is in this film often and I had him as a professor at Queens College in '07. I felt he looks way too deeply into things and has an agenda. For example, he saw a Chassid say to a secular woman ""Have a nice day"" after handing her merchandise at work and turned it into this ""insight"" that I felt simply has no basis in reality.

4) I did not feel the spiritual arrogance attributed to Chassidim is warranted. Yes, some do feel this (typically the younger ones in their teens and twenties) towards secular Jews and non-Jews. However, the virtue of humility is more highly valued than everything else combined. The most taught saying is ""who is smart? the man who learns from every person."" The elitism mentioned in the film is taught to the youngsters in order to protect them from being envious of outside society and abandoning the Torah.

5) Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that only the garb and various stories of Chassidism started in the 18th century. The main components of Chassidism (shabbos, kosher and shomer negia (the ban of not touching women) are part of orthodox Judaism as a whole and has been practiced since the Torah was given.",1336435200,14,2685,4.5875
971458,5,6305120080,"I learned a great deal about Hasidism in the United States. I viewed the DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it. Some of the reviews, here, (I read them all.) seem longer than the documentary, itself.

971459,4,6305120080,"The Bottom Line:

Though conducted as a surface-level investigation, ""A Life Apart"" functions capably as an introduction to the lives of Hasidic Jews, and should be required counter-programming for anyone who ever had to see ""A Stranger Among Us.""",1229472000,,247,5.333333333333333

It gives information and (bless God!!) is sympathetic, but if the mind and professional expertise of the fim makers is there, the soul is not. And the soul, the neshameh, is an important thing in hassidism after all...",1216598400,7,397,4.685714285714286
971541,4,6305120080,"The adherents of all religions seek purity of one kind or another, but only a handful of nonmonastic religious communities believe that radical separation from the world is a necessary condition for it.  In the US, the Amish, the Hutterites, some of the more extreme fundamentalist Mormons, and the Hasidim are the religious groups which continue to live enclaved existences.  In ""A Life Apart,"" directors Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky explore the Hasidic community in NYC.

Most Hasidim came to the US in the wake of the holocaust.  Four out of five European Hasidim were exterminated by the Nazis.  After the war, the five surviving heads of Hasidic communities brought their people to the US to begin anew--not in search of the great American dream, as the film makes clear, but in search of a safe place to survive as an intact religious tradition.  Accordingly, Hasidim keep to themselves, retaining their mode of worship, their distinctive garb, their community mores and norms.  Their marriages continue to be arranged, their families continue to be hierarchical and patriarchal, children are educated apart from the world (and thus have many professional avenues closed to them), homes continue to lack television and computers.  Goyim are shunned, as are non-Hasidic Jews.  There is, as one interviewed scholar observes, a voluntary forsaking of the rich pluralism of American culture for the sake of a spiritual purity that, while rich in certain ways, can also be in-bred, sultifying for some, and arrogantly judgmental of outsiders.  (But enclaves in America are hard to maintain, and more and more Hasidim are forced by economic straits to work outside of their community.  The segment in the film devoted to this migration wonderfully features a klezmer rendition of ""New York, New York"" as background music.)

""A Life Apart"" does a good job of highlighting the benefits and disadvantages of Hasidic exclusivity, and in doing so helps viewers appreciate the challenges faced by all enclaved religious communities. But the film fails to convey adequately the incredible spiritual richness of the Hasidic tradition.  A few obligatory words are said about the Baal Shem Tov's focus on joy in religion, and his move away from legalistic and bookish Judaism.  But nothing is said about the specifics of his teachings nor of the Hasidic rebbes whom he inspired.  The upshot is that the film focuses on Hasidism primarily as a culture rather than a spiritual phenomenon.

Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker narrate the film.  It's worth pointing out that Parker's annoyingly amateurish schoolgirl mode of delivery, as well as her public image from ""Sex and the City"" as a material girl, make her an odd and distracting choice.",1213056000,5,2739,5.132882882882883
971542,5,6305120080,I loved the documentary.  I learned a lot about the Hadsidic community that I didn't know.  Highly recommend it!,1185667200,4,112,4.842105263157895
971543,5,6305120080,"The focus of this documentary is the Brooklyn Hasidic community. The sharp-eyed viewer can spot the twin towers of the World Trade center, rising above the apartments, in one of the scenes.

The Hasidic movement began as a reaction against what some had considered the excessively rule-oriented and punitive view of God that characterized Orthodox Judaism. In Vilna (Wilno, Vilnius), the then-current rabbis denounced the new movement as a heresy, and its members were excommunicated. Yet Hasidism went on to become the dominant form of Judaism in eastern Europe. In the 19th century, some of its member turned away to substitute religions--Zionism, socialism, and Communism.

For centuries, the Hassidim viewed America as a wild land that was amoral and materialistic. Many Hassidim who did come to America, having seen what they considered to be the sterility of conventional American Judaism, were ever more determined to retain their traditional way of life.

The Hasidic movement stresses encounters with God in everyday life. Asceticism is rejected. The seeker of God should try to lose oneself in a mystic state. Gladness is the key to encountering God, while sadness is a barrier to the same. One Hasid is quoted as thinking of God having committed sins against the people even as he was repenting of his sins against God at Yom Kippur.

The Hasidim believe in traditional family roles, and do not believe that anyone should take on a different role. Women dress modestly. Many Hasidic families are huge--sometimes with 10-14 children.",1183852800,7,1543,5.184738955823293
971544,5,6305120080,"I got this DVD and can't quit playing it.  The music is wonderful, there are intimite glances into the family lives of hasidim, their gatherings, etc.",1167782400,4,150,4.769230769230769
971545,4,6305120080,"Some of the other reviews here are by people with much more knowledge of the Hasidic way of life than I have, and point out problems with things said in the movie that went right by me.  So my perspective in reviewing this is as a curious outsider with some understanding of Judaism, a little understanding of the Hasidic path, and the curiosity to know more.

A Life Apart: Hasidism in America is a window into the insular Hasidic communities of New York City.  Narrated by Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker (I was rather shocked by the choice of SJP--could they have found anyone more a polar opposite of the women portrayed in this film than the woman who brought Carrie Bradshaw to life?  But both Nimoy and Parker do a very good job and have excellent ""documentary"" voices for narrating) the film is an overview of the Hasidic way of life as a whole, focusing on a few representative members talking about their own paths.

On the whole I found it very enjoyable and educational, and learned a lot from it.  For someone with little to no knowledge of Hasidim but some curiosity, it is a great introduction.  There is a historical overview of the origination and philosophy of the Hasidic way and the destruction of much of it in the era of the Soviets and the Nazis.  I was surprised to learn that Hasids steadfastly refused to emigrate to America, viewing it as a place that endangered their souls with its secularity, even up to the brink the Holocaust.  I had sort of thought that there was something of a Hasidic community in New York pre World War II, that grew and deepened with the arrival of postwar refugees.  But in reality, it was entirely a movement of postwar refugees and a few charismatic rebbes who gathered in the traumatized survivors and helped them recreate communities on this side of the ocean.  The size and fervor of the communities that have emerged after 60 years is a testament to their work and to the will to survive as individuals and people.

I found Jack Gold, the patriarch of a large Hasidic family, to be one of the most interesting people in the documentary.  He looks like an Orthodox rather than Hasidic Jew, wearing a kippah but without the hat, beard or side curls that his sons and grandsons wear.  But like them, his appearance is as much a testament to his own journey--from concentration camp survivor who had lost all religion, to someone who began to embrace it again in order to give his children something, but who still wears the scars of his own life.  As one of his sons says, he may not look it on the outside but he has a Hasidic heart.

While the glimpses of the various ceremonies and festivals were fascinating and give a hint to the level of joy in the Hasidic style of worship, the lack of explanation as to what was going on and what festival was being celebrated could often be confusing.  Footage jumps from Sukkot to Purim to a wedding to Shabbos to Chanukah with no explanation as to what you are seeing and what it all means.  I recommend watching the documentary once through and then with the directors commentary because it adds a lot to the understanding of these scenes.  But I shouldn't undermine the accomplishment that having any of these scenes is, because as a rule the Hasidim keep to themselves and do not like to interact with or be filmed or photographed by outsiders.

But even with the commentary I was often left with more questions--particularly about the roles of women.  The relatively few glimpses of the Hasidic women and insights into their lives left me wanting more, and I was also interested in the hints in both the documentary and commentary about the family members who had left the Hasid community (they had one female representative but even here there wasn't enough detail--I could have enjoyed an entire documentary just about her and her life) and people who had been raised less religious who had joined the Hasid community (again, there was one representative but I was particularly curious about the women who have done so and what the attraction and the result was for them).

On the whole this is a good introduction to both the joys and the difficulties and tensions of this way of life and is recommended for anyone curious about it.",1136937600,31,4248,4.598675496688742
971546,5,6305120080,"This wonderful documentary by Oren Rudavsky and Menachem Daum, which is narrated by Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker, offers the viewer a birdseye view of an interesting, insular, and little known, yet often misunderstood, sect of Judaism. Founded in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century, it is characterized by mysticism, prayer, and religious zeal. It is not a lifestyle for everyone, but it is certainly a lifestyle about which everyone should know.
Hasidim  are singular in their way of living. The men wear the same type of clothing that was worn in Eastern Europe in the eighteenth century, hats, which often serve to distinguish one Hasidic sect from another, black pants, black jackets, and white shirts. The men are bearded and sport the traditional ""payess"", or side curls. The women cover their heads with scarves or elaborate wigs and are always modestly clothed, covered from head to toe. The Hasidim adhere to the same customs as when they were first founded, speak Yiddish, seem to have a universal, collective mind, for the most part, and adhere to a strict, ultra-orthodox interpretation of Judaism.
The Hasidim came in large numbers to America sometime after World War II, peaking in the nineteen fifties. The narrators explain some of the reasons why the Hasidim, strangers in a strange land, were able to flourish. Many settled in New York City, and there are large communities of Hasidim in Brooklyn, where they try to co-exist with their non-Hasidim neighbors, not always successfully. They chiefly occupy the neighborhoods of Williamsburg, Crown Heights, and Boro Park. They even have their own town in upstste New York, Kiryas Joel. The documentary films the Hasidim in their downstate milieu and gives token recognition to how they are perceived by their non-Hasidim neighbors, who tend to view the self-imposed seclusion of the Hasidim as exclusion of themselves. To some extent they are correct, though not in the way one might think.
While there are a number of sects, such as the Bobovs, the Satmars, the Lubavitchers, just to name of few of the most prominent here in America, each sect is ruled by its own Rebbe who is the acknowledged leader of the sect and highly revered. The film dwells upon the  commonalities, rather than differences, that exist among the various sects. Their differences, however, are a story for another documentary. This film focuses more on giving the viewer a somewhat loving view of the Hasidim, touching only briefly upon the differences between the Hasidim and the non-Hasidim.  Quite frankly, in some neighborhoods, there is a cold war going on between these two factions. One need only come to Brooklyn, New York to see this.
The Hasidim tend to shun the media and do not watch films or television, for the most part. In fact, in watching the film, the viewer can see many Hasidim shielding themselves from the eye of the camera, so as not to appear. Some who did appear, however, expressed a justification for doing so. The Hasidim do not, as a whole, send their children to college to pursue a higher, secular education. The lack of higher education, however, precludes them from professional jobs such as lawyers, doctors, accountants, pharmacists, etc. They tend to work at jobs within their community where possible, though they will venture out into the larger non-Hasidic community for employment, when necessary. This is a source of concern for them and a test of their strength and resolve to adhere to their own ways, as such employment forces them to interact with a community with whom they normally would not.
The film also takes the viewer into one of their schools or Yeshivas, allowing the viewer to see how the children are acculturated from early on. The Hasidim are essentially fundamentalists, and, as are many fundamentalists, they are extremely narrow in their world view. The film also interviews Paula Gluck, an obviously intelligent and articulate, young woman who left the Hasidic community to live her life as she chose, to write and seek a higher education among the non-Hasidim. The film balances this defection by interviewing a man who affirmatively chose to become Hasidim, though his Jewish parents, holocaust survivors, were not. It is an even handed handling of two issues germaine to the Hasidim, those who leave and those who join. The Hasidim are not part of mainstream America, nor do they wish to be, though they cherish many of the values cherished by other Americans: family, home, hearth, and community. Marriages, however, are arranged by the parents, often through a matchmaker. This documentary memorializes a Hasidic wedding and illustrates the division of the men from the women, even during such a joyous occasion.
Whether one agrees or disagrees with their chosen way of life, however, this documentary is a most interesting film. Working in Brooklyn and finding myself often having to interact with the Hasidim, I absolutely loved this documentary, even though it was a bit of a white wash, leaving out some of the darker aspects of this segment of the Brooklyn community. One of the most important issues with respect to this community was entirely omitted. This was on the issue of their importance politically, as a group with which to be reckoned.  This group holds a great deal of political power, because they will follow their Rebbe's lead and vote as a block. Politicians in New York do not hesitate to curry favor with this group and court them because of it.  Most recently, the Hasidic community of Kiryas Joel in upstate New York made headlines for the way they voted in the race for U.S. Senator from New York and was the subject of much heated debate.
Still, for those unfamiliar with the Hasidim, this documentary will be an interesting and delightful revelation and will hold the interest of the viewer throughout. The documentary is well done, beautifully filmed, and clearly, a labor of love. Those viewers who are interested in other cultures, ultra-orthodox Judaism, or the religious beliefs of others will have a deep appreciation for this wonderful and informative documentary.",1029628800,96,6124,5.017699115044247
971547,5,6305120080,"Seven years in the making, this 1997 documentary is about the elusive community of Hassidic Jews in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.  Founded in the 18th century in Poland, they preached a joy in living and kept their way of dress through the centuries, refusing to flee as the Holocaust approached, believing that God meant them to stay where they were.  As a result, more than 80% of them were killed, and many of the survivors emigrated to the United States in the early 1950s. A minority within a minority, they choose to live apart from secular America and think of themselves as something like the early pilgrims, who left their home country, not to assimilate, but to worship as they please.  New Yorkers have grown used to seeing the men in their long black outfits and side curls and the women in modest dresses and wigs.  Few have penetrated their community.  And many wonder about it.  But in this film, the filmmakers, who are Hasidic themselves, show a bit of this closed world.
Narrated by Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker, we learn the history and get to meet some of the people.  We see the large and close-knit families, the early education, the rituals of the classroom.  All marriages are arranged and we meet a marriage broker and listen to a young man tell about his wedding.  We see the way the girls are educated to be wives and mothers although there are some women who speak out about the inequality of this, and we meet Pearl Gluck, a writer who has broken away from the community.  We also meet an African American man who raises questions about his Hasidic neighbors and their aloofness and inability to see his religion as important as their own.
I found the video well done and quite interesting, with good choices of subjects and cinematography, especially in showing the faces of the children.  I know I learned a lot but I wanted to know more.  The film makes their lives seem idyllic.  Too much so.  But it's a good introduction to a way of life of a people who are sometimes shrouded in mystery.  And it certainly is a part of this grand mosaic that is America.

Don't pass it up because you'll want to watch this one again and again. Why? Well, for one thing, it is 90 minutes of absolutely fascinating portraits of Hasidic Judaism, covering a range of values, views and lifestyles - more diversity than you might imagine in a group often seen as insular and restricted. For another, it isn't a one-sided film but one with with heart and integrity. It shows the harsh side as well as the beautiful side of the Hasidic world. There are interviews with people who resent Hasidic Jews or who think they're strange or ""weird"". But there are also rare and beautiful glimpes into the Hasidic lifestyle, mystical stories, lovely music. All in a context that makes clear that the Hasidim place a high value on family, community and, of course, spirituality.
  My only quibble is that they didn't show a non-Jewish woman who converted to Hasidic Judaism and I know there are plenty of those out there.

So, please... if you watch this movie (and I do recommend it!), be aware that these caricatures are not representative.  Most members of these communities are hard-working and devout; the ""dropout rate"" is astonishingly low.  But that's a little less interesting on film, so you've got to take what you can get.

One of the main problems, as other reviewers mentioned, was the narration.  For the life of me, I could not imagine what the two directors of the film, Menachem Daum and Oren Rudavsky, were thinking by getting Leonard Nimoy and Sarah Jessica Parker as co-narrators.  But the second night when I went back to watching the rest of the DVD, it strangely started at the beginning again with the directors' narrative on.  Apparently, they got those two actors because Mr. Nimoy is Jewish, Ms. Parker has a sister who became Orthodox, and they both agreed to do the narration for free.  Next time, if  Mr. Daum and Mr. Rudavsky work together again on a documentary, they  might want to find narrators who work for pay. Leonard Nimoy's voice was too weak, and he sounded like he was simply talking, not narrating.  Even worse, Sarah Jessica Parker sounded like a teenager reading a school book report.

The film itself, though,  was very educational, especially for those viewers not familiar with Hasidism, or those who know something about the faith but never put all the pieces together.  There is some historical background, but mostly the documentary concerns itself with everyday life for today's Hasidics, including the education of their many, many children. There are lots of first person accounts from average Hasidics, as well as comments from  scholars.  My favorite scholar in the film was Rabbi Arthur Hertzberg.  (The exception being he made it sound like no Hasidics become professionals, which obviously they do.) Rabbi Hertzberg was also interviewed in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Faith-and-Fortune-The-Reichmann-Story/dp/B009WFIPQK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Faith and Fortune: The Reichmann Story</a>, an excellent documentary with, one might add, excellent narration. (Stream it from Amazon, and see the huge difference between a film with good narration and a film with bad narration.)

By the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Life-Apart-Hasidism-in-America/dp/B00005JG6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Life Apart - Hasidism in America</a>, I knew so much more about Hasidism than I did before watching the film.  But I also found myself irritated at the end by the scene of the Bobov Rebbe dancing at a wedding.  The dancing and chanting was going on to long, in my opinion. (It was late.)  But suddenly they was a caption going across the screen, which said he was the last rebbe to bring his community to America from the Holocaust, and the camera moved from the dancing rebbe to those watching and chanting . . . countless Orthodox Jews.  It was hard to not then picture all the Jews during WWII being put in cattle cars and killed in concentration camps . . . at which time, I no longer thought the dancing and chanting was going on too long . . . but should continue in the joyous way it was going . . . on and on and on.  Rebbes must have strong hearts.",1423958400,,3201,5.520491803278689
