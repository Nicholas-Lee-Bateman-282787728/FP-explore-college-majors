1819724,4,B00007L4N7,"Hey now, the way this starts out seems fairly innocent, including a young couple making love in a phone booth while on the phone to the young man's mother, but you sense that things are not what they seem when the young man takes a liking to a goat in the garden during an early morning stroll, WHOA.  And things build from there.  This squeaky clean young couple are not at all what they seem to be, and they proceed to off every pervert, sexual deviant, and drug addict that they can find while still managing to maintain that they're just there to have a nice time.  And I supposed they ARE having a nice time, but kee-ripes!  After having seen a few other films by Nico Mastorakis this has to be one of his most disturbing and thought-provoking pictures.  It's definitely a strange mix of things, Greek folk music, American folk music, hippies, and ex-patriate Americans & Brits who apparently came there to enjoy what they were not appreciated for elsewhere.  A nasty little film that will stay with you for a while, and I'd recommend it.",1106438400,2,1043,4.5212765957446805
1819725,3,B00007L4N7,"This movie is not of interest to everyone, only those that enjoy watching films that push the limits of what an audience is willing to watch.  If you are a gore hound, then this probably isn't the movie for you, as it has hardly any gore and minimal blood. Not to say that there isn't violence, most of it just happens off camera. The real interesting part of this movie is the perverse acts that the main characters partake in. These acts include rape, murder, torture and bestiality. If you are interested in watching a movie that has very poor acting and a paper thin script, just to see what lengths a film may go to try to get banned, then this is the movie for you.
The director has an interview on the DVD in which he states that this movie was only made to shock people and make money. He said that they were wanting to cash in on the success of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. While this movie is nowhere near the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, for the right audience, this movie has its place.",1066176000,14,994,4.315508021390374
1819726,2,B00007L4N7,"Island of Death.  Sounded like a cheesy ""Dawn of the Dead"" type Romero rip-off.  Could be fun--what the heck?  I bought it.  And I'm sorry I did.
Most disgusting movie ever?  Puhleeze!  Not even close.  The so-called 'disgusting' scenes are thrown in as an afterthought just to sell movies (the director freely admits this in an interview on the DVD).  And they just aren't very disturbing.  If they were at least funny, that would be something.  But they aren't even that.
For a movie covering such a bloody subject, there are almost no graphic scenes whatsoever.  The director tries to make this a virtue of the movie, saying the viewer's ""imagination"" provides the graphic elements.  Bull-pucky.  They just didn't know how to do it.  They were incompetent, and it shows.  Look--if Peter Jackson can figure out how to do it on $30,000, then these people can too.  Deal with it.
Please don't buy this movie.  It's not scary, not creepy, not disturbing, and not entertaining.  Maybe if you are planning a trip to Mykonos you can get a feel for the island.  But that's about it.",1062720000,6,1077,4.693548387096774
1819727,4,B00007L4N7,"You have to hand it to Greek director Nico Mastorakis: in a lengthy interview included on the DVD version of his 1975 exploitation classic ""Island of Death,"" he blatantly admits that he created this movie in order to make money. After viewing ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in Europe, Mastorakis knew he could create something comparable to the upsetting images he saw on the screen. Shortly after this event, he sat down and wrote the script for ""Island of Death,"" intentionally imbuing it with the most shocking and nauseating of situations. The difference between Mastorakis and the majority of exploitation directors is that this Greek knows how to direct a film. ""The Island of Death"" is not so much a gritty movie as it is a series of striking contrasts captured beautifully on film. Don't get me wrong; it is sure to deliver a few jolts to even the most hardened of horror fans, with its over the top sadism and blas&eacute; attitude about violence.
Two British tourists named Christopher and Celia arrive on the Greek island of Mykonos in order to see the sights and rub elbows with the locals. Christopher likes the island because it has 350 churches spread across the landscape, meaning that the people on the island are especially religious. This perceived religiosity of the locals gives Christopher and Celia the idea that people of loose moral standards and questionable backgrounds aren't welcome. Therefore, Christopher decides Mykonos is the perfect place to start a personal pogrom against the local degenerates. The two embark on a bloody rampage of bizarre violence against select segments of the population by torturing, mutilating, and killing a French painter, two homosexuals, a lesbian, and a woman who sleeps around. Christopher is definitely the ringleader in these appalling crimes, and since he considers himself an angel of God sent to restore decency to the world, there exists not a whit of guilt about the crimes committed by the couple. For some inexplicable reason, Celia and Christopher tote a camera around with them in order to capture the carnage on film so they can gloat about their acts afterwards in the privacy of their rented cottage. Despite the fact that there is a private detective on their tail, Chris and Celia possess little reservations about upping the body count. Predictably, there exists a bit of a twist ending that really doesn't come as much of a shock in this type of film. Let's just say that one of the two get their comeuppance in the final scenes.
A lot of hype surrounds this film. The fact that Britain banned its release for many years seems to fuel many people's desire to see it. After viewing ""The Island of Death,"" I readily understood why British censors balked at giving this one a pass. At least one sexual situation involves an activity more suited to a fetish film, but overall, Mastorakis skimps on excessive blood and gore. We see the killings and tortures, but the camera usually cuts away before any serious sauce flows. The disturbing elements of the film don't come from great special effects; rather, it's the idea of seeing someone forced to drink whitewash, die by hanging off a moving plane, receive a bath in lime, and have their face burned with flaming aerosol. The crude crucifixion performed on the hapless painter certainly didn't give those censors any breathing room, either. So, for those interested in ""The Island of Death"" because they think it is loaded with gore, you have been alerted that this film does not contain much in the way of substantial grue.
I wrote that this picture is a series of striking contrasts, and that's because the island of Mykonos is a gorgeously picturesque backdrop for the nightmare unfolding in the camera's foreground. The smartly whitewashed houses, the narrow streets, the lapping waves, the bright blue skies, and the wide-open fields look great while presenting a troubling contrast to the atrocities committed by Christopher and Celia. This is where the picture quality of the DVD comes in: the transfer is splendid; with colors so vivid it feels as though you are on the island itself. Mastorakis's use of background coupled with imaginative camera angles creates a truly memorable film experience. There are few horror/exploitation films with the type of marvelous cinematography found in ""Island of Death."" Add in the unusual soundtrack, and you have yourself a winner here.
Still, this movie is a rather low budget number, with some awkward acting and jarring edits that disturb the flow of the film. The lack of gore is disappointing for hardcore gorehounds such as myself (as if the disgusting subject matter isn't enough!), but overall I really enjoyed this movie. The interview with Mastorakis, who comes across as a friendly chap, illuminates many of the finer points of the film, providing a sort of mini-commentary track conveying lots of information on the production of the film, the actors, and the critical reactions to the project. The only other extras on the disc are music videos of the songs in the movie. ""Island of Death"" may not approach the levels of offensiveness found in such classics as ""Cannibal Holocaust"" or ""Salo,"" but it is still a grimly effective little picture capable of clearing a packed movie theater if it chose to do so.",1062547200,35,5296,4.951685393258427
1819728,1,B00007L4N7,"Hey, don't let the words of ""controversy"" and ""banned"" lure you into even wasting your time with this piece of junk.  And don't let all the negative reviews lead you towards the conclusion that ""it's so bad, it's good.""  Don't get suckered in like me.  The only controversy that I can justify is how did this ever get financed in the first place?  And how did it generate such a cult following... enough so that it gets a DVD release in front of more deserved titles like THE DEVILS, QUICK CHANGE, ABBY, BLACULA, etc.

One scene involving death by paint asphyxiation is particularly laughable, the paint is so unconvicingly subbed for by whole milk it renders the entire escapade moot.

1819732,5,B00007L4N7,"That's the only way I can really describe this truly mental shocker filmed and set on the Greek holiday island of Mykonos.  In this one, an outwardly likeable young couple land there, but it soon becomes apparent that the male side of the couple (Bob Belling) is a religious hypocrite - and a psychotic, raping one at that!  He thinks he's God's avenging angel, and positively revels in his work, though his girlfriend (Jane Ryall) is equally as nuts.
What follows is one of the most jaw-droppingly trashy and sleazy displays of rape, golden-showers, bestiality, torture, murder and weird Greek ballads that's ever been put onto film.  None of it's hardcore and the Mykonos locations look superb, but the film remains an astonishingly scuzzy affair despite all that.

1819764,4,B00007L4N7,"This might be one of the sleaziest, nastiest, filthiest movies I have ever seen, and I loved every minute of it!  Let's not take too much time thinking about what that says about me, instead lets talk about one of the craziest films to come out of the 1970's, ISLAND OF DEATH.

  This film has been hard to find on DVD lately, only being available in an out of print DVD from Image Entertainment. Luckily, the wonderful folks at Arrow Films have got their hands on this film and have released it as a beautiful Blu-ray/DVD combo pack which is being distributed through MVD Entertainment.  This new 2K restoration of the film is pretty amazing.  From the film quality there is now way you could guess that the film was over 38 years old!  Arrow always does a remarkable job with their releases and this one is no different.

  The film itself is one that is really hard to explain.  The only real story is that a couple go on vacation to a Greek island and then just kill people at random. That's about it!  But, the way they go about it is what makes this movie.  They take pride on killing people in pretty unique ways, many times after just seducing them and/or having sex with them.  To say this is a strange movie would be a remarkable understatement.

  The movie is very hard to categorize as well.  While it's horror for sure, it has elements of a giallo, exploitation, and sexsploitation film as well.  If you have never had a chance to see this wonderfully messed up film, now is the time to do so with this wonderful Arrow release.",1447200000,,1541,4.400709219858156

would get the distribution rights to this film and put the time and money into a HD Remastering of
Island of Death

This film has gained a major cult status mostly due to it's over the top sex & violence

newlyweds go on there honeymoon to Greek island of Mykonos
you learn something is off about the male character
when he is banging his wife in the phone booth while talking to his mother on the phone!

It just gets weirder and weirder the guys is a sociopath who dislikes men who cheat on there wives!  just about anyone on this island isn't safe from the two Bonnie and Clyde wannabes
who just wanna kill everyone
If they don't kill them they trying have sex with others  (Including a goat near the start of the film)
While they are murdering they take photos of the killing with a instant camera (that way there is evidence/proof of there crimes all of there hotel room)
a cop is introduces into the film but, the love birds run from him (escaping piloting a two man airplane) where the cop gets hung up on while high above the sky needless to say he gets hung off a wing! then they cut his lifeless body down! **Spoiler**
The cop is only introduced just to kill him imo to add more of a body count

This film is more or less smoke and mirrors it's a very cheap exploitation film that tries to much
Is it the worst so-called Horror film ever?
No
It's passable but, it's a one trick pony though once you see it once you'll probably never care about seeing it again

It's gained this infamous cult status for being banned and put on the list of video nasty
(for extreme gore violence, sex/nudity,)
The wrap-around twist ending is meh
There are much better exploitation films out there (I Spit On Your Grave comes to mind it's dark and very hard to watch but, at least the story and the pacing all flow the right way this film is very disjointed
The film just tries way to hard to be edgy and over the top way to much
It's very much contrived and the opposite Texas Chainsaw!
Does it live up to to infamous it has gained over the years
Not a bit 5/10
The asking price  on this BR Import is insane you better be a super fan don't be a first time viewer and decide to buy the BR
Cause you like the artwork or something it's average at best

1819767,5,B00007L4N7,"It's brutal. If your into Texas Chainsaw type flicks you'll love it, if not stay away. It's not that Island movie that had Michael Caine.",1441843200,2,137,4.52
1819768,2,B00007L4N7,"There are a lot of movies making their way to DVD these days from companies that are offering them in the best format possible with some interesting extras as well. Ive spoken about the fact that Arrow Video seems to be a company determined to release many of these movies in a format that compares to Criterion except when it comes to their costs. Are all of the movies great? By all means no. But that doesnt discount the historical or fan based needs for these films. While they may not be everyones favorites enough people are out there who will enjoy them enough for their release.

With that in mind I just finished ISLAND OF THE DEAD. In viewing the extras director Nico Mastorakis is said to have seen the movie TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE in a theater with a friend and then set out to make a movie of his own with the goal of offending as many people as possible. Considering the release of this movie was 1976 I think he accomplished his goal. Many movies have since surpassed this for being offensive or outrageous but for 1976 this would have rankled more than a few censors.

The film starts with a couple arriving on a small Greek island for an apparent vacation. It doesnt take long for us to find out that Christopher is actually a serial killer on the lam and Celia is knowingly with him on the run. The couple meets a very stereotypically gay character who invites them to his wedding later that night. They check into a place he recommends and then head out to discover the island.  While doing so, Christopher calls his mother on the phone to make her listen while he has sex with Celia in the phone booth in public. Unfortunately the police have tapped her phone and one dedicated officer heads their way.

But honestly the phone booth sequence is one of the tamest items on Mastorakis list. The movie plays as a series of small adventures the couple go through as they go from spot to spot on the island, deal with that dedicated officer and the end result of their journey. Rather than describe each incident here are the items that occur at one point or another during the movie: incest, nailing a man to a concrete slab, having sex with a goat and then killing the goat (Im guessing because he was afraid the goat might tell someone?), urination on someone, heroin use, lesbian sex scene, forcing a gay man to place a pistol in his mouth, several killings, rape (both sexes) and a few other items. While some of these things take place in other films one can only imagine the shocked expressions of various film boards in 1976 when this film was screened.

In the end does the movie offer an evening of entertainment? I for one would have to say not at all. While not near as shocking today as it was when released, it still leaves a bad taste in your mouth after viewing it. It also leaves you wondering what was the point in watching this? If it was indeed just an attempt to shock and offend people then the director succeeded in his goal. Why that would be someones goal is beyond me. With TEXAS CHAINSAW at least there was a story being told. It also didn't go to the extremes that this film does.

Does the film need to be released on blu-ray now for any other reason? I would say yes. Fans of the film will want the best copy they can find. Historians of film having lost so many to deterioration and the like are always glad to find any and all films saved in one format or another. Arrow also does another fine job with their extras including an interview with the director and a documentary about his films.

If you're a gore hound, if you like movies that are filled with shock value, if you collect odd films, if you are not easily offended then perhaps youll enjoy this movie. For the majority of people out there I think youd do better to stick with the more popular fare being offered.",1438300800,,3822,4.397454031117397

All this movie is made for was shock value and it even fails on that end of it. The plot is that a psychotic couple go to this Greek island and start killing off people they meet. That's it, thats all there is to it!! It's all about killing.
 All of the murders scenes are so contrived and pretty hokey that it's pretty laughable. I wouldn't even call this film so bad it's good category. It's just lame, predictable, uninteresting and amateurish at best. Stick with Natural Born Killers for this kind of film.",1433894400,,654,4.45
1819770,2,B00007L4N7,"Island of Death is a horror film that intentionally sets out to gross out the audience. An attractive British couple, Christopher and Celia, arrive on the idyllic Greek island, Mykonos. The welcoming locals don't realize that the pair are murderous degenerates, determined to spread their own brand of perversion across the island. Director Nico Mastorakis pulls out all the stops in presenting vile, disgusting, and nauseating images, including immolation by blowtorch, sword skewering, and decapitation by plow blade. Made to outdo the excesses of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Island of Death never achieves the terror level of that film.

The films theme is that monsters come in all varieties. They don't have to be ugly, deformed, and physically grotesque. Often. monsters come in pretty packages. When the grisliness begins, its all the more startling to realize that these two nice looking young people are in the same league as Hannibal Lecter and Charles Manson  maybe even worse.

Aside from the violence, the movie contains considerable nudity and strong sexual scenes. Most of these are voyeuristic, as the couple enjoy photographing each other in the throes of sex.

Unlike so many horror films that take place at night, in dank basements, in deserted woods, or in dimly lit buildings, Island of Death plays up the natural beauty of Mykonos. The sun is shining against white buildings, and the area has the look of a paradise on earth. When the carnage begins, the juxtaposition of setting and gruesome acts makes for quite a contrast.  Much of the films original shock value has been dimmed by time and the increased violence in subsequent horror films, but be aware that this is still pretty strong stuff and definitely not for the squeamish.

Bonus features include an archive interview with director Nico Mastorakis, alternate opening titles, five original tracks from the films soundtrack, trailer reel, reversible sleeve with original and newly commissioned art work, and a collectors booklet featuring a historical overview of the movie.",1432598400,,2057,5.218181818181818

Having watched it a couple of times now I can honestly say that the term 'nasty' really sums up my impressions of it. Set on an idyllic Greek island, the plot revolves around a strange brother/sister duo who go on a killing spree while on holiday there - dispatching a lot of relatively innocuous individuals for no apparent good reason, other than the 'brother' takes exception to their 'way of being' (he is a bit of a moralistic jerk - despite his own incestuous & homicidal tendencies). The 'sister' is portrayed as a bit of an 'un-willing' accomplice to many of the ghastly deeds her brother perpetuates and she manages to get naked alot throughout the proceedings, 'pairing' with both men and women, often as a prequel to their imminent demise. The methods of killing employed are all decidedly 'nasty' as well - people are crucified & 'drowned' by being forced to drink 'whitewash', decapitated by a bulldozer, speared with a sickel, and hung from a flying airplane - to name but a few! By the time the ironic & bizarre conclusion arrives the viewer is definitely ready for the perpetrator to get his karmic cum uppance! If ever there was a film which displays little 'redeeming relevance' and, possibly, deserved to be banned as a 'nasty' - this is it! Which is to say - it was pretty enjoyable! The DVD release from Arrow Video is very nice - the transfer quality is fine and there are some good extras on the disc, and a nice little booklet of background info included. The ultra-tacky box cover art alone is worth the price. This is certainly not a 'great' film, but it is a fun watch - especially if U R feeling particularly 'nasty'.",1334620800,,1823,4.5105740181268885

If I feel dirty, uncomfortable and a little ashamed for watching it, then the movie has served its' purpose. Though ""Island of Death"" has been on the notorious Video Nasties list for years, it doesn't deserve to rank among the worst-of-the-worst.

Young couple vacationing on a beautiful Greek Island embark on a grisly killing spree, offing the residents in the most unpleasant of ways after degrading and ridiculing their victims: crucifixion, decapitation, human BBQ, close-range gunfire. Add to the mix golden showers and beastiality and you have a picture that should shock and repulse but the most shocking aspect is that it fails to evoke any emotion in the viewer. The best parts are the unintentional comedy by way of an over-the-top gay innkeeper, middle-aged nympho and deranged shepherd.

Perhaps the beautiful cinematography and stark white architecture wasn't the right atmosphere in which to stage such unpleasant set pieces; or the fact that the effects are none-too-convincing; the bottom line is--don't believe the hype. There are much gorier, trashier '70s flicks than this to 'enjoy' if that's your cup of tea. If you're still interested in seeking this out, you can find it free streaming online.

Director Mastorakis artfully captures the beauty of a tropical paradise, and contradicts this appealing imagery with the most blatant and disgusting events.  70's exploitation, here..we..GO!

A sadistic couple wrecks havoc by roaming around the island committing random acts of violence.  Sex, torture, murder, impregnating animals...ah yes, good times.  They are supposedly punishing the wicked, doing God's good will.

For a film that was immediately banned, the violence doesn't get especially graphic.  Much of the heinous crimes occur just off screen, with the brutality implied in a harsh, uncomfortable manner.  There's lots of sex with full frontal shots, plus incest thrown in just for kicks.  To top it off there is some humor as well, although it might just offend many.

The killers proceed on their savage mission with absolutely no respect for human life.  Very nonchalant with their slayings, which is unsettling but also hard to fathom.  Plus the acting in this isn't particularly convincing.  Still, all-in-all this is a worthy cult film bound to appease fans of exploitation cinema.",1235865600,,1590,5.196850393700787

It's not because of the violence, sex, or perversions that are depicted in the film but because the film is such crap that viewers may be inclined to exact bodily harm upon whomever was responsible for their having sat through this piece of sheet.  Nothing at all about this film is shocking or disturbing; remotely comical perhaps, but certainly not worthy of having a reputation.  The acting and the dialog was some of the worst I have ever seen.  In fact, I only give this movie a few stars because I sort of liked the music.

1819791,4,B00007L4N7,"Yes, it's true that writer/director Nico Mastorakis created 1975's ISLAND OF DEATH for the sole purpose of riding on the coattails of the success and popularity of Tobe Hooper's now-classic THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974)--i.e., he did it just to make money--but that doesn't mean that the film isn't worth watching.  Even when the impetus is financial gain, a true aesthete can't simply turn off the skills and talents.  Admittedly, the acting abilities of the principals in ISLAND OF DEATH fall noticeably short, but Mastorakis' cinematic abilities are clearly evident.

The film is expertly directed, wonderfully photographed, and the writing is way above that of the average low-budget fare served up in this genre. In spite of his intentions to whip up a quick little moneymaker, Mastorakis manages to cook up a gritty but nonetheless compelling little satire that harshly but literately addresses such social issues as unfettered hedonism and sexual promiscuity, religious expediency, homophobia, incest, and much more.

So the film elements do, as a whole, reveal that the Mastorakis is talented and cares about the ultimate quality of his work.  But it also offers fans of the splatter-film genre those elements that they crave.  Indeed, there is T&A aplenty--cute and curvy little blonde Jane Ryall, who plays the female lead, peels off her attire several times throughout, and other beauties also appear in the buff from time to time--and though many of the actual killings take place just out of frame, blood still splashes into the picture, and the various methods of homicide depicted are fresh (even today!) and creative enough to keep the most ardent genre fans happy.

By today's standards, the violence and sexual subject matter are hardly shocking to Western viewers, but at the time of its release, ISLAND OF DEATH was banned in many countries and heavily edited in others.  It was still a groundbreaker at the time, though, and those familiar with the horror and splatter films of the era will easily recognize the influence it has had, along with its progenitor THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE, on important genre films that followed.

The DVD distributed by Image Entertainment offers a beautifully restored, uncut version of ISLAND OF DEATH in its original aspect ratio (in spite of claims to the contrary) of roughly 1.33:1.  Also included is a fascinating interview with director Mastorakis, as well as some videos featuring songs from the film's original score.  This wonderful version of a cinematic icon is well worth the price of admission.",1110326400,18,2570,5.139088729016787
1819792,5,B00007L4N7,"Island of Death is among the most sought after cult classics I know. The film has many different names created mainly for video releases. The most usual names are Island of Death (I use this name on this review), Island of Perversions, Psychic Killer 2, Craving for Lust and Devils In Mykonos, the latter being the intended name for the film, according to the director. The film is one of the most notorious video nasties in Britain and has been cut, banned and loathed everywhere during all these years, and it hasn't lost plenty of its power to shock and disgust and it is now as sleazy as it was back then in 1975.

The ""story"" is about a couple, Christopher and Celia, that arrives on a Greek island (Mykonos) and start to kill and torture people they consider sinful or dirty. This includes homosexuals, lesbians, nymphomaniacs and other sexual minorities. The film hasn't any significant plot and all that happens is just from one victim to another, from one violent/perverse act to another.

At this point, I'll tell you that there is one little and nasty plot turn at the end of the film, so BE CAREFUL when/if you read other reviews on Amazon and elsewhere, because I've noticed couple of ""reviews"" that SPOIL that end twist and by knowing what the twist is, the whole viewing experience will be toned down and different. So please NOTE THIS WARNING ABOUT SPOILERS FOUND ON SOME REVIEWS ON AMAZON AND ELSEWHERE!! I definitely won't even hint about what the plot turn is, and I'm glad for being able to warn you others who haven't seen the film yet!

Back to the film: It is obvious that these cheap exploitation films usually haven't got any cinematic merits as great photography, atmosphere and so on, but Island of Death is a little exception, as the photography is at times very beautiful as some scenes were shot at the beach and at night, and their visuality show that director Mastorakis is pretty noteworthy film maker. Also, camera angles and use of camera is occasionally interesting and again prove the talent of Mastorakis. But those are perhaps the only cinematically positive things I found in this film, and since the film was originally made to be disgusting and perverse, on that level it definitely works!

It is interesting to know that Mastorakis has made many noteworthy productions, too, with stars like Nastassja Kinski and George Kennedy, and he has said, that Island of Death was made ONLY because of money and he had to get it at the time. That is exactly the case also with Umberto Lenzi and his rough and sadistic cannibal films Eaten Alive and Cannibal Ferox, which the director has said he made only because of money he needed badly that time, in the early 1980's. Mastorakis knew that, at the time he started to think about Island of Death, there were many nasty and cheap exploitation films (like Ilsa series etc.) making money, so he decided to try the same and write a movie as perverse, violent, nasty and sadistic as possible and then sell it and make plenty of dollars for more ambitious and interesting future film projects. That succeeded, and he has never done anything like Island of Death again, but still he is willing to talk about the film and telling interesting things about it. He says that the film is not his look of life and he is not some sick psycho who likes stuff committed on screen, and he did the film entirely because of monetary reasons. The inspiration for this kind of thing came when he saw Tobe Hooper's Texas Chain Saw Massacre and understood how cheap it was to make and how much money it made for its makers. Texas and Island are of course very different films and Texas is great and artistic overall, but the inspiration for Island of Death came after the director saw Texas and realized that similar (distantly, though) film could be made by him, also.

*MINOR SPOILERS DEPICTING THE ACTS OF VIOLENT MAYHEM COMMITTED ON THE FILM COMING; NOT ANY HUGE SPOILERS, THOUGH!*

The film was intended to shock and disgust and that it definitely delivers. There are scenes of rape, bestiality, goat sodomy, sword slashing, decapitation, impalement, urinating on an old and horny female and other similar acts of violence and perversion. There is also a pretty disgusting scene where a man is forced to drink paint while being crucified to the ground. This all sounds pretty vile, but the film is not as bloody or gory as one might think by now; of course it is sick and offensive, but not any gore-fest blood bath, so no one should raise the expectations too high. I wasn't disappointed at all, I just wanted to see this rare gem, but I know some may think it was too ""soft"" which is definitely isn't. If you still think - having seen the film - this is not nasty, read the beginning of this paragraph again and ask yourself: doesn't this really sound sick to me? The most politically incorrect scene is of course the scene where Chris rapes a goat and then kills it with a knife. For all the animal lovers out there (like myself), I can confirm that the director himself has said that the animal was NOT really killed (or raped) and they only stunned it for couple of hours and then shot the scene with fake blood and effects. And also, no human was hurt or abused during the making of Island of Death!",1108512000,5,5270,4.601063829787234

7978104,4,B00007L4N7,"A phenomenal and perverse cult movie from the 1970s, filmed on the island of Mykonos. A young couple arrive in the off-season and quickly settle in to photograph the natives and keep a journal, but something is very, very wrong. Soon people are dying in horrendous ways. And those not busy dying are busy having sex in various combinations. Yes, a young goat is involved in one infamous scene, and there are Frenchmen, lesbians, unsavory hippies, and a horny shepherd who lives in the hills above the town and cinches up his torn trousers with a piece of rope. Here too you can witness the precursor of today's homosexual weddings; this was truly a film ahead of its time!

The demons have truly come to the peaceful little Greek island, and this strangely beautiful little slasher film is out to shock amid the photographic splendor. Directed by Greek exploitation director Nico Mastorakis and with some very odd but seductive songs on the soundtrack. They will keep running through your head long after the fake blood has dried.

With a heated performance by Robert Behling as the handsome but self-righteous angel of death, Christopher, and a seductive non-performance by Jane Lyle as Celia his lover and muse. (They share a surprising past.) Just drop all inhibitions and enjoy it for what it is.",1475884800,4,1300,4.851351351351352

The soundtrack on this film is also very enjoyable. Like all of Arrow's releases, the features are amazing on this.
