7801972,5,1935587412,Dr. Guliuzza informs you on just what a miracle it takes for pregnancy to occur. Though my mother was a biology teacher I'm sure she knew very few of the many details that the doctor details. He presents this information in a humorous and very interesting manner and throughout he ascribes the glory to the ultimate Creator. I have seen this several times but had to get my own DVD to share with friends and my children and grandchildren.,1519948800,,438,4.556962025316456
