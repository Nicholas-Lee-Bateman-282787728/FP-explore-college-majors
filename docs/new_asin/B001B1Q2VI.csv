3479437,5,B001B1Q2VI,"Contrary to other less favorable reviews, I felt this film adaptation of Archer's masterpiece, First Among Equals was right on the mark despite the variations in plot for screenplay. Having studied the Westminster system of government, it was not challenging to understand the nuances in administrative and parliamentary procedure. For those not acquainted with British constitutional and political practices, it can be somewhat perplexing.

As a real fan of the book, I was blown away by Jeremy Child's portrayal of Charles Seymour. They couldn't have found anyone more appropriate to play that role.

I have already watched it twice. Worth every penny.",1288656000,,654,5.401960784313726
3479438,1,B001B1Q2VI,I frankly found this film to be very boring & predicatable inspite of a fine cast of actors who did their best to save this turkey. I urge you to save your money and read Lord Jeffrey Archer's excellent book that this film was based upon instead.,1288051200,,246,4.25531914893617
3479439,4,B001B1Q2VI,"Americans find British politics fascinating, with its labyrinthine old boy networks and swiftly shifting alliances and loyalties, not to mention those career derailing votes of no confidence. First Among Equals follows four newly minted MPs from the day they take their oaths in 1966 through the next twenty-five years.  Because of the title, we know that one of these gentlemen will wind up as Prime Minister. Aside from the great characters, it's interesting to watch the Viet Nam War, Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis through this British prism.

Fans of the book should know that Charles Hampton, resident of Eaton Square has become Charles Seymour of Knightsbridge.  The character of Andrew Fraser has been added to the original trio and some of the events that happened to other characters in the book have been transferred to Fraser and his family and a few other things have been changed--like the ending.

The issues and pressures facing Seymour, Gould, Kerslake and Fraser are the same ones that show up in headlines all the time. Family obligations, marital difficulties, greed, the ever present power struggles and the weakness of character that leads to legal difficulties and vulnerability to blackmail.  All four have very different relationships with their wives and the wives' roles are as complicated and juicy as the four main characters.  The characters are neither caricature nor stereotype which makes for very rewarding viewing.

Though it's wonderful that Acorn has made this series available on DVD, the quality is great. Originally recorded on tape instead of flim, the transcription to disc does nothing for that almost painful shallowness of picture that is peculiar to tape.  Some of the sound is muffled making dialogue difficult to understand, sometimes the images are indistinct, and there is one scene where everything is outlined in magenta.  Still, I'd rather have an imperfect version than none at all, but don't expect high quality.

Special features are filmographies of the four main characters and a two screen biography of Jeffrey Archer.

A quarter of a century from its first airing, besides the quality of the DVD, First Among Equals is still compelling. That was a pleasant surprise, since I really enjoyed it in 1986 and was afraid it wouldn't age well.  Another reviewer said that the actors in the principal roles do not fit Mr. Archer's descriptions.  Perhaps that's true, but after reading the book and seeing the series, it's difficult to imagine anyone else playing those roles.

Here's the thing:  In my opinion, the book ended perfectly. The miniseries did not, and when I saw it, I felt cheated.  Despite the poor quality of the transfer to DVD, I would have rated it five stars had it stuck to the story. It's still worth seeing, just not five stars worth.",1271376000,2,2820,5.045258620689655
3479440,5,B001B1Q2VI,"""First Among Equals"" is primarily about the ambitions and educations of four aspiring British politicians from the 1960s to the end of the 1980s.
  We watch them learn, grow, and become who they were meant to be -- fulfilling their destinies as they discover who they are, what they believe in, and what and who they are willing to sacrifice to reach Number 10 Downing Street.
  They learn to balance their personal lives with their personal ambitions.
  The plot and acting are first rate.  The characters are intriguing.  I found some of the supporting characters more intriguing than the some of the four primary ones, but that only adds to the enjoyment.
  I found myself watching five hours straight without realizing it -- the story is that interesting.
  Even though my favorite did not win in the end that only made the story that much more intriguing.",1258761600,,860,4.775510204081633
3479441,4,B001B1Q2VI,"I have been a fan of the book since it first come out, having read it well over a dozen times.  I was eager to purchase the video adaptation once it came out on DVD.  Overall, I was pleased.
The miniseries is a fairly faithful adaptation of the book, with some scenes taken word for word from the printed page.  In other cases, changes are made to the storyline -- in some cases to advance the plot quickly, in others for no apparent reason.  However, the general plot of the book is retained.
My major quibble with the series is its casting.  Jeffery Archer's description of his major characters was detailed, and in most cases the actors do not resemble the characters in the book.  This was the major drawback for me, but I doubt it will matter to any but avid fans of the original.
All told, I recommend this miniseries.",1226534400,7,824,4.3881578947368425
3479442,5,B001B1Q2VI,"I have always been interested in the inner workings of the British form of government.  It seems to have many more facets of interaction than the American govermental system.  That is why I ordered ""First Among Equals"" and I was not disappointed with the content.  It was great!  The only problem I had was trying to understand the accents of a few of the characters.  Some meaning in some of the dialogue was obviously meant for people familiar with British History, so that I was not able to appreciate.
Overall, this is a a great series and one I would recommend.",1224547200,7,566,4.564356435643564
3479443,3,B001B1Q2VI,"It will take months of watching these Brits (mumbling in upper-class accents) to figure out what they're saying.  It's so disappointing to have no subtitle capability.  I/we are spoiled enough by this time to presume all movies in the English language, can in fact, be understood, by those of us who speak English (or maybe American?)  Have we missed something here?",1222041600,5,366,4.967213114754099
3479444,5,B001B1Q2VI,"New Scottish MP, Andrew Fraser, is joined by new MP, mid class lawyer Raymond Gould, on the Labor party side of government.  New MPs, wealthy Charles Seymour and his personal rival, Simon Kerslake, both sit on the Tory side.  It is British politics as its finest, or worst as the moment dictates.  It doesn't take a lot of former knowledge of how the government from the islands works to enjoy this 10-part series.

The story is more about how the 4 new MPs work and connive to further their ambition of becoming Prime Minister.  Only one will succeed.  Who?  How?  Well, I'll not tell who, but the how is through 20-plus years of political and personal manipulation of people and events.  Each man seems willing to use almost anything and anyone at times to get to the desired office.  It's not unlike American politics and the Presidential quest.

There is sex and prostitutes (models they call themselves) willing to bare all (and do onscreen) to help, and also to get what they want.  Wives are sacrificed, or used, or replaced, or relied on at times.  The debates and bickering that take place on the floor of legislature brings many a chuckle as each attempts to put the opposition in its place--but using the most delicate of language, in the stiff, polite, British fashion.

You'll find yourself booing one man, then applauding the same ambitious fellow in the next segment.  One thing for sure, you won't want to pause between the 10 episodes.

Money, sex, power, fighting, killing, mystery, drama, laughs, and London all packaged into this powerful Parliament political package.",1219017600,23,1588,4.825925925925926

8281308,5,B001B1Q2VI,"My very favorite British political drama.
Lord Archer was almost prophetic in a prediction/depiction of post Thatcher government, done while she was still in power.",1437782400,,164,5.6
8281309,5,B001B1Q2VI,"Even though it takes palce between the 1960s and 1980s, it is timless.  A great portrayl of Jeffrey Archer's political masterpiece.",1408838400,,131,5.238095238095238
8281310,5,B001B1Q2VI,A true insight into wheelings and dealings of Political Life! Some characters are lovable ~ some not so!  I lent my previous copy to someone and it was never returned. More than happy to purchase a replacement!,1382313600,,210,4.675675675675675
8281311,5,B001B1Q2VI,"Most entertainment films that deal with politics use it as a pretext for various kinds of sensationalism, usually violent.  So it's refreshing to watch one that's actually about trying to govern a nation.  First Among Equals does have its share of sex and violence, but that's because they are inescapable aspects of trying to govern a nation.  I just wish there were series like this about the government of the United States.  I don't know that much about British government, but this series makes it seem a lot more representative than the U.S. variety.  Perhaps that's because the U.S. is less and less a nation, and more and more a kind of transnational empire, more concerned with dealing with the other transnational empires-- China, Russia-- than with its own citizens.
This is a very good DVD set, with the nice pre-2008 soft plastic covers, although American language subtitles would have helped sometimes.  But the more you watch, the more you understand.",1374451200,,966,4.968944099378882
8281312,4,B001B1Q2VI,"I got this because I love the book by Jeffrey Archer and the actors, especially Tom Wilkinson.  It follows the book pretty closely - at least the British version.  I've heard that there's an American version of the book which is quite different (simplified for the American market).  It's well done - like the book, a touch slow at first, but better as it goes along.  One complaint is that they changed the orphanage scene and related child from the way portrayed in the book, which wasn't a positive for me.",1362787200,,509,4.56043956043956
8281313,4,B001B1Q2VI,"I did like this dvd series a lot . The only reason I gave it 4 stars was that the first two episodes of this series were  hard to get through, rather dull and boring, but after that it was quite interesting. I agree it was a bit hard to discern some of the dialogue, and I had to turn up the sound level and repeat some scenes to catch what was said.
Now when I look at the House of Commons and the Prime Minister's question periods with them I will have a more informed understanding of their political system.",1361232000,,511,4.0594059405940595
8281314,5,B001B1Q2VI,"When this aired on PBS, viewers were invited to vote on how it should end (apparently, several alternative endings were filmed).  It was wonderful to see it again.  Some fine acting here and a detailed window into how British politics works.  However, if you remember the series from viewing it on PBS (as I do), you will be surprised at the ending chosen for the DVD.",1356480000,,368,4.545454545454546
