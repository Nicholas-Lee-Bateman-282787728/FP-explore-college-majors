Right from the very first scene it is obvious that the Mihoshi Special is pure fun and games and not to be taken seriously. The story starts with Mihoshi's dream sequence in which she playfully corrupts several of our favorite childhood fairytales. Once awakened, Mihoshi starts telling the gang a story of one her favorite cases with the G.P. in which she cannot recall any of the particulars, so she substiutes the members of the Tenchi cast. As her story unfolds her substitutes bring out the absolute worst qualities of the gang: Ryoko becomes the demon-space pirate, Aeka is the arrogant Princess of Jurai Plutocrats, Tenchi is a brave but hapless police investigator (the Tenchi girls always like to remake him in their own image!), Washu becomes a real comic book type mad scientist, Sasami is an appretice detective (and eventually Pretty Sammy), and we have the introduction of Mihoshi's partner Kiyone. This story is great fun to watch, everyone seems to let go more than ever -  Ryoko is more devious, Aeka is more upset and violent, Tenchi is more naive, and Washu is madder than ever (which I really enjoyed because I like her mad scientist persona). Kiyone is much the same as she is in the TV series until the last scene when she becomes positively scary! Overall fast paced but great fun any anime fan would enjoy.",1003104000,2,1443,4.818548387096774

Ayeka was again, supposed to marry Tenchi, and that's the last thing most of us want. I didn't like the fact that Washu was the bad guy. I happened to have loved the episode but I just expected something new. Every TENCHI fan should try it. It's a cute episode and it's definatley worth watching. (At the end of the video you see a few seconds of the Tenchi TV music video in English but I personaly like the Japanese version a lot better ^_^)",994550400,,575,4.333333333333333
7864888,4,630417814X,"Some people don't know what to make of this one.  I view it as a segway episode between the Tenchi Muyo OVA and Tenchi Universe series.  It is in no way a conclusion to the OVA! ^_^
The episode is basically Mihoshi telling an amazing bedtime story staring/abusing the Tenchi Space Opera characters under her artistic licence.
Tenchi trivia buffs will point out that this is the episode that introduces Kiyone, Mihoshi's Galaxy Police partner.  Plus, it is the first instance of Pretty Sammy.  The Pretty Sammy character is extra complicated because 3 other instances of it exist:  She later re appeared in one of the fantasy within a fantasy episodes of the Tenchi Universe Series. Sammy later got her own OVA series, then a TV series re-telling of the OVA.
There is a really cute omake sequence at the end, and another cute fairy tale dream sequence at the beginning which are basically bonus mini stories unrelated to the main Mihoshi story (Lost count of all the Tenchi stories...).
Anyways, I liked it.  But, I'm a sucker for Pretty Sammy.
Must have for Pretty Sammy fan(atic)s.  Shoujo anime fans will love the omake.  Tenchi collectors will want this to round out their collection after OVA and Universe.  Probably not the best introduction to Tenchi though.",989452800,,1264,4.814814814814815
7864889,4,630417814X,"This does not tie into the Tenchi OVA at all. This is a special that was put in. It parodies Magical Girl Anime such as Sailor Moon. It is very good, but only get it if you are a serious anime fan. I was dissapointed that this was not in the Tenchi Muyo OVA DVD box set. If you like Tenchi and want a break from the OVA then get this.",989280000,,334,3.7183098591549295
7864890,3,630417814X,"I hate to say this... but this video is perhaps the ONLY Tenchi Muyo production that I was disappointed by.  If you expect the same consistent and well-rendered animation, you'll get it for the most part.  But here's  what you won't get:  The same dubbed voices for many of the characters-  they're gone.  Some really whacky and unsightly animation flaws- there are  a few that took me aback.  And lastly, a storyline is missing.  I'm a HUGE  Tenchi fan, so I still deem it watchable, but don't compare it to the rest  of the series.  Try ""Tenchi Muyo! in Love"".",922838400,2,562,4.51
