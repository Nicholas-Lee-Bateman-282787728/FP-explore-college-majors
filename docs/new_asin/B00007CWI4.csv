1806000,5,B00007CWI4,"This was a fun film to watch. Not great acting, but good story and good characters. Worth watching at least once.",1264809600,,113,4.428571428571429
1806001,3,B00007CWI4,This is not a good film but the actors are fairly hot. I would recommend it only if you're needing some man-candy.,1243728000,,114,4.2272727272727275
1806002,1,B00007CWI4,"I can't believe this was made in 2002. It seemed more like 1992 with the friend's stone aged computer and the roommate going ""What's a screen name?"" He was like ""Chat room? What's that?"" ""Internet? Never heard of it. Is it new?"" I mean COME ON!!!

This movie was a lesson on how to use the internet by someone who has never used it before. This movie is just stupid.",1196899200,3,366,4.228571428571429
1806003,4,B00007CWI4,I think it's great that many studios are supporting the gay community by releasing independant titles.  I think this movie is super sexy and fun!,1158192000,3,145,4.8
1806004,1,B00007CWI4,"""Breaking the Cycle,"" is poor, simulated, soft-core gay male erotica shot on video (not film). It attempts to be a romantic comedy with the ""message"" that surfing the internet for casual sex is no way to find a long-term relationship, hardly an earth-shattering piece of information. The guys are pleasant-looking but the acting is laughable. 10% Productions uses straight actors playing gay; nothing unusual there, but interviews with two of them reveal that they were very uncomfortable doing so. It is obvious that no one received much coaching because the simulated erotic scenes are clumsy and the guys are apparently nervous even about being seen kissing; as a result, they look like they have never kissed anyone, male or female. Everything about their participation is a real turn-off. Irresponsibly, nowhere is there a hint of safe-sex practices. The two principals are supposed to be roommates who are actors having trouble finding work. That premise is the only candid aspect of this mess: who would hire such talentless hacks? This item is a complete failure, falling flatter than a pancake either as comedy or erotica.",1153958400,5,1131,5.1521739130434785
1806005,3,B00007CWI4,The story is nice but the acting...well let's just say 5 years old can do better than that. and again I blame it all at the director...did you take some acting class before ?? or may be he didn't pass cinematography school.,1131408000,3,223,4.333333333333333
1806006,3,B00007CWI4,"If anything this movie is worth it simply for looking at the good looking guys.  The story line is a little preachy but still entertaining. ""Chad"" is particularly attractive and has a classical theatrical quality.",1045612800,17,213,5.085714285714285
1806007,4,B00007CWI4,Since this movie was filming in New York and I LOVE NEW YORK CITY I have to already give it credit.  The story revolves around a guy who cruises chatrooms and how he isn't satisfied... His roommate a cutie blonde thinks hooking up should be the traditional way.  It's not hard to figure out what happens but ya know sometimes I like knowing what happens - HELLO any Julia Roberts Movie... also MAKE sure you check out the commerical the company 10percent productions put in the extras menu - it's the hottest and gayest commerical i've ever seen - think calvin klein meets queer as folk!  I'd recommend this charming and sexy story.,1041984000,15,632,4.575221238938053
1806008,2,B00007CWI4,"Two good-looking gay guys are roommates in Manhattan.  One likes to arrange dates in internet chatrooms; the other wants to get to know the other person first.  The former gets ""dates"" - in a back area of an adult theater and with an 18-year-old nominally straight guy who plays baseball; the latter pines away at home.  The roommates claim not to like each other.  An underutilized, cute friend of the reserved roommate shows him how to get on the internet.  Both roommates end up in the same chatroom.  Try guessing the rest.
To its credit, this very earnest film flies through its motions in about 65 minutes.  Snickers help one get past the wooden script and acting lulls.  There are lots of skin shots, and the casting is attractive, though some of the sex scenes may not convince.  (Maybe the two interviews in the extras section help explain that - both actors say they are straight and have never done this sort of thing before.)
While the movie clearly wants to show why getting to know someone before sex is better than a quickie through the internet, the roommate who holds back is not shown succeeding at getting much more than computer advice from a friend, who is told in turn that friendship is not enough to get any sex.  The payoff for the slow-going roommate seems no better than the web-shopper's.  It is not even clear the roommates will continue to tolerate each other.
Worthy, but trite...",1041465600,33,1411,4.649193548387097
1806028,3,B00007CWI4,"For a low budget, gay movie this was ok.  It had a decent story line to it, but the actors were not very believable.",1378771200,,116,3.8333333333333335
1806029,3,B00007CWI4,"The acting was adequate in this film. The story was predictable at times. The main actors were easy on the eyes. Mostly, I'm impressed that this film challenges the viewer to desire relationships and not just meaningless hookups.",1372636800,,229,5.052631578947368
1806030,3,B00007CWI4,It is an ok movie not the best acting but not a b ad story line..very hot guys..worth the 1.99 on stream.,1370563200,,105,3.8181818181818183
1806031,1,B00007CWI4,"I was going to watch this movie, but I read the reviews and it was mentioned that both actors claim they are str8!  Why oh, why do these actors who play gay characters always claim they are str8?- West Hollywood had zillions of gay aspiring actors looking for a chance to be in film and yet (if we are  to believe them) only str8 guys seem to get these roles! IMO, I don't believe them (being str8!), but, then again, who am I?",1366070400,,427,4.132530120481928
1806032,4,B00007CWI4,the story could be possible and is mildly entertaining and again I find it likely and realistic and has a happy ending.,1358294400,,119,4.454545454545454
1806033,4,B00007CWI4,pretty good story line and having the characters thoughts known to us helps make the plot believable.  The guys are hot too and it is cool how they finally hook up.,1340928000,,164,4.290322580645161
1806034,2,B00007CWI4,Meeting your roommate on Internet Dating Site and fall in love without knowing the guy on the other end of the chat is your roommate.  Predictable.,1339200000,,147,4.653846153846154
1806035,3,B00007CWI4,"This is a really cute movie!  After reading the negative reviews, I almost didn't watch it.  I'm glad I did!  The two lead characters are adorable, especially Carlos J. Da Silva, as the internet hook-up gay guy finding himself in NYC.  His acting was natural and really good - his roommate, while a weaker actor, is still an adorable and likeable character and the story line is one most gay men can relate to.  There is plenty of eye candy with many cute boys and simulated sex scenes...however, it really is a story with a heart, and a realistic portrayal of contemporary gay life.  Yes, it is a low budget movie but, all things considered, a suprisingly good movie!  A very pleasant way to spend an hour or two!",1331942400,2,714,4.488372093023256
1806036,1,B00007CWI4,"well 1st $1.99 for a movie that is only 1 hr. long is a rip in it self,but then you have the extremely BAD acting .
and the 1st sex scene if ya want to call it that was one of the guys at a male theatre hooking up w/sunshine from Queer as Folk. And they have sex right by the doors to the auditorium w/o anyone wanting to join in or fondling themselves, I mean come on. Then the computers they were using were from the early 90's .

7975153,1,B00007CWI4,"Take a quick glance at the promo/hype for this flick:

""Take a trip through . . . romantic and crazy Times Square.""

Then run as fast you can in the opposite direction.

A half dozen years before Angelina Jolie was born, there was a movie about a crazy Times Square romance between Angelina dad's when he was still way-cute (like a young Brad Pitt--THAT cute) and Dustin Hoffman was still in his post-Graduate period before he got in touch with his inner middle-aged trannie (even though the Academy burned him for the Oscar on that role, too).  That ""crazy"" love story was called ""Midnight Cowboy,"" but it had nothing to do with Brokeback Ranch, except that like all Hollywood movies about deviants, naturally one of them had to die by the end.

Quite frankly, I have no idea if anybody dies in Breaking the Cycle.  I hope not.  It would be really nice if all the homosexuals were allowed to live, for a change.  It was only the mere thought of a Times Square romance that made my skin crawl and my gut threaten to evict the Double Venti Extra Shot, Extra Hot Latte that was supposed to be pumping into the express lane of my blood stream. No doubt there are less romantic spots on earth (Guantanamo Bay comes to mind), but not many.  That was the whole point of Midnight Cowboy, that two lost souls were able to connect in one of the more soulless places imaginable.

This flick, however, looks more like somebody trying too hard to sell us on how much fun might be found in the tourist trap vortex of the universe.  Whoever wrote that piss-poor ad copy has never actually been anywhere nearer to Times Square than a T.V. set on New Year's Eve.  More than likely, he/she/it is furthermore that breed of bottomfeeder publicist who would never waste time watching the movie when they could be doing cheap Mexican coke in some bar in Van Nuys.  What? You think they have nothing better to do than watch stinkers like this?  Geddouttahere, already!",1417996800,,1946,4.538681948424069
