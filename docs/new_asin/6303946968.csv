7856962,3,6303946968,"Artie Logan is a degenerative young man, bordering between teen and young adult who's just been let out of jail. Artie has a record of being kicked out of school and setting things on fire. His latest crime has landed him behind bars but he's luckily bailed out by his father, who's a well-known judge for the town. He's given one last chance to finish college, this time attending Fairfield College as a new student, where he immediately develops a crush on the popular and sweeter than apple pie, Tally Fuller.

He spends his first days on campus trying to win her over and manages to succeed in that. But the romance is short lived when Tally is killed one night after mysteriously being burned alive and the blame falls squarely on Artie's shoulders. Sent in to investigate is detective PJ Decker, a wiseguy but plausible cop. Feeling that there's some slight truth to Artie's alibi, he gives him 24 hours to find enough evidence to prove himself innocent. As Artie digs deeper into tracking down the killer, he uncovers a lot of dark truths that put him in the crosshairs of being the killer's next victim

Overall: Depending on what your idea of a teen thriller is, this may or may not suit your standards. All-American Murder right off the bat is a very stereotypical 90s film; from the clothes to the characters to the music. The first 20-30 minutes of the film are kind of slow and cliche, but after that, everything starts to pick up. This movie really just seems like an extended version of CSI or Law & Order (even though both of those shows didn't come out for another 8-9 years after this) as most of the film is investigating, investigating, investigating with maybe 3-5 minute kill scene intervals. Most of the kills in this movie are nothing to really hit home about. Probably the goriest one is the final one which involves a grenade but I'll leave it at that. The acting is moderate but for a direct to video film with a budget of about a few hundred dollars, that's about all you can expect, so it's passable. I admire the interesting plot All-American Murder presents however and the twists and turns it brings along the way. Overall, All-American Murder is by no means a masterpiece and not all that great but it's worth a watch when you have some downtime",1467504000,,2278,4.580882352941177
7856963,5,6303946968,"I sought this movie out because I'm finishing up my degree in criminal justice, about to start police training, and I wanted to know what to expect.
I was not disappointed. I learned an irreplaceable amount of helpful tips and real-world law enforcement tricks from Christopher Walken's Detective P.J. Decker. Even from his introductory scene, I knew I had to brandish a pad of paper to take notes. Firstly, I was taught that in an armed hostage situation, forget all of that ""listening"" and ""earning their trust"" nonsense. The best course of action is to insult them, claim you're sleeping with their spouse, then accuse them of sexual impotence. This works wonders and will send the hostage taker charging out of the building, given you ample time to shoot them in slow motion. The main lesson I was taught though is about how to solve a murder case. Anyone who tells you it involves lots of hard work, depositions, analysis of evidence, etc., is wrong. The best way to handle a murder case is to allow the primary suspect 24 hours to find the real killer. After all, they said they didn't do it. Why would they lie? You still have to check up on them occasionally to update them on how much time they have left and to tell them personal stories about your family, but otherwise you should be pretty hands-off. Another helpful tip I learned near the end of the film is that if you find someone else dead and you suspect that your first suspect did it while they were supposed to be investigating, bring them in! (Because hey, fool me once.) But, don't handcuff them or search their personal belongings. Just put them in the back of your car. They deserve a chance to escape.
In conclusion, being a detective is super easy and I'm excited for the rest of my life.
Also, it was crazy how the pretty blonde girl who everybody thought died first by fire... She was the killer the whole time?! Wow. Thank god I let the murder suspect take care of this, because I would've not been able to figure that one out.",1458950400,3,2006,4.528925619834711

7856968,1,6303946968,"Buried underneath an avalanche of awfulness in this thriller directed by Happy Day's Potsie Anson Williams are good actors like Christopher Walken and Joanna Cassidy. That Walken is sleepwalking is preferable to when he goes in the other direction and he gets to tell the same anecdote twice, but poor Cassidy is lumbered with an insulting Mrs Robinson wife of a college dean role reduced to having an affair with perenial teen Charlie Schlatter. Schlatter is perhaps the most offensive element of this film, his pretty boy appeal more annoying than charming, totally unbelievable as sexually active and worse a rebel! Things aren't helped by screenwriter Barry Sandler supplying him with smarmy wisecracks, as if he was doing bad Neil Simon. Some of Sandler's gems - ""My father is a judge and very objective. He objects to everything I do"", ""I like going to cemetaries. They remind me I'm alive"", and Cassidy gets ""The state I was married in was depression"". This banter is paced by Williams, well, like TV without the laughtrack, until Josie Bisset as a girl Schlattter is interested in becomes the victim in a series of murders at the college. At least this thankfully ends the romance overplayed with songs on the soundtrack. Schlatter's previous arson connection (symbolised by a snake fetsh. Freud, are you paying attention?) is soon abandoned when different modes of killing are used, and we get stuck in the mentality of police investigation headed by Walken where Schlatter has to prove his innocence in 24 hours. The fact that Schlatter is free implies that his innocence is believed, something the audience doesn't doubt thanks to Williams' stalker POV during Bisset's death, and also is evidence of Walken's teams inaction since Schlatter is left to solve the crimes. If all this isn't stupid enough, Williams adds tilted camera angles, black and white flashbacks which ironically are more flattering to pre-Melrose Place Bissett, a mute groundskeeper out of Universal circa 1932, and incriminating polaroids where the photographer is unknown. As a friend of Bisset, Amy Davis has a likeable presence and certainly more acting ability than Schlatter, even if she is lumbered with the role of a low self-esteemer and given lines like ""My cousin Roz has a lizard. I call it the lizard of Roz"".",996278400,7,2303,5.031413612565445
