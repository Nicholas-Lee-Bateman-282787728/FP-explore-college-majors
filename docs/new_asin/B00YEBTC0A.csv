7213315,4,B00YEBTC0A,"This was a well done production of WWII from several viewpoints. There is the Norwegian viewpoint. That country is occupied by the Nazis. It is supplying the heavy water that is needed by physicists to produce an atomic bomb. There is the German viewpoint, which is  Heisenberg trying to build the bomb in Germany despite constant hurdles thrown in his way by the Nazis.  This was the race to produce the atomic bomb, which the Germans ultimately lost.

There is resistance to the Nazis getting the heavy water from Norway yet also the building of a huge company which did that and would diversify and prosper after the War. For those into action adventure, there are some thrilling chase scenes done on skis of Nazis pursuing Norwegians who are trying to sabotage the heavy water efforts.

However, I think the makers of this series pursued the weaker story. The strong story was Heisenberg's, not the Norwegians. There was a terrific actor playing him too and he's not even shown on the box. Here was a man who primarily existed in his head with calculations. He was not a political person. He was entirely caught up in his lab trying to produce the bomb and tuned out everything else as much as he could. The Nazis and he butted heads consistently. The fascinating reason was that he wanted to produce the bomb whereas they were overly concerned that only Aryans make the bomb. He would protest, saying that Einstein and Oppenheimer were Jews and were making great headway in America and then he rattled off other Jewish scientists in England and elsewhere. He was told never to bring up that subject again. The Nazis then proceeded to saddle him with all inferior scientists but who fit their definition of being Aryans. The Nazis are always unhappy with him too because he has no goal other than producing the bomb to win the war. Hitler, the Jewish purging, and so forth barely cross his mind. I am sure this is a very realistic portrait of how the genius scientist functions.

So yes, some Norwegians slowed Heisenberg down by their sabotage efforts with heavy water. But I think the people who really sabotaged Heisenberg every step of the way were the Nazis themselves. Because of all of their mad ideas, they had him building the bomb on his own. As we know, it was a huge collaborative effort of brilliant scientists at Los Alamos who ultimately succeeded. They were able to pick the best scientists for the job without any other concerns.

I personally would have liked to explore Heisenberg's entire journey on trying to build the bomb, while being thwarted by the Nazis at every turn, rather than get the small pieces of his story that I got here.",1448668800,8,2661,4.687366167023555
8718219,4,B00YEBTC0A,"A great mini-series on some of the history behind the Nazi race to develop a nuclear bomb toward the end of WW2. Great acting and epic scenes in this six-part series. The downside is that this DVD set is only available in PAL format and won't play in most US DVD players.. The language is native to those speaking it in most scenes, but subtitles handle the translation from Scandinavian and German to English where applicable.",1472083200,2,427,4.631578947368421

8718221,3,B00YEBTC0A,"I have several brief comments. First; this looks like a remake of ""Heroes of Telemark"" which starred Kirk Douglas. I was surprised no one mentioned that in the reviews.
Also: distorted historical drama is always problematic. Should one produce history then do so. If producing drama, then perhaps forget the history and just tell a nice story. The German deuterium program was not directed toward a bomb, it was directed towards power production, ie., electricity. Perhaps the story lacks sufficient attraction to a modern audience without something more dramatic than ""revolutionary power plant theories falling into German hands!"" And so, The German Bomb becomes the plot.
Ironically, nations do fight wars over economic issues, including power production, and to some extent power production is a strategic priority.",1466726400,,819,5.456692913385827
8718222,4,B00YEBTC0A,"The one that plays in DVD Region 1 is titled the ""Heavy Water War"",
The one that plays in DVD Region 2 is titled the ""The Saboteurs"".
No dubbed english, and if you select english subtitles,
you won't get them for the parts where english is spoken,
no matter how peculiar an accent is being spoken in a noisy scene.
But it's a good story!",1465171200,,337,4.2

8718224,5,B00YEBTC0A,"Beautiful, Thoughtful and Realistic - far different than any Hollywood 'War Movie'. It made me think what it must have been like for my Dad when he went off to the Pacific Theater, and Mom (his girlfriend then) waiting for him in small town Illinois USA. Superbly acted by the entire cast. Subtitles (German, Norwegian) for English speakers.",1456185600,3,341,4.896551724137931
8718225,5,B00YEBTC0A,"This is a very good portrayal of a fairly unknown event from WW2. (unless you take a special interest in war events or ww2 in particular). I found the pacing to be really good. It is not non-stop action but pretty of tension throughout. The cinematography, direction and soundtrack is superb. I found the actors to be overall very good as well. This includes most of the Norwegian cast, the Danish lady, the British cast and the German cast. I enjoyed the British portion a lot, with the chemistry between the Norwegian team-leader and the British office lady - though this is entirely fictional, as there was never any reports of any British female officers working on this operation. There are also some liberties taken to improve the tension throughout the series, and in some cases I think the creators had to make some educated guesses, as not everything from this period was fully documented. Still, it gets the important stuff right, and done very well, so I highly recommend it. I was just flicking through N.e.t.flix and saw it was highly rated and figured I'd give it a try. I was fully expecting to stop half-way through the first episode (I do this a lot, as I am quite picky), but found myself captivated from the first few minutes.",1455494400,7,1245,4.663636363636364
8718226,5,B00YEBTC0A,"This 4 hr miniseries is an elaboration on the 1966 classic war film ""The Heroes of Telemark"" starring Kirk Douglas. It takes a much deeper look at the scientists who developed the 'heavy water' required to build an atom bomb which Hitler was seeking to attain before the Allies could/did. Its in Norwegian, English, and German with subtitles throughout. Their is a lot more character development here than in the 1966 movie and the production values are superb. What comes through so strongly watching this film is just how incredibly brave & heroic the folks who thwarted Hitler's plans were. This is a very entertaining, tense, nerve wracking show that is one of the best War films I've seen in a long time. If you liked the original film--you'll love this 'new version' some 50 yrs after the original.",1455321600,6,804,4.7913669064748206

8718228,5,B00YEBTC0A,Agree with the above review.  I'm adding a star because I wasn't expecting to like the series as much as I did.  This is a perfect binge-watching show.,1454630400,,151,4.357142857142857
