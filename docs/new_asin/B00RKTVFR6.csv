8695473,5,B00RKTVFR6,"Excellent drama! I loved the characters and the story was very intriguing. Kim So-eun as Nam Da-jung, Lee Sang-yoon as Ha Woo-jin, and
Shin Sung-rok as Kang Do-young (the villain) have out done themselves.
Nam Da-jung is an innocent college student who passes a hidden camera audition and is invited to join the reality show Liar Game, a psychological survival game wherein participants trick each other and the one who ultimately succeeds wins the prize money of 10 billion (US$9.3 million). Tempted with the chance to pay off her debts, Da-jung joins the game and gets conned out of the initial money given to her. In desperation, she asks genius ex-con swindler and former psychology professor Ha Woo-jin to help her win the game.",1449187200,,733,4.919354838709677
