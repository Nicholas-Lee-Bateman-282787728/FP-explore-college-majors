Funny thing is that the other Solos DVDs don't have this which made me wonder if they used a different company to press Rubalcaba's DVD. However, my DVD player played it find. I was scared because I read the review available here.",1313020800,,324,4.508474576271187
8385652,1,B0030BYWEG,"I tried four diffrent copies of this DVD, none of them played properly. They all skiped, froze, and wouldn't play certain chapters. I tried playing all of them in three diffrent players including a mac book pro. Where is the quality control? It's 2010, and not hard to make a DVD.",1272758400,5,280,4.509803921568627
