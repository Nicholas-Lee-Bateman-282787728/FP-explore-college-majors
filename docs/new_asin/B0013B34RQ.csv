3102693,4,B0013B34RQ,"Much Ado About Nothing(1987)is another in the CBC's TV productions of some of Shakespeare's plays filmed at Stratford,Ontario. This one features some outstanding Canadian actors such as the late William Hutt as Leonato,Brent Carver as Don John,Richard Monette as Benedick, and American Tandy Cronyn as Beatrice.
The plot has two sets of loves:one instantaneous,and the other prodded. Three military men arrive at Leonato's home to visit. One of them,Claudio,falls instantly in love with Leonato's daughter,Hero. The brother to one of the officers is a civilian,Don John,and he also is staying there. But he has a melancholy disposition and tries to break up,out of spite and distraction,Claudio's impending marriage to Hero. This he does and Hero's reputation is temporarily sullied. In the meantime both steadfast bachelor and bacherlorette,Benedick and Beatrice(Leonato's niece),who historically have traded verbal barbs and sarcasm with each other for years,are both tricked into thinking that one is madly in love with the other.
Hero's father decides,with some direction from the minister who was there to perform the ceremony,that Hero should appear dead,and believes that Hero has been wronged and justice will prevail in the end. Don John's underlings,who helped undertake the deception which led to the stoppage of Claudio and Hero's wedding,are found out and they confess. Don John flees. In the end Claudio and Hero are wed,along with Beatrice and Benedick.
This version of Ado is set about 200-250 years into the future from Shakespearean times and in England,not Italy,which I deduct marks for. However,unlike many of the other CBC productions,this one has no live audience,so the acting is staged for the camera. And it actually makes for a well paced and well understood production,unlike another CBC production on DVD,The Taming of the Shrew. Monette's elocution is wonderful and all the actors are heard and seen to their best advantage here.
All in all a recommended version of Shakey's Much Ado About Nothing.",1349049600,5,2028,5.420886075949367

A most enjoyable romp by a splendid cast.",1390262400,,153,5.16
3102705,5,B0013B34RQ,"This is a terrifically well-acted and well-spoken production of Shakespeare's comedy.  Impressive clarity of the acting and staging is present from start to finish as is a buoyant energy in the speaking. This production communicates every instant of the almost 3 hours running time and it does much credit to the entire Globe project, including the Globe On Screen series of cinema showings and dvd releases. There's not a weak link in the cast, which is to be highly commended, along with stage director Jeremy Herrin and designer Mike Britton, for a spirited, greatly enjoyable production. Other reviewers have quite rightly commented favorably on the Beatrice of Eve Best, the Benedick of Charles Edwards, the Claudio of Philip Cumbus, as well as on the Leonato (Joseph Marcell), the Don Pedro (Ewan Stewart), and the Dogberry (Paul Hunter).  To their number I would add the Hero of Ony Uhiara and the Don John of Matthew Pidgeon.  Ms. Uhiara is heartbreaking in the pivotal scene of the wedding that goes so terribly awry, and Mr. Pidgeon manages to give us an understandable characterization of this champion 'black sheep of the family', this pathological malcontent and miscreant, the one who causes such havoc and heartbreak -- it's quite an achievement.

A couple of thoughts about the Dogberry, who may not be to everyone's taste, judging by some of the reviews posted here.  In Shakespeare's time the role would have been played by the company clown or most prominent comedic actor in the troupe.  That actor (who we know was Will Kemp from the actor's name being substituted for the character's at places in early printings of the play) would have had his signature repertoire of comedic business and, no doubt, an appreciative following among the patrons of the original Globe (particularly the groundlings!).  To his considerable credit, the actor in this production, Paul Hunter, goes far out on a limb in creating his version of the comedic turn.  It's not something we usually see much of anymore (at  least not since the days of Jackie Gleason, Red Skelton, the Three Stooges, and their brethren) but, one could argue, that in its way, this actor's approach is of a piece with doing the play on an open stage, with groundlings, and a whole array of other features approximating the original Globe.  It's important, I think, to remember that this performance was calibrated to an open stage in a theater accommodating about 1500 people (the original Globe probably accommodated closer to 3000, according to scholars of the Elizabethan theater).  Capturing this performance on video necessarily objectifies it by putting a frame around it and in some viewing situations, such as a television screen or a computer screen, that frame can be quite small indeed and maybe not the ideal viewing mode for a performance so broadly conceived for an open-air stage.  At any rate, the audience at the taped performance were greatly entertained by Mr. Hunter's performance, judging by the reactions captured in the video -- reactions which did not lessen as the evening went along, but grew even more appreciative. To each his own, of course, but for me, the actor's approach here gave even more to think about.

Indeed, one of the most winning things about this video release is the strong sense of audience appreciation and involvement in the course of the performance.  Even in the rain -- which does not detract one whit from the goings on onstage -- their involvement only grew.  One of the greatest joys of this release is to see the audience, some of them standing, some of them in the rain, radiant faces upturned toward the actors on the stage.

3102706,5,B0013B34RQ,"""Much Ado About Nothing"" works because of the attractive, vibrant, intelligent lovers at its center. Benedick and Beatrice are wickedly funny (and vain about it), self-involved yet deeply generous, and each is fascinated by (if intensely ambivalent about) the other. They engage in relentless verbal fencing--sometimes innocuous, sometimes wounding--and when they are ""tricked"" into falling in love, the audience sees that they are the last to learn what everyone else has long known.

Productions of ""Much Ado"" stand or fall on the performances of these two, and the Globe Theatre was immensely fortunate to have Eve Best and Charles Edwards to bring them to life. Edwards plays a Benedick struggling out of a prolonged adolescence into the commitments of adulthood, swinging between confident bluster and lost, boyish perplexity, while Best plays Beatrice as surprisingly rough-hewn, combative, and wounded. But with all her aggressiveness, she is also very, very funny, as is Edwards. Despite their wit, they both spend much of the play comically at sea, especially with respect to each other. They also create between them such a palpable attraction that their looooong-delayed kiss at the end raises a cheer from the audience.

Other noteworthy performances are Joseph Marcell as Leonato and Philip Cumbus as Claudio. These can be thankless roles, but Marcell is both kindly and shrewd and Leonato, while Cumbus invests Claudio with sufficient passion, naivety, and suffering in the play's darker stretches that we're willing to forgive his horrific treatment of Hero, the sweet young thing he adores.

The audience and performers at the Globe Theatre are fully visible to each other, encouraging a broad, cabaret style of comedy and a great deal of interaction. In this production, the audience becomes virtually another character, cheering the lovers and booing the villains, while the actors flirt with them shamelessly. On the night this was filmed, furthermore, rain fell throughout most of the performance, while the penny groundlings toughed it out bravely in their different colored rain gear--something that surely happened often in Shakespeare's time. It didn't, though, seem to dampen their spirits any. They came to have fun--which they did, rain, mud, and all.",1377388800,12,2278,5.393258426966292
3102707,5,B0013B34RQ,"I have to admit, this is not my favorite production of Much Ado. But, if at the end of this performance, if you don't feel happy for Benedict and Beatrice, you are a plain villain! and have no soul. That two people could find each other such as this, and fall in love, gives hope for the world.

At the risk of repeating myself (see my other reviews), if you haven't seen a Globe Theatre production of Shakespeare, you haven't seen Shakespeare. Seeing Shakespeare performed in his native environment (an outdoor circular theatre where the ""groundlings"" are right up to the stage), you realize why Shakespeare wrote some of the things he wrote or staged the action the way he did. In this production, about 20 minutes from the end, the way Benedict interacts with an audience member is hilarious.

That being said, the director chose to stage this adaption as more leaning towards farce. Claudio, at the beginning of the play, acts like an idiot, and Don John hams up his villainy for comedic effect. Okay, I guess, but I think Kenneth Branagh's version is probably closer to what Shakespeare intended. The scene in that version where Beatrice asks Benedict to kill Claudio is harrowing (the hairs on my neck stand up every time I watch it). In this version, you never really worry about anything that will happen; it's all comedy and farce and you know it will be fine. Again, nothing necessary wrong with that, but I prefer my Shakespeare less modern (""comedy"" in modern usage means laughs; ""comedy"" in Shakespeare's time just meant everything works out in the end).

The advantage this performance has over others (including Branagh's version) is that the text is not abridged. They perform every line of the original play; the only alteration I caught was they replaced the ""boy"" that gets Benedict's book with Margaret (I guess to save an actor). It's nice to see the play in its entirety (the only other way is to watch the BBC version).

So if you like Shakespeare, this is must-see viewing. And please check out the other Globe productions on DVD, especially Henry IV Part 1.",1375920000,3,2082,4.7272727272727275
3102708,5,B0013B34RQ,"I have seen three different Shakespeare plays at the Globe theater in London, and they have all been a fantastic experience.  Two of them (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Othello-Shakespeare-s-Globe-Theatre-Production/dp/B0012EM5CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Othello (Shakespeare's Globe Theatre Production)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-VIII-Shakespeare-s-Globe-Theatre/dp/B007LNBSU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry VIII: Shakespeare's Globe Theatre</a>) have been released as dvd's  But, I haven't watched them yet.  This is the first dvd from the Globe that I have watched- and loved it.

The reconstructed Globe theater is essentially an exact reproduction of a theatre (almost on this exact spot) where many of Shakespeare's plays were actually performed.  It is open air, quite ""natural"", with seats and standing room (groundlings) just as in 1600.  In fact, to me, with only a slight exaggeration, it is very much like being back 400 years and watching one of his plays.  Certainly the productions are meant to be reasonably authentic to those times.  And what great fun it is.

""Much Ado"" is my favorite comedy, with great verbal wit between Beatrice and Benedict, and a plot and dialogue that it quite easy to follow. Here, Charles Edwards as Benedict really shines for me with a terrific performance.  All of the actors were very good, but I thought he was excellent (as did my wife).

The staging was quite effective and funny, and it was well filmed.

The closeness of the audience (the groundlings) and being able to see audience members in the background in some shots, makes this whole performance really come alive.  And, it even rained (drizzled) throughout much of the performance which heightened the reality of it even more.  Terrific.

Let me say that if you get to London (and you should- a great city) you must go to the Globe theater to see a Shakespeare play.  The regular season is May through early October.  I understand that they are building a small indoor theater (about 300 seats) with candle lighting(!!) which is due to open in 2014 to put on plays all year.  Don't miss it.  But, these dvd's are a very good substitute.",1375228800,,2257,5.663690476190476
3102709,5,B0013B34RQ,"The Kenneth Branagh film is a fun romance, but this production is far superior. Filmed in performance at The Globe, the production is faithful to the text. The acting is wonderful, especially from the actors portraying Beatrice and Benedick.",1369180800,6,241,5.205128205128205

3102711,4,B0013B34RQ,"I think it is no accident that two out of the three five star reviews were written by people who saw a performance by this troupe live, on stage, as this production demonstrates the strengths of a live performance, especially in an Elizabethan theatre, and the drawbacks of filming such a performance.

The recreation of the Globe was a delight. I confess I suspect the theatre is substantially larger than the original, although the shape is the same. The stage puts the actors very close to the audience. At a few points, the actors interact with audience members. Unfortunately, that means there is no way to have cameras come up to film the actors with close-ups. All the filming was probably done from three stationary cameras in the center, and to the left and right of the stage, at the back of the ""groundlings"" (See Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act III, Scene II: ""...to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise."") I was even skeptical of whether the actors wore microphones, or whether all the dialogue was picked up by small microphones around the stage. For a person with normal hearing, with normal or slightly higher volume than normal, all the dialogue could be heard plainly; however, I can appreciate the problem of a person with impaired hearing. The lighting and the sound from the group of instruments on the Mezzanine level above the stage was a bit weak.

The acting by the principals, Charles Edwards as Benedick and Eve Best as Beatrice, was superior. The acting by most others was good by Shakespearean standards. I agree with the reviewer who was not happy with the characterization of Dogberry and his scenes. I looked at Dogberry's dialogue in the play, and I see very little which would support the kind of business and conceits played by this Dogberry.

In many ways, this production suffers in comparison to Kenneth Branagh's production with an all star cast. Even Dogberry is played by a major name actor, Michael Keaton and lesser roles are played by actors in the front rank of Shakespearean acting such as Richard Briars and Brian Blessed. Keaton's interpretation of Dogberry is far more imaginative than the one in this production, although it seems a fair number of Dogberry's scenes were cut by Branagh. But the comparison is unfair, as they are virtually two different media, which we happen to see on film. This production has the virtue of being complete, as Shakespeare wrote it, not twisted about here and there, as when Branagh puts Balthazar's ""hey, nonny, nonny"" song in Beatrice's mouth.

Get this version if you want true Shakespeare. Get Branagh's version if you want a glittering interpretation.",1367107200,5,2715,4.87012987012987
3102712,5,B0013B34RQ,"This is Shakespeare done very right.  This production ran in London at the same time as the more famous David Tennant Catherine Tate modern version, and this is every bit as good - it's funny, romantic, well acted...",1365811200,,216,4.684210526315789
3102713,3,B0013B34RQ,"This Globe production is not, in our family's opinion, up to the standards of the other Globe comedies, especially the wonderful Love's Labours' Lost.  Among the worst Dogberry-Verges night watch subplots we've ever seen.  Bad casting of Dogberry.  It must be a British thing if they like it.  The other actors' performances were good.
We watched the Kultur edition, not knowing that there was available a superior Opus Arte edition.  Opus Arte's Globe DVD's include subtitles and they add enormously to the understanding and pleasure of watching the plays.  This Kultur one does not.  I wear hearing aids and have a TV with good speakers and have seen the play several times and still could not understand many of the lines.  Even two other members of my family had difficulty understanding at times.

Productions of ""Much Ado"" stand or fall on the performances of these two, and the Globe Theatre was immensely fortunate to have Eve Best and Charles Edwards to bring them to life. Edwards plays a Benedick struggling out of a prolonged adolescence into the commitments of adulthood, swinging between confident bluster and lost, boyish perplexity, while Best plays Beatrice as surprisingly rough-hewn, combative, and wounded. But with all her aggressiveness, she is also very, very funny, as is Edwards. Despite their wit, they both spend much of the play comically at sea, especially with respect to each other. They also create between them such a palpable attraction that their looooong-delayed kiss at the end raises a cheer from the audience.

Other noteworthy performances are Joseph Marcell as Leonato and Philip Cumbus as Claudio. These can be thankless roles, but Marcell is both kindly and shrewd and Leonato, while Cumbus invests Claudio with sufficient passion, naivety, and suffering in the play's darker stretches that we're willing to forgive his horrific treatment of Hero, the sweet young thing he adores.

The audience and performers at the Globe Theatre are fully visible to each other, encouraging a broad, cabaret style of comedy and a great deal of interaction. In this production, the audience becomes virtually another character, cheering the lovers and booing the villains, while the actors flirt with them shamelessly. On the night this was filmed, furthermore, rain fell throughout most of the performance, while the penny groundlings toughed it out bravely in their different colored rain gear--something that surely happened often in Shakespeare's time. It didn't, though, seem to dampen their spirits any. They came to have fun--which they did, rain, mud, and all.",1377388800,12,2278,5.393258426966292
3337204,5,B0013B34RQ,"I have to admit, this is not my favorite production of Much Ado. But, if at the end of this performance, if you don't feel happy for Benedict and Beatrice, you are a plain villain! and have no soul. That two people could find each other such as this, and fall in love, gives hope for the world.

At the risk of repeating myself (see my other reviews), if you haven't seen a Globe Theatre production of Shakespeare, you haven't seen Shakespeare. Seeing Shakespeare performed in his native environment (an outdoor circular theatre where the ""groundlings"" are right up to the stage), you realize why Shakespeare wrote some of the things he wrote or staged the action the way he did. In this production, about 20 minutes from the end, the way Benedict interacts with an audience member is hilarious.

That being said, the director chose to stage this adaption as more leaning towards farce. Claudio, at the beginning of the play, acts like an idiot, and Don John hams up his villainy for comedic effect. Okay, I guess, but I think Kenneth Branagh's version is probably closer to what Shakespeare intended. The scene in that version where Beatrice asks Benedict to kill Claudio is harrowing (the hairs on my neck stand up every time I watch it). In this version, you never really worry about anything that will happen; it's all comedy and farce and you know it will be fine. Again, nothing necessary wrong with that, but I prefer my Shakespeare less modern (""comedy"" in modern usage means laughs; ""comedy"" in Shakespeare's time just meant everything works out in the end).

The advantage this performance has over others (including Branagh's version) is that the text is not abridged. They perform every line of the original play; the only alteration I caught was they replaced the ""boy"" that gets Benedict's book with Margaret (I guess to save an actor). It's nice to see the play in its entirety (the only other way is to watch the BBC version).

So if you like Shakespeare, this is must-see viewing. And please check out the other Globe productions on DVD, especially Henry IV Part 1.",1375920000,3,2082,4.7272727272727275
3337205,5,B0013B34RQ,"I have seen three different Shakespeare plays at the Globe theater in London, and they have all been a fantastic experience.  Two of them (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Othello-Shakespeare-s-Globe-Theatre-Production/dp/B0012EM5CE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Othello (Shakespeare's Globe Theatre Production)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-VIII-Shakespeare-s-Globe-Theatre/dp/B007LNBSU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry VIII: Shakespeare's Globe Theatre</a>) have been released as dvd's  But, I haven't watched them yet.  This is the first dvd from the Globe that I have watched- and loved it.

The reconstructed Globe theater is essentially an exact reproduction of a theatre (almost on this exact spot) where many of Shakespeare's plays were actually performed.  It is open air, quite ""natural"", with seats and standing room (groundlings) just as in 1600.  In fact, to me, with only a slight exaggeration, it is very much like being back 400 years and watching one of his plays.  Certainly the productions are meant to be reasonably authentic to those times.  And what great fun it is.

""Much Ado"" is my favorite comedy, with great verbal wit between Beatrice and Benedict, and a plot and dialogue that it quite easy to follow. Here, Charles Edwards as Benedict really shines for me with a terrific performance.  All of the actors were very good, but I thought he was excellent (as did my wife).

The staging was quite effective and funny, and it was well filmed.

The closeness of the audience (the groundlings) and being able to see audience members in the background in some shots, makes this whole performance really come alive.  And, it even rained (drizzled) throughout much of the performance which heightened the reality of it even more.  Terrific.

Let me say that if you get to London (and you should- a great city) you must go to the Globe theater to see a Shakespeare play.  The regular season is May through early October.  I understand that they are building a small indoor theater (about 300 seats) with candle lighting(!!) which is due to open in 2014 to put on plays all year.  Don't miss it.  But, these dvd's are a very good substitute.",1375228800,,2257,5.663690476190476
3337206,5,B0013B34RQ,"The Kenneth Branagh film is a fun romance, but this production is far superior. Filmed in performance at The Globe, the production is faithful to the text. The acting is wonderful, especially from the actors portraying Beatrice and Benedick.",1369180800,6,241,5.205128205128205

3337208,4,B0013B34RQ,"I think it is no accident that two out of the three five star reviews were written by people who saw a performance by this troupe live, on stage, as this production demonstrates the strengths of a live performance, especially in an Elizabethan theatre, and the drawbacks of filming such a performance.

The recreation of the Globe was a delight. I confess I suspect the theatre is substantially larger than the original, although the shape is the same. The stage puts the actors very close to the audience. At a few points, the actors interact with audience members. Unfortunately, that means there is no way to have cameras come up to film the actors with close-ups. All the filming was probably done from three stationary cameras in the center, and to the left and right of the stage, at the back of the ""groundlings"" (See Shakespeare's Hamlet, Act III, Scene II: ""...to split the ears of the groundlings, who for the most part are capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise."") I was even skeptical of whether the actors wore microphones, or whether all the dialogue was picked up by small microphones around the stage. For a person with normal hearing, with normal or slightly higher volume than normal, all the dialogue could be heard plainly; however, I can appreciate the problem of a person with impaired hearing. The lighting and the sound from the group of instruments on the Mezzanine level above the stage was a bit weak.

The acting by the principals, Charles Edwards as Benedick and Eve Best as Beatrice, was superior. The acting by most others was good by Shakespearean standards. I agree with the reviewer who was not happy with the characterization of Dogberry and his scenes. I looked at Dogberry's dialogue in the play, and I see very little which would support the kind of business and conceits played by this Dogberry.

In many ways, this production suffers in comparison to Kenneth Branagh's production with an all star cast. Even Dogberry is played by a major name actor, Michael Keaton and lesser roles are played by actors in the front rank of Shakespearean acting such as Richard Briars and Brian Blessed. Keaton's interpretation of Dogberry is far more imaginative than the one in this production, although it seems a fair number of Dogberry's scenes were cut by Branagh. But the comparison is unfair, as they are virtually two different media, which we happen to see on film. This production has the virtue of being complete, as Shakespeare wrote it, not twisted about here and there, as when Branagh puts Balthazar's ""hey, nonny, nonny"" song in Beatrice's mouth.

Get this version if you want true Shakespeare. Get Branagh's version if you want a glittering interpretation.",1367107200,5,2715,4.87012987012987
3337209,5,B0013B34RQ,"This is Shakespeare done very right.  This production ran in London at the same time as the more famous David Tennant Catherine Tate modern version, and this is every bit as good - it's funny, romantic, well acted...",1365811200,,216,4.684210526315789
3337210,3,B0013B34RQ,"This Globe production is not, in our family's opinion, up to the standards of the other Globe comedies, especially the wonderful Love's Labours' Lost.  Among the worst Dogberry-Verges night watch subplots we've ever seen.  Bad casting of Dogberry.  It must be a British thing if they like it.  The other actors' performances were good.
We watched the Kultur edition, not knowing that there was available a superior Opus Arte edition.  Opus Arte's Globe DVD's include subtitles and they add enormously to the understanding and pleasure of watching the plays.  This Kultur one does not.  I wear hearing aids and have a TV with good speakers and have seen the play several times and still could not understand many of the lines.  Even two other members of my family had difficulty understanding at times.  I wish that producers who make critical decisions about such things as subtitles understood how much they matter.",1363737600,20,916,5.013245033112582
