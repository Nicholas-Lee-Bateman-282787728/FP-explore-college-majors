6251587,4,B00I5Q6IMU,"some years ago my father, then a police officer, reported anonymously to a newspaper about the alleged affair of a married governor, who was related to a very powerful government official. I knew nothing about it at the time. also around that time I spoke out (in a private conversation to a taxi driver) against the Iraq War (I suspected it was a resource grab). I'd discussed my thoughts with my father on the phone and one theory is that he was under surveillance and our conversation was taped. I've never learned which of these incidents got me on an harassment/watch list, but for over the past 15 years I've been harassed to distraction by government anti-terrorist agencies (ordinary citizens would likely not believe the tactics the government uses, I'm targeted at the grocery store, on the bus, in public bathrooms, in my apartment by people above me following me from room to room, etc., including physical attacks), which has helped make me sick, but who have yet to charge me with anything. it goes without saying that I've broken no laws and of course am not a terrorist (I worked for years as a legal secretary/legal word processor before becoming too ill to work). watching this series, I saw the characters go through several familiar incidents, but essentially the main character has support from his girlfriend and his former co-worker plus he has money, which I do not have. it is hugely different and so much worse when you're a lone, poor minority. innocence doesn't protect you. the up side is that I've learned so much about who we are as a species and how the underside of a government actually works and the difference between PR and reality of this particular democracy. for example, in this trilogy when Worricker gets upset that his innocent artist daughter is being targeted/seduced by a government agent and asks that that be stopped, I couldn't help but laugh: I know by living it that anyone the target cares about is fair game to anti-terrorist agencies. I am amazed (no exaggeration) every day when I awake that I haven't been killed in the night or that agents haven't busted into my apartment at 4 am, and this is coming from an innocent citizen. our anti-terrorist agencies (or perhaps just some of them) are out of control but they've got that national security mantel and can do just about what they want. I like this program not only because of the good acting but because the story gives a tiny taste of what it's actually like to be targeted by your government. Worricker knows how these agencies work, for me it's been an horrific learning experience and one I wouldn't wish on my worse enemy. I dream of applying for political asylum in Norway and writing a book and living a quiet life but powerful anti-terrorist agencies would no doubt harass me even there, but I'd still happily go in the hope of lessening the intensity of the abuse. 100 years from now probably a few of the abuses will have trickled out and be general knowledge but societies trusting their leaders and their governments have no idea of the abuses and would be shocked. my theory is that because of global warming and projected resource limitations that will impact all of us, some of the more proactive ""democratic"" governments are beginning now the underground entrapment/enslavement of it's citizens around the world. I see how I've been treated, I've seen the hundreds of people used to harass me over the last 15 years and I see how the government has engaged my family and what I've got to say to anyone reading this comment is that our species is in serious trouble. innocence, education, solid work ethic and working multiple jobs simultaneously, paying your taxes, and following the rules will not protect you. I rate this trilogy 3 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 4.",1417219200,2,3791,4.736762481089259

6251597,4,B00I5Q6IMU,"Tip: If you buy this in the US and can't watch it because of stupid regional restrictions, there are ways around that. For one you could just download it from the pirate bay for free, but I don't normally recommend that as I have no problem with paying for my entertainment, but when doing the right thing is made difficult by the manufacturers, well, sometimes you just want to eliminate the hassle, and quite often, you can actually get a better quality copy with no commercials, no restrictions, no regional crap.

What I do recommend though, you download a program called Handbrake. This will allow you to rip the DVD files into mp4 or mkv files. If there are licensing restrictions that prevent you from ripping, you want to search for and find a file called 'libdvdcss.dll' that you can download and put into the Handbrake folder in Program Files and it will bypass the restriction. Once you have your video file you can just put it on a flash drive and pop it in and watch it. Or you can further download a program called Nero Express that will take your video file of any type and burn it to a DVD, in the proper file format so that you can watch it in a regular DVD player right here in the US.

I know it sounds complicated, but when the manufacturer makes it difficult to impossible to watch the disks YOU PAID FOR, sometimes you just have to improvise.",1443571200,,1364,4.430278884462151

6251600,5,B00I5Q6IMU,"I enjoyed this trilogy. Bill Nighy plays Johnny Worricker, a very likable British spy. Johnny is surprisingly irresistible to women of a certain age. The plot has a few holes, there are too many coincidences, but that does not really matter. The acting and the dialogue hold your attention. Johnny is a senior MI5 agent. He finds out that the British prime minister has benefited financially from a dodgy deal involving a New Jersey construction company. The company built secret prisons for the US government and over-charged. The CIA wants the money back. You are initially encouraged to believe that the prime minister has committed a shocking crime, but he's just another crooked politician. Worricker is disillusioned by the abuse of power and confronts the prime minister. He is forced to go on the run.

Johnny turns up in the Caribbean and then Germany. You never feel particularly frightened for Johnny, it is not that sort of movie. It is a spy film with no on-screen violence and is more John Le Carre than Robert Ludlum. The prime minister is the main villain, but he is not particularly dangerous. The film wants you to believe that there is a core of honorable people in the British establishment who believe in truth and honesty. They will always try to do the right thing, even it means defying a popular prime minister. Johnny is a nice man and a brilliant spy, but he has a complicated private life. There are a lot of beautiful women in his life. He also has a complex relationship with his daughter (Felicity Jones) who blames him for being a hopeless father. Nighy is delightful as Johnny and the series is entertaining.

The cast and the acting is superb. Judy Davis (as an MI5 chief) and Ralph Fiennes (British prime minister) are excellent. Michael Gambon (Johnny's boss) and Rachel Weisz (Johnny's beautiful neighbor) only appear in episode one. Winona Ryder seems to have a crush on Johnny in episode two. Helena Bonham Carter becomes Johnny's girlfriend in episode three. Rupert Graves (a friend of the prime minister) appears in episodes two and three.

David Hare wrote and directed the series. In interviews, Hare has declared his opposition to the Iraq War and was outraged that under Tony Blair's leadership, Britain became totally subservient to the U.S. Hare is always angry and hated Blair. But you can enjoy the series without focusing on the politics. Watching Nighy play Worricker is entertaining enough.",1436745600,,2442,4.893719806763285
6251601,5,B00I5Q6IMU,"Actually, the discs I received were British playable only.  My fault -- I guess I didn't read the vendor's remarks or understand them.  I returned them for a refund.  No problem with that.",1436140800,,188,4.636363636363637

6251603,5,B00I5Q6IMU,"Good story. I would like to see more programming of this quality. In the espionage genre of movies this more realistic than the Mission Impossible
type of rubbish the we have with Tom Cruise type",1431907200,,195,4.6
6251604,5,B00I5Q6IMU,"The spy/mystery trilogy follows Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy), a disgruntled MI5 analyst, as he struggles with his own demons and the governmental apparatus trying to silence him. At the center of this thriller is Worricker's knowledge of shady dealings involving the prime minister (Ralph Fiennes) and his on-again, off-again relationship with Helena Bonham Carter.

This is a taut thriller well-directed by David Hare. The cast members are of the highest caliber. Nighy can say more with his eyes and pauses than most actors could. Hare manages to introduce Christopher Walken in the middle section as a rogue CIA operative.

If you were a fan of Smiley's People, this is a delightful espionage thriller in the same vein.",1431820800,,723,5.170940170940171

8639434,5,B00I5Q6IMU,"Finally received this trilogy and watched it nonstop. Much like a lovely bottle of vintage wine, I really regretted its coming to an end.

The three feature length episodes are different but interrelated. The bones of the plots are fairly straightforward but the complexity of the characters, the quality of the performances and (most importantly) the complexity of the global issues they deal with, are what make the series a winner.

No one is perfect, no one is either a straight hero or villain, and no one is without flaws. It takes a special cast to pull this off and they did it brilliantly.

Bill Nighy (of course) gets top marks, but significant dramatic frisson resulted from the others, including (but certainly not limited to) the incomparable Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham-Carter.

Highly recommended.",1517702400,,816,5.067164179104478

Worricker Trilogy
Amazon Video
Part 1

British spy, Johnny Worricker (Bill Nighy) nearing the end of his career, puts it all in the line. His boss and best friend has damaging information on the Prime Minister but dies before it can be verified.

Clever, cagy but always charming Johnny owes his career to his boss. As a debt of honor, Johnny investigates the explosive allegations which puts him on a collision course with MI-5 and Downing Street.

Writer-Director David Hare is a great playwright who is just as talented as a screenwriter. Nighy is right at home with Hares curt, witty dialog.

The first class cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Rachel Weisz, the legendary Judy Davis, Alice Krige and pre-Star Wars Felicity Jones as Nighys resentful daughter.

And then theres Bill Nighy. Versatile doesnt do him justice. Remember the drugged out rock star that was trying to record a Christmas hit in Love Actually? Mr. Bill.

Jills Short Review of:
Worricker Trilogy Parts 2 and 3
Amazon Video
Part 2
On the run from the his government, British spy Johnny Worricker has made his way to Turks and Caicos. Hes got major dirt on the British Prime Minister in his back pocket so hes lying low, enjoying the Caribbean scenery. Christopher Walken shows up as a CIA agent who blackmails Johnny into helping him nab two unsavory characters with tainted business ties to the British Prime Minister.
Part 2 is more mystery than thriller so writer-director David Hare slows the tempo a bit but Johnny and his new circle of friends are still as intriguing as ever.
Winona Ryder is very good as a young woman caught in the orbit of the unsavories and Helena Bonham Carter takes a break from all the fairy tale characters and treats us to a smart nuanced former spy who is every bit Johnnys equal.
Part 3
Johnny and his former lover and former spy Margo ( Helena Bonham Carter) crisscross Europe but as they run out of money and options they come back to England and Johnny takes an unpredictable stand. He also makes a long overdue stab at healing family divisions.
Bill Nighys Johnny Worricker is complicated, likable, witty, charming and one of the most interesting screen characters Ive spent time with. I hope you find him the same. Thank you David Hare.",1509926400,,2265,4.748091603053435
