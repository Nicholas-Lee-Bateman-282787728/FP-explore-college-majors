8441108,4,B004TYOQGW,"I taped this movie from TV years ago.  It is suspenseful.  It's when you find out the cause for the ebola outbreak that you realize
it could come from today's headlines with all of the things people will do for money and their own gain.  This movie bears watching.
It's too bad it's not on Region 1 DVD.  It should be.  It's in the same vein as the Dustin Hoffman ""Virus"" movie which came out later
only better and with a different twist.  I would buy it on DVD.  In the meantime I still have my taped from TV version.",1362182400,,518,4.12
