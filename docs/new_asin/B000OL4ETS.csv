8185516,5,B000OL4ETS,"I love this movie so much am going to buy it since it's not here on streaming. It's one of those 'give it the first 1/2 hour' then it really unfolds, but I did feel charmed by it from the beginning. Rani Mukerjee is great in this, the scenery when she gets to Shimla is lovely. I have only seen Ajay play a love interest in a non-violent movie (which I don't watch anyway) a couple of times (the other one, 5 star, is Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam, what a movie!) but he's not your romancer in this one really tho is the lead and it's ultimately a quirky film. Sweet and fun and while I don't always like the song & dance, this one they are few and far between and yet delightful. Give it the first 20 min or so til she gets to Shimla. Hope you like it. It stayed with me and stands out as a fav. But I'm a full on Rani Mukerjee (Mukerji) fan. She has this quality that is remarkable and I find her an amazing actress whatever she plays in.",1503100800,,933,3.941798941798942

8185518,4,B000OL4ETS,"This is a charming Bollywood remake of  Housesitter starring Goldie Hawn and Steve Martin. Ajay Devgn as the obsessive wanna be love interest of glamorous Sonali Bendre is the perfect foil for the  ever delightful and bubbly Rani Mukerji in this love triangle.  There is enough song and dance that typifies Indian cinema, but not too much. As in the original, Ajay's architect character builds his dream house for his long time crush only to be rejected. Enter Rani in need of a place to crash and pretending  to be Ajay's wife to be and the fun begins. While his family embraces Rani's character immediately it takes Ajay awhile to realize he loves her, too. In true Bollywood style there is the scene where he erupts in anger, insulting her and sending her away. After the tears and drama he proposes and the fairy tale begins! This version is less zany than the original owing to the casting. Ajay Devgn's character is more serious and brooding than Steve Martin could ever be and Rani ,while always delightful, is not as eccentric as the original Laugh In girl. It is a sweet rom-com. I enjoyed it. Rani is my favorite Bollywood actress and I always appreciate Ajay in a more sensitive role.",1418688000,,1195,4.649289099526066
8185519,5,B000OL4ETS,"Was never a big fan of Ajay Devgan until recently, but he fits so well into this role. What can loosely be described as the Bollywood adaptation of the Steve Martin/Goldie Hawn movie ""Housesitter"", is a lighthearted romantic tale where the players in a game of love find the joke is on them. Easy viewing and a lovely way to spend a few hours.",1253664000,,343,4.375
8185520,3,B000OL4ETS,"As in the Steve Martin/Goldie Hawn movie 'The Housesitter, we have an architect guy (Ajay Devgan)turned down in a marriage proposal (by Sonali Bendre). He crosses paths with a free spirit girl (Rani Mukergee) who lives in a dream world and  has a loose relationship with honesty and truth. Unknown to the guy, for somewhere to live she decides to move into a house the guy is building near his family. She tells the family she is the girlfriend and they develop a close connection with her and are keen for a marriage. Guy finds out but realizes his old girlfriends jealousy over the situation is making him look a more appealing partner. So he strikes a deal to continue the presence for a while to kindle the former girlfriends interest...
This is one of Rani's best performances and the movie is worth watching for that. Sonali and Ajay are also good. Although some people seemed to really connect with the romance I didn't quite so much. I think it is because Ajay plays such an internalized romantic hero and I like my heros to have more life and zip to them, and to have a greater range of eye expressions to show emotions. Obviously this is personal taste. The music was OK and the songs definitely could be good at unfolding underlying inner conflict and dilemma but I didn't take any melodies away with me- again personal taste. The plot is good and the support actors mostly convincing too.
I found it a pleasant way to pass time and I'll keep it but it didn't shine as one of the best. Elsewhere on the Net I found some were more convinced by the screen chemistry than me but some thought the movie really poor, and the screenplay lacking. IMDb had it rating between a 5 and 6 out of 10 on average  - with women (and even more older women) liking it more. If you like Bolywood and romances its worth a look - if you do relate more to Ajay Devgan's restrained stoical hero obviously you will get more out of it than me too.",1244073600,,1933,4.411764705882353
8185521,5,B000OL4ETS,"RANI rocks in this film! AJAY is outstanding! Two people, who are absolutely opposite in everyway, find themselves on the downside of life. She, a lonely but high-spirited soul, has become jobless and homeless. He, a serious but dream-driven individual, has just been rejected by the love of his life. Eventually, their paths cross when she invades his ""dream-designed"" life by passing herself off as his fiance. That's when the fun starts and the web of lies that they weave together ends up bonding them deeper into each other's lives to the point of falling in love. This love story is filled with humorous highlights and teary struggles that only these stars could bring to the Bollywood screen. A must for any film collection.",1237939200,4,731,4.903225806451613
8185522,4,B000OL4ETS,"Ranbir Malhotra (Ajay Devgan) is a quiet man. Ranbir is also an architect, who figured it was time to settle down and get married. Planning to propose, he drives his longtime girlfriend Pooja (Sonali Bendre) to the countryside, where he presents her with a half-constructed house decorated with a giant bow. This house is her engagement gift and intended to be their future residence. But the practical-minded Pooja rejects the proposal, wanting a husband who's more stable and citing that Ranbir has hardly been the kind of man to keep his feet on the ground. So that's that.

Khushi (Rani Mukerji) is an impish, happy-go-lucky orphan (not at all practical-minded) and a hostess in a Delhi banquet hall. She happens to meet a drunk and very depressed Ranbir at a work-related party. Ranbir ends up walking Khushi home and unburdens his grief to her before they part ways. But Khushi is about to get her share of woes as the next morning finds her fired from her job and evicted from her home. Now homeless and near destitute, she recalls Ranbir's story, and importantly the abandoned house. In a pretty unconvincing sequence, Khushi, not having a specific address, searches the countryside for that house, heavy luggages in tow. And she finds it, and moves in. Then a deception on her part leads everyone, including Ranbir's family and Ranbir's ex-girlfriend, to believe that she and Ranbir are now engaged.

What'll happen when Ranbir finds out about all this? Well, Ranbir unexpectedly decides to temporarily go along with the pretense, in an effort to spike the interest of his ex-girlfriend Pooja. And, well, Khushi, she really knows how to build him up to look like the romantic hero.

CHORI CHORI (Everyone Falls In Love), released in 2003 and logging in at 2 hours 15 minutes, basically takes its story premise from the 1992 Hollywood picture&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Housesitter/dp/078322740X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Housesitter</a>, which starred Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. CHORI CHORI actually improves some on HOUSESITTER, although, yes, HOUSESITTER is merely an average movie.

There's one clear cut reason why this movie works, and that reason is the lovely Rani Mukerji. This is clearly Rani's world, and Ajay Devgan just pays rent in it. Rani is a delight, and damn if she isn't so good that she pulls off that trick of being simultaneously opportunistic and winsome. Her character has learned to be very self-sufficient, you see, and doesn't hesitate to lie and scheme and even shoplift as required. Rani has already proven that she fares very well in straight drama (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saathiya/dp/B0000AMAFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saathiya</a>) and she'll prove it again in the excellent 2005 film (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black/dp/B000J1J3BM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black</a>). In CHORI CHORI, she tries her hand at light romantic comedy, this one being more or less in the same vein as her later film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bunty-aur-Babli-2-DVD-Set/dp/B000EJ1VLE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bunty aur Babli (2 DVD Set)</a>. Here, Rani not only proves that she's a deft comedienne, but she also gets to showcase her dramatic acting skills as she gets enough scenes to display sadness, wistfulness, and vulnerability. By the way, I feel kinda sheepish now, having not been too kind to Rani in BUNTY AUR BABLI. That movie was the first time I ever saw her and, in watching her other films, she's improved dramatically in my eyes (though I still say her performance in BUNTY AUR BABLI is inferior to her performance here).

Unlike BUNTY AUR BABLI's very likable hero (played by Abhishek Bachchan), CHORI CHORI's male lead fails to match Rani's charisma. I've seen Ajay Devgan in several films now and he's never really been what you'd call a demonstrative actor. This isn't necessarily a bad thing as he's skilled enough to convey emotions even while being still and reserved. The best I've ever seen Ajay Devgan was in his sensitive performance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hum-Dil-de-Chuke-Sanam/dp/B000V79RBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hum Dil de Chuke Sanam</a>. Here, he doesn't seem fully engaged, and this disconnect impacts the meager character development which comes his way. All in all, his Ranbir comes across as a grumpy dullard moping around in stylish, tight-fitting shirts. You start wondering what the effervescent Khushi sees in the guy.

One doesn't really get the feeling that Sonali Bendre's character was gonna get the happy ending, but, still, Sonali does her best with the little screen time she's granted. She's pretty, though.

The plot may be utterly predictable, but CHORI CHORI still knocks it out of the park during its lighthearted first half as Rani simply makes you fall in love with her. Then the second half comes around and, as usual for Bollywood flicks, the heavy soap opera surfaces. Along with the songs inserted post-intermission, the melodramatic theatrics prove to be debilitating to the plot. There are moments in which the story comes to a screeching halt. But, thanks mostly to the work Rani puts in, CHORI CHORI still ends up being a very watchable movie.

Four parting shots:

One, I loved all those close-ups of Rani Mukerji. She showed such vitality in this movie.

Two, the ever somber Ajay Devgan and musical numbers go hand in hand about as well as a midget and a top shelf.

Three, this film, without Rani, is a two-star film. With Rani, the rating floats up to three and a half stars.

Four, that stuffed monkey, Jonathan, is really too, too precious (sense the tone).",1206144000,,5801,5.498316498316498
8185523,5,B000OL4ETS,"This story is about an architect(Ranbi)who is in love with his childhood friend he starts to build his dream house for her and takes her there as a way of asking her to marry him.......but sadly she declines because one cannot live in dreams she says and she can not give herself to somone who is starting out in life who has yet to accomplish wealth and a name for himself.

Everyone one falls in love.  Or so they say.  It's the one thing that makes the mornings glow, the days flow, and puts a smile on evening.  It's the one thing we know nothing about...not even when it happens.  It sneaks up on us like the wind in the woods, and washes us with it  freshness.
This movie is great I like Rani Mukherji who plays Khushi and Ajay Devgan playing Ranbi anyone with a heart will fall in love with this movie.",1200614400,,1965,4.166666666666667
