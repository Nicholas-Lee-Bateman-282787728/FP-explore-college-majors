7120452,5,B00W605FDO,"What a terrific movie!  I had forgotten how wonderful this movie was until we purchased it for our daughters.  The music is stunning, and the voices are perfectly fit for the characters they serve.  Especially noteworthy is Louis Prima as ""King Louie"".  The score is beautiful as well, using much haunting alto flute playing.  A masterpiece that deserves a place on everyone's video shelf!",985564800,6,389,5.015625
7120453,5,B00W605FDO,"If I had to pick my favorite Disney movie, it would be this one.  Why, love the music!!  Too bad it is a typical Disney DVD with no extras.  Would have loved them.",982368000,2,163,3.878787878787879
7120454,5,B00W605FDO,"This wonderful, delightful, joyful animated story of a young mancube that was orphaned by Shere khan as a baby. He was saved by Bagheera and brought  to a wolf family and was raised as one of there own. About nine years later  the man hating Shere Khan retured to that part of the jungle. The wolf clan  decided that it would be best that Mowgli (the mancube) went back to the  man village. Bagheera voluntered to bring him back. They encountered the  sly snake that hypnotyze his pray, the army elephants that never forget,  the wild orangatang king that lives in the temple, the beatle like  voltuers, and you can't forget the great one Baloo who has a free loving  spirit.",966211200,,675,4.520661157024794
7120455,4,B00W605FDO,"Yet another in Disney's self proclaimed Masterpiece editions, The Jungle Book is a lot of fun but not one of Disney's best.  Watch this video for some great songs and wonderful characters but please excuse the flimsy  story which is all but cancelled out in the film's final scene.  Still, the  movement captured by the Disney animators, especially in the case of  Bagheera, is a marvel to watch.  With all these great characters (Baloo,  Shere Kahn, King Louie wonderfully voiced by Louis Prima) and memorable  songs (The Bear Neccesities) it's unfortunate that the story couldn't also  have been worthwhile.  Still, no one will resist adding this to their  clam-shell collection before it's gone...for now at least.",961027200,,717,5.094827586206897
7120456,5,B00W605FDO,"The feature-length cartoons Disney continues to produce are fine films, but nowhere near as good as classics like The Jungle Book.  Unburdened by the modern-day Disney habit of giving every film a heavy family-friendly  moral message, the Jungle Book is just 100% pure fun, with a cool hero  (Mowgli), entertaining friends (especially the bear Baloo) and some great  villainous characters (most memorably Shere Khan the tiger).  This movie  was made years before Phil Collins or Elton John were drafted in as cartoon  soundtrack composers, and the songs are just awesome - ""The Bare  Necessities"", ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and Kaa the snake's  hissed encouragement to ""Trust in Me"".  Get this DVD while you  can!",959212800,48,709,5.078260869565217
7120457,5,B00W605FDO,"This movie is more than just another Disney masterpiece.  The Jungle Book is a great tale of friendship and adventure.  Although almost every animated feature that was created during Walt Disney's life is a classic,  this one in particular holds a special place in the heart of many men (and  now thanks to video and DVD, boys) who saw it while growing up.  There  isn't a boy alive who can see this movie and not want to be Mowgli.  What a  life it would be to live in the jungle, with friends like Baloo and  Bagheera.  It is every young boys dream to be so free.
That is not to say  that only boys will love this movie.  As with all Disney films, this one  will be enjoyed by all members of the family, young and old.  I saw it  growing up, and never forgot my memories of the movie, and the days  afterward, singing the songs and dreaming of adventure.
The music in  The Jungle Book is some of the best in any Disney movie.  ""The Bare  Necessities"" is simply one of the best songs ever.  Add in the fantastic  animation and the characters that come to life (who wouldn't believe a bear  could sing after seeing this?), and you have one of the many classic Disney  stories.
Starring the voices of Disney regulars Phil Harris and Sterling  Holloway, as well as Sebastian Cabot (Mr. French, to those of my  generation) and many others, this movie is too good to not buy.
Get a  copy of this DVD before Disney removes it for another generation.  It is  the best that Disney has to offer.",956966400,198,1487,4.3090909090909095
7120458,5,B00W605FDO,"By far, this is my favorite Disney & what does it is the music.  Some Disney films may have characters I love more with the great music, but this one does it.  Well done by the Sherman Brothers.",956361600,,194,4.078947368421052

7120460,1,B00W605FDO,my advice is - don't bother!  this dvd is exacty it`s the same as the vhs version! .it is NOT dolby surround as stated but only stereo and there are no extras on the disc at all.the colour and sound are the same as the vhs  version-not re-mastered or enhanced at all for dvd.if you have it on vhs  don't waste your money!,945648000,38,321,4.063492063492063
7120461,5,B00W605FDO,"I am nearly 4o years old & this film brings back all the joys, magic, & wonder that we sometimes loose touch with as we grow older. I still catch myself singing the songs whilst doing some chore. I bought a copy for  my cousins although my uncle is the one that wears out the tape! They live  in another county so I don't get the chance to see the movie much. I  foolishly didn't buy a copy for myself & desperatly want a copy to be  cherished in my home to share with my friends, so come on Disney re-release  the film pleeeeeeese.",943660800,4,532,4.076923076923077

7120468,2,B00W605FDO,"Fails the Bechdel test, mostly because there are no female characters at all. Boy lives in the jungle with animals and raised by bears, yet both decides to wear clothes and is able to fashion himself a suitable garment. A bunch of animals that naturally live in different parts of the world inexplicably meet. Orangutans are coded African-American and talk about wanting to be real people.

It is much too frightening. The Scary is too real in comparison with the animated Disney movie which had just enough scary but much more re moved from reality to make it palatable without too much fear of inducing nightmares.
I hated Bill Murray as Balloo & I hated the ending.",1516320000,,452,4.392857142857143

The fight between him and Baloo was much more realistic than the 1967 cartoon.  The best part is that the wolves show up throughout the movie while in the 1967 cartoon they were in the first 5 minutes and never seen again, not even in the 2003? Jungle Book 2.  CGI was very impressive and the wolves actually looked real, as in live action, despite looking more like North American wolves than Indian wolves.

It is tempting to compare them because they are the same(ish) story, but I think it is best to look at these movies as separate entities.  At any rate, if you know the story and want to insert some live action shows into the rotation for the kids, this isn't a bad way to go.  It is a little more direct with the violence, so if you're looking to shield your children, skip this and go back to the animated version.

7120711,5,B00W605FDO,"This brings back the jungle book's amazing story as a child, and i don't think the changes to it effected the overall story, one bit. if anything it dug deeper into the story, not made it any less powerful. you didn't loose anything, and in fact, it really felt like there was a whole story there.  a move done well is rare, especially when i say this. just overall GREAT acting & film.  there could have been a million ways to mess this up, and these guys actually did it right!  props to all who created the special, effects, as well, for they are most definitely  the BEST special effects i have ever seen. Even beets Avitar any day !  also, not too much singing in this one & the songs you do have are actually enjoyable, and are the ones that count!  We simply can't for get ""bear necessities""  as even though i'm not a huge fan of singing, i would have thrown a fit if that  one wasn't in there.  there were also very comical moments that you just can't pass up and could watch days on end and not get tired of it...i think it will be stuck in my head forever.
hysterical & tear-wrenching at the same time, a movie you can really fall in love with, and characters presented in the best light!  Even the tiger had a reason to be as mean as he was.  who wouldn't be?  personally, would have liked to see him go after the entire  village, instead of picking on a defenseless runt  that has no say in it.  but then he wouldn't have made that iconic  villain!  the eyes for the tiger and the expression was just amazing; it gave him a true magic about him, as well as the panther.
The wolves actually looked like real wolves;  where perhaps the ear posture and lips wasn't perfect in terms of wolf behavior, it was almost spot-on for when a wolf is defensive.  at one point in the movie, the wolves looked more unsure and scared and worried, when they were actually supposed to be matching a fiercely  growling and a snarling scene.  but if you don't know ""wolf  Language"" then you wouldn't have known this.  WAY more accurate than twilight, OR beauty & the beat remake. Best wolves yet!  and this is coming from somebody who has studied  a bit of wolf behavior.  keep up the good work humans!
some of my favorite  quotes  and moments were where...""leaf...leaf!...that's mine...Rock!...that's mine....rock...rock...that's mine...rock...that's mine...""
and the ""i has ears that has ears....""  one

and who can forget that priceless little moment of when the wolf pup that  only forgets the word ""wolf""  in the pledge.  that would have totally been me!!!!",1499558400,3,2554,4.482608695652174

Not only did it shine, but I was able to view it in 2160p glory. Just gorgeous. I have to say this is one of my favorite Walt Disney movies and now that it is ""Live Action"" is even better!! I thought the cast did an amazing job with it. The characters did come to life for me and were believable. I will watch this again and again in months ahead. The 3D looks really good here, too. Disney, you did a stellar job on this, so keep 'em coming if they can look like this one!
~ The Musical Score, The Animals and effects were spot on, in my opinion. This has to be one of the very best ""Live Action"" adaptations so far for Disney!

7120755,5,B00W605FDO,"I am old and grey now, but really enjoyed the adaptation of this film.
""The Jungle Book"" was one of my favorites as a child.
Raised 4 kids and ""own"" most ""Disney Animated"" films on both VHS and DVD (we have watched them ""a million times"". Parents will know what I mean).
Mowgli was fantastic.
The animation and CG of this old ""classic"" was wonderful.
In classic Disney style, there is great attention to detail (also a mixture of ""Light/Fun"" and ""Dark/Scary"").
There is a scene where Baloo and Bagheera are crossing a river, chasing the monkeys to ""King Louie"" and the camera ""lens"" gets splashed with animated water, very cool!
Limbs of trees move with animal weight, animal footprints left as they walk, etc......

I would however be very ""cautious"" about letting ""little ones"" watch some of the violent animal scenes in this movie.
It is NOT a ""cartoon""!!!
Quote: ""Rated PG for some sequences of scary action and peril""!!!!!!!

Most of the movie is delightful and fun.
My only complaint would be that towards the end, with all the ""fire"", the scenes were so ""dark"" it was difficult to see some of the detail in the movie.

If you enjoy Disney flicks, I think you will enjoy this one.
Try not to compare it to the ""great"" original cartoon, there is enough of the original story line to keep you engaged. Naturally, voices are changed/different, King ""Kong"" Louie was a little ""big"" (Ha). Let it stand on its own.

Note: Watch the ""credits"" and enjoy the scenes and music! - (Scarlett Johansson (Kaa), Dr. John, Christopher Walken (King Louie), etc

This is a visually stunning movie and I will usually balk at total CGI movies. the voice talents are outstanding and the best is the little boy who plays Mowgli. This kid is nothing short of amazing. The directing by Jon Favreau is off the charts, what an eye for detail. I wholeheartedly recommend this movie for young and old but as a caution let me throw this out there. There is one scene that is probably going to be hard on little kids and you should be aware it is between the wolf pack leader and Shere Khan the Tiger. Other than that, love Neel Sethi, the boy and the characters are so real and genuine too. Bill Murray as Baloo is outstanding.",1492473600,,701,4.2781954887218046

You just cant and its fair to say that this live action/ CGI mix doesnt try to but simply tries to capture the magic of the story of an orphaned young boy raised by jungle animals but who is led back to mans village for his own proetection. And on that account it succeeds famously well with some set pieces that are just awe inspiring, as is King Louies immensity. This version has some music and some song but it isn't a musical like the original, but the original simply doesnt muster the menace that Mowgli faces at almost every turn as this one manages to depict in a fairly safe but still effective PG rated way. Kaa the monstrous constrictor is bound to generate nightmares but it never actually threatens Mowgli outside of unnerving presence. The vicious Shere Khan is vicious in the way he maintains and utilizes his aggression and threat far far moreso than he is physically vicious. If theres one thing that this film ends up lacking it would be a sense of dread, but suspense is still maintained. This is entirely appropriate for a kids movie and The Jungle Book balances these issues nicely. Kudos to director Jon Favreau for pulling this off.",1490486400,,1205,4.583333333333333

7120827,5,B00W605FDO,"Jon Faverau's live action remake of a late 60s Disney animated classic (and the last film Walt Disney himself worked on at the time of his death) is an extraordinary masterpiece that is truly remarkable and a lot better than the original 1967 animated film! The cast is great as are the special effects.

It seemed as though Jon Faverau wanted to accomplish the same goal he accomplished with ""Elf"" in that you feel like you could walk right into this world! He succeeded! You truly feel like you can walk right into the jungles of India in this film!

Plus, I'm super happy this won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects! It truly deserved it and it deserved to be a critically acclaimed monster hit at the box office!

7120928,4,B00W605FDO,"I love the book and just about anything by Kippling although I like ""Kim"" better.  Of course I think that no movie could do justice to the book but that is normal.  The movie is well done but a couple of animals do look a bit strange around the face when they talk.  I've watched it several times now and do like the direction as it seems to taken some of the content from the 1967 cartoon version but still has some originally as well.  What I couldn't believe was that my 3 year old would want to watch this at least once a week when there are so many other choices available to him.",1485302400,,585,4.060869565217391

7120930,4,B00W605FDO,"I purchased this movie for my 4 year old granddaughter originally but after viewing it myself (before letting her watch it) I decide that maybe it would be a tad too scary for her. Several times during the viewing it made me jump, so I know that it would be rather frightening for a 4 year old. Anyway, aside from that I loved the movie. The special effects are phenomenal and the story stays true to the classic Kipling story (with just enough minor variations to keep those who know the story interested).",1485302400,,507,4.462365591397849

7120947,5,B00W605FDO,"The original Jungle Book is one of my favorite Disney Movies, and I appreciated that although it was a live action performance with CGI animals, it still felt like I was watching a modern adaptation of the original animated movie. The actors chosen to voice the animals were perfect, and the story was entertaining for me and my family. I purchased this around black Friday for a great price, and my son has enjoyed watching the movie several times already. some of the extra scenes not shown in the original animated film were particularly entertaining, and while it wasn't exactly a ""musical"" like the original was, it still had bits and pieces from the original movie. I love this film, and highly recommend it to anyone looking to add another film to their Disney collection.",1484956800,,779,4.777777777777778

7120951,5,B00W605FDO,"This is my favorite all time Disney movie.  It's not boy gets girl.  There's no princess.  No fluff, just loveable characters that make you smile and catchy songs.  I'm 53 years old and still watch it when I'm feeling blue.  My granddaughter loves King Louie and we sing the songs together.  My whole family gets a kick out of how much I love it.

I was recently very sick.  While I was in the hospital and completely out of it, my six year old grandson brought me his Bagheera stuffed animal and put it in my bed so I wouldn't get lonely.  My cup runneth over.

Disney, you make wonderful movies but the old ones are still the best!",1484870400,15,633,4.243697478991597

Then comes the evil tiger, who for some reason wants to kill the now young lad, and the solution appears to be getting the youngster back into his human clan. Most of the video covers the adventures and dangers encountered while trying to accomplish this, as well as his eventually deciding to stay in the jungle with his wolf family.",1484784000,,513,4.410526315789474

7120962,5,B00W605FDO,I LOVED this movie and it should appeal to people of all ages. Don't expect a musical like the original Disney film. This is a live-action film that uses animation so life-like that you will swear the animals are real! Jungle Book uses some of the best 3D I have seen in a live action film with LOADS of depth and detail that transports you right into the jungle.,1484697600,,363,4.27536231884058

7120978,5,B00W605FDO,This classic is a hit with our family. Our son has loved it from age 3. Somehow the parts that might be a little scary don't bother him at all. Now his little sister is in on the fun. She's almost 2 and loves trying to dance with the elephants and sing along with Balu,1484524800,,268,3.890909090909091

7120980,5,B00W605FDO,"This was an awesome combination of video and animation.  It was a more impactful story with the use of an actual human main character, instead of a cartoon.  The story was exceptionally well presented and I've never seen a production of it that I thought was better - or, in fact, came anywhere near to this one in excellence and overall impact.  Just the right balance of everything to bring this classic story to new readers/viewers!",1484524800,,435,4.697368421052632

7120984,5,B00W605FDO,I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  It is well done and I believe was well translated from the original cartoon.  Some very young children might be surprised by some scenes since these was supposed be a 3D movie.

7120990,3,B00W605FDO,"The animation in this film is great. I love all of the actors and the voice acting, I mean they really went over the top with the cast. It's just okay for me though and doesn't really allow the actors to shine. You take some of the best actors of all time and take away their visual characteristics and you have a move with great tone, but it's not the same. I wasn't taken with it, the way that other movies move you. I didn't empathize with the characters, one because I knew the story, but also, because it's anthropomorphized to allow the animals to speak, they really left it there. In the original cartoon, the animals acted like people. In this, it was like realistic animals that could talk. Disney has a habit of releasing old films with updated graphics to sell more copies and toys now, and while I think one was a good attempt, it's just okay.",1484352000,,855,4.35

Within the first few minutes I was totally mesmerized by the stunning visual effects and back drop of the story. I wasn't sure of the choice of casting for the boy but as the movie progressed so did the young actor and his of portrayal of Mowgli. This movie is full of great surprises,with various cameo voice overs, one in particular that had a gangster style approach, which was very amusing. This adaptation takes us on a journey that reaches our hearts and souls. It is sometimes a little scary in places; so not really for the very young but it remains exceptionally beautiful throughout. I did not want the movie to end. see it, you will not be disappointed.",1484179200,2,789,4.486111111111111

7121037,2,B00W605FDO,"Havint seen the cartoon in years but im pretty sure
Monkeys/apes rasied the boy
Not wolves
Calling hes inventions tricks is stupid
And angers the animals
Ugh why? How?
Tricks are to inpress people
The kid made inventions to make things easier
Come on, so stupid
Calling fire a red flower is also stupid
Somehow the snake can use her eyes as a movie projector which makes no sense
Yet is told & he can see the tiger who killed the man in the vision yet isn't mad at all
And being told to be a wolf from a panther while human is very very stupid
A panther is a feline
A wolf is a canine
A human is a human
What would a panther know?
Come on. No logic at all

Reference level audio track. Unlike the cartoon original, Disney has remade this tale in a manner style and execution appealing to both young and old. This disk among many recent makes it worth upgrading to the new display technology of OLED, which renders eye-blinking levels of detail and blacks as deep as pitch, not to mention working alongside a dedicated sound system to create a wholly enveloping experience.",1483574400,3,577,5.020833333333333

7121061,5,B00W605FDO,"They always say that original is the best but this movie was way beyond my expectations.

Usually the animals are so fake (argghh) but this one was exceptionally brilliant and the scenes were ""off the hook""and deserves more than just a 5 star rating!!!

Mowgli is such a sweet little boy who is raised by a pack of wolves and a panther (Bagheera) in the big Jungle. I loved the portrayal of family values between man and beast. Little Grey wanting to stay by his big brother's (Mowgli's) side, Grey missing him when Mowgli decided to leave the pack - it was just heartwarming.

Then there is a drought and the truce formed between predator and prey - anyone is allowed to drink from the waterhole without having to watch your back. It is truly amazing.

Then Shere Khan's threats towards Mowgli and the pack - Mowgli leaving with Bagheera, the death of Akhila, Mowgli meeting Baloo and us seeing the most hideous humongous ape - King Louie. Mowgli saving the baby elephant was such a touching scene - he didn't have to do it but he wanted to because he is a sweet kid. I think they found the perfect kid to play the part :)

I just loved watching this movie with my family - it is adventurous, some LOL moments but most of all, it's all about going to great lengths to protect the ones we love.

7121074,5,B00W605FDO,"Brilliant film, beautiful nature, excellent acting, artistic balance, design, color, everything.  However, the last third gets WAY TOO INTENSE
for young sensitive children.  There is a lot of violence, and terrorizing energy. I wouldn't take any child under 11 or 12 to see this.  Perhaps
I'm being too protective, but I was braced (as an adult) for the last third of the movie, protecting myself from the strong visuals and sounds
that pumped adrenalin through my veins.
  I'd show the younger children the earlier cartoon version and let them mature enough to be ready to truly enjoy this one.
  My parents took me to see Fantasia as a toddler and I still remember being terrified.  I saw Wizard of Oz as a young girl, and fell asleep
in the scenes with the witches because I was too afraid.  Why imbed scary memories for your beloved babies?  I am 68 and still become
anxious at those memories and blame my parents for not being sensitive enough to protect me from those scenes.",1483315200,,981,4.684210526315789

I'm usually critical how CGI is overused in movies today, but it gave the talking animals more of a realistic  look. And the jungle scenes  looked realistic and natural. My main criticism is with the young actor playing the orphan. He lacked the ability to convey depth or  emotion. His performance was passable but I think an Indian actor with the correct dialect would have made it more convincing. Also I didn't care for the songs hijacked from the animated version. It just didn't work for me. And of course the word ""cool"" uttered by the main character sounded silly. I recommend this version, even with the flubs I mentioned.

Still not sure how Mowgli got by with just a few scratches considering how many hills, mountains and ravines he fell into and down and trees he fell out of but of course this is Disney where anything can happen.  Loved the child actor.  I would definitely watch it again and again. Very close to the cartoon movie of the same name only way more exciting.",1482451200,3,439,4.382716049382716

It's on Netflix right now. The fun music and adored characters just weren't as fun to watch like the cartoon. It was weird. The singing just sucked. Honestly they never should jave put the singing in it at all. It was bleh! Great graphics, but for story I'd rather watch the classic version.",1482192000,,467,4.318181818181818

7121207,4,B00W605FDO,"""The Jungle Book"", what can I say, it's as ambitious, fun and stunning as you might would imagine it to be. Visual effects, spectacular and some of the best I've ever seen. But at the same time, I felt like this movie benefited greatly from an old-fashioned feel. At many times in the script and personalities of the characters, save for a few lines here and there, this movie felt like a 1960's Disney movie. And that's what makes ""Jungle Book"" so fun and one of their finest live-action updates so far.

It doesn't make you cry nor does it have a deep story, but then again, neither did the animated movie. I also thought the musical numbers retained from the original weren't exactly well-executed. Overall, I still think ""Enchanted"" and ""Pete's Dragon"" are my favorite live-action Disney ""fairy tales"", but this one isn't too far behind. Definitely one to see with the whole family! :)  4.1 out of 5 stars.",1481760000,,910,4.645962732919255

7121334,5,B00W605FDO,"When I learned that Disney was remaking its animated classic ""The Jungle Book,"" my first reaction was simply ""why?""  Disney had already created a live-action remake of this movie in the '90s to mixed effect, and I didn't see any reason for them to redo this one.  It seems that live-action remakes are going to be the new thing for Disney's classics, however, what with ""Cinderella"" and ""Maleficent"" doing well financially and ""Beauty and the Beast"" gaining a lot of buzz.  I didn't want to simply hate this movie for being a remake, however, and figured I should give it a chance before writing it off.

I'm very glad I did so -- this updated version of ""The Jungle Book"" is actually quite gorgeous, with amazing visuals, fantastic voice work by an all-star cast, and a darker but still poignant and exciting story.

""The Jungle Book"" follows young Mowgli, a boy literally raised by wolves in the jungles of India.  When the tiger Shere Khan (voiced by Idris Elba) threatens Mowgli's life, the wolves send him away to be returned to the village of Man, accompanied by the panther Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) for protection.  But when disaster strikes and Mowgli and Bagheera are separated, Mowgli ends up encountering other denizens of the jungle -- the hypnotic and dangerous python Kaa (Scarlet Johannsen), the manipulative but easy-going and ultimately friendly bear Baloo (Bill Murray), and the power-hungry mobster-boss ape King Louie (Christopher Walken).  When Shere Khan threatens Mowgli's wolf family, he finds he must choose between safety with Man... or saving his friends and family from the cruelty of Khan, even if it costs him his own life.

This film is gorgeous to look at -- practically everything except Mowgli is CGI, but unlike other mostly-CGI movies (*cough the Star Wars prequels cough*) it sure doesn't look like it.  The animals are fantastically rendered, and manage to emote and speak in a human manner without falling directly into the uncanny valley.  This is especially impressive with both Baloo and King Louie, who retain something of their voice actors' expressions and mannerisms but manage to not look creepy in the process.

The voice work is also impressive, with an all-star cast that never feels jarringly out of place.  Elba is appropriately menacing as Shere Khan, and Walken brings a sinister vibe to this rendition of King Louie, who is far more mobster-boss than jazz-musician in this rendition.  Scarlett Johanssen's role as Kaa was hotly contested and, I admit, a little weird at first, but she does a good job in her role and provides a very memorable moment int he movie.

This story is darker than the original 1967 film, just as a warning -- little kids might be scared by some scenes of destruction and animal violence, though notably there's no blood.  And while it's still far closer to the ""in name only"" '60s adaptation than the original novel, it still draws from those roots and turns the cartoony tale of the original film into something epic and exciting.  And Mowgli no longer seems like a petulant child being dragged along on an adventure against his will, but a character with real growth and development who ends up making his own choices about his destiny instead of being treated like a prop.  I appreciated this immensely.

If I have any complaints about the movie, it's that it wedges two of the original films' songs in without taking care to make sure they fit.  Baloo's song, ""Bare Necessities,"" is at least somewhat justified, but King Louie's ""I Wanna Be Like You"" feels like it comes out of nowhere when it pops up.  Given the darker, more realistic tone of this film, the inclusion of the songs feels jarring and weird to me.  (We do get to hear Kaa's number ""Trust In Me"" as well, albeit over the end credits...)

An epic and exciting remake, with gorgeous visuals and excellent voice work, this film put my doubts to rest and gives me faith that Disney will handle the incoming flood of live-action remakes very well.  I just hope the upcoming remakes of films like ""The Lion King,"" ""Mulan,"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"" are just as good...  Recommended for children ages 8 and up due to violence and some dark, thematic elements.",1480464000,,4203,4.812239221140473

7121380,4,B00W605FDO,Entertaining movie that was visually pleasing but seriously flawed compared to original Disney version and close to horrible compared to the book. The CGI was amazing but the all star cast was really bad. Johansson pretty much mailed it in. it seemed like she did her part over the phone. Murray and kingsley were good but not nearly as good as they usually are. Walken was intimidating but his song was horrible and his voice is straight New York. The rest of the cast was terrible. The alpha male wolf who was feminine. And Shere Khan was scary but too English. As remakes go this it a lot closer to Godzilla and Planet of the Apes. I know they probably had to remake it eventually but they should have done a better job especially with the songs and voices.,1479600000,,760,4.474820143884892

I was enthralled in the first couple of minutes and at times was stunned to remember the animals were all CGI - the movie was absolutely stunning with seamless interaction between the only actor (Mowgli) and the special effects animals.  The actors who breathed life into the animals were amazing, they helped each character portray power, elegance or sneakiness as they needed.  I really enjoyed Bill Murray who voices Balou, he can make you fall in love with the silly scheming bear.  This was  great addition to my Disney collection.",1479427200,,657,4.581196581196581

The blending of the animation with live actor was superb. I found myself comparing it to Disney's original cartoon version and the 1994 version starring Jason Scott Lee. My expectations were high but unfulfilled. By all means, put it on your watch list, but watch it without previous versions in mind.",1479340800,,442,4.753246753246753

7121409,5,B00W605FDO,"Yes, I'm one of those people who often feels that you just can't trump my childhood memories of the ""classic original"" Disney movies with these new remakes and their over-hyped, fancy computer graphics. I even have a good rant or two concerning the ""lack of originality these days"".
But honestly? I thought this movie was great. It was beautiful to watch, the characters felt sincere and real, and the story carries you along effortlessly. I even felt that Mowgli's character was improved upon. In the original version he was quite petulant, often complaining about how unfair it was that he had to move away, despite the threat against his life. But in this version, he understood that his presence put his family in danger, and he was much more willing to step up and make sacrifices for their safety. It was emotionally engaging, and I am definitely happy to have seen it. I think you will be too!",1479254400,2,900,4.7025316455696204

Raksha, the mother wolf, played by Lupita Amondi Nyong'o, was one of my favorite characters.  She brought so much heart and soul to this movie.  I loved watching  her with her wolf cubs.

I loved Bill Murray as Baloo and the bare necessities references.  Between Bill Murray's Baloo and Christopher Walken's King Louie, I was thoroughly entertained and amused!  They were perfect for those roles!

Ben Kingsly was fantastic as Bagheera, the panther, Mowgli's mentor/protector/teacher.  He has that presence, wisdom, and dignity about him.

Scarlett Johansson as Kaa, the python, was entertaining.  I would have loved to see more of Kaa in the movie.

Idris Elba as Shere Khan was fierce and frightening!  You could certainly feel that sense of threat!",1478476800,4,973,5.056962025316456

The movie was engrossing from the get go and the CGI really made the animals into wonderful characters who seemed like real talking animals.  Songs were kept to a bare minimum and the action was intense from start to finish.

7121596,5,B00W605FDO,"Disney has been doing quite well with their live-action movies such as Maleficent and Alice In Wonderland. CGI has gotten so good that it can look absolutely real. This is used to good effect in Disney's ""The Jungle Book"", a remake of their popular 1967 film. The animation is superb, and the actors who provide voices for the various animals are very well chosen. Ben Kingsley is properly dignified and intellectual as the panther who watches over Mowgli, and Bill Murray is entertaining as the lazy and scheming, but loyal bear. Scarlett Johanssen provides the seductive voice for the python, and Christopher Walken is the voice of the leader of the apes, who rules them like a crime boss. The young boy who plays Mowgli is the only real human to appear on screen, except for a flashback which also briefly shows his father.

The story is a lot darker than the old cartoon version, and we understand why Shere Khan the tiger hates Mowgli so much. The moments when Mowgli is in the clutches of the python or the apes are appropriately exciting and terrifying. There are also a few lighthearted moments, and 3 of the songs from the older version have been updated and show up at least for a verse or two. One scene made me laugh out loud when Mowgli is led into the ruined city to meet the head ape. He notices a pile of rusty objects on the ground and picks up something....I won't spoil it by identifying what it is, but it was a perfect moment.",1477958400,5,1447,4.501901140684411

7121605,5,B00W605FDO,"This move is awesome! Effects are great as are the voices from the actors and actresses. This isn't the original and has a new twist, but it's a well done real life remake.",1477872000,,172,4.242424242424242

7121608,5,B00W605FDO,"Amazing, beautiful 21st-century storytelling and artistry.  A little too scary for very young children, but a delight for school age and up - including grownups.  Bill Murray's one liners alone are well worth it.",1477785600,,212,5.205882352941177

7121612,5,B00W605FDO,I am not sure i know how to say how much we (4 boys ranging from 8-1 and my hubby and i) LOVED this movie. We have read the story a billion times and of course every rendition of the movie... This is by far the best and will be watched again and again.  We fell in love with mowgli and baloo and bagheera and of course the best mommy wolf there ever was. And we hated the wretched shere khan. They were so very very well done! Loved it!!!,1477785600,2,438,3.8666666666666667

7121616,5,B00W605FDO,I've always loved the 1942 Alexander Korda Technicolor version of JUNGLE BOOK with Sabu. This 2016 Disney version is a marvel to experience and a must have on Blu-ray. The world created for this film is something else and the animals are just real enough to make the world of Rudyard Kipling to work. Loved the Extras on this one as well. If this is a film that you care for then you don't anyone suggesting a purchase of this title. A beautifully done film with a perfect Blu-ray transfer.,1477699200,2,490,4.455555555555556

7121619,3,B00W605FDO,"I attempted to watch this, twice, but couldn't make it through. It comes down to being extremely attached to and fond of the original; I admit to being unable to give the new version a chance. Visually, it is stunning; it just doesn't have the heart of the original. The way they have drastically switched up the characters is disconcerting as well. One example is Kaa being a female. Kaa in the original, so perfectly voiced by Sterling Holloway, has no equal as it is. Switching 'him' to a female?? WHY???

There are certain original films that are so completely perfect, just the way they are, there should be a law against 're-making' them. The Little Mermaid, E.T., The Wizard of Oz, all of The Toy Story films, and certainly The Jungle Book.",1477699200,,747,4.616541353383458

7121627,4,B00W605FDO,Watched and enjoyed this movie about a month ago. Great visual effects. Classic story. And forget most of the details. Felt I had to see as it is a classic. Not overly memorable. Kids may want to watch it over and over again. David Bowie's Labyrinth was a good one for the kids. Over and over again....I loved it for maybe 3x.,1477612800,,326,4.274193548387097

7121786,5,B00W605FDO,"Specifically in this ""Limited Issue"" DVD, you can see the entire 4:3 ratio of the film. It wasn't shot in widescreen, sometimes Disney would produce features in 4:3 and crop the top & bottom for widescreen theaters. The ""Platinum Edition"" does this widescreen cropping, and it is very noticeable that you're missing imagery from the top & bottom of the film (see attached photo comparison.) I own both editions now, since each has its own enjoyable features, but this is the only version where you can see the entire film.",1476835200,25,522,4.811111111111111
7121787,3,B00W605FDO,"I have revised my rating to 3 stars from 4... something I've never taken the time or felt the need to in the past. Since I usually never even write movie reviews I'll try to keep it short as this change does at least require an explanation. I, like most others, initially thought the movie had done a very good job of telling the beloved Kipling tale with some much needed new zest and a variety of great voices lending their talents to this wonderful idea of a project. I know that the new little kid deserves a break as it was his first real opportunity to act. AND having to do it to a blue screen surely cannot be easily tackled by a child.
Bottom line is that the animals look great. Murray and Walken step up to deliver the goods. But all the other big names, with maybe the exception of Sir Ben, kinda fell a little flat.
If I were to watch it again for the first time I'd probably give it 4 stars again. But, and here's the kicker, nobody seems to want to be at all critical of the movie's low points. I wanted so badly to give this 5 stars as I had read so many positive reviews that I felt my initial criticisms would have been too harsh. But, having watched the film more than twice now I can honestly say that people are being just a little too kind to this one.
So there you have it. Take it with a grain of salt. But you can't say that at least someone on Amazon didn't speak-up and be a bit more critical than a 6 year old would be.
On a lighter note... go ahead and watch it! Enjoy it!! And make up your own mind in the end. At the very least, it is most certainly worth your time.",1476748800,,1597,4.0251572327044025

The boy was cute and did a decent job but I just couldn't get past some of the differences. For instance the snake, Kaa, was a big disappointment for me. The voice in the original movie was perfect and Kaa was funny too. The newer version of Kaa was way too serious and I did not like the voice at all.

I was captivated by the CGI in this film and I especially appreciated the twist on the first animated Disney Jungle Book.

Maybe 3 notches. It took me 7-8 sessions of various minutes to finish. I really hope The Lion King will be better, MUCH better.

Old, dull, bitterly dull.  The wise old Shakespearean English man.  The strength of the pack is the wolf and the strength of the wolf is the pack.  Maybe I'm just too old at age 57 to appreciate another rendition of remakes, but that's a lot of what comes out of the movie industry.  Remake after remake, prequels, sequels.  They are boasted as the most creative people among us, yet they rely on same old themes, same old actors, same old stereotypes, same ol' same ol'.  Yes, the graphics were terrific, and that's one of the reasons I have a 4k screen, but I I still yearn for something new and something creative beyond what computers these days can do.",1476144000,,822,4.523809523809524

7121939,2,B00W605FDO,"I am an adult who watched the original Jungle Book although it was up to date with technology the story for adults is rather boring. The young actor in it has no emotion when conveying anger, fear, confusion etc . He looks like the boy from the Jungle book but he is a terrible actor. He often speaks to the animals in a way you can imagine a puppet being there with the visual effects crew saying pretend it's a wolf , tiger etc. It has a few good visual effect moments although I find the animals that are the main characters unrealistic  . It may be good for children who have never seen the original so I added a star to my one star. Louie and the monkeys scene was probably the highlight of the movie with the best visually. My boyfriend fell asleep 2/3 into the movie and I found myself glancing around the room during a few scenes.

7121964,3,B00W605FDO,"Not a bad rendition, but I had read so much about the fantastic CGI that I suppose I was bound to be disappointed.  Some of the animals, to me, looked very ""wooden"", stiff and not sufficiently lifelike.

The highlight for me was Val Walken's King Louie singing I Wanna Be Like You.  If that was him singing, he did a great job.  His voice is unusual enough that it made it twice as interesting.",1475884800,,394,4.283783783783784

7121968,5,B00W605FDO,"This is a fine movie.  Reasonable adaptation of the Disney classic.  An intermediate number of changes from the cartoon making it somewhat more serious, but not inappropriate for a family.  Great job with all the green-screen work.

My only real issue with this is the voice acting.  It's not B grade or anything but they appear to have gone for very big name actors instead of actors that specialize in interesting voices.  Example: Scarlett Johansson.  Great actress, but not particularly noted for having an interesting voice.  And it really showed.  I don't think her voice worked well with the animation, nor was it very interesting.  Same thing with Bill Murray.  I think his visual acting is what makes him great, not his voice.  He was better, but by no means special.

Anyway, good movie and I recommend it.",1475884800,,816,4.826086956521739

The star character of the movie (so the one we're watching and paying attention to for the length of this feature), a kid supposedly raised in the jungle, acts like a dimwit kid that might've be raised by very passive parents then thrown in the jungle for a few days. This dichotomy draws itself through the movie and causes one annoyance after another.

You want a fun, well-written movie for the kids AND adults? Check out Zootopia. You watched that already? Watch it again. That's how bad this movie is. If my kids didn't have toys to distract them mid movie they'd probably happily go to bed instead.",1475884800,2,804,4.389261744966443

Animation and live action filming have truly advanced to a remarkable level.  Kipling wrote of the jungle and its harsh ways, but in a manner that has captured the imaginations of countless children since it was first published and this rendition by Disney is a superior effort at bringing his story to the screen.  The story, whether the original as inked by Kipling or this movie version, is not all sweetness and light, there is darkness, terror, and loss of life, but it is handled very well and I think the movie is, overall, a grand effort.",1475539200,,650,4.538461538461538

7122073,5,B00W605FDO,"Wonderful depiction of the Rudyard Kipling classic. A mixture of animation and actual performers, you will be enchanted by this new Disney classic. Unlike the original Disney animated movie from the 1960s, this version doesn't sugar-coat the scary parts, so it may be too violent for very young or sensitive children.",1475452800,,317,5.235294117647059

7122082,3,B00W605FDO,"It was okay, because it was okay. Bill Murray was an incredible Blu, the supporting cast as animals were exceptionally well done, however Mowli didn't sell it for me and a movie with this much potential needed to blow it out of the park, but it was a triple and not a home run.

7122095,5,B00W605FDO,"Super realistic CG. I thought the opening scene was real vegetation, only to learn the entire film is superb CG with only the live boy and the green/blue screens. I have seen ALL of the ""Jungle Books"" on the big screne, including the first with Sabu and a live tiger, followed some years later by the classic Disney animation. This is by far CG beyond reality. The Dolby 7.1 sound was flawless. In my opinion, one of the best films of the year in entertainment value, suspense, acting (voices), and action.

I'm not into kids' animation movies, but this successfully plays to an adult audience.

I've already watched it three times.

The Special section explores the making of the movie, with eye opening information.",1475452800,2,717,4.766129032258065

7122101,5,B00W605FDO,"Personally I was not that excited for this movie nor had I ever seen the original Jungle Book animated film (I know, my bad) but knowing the talent involved and because my 4 year old son wanted to see it, we actually went to this film in theaters and boy was it a treat. The Visual effects are top notch and would not surprise me if it won the oscar for this year. The pacing is great, the story is decent, its heart warming funny and adventurous. The special features on the disc are okay, one real good featurette about the making of the film.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jungle-Book-BD-DVD-Digital-HD-Blu-ray/dp/B01CTNDO58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jungle Book (BD + DVD + Digital HD) [Blu-ray</a>]",1475452800,,757,5.478632478632479

This one was just different enough from the original Disney animation that it was like visiting an old friend, but also kept your attention. I saw it in Imax 3-D the day it opened, and knew immediately I'd be adding it to my collection. Scarlett Johansen as the snake was a bit of a surprise, though... but again, just different enough that you didn't feel you were watching the same old movie yet again.",1475366400,,447,4.463414634146342

7122113,5,B00W605FDO,"I was worried this movie would not do the cartoon justice, and I had nothing to worry about. Neel Sethi was excellent as Mowgli. The the voices of the other characters were really good. I couldn't tell that they did most of it without actually sending the actors on location, it's amazing what they can do with CG.
The story was really good, i actually liked it better than the original cartoon.
The extras were good too.
Jon Favreau (Stark Industries ""forehead of security"" - Iron Man 3) is a great director. If you watch the extras, you will see how he was very hands on with Neel Sethi and how he tried to stay true to the cartoon as much as possible.
This is a must have in any Disney collection, hopefully they will release the Blu-ray 3D soon so i can buy it again ;) or at least a UK version like I had to buy Frozen 3D.",1475366400,,827,4.175

I took my 4 year old, 7 year old, and my 8 year old grand children to see this movie when it was first released. They were thoroughly entertained, and obviously afraid and and excited during the scarier moments of the this wonderful film. The parents and adults will have to make their own judgement as to weather their children can few this movie, because of the scarier parts throughout the movie. I know my grand children were not reporting any nightmares after viewing this outstanding Disney movie. In fact my daughter took them again a few months later to see it on the big screen, and again they enjoyed it.

There was no real plot; most of the story, Mowgli is functionally an item that gets passed from hand to hand (or paw to paw). In Kipling's story, Mowgli succeeds because he embraces both of the worlds he lives in: that of the wolves and that of Man. Here, he has to reject one and embrace the other, setting the entire jungle on fire along the way. Overall, I found it disappointing.",1474848000,2,523,4.515789473684211

7122296,3,B00W605FDO,"As far as movies go, this is one that is beautifully done with its special effects and landscapes.  The animals look as real as I have seen in any movie to date, well except for the talking part of course. Having been familiar with the remakes and the original book, there are no surprises here for me and I thought the story was done well, although not quite the same as the original story that I remember.  I as an adult didn't find this to be as entertaining as other Disney based family movies but the original Jungle Book has never been one of my favorites to begin with.  I can see how children will find this fun and entertaining though and although I don't see it as a favorite movie for me personally, I did find it entertaining and fun to watch, just for the beautifully done effects alone.  I did find the singing moments a bit annoying and distracting to the movie, especially with Walkens singing in the second half of the movie.

It is worth watching for the CGI alone but for those you like the classic story, this may fall a bit short in that respect.

Some had diminished rolls and others changed from male to female.  I will leave it at a vague review since I don't want to spoil it for others but both of my girls were glued to the TV and that says a lot since my oldest is Autistic and has an attention span of a housefly! It held her attention from beginning to end! Mine as well! Great Movie!

7122443,5,B00W605FDO,"Absolutely loved this movie. Disney did an incredible job, paying homage to the animated version without creating a carbon copy. The effects are gorgeous, and this will be a movie I watch over and over.",1474329600,,202,4.8

7122449,3,B00W605FDO,Meh. Why does Disney mess around with the classics? I thought some of the voices were horribly miscast. I dunno. Meh.,1474329600,,117,4.619047619047619
7122450,5,B00W605FDO,"Jaw-dropping from beginning to end. As a lover of the original cartoon and its ""I'm the king of the swingers"" and ""Bear Necessities"" and the initiation as a child to what true friendship actually looks like, I found  myself watching this live action version like I was watching the story for the first time. All the while, remembering each moment from the cartoon and praying and hoping that they'd recreate it.

The voice acting is top notch and the beautiful creations of the characters and animals could have so easily been a distraction and never was. Scarlett Johansson's Kaa was a highlight for me but Idris Elba's Shere Kahn was off the chain brilliant. The danger that his voice and the brilliant CGI work gets across to the audience makes the film. Nothing makes a great film like a great villain and this may be one of the best film villains of all time.

This movie is an instant classic on top of a prior classic and it will ensure that the love of this story will continue for ages. There's power in numbers, there's power in bravery and there's power in friendship. Grab the 3d version from the U.K. and immerse yourself in this gem of a film.",1474329600,,1157,4.526315789473684

I agree with people who have said they're glad they rented it before buying.  Wish I had done the same.  While this rendition is much closer to Kipling's Jungle Book which I loved as a kid, I definitely would not show this movie to children.  I admired the animation.  That's about the only good thing I can say about it.  Mowgli's acting was more like a kid in a grammar school stage play.  The scenes with King Louie were especially too intense for kids, as was the tiger's death scene.  As an adult, I found it uninteresting and a bit dismal to watch all the way through even one time,  and I'll go back to the original animated version if I want to watch it again.

Side note:
I find it hard to believe that the UK market sells more 3D blu rays than the entire United States.  It appears that Disney may be pushing to end the market of 3d here in the states. Without sufficient choices of content to help the market grow, there is no other place for it to go but in demise.
For instance, imagine buying Avatar in 3d when it first was released.  There were no other movies available.  Why in the world would anyone purchase a 3d tv and player to play just one movie? The industry has been waiting for the demand without offering supply ---that's just insane.",1473811200,,768,4.3125
7122625,4,B00W605FDO,"I want to start off by saying I am not a Jungle Book purist, but I am a fan of the book and I don't feel that any adaptation has been THE ONE yet. That said I loved this movie! It was fun, the world was vibrant and lush and it felt alive and ancient, the voice acting was phenomenal, Neel Sethi did a great job as Mowgli (Even if he did shout his lines worse than Dora and Diego combined), and I loved the edginess they added to the film.

But this is the internet and I am a critic so it can't be all sunshine and rainbows. The few things that don't work are Scarlett Johansson's Kaa and Giancarlo Esposito's Akela. Both of these characters feel underdeveloped. Also the message of the film is muddled.

Kaa is only there to provide flashback exposition. In the books Kaa is all over the place assisting Mowgli and friends (and trying to eat him) Heck even the Jason Scott Lee version had him as a fearsome foe, in this she appears gives some exposition and then fight Baloo off screen. Seems like a waste of an A-list actress.

Akela, likewise doesn't have a lot of screen time. In the books he is Mowgli's great defender, Shere Kahn needs a whole pack of young wolves to try to depose him and his connection to Mowgli is so strong that when he eventually dies it is the driving force for Mowgli to leave the jungle for good. In the film he isn't given enough interactions with Mowgli to form a strong connection,and thus the audience as an extension of Mowgli, we miss out on what could've been a strong paternal character.

Lastly the message of the film seems to warn of the dangers of man's use of fire and the animals fear of it's destructive power...but like in the 1967 version it is used and the destruction is kinda glossed over and there is no consequence to Mowgli for using it.  I feel like his use of the Red Flower is the final litchpin in seperating him from his jungle brethren and transitioning him to humanity...but in this it is a means to an end and really nothing is learned from it. Also there is one throw away line by Lupita Nyong'o's Raksha that seems to hint at Shere Khan breaking the law of the jungle by Killing for pleasure but this is not really fleshed out.

The bottom line is this is a fun movie with lots of heart. The CGI is incredible, the actors are amazing, and the world is teeming with life. It's not a perfect adaptation but it's a helluva tale to spin.",1473811200,,2397,4.2687224669603525

7122627,4,B00W605FDO,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Lets face it, the name Disney on nearly any movie means quality and something that children will flock to. And when you take a well-known Disney film and remake it the odds are in your favor that it will be a hit. You would have to seriously mess things up for it to fail. Thankfully director Jon Favreau didn't do that and has turned in a well done reworking of the classic animated Disney film THE JUNGLE BOOK.

Based in the novel by Rudyard Kipling both versions have strayed a bit from the original source. If youve ever tried to read Kipling youll understand why and give them a pass on this. While the story structure and deep rooted tale remain, just how it is told changes. And while the original Disney film was standard cell animation, this time around we are blessed with the most amazing computer animation there is to offer.

The story itself revolves around a young boy, a human, named Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who was found in the forest of India, taken to a pack of wolves to be raised by his now guardian a black panther named Bagheera (the voice of Ben Kingsley) and who now faces a new danger. With a dry spell in the area a water truce is called among the animals with none allowed to kill another during this draught.

But as they all gather around the nearest watering hole they are surprised by the appearance of Shere Khan (the voice of Idris Elba), a man killing tiger scarred by his last encounter with a human, a human who happened to be Mowglis father. Shere Khan follows the pact for the water truce but warns the animals that when the waters rise once again he will return for the boy.

As the weather changes and the waters rise the wolf pack discusses what they should do about Mowgli. It is Mowgli himself who decides he must leave. Bagheera agrees and so begins the trek of these two to take Mowgli back to the land of men. Adventures follow the pair beginning with an attack by Shere Khan resulting in a slim escape by Mowgli.

Separated from Bagheera Mowgli soon makes friends with a conniving bear named Baloo (the voice of Bill Murray) who enlists his help in bringing down a number of honey combs. When Bagheera shows he scolds the pair and starts the journey with Mowgli again only to have him taken away by a group of monkeys led by King Louie (the voice of Christopher Walken) who wants Mowgli to show him the secret of mans red flower aka fire.

The story carries on and eventually a resolution to the conflict of Shere Khan and Mowgli will bring about the end of the film. That Mowglis friends all become involved is a given. But will they be willing to lay down their lives for this man-cub? Will they consider him the boy theyve loved all these years or will they see him as a growing young man who will present danger to their world?

The movie is a fantastic combination of story and technology that work hand in hand to present the tale in the best way possible. Rather than shoot in an actual jungle the entire production was shot on sound stages equipped with blue screens meaning that while the entire movie takes place in a jungle they were never once in an actual jungle. Not only are the characters computer animated characters but the entire setting is done this way. To combine all of these together is a near impossible task, especially when it comes to the use of shadows. And yet they did it and did it well.

Not only are we presented with this grand vision we also find ourselves wrapped up in this coming of age story about Mowgli. So many things could have gone wrong. The actor playing Mowgli could have been terrible. The animation could have been off. The voice actors could have been the worst choices possible. Instead the right combination of elements comes together here for a jewel of a movie to be added to the Disney crown.

It should also be noted that this film is less of a musical effort than the original. But never fear because at least two songs do appear, the main two that could have spelled disaster had they not been included. Yes The Bear Necessities and I Wanna Be Like You are both hear. Plan on hearing your children singing the songs around the house for the next few weeks.

This is one of those films that anyone with children need to add to their collection. Disney fans need to do the same. And if you enjoy a well-made and entertaining film then youll want a copy as well. It satisfies on all levels.",1473811200,,4446,4.403166869671133

7122630,3,B00W605FDO,"Okay.  I have to start off with the positives with this movie.  The animation is excellent.  Its catchy at times but that about it.
Mowgli seems a bit disconnected from his character, sort of as if his lines are a tad boxey.  What I mean is there isn't really any empathism in his voice, its at times he is bored with his character.  The movie is also dull at times.
I did read other reviews of the movie being a bit violent at times and thought ""but its the jungle book"".  They were right to an extent.  (Without ruining anything) the part on wolf rock was a tad violent but very ahort.  I would recommend renting this movie first so that you could make your own opinion though.",1473811200,,679,4.25

I prefer the original Disney classic, but I'm quite pleased with this live action remake (and I didn't think I would be as most of them have been terrible).

Can't believe I rented this considering I'm a middle aged woman with no grandchildren to justify my watching it.  lol
I wasn't able to watch it on HD on my computer for some reason so the clarity wasn't the greatest but despite that, I absolutely loved the personalities, expressions and emotions of the actors who were doing the voices as it really brought life to their characters. (Of course my favorite was Bill Murray)
Fabulous job!

We watched Jungle Book with Phil Harris as voice of Baloo so many times and that booming bass voice just became associated with Baloo.

7122692,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book, one of Disney's ultimate classics, it has great characters, an awesome story and terrific animation. I'll admit it, I adore Disney movies, I could never choose just one Disney movie as my favorite, I love them all for so many different reasons. The Jungle Book is one of my fav's though, after buying the new release on DVD, I realized that I love this movie now more than ever. The reason that I think this movie is so wonderful is because of the characters, they just brought so much life to the story and really made this into a wonderful Disney classic.

Mowgli is found in a basket as a baby in the deep jungles. Bagheera, the panther who discovers the boy, promptly takes him to a wolf who has just had cubs. She raises him along with her own cubs and Mowgli soon becomes well acquainted to jungle life. Mowgli is shown ten years later, visiting the wolves and getting his face licked eagerly when he arrives. That night, when the wolf tribe learns that Shere Khan, a man-eating tiger, has returned to the jungle, they realize that Mowgli must be taken to the man village, to protect him and those around him. Bagheera volunteers to escort him back. They leave that very night, but Mowgli is determined to stay in the jungle and loses Bagheera. Kaa, the hungry python, hypnotizes Mowgli into a deep and peaceful sleep, traps him tightly in his coils, and tries to devour him, but comically fails. The next morning, Mowgli tries to join the elephant patrol. Bagheera finds Mowgli and they argue; Mowgli runs away from Bagheera. The boy soon meets up with the fun-loving bear Baloo, who shows Mowgli the fun of having a care-free life and promises not to take him to the man village. Mowgli now wants to stay in the jungle more than ever. Shere Khan is after Mawgli though and won't rest 'till he kills him.

Seriously, these are some of the most memorable characters in Disney history, we have Baloo, the care free party bear that just wants to have fun and only needs the ""bear"" necessities of life. Begheera, a panther, that we've all known this kind of person, the one that just wants to get down to business and get as much done as quickly as possible, the party pooper, but deep down still has that heart. And one of Disney's most memorable villains of all time, Shere Khan, voiced by George Sanders, classy, sassy, menacing and vicious, I wouldn't be surprised if he was Scar's inspiration(the lion villain in The Lion King). If you haven't seen The Jungle Book, just buy it, believe me, it's worth the money. It's a classic fun animated film that I will love forever, still to this day I will always sing along to Bear Necessities, it's a good time.

7122865,1,B00W605FDO,"Meh. That's my overall feeling about this movie. I was so looking forward to it - The Jungle Book (animated) was one of my favorite childhood movies. But instead of feeling like a linked story, cohesive and total, this felt like a series of vignettes. Nothing had any urgency, there was no sense of tension or drama. Characters came and went, never to appear again. Even Shere Khan barely had a significant role.

I'm glad I rented it instead of going with my first instinct and buying it.",1473465600,7,489,4.556818181818182

7122875,4,B00W605FDO,"story was awesome, the CGI is on a level above everything else.  sticks very well to the beloved 1967 Disney story plus characters cut out of that version.  Animal roles taken on by very accomplished actors. 2 of the best Disney songs of all time preserved.  In every way an astronomical production!!!
One problem- the story is racked with cliche after cliche:  the ""I-killed-your-father"" taunt, the ""why didn't you tell me?"" heel turn & the chanting rhetoric as you team up at the end are among the biggest detractors.  Always shakes away the illusion of a great story.  5 stars turned to 3 for constant overuse- like hiding sandpaper in silk.
Had to add back a star because I just could give it a 3, but GOD I hate cliches.  Man, if you're a good writet for a great producer you can do A LOT LOT LOT better.",1473465600,,809,4.425675675675675

It has differences from those that came before it while remaining true to the story. The CGI production of the animals is amazing but too often it doesn't look real. That was a distraction for me.

The 2016 version of The Jungle Book is such a good movie, a really fine rendition of Kipling's story--until the Gigantopithicus sings.  The song sequence is so out of place, so distracting, so grating, so completely at odds with the tone of the film up to that point, that it ruins the rest of the movie .  Best guess, it was supposed to be a kind of homage to Disney's animated version, but  why anyone would have wanted to do that is beyond comprehension.

All of the animals looked like they came straight out of the jungle.  It did not matter to me but I think it was a great idea that they shortened this movie a bit.  I remember taking small children to movies so many years ago and no matter how much they liked the movie, they got antsy about thirty minutes before it was over.

7122957,5,B00W605FDO,"When I was young, I always begged my grandmother to read me stories from  her copy of The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. I wanted to live in the jungle with those talking animals for friends. Walt Disney produced an animated version in 1967 that had music and comedy as the focus. And for the time, it was good.

But, director Jon Favreau's version of The Jungle Book  has just released on Blu-ray and DVD for home viewing - and I have to say - it is absolutely fantastic!

Favreau has employed 'live-action' filming. It is miles beyond that '67 version. You'd swear that the animals were real, yet the only 'real' actor is Mowgli - played by Neel Sethi. (His journey to being cast and his time on set is one of the special features) The all-star cast includes Bill Murray as the voice of Baloo, Sir Ben Kingsley as Bagheera and Lupita Nyongo as the voice of mother wolf Raksha. Scarlett Johansson gives life to Kaa, Giancarlo Esposito  provides the voice of alpha-male wolf Akela, Idris Elba roars as the voice of Shere Khan, and Christopher Walken. These voices were absolutely perfect for each character. I have to say I probably enjoyed Baloo the most.

Favreau has stayed very close to the stories I remember. Even though I knew what would happen, I found myself caught up in the story, crying for the wolves, frightened of Kaa and Shere Khan and protected by Bagheera and Baloo. He's also included music from the '67 version. Walken's King Louie song is priceless. But my fave is Baloo's The Bear Necessities. Again, I can't stress how good the graphics are - check out the trailer below to see for yourself. The bonus features are great, giving you a look at behind the scenes. This new version is a wonderful tribute to Kipling's stories. Just excellent for this viewer.

This is a family film with a few caveats - there is a death and some danger. I'll be sharing the stories and movie with my grandson when he's a few years older. Until then, I am so happy to have this in my DVD library - I can still dream of living in the jungle with talking animals for family!",1473292800,,2075,4.473544973544974
7122958,5,B00W605FDO,"I have never liked the Jungle Book. It has been one of those movies I've had to watch as a kid and never liked. Sure I liked the songs and had the cassette tape but the movie was never for me. Remakes growing up were not great and I was never interested. I saw the preview for this earlier this year and thought that it looked different, interesting, dark but fun...So I finally after months gave it a try. My family and I set up in the living room and on it went. From the beginning I was hooked! The animals looked so real and the little boy was very likeable. The voices all fit and my favorite was Baloo, Bill Murray. It was such a great movie and I didn't want it to end. It completely changed my views on the Jungle Book and quickly shot up to the top of my favorites list. My kids really liked it as well and my 9 year old son who never sits down long enough to watch a movie stayed the whole time and was extremely interested. This is worth the rent/buy. I bought because we watch it over and over again.",1473292800,5,1012,4.039800995024875

7123009,3,B00W605FDO,"As far as Disney's current penchant for reimagining their classic, animated films in live-action I gotta say ""Jungle Book"" coulda been way worse but on the other hand it's no ""Cinderella"" (which was excellent BTW).

The Pros: a child star in Neel Sethi who can not only act but when you consider this is pretty much a one-kid show in front of a green screen you gotta give him props.  The CGI characters are all excellently rendered and the sets gorgeous.  Treats the 1967 film with obvious respect while not coming off as soulless, opportunistic nostalgia.

The Cons:  Who in the hell thought casting Christopher Walken as King Louis was a good idea? I was literally squirming in my seat and wanted desperately to fast forward when he sang ""I wanna be like you"".  Oh, and not really sure why they morphed King Louis into King Kong... Kipling's book took place in India's precolonial past not the frigg'n Pleistocene.  It's obvioius Hollywood can't get enough of Scarlett Johanssen but as a voice actor she's about as lifeless as a lump of coal (her singing on the other hand...).  And finally what is it with Idris Elba, just being British doesn't automatically make you a shoe-in for Shere Khan but apparently every director in the industry has a hardon for this guy.  Not saying he's a bad actor, just every time you go to the movies these days there he is; I'm surprised they didn't cast him as Mowgli as well... then it could've been The Elba Book... I'm sure the critics would've spazgasmed over that one... probably would've said something like ""a fresh and exciting spin on an old classic for a new generation"".

Look, I get that Disney movies are high profile but I wish they'd stop with the name dropping already, nobody's impressed... Robin Williams as the genie in Aladdin was an exception not the rule.  Final Analysis: Rent before you buy. :o)",1473206400,5,1857,4.683076923076923

I may be a dinosaur at nearly 70 years old; however, I believe that parts of the movie would be frightening to the point of traumatic to very young children. I did mention that I was old, right?

7123165,4,B00W605FDO,"I was slightly less than impressed with this movie. The pros were by far the CG animals. Very cool and looked real. The jungle was amazing and the story was good. The Cons were first and foremost the acting of Mowgli. He was very annoying and there were a couple of scenes where I felt like ""feed him to the tiger already!"" He had this slight brooklyn accent and exagerated mannerisms that were very distracting. Also I found the story choppy. I would have loved more scenes with Kaa and the pack and him as an infant, and less with him wandering around the jungle eating fruit . Overall it was good, but not as great as it could or should have been.",1473206400,,650,4.2926829268292686

The animals are animated, and speak, but you accept this because of the utmost care and perfection of each individual character.

7123174,5,B00W605FDO,"This is a visually stunning, fabulous movie!  Watched it as a family, ages 10 through 61, and everyone enjoyed it.  There are a few scenes that may be a bit scary for a very small child, mainly large sinister animals well voice-acted to bring them to life. I'm not usually much for special effects, I'll take a good story any day over extensive animation/computer effects.  In this movie, however, the effects are gorgeous animals, so it's a fantasy trip worth taking.  Little Mowgli is perfect in his role as a child beginning to learn who he is and becoming his own true self - not one or the other of his ""sides"".  Great music, with key Jungle Book songs sung by Bill Murray and Christopher Walken of all people.  The latter could have used a little more cowbell, but a great job nonetheless:-) Buy and watch, you won't be disappointed!",1473120000,,839,4.56

7123187,3,B00W605FDO,"If you're looking to choose between buying the new CGI movie and the fully animated Disney film from '67, I would say the old movie wins hands down in almost every respect.
The original is pretty much a classic Disney film in its usual style (note this wasn't the first Jungle Book either... there was a 1937 film ""Elephant Boy"" and also a 1942 movie with live actors, but these were not by Disney and with far less on the animal side).

Jungle Book '67 was loaded with clever humour and one-liners, memorable songs, excellent voiceovers and strangely enough imo, the 'actors' in the animated show more range of emotion and facial expression than the new computer animals, even down to Mowgli a real human, who really was one of the better parts of the '16 film.
What's good about the new movie?  Well the special effects are excellent. King Louie was quite amazing, Baloo the bear was humorous, basically Bill Murray in bear form and well rendered... KAA the snake was cool, etc.  Most of the humour was in the backup animals having goofy voices, which is an old standby now in the newer CGI films.  Interestingly enough Jim Henson's famous muppets were brought in to act with the human cast members, though they never even appeared in the film itself this time, which shows how bad things have gotten for puppeteers in the film industry.  Disney also gets credit for not making the new movie basically an 'improved' carbon copy rewrite of their original, there's enough of a difference between the two films to make owning both worth it.
So in short if you're collecting Jungle Books, this is a worthy addition.  If you're choosing, my vote goes for the older version.",1473120000,,1670,4.663265306122449

7123192,3,B00W605FDO,"I don't generally review movies or music because I know they are larger a thing of personal preference as to whether or not it's enjoyed or hated, but this one I was genuinely disappointed with. I was hoping for a ""live action"" version of this film. It's one live action person in the character of Mowgli and a bunch of CGI animals that follow him around. The animals are all voiced by great actors and, in that respect, it does save the film to a certain extent. My main complaint is with Neel Sethi (the actor who plays Mowgli). In my opinion, if you are going to put the entire film on the shoulders of a child to carry it, you had better bust your butt to make sure that kid is AMAZING. This kid, not so much. His performance just fell flat and came across as more whiny than courageous and independent. That being said, there are several upsides to this film. While I'm not a fan of using CGI animals in general, they are very well done and the scenery is beautiful. It's overall an ok film but not something I would recommend or buy again.",1473120000,,1045,4.282828282828283

7123285,5,B00W605FDO,"I think if Walt Disney would have been pleased with this format of this GREAT classic.  He brought to life for us old doggies in the 60's and maybe 70's.  For our little ones who follow thier visual bright, vivid, musical and a story line they can follow has given it to them, also us old foggies who are still kids at heart.
My only critic, Balleu reminded me of another cuddly bear(Winney).  However, I don't remember Whinney conning Christopher Robbins to get his honey (LOL).  I didn't know Christopher Walkins sang jazz, he's no Louie Armstrong, but he's really good none the less.
GREAT CAST!!!",1473033600,,600,4.632075471698113

It pains me to say this but using the voice of Christopher Walken, Bill Murry, and Scarlett Johansson  was way off base. Baloo definitely had that Bill Murry wit but this wasn't Stripes and Baloo's voice was just off for the character. The same for King Louie, and Kaa.",1472947200,,327,4.7368421052631575

I also didn't like the fact that they made Kaa female. I thought it was their way of westernizing the story by having a more witch like character than a mystic like character but it just felt like they were doing it because of some feminist agenda. The elephants were way over the top and so was Mowgli's intelligence, no kid could engineer an entire pulley system.

7123314,3,B00W605FDO,"As someone who remembers the late 60's version, I can only offer three stars. The animation is significantly better than in the original movie as it is expected to be. And although the movie adheres to the original storyline for the most part, the ending is rewritten in a way that significantly devalues the entire theme.  Before: man-cub grows up, discovers the opposite sex, enters village, presumably raises a family and becomes a productive part of society.  Now: man-cub has a ""failure to launch"", reclines on his couch... er... tree branch, lives happily ever after doing nothing , all while letting the jungle support him.",1472947200,,630,4.9904761904761905

Some of them were very good, while others were less than mediocre. This Jungle Book was, without qualification, the best I've seen. Idris Elba was menacing as Shere Khan, Giancarlo Esposito was a kind and caring father as Akela, Ben Kingsley as Bagheera was an understanding and courageous guide to the wonderful Mowgli, Neel Sethi, and Bill Murray gave Balloo a new layer of humor. This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy. If the book is filmed again, which it probably will be, the producers would need to go a long way to create a version that would be remotely close to this one.",1472947200,4,708,4.626984126984127

If you enjoy 3D, that is the version to get for your collection.  Just remember that the Disney rewards code doesn't count for US account holders, which is a bummer.

7123384,2,B00W605FDO,"Not what I was hoping for based on all the rave reviews. Needless to say this doesn't come close to the book or animated movie. Like so many remakes and reboots this new Jungle Book is completely unnecessary. If they tried to do a lot of different things with the material, or stuck closer to the book or something, I could maybe see the need for this but as it is it just doesn't bring enough new things to the table and what it does offer lacks coherence, excitement, and logic.

My main problem with the movie is that everything feels like a setup and there's no real connection to the story or characters. The plot wasn't executed that well, with quite a few generic scenes and issues with tone and pacing. It feels like scenes loosely connected and tied together to make a story and to get everything in there. They seemed to be trying hard to get a few laughs in there, force in some songs, and have things the general crowd will recognize.

*spoilers*

The scene where Shere Khan just walks up to the wolves, kills Akela, and then claims that area for himself is pretty ridiculous. The wolves don't gang up on him, they don't retaliate for him killing one of their pack, they just sit there and let him take the place over. Aren't they supposed to be wolves? They keep talking about ""the law of the jungle"" and honor and yet they just let a tiger come in and start calling the shots? Strange. And we don't even see how Mowgli grows up with the animals and how they have a connection, he's just there. Then later we get a 3 minute or so flashback showing him as a toddler. His father is killed by Shere Khan and he just walks up to Bagheera and instantly they're best friends. This scene happens after Kaa is introduced and then all of a sudden Baloo steps in to the story, saves the man-cub, and Kaa is forever out of the story. Then Mowgli and Baloo collect honey for a little while and then they're best of friends, they even sing a song which is pretty out of place. Akela is a character no audience could care about and yet his death is treated like a big deal to the characters and a reason to go back and stand up to Shere Khan.

King Louie is introduced by a cowbell and starts singing a very out of place tune. He wants Mowgli to work with him, he refuses and attempts an escape, and so King Louie proceeds to smash down his own home and then presumably gets crushed to death. Hmm. Mowgli gets upset about Akela's death, musters up some courage to face Shere Khan, and runs back to his home. Only it takes him 30 seconds to run back there when this whole time he's been traveling to the man village which was far away. Well that doesn't make sense. But not only that, along the way he accidentally starts a fire and it starts to burn down the forest. A few embers drop to the ground and next thing you know by the time he runs back home, which seems to take only minutes, the entire place is up in flames. So in what time span did that happen exactly? Seems like sloppy writing to me. The pacing is just downright bad. Anyway, all the animals together are no match for Shere Khan (that's gotta be the strongest Tiger that ever lived) and so he chases down Mowgli and finally has his showdown with him, although the final fight is strangely reminiscent of Lion King. It's just more generic and uninspired drama with a serious lack of tension.

There's not a single compelling character in the entire movie and that's a big problem. In the book and animated movie there were characters, but not here. People can talk all they want about the great effects, but effects will only take you so far. The voice acting was neither good nor bad, stars voice the characters but there's no weight behind it. No real reason why there couldn't have just been professional voice actors in there instead of well known actors who act more like special guests, it's very distracting watching these CGI animals being voiced by them. The CGI was good for being CGI but it looks so fake it wouldn't even be proper to call this ""live action."" Everything looks so clean and computerized, it just looks fake, and it really took me out of it. The kid was the only thing that's real, everything else is CGI in front of green screens and you can tell too.

Whether or not this new Jungle Book was needed I suppose it doesn't really matter, but regardless I still have to judge it as a Jungle Book movie, and as a Jungle Book movie it's very underwhelming. I really have no idea why it's gotten such high marks from everyone, it's not very good. Definitely not terrible, but it's just completely forgettable and certainly not worthy of the high praise that it's been given.",1472860800,,4660,4.362903225806452

7123414,5,B00W605FDO,"I enjoyed watching the Blu-ray/DVD combo of The Jungle Book about Mowgli (Neel Sethi) who is the only man cub in the jungle. He wants to be a wolf, but in reality he's not. He is raised by wolves and he feels he has a nice life. Then one day Shere Khan (Idris Elba) threatens Mowglis life. While the wolves argue about whether or not Mowgli should leave for the safety of the pack, Mowgli decides for them and leaves. He ventures out to find the man village. On his way to the man village, he meets many enemies and friends like King Louie (Christopher Walken), Kaa (Scarlett Johansson) and Baloo (Bill Murray).  What will happen next?  Will he make it to the man village?  Does Shere Khan catch him? You just have to watch the movie to find out.

What I liked about the bonus features on the Blu-ray disc is a feature called, The Jungle Book Reimagined which shows ideas for the remake of The Jungle Book and Neel Sethis experience while acting on the set. This shows the relationship between Neel and the director. There is also a bonus audio commentary feature from the director, Jon Favreau, which is great because you get to hear what he was thinking when making the movie. Another added bonus allows you to go to the scene selection and select the scene you want, plus there is a setup feature so you can insert your own settings. There is also a DVD version included and a download code to download a digital copy if you would prefer to use that versus the discs.

What I like about this movie are the CGIs which are so realistic that you think the sets are real because they are so incredibly detailed. The animals look realistic as well and the backgrounds are very intricate.  But, as I learned in the Blu-ray feature I am Mowgli, it shows that it was all done on green screen, which makes this film more incredible because most of it isn't real!  The voice acting is superb.  Idris Elba, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken and many others truly bring the animals to life with their outstanding voice over work. Speaking about Christopher Walken, another bonus feature is King Louies Temple Layer by Layer.  It shows you how the I Wanna Be Like You scene was created. It is very interesting to watch how the orchestra, Christopher Walken, the storyboard and green screens worked together to make that sequence.  Finally, the music is superb and adds so much more energy and excitement to the movie. It just makes the scenes more interesting than they would be without such compelling music.

What you should know about this film is that there are many intense scenes. Even I jumped out of my seat a few times. This isn't a movie for children below age 9 and is definitely a know your kid type of movie. I also didn't like how King Louie doesnt look as friendly as in the original movie. Aside from that, this movie is truly outstanding entertainment.

I recommend this film to kids ages 9 to 18.  People who like action, adventure and comedy movies will surely enjoy this. It does have intense scenes and will make you jump but I give it 4 out of 5 stars and love all the bonus features on the DVD/Blu-ray/Digital HD which is available

7123491,3,B00W605FDO,"I was looking forward to this version of the classic Kipling tale, and I think I may have liked it better if I hadn't seen the original Disney version - which this film tried to emulate, but managed to miss the mark.

For example the character voices were far better in the original version - Sebastian Cabot, Phil Harris and particularly Sterling Holloway blew away the actor voices in this film version. The original film had more songs as well, and they were more naturally part of the movie (and performed better to boot). The only actor's voice performance that rivaled the original film was Christopher Walken as King Louie.

There is some amazingly detailed CGI in this film, but CGI does not make a movie. The first Disney film with it's hand drawn animation was a lot more fun because the storyline moved along better, and that is what makes a good film. If you're going to remake something, make it better - don't just toss in new technology and miss out on all the fun!",1472688000,3,980,4.531073446327683

The effects were stunning, the story was faithful yet had a few twists. If this movie or the little boy who plays Mowgli don't get an award nomination, that's an upset. He and this movie are worthy of an Oscar. I would not take toddlers to see it, just because of some very brief intense moments. Go buy this movie.

Take King Louis for instance...when I saw it in the theater there were little kids saying ""mommy I'm scared"" during his scenes and to be honest I don't blame them.
While the tone for the original is fun and care free, this is a story of survival and the terrors Mowgli had to face.
And while the original finds Mowgli eventually finding his place. The remake has him stay in the jungle and never leave.

7123511,4,B00W605FDO,"Disney brings its venerable technique of mixing live and animated forms to full fruition in The Jungle Book, a rollicking remake of the 1967 classic thats surprisingly fun, if ecologically messy.

Directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man, Chef) with reverence for the cartoon and more of a nod to Rudyard Kiplings original 1896 fable, The Jungle Book is nearly nonstop action for long stretches as young Mowgli is chased, hypnotized, bamboozled and kidnapped by a variety of unlikely jungle denizens.  Conscientious and eco-minded adults will struggle for the actual moral to it all; Kiplings original story drew parallels between mans dominion over nature and Britains imperial ambitions over most of the Third World.  Disneys animated film glossed over all that.  Favreau and writer Justin Marks ditch most of the songs in favor of some utopian vision of animals peacefully coexisting (we never see the carnivores consume meat) with a young man-cub who can speak their language, despite the fact that he will grow into the thing they fear most.  Most controversially, they completely change the ending of the original, which further confuses the issues.  But in an age where Disneys animated films (Zootopia) deftly wrestle with deeper themes of the nature of animals and humans, the live action films seem freer to just have some fun.

As Mowgli, newcomer Neel Sethi is a delight; gleefully nave but shrewd and resourceful.  His performance is especially noteworthy in that hes the only actual human; he had to act to puppets, prompts and a room of green screen.  Bill Murray embodies Mowglis bear friend Baloo with mirth and sweetness, and Ben Kingsley finds the right authoritarian note as his protector, the panther Bagheera.  But its Idris Elbas terrifying scarred tiger Shere Khan that steals the show, made all the scarier because he just might be right about the threat of man.

Christopher Walkens take on King Louie is a bit mystifyingthe oversized orangutan (or, in this version, gigantopithecus) could easily be called King Kong for his dinosaur-sized girth.  He and Kaa, the snake (a beguiling Scarlett Johansson in an all-too brief cameo) are monstrously overlarge.  We first encounter Louie by hearing his raspy voice emanate from the shadows of his temple, surrounded by offerings of fruit and treasure, like Marlon Brandos Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now, imploring Mowgli to support his twisted and self-deluded desire to learn to make fire (the red flower).  Disney added the character of King Louie to the original as a weird nod to the hippie/jazz/beatnik culture.  When Walken breaks into his signature song, I Wanna Be Like You, its fraught with menace.  Ironically, in a fable of mostly smart animals who can all communicate with each other, Louie is the only one who wants to break free of the Law of the Jungle and evolve.

This is the rare movie for which Id highly recommend a 3D viewing; youll be immersed in a digital jungle with surreal landscapes that are the stuff of dreams and nightmares; a run through tangles of vines, massively entwined tree branches, raging floods and wildebeest stampedes, and claws length from one vengeful and nasty tiger.

Eco-reality and moral ambiguity aside, this is a fun, mercifully brief romp in a fantasy world that delivers with staggering visuals and warm humor.

THE KID FACTOR:  Pretty intense in some scenes, and a lot of these characters will give kids nightmares.

7123518,5,B00W605FDO,"Favreau did a stellar job on this remake!  The Jungle Book has always been one of my favorite Disney films, and I have fond childhood memories of these characters.  I was most excited to see how a ""real-life"" adaptation would turn out!

A few points of interest:

*Some of the storyline does change from the original, so it is fresh in that way.

*There are preludes to the introduction of some of the characters we love, and there is a bit of suspense awaiting them.

*I found the score to be fascinating. This film was synonymous with certain songs; of those, only one was fully reminiscent of its predecessor.  The others were either reworked some, or served as background orchestral/theatrical numbers.  All were recognizable though, and I thought they were just beautifully done.  Even with new scenery, nostalgia rings strong in undertones.  Fantastic.

*One of my favorite scenes is when the baby elephant is first shown.  The subtle slow shot was a small touch that left a big impact.

*Special affects were on point.

*Kaa's infamous hypnotizing was tweaked in a significant way for this plot line.

*The bees DO sting.  The bees always sting.  Lol.

I was hoping that this wouldn't be a movie that only looked good in trailers, and I was not disappointed one bit.  Extremely immersive CGI, you honestly don't even know it's there.  The character Mowgli is awesome and perfect for the role.  I wanted to see a bit more of the Kaa character (now in female form) and that the song might be played as part of the hypnotic scene, but that didn't happen; fortunately she did sing it at the credits.

7123593,4,B00W605FDO,"This wasn't a bad remake of a classic movie based on an even older book.  It's marketed as live action, but really the only non animated character is Mowgli, the man cub.  Every other character is still animated, although granted they look a lot more realistic than they ever did before.  Technology for the human in a cartoon has certainly come a long way since Who Framed Roger Rabbit.  The storyline is pretty basic, a kid who has been raised by wolves after a panther told them to, has been targeted by a tiger who doesn't like his kind (man) and wants him dead once the truce brought on by a drought where no animals can kill each other is brought to an end by rain.  This truce seemed a bit odd to me, I mean what do all the carnivores eat during this time? I mean Mowgli has baby puppy brothers and sisters that need nourishment to grow, not to mention food to stay alive. It seems odd no animals are insulted that he is using the shell of a dead turtle to scoop water. But that's the scenario we have here, of course it rains, Mowgli is taken away by the panther for his own safety but the panther is attacked on route to the human village.  Mowgli flees on the back of a buffalo, the Tiger goes back to the wolves and kills the alpha knowing word will get to Mowgli and he'll return for vengeance where he can be killed.  Mowgli encounters a giant snake, a  bear, some monkeys, a King Kong sized orangutan, and other animals along the way who either try to kill him or use him for their own gains.

The movie does involve the death of some animals but since it's a kids movie it happens off screen or masked by smoke or something each time.  It doesn't have constant interruptions of songs like the original cartoon version, but there still is one or two.  The one by Christopher Walken didn't really fit into the flow of what was happening at the time and seemed to be there simply because it was in the all animated earlier film.  The repeated words at the end of each sentence was actually quite annoying as it was out of tune.

But overall The Jungle Book isn't a bad movie.  The closing credits are visually quite interesting with the animation happening on top of the pages of the book, then you've got a James Bond style silhouette thing happening which was quite well done, in fact the whole closing credits were.  Mowgli acts like a human boy who has lived with humans rather than a boy raised by canines but other than that, it's a fairly decent film.",1472169600,,2470,4.316017316017316

Whats Not?

- Kaa part in the film was short and forgettable
- Why is King Louie so big....?

What is it?
Take the classic story of The Jungle Book, and make it live action, but make everything CGI but the main actor who portrays Mowgli. Now you have The Jungle Book 2016... Trust me its a lot better than this sounds.

Story: 4.5
The story of The Jungle Book 2016 doesn't divert much from the original film or book, but it ads more substance is some areas. The film start off like it should with Bagheera the black panther (Voiced by Ben Kingsley) finding the man cub Mowgli (Neel Sethi) and taking him to the wolf pack to be raised. This is where more substance was added and in, as Disney give the wolves, mainly  Raksha and Akela (Alpha Wolves voiced by Lupita Nyong'o and Giancarlo Esposito) more character development. You will learn early on that the jungle is going through a dry spell so they going into a time of peace where the animals can't attack / hunt each other. Sheer Khan  (Tiger voiced by Idris Elba) realizes that the wolves are harboring a man cub and vows to take revenge on Mowgli as soon as the truce is over and the rains returns. This set the plot into motion where Bagheera decides to take Mogwli to the man village where he will be safe (You know the typical Jungle Book stuff) . Disney does a couple more interesting things with the plot but I won't spoil the story much more. I'll will say that they did cut out the the whole vulture scenes from the film, though you probably won't miss it unless you were a fan of them in the original.

Audio / Sound:  5
This is your typical Disney goodness here. I was skeptical a head of time when it came to the music side of thing due to the original film being a musical and this one not appearing to be. I would be lying to if said that there is no singing in this movie, because there is but it is far from the musical that the original was. The two main songs from the original film make return here, and I have to say they were cleverly implemented. Especially I wanna be like you which is sung by King Louie (Christopher Walken). That right Christopher Walken sings in this film, how bad-ass is that. You will also here a lot of nostalgic themes from the original including a instrumental version of the Bear Necessities. Acting and Voice acting is what you would expect from a Disney film, It is top notch. The all-star cast has did an excellent job but, the real star of the show is Neel Sethi. It is hard enough to be a child actor but to be the only actor on an empty stage and make people believe that you are in a jungle surrounded by animals is astonishing. This kid deserves an Oscar....

Aesthetics: 5
Now let me introduce to best supporting actor, Disney Animation....... What kind of black magic does  Disney know? I went into see the movie knowing that all of this was done using a green screens but you will honestly forget that with in seconds of watching. This is easily one of the best CGI jobs that I ever have seen.

Replay: 4.5
I'm getting this on bluray as soon as it releases. I also will be see it in 3D in the next few days. Kids will love the film and its definitely wroth seeing on the big screen.

Around the Web: 4.7
Via  Rotten Tomatoes (April 22, 2016)

Thoughts
If I had to choose between 2016 vs 1967 I would easily choose the 2016 version. It is just that well done. The original feels like it was missing a lot of substance, and the 2016 version isn't really missing anything... I feel sorry for the Non-Disney version that will be coming out in 2017. Disney is pretty much unstoppable right now. First with Zootopia, and now The Jungle Book 2016. Their next film will be Moana, and it will have hard acts to follow. I highly recommend this film to Disney fans, and fans of the original 1967 film. If you are fans of neither you should still check it out due to how well it was done.

The 'Rudyard Kipling' classic has notably been brought to the silver-screen a few times down
the years including the 'Sabu' film of 1942 which continued to do the rounds in the cinema
well into the 50's , there was a 1994 version with 'Jason Scott Lee' which i must confess i have
never seen.....'Disney' gave us the brilliant 1967 animated feature-film and have now brought
forth this 'live' plus glorious c.g.i gem....with all our best-loved and favourite characters
realistically recreated.
Telling the story of the man-cub 'Mowgli' (Neel Sethi) who had seemingly been abandoned in
the Jungle and found wandering by the Panther 'Bagheera' (voiced by Ben Kingsley) and given
to a wolf-pack to raise as their own. (The infant Mowgli played by Kendrick Reyes)
As 'Mowgli' grows older the fearsome tiger 'Shere Khan' (voiced by Idris Elba) who rules the
roost in this part of the Jungle makes threats against the young man-cub saying that he doesn't
belong.
Well, 'Mowgli' has known no other life and looks upon 'Raksha' (voiced by Lupita Nyong'o) his
adopted mother and her cubs as his family, but is convinced by 'Bagheera' that he should now
seek a life among his own kind.
'Bagheera' will escort the young man-cub to the edge of the Jungle to do this, however 'Shere
Khan' has other idea's, 'Mowgli' told to run becomes separated from his friend and guardian
and embarks upon a journey of discovery first running into the enormous Python 'Kaa' (voiced
by Scarlett Johansson) who.at first seems friendly but has supper on her mind
'Mowgli' is rescued from 'Kaa' by the lovable sloth-bear 'Baloo' (voiced by Bill Murray) ..they
are to become great friends, 'Baloo' wanting the ingenuity of the man-cub to help him collect
honey from the rock-face 'Baloo' cannot climb (afraid of heights)...he'll convince 'Mowgli' to
stick around under his protection for a while, at least until 'Bagheera' again finds him.
When 'Bagheera' does find 'Mowgli' he tells 'Baloo' the troubles that have befallen the wolf-pack
at the hands of 'Shera Khan' and that the Tiger hasn't given up on killing 'Mowgli'
'Mowgli' has always been told by 'Raksha' and indeed 'Bagheera' that his human-tricks have no
place in the Jungle, however when seeing them used to help recover a young Elephant from a
ditch he'd fallen into 'Bagheera' will have second thougts no doubt.
The danger remains so reluctantly 'Baloo' will tell 'Mowgli' he's not wanted anymore and that
he's to go to the man village....however 'Mowgi' becomes kidnapped by the Bandar-Log monkeys
who present their capture to their leader 'King Louie' (voiced by Christopher Walken) who will
offer the man-cub protection from the Tiger in return for the ability to make 'fire' ...thinking all
humans know how.
Well 'Bagheera' and 'Baloo' will attempt to rescue their young friend from the clutches of the giant
Ape..........'Mowgli' will want to remain in the Jungle with those and what he knows but will have
to face 'Shera Khan' to do so....
A delightful presentation from the Disney-Studio's which includes the songs 'The Bare Necessities'
and 'I Want to be Like You' so fondly remembered by many.
The film is quite simply a delight and visually-stunning from start to finish.....surely a must-see.

7123603,3,B00W605FDO,"Special effect and CGI were awesome and it had a good voice cast, that's all this movie has going for it. It was a cute story but it wasn't anything special. The animals were all 2-4 times bigger than should be. Mowgli looked as if he was only 2 feet tall. The singing, only two songs in the movie, seemed very out of place. The voice acting was great and at points it had some good drama but throughout most the movie the story was boring and almost hard to pay attention to. The only time it held my attention were the fight scenes which were short but very well done. Baloo isn't a fun loving bear but instead a big jerk. Kaa is a female and they didn't use the Trust in Me song which I found odd they would leave it out. Bagheera is still the voice of reason, I really liked his character. For kids this might be a good movie, but it can get pretty violent but no worse than Lion King. It just didn't live up to the hype. Everyone acted as if was the best thing ever and it's just an average movie. They also tried a bit too hard to make it a serious film, they should have kept the humor and fun upbeat attitude of the original. I am honestly surprised it's getting all these good reviews but to each his own.",1471910400,2,1214,4.0625

The film plunked me down in the jungle and took my breath away.  The personality of Mogli was perfectly sussed -- tough, dirty, bloodied, scarred all over and thinking nothing of it -- zero bothers given.  Glorious.  Personalities of the animals was righteously tuned to the specie.  Every tree looked climbable, every pond drinkable, every flower in full bloom, and best of all the animals' society was presented so well that I don't think Kipling spun even once in the grave.  Bonus: easy peasy to expect a sequel......so many stories in the book

7123609,2,B00W605FDO,"I'm seeing some negative reviews focused on the fact that Disney is releasing its movies in 3D abroad but not at home. Reviewers of other recent Disney movies are also complaining that Disney is no longer releasing bonus material in DVD format but rather in blu-ray format only. You may also have noticed that DVD's are not released right away by themselves.  At first,  the only thing available is the blu-ray + DVD + digital HD set which costs more than just the DVD alone.  These things are happening because Disney expects to be able to extract more money out of Americans than it desires to get from foreigners.  Disney expects Americans to be impatient enough to purchase the movie now,  and then again when it is released with bonus materials in DVD format,  and then again when it comes out in 3-D.  Part of the reason of putting movies into the vault is to encourage such impatience to stimulate Americans to rush to buy whatever form their products is available immediately when the first sign of them appears on the market.

THEY WANT OUR MONEY BUT YET DO WHAT THEY WANT BY NOT ANSWERING, NO LISTENING, NOT HEEDING TO OUR WANTS!!!!!  People should STOP BUYING their products UNTIL they release all versions, all aspects, at the same time, of every movie when released on home video.

What they lacked in music they had to make up for it with endless boring dialog and talking. The characters themselves  were rather boring and they made Baloo kind of a douche. As much as I like Bill Murray, his voice would have matched better if they lowered it like in the original.

The elephants don't talk at all and neither do the vultures, who are almost left out completely except for a small scene. Instead of a sly male snake Kaa was voiced by Scarlett Johansson.

I don't know it just felt like like they took a cartoon or story with so much energy behind it and tried to make it into a serious movie and the result is meh.",1470528000,4,803,4.235294117647059

7123653,5,B00W605FDO,"Disney is on a roll! First their Alice in Wonderland (complete with 3D fight to the death with a Jabberwocky voiced by Christopher Lee), then a Cinderella in the style of a 1960's Disney Film with charm, heart, and beautiful music and costumes, and now this!

For people who know their film history this is not a remake of the original Jungle Book from 1942 (that would be the 1994 remake with Jason Scott Lee). No, this is a remake of the 1967 animated feature (which I actually saw re-released in the theater as a child). Why would Disney remake a classic as a live action film? And why would you want to see it? Well in my opinion, the 1967 film is not very good (saw it countless times as a kid, never wanted to see it again as an adult), and secondly this is not a live-action film strictly speaking. What this is, is a blend of live-action and animation that is so life-like that there's pretty much nothing to compare it to compare it to except Legend of the Guardians (another film with animation so realistic that you wouldn't be blamed for not being able to tell if it's a live-action or animated film if your eyes weren't too good).

From the trailer for this film I thought it was going to be terrible, but a co-worker told me that it was very good, so I decided to give it a shot. I'll admit I was not expecting great things from the director of ""Cowboys and Aliens"" but I was VERY pleasantly surprised.

You won't find reviews discussing the plot in great detail, because like most great adventure/character films there really isn't one. Young boy is raised by wolves, threatened by a tiger, and has to go back to humankind and/or face the evil tiger and a series of other threats whilst have various encounters with various animals friendly and dangerous that involve lots of fun, silly, and death-defying antics. 'Nuff said. And so it falls to the pacing, editing, camerawork, animation, voice acting, and general cinema craftsmanship to craft a film that you'll want to see ""Finding Dory"" or a film you won't ""The Good Dinosaur"". Thankful it's the former, not the latter.

For starters, Mowgli is a likable kid unlike in the 1967 version where he was an annoying idiot. Secondly EVERYONE else in the film is amazing in their voice work, to the point where I think this film may become legendary for the quality of its voice work (yeah, again, along with ""Legend of The Guardians""). There's singing to be found (the same songs from 1967) and the singing isn't the greatest, but the style and sheer fun of the songs makes it wonderfully entertaining.

Visually there's a great deal of beautiful CGI, beautiful animation, beautiful camera-work, and beautiful light and color making every moment a joy to behold. Audibly there's a great score, and amazing sound directionality (the scene where Kaa is introduced is incredible in the theater and is absolutely the best example I've seen since Mickey Mouse runs completely around you looking for Donald Duck in Fantasia 2000).

More than all these elements though, the film comes together as a cohesive dramatic whole to tell a compelling story that remain with you after viewing. I would suggest viewing before showing to very young children to make sure the peril and death from the tiger aren't too much, but after seeing this wonderful film I can't imagine why anyone would want to show their children the boring 1967 version instead. I think Walt Disney would be proud of this one.

I plan buying the Blu Ray and keeping it with ""Legend of the Guardians"". I believe these two films have created a new genre (Primarily composed of Ultra-Realistic Animation which may be combined with Live-Action elements; Yes, I'll admit I never got around to watching ""Dinosaur""). And this is one genre I would gladly see more of if the films continue to be of this quality. Just prepare yourself for talking CGI animals which have the stylized look of CGI effects and so much CGI around Mowgli it's impossible to tell when it's a person and when it's an effect. In my opinion this does not detract from this beautiful tale in the slightest.",1468627200,5,4091,4.650069156293223

7123663,4,B00W605FDO,"There is little new in this live action version of the classic story by Rudyard Kipling, but Disney still does it right, mostly.  Of course Kipling's stories are somewhat fantastical to be sure, even whimsical, but this telling has many things going for it.  The CGI animals are incredible.  The actors do a good job carrying their characters, and I have to say that I liked the casting.  This cast is not likely to be matched anytime soon.  I mean, come on, Bill Murray does a great Baloo (though he lacks that booming bass voice we came to love in the animated Disney version), Ben Kingsley does a noble job as Bageera the panther, Idris Elba makes a fine antagonist to Mowgli, Scarlett Johansson as Kaa (though her appearance is all too short), and Christopher Walken as King Louie.

I'm not sure why they made King Louie so scary...but that wasn't my call.

All in all, the casting was great, the CGI was amazing, and they did a good job telling the same tale - the Disney version of the tale with ver variations.  Maybe that's what left me a little flat.  Anyway, don't get me wrong, this is a great offering, but IMO it is NOT a children's movie - too scary for the younger crowd, thus 4 stars.",1468454400,2,1200,4.418181818181818

The second of Disneys live-action remakes of classic cartoons, The Jungle Book is surprisingly true to the original. Its got extra grit and is less childish but manages to recreate the charm that will put a smile on your face regardless of your age. There are a few scary moments for the younger audience members but they are, thankfully, brief and easily forgotten in the face of impressive effects and performances, most notably the show-stealing Baloo voiced by Bill Murray.

7123696,4,B00W605FDO,"What you see here in 2016 is an immersive trip into The Jungle Book that no other adaptation has ever brought to life, additionally exploring the same themes of mans relation with the wild that were set aside by the Disney cartoon.

This triumph in Disney entertainment owes its thanks solely to director Jon Favreau, who people know for his lighthearted fantasy family fun with favorites such as Iron Man. Now, he proves to be a true showman of the screen in the same manner as Christopher Nolan or James Cameron, building upon several of the same cinematic techniques used back in Avatar. He knew the jazzy, family-friendly tone of the original cartoon didn't fit the photo-real image he had in mind, so went with the feel of danger and mythology in Kiplings original conceptiona decision made for the better.

The result is a dizzying, majestic experience complete with grand waterfalls, sunbeams, time-lapse photography, tense mudslides, and eerie fog. Here is the real star of the film: the creation of each individual animal. Their walking patterns are all accurate to their real-life counterparts, with tangible fur textures that add to the weight of each character. However they don't look quite as real when they're talking or making unnatural movements, so it may not be the best showcase of special effects youve ever seen. Yet even so, the visions of the jungles citizens interacting around a waterhole creates a wonderful sight, and the creation of the major characters truly makes The Jungle Book come alive.

Bagheera is voiced by Ben Kingsley, and he sounds miraculously similar to his cartoon counterpart.

Shere Khan is voiced menacingly by Idris Elba, and the casting choice could not have made the villain feel more alive.

Baloo is voiced by Bill Murray, who unfortunately make things fall apart a bit. He is literally Bill Murray with fur, snapping the typical Bill Murray humor, and removing a bit of the magic.

But that is thankfully made up for, as the originally playful orangutan King Louie has been transformed into a gigantopithecus. He sits on his throne like Jabba the Hutt, rests in the shadows like Don Corleone, and appears genuinely threatening thanks to the spectacular voice and facial work by Christopher Walken.

The most resonating of all the on-screen moments is the 150-foot long snake, Kaa, whose body coils the forest of vines overrun with echoes. Favreau made such a perfect decision in casting the spooky emotive voice of Scarlett Johansson that punches you in the gut.

Then theres Neel Sethi, the newcomer who plays Mowgli. While he does look, act, and sound exactly like the cartoon, he says all his lines in one breath too often, and simply never acts genuine.

The focus is not on the little boy raised by wolves. The focus is on the spectacle of the talking creatures. Although it may just as well hurt the product. Screenwriter Justin Marks has made some changes from the animated feature to expand upon the themes: Mowgli is already a grown boy by the beginning, not a baby found in the river by Bagheera; He is challenged in how he must learn to be a wolf, not a man cub; His resourceful inventions to help him come across obstacles such as drinking water are ridiculed by the wolf pack for not being the wolf way; He overall wonders, how many lives is a man cub worth?

It sounds like a fairly overused plot about an outcast who learns to be himself. Well let me tell you, it is. It also has some of the other predictable plot devices such as an unnecessary backstory full of coincidences.

But for every unnecessary change made, there is another change that makes The Jungle Book 2016 overall stronger than its animated counterpart. There is significantly more focus put into the weapon of man (the red flower, or fire). Each of the characters are more involved in the journey of Mowgli, with the exception of Kaa and King Louie. But thats a good thing, because these characters each had the two best scenes.

I will admit, The Jungle Book is an enlightening contribution to movies deserving to be experienced on the largest screen possible. Yet is it the real deal when it comes to that level of entertainment? Not quite.  The writing is been there, done that, for the most part, and the special effects can be easily nitpicked. But setting the flawed narrative aside, try to think of big pictures such as this one as ways to bring us back in touch with our environment, inspiring us to go out into the wilderness to experience its majesty first-hand. Here is what Rudyard Kiplings original novel was about: defining our relationship with the wild which were guilty of endangering. Therefore, I encourage you to purchase this once it's available.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

7123745,5,B00W605FDO,"Disney's 2016 ""The Jungle Book"" brings advanced and highly realistic CGI to a live-action version of its cartoon produced many years ago, itself modeled on the famous stories by British author Rudyard Kipling.  An outstanding cast of voice actors including Ben Kingsley, Bill Murray, Scarlett Johansson and Chris Walken give the animated animals life and personality.  Neel Sethi is terrific and believable as Mowgli, the man-cub raised by a pack of wolves in the jungles of India but facing an inevitable confrontation with the implications of his human heritage.  The storyline freely mixes elements from the book and the earlier Disney cartoon.  The result is something fresh, exciting, and compelling.  Note to viewers: some scenes may be too intense for small children.  Highly recommended.",1464393600,5,795,5.370967741935484

7123764,4,B00W605FDO,"Disney sure loves them some talking animals, especially those that deliver a powerful message. As ""Zootopia"" continues to be a force at the box office, the Mouse House has dazzled us once more with the ultimate ""talking animal"" film, Rudyard Kipling's ""The Jungle Book"". While they already boast what had been the definitive adaptation with their 1967 animated classic, that perception may be about to change. Jon Favreau, who directed a pair of ""Iron Man"" films and other visual spectacles, brings Kipling's jungle adventure to life with a technical wizardry only exceeded by the genuine emotion he's able to evoke from this artificial animal kingdom.

Favreau doesn't muck around with the nuts and bolts of Kipling's story too much, except that the tone is decidedly darker. In fact, it's pretty damned scary at times and the stakes are much greater than seen in the animated film. It makes for a more mature story, but there's also enough humor and light-hearted fun that everybody will have something to love. Newcomer Neel Sethi plays ""man cub"" Mowgli, raised in the jungle by black panther Bagheera (voiced by Ben Kingsley, who does ""wizened old man"" better than anyone) and a wolf pack led by Akela (Giancarlo Esposito) and Raksha (Lupita Nyong'o). But there's danger in the form of tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba), who wishes to devour Mowgli before he can become a man, as man is no friend of the jungle. In order to keep Mowgli safe, Bagheera takes him on a journey to the village where men live and wield the destructive power of the fiery ""red flower"".

So basically this is like the anti-""Life of Pi"", where the tiger and man are totally at odds rather than relying on one another for survival. Forget Scar, Shere Khan is the most fearsome cat in Disney's vast array of villains. The interesting thing about Kipling's story, adapted here by Justin Marks, is that Khan isn't necessarily wrong. The animals all live by a certain agreed upon code, that man does not belong in the jungle. Khan's brutal tactics, spurred on by a burn he suffered at the hands of man years earlier, are what separates him from the other peace-loving creatures. And those creatures include the fun-loving, mischievous bear Baloo (voiced with sarcastic glee by Bill Murray), who befriends Mowgli and teaches him the ""bear necessities"". The scenes with them together are the film's highlight, and of course the familiar song is also a part of it. There are only two key songs that Favreau chose to include, the other is the Vaudevillian ""I Wanna Be Like You"" featuring a scat-tastic Christopher Walken as massive orangutan King Louie, and perhaps it would have been better to include a few more. While the two songs are great (both will be stuck in your head for days, trust me) and the performances wonderful, they don't arrive until well past the halfway point and don't necessarily fit with the story's darker tone. There are multiple times when Mowgli faces certain death, like a terrifying encounter with the serpent Kaa (seductively voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and other times when beloved characters suffer at the claws of Khan.

While the story remains mostly intact, there are a few changes that alter the course of the story. One involves elephants and their place at the top of the jungle hierarchy, seen almost as god-like in their majesty. One of the film's most beautiful, sincerely touching scenes involves Mowgli and the emotional connection he forms with the pack of elephants. Favreau, aided by cinematographer Bill Pope and Peter Jackson's WETA Digital, captures the serenity and danger of the jungle. Every scene bristles with vibrant colors and energy, right down to the tiniest detail. That the vast majority of it was captured in a studio somewhere and on somebody's laptop computer is incredible; you'll feel as if you're really swinging from the trees racing a bunch of thieving monkeys.

It's hard to imagine a film that can do justice to Kipling's story better than Favreau's ""The Jungle Book"" has done. Others will try, of course, including a film directed by Andy Serkis in a couple of years for Warner Bros., but they'll find it hard to improve upon anything that Favreau has already accomplished,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Jungle-Book-BD-DVD-Digital-HD-Blu-ray/dp/B01CTNDO58/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Jungle Book (BD + DVD + Digital HD) [Blu-ray</a>]",1463788800,5,4427,5.09366391184573

I was surprised at the level of violence that the child faced, and some of the violent interactions between the animals, it seemed a little extreme for a PG movie.  Obviously there is no comparison to the Disney animated version, the characters are similar, and they even tried to push in some of that old Disney music from the original movie, but the charm and enthusiasm were missing.  The only part of the movie that I found interesting involved Scarlet Johansson's voice-over as the snake, whatever they did to modify her voice was amazing!  Listening to her voice was hypnotizing!  Overall, I thought this movie was a little too violent at times, annoying in others, and boring for the remainder.

The voices were all exquisitely done by well known hollywood stars ( I will let you figure out who they are when you watch it). The jungle sets, mostly CGI as well are lush and use the 3D well, not exploiting it. The musical score is excellent and two of the songs are masterfully done by King Louie and Balu. I was deeply touched by the animal characters who acquire another dimension with their facial and eye expressions. Some scenes may be a bit strong for little children, but what Disney classic doesn't have a scene that frightened us as kids when we saw it for the first time. Director John Favreau did a great job. Quite a different movie than the 1994 life action also from Disney starring Jason Lee.",1462752000,12,895,4.565217391304348

Director Jon Favreau and his collaborators have made a really good movie with special effects that frequently knocked my eyes out while consistently lulling me into the photorealistic reality of Mowglis world.  I did not share some reviewers dislike of the films ambivalence over being a musical, mostly because I didn't really want to watch a musical but loved Christopher Walkens surprising rendition of I Wanna Be Like You and that sequences nods to  Apocalypse Now and the cowbell sketch from Saturday Night Live (More cowbell!).  I downloaded the song and my son was requesting it for days.

As much as I enjoyed this film, however, part of me help but feel that Ive caught a glimpse of a future where there is no more nature but we really don't mind because it can be so skillfully recreated and there are no more fresh ideas but we really don't mind because the old ones can be repackaged so attractively.

7123816,5,B00W605FDO,"I recently saw The Jungle Book in theaters and was blew away by almost every aspect of the film.

Overall the story was something I already knew. If you have either read the stories by Rudyard Kipling ro seen the original animated classic done by Disney, you know the overall premise of the story. They stay pretty true to the Disney classic bringing in the songs from the original film and keeping most of the characters and elements of the animated film. Which is what I love, it's amazing seeing these animated movies that I have been watching since childhood in real life with such beautiful graphics and CGI that it is outstanding.

The scenes and animals in the movie are beyond my expectations. The CGI for the animals are perfect and look so real that at times when the animals aren't speaking human tongue, it would they could easily be mistaken for real animals, but thankfully PETA isn't in an uproar over this film because they are fake. As for all of the jungle scenes, they are outstanding. I saw the film in 3D on a big screen and everything looked so gorgeous and the colors of the plants and the natural scenery added to the overall beauty of the film.

Overall, I would say this is a very worthy adaptation of the classic animated film and of Kipling's stories. The acting done by the boy is very amazing and surprised me very much seeing a little kid making his way to the big screen and playing a role solely by himself and nailing it. And all of the voice acting is perfect for each animal as well, they add so much emotion to the roles and all of the voices were perfectly picked for the film. I would highly recommend this movie especially if you loved the animated film or the stories, they did such a good job bringing this story to life and adding new touches while staying true to the overall premise of the original story. I don't think you will be disappointing in this film and even if you are not a fan of the story, see it for the amazing graphics and scenes.

7123840,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book 2016 movie is inescapable. I read Kipling's book, written 120 years ago, as a kid and immediately went out and started swinging on Weeping Willows like a monkey. I watched the 1967 animated version in rooted disappointment. Then the 1994 live-action film appeared to be shot in a zoo. But last night I walked into a theater for just a peek before continuing to the movie I had bought a ticket for.  I was riveted in my seat in the first minute, and could not leave until the credits rolled to the end.

Mowgli the man cub is raised by a Wolf and her pack ever since he was brought to them as a baby by the Black Panther. Mowgli is taught the ways of the wolf, and the Law of the Pack, as I was as a Cub Scout: For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack. The boy faces certain challenges and is chastised for solving them with his man tricks such as using ropes and cunning.  He grows into a man-wolf learning the languages of the Elephant, Ape, Boa, Birds and every animal of the jungle, while slowly realizing that one day he will battle the Lord of the bush, the wicked Tiger.

The jungle is portrayed not as in the original 60s version of a wilderness to overcome, and not as neutral as the military suggests, but as my jungle survivor teacher taught, the jungle is your friend. And so the red flower  Fire  evolves different uses through the century along with the audiences, but always makes a cameo appearance at the end.

The cast was announced throughout 2014 with many famous voices leaping at the chance to become invisible animals before the mike. The search for casting Mowgli was extensive, with thousands of children auditioning from the USA and worldwide. Eventually, newcomer Neel Sethi of New York was confirmed for the role, and the 12-year old played it to the hilt. A natural.

Sethi underwent Parkour training in preparation for the role. Parkour is a training discipline that developed from military obstacle course training, or in my case before the word was born, from Boy Scout obstacle training courses. I saw early on the person who could cut the sharpest hypotenuse on the flat, and glide through the mud, and over the vertical wall, would be the fastest and earn a merit badge. It was just a matter of angles, which is easily viewed in Mowglis movement through the jungle to save his skin.

The movie is shot beautifully and though the only live actor is Mowgli, I was fooled. The Jungle Book is running wild over the competition in theaters, so don't be surprised if you have to fight for a seat.",1461628800,,2582,4.464968152866242

7123843,5,B00W605FDO,"Wow is this movie outstanding.

  Since the late 90's, we have been bombarded by movies with CGI effects, but this one takes them to a whole new and remarkable artistic level.  Every frame of this picture is a total joy to watch, because this Disney team spared no expense and they went into the finest details providing us with a true masterpiece.

  Most of us know the story written by the legendary English Author Joseph Rudyard Kipling's 1894 children's adventure masterpiece novel ""The Jungle Book"", and the Disney animated movie plus tv series that came in the 20th century.  A young boy is abandoned and left to be raised by noble wild animals in the jungle.

  The young boy is watched over in particular by a gallant pack of wolves, and a heroic sagacious black panther who knows this ""man cub"" is a special one.  The boy has to be taught, protected, but yet also set out on a physical trial of his own in order to survive against the creature who is Hell bent on hunting him down, the mighty Bengal Tiger ""Sher Khan"".

 During the boy's adventure he stumbles upon Bill Murray as the lovable bear ""Balloo"", and the tale continues.  Even Christopher Walken gets in on the action of this film, playing the gigantic monkey temple overlord ""King Louie"" (seeing of all the people in the world, Walken in that legendary voice role originally portrayed by Louis Prima, was a bombastic surprise but it does work.)

 Usually for my own tastes I rarely if ever watch or even review a movie aimed for kids, but this one in particular had profoundly moved me with the beauty and animated detail mixing real actors with the CGI backgrounds and creatures better then any other film placed upon screen in recent memory.

 My only complaint is certainly NOT with the movie nor Disney, but with our horrible American movie & tv rating system which physically makes me sick.  This film with out any doubt in my mind should have been rated G, because it is 2016's quintessential all ages family movie Disney has mastered over the many decades.  For those of you out there who believe ""The Jungle Book"" should have been left alone, this modern adaptation is a fine addition to the work done before, and may spark kids interest in watching the original cartoon film.

 Although panned, the 90's version with an adult Mowgli played by Jason Scott Lee, was in my mind also very enjoyable, but it pales in comparison with this version for the 2010's.

 This film provides brilliant scenes, lovable actors from years past guiding a very likable youngster, and some pretty deep and sinister villains.

I give this movie an A and two thumbs up.",1461542400,44,2627,4.644251626898048

Neel Sethi can't carry a note, but sings anyway.  It was as if Disney couldn't get all the musical rights from Disney.

While the CGI takes you in at first, the lifelessness of the characters comes out rather quickly.

The story is quite simple with Mowgli (Neel Sethi who is brilliant) who has been living with the wolves since he was a baby is cast out of the pack in fear and mistrust. With the help of his faithful friend Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) he begins to make his way to the man- village. However, Bagheera and the tiger Shere Khan (Idris Elba, wonderfully menacing) clash, Mowgli has to fend for himself. He then meets Baloo (Bill Murray) and they have a series of adventures together. The story is beautifully told and covers complicated topics like not fitting in,the importance of your pack staying together. One of my favorite moments of the film is where Bagheera and Baloo have validation that Mowgli is different and that taking him to the village may have him lose that. The movie is most definitely not one for small children, having some very tense scenes. I really felt that Jon Favreau has done a fantastic job of bringing one of my favorite childhood novels to life. The animals which I know are all CGI look superbly real.

7123856,5,B00W605FDO,"Theatrical review.  I haven't seen the original animated Disney film from 1967 in several years but went back to look at my review notes.  While I thought the animation and story was very good, it was clearly targeted at the youngest of kids.  This new mix, helmed by Jon Favereau (Iron Man) introduces live action in the form of Mowgli (Neel Sethi, in a wonderful debut).  Everything else is created on the computer including some very realistic looking wild animals from the Indian jungle.  Realistic except they talk of course.

In case you don't know the story, Mowgli was orphaned as a toddler after his father was killed by a tiger named Shere Khan (a scary Idris Elba).  The youngster was found by a panther, Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) and taken to a pack of wolves to raise.  The foster parents are Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) and Akela (Giancarlo Esposito).  We find Mowgli reaching an age (about 10) where he really doesnt fit in with the wolves or the jungle for that matter.  After some soul searching, it is decided he should be escorted to the village of men to live with his own kind.

Shere Khan, hates the humans for many reasons and especially the son of the man who burned out his eye.  So he stalks Mowgli in an attempt to kill him before he reaches the village.  Bagheera is taking the boy to the village, but Mowgli becomes separated when the 2 big cats confront each other.  Mowgli becomes ensnarled by a viper with a come-hither voice (Scarlett Johansson), and is rescued by Baloo (Bill Murray), a happy go lucky bear.  The pair partner up, with Baloo offering protection and an escort in exchange for Mowgli helping secure honey.

Unlike the original version this PG rated film offers up several instances of potential trauma, mostly created by Elbas tiger who lives near the top of the food chain (everyone respects the elephant).  Some younger kids might get a little scared.  What makes this movie special are the beautiful, creative graphics.  Kudos to young Neel as well who must do his acting without seeing the characters he must play off.  I could find little in the way of undercutting the visual trickery.  Every voice-actor is well cast in their roles with Murray as Baloo, a real comedic treat.  The film is colorful, imaginative, entertaining and one of the best family films in recent memory.  And my family is all grown and it works for me.  Highly recommended.",1461196800,7,2393,4.683453237410072

7123868,4,B00W605FDO,"The Good:
One of the best highlights of this film is probably how well the visuals were executed. The scenery of the jungle is beautiful and its given a lot of depth with the 3D effects. The use of the CGI quickly adapts you to the idea that these animals feel and express themselves just like humans. If you're like me, you may actually believe that animals can literally talk for that hour and a half.

With the combination of the human-like CGI infused with the animals, the addition of quality voice actors only makes the entire viewing experience that much better. Ben Kingsley (plays Bagheera the panther) and Bill Murray (Baloo the bear) are fully immersed into their characters. Idris Elba is both intimidating and terrifying as the tiger, Shere Khan. (He almost reminded me of that drunk, abusive step-dad character in movies). Neel Sethi is a perfect version of Mowgli, and Christopher Walken as King Louie the Monkey king is just a perfect casting as well.

What I personally appreciated was how this live-action remained faithful to the 1967 animated version. It seemed as though this film took all of the good parts and just went along with that. Even the songs were done pretty well without making this movie feel like a musical. It also had many humorous points throughout the film which kept the movie entertaining and fun for the most part.

Another highlight is how the movie's characters able to connect with viewers on an emotional level. (It is a Disney movie afterall) It does deal with some pretty classic themes such as not fitting in with society, the sense of family, bullying, and much more. For example, when it's time to feel the motherly love between Raksha (mother wolf played by Lupita Nyong'o) and Mowgli, you feel it. When it's time to feel tense and frightened by Shere Khan hunting you down, you feel that too.

The Bad:
I'm not sure how the 3D effects were shot but there are moments where it was just terribly blurry. It doesn't happen too often, but it was enough to notice. (Luckily the rest of the 3D effects don't overtake the viewing experience.) Besides that, the only thing I'd say is that this film's tone is a little darker than what many may expect. There are some jump scares and animal violence that more sensitive and younger audiences may want to be cautious about.

The Reason:

Well this certainly brought me back to the days when I used to watch the animated Jungle Book on VHS on repeat for days on end. If you grew up watching that film then you'll more than likely enjoy this new remake as well. I think it's well worth the watch in theaters. I can already see why Disney is already greenlighting a sequel. As I said above, be cautious with your children. While this movie is overall fun, charming, and heart-warming, the dark tones almost push the limits of the films PG rating. If they can handle watching Discovery channel animal fights, then they'll probably be okay for this film. So just use your best parental judgment before going in. (Or have an extra pillow ready in case someone needs to sleep next you for a few days)

Screenwriter: Justin Marks

Cast: Neel Sethi, Ben Kingsley, Idris Elba, Bill Murray, Christopher Walken, Scarlet Johansson, Lupita Nyongo, and Garry Shandling

I mentioned in my review of 2015s Cinderella that, remakes, sequels, and formula retreads have littered Disneys productions over the past few decades, but as they say, if its not broke, don't fix it.  That statement remains remarkably true with this years The Jungle Book.

Director Jon Favreau hops the fence from Disneys Marvel studio productions to Disneys, Disney studio productions; I imagine hes eyeing one of those Star Wars spinoffs so he can pull off the Disney hat trick.  As usual, Favreau brings his time-tested bag of tricks along with him to make The Jungle Book far better than it might have been in someone elses hands.  The Jungle Book retells the classic Rudyard Kipling story that also inspired the 1967 Disney animated classic as well as a Disney live-action film in 1994.  After the death of his father at the jaws of the fierce tiger, Shere Khan (Idris Elba), orphaned child Mowgli (Neel Sethi) is taken in by a pack of wolves and raised as one of their own.  As Mowgli ages, his human instincts and ingenuity begin to manifest, causing the fearsome Khan to threaten the pack with his terror if the man-cub is not surrendered.  For his own good, Mowglis wolf-mother Raksha (Lupita Nyongo) entrusts panther, Bagheera (Ben Kingsley) to escort Mowgli through the dense jungle and deliver him to the man-village for his own safety.

Yes, this is a faithful retelling of a story that has been told many times over.  So why do it and why is it worth seeing?  As was the case with 2015s Cinderella, when one decides to tell a familiar story like this, it is important to have a purpose. Fortunately, that is precisely why Favreaus version is successful. From the very start, we are immersed in the jungle landscape with standard-setting visual effects that leave all Jungle Book predecessors in the dust.  Furthermore, that Favreau bag of tricks results in style, fun, and pointed humor that makes the film feel fresh and exciting.  Case in point, opening the film with a neurotic hedgehog frantically claiming any object he finds as mine, voiced by Garry Shandling in what is likely his final role (the film is also dedicated to Shandling in the end credits).  Additionally, the landscapes are breathtaking and the narrative is full of life despite its having only one human character!  Like his work on Elf, Favreau brings a fantasy world to life by relating it so well to our familiar world.  Mowglis metaphorical journey resonates with audiences of all ages because like all good films based on a classic piece of literature, there are layers of appreciation for the central themes including relationships, integrity, and persistence.  Of course, unlike Zootopia from earlier this year, these themes are more or less just there and not executed expertly enough to support the kind of conversation and discussion the story has in book form.

Then there are the performances.  Ive purposefully left this discussion of specific characters for last, as I could never have anticipated how much I was going to enjoy them.  First of all, our sole human actor, Neel Sethi is outstanding as Mowgli.  This kid is athletic, heartwarming, and talented.  Not many kids can carry a $175 million budget film all on their own, let alone on their first try!  But lets get down to it.  Those who know me, know that I have a few cinematic heroes that I don't shut up about: Woody Allen, Christopher Walken, and Bill Murray.  I recently wrote a little retrospective on Walken called Talkin Walken: A Top 10 List, and of course my favorite movie of all time continues to be 1993s Groundhog Day, starring Bill Murray, who I have often written about and whose name is consequently also the name of my dog.  Now both actors have done some stinkers and several of those stinkers involve either voice acting and/or animals, so imagine my trepidation when I heard that these two actors would be voicing roles of animals in a Disney live-action Jungle Book.  Still, like Mowgli I persevered keeping an open mind and hoping for the best.  The first of these two actors to appear is Murray as Baloo the bear.  Let me tell you, as a fan but also a critic, Murray is superb in this role.  Anyone who supported that conversation about how Scarlet Johansson (who also voices a role in this film) deserved an Oscar nomination for voicing an operating system in Her, should be right back at it supporting Bill Murray for this performance.  Yes, that sounds stupid, and thats why that whole conversation was stupid in 2013, but hes just as good.  Thankfully, Favreau and screenwriter Justin Marks had the wherewithal to have Murray sing Bare Necessities and forgo that whole live-action remakes don't include the songs rule.  And speaking of singing, the classically trained singer, dancer, and actor Christopher Walken gets a crack at the films other most memorable number as King Louie with I wanna Be Like You.  There is no appropriate maximum number of times you can hear Christopher Walken say Shooby-Doo or Gigantopithecus.

So it seems the Jungle Book renaissance is just getting underway.  A sequel to this film to be helmed once again by Favreau has already been green lit. Also, this summer a Jungle Book clone in the form of Tarzan (but not the Disney story) will also grace the big screen.  And even more confusingly, motion-capture magician Andy Serkis is directing and starring in his own darker, non-Disney version of The Jungle Book due out in 2018.  B+

The Jungle Book is rated PG and has a running time of 1 hour and 45 minutes.  If you stay a few minutes into the end credits, you will be treated to a reprise of Walkens I Wanna Be Like You, which I of course completely recommend.",1461024000,78,5866,4.807577268195414
7123876,5,B00W605FDO,"""The Jungle Book"" is excellent. This is how the story goes: The man-cub Mowgli flees the jungle after a threat from the tiger Shere Khan. Guided by Bagheera the panther and the bear Baloo, Mowgli embarks on a journey of self-discovery, though he also meets creatures who don't have his best interests at heart.

The cast led by Neel Sethi (in a solid film-making debut performance as Mowgli) and also the voices of Bill Murray (in a superb performance as Baloo), Ben Kinglsey (also superb as Bagheera), Idris Elba (devilishly superb as Shere Khan), Lupita Nyong'o (solid as usual as Raksha), Scarlett Johansson (also solid as Kaa), Giancarlo Esposito (also solid as Akela) & Christopher Walken (sly and superb as King Louie) is excellent. The directing by Jon Favreau (who also produced the film and also does the voice of Pygmy Hog) is excellent. The screenplay (based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling) by Justin Marks is excellent.

The music by John Debney is excellent. The cinematography by Bill Pope is excellent. The film editing by Mark Livolsi is excellent. The casting by Sarah Halley Finn is excellent. The production design by Christopher Glass & Abhijeet Mazumder is excellent. The art direction by Ravi Bansal, John Lord Booth III, Andrew L. Jones & Mike Stassi is excellent. The set decoration by Amanda Moss Serino, set dressings by David L. Bush, Nancy Ann Lai, Glenn Strauss, Adam Zerkel & Merdyce McClaran, set designs by Aric Cheng, David Chow, Richard F. Mays & Julien Pougnier is excellent. The costume design by Laura Jean Shannon is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Issac Hamon, Thomas Robinson Harper & Casey O'Neill is excellent. The special effects supervised by J.D. Schwalm is excellent.

7123882,4,B00W605FDO,"Nine Things About the Film ""The Jungle Book"" (2016)

1. I don't know how many times The Jungle Book has been turned into a movie, but it's more than three. This Disney movie is based on the 1967 Disney cartoon (and has nothing to do with the bizarre 1994 version starring Jason Scott Lee as Mowgli, who falls in love with Lena Headey, looking for treasure in Monkey City).
While this movie follows the Kipling stories, it is totally different interpretation than the original Disney cartoon. It's also my favorite.

2. This is a serious movie. Don't be fooled because the animals talk. This is a full world with it's own mythology. There is danger, death, deception, and tragedy. It's a family movie, but not for the youngest kids. Baloo the bear provides some comic relief, but even that sometimes has an edge.

3. This is not really a remake of the cartoon. The basic plot is the same as the others: Mowgli the ""man-cub"" is a boy living with wolves. Shere Khan is a tiger that wants to eat Mowgli, so Mowgli decides to go find some humans to live with. But the story departs from the cartoon in many key ways. Some scenes are changed, some are deleted, and there are some new plot elements. Shere Khan is a serious villain with a personal vendetta.
Only two of the songs from the animated movie made it into this movie - as very blatant and unnecessary pieces of fanservice - but they are shortened. One of the songs is reinterpreted in a menacing way, which may upset some fans of the original.

4. Jon Favreau directed this movie. I always remember him from Swingers (""You're so money!"") but he also directed Elf, Iron Man and Iron Man 2. He knows what he's doing behind the camera, and the movie is in good hands here.

5. Neel Sethi plays Mowgli. This is Sethi's first movie, and he's pretty amazing. His charisma and personality shine through, even though he's he's actually acting by himself, since he's the only human in the whole damn movie and nothing else on the screen actually exists.

6. This is the most photo-realistic CGI world I've seen. The animals move very realistically, the fur actually looks like fur (animals look wet when it rains!) It's totally beautiful to watch.
[side note: I saw it in 3D, and while it's not totally necessary, it does help you get absorbed into the jungle. And the best 3D effect I've ever seen happens when the credits are almost over. I don't know why they saved it for when everybody has gone].

7. Without making obvious ""morals"" to the story, there are valuable lessons that kids can pick up from this film; Mowgli learns that some rules can be broken under certain conditions. He learns that the world is deceitful, and even your friends can take advantage of you. And he learns that your advantages are also your disadvantages.

8. There are more mature themes in the film, too. There is a layer of myth that holds up the story; for example, there is a reference to the story of Prometheus, and the elephants have sacred roles as the Creators of the Jungle. There are issues of war and peace, strength and fear. Oh, and the introduction of King Louie is straight out of Apocalypse Now.

9. This is the archetypal Hero's Journey, a story told over thousands of years in thousands of ways. But the story still works, because it hits deep into the core of what it means to be human. This epic fable is a great way to tap into our common humanity - even if it's done by talking animals.",1460851200,14,3438,4.496794871794871
7123883,4,B00W605FDO,"No more apparent is the goal of Jon Favreaus The Jungle Book than in its wonderful opening credits.

Rendered in a mix of 3D CG and what appears to be hand-drawn animation, the credits quickly rush us through the traditional Disney castle opening  rendered as if it were drawn in the 1960s  into a lush, incredibly realistic jungle settingand would you believe it? None of it. Not a leaf, not a branch, not a ray of sunshine, is real. And you're going to have a very, very hard time convincing your eyes and brain of that.

Despite taking a low-key detour with 2014s Chef, Jon Favreau has been quietly been building a resume as one of Hollywoods most dependable and innovative blockbuster filmmakers. Its easy to forget that without his hard work on Iron Man and Iron Man 2, he birthed the Marvel Universe. With Elf, he gave us a modern Christmas film for the entire family. And now, with his re-interpretation of The Jungle Book, hes repurposed a Disney classic, retaining its beating heart and joyous family storytelling, while pushing cinema forward with a film that is every bit as innovative and jaw-dropping as James Camerons Avatar.

Theres not much to say about the story of the film  if youve seen the 1967 Disney animated film, youve seen this. But youve never seen it come alive in quite this way.

As the films credits indicate  all of The Jungle Book was filmed in Downtown Los Angeles. The only thing real and true on screen is the debuting Neel Sethi, as man-cub Mowgli. With that exception, every environment and creature is rendered in CG. And somehow, in an age where effect after effect feels artificial and false, this movie populated by talking animals feels just as real and alive as a BBC Nature documentary. Very rarely does the film enter the uncanny valley, and you are along for the thrilling ride as Mowgli looks to learn his proper place in the jungle realm and escape the claws of the villainous tiger Shere Kahn.

The film is helped greatly by an absolute murderers row of Hollywood talent lending their voices. Idris Elba voices Shere Khan with every bit of the bass in his powerful voice striking fear into young Mowgli. Bill Murray plays the laid-back Baloo, with Sir Ben Kingsley adding gravitas to his role as the protective panther Bagheera. Lupita Nyongo again provides solid work in the CG realm as wolf Raksha, and Scarlett Johannsons sultry tones hypnotize as the snake Kaa. Other standouts in the film include Christopher Walkens wonderful work as King Louie (changed here to being a gigantopithecus, from the original orangutan), and the last work of the late Garry Shandling as Ikki, a neurotic porkupine.

But honestly  what stands above everything else is the incredible creations of the graphics team. From motion capture actors and green screens to an incredibly realized living, breathing jungle environment filled with animals, the Moving Picture Company and Weta Digital deserve every single bit of acclaim for making this film come to life. And in that same regard, much how Avatar became all the more immersive in the large-format realm of an IMAX 3D screen, The Jungle Book too should be seen on the largest screen available, complete with 3D glasses, to truly take in the work made by these artists.

In a realm filled with superhero films and animated films, Jon Favreaus The Jungle Book has delivered something for the entire family that pushes filmmaking forward, while retaining what made the 60s classic so great. See it in theaters  don't wait for home video, it won't be anywhere near as engrossing. Give yourself up to the experience  youll love it.",1460851200,5,3612,4.804838709677419
7123884,5,B00W605FDO,"I'm a fan of all of the live-action adaptations Disney has been releasing of their animated classics, but Jon Favreau has left us with something much, much more in The Jungle Book. It's quite literally a perfect film in every wayproduction, cinematography, acting, effects, writingyou name it. This may be the best Disney movie I've ever seen, and it's definitely one of the best films I've seen. You know the story, so I won't bore you there. This is an excellent adaptation by Justin Marks, making a serious film with talking, singing animals that doesn't come off as ridiculous. It just feels natural, like something you see in your everyday life. It's a story full of action, adventure, suspense, humor, and most importantlyheart. It's a story about man's place in the world, but also about how much our learned behavior can triumph our nature. It's a story about family, and how there are ties that bind much stronger than blood. Do yourself a favor & see this film. See it on a massive screen if you can. I look forward to seeing Jon Favreau on stage at The Academy Awards next year.",1460764800,4,1089,4.677083333333333
7123885,3,B00W605FDO,"Unnecessary rehash of the Disney animated favorite finds Mowgli (played here by newcomer Neel Sethi)--a boy literally raised by wolves--being hunted by the redolent Shere Khan, a Bengal tiger with a particularly good reason for being mistrustful of (and spiteful towards) mankind (even ""man cubs""). From there on out, the screenwriters (of which only Justin Marks receives a screen credit) have attempted to merely rearrange certain elements of the original 1967 Walt Disney swansong, without really shedding any new light upon the narrative. The film adapts the older 1967 screenplay by Clemons/Wright/Anderson/Gerry/Norman/Peet more so than the Kipling novel, and therefore we must draw comparisons between this and the final movie that Disney himself worked on. Surprisingly, the latest incarnation of ""The Jungle Book"" really suffers from an identity crisis in terms of cinematic reinvention. Some of the animals can speak, some of them can't. The film includes some of the familiar songs from the old cartoon movie, but it doesn't feel much like a musical this time--in fact, some might argue that it takes itself too seriously. Portions of the film threaten to be scary, but nothing ever really materializes (sadly, Scarlet Johannsson is wasted in her role as Kaa--a role that originally had a male in the speaking part). The film tries to be funny in parts, but much of the jokes in the dialogue fall flat. Christopher Walken is the one bright spot, playing a cool CGI version of King Louie, but even his role is less that what it could have been. I hate to use that old critic's term uneven, but that's the only way I can describe the feel of this picture. If you are going to make an adult film, make an adult film! If you want to pay homage to the cartoons of yesterday, pay homage to the cartoons of yesterday. Alas, today's filmmakers are finding out that they cannot eat their cakes and have them too. Somewhat tragically, ""The Jungle Book"" cannot maintain its hoped for balance between the adulterated real and the childlike imagination. Bagheera, here, is drained of the rather compelling personality that he had in the original film. Bill Murray as Baloo didn't work for me either. After listening to director Jon Favreau describe Walken's Gigantopithecus as a kind of homage to Marlon Brando's Kurtz from the movie APOCALYPSE NOW, I suddenly became aware of the kind of cinematic anxiety of influence that this picture is fond of exhibiting. Can you see Brando launching into a rendition of the song ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" in front of Martin Sheen's Willard? Hmmm, funny, I can't either. Therefore, the tone is broken and the feeling is uncertain. Although the idea of animals respecting animals recalls something of Kipling's original story (bow before the elephants), the resulting movie has too many influences upon it for its own good.
There's no denying that the effects team have gone out of their way to bring us into a world that we haven't seen before, but when one strips the picture of all of these computerized goodies what one is left with is merely another rearranging of story elements (along with the omission of many others). I love any movie set in the jungle--I'm talking everything from PREDATOR to SHEENA to THE GREEN INFERNO to CONGO--partly because it is such a ready made cinematic landscape for gripping adventure tales. But while this new version of the Mowgli story has powerhouse CGI effects that rival that of last year's JURASSIC WORLD, it is obvious that not enough attention was paid to screenplay structure. While it might look like gold, ""The Jungle Book"" doesn't have the joy or the heart required to make us care so much about its dazzling and imaginative images. C-
P.S. I saw this picture in the I-MAX 3-D format at my local theater, and while the images were arresting from a visual standpoint, I was disappointed (yet again) in how the 3-D presentation tried to bring us inside the movie (I was afraid, while watching that early running scene, that the movie was going to be a big blur to the eyes, like that silly MAD MAX rehash was--alas, it settled down finally). The opening 5-4-3-2-1 countdown screen actually has more in-your-face 3-D impact than the actual film does. Oh well, it's only your fifteen bucks, right?",1460764800,7,4277,4.892561983471074

7123887,5,B00W605FDO,"Art + Science = Animatronics, which makes it possible to create a film with fierce life-like animals who interrelate with a human child and no creature is harmed! After all, this Disney production is rated PG, so even though some of the effects may scare the piddle out of a youngster, it will still be family fare. As Rudyard Kipling's classic tale of a boy raised in the jungle comes to life once again, I can't help but smile as I imagine his amazement if he could see what stunning things can be done with his stories these days.

Director Jon Favreau (""Iron Man""), working with Justin Marks who adapted Kipling's book, has stayed reasonably true to the original as the quest for fire becomes a central issue. His blending of CGI and real life is seamless and the involving story sweeps us along at a break-neck speed.

Here are some of the voices:
  * Neel Sethi (in his first feature-length film) is Mowgli, the man cub raised by a pack of wolves, a black panther, and a bear. The motto of the wolf pack is important!
  * Ben Kinglsey (""Exodus: Gods and Kings"") Bageera is one of Mowgli's foster parents. In fact, he's the one who brought a frightened little orphan to the shelter of the wolf pack.
  * Bill Murray (""Fantastic Mr. Fox"") We all love Baloo and are glad to see this happy soul again. The animation is terrific, his dialogue is very funny and he has a good, good heart.
  * Lupita Nyong'o (""Star Wars"") Raksha is a gentle mother, but do NOT threaten her cubs!
  * Scarlett Johansson (""Lucy"") Kaa is a silky-voiced python who can hypnotize Mowgli. She wants to be his close, close friend....
  * Idris Elba (""Zootopia"") Shere Kahn, scarred and half blinded by Man's fire, vows to rid the jungle of humans, particularly Mowgli. His passion for revenge leaps off the screen.
  * Christopher Walken (""Eddie the Eagle"") I always thought King Louie would be associated with Louie Prima, but Walken steps into those iconic shoes and I am impressed!.

All in all, we loved the animals: the porcupine (""It's MINE!""), the elephants in all their majesty, the snoopy armadillo-like critter, the slow-moving tortoises, the darling wolf cubs, the ever-alert meerkat, the lumbering rhinos and the cape buffalo (although their stampede was pretty scary!). I found the monkeys to be upsetting, so to me, that scene lasted a bit too long.

The 3D only made me jump once, although there are several ""Gotcha!"" moments. This movie is a wonder! The story is intelligent, some of the situations are very funny, and Shere Kahn is genuinely terrifying. The children in the audience were riveted! (So was I...)",1460764800,11,2603,4.683516483516484

I was used to the VHS version from the early 90's and I thought it was a bit odd that this DVD is widescreen. The VHS version definitely used a standard screen aspect ratio, so I thought there might have been some cropping to achieve the widescreen aspect. Other reviews can back this up, but it's debatable which aspect is the proper one. While the cropping bothers me a little, there's something that bothers me more. Parts of this movie are interlaced! It's not noticeable throughout the whole movie but certain scenes with a lot of motion have a disgusting combing effect. If they went back to the original film source and recorded it for this DVD, why did they need to apply interlacing? The price of this DVD isn't exactly cheap. Is it a single layer DVD? Maybe they could have sprung for dual layer discs and provided cleaner progressive scan content.",1455494400,,993,4.461538461538462

7124073,2,B00W605FDO,"This rewiew is for the 2015 Blu-Ray re-release of this Disney film that was originally released in 1967.  The Blu-Ray video and audio transfers are very good. According to the introduction by Disney songwriter Richard M. Sherman, this is the very first release in binaural stereo--all prior releases were in monophonic sound. This was the last major production that Walt Disney personally worked on--he died of lung cancer in 1966 before the general release.

The movie itself is OK, but I would not consider it ""Classic"" in the same class as ""Snow White,""  ""Bambi,"" ""Fantasia"" and other earlier projects: The  animation and drawings are good, but not as intricate or elaborate as earlier efforts. The story is also very shallow and saccharine which is probobly appropriate for young children, but does not make for an interesting or memorable movie. According to the commentary track, the original storyline was too dark for Walt. He fired the original production team and re-worked the story into the current ""lighter"" form. I think that the original story probobly would have been better, but that is a matter of taste.

Anyway, I think that there are many better Disney feature cartoons available. Get this only if you are a completist collector or have already seen the move and really like it. Otherwise, spend your money on a something else.",1442448000,,1348,5.0

 THE JUNGLE BOOK was the last movie that Walt Disney directly oversaw. The finished picture in no way resembles Rudyard Kipling's original story, as Disney felt this was too dark for a cartoon. With top notch songs like ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" talented performers and animation that was part Xerox, part hand drawn, ""The Jungle Book"" is a fitting career closer from the greatest name in family motion picture entertainment, Walt Disney.

From this era of Disney, this is clearly one of the most memorable not just for it's amazing soundtrack but also the theme. In many ways, this is the precursor to the Lion King - a young male separated from his parents and raised by animals - but with a much simpler outcome.

This animated, colorful, Walt Disney, delight: THE JUNGLE BOOK, centers around Mowgli - an infant boy, who ends up alone within a jungle. Bagheera the wise and kindly, old Panther, finds Mowgli and realizing that he needs attentive care which is something that he cannot give him, places Mowgli's' basket crib near the den of a Mother Wolf, who had recently given birth to a litter of wolf cubs. Rama - the Father Wolf, allowed the Man Cub Mowgli, too stay with the Wolf Herd, until he was 10 years old. Why ten? Because in the tenth year, a fearsome and dreaded stalker, named: Shere Khan the terrorizing Tiger, returned to that part of the jungle where the Wolf Herd and the Man Cub roamed, stayed and played, together. Knowing that a pack of wolves was no match for a large and ferocious Tiger, especially like Shere Khan, the Wolf Pack met and had a council meeting. And, it was with great reluctance, decided that Shere Khan ""...will surely kill the boy and all who protect him"" and that he'd be better off, with his own kind. Humans. The Panther Bagheera offers to escort Mowgli to the nearest village of settlers, but Mowgli prefers to stay within the jungle that he's grown to love. Taking matters into his own young hands, he eludes Bagheera, so that he wouldn't have to be placed with his own kind. Human beings. His jungle odyssey, animal encounters, included: Baloo the carefree Bear, King Louie and his band of Orangutans, Colonel Hathi and his Elephant Troop, Kaa the self-serving, hypnotic Snake and then finally, he has a face-to-face confrontation with Shere Khan the Tiger. And each depicted animal encounter is a lesson in life for the Man Child, Mowgli. But by then, the jungle animals had adopted him as one of their own and having formed friendships, there was one animal within the human jungle that all the jungle animals and even Mowgli himself, could not help but be smitten by. A young and pretty, female human. How does it all, play out? That... Dear Reader, is for you and your family, too see! In addition too, hearing melodic songs by: Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman with Music and Orchestration by: George Burns and Walter Sheets, respectively. Then, you will quickly see, just why THE JUNGLE BOOK is a delightful, Walt Disney, Animated Classic.

7124272,4,B00W605FDO,"I purchased this for my daughter through Amazon Instant Video. I had no trouble with my purchase, no picture problems or play issues. I was expecting the picture to be dull, considering the age of the movie, but it is not. In fact I'd say the picture is more vibrant than I remember it. My daughter was happy with the movie and she is used to Pixar, high detail, fancy schmancy type quality in the movies she watches now. I guess some things really are timeless and Disney does have kids' entertainment down to a science.

The only reason why I take off a star is because I think this movie is too violent for a young child. I honestly would not show this to a kid under age 6. My daughter is 3 and I wish I had waited a while. She is a total scaredy cat though and HIGHLY impressionable so use your own judgement, but for us this was VERY inappropriate for my daughter's age.

I was sitting with my daughter and during the fighting scenes I was covering her eyes. I hadn't seen this movie since I was about 10 years old (I'm almost 30) and I had completely forgotten how graphic and sad it had gotten in some scenes. In the end I couldn't remember if Baloo died or not (I haven't read the book in years either and couldn't remember how they differed) and I was literally sobbing (darn hormones) through the last parts of the movie. My daughter was in my lap with her head buried in my shoulder saying, ""Is he gonna be okay? Is he? Is he?"" I can't believe my parents let me and my brother watch this when we were my daughter's age! If I had remembered it I would never have allowed my daughter to see it until she was MUCH older!

Not only that, but there's a lot of hitting, punching, and swatting in the movie which is partly playful boyishness and partly because Mowgli's a kid raised by wolves... hello. But my daughter is too little to get that. She is in a hitting phase right now which we have been trying to nip in the bud. Now her favorite excuse for hitting and swatting if she gets mad is that she's being a ""man cub."" I so, so, so wish I had remembered that from my own childhood (this was one of my favorite movies as a kid and I foolishly and impulsively bought it and played it immediately without pre-screening it...) but I kind of expected more from Disney! I guess I was forgetting about the PTSD I suffered from watching Pinocchio and Bambi as a kid. I'll remember to prescreen next time!",1423008000,,2407,4.239651416122005

7124284,5,B00W605FDO,"This is a wonderful, mystical film about an orphaned Indian boy named Mowgli who grows up in the jungle around animals. We have the wolves who raised him, the panther Bagheera who watches over him, Kaa the python who wants to eat him, Baloo the bear who wants to befriend him, the monkeys who kidnap him and bring him to King Louie the orangutan, who wants to be like him, and Shere Khan the tiger, who also wants to prey on him. Mowgli ventures away from them all and some vultures take pity on him and try to help him out. Eventually he finds a village with people and is entranced by a girl whom he follows. That ends his time spent in the jungle. Excellent story and music, highly enjoyable to watch.",1421625600,,704,4.3007518796992485

So naturally Disney, with his dying breath put a halt to that, removing writer Bill Peet and composer Terry Gilkyson from the project.  It was also Disney's idea to make the vultures look and sound like The Beatles.  He even wanted them to voice the characters and sing the song, ""That's What Friends Are For.""  John Lennon was not amused by the suggestion.  The movie was released 10 months after Disney died.  It was a huge success.  The song The Bare Necessities was nominated for an Oscar but lost to Talk to the Animals.

This movie boasts a lot of established actors for the voice work, most of whom did little to hide their trademark voices (conjuring up unwanted images of the actors as the characters spoke).  How many times did they need Winnie the Pooh (Sterling Holloway) to unofficially `appear' in so many movies, sounding exactly like Sterling Holloway?  In this case, it's impossible to think of Winnie the Pooh as a sneaky snake.

This movie has a lot of great songs, considerable humor, and only a smidgen of danger.  It's always a joy to watch.",1418083200,,1188,4.685990338164252

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Mowgli [Bruce Reitherman] the man-cub has been raised by wolves in the Indian jungle since his birth. However, when the wolves learn that the ferocious tiger Shere Kahn [George Sanders] is making his way through the jungle and is looking for food, they decide to send Mowgli to a local man tribe to be safe. On his way to the village he meets a host of interesting, funny, scary and friendly characters that all find Mowgli fascinating, one of these characters - Baloo the Bear [Phil Harris] becomes firm friends with Mowgli and helps him on his travels. But Shere Khan is never far away.

The Jungle Book was Walt Disney's 19th animated feature and was released too much acclaim in 1967. Loosely based on the Rudyard Kipling novel of the same name, the screenwriters removed some of the darker content so as not to scare the younger audience. This is one of the main reasons why it has such a wide appeal to any age group.

From the opening scenes where the Wolves have to move Mowgli, we were entranced into how he would develop as a human alongside the animals, but also would he be able to evade Shere Khan or become another one of his mighty conquests. Whilst quite a savage idea initially, the story really comes into its own when the cast of characters pop up along the way. The wise, old Panther Bagheera who dishes out some sound advice for the young boy, is a joy and he also becomes a guiding light for Mowgli in his travels.

One of our favourite parts of The Jungle Book is the visit to the palace of crazy King Louie the orang-utan, and he is one of the most crazy characters Disney have ever produced! But we can't help but laugh at his ruling antics over his subjects and his singing.

The way the animators and voice cast put evilness into Shere Khan and Kaa the snake will never be forgotten no matter what age we are and they are two of the most dangerous and frightening characters ever seen on screen. However, the story is lightened up by the appearance of Baloo the Bear, a slow moving, no-troubles type character that is loved by all and hated by none. His love of Mowgli is a wonder to see, and it really shows towards the end of the film.

But we always want to hear him sing The Bear Necessities, a song that has lasted throughout the years and never gets old. There is something very fitting about the song, and Phil Harris [voice of Baloo] had such a wonderfully dulcet tone to his voice that it never moves throughout the whole range. We wish we had a Baloo to keep us company!

The animation is some of the best Walt Disney has ever produced. The animals are incredibly drawn with such precision it must have taken hours for each cell to be made. But what really stands out is the background artwork; having most of the film set in the jungle would have been tricky but the artists that worked on the background have done such a masterful job. It's difficult to ignore what is happening in the background, with just the leaves of a tree floating to the ground or the steady water running down stream.

The Jungle Book was also the first time that many of the primary vocal artists in an animated Disney animation film were stars in their own right. Disney animated features had always been well cast but only rarely with easily recognizable star voices. Here, apart from the voice of Mowgli, the voice talent on display was stellar, and the roles couldn't be better or more ingratiatingly cast. Phil Harris walks away with the picture as the easy-going Baloo, Sterling Holloway hisses coyly as Raa, and Sebastian Cabot grounds the film rather regally as Bagheera. And no one can do haughty and intimidating like George Sanders.

Blu-ray Video Quality  The film is presented at a 1.75:1 aspect ratio and is delivered in 1080p resolution. For those who found the scrubbed look of previous releases like 'The Sword in the Stone' problematic, there won't be any relief from worry with this release. Grain is once again a mere memory, and the DNR [Digital Noise Reduction] applied has a deleterious effect on fine-line animation like whiskers on the animals, which seem to fade in and out if one looks closely. Motion sometimes gets affected by the processing, too, blurring certain shots strangely. Sharpness ebbs and flows as well with all the processing especially in certain shots that aren't close-ups. Colour is balanced and strong without any bleeding, and there is no banding to be seen. Please Note: Playback Region B/2 and C/3: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound mix doesnt make full use of that wide soundstage, but it certainly is the best the film as ever sounded on home video. The musical numbers find themselves spread through the available channels and occasionally some of George Bruns background score is also expanded beyond the front soundstage, and there is one neat effect where a voices echoes bounce around the rears. But most of the dialogue has been placed in the centre channel.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Introductions [1080p] [2:00] Diane Disney-Miller and songwriter Richard Sherman give separate introductions to the film. They are brief, but nice all the same.

Special Feature: Never Seen Before: Insuring a Future for Wildlife and Wild Places [4:00] Is a commercial promoting Disney's positive work with nature's creatures, from their extensive cinematic history to the Animal Kingdom theme park in Orlando, Florida.

Special Feature: Alternate Ending: Mowgli and the Hunter [1080p] [9:00] There's a brand new ""recently discovered"" alternate ending for the movie which apparently they'd only had a script for, so a present day artist storyboarded the whole idea out and animated and narrated it and is animated, sketch-y storyboard form. To be honest, it's an absolutely terrible idea for an ending, and I can see why it got scrapped and lost. In this version, Mowgli goes to the village, while meeting a new hunter villain, and finds his original parents. After living with them for a short while, he goes back to the jungle. The hunter then believes there's treasure in the jungle and goes to the ape city to try to get it. There's also a showdown with Shere Khan that ends in his death. The version seen in the finished film is infinitely better.

Special Feature: Growing Up With Nine Old Men [2013] [45:00] For those who don't know, Disney's Nine Old Men were the original group of core animators who worked for Walt Disney. The bonus short features Ted speaking with the other ""kids"" the grown-up sons and daughters of Walt Disney's Nine Old Men. I found this bonus feature very charming, and it was interesting to glimpse into the world of the Nine Old Men from a different point of view. Ted Thomas is an amiable and folksy interviewer, and clearly has a kinship with those who went through a similar childhood as he did.

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Richard Sherman (half of the song-writing team), Andreas Deja (current Disney animator and fan of the film), and Bruce Reitherman (voice of Mowgli and son of the director): Consider this audio track a master class in professional appreciation: each participant extols the virtues of the ""Jungle Book,"" from the character animation quirks to the unforgettable soundtrack. While it lacks a coldly informational tone, it's nonetheless a treat to hear those connected to the production point out the idiosyncrasies of the animation film. For added historical oomph, archival audio recordings of Larry Clemmons (screenwriter), Ollie Johnston (animation legend), and Wolfgang Reitherman (director) are included in the discussion.

Special Feature: The Bare Necessities: The Making of The Jungle Book [2007] [480i] [46:27] This is a really marvellous encapsulation of how the film came to be and Walt Disney's lasting impressions. This documentary is one of the most interesting and revealing on any of the Disney classics, not shying away from some of the turmoil that occurred behind-the-scenes before The Jungle Book made it to the screen.

Special Feature: Music and More: Deleted Songs [21:00] Presents the full work of composer Terry Gilkyson, who was replaced by the Sherman Brothers once Walt Disney decided to flip The Jungle Book project sunny-side up. The songs collected here seem more suited to a Rankin/Bass special than a feature film, but it's an invaluable piece of history, allowing viewers a rare listen to the film's more ambitious origins. The audio quality is a little rough and possibly from a phonograph source, and contains the tracks: ""Brothers All;"" ""The Song of the Seeonee;"" ""The Bare Necessities"" (a demo version of the lone song that wasn't discarded); ""Monkey See; Monkey Do;"" ""I Knew I Belonged To Her;"" ""In A Day's Work"" and ""The Mighty Hunters"" and if you want to know why the heart of rock & roll has stopped beating, watch this train wreck of a cover song.

Special Feature: Sing Along With The Movie: Disney Song Selection [13:00] Offers up some karaoke, with the songs ""Colonel Hathi's March; ""Bare Necessities;"" ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" and ""That's What Friends Are For."" You can view the scenes with or without lyrics.

Special Feature: Deleted Scenes: The Lost Character [7:00] Rocky the Rhino is a short feature exploring the deleted character of Rocky, a dim-witted rhinoceros (voiced by Frank Fontaine) who factored into Mogwli's interaction with the Beatlesque vultures. Walt just wasn't feeling the continual aggression toward the Man-Cub was benefiting the animation film's pace, thus a removal of Rocky and a slight reinvention of the vultures was in order. Rocky's scene is presented here in a series of fully-voiced storyboards.

Special Feature: Disneypedia [480i] [14:00] Here we take a trip into the jungles of India to learn about the real life counterparts to your favourite animals that you see in the Disney animation film The Jungle Book.

Finally, The Jungle Book is an exquisite family film that never becomes old, no matter how many times you see it. The animation film feels like it could live on forever and especially with this brand new UK exclusive Disney Diamond Limited Edition SteelBook Blu-ray, which is only available to us in the United Kingdom. The quality is breath taking and does the animation film justice with a great selection of added extras that will keep the family entertained for hours. The animation is beautifully crafted, the story is heart-warming and the songs just put a huge smile on your face, which you will automatically sing-a-long to. A classic in every sense of the term and that is why I am so proud to have this in my Walt Disney Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

7124585,5,B00W605FDO,"Ordered for our grandson who is almost 2--
he loves the music and will dance along at times
This is great animated film--rich colors and great details--
the voices of the characters are perfect ---so distinct to each character--bumptious, sly, pompous, and very slitherinly snakey--
many more current animated films use voice overs that are often generic and interchangeable -- even though they might use name stars, they seem to be more for star value than for how well they portray the characters' personalities...

Disney has had a mixed bag of animated films but this one is from its Golden Age...
ordered several -- like Dumbo and Fox and Hound to share with him...",1403827200,2,670,4.87719298245614

7124597,5,B00W605FDO,This Movie was great when I watched with my children and it is still great watching it with my Grandchildren.,1402358400,,109,4.5
7124598,5,B00W605FDO,"When I first watched this, I was amazed at the vibrant colors in the animation.  The sound is fantastic on a 5.1 home theater system.  Disney did a great job remastering the original so that it looks and sounds great.

One thing that I really like about this movie is that when you pause it, it shifts into intermission mode, and starts a sing-along complete with animation.  It rotates through several of the more popular songs in the movie if you let it run.  When someone needs to take a quick break, the fun keeps right on rolling even though the movie is paused.",1402185600,6,567,4.413461538461538
7124599,5,B00W605FDO,I personally love this movie. I am enjoying it as well as others here. I am a fan. Thank you so very much,1402099200,,105,3.608695652173913

7124601,5,B00W605FDO,they sing the songs and have already watched it over and over.  A total winner.  Would recommend to anyone with kids under 8.,1402012800,,125,4.391304347826087
7124602,5,B00W605FDO,"Being the last animation that the late Walt Disney was involved with, The Jungle Book is another great classic.  Anyone watching this movie now will immediately be struck by the smooth, flowing movement of the animation, the leisurely and sensible pacing of the story, and the appropriate match between the musical soundtrack and the setting.

Current Disney cartoon animations rely too heavily on CGI (computer-generated imagery), frantic pacing and dialog, and employ music that doesn't fit the era or the setting of the plot.  The current character voices also consistently use the same tired urban slang-infused lines even in period pieces.  Walt must be rolling in his grave now.  Don't get me wrong on the choice of music.  The jazz music soundtrack for The Jungle Book wouldn't normally fit a jungle setting but it doesn't stray too far unlike the generic top 40 pop music that peppers period pieces today.  Example: the ""Frozen"" title song against an old European setting.  It's pop with a tinge of....modern country!

The Blu-Ray edition of The Jungle Book appears to reveal the same treatment that other classic Disney animations have received.  Color saturation has been increased (probably more than what was originally intended), contrast has been increased, and the overall appearance is more solid and clean.  Personally, I see it as an improvement because it helps to anchor the viewer's attention to the story.  The sound has also been updated to 21st century standards.  Whereas the original release was stereo then later re-released in matrixed Dolby Surround, the current Blu-Ray and DVD versions have been remixed for 5.1 surround.  The result is clean, dynamic, enveloping surround ambience as well as various sound effects appropriately placed in the surround channels according to specific scene details (picture birds flying behind you and King Louie's monkeys taunting Baloo The Bear from behind you while Baloo is in front of you, putting you in the middle of the action).

This one's a keeper.",1401926400,9,2021,5.1753846153846155
7124603,5,B00W605FDO,"I absolutely loved this movie as a kid and love that my kids can enjoy it now too, anywhere they want!",1401840000,,102,3.9047619047619047

7124612,3,B00W605FDO,Characters and animation were good. Scary parts that need fast forwarding. Not as much singing as advertised. Prompt delivery for all three ordered. Maybe I should let one set of grandchildren rate movies before I order for all sets.,1401235200,2,233,5.0
7124613,4,B00W605FDO,I bought this movie for my 2 year old who loves animals.  I was looking for a movie that was simple and easy to understand for a 2 year old.  I like that there is nothing commercial about the movie.  It is a oldie but a goodie.,1401235200,,227,3.7872340425531914

Disney classics just don't lose their magic between generations!  Now my grand daughter loves to sing ""The Bear Necessities!""

So, the Diamond Edition is supposed to be a great new line of releases, packed with extras, but honestly there's not too much new here.  The Platinum Edition (the bonus features of which are still here) seems to have covered it all.  Still, the HD transfer is amazing to look at and the digital copy inclusion is a great bonus, as always, but even more now with Disney's new Movies Anywhere app.

If it's not in your collection, grab it.  If it is, and you are a Disney fan, upgrade to the HD transfer, but keep the old one around for fun!",1397520000,5,650,4.521367521367521

7124663,3,B00W605FDO,"I will preface this by saying Disney's The Jungle Book has never been one of my favorite classic ""Vault Disney"" movies.  That being said, I am a huge Disney buff and enjoy just about anything the studio has put out in terms of Theatrical Animation with very few exceptions (read: Home on the Range, Chicken Little).

SPECIAL FEATURES:

There are some great special features on here including an alternate ending in story board form that I never even knew existed.  Spoiler free: I'll just say I am glad that they didn't go with the overly dark and non-Disney alternate ending!  The songs (for example ""Bare Necessities"") are all relatively as catchy as ever, the characters are mostly like-able (Baloo, etc.), and the animation is beautifully well-restored.

REVIEW:

Where my rating drops from the traditional 5 stars I would give to a classic Disney movie of this nature to the 3 stars I did rate it, is in that this movie unlike say Cinderella or Beauty & the Beast feels very dated.  That is despite the restoration and remastering of the audio in full HD, the movie is still left feeling antique.  I can't quite put my finger on it, but movies that are just as old like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty just don't have this same ""dated"" feeling.

Back in the 90's there were many tie-ins to the characters such as TaleSpin and The Jungle Book 2, as well as Disney World/Land attractions.  However, there are really no ""current"" or ""modern"" tie-ins to these characters that I am aware of (although I've read of multiple upcoming Live-Action motion pictures in the works).

Therefore, if you're considering purchasing this for your kids, I think you would be safer to pass on this one and go with one of the many other classic Disney animations such as Cinderella, Aladdin, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty & the Beast, etc.  I think The Jungle Book comparatively will quickly lose your kids attention spans and there aren't really any relatable characters to children.

RECOMMENDATION:

If you currently own the Platinum edition DVD release on the last vault cycle, the additional special features not contained on the Platinum edition do not warrant an upgrade in my opinion, nor does the albeit impressive at times HD picture and sound.  With upconversion a standard on current blu-ray players automatically upgrading your dvd to ""relative hi-def"", the only time you would notice any difference in picture or audio quality would be if you have an obscenely large tv (read: 65+ inches) or a killer 7.1 surround sound audio setup.  If you're an 80's kid or earlier, or grew up watching TaleSpin on the Disney afternoon block, or you are just a huge Disney fan like I am, is the only reasoning I would give to list this as a ""must buy"".",1397433600,4,2727,4.768085106382979

7124675,5,B00W605FDO,"I would say Snow White is Disney's greatest accomplishment--especially considering a full-length animated feature had never been done. Sleeping Beauty had the best backgrounds. The Jungle Book has the best characters. The basic story is rather simplistic: A boy really needs to return to the man-village as the jungle is too dangerous for him--even with the help of his animal friends. What really works is the personalities of the characters, allowing the voice actors to really shape the character rather than just read off a script. Add to that some catchy tunes from the Sherman brothers and you've got one of Disney's best accomplishments before he passed.",1397088000,,661,5.186915887850467

7124817,5,B00W605FDO,"As I post this review there are already over 700 reviews of this film. I would like to point out that Amazon has a policy of combining all formats of a film (theater, DVD, Bluray and Amazon Instant) together when providing reviews. I always recommend that those seeking a review of a DVD or Bluray sort by date  you can choose newest first  - and then look to see which format the reviewer is discussing.  Some of the reviews here go back to 2007 even before Bluray! This review is of the Bluray Combo pack version (including the Bonus Features).

I won't spend a lot of time discussing the film itself because  honestly  its a classic. Yes, its only 78 minutes long (just over an hour) but it has five great songs in it. Ill let you read others comments on the story ( an adaptation of Rudyard Kiplings stories) but Ill point out that one of the NEW special features this time is an 8-minute featurette where we see the story booked  version  of a recently discovered alternate ending, which is narrated by one of the new generation of Disney animators.

The Bluray version looks great. Its really sharp. Of course, it is so sharp that the black outlines of each hand drawn character (yes, this was made before computers!) are clearly visible. No, Im not complaining; just pointing out for the CGI generation.

The bonus features are divided into two sections:  The new ones show up first and then there is a section for the Classic bonuses from prior editions of the films home video release. The new ones include: a nine-minute interview with composer Richard Sherman,  an 18-minute one on the Animal Kingdom Disney Park (only tangentially related to the film), a 9-minute feature on Disneys in-house SPARK program where animators can pitch  new ideas to their peers.  And Bear-E-Oke, which lets you sing along to the five songs. This last feature isn't that necessary either since the Classic Bonuses includes the option to jump to the same songs with subtitles to sing along with.  So, honestly, the best bonus is the Sherman interview though an upgrade to this addition - for those who treasure the film and have an HD TV and BD player  is the print itself.

I think Walt would be very happy with this new release of the last film he was personally involved with.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7124818,4,B00W605FDO,"Walt Disney Home Entertainment pulls another classic out of the vault and delivers it in a brand new high-definition package. ""The Jungle Book"" is the latest jewel in the crown of the Mouse House to hit Blu-ray in a Diamond Edition. The release will no doubt have Disney fans everywhere clapping their hands in glee.

Mowgli is a boy raised in the jungle since infancy by the animals. As he grows older, he journeys into the wild to discover who he is. He's accompanied on his trip by a bear named Baloo, who helps keep him safe as he meets all sorts of friendly and malicious creatures along the way.

""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition is presented in 1080p High Definition with an aspect ratio of 1.75:1. The picture is clear and the colors of the jungle and its creatures are vibrant and warm. There will be some complaints that the film is too clean and has lost its original cinematic flavor because of its digital upgrade. I found it to be a pleasant watch visually, however.

A 7.1 DTS-HD mix was given for ""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition. It enhances all the song numbers and atmospheric noises one would expect to hear in the jungle. The surround sound mix is something Walt Disney himself probably never imagined possible. It really beefs up the home viewing experience.

""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition includes over two hours of bonus material. There's behind-the-scenes featurettes like ""Sparking Creativity,"" ""Music, Memories, Mowgli,"" and I Wan'na Be Like You."" ""Bear-E-Oke"" Sing-Along will get the children in your household whooping and hollering in joy. Special Introductions to the movie are provided by Diane Disney Miller and Richard M. Sherman. We also get an alternate ending, ""Disneypedia: Junglemania,"" and more.

Lovers of all things Disney will find ""The Jungle Book"" Diamond Edition an absolute must-have addition to their home entertainment library. I wish I could say I appreciate this release as much as others. However, I don't find it as charming and irresistible as some. There's too much song and dance and not enough action for my tastes. Kids love it and that's all that counts in the end.",1394064000,2,2130,4.87292817679558

It's a fairly quick scene as Mogli ties a fiery branch on Shere Khan's tail and he runs frantically back to the forest, leaving children laughing.

Picture is great - story is pretty good. I would rate this a very good 8.5 to 9.0 - just shy of being great. This movie seems to be passed over sometimes during discussions about what Disney movies are thought to be among the best 3 or 4 which seems a little unfair to me.

Music is super and voice talent was great.

I would recommend this for animation fans,  Disney fans and anyone young at heart - how can 'The Bare Necessities' not bring a smile to your face!!",1393286400,,699,4.1940298507462686

The fact that this classic movie from 1964 is now available to be streamed on any device at any time is magical. Its truly inspirational how far technology has gone.

7124893,1,B00W605FDO,"I can't believe that Disney actually did this! I just viewed my new Blu-ray of The Jungle Book Diamond Edition.

First off; I noticed that the movie was widescreen. Now, I own the original DVD and have also owned the VHS and the Laserdisc as well and I can assure you that this movie was never widescreen! I went back to my DVD and viewed it. Upon comparison, I noticed that in order for Disney to make it widescreen, they had to crop off the top and bottom of the picture. In some scenes it even cuts off Baloo's head feet.

I feel so sad and sorry for the original artists who worked so hard on this movie. All that beautiful animation they did has been cut off. It's sad! I'm not sure why Disney would do this. All I can tell you is that it's almost unwatchable! They didn't do it to Bambi or Alice in Wonderland, So why Jungle Book. I've been waiting for this Blu-ray release for years.

I have some fond childhood memories of this film. My dear Grandmother took me to see this movie when I was a kid. It was this first time she ever took me out alone. A wonderful day. It's a treasured memory for me. But now Disney has managed to crush the viewing of it. If they wanted to give the new kid viewers a screen that fills the TV, they should have given us both versions in the set or at least given a choice when purchasing.

Secondly; If you try to pause the film for whatever reason, after 5 seconds, the screen automatically goes to a narrative screen about the movie that CAN NOT be bypassed. It's very irritating!

I'm going to return this Jungle Book Blu-ray. Hopefully it will send a message to Disney...Maybe they'll get it!",1392422400,23,1634,4.258064516129032

7124904,2,B00W605FDO,"This cartoon was ANIMATED in a ratio of 1.37. Disney claim it was designed to be framed later at 1.75 as is the case with this release. However although it is true many cinemas did show it at the wide ratio in the US this was not always the case in other markets where it was widely shown using the full original animation. It is also fact that all early video releases were in the full frame ratio. Even the most cursory comparison will show the wide screen cut loses a huge amount of the frame and is tight and very unsatisfactory. I have compared this with my full frame DVD and I have not the slightest reservation in stating that that is the release I would have preferred on Blu-ray. I do not like this transfer at all despite the obvious technical improvements as it completely fails to grab the soul of the production. Shame on you Disney, you have also wrecked Robin Hood and The Sword in the Stone in the same way! If you have the old full frame DVDs keep them as they will become a treasure. If you can find a copy grab it as it is just so much better",1392163200,11,1062,4.160194174757281
7124905,2,B00W605FDO,"Overall, I am happy with my purchase. i love the movie and think the quality of the picture is great. One thing I am very disappointed with is the packaging. All my other Diamond Edition movies I have purchased the DVD and Blu Ray which have a blue rim around the slip cover as well as DVD and also the cover art takes over the entire DVD. I purchased the movie anyway, although I have found images on google that show the actually DVD cover I prefer. I will even be contacting the disney home entertainment hotline to determine if they will releasing a DVD and Blu ray only version that will match the other DVDs with a blue rim. I just cant quite understand why they would do this change. Has only heard of a later release of the simple blu ray and DVD edition or know where I can buy it? Despite my love for the movie the packaging has really ruined it for me",1392163200,2,862,4.167664670658683

7124907,5,B00W605FDO,Bought as present; the kids really loved it. It is a great classic by Disney. Can hardly beat the music.,1392076800,,104,4.25
7124908,5,B00W605FDO,"I hadn't seen Disney's The Jungle Book in at least 15 years but I was surprised by how much of the movie I remembered - even the animal's iconic expressions were burnt into my memory! What I never experienced as a kid, though, was how absolutely GORGEOUS this movie is.

The Blu Ray transfer is a work of art! The jungle foliage provides plenty of opportunity for animators to show off their craft, and they certainly do. This may be one of the most visual Disney movies ever. I was entranced by the animation this go around, with my adult eye, but even still the story is great fun. Not the most complex plot in the Disney canon, but fabulous none the less. Also, the aspect ratio of this movie is 1.75:1 which means it will fill up your whole TV.

OVERALL: I buy pretty much all the Disney blu rays, especially anything from the Diamond series, but their new transfers still amaze me. This one exceeded even my high expectations. It truly is like watching it again for the first time. If you've ever been a fan of The Jungle Book, even just a teeny tiny bit, try watching it again in 1080p. You'll be blown away and have a new love for the movie - guaranteed!",1391990400,4,1161,4.321100917431193
7124909,5,B00W605FDO,"I took my boys to see this film when it first came out and then I bought a record w/the songs on it and my boys, now have children of there own and they still talk about it.",1391990400,,173,3.5789473684210527
7124910,5,B00W605FDO,"Although Bambi, Dumbo and Lady and the Tramp are my favorite classic Disney titles, The Jungle Book holds a special place in my heart. My mother took me and my brother to see it on the big screen shortly before she died, and it was the only animated Disney film we saw together at the cinema. I remember that we were late and missed a few minutes, so we watched the rest of the film, Treasure Island, and then sat through all of The Jungle Book again afterwards. I only asked to see the few minutes we had missed, but we couldn't bring ourselves to leave at that point.

I don't think I have seen the film since that day around 40 years ago, so I wondered whether my treasured memory would be ruined by seeing it again as an adult. I'm happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.

Walt Disney's last major animated film is a feel-good story suitable for the whole family. The story is simple: Mowgli is a small child who is discovered by Bagheera the panther in the Indian Jungle. After giving the matter some thought, he decides that the local wolves would provide the best home for the boy. Ten years quickly pass during a narrated scene and we skip ahead to the current day. The wolves have heard that the tiger, Shere Khan, is back in the neighborhood. He hates humans and will likely seek out Mowgli to kill him. Don't worry, I promise that your children won't be frightened by the story.

Mowgli is befriended by a small elephant, and also has the help of Bagheera, who decides to deliver the boy to a village so that he can be among his own kind. Along the way they encounter Baloo the bear, who is the life and soul of the film. He's not too bright, but his heart is in the right place and it's easy to love him.

Like most Disney classics, the story contains plenty of songs. The most notable is Bare Necessities, sung by Baloo, and it was nominated for an Oscar. There are four other songs, including King of the Swingers, which is almost as much fun as Bare Necessities.

The 78-minute story seems to be over all too quickly, but you could always watch it twice as I did all those years ago. I could imagine small children loving the colors, the music, and the bright characters that populate the entire movie.

The Diamond Edition  Blu-ray boasts a 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track, as well as the original mono track, and 5.1 Dolby Digital versions in French, Spanish and Portuguese. The picture is free of dirt and debris and looks as clear as a watercolor painting could possibly look. Be aware that these hand-painted Disney classics do not have the depth of modern CGI images, but the story is strong enough to make you focus on what's happening in the foreground. I was very happy with the presentation.

As well as features from the Classic DVD, this latest version includes the following:

Music, Memories and Mowgli: A Conversation with Richard M. Sherman, Diane Disney Miller and Floyd Norman (9:42)
Alternate Ending - Mowgli and the Hunter (unfinished animation in storyboard form) (8:46)
I Wan'na Be Like You: Hanging Out at Disney's Magic Kingdom (18:25)
Bear-e-oke (5 songs)
@disneyanimation: Sparking Creativity (9:14)

The package comes with an embossed slip cover and a DVD.

For any Disney fan who hasn't seen The Jungle Book, the Blu-ray is a great way to experience it for the first time. I would also recommend it as an upgrade for owners of the DVD.

One would expect this to have a detrimental effect but it all works in the movie's favor. It's basically a string of sketches and set pieces cobbled around a loose narrative, though it flies by quickly, especially when Baloo is on the screen.

Mowgli is a man-cub abandoned in the jungles of India and raised by wolves when Bagheera, a concerned panther, steps in and rescues him. Around 10 years later Bagheera tries to take him back to the man village but they are sidetracked by a variety of animals including Kaa, the snake, and lovable, floppy-armed King Louie, an orangutan who wants the secret of fire.

Much of the movie has a late-60s jazz theme which keeps it moving and jiving. The jungle animation, making great use of multi-plane cameras, is absolutely gorgeous, and makes every scene a joy to look at, even during some of the lulls (anything with the Elephants).

It's easy to see why it has become a classic as the characters are brilliant. Baloo and Co. came back in TaleSpin 23 years later and secured their status among the most popular Disney characters.

The Blu-ray looks absolutely gor-gee-ous in 1.75:1 1080p. You won't believe your eyes at how bright and colorful this 46-year-old animation looks. It's flawless. The sound is in very good DTS HD-MA 7.1 with lots of spacious effects and surrounds. Extras are fair, but hardly extensive.",1378944000,,1853,5.981132075471698

7125007,4,B00W605FDO,"Disney Studios 19th full length animated feature film from the Disney studios. The Jungle Book breathed new life into the Disney animated films after the so-so Sword in the Stone. By this time Walt was busy with other projects and had little Time to spend overseeing the animated films. The new Xerography process while being a cost saving achievement did not make these newer films better in my opinion, in fact they just don't have the Disney luster we've all become accustomed to.

Fortunately, The Jungle Book is one of Disney's best from this time period and because of the luke warm reception of Sword in the Stone Walt had a lot more to do with this film than that one. The Jungle Book has extremely memorable characters and has some of the best songs to grace any Disney film. The animation process has been fleshed out more and the new process isn't as jarring as it seemed in Sword and the Stone. I can only imagine what this film would have looked like if it were done without the Xerography process. The artwork is beautiful in the film, but it is a totally different style. The rougher lines on the drawings being exposed just comes across like their unpolished. This process worked well with this film, Winnie the Pooh and 101 Dalmatians though, but after ending the traditional process with the fabulous looking Sleeping Beauty, (yes one scene used this process a sort of trial) these films looks very 2 dimensional and just don't seem to have the same magical look to them.

OK, now about the film and video releases. I have owned both DVD releases and now the Blu Ray release and they all have their good points and bad points. the first release has no bonus features, but is in the superior full screen format. While the restoration isn't as impressive as the newer release, it looks very good and actually helps to soften the rough lines in the animation. The newer release has been restored and looks great, but the widescreen presentation is cramped chopping off heads and feet in some scenes. Also the rough lines are more exaggerated. The EASY solution (Disney I'm talking to YOU!) would have been to include BOTH formats.

*****BLU RAY UPDATE******

The new Blu Ray release looks fabulous, but it does not include the full screen version of the film.
This is disappointing news for purist.

******END OF UPDATE*****

If I had to choose one edition I would keep my Limited issue DVD as the Full Screen Film is really what's important here. I would like to see it sparkle like the new edition, but I prefer the presentation in full screen rather than widescreen. It was shown both ways in theaters so why not offer both? The film is short enough and the extras don't take up that much space. I'll keep Blu Ray and the Limited editions as the film really does look great in HD dispite this flaw.",1378339200,8,2816,4.599601593625498

7125012,5,B00W605FDO,"One of those timeless tales, and one of Disney's finest hours, `The Jungle Book' is one of the best examples of the Disney canon that is NOT centered on a princess.  There is nothing wrong with princesses in my book (I've got two of them) but there is something special about a family film that reaches both genders in a way that isn't centered on love interests and royalty.  Teaching valuable lessons with a humble setting is what `The Jungle Book' is all about, and this dazzling 1967 film is top notch, for sure.

The film tells that familiar tale of young Mowgli, a young boy raised by animals and segregated from civilization.  Threatened by the evil Shere Khan (a tiger), Mowgli's friends Baloo and Bagheera try and convince him to leave the jungle and join a nearby village.  Baloo, the boisterous and lovable bear, takes a stab at convincing the young boy to leave, but the fun they have makes the decision all the harder for the young boy, and Baloo.

The film is one great moment after the other, and is filled to the brim with memorable songs and sequences, characters and sentimental life lessons that make the enjoyment factor VERY high with this one.  In fact, as an adult one can really take in this film and appreciate it on another level.  The themes of friendship and loyalty are strong here, and the bond that forms between Mowgli and Baloo is something special, and something that all ages will feel connected to.

With splendid animation and songs that will remain with you year after year after year, `The Jungle Book' is a swinging good time to be had for the whole family.",1377561600,,1597,4.575438596491228

7125018,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book animated movie by Disney is a classic for all time and the perfect family movie.  Based on Rudyard Kiplings book of the same name published in 1894 and has been a favorite ever since.  Walt Disney adapted the story for the screen play and added some of the best songs ever written for film and utilized some of the greatest talent for narration, voice-overs, music, scripting, animation, and character design.  While Disney has put out many movies over the decades since Walt began his timeless journey, and many films became very popular in their day, The Jungle Book will stand as one of the all time greats along with Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Mary Poppins, 101 Dalmatians, Pinocchio, Sleeping Beauty, Peter Pan and Cinderella to name a few.

I,m writing this review for the benefit of all American fans of The Jungle Book,I understand it,s being released,on blu-ray,on February 2014 in America.
Well,it,s just been released,on blu-ray,here in Scotland,U.K.four days ago,I bought it today,so if anyone is interested in ""the blu-ray review"" here we go.
It,s been quite a while since I viewed it,on dvd,watching it on the blu-ray format was a PLEASURE,the picture quality is EXCELLENT,sharp as a tack,BEAUTIFUL!!!!the sound quality is TREMENDOUS,it,s like hearing it for the ""first time""!!!!!
I aint gonna review the Film itself,EVERYBODY knows the storyline,it,s a CLASSIC,in anybodys language,possibly Disney,s BEST!!!!
Now,something that is very unusual,the U.K. coming out with the blu-ray BEFORE America???? this is possibly a FIRST,reason being? not a clue!!!!
America has 6/7 months to wait for The Jungle Book blu-ray,trust me Guys,it,s well worth the wait,an absolutely MUST-BUY!!!!!!!!
I,ve read a few of the discussions about The Jungle Book being filmed at a 4.3 aspect,and a lot of guys saying that the widescreen version is cropped,on either I don't know which is correct,all I do know is this blu-ray widescreen version is SUPERB!!!!!!
Davy Cairns,Scotland.
ps,The Jungle Book blu-ray,U.K., is listed as Region B/C,absolutely no mention of Region Free,or Region A,if thats any help to someone who might be possibly thinking of buying the U.K. blu-ray,I repeat,no mention of Region Free,or A.",1376006400,,1467,5.524444444444445

7125048,5,B00W605FDO,"Disney stands for so many things and if you want to be cynical about them there is plenty of opportunity. For me I look to the things they've done the best and ""Jungle Book"" is one of the very best.

The characters are all well defined visually and the voices match the look perfectly. The songs are not just memorable they are almost necessary for a well rounded childhood.

No matter your age there will be someone here that you identify with. (I'd like it if I were Shere Khan, but I'm probably a little more King Louie) This is a fast paced, jazzy and fairly hip (for it's time) feature. It was one of the few that I never minded the kids saying, ""More! Again!""

The extras are fine, but I rarely judge a DVD release by the extras. In this case I was very happy with restored brilliance of color and sound. It looks just great on my Sony TV.

The kids I used to watch it with are now Sergeants in the army and computer techs for Microsoft, but I still watched it anyway. I remembered every word to every song and it all made me feel happy.

That is what Disney does best.",1372377600,,1075,4.173913043478261

My older brother took me to the theater to see it, must have been about 7 or 8 (I'm 51 now). The character that still stands out is the snake, with those hypnotizing eyes. He wasn't scary, but made me a little nervous when he turned those eyes on, and my brother noticed it. So he told a friend of his about it. He had what some call ""cat eyes"", ( a Black person with light colored eyes like blue, green, hazel etc). Well his friend was dark skinned with light grey eyes, and after he heard how I reacted to the snake in the cartoon, he would tease me by glaring at me with his big grey eyes. But it was all in fun, I wasn't ""traumatized"" or anything. Back then that's how older brothers and sisters played with and taunted one another. The orangutang is another favorite character - great movie for the kids overall.",1360368000,,907,4.218390804597701

The songs are wonderful and are up beat and our little one was off the couch in a shot to dance along with the music.  What I like about this as an adult is the story of how creatures band together to protect a child very different from themselves.  It doesnt matter where you live, look like or believe.  All that does matter is knowing the differences in us all should not stand in the way of protecting another being, in this case Mowgli, a little boy.
I cannot stand modern cartoons and I will not watch them. The Disney classics are enjoyable even over and over again.  As far as feedback for the seller, package arrived very prompt and even though the case was damaged the discs work fine.  Thank you.",1356912000,,872,4.1301775147929

7125136,4,B00W605FDO,"After falling completely off the wagon, as Walt Disney stepped down largely from the animated films at the end of the 1950's, this is, I would say, the greatest accomplishment of the lost Disney era (1960-1980). After Walt retired from this position, the individuals who came in his place were more concerned with saving money, recycling animation and doing everything cheap and quick (pshh, typical suits).

This was NOT the motto of Walt Disney, which is why under his wing the best animation the world has ever seen was produced. Unfortunately by the time this film came out W.D. had succumbed to lung cancer, so he was never able to see the final cut of the film. Although this was during the period of cheap animation, it's obvious when the animation is this scratchy and unclean, the story was good, the songs were great catchy jazzy tunes, voice acting was on par contributing to the overall saving of the movie. Now every Disney movie in the world has their own fan base, there are movies lots of people love and movies not as many people love, but every Disney film is loved for one reason or another.

The movies were also being much less produced then they had previously been, there were as many Disney films in the 1950's as there was from 1960 to the beginning of the new Disney Renaissance (1984-1994). Because of the quality of the films and reception after creating such great and seminal films as Cinderella how they could go to make hardly mediocre movies like The Aristocats?",1356393600,,1495,4.680608365019012

The music is wild, especially ""I Wanna Be Like You.""  I really like how this is a ""babysitter"" kind of movie where Bagheera the cranky panther must watch over a stubborn man cub like Mowgli, and Baloo doesn't seem to help him. The funniest moment between Baloo and Bagheera is when Bagheera gives a speech for Baloo who then takes it proudly, and makes Bagheera feel duped. Also, Shere Khan is a great villain, especially because he's a tiger. He's sophisticated, gentlemanly, but evil and deadly at the same time. Kaa is great too. He may not be the main villain or Shere Khan's henchman, but with all the popularity around him, he might as well be. Mowgli is remininscing of a protagonist with a difficult story; stubborn and rude but still a fun boy. King Louie's character is confusing for me. He kidnaps Mowgli, yet he is used for the fun bright side stuff of this movie? Oh well. Personally, I still really enjoy this.

7125164,4,B00W605FDO,"I like this movie, but I have just one burning question: are there really bears in the Indian jungle? It would seem they belong to colder climates. Oh, well, nobody asked for 100% authenticity. And how did the man cub learn to speak English? No more absurd than the rest of the animals in the jungle speaking English, I suppose.

Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) is an adorable young man, maybe 11 years old and rail thin, when the wolf pack that raised him from a baby ""man cub"" decides he has to be taken to the man village because Shere Khan the Tiger (George Sanders) is around, and he hates humans. He would surely destroy the man cub and anyone who tried to protect him. So Bagheera the Panther (Sebastian Cabot) volunteers to take him to the man village.

Mowgli doesn't want to go, he wants to stay in the jungle, even after Kaa the Snake (Sterling Holloway) hypnotizes him and the monkeys kidnap him. It turns out King Louie of the Apes (Louis Prima) wants Mowgli to teach him how to be a human. Specifically, he wants fire, but Mowgli doesn't know how to make fire, so that doesn't work out so well.

There is also a brigade of elephants led by Col Hathi, who will tell anyone at the drop of a branch about how he won the Victoria Cross. The colonial's adorable little son makes friends with Mowgli, which turns out to be important later on.

It's a fun story, but I won't swear it bears much resemblance to the original Jungle Book. Still, this is a good one to share with children and grandchildren.",1336608000,,1504,4.418772563176895

7125167,5,B00W605FDO,"I saw this movie when I was a kid.  I made my uncle, my mom and dad (separately, they were divorced) take me... We got the sound track and book... Soon I started writing my first stories...

'Cut scene' to today... my baby daughter Sofia... Loves this movie too!  She requests 'Mowgli and Balloo' and the other characters.  After going through it once I use the 'Scene choose' function so we can watch various scenes.  It's a great intro to feature length stories, with many scenes you can watch by themselves.  The music is wonderful - a true classic of the Disney Animation genre.  I've seen nothing of recent vintage that remotely compares.  I also use Fantasia.

As a teacher I recommend these movies - they are wonderful.  But as a Dad - what can be better than watching Baloo sing 'The Bear Necessities' - with your kid in your lap! Answer: Nothing!

It ends with a depiction of a traditional culture - no worries, my daughter will be a modern person.

Also - the voices are amazing.  The Classic actor George Sanders plays the evil Shere Kahn.. Sebastian Cabot as Bagheera.... and Sterling Holloway is Kaa - the same voice that plays Winnie the Pooh, but here he's the cunning python.  My daughter always requests his scene first.  And the scene with Louie Prima singing the part of King Louie is beyond price.

Have fun - and be confident that you're exposing your kid to quality stuff!",1334188800,,1394,4.560483870967742

THE JUNGLE BOOK was the last movie that Walt Disney directly oversaw. The finished picture in no way resembles Rudyard Kipling's original story, as Disney felt this was too dark for a cartoon. With top notch songs like ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" talented performers and animation that was part Xerox, part hand drawn, ""The Jungle Book"" is a fitting career closer from the greatest name in family motion picture entertainment, Walt Disney.

However, after having re-read Kipling's classic, I can not say that this film is true to the original story.  The characters, most notably Baloo, the elephant army, and Kaa, have lost their nobility, and have come off as buffoonish.  Then, too, there is no talk of ""the laws of the jungle,"" which was so important to the original story.  Finally, Mowgli's original conflict is diminished.  In the Kipling stories, Mowgli returns to the man-village because the wolf-pack, led by outsider Shere Khan, has turned on him.

7125191,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book is one hour and one hour and eighteen minutes and was released in theaters on October 18, 1967. This would be the last movie that Walt Disney personally oversaw. Basically the movie tells the story about a boy, Mowgli, who is raised by wolves in the jungles of Madhya Pradesh, India. It is ten years later and the tribe of wolves feels that the man cub must be sent to the human village because Shere Khan, a tiger, has return and they feel that they cannot protect the boy. Bagheera, a black leopard, offers to take the boy cub to the man village and that where the adventure begins. Mowgli does not want to live in the man village and wants to stay in the jungle.

Bagheera tries to explain to Mowgli, but he does not listen. Mowgli finds several different animals who would like to get closer to him for different reasons. Mowgli first meet Kaa, a giant Indian Python, and Kaa wants nothing more then to eat the child. Kaa fails in the two attempts when he is with the boy. Next he is met by Baloo, a sloth bear, and Baloo is a care free, fun loving bear who lives one day at a time. Baloo immediately takes a liking to Mowgli and wants to raise him a bear also. Later on in the movie Bagheera informs Baloo the truth as to why he can't raise him because of Shere Khan. While Mowgli and Baloo are enjoying life, Mowgli is kidnapped by a group of orangutans and is brought back to their leader - King Louie. King Louie wants the boy cub to teach on how to acquire the red flower (fire). King Louie plans are crushed when Baloo and Bagheera comes to rescue Mowgli. It is about ' into the movie that the main villain appears - Shere Khan. Shere Khan wants to kill the boy because he hates man and that includes women also. I will not go into how the story ends because of the criticism I have gotten in the past, but I will tell you that the movie had no ended and it was Walt Disney himself that came up with the ended himself.

The movie version of the Jungle Book differs greatly from the book version. In the book version there is no King Louie no vultures and the only resemblance to the book is the names used in the movie. Walt thought the book was too dark for children and instructed his animation department not to read the book. The Jungle Book was nominate for an Academy Award in 1967 for Best Song, The Bare Necessities, but lost out to Doctor Dolittle for Talk to the Animals. Gregory Peck tried to get the movie nominated and win for the Best Picture category, but the members of the Academy of Motion Pictures and Science felt that animation films did not belong in that category. It would not be until 1992 when Beauty and the Beast would be nominated for an Academy in the Best Picture category. The Jungle Book is a delightful movie for all ages and gets an AAAAA+++++.

7125195,5,B00W605FDO,"Reading other reviewers complaints about screen ratio it appears to me that no one appreciates the philosophy of ""bare necessities."" I guess I do though, because it doesnt bother me it wasn't released in widescreen, but still looks like an updated version of the VHS copy, which I had. So does Cinderella, play the same way, sooooo, so what. I'll say this one thing, Sleeping Beauty is presented in widescreen ratio, and I still use the ZOOM in my remote to bring the picture back to full screen. It seems I would rather be close to the characters, and the action, rather than appreciate the panoramic look. I think the portable dvd players, however, do manage to play with the panoramic look because of formatting. At any rate, these recent platinum Disney dvd issues are grand with multiple discs, extras, and places to choose besides movie. The package cover is 3D like and very attractive, almost difficult to throw away to keep just the discs on file, which I ususally do to most movies to downsize storage, but I have a special dvd rack for these wonderful Disney releases, and have no complaints about formats whatsoever.  There are books available on the art of Disney that present in printed form the final looks of most Disney animated films if one really needs to see the artwork firsthand.
Great extra of the animals that were left out, and how Walt hated the comedy bit profiled to one animal that was deleted by his account.",1298505600,,1438,4.683794466403162
7125196,5,B00W605FDO,"I have fond memories of this film from my childhood and was delighted to receive a copy for Christmas. It's just how I remember it, beautifully animated, toe tapping music, great characterisations (although this was less of a concern when I was 5!) and a good story to boot. Modern animations, although impressive, seem too polished sometimes and I love in this film how you can see the pen strokes on the screen and get a feel that there was a person behind the artwork. The songs in this film are some of Disney's most famous and rightly so, 'Bare Necessities' 'King of the Swingers', even the 'elephant parade', they really are that good . I tend to find Disney films too saccharine sweet, but The Jungle Book is just the right balance of cuteness and story. Overall a great film from the Disney back catalogue and one not to be missed.

7125212,4,B00W605FDO,"Jungle Book, the movie, is radically different from the classic Rudyard Kipling novel but I tend to be more forgiving if a movie preserves the spirit of the book but in this case it absolutely doesn't. The characters are completely different and remain the same only in name and species. In particular the literary Baloo is nothing like the singing slacker from the movie. One might note that at the beginning it states that the movie was `inspired' by Kipling's Jungle Book and I assume by this it means that Disney was inspired to write a completely new story. The real question is whether or not the Jungle Book, standing on its own, is a quality animated movie. Of course it is, it's Disney but that doesn't mean it's spectacular. The Jungle Book is a rather small tale that takes place over the course of one or two days as Mowgli is taken by Bagheera and Baloo to live in the man village.

There are a few issues with the movie that can be a bit cringe worthy. The monkeys who kidnap Mowgli, including King Louis, are all portrayed as stereotypical blacks. Now one might argue that the movie does take place in Africa except it doesn't. The Jungle Book takes place in India which is in Asia. Why aren't the monkeys portrayed as stereotypical Indians? There is a tremendous amount of Disneyfication. In the book Mowgli grows to loath the humans for their treatment of his parents and uses elephants to raze the village to the ground. This is, shall we say, NOT the ending Disney went with. In the book Mowgli kills Shere Khan and skins him rather than having him scamper off with his tail on fire.

The animation is old fashioned yeoman type work but in this case that is a big compliment. There is no corner cutting here as each characters is drawn alive and active rather than static with moving mouths as cheaper animation studios will do. The character movement is very believable and I'm sure a ton of rotoscoping was done which I don't consider cheating in the least. Disney was well known for doing meticulous research on animal movement and Shere Kahn looks great as he stalks Mowgli. The music is very catchy including the python Kaa's `Trust in Me' and Baloo's wonderful `Bear Necessities'. Overall the animation is probably average or below average for a Disney movie (which are always above average for animation in general). It's very dark and often bland.

So what you get is a dramatically watered down story that kinds of leaves it a bit dull. It's just a one (or perhaps two) day journey to the man village and not a whole heckuva lot happens. There are segments where Mowgli meets a group of elephants and another with some buzzards imitating the Beatles (a rather unfortunate attempt to tap into some pop culture circa 1967). Both of these segments added nothing to the larger story which is paper thin. I like the concept behind The Jungle Book and there are great elements but if I were to start a collection of Disney movies The Jungle Book would be low on my list of movies to own.",1278892800,2,3009,4.568518518518519

The movie was enjoyable to watch.  The segments on the making of the film reveal why it was so successful, why I enjoyed it so much when I was a kid.

There is only one complaint I have, and that regards the packaging.  You realize early on that the primary storyteller, a key character, was Bagheera the panther, and he has been my favorite Disney character.  Yet he is not at all on the packaging of the film, either on the front or on the back.

7125244,4,B00W605FDO,"If there is some kind of contest on for the Walt Disney movie which least resembles the supposed source material, ""The Jungle Book"" must be the clear winner. It bears only the lightest and most coincidental resemblance to Rudyard Kiplings's cycle of stories about a little boy raised by wolves in the Indian jungle. Only the setting and the names of characters are preserved. That said, ""The Jungle Book"" deserves to be considered on its' own terms as a classically animated Disney feature,  the very last to have been blessed by the hand of Walt himself. The plot is as thin as a wisp; the journey of the boy Mowgli to the village of his own kind, interspersed with some good-natured musical numbers, and helped or hindered by a variety of genial animals, and not terribly threatening villains.

It is a curious jumble, to watch with eyes accustomed to more recent animated features like ""Shrek"" and ""Toy Story"". Without exception the backgrounds are beautifully rendered, densely detailed, almost painterly. The animal characters were fully-fleshed, and with the exception of Kaaa, the python, seemed to move and flex like their real counterparts; especially King Louie the baboon, Bagheera the panther and Sher Khan the tiger. The last two seemed especially slinky; it would be nice to know if the artists responsible for their rendering had cats. King Louie is hilarious, and so are the four vultures - very obviously patterned after the Beatles.  In contrast, the rendering of Mowgli the boy and ostensible hero, looks like a bland and sketchily rendered cut-out. It almost seems as if the artists were far more interested in the animals.

The extra features included are generous; this is veritably the platinum standard for a DVD classic. It is on  two discs; necessary to contain the complete movie and commentary. There is also a nearly hour-long feature about how the movie was developed, along with several shorter features. One of the bonus features is a look at a character ""Rocky the Rhino"" who was eventually omitted - rather a pity actually, since Rocky  would have been voiced by the man who did ""Crazy Guggenheim"". There are also complete recordings of songs which were dropped from the final version, and probably a good call. There are also generous picture galleries of the characters and of the background art, which was purely my favorite, and a series of games. The actual movie itself takes barely more than an hour itself, but the extras will keep an audience amused for days.",1243900800,2,2502,4.9170616113744074

Disney twisted the story to make Mowgli naive and helpless.  The only moment in the movie that (almost) rings true is Mowgli's attraction to the human girl at the end -- but in the novel, this only happens when Mowgli becomes a man.  In the book Mowgli is driven back to man by traitorous members of the wolf pack, but returns to the jungle after killing Shere Khan and being rejected by his fellow humans.

This was the last feature personally supervised by Walt Disney and it kind of shows his older sensibilities. It felt a little 'phoned in'.

I will always have fond memories of this movie, but I may not watch it too frequently so I don't dilute those memories.

Some of the catchiest tunes ever, and way ahead-of-its-time animation. Everyone in the family will love this Kipling and Disney classic.",1208304000,,391,4.52112676056338

7125265,4,B00W605FDO,"Well, yes, that's true.  This is one of the great classics ever produced.  I already own the original version in full frame on DVD.  The reason that I gave this 4 stars is simply because they cropped the movie from top and bottom to make it widescreen.  It's not true that you won't see the characters heads.  Yes, you lose a little from the picture, but then so you do if you play the full frame version on a widescreen TV and you set the TV to ""widezoom"" instead of 16:9, because if you set the TV to 16:9 you will see everything ""flat"".  So you need to set it to a more normal aspect ratio, which in the Sony case it's called ""widezoom"", Philips has the ""Zoom 16:9"" and ""Zoom 14:9"", others have other names for that setting.  When you watch the movie like that, in order to fill the entire screen, you will lose from top and bottom on a full frame movie.
However, with this movie, they didn't simply just cut the movie from top and bottom.  They did an entire re-working of the film, where they take it frame by frame and they cut from top and bottom where there's unimportant stuff on the screen.  In other words, if you have a scene where the character is shown more on the top of the screen, and you have a rock or grass, or something else on the bottom, then they will cut only from the bottom enough so that it fits on a widescreen frame.  In other scenes, they will cut accordingly, so that you won't lose essential stuff that must be seen.
Therefore, if you're trying to make a decision whether or not you should replace your original, full-frame DVD of this movie with this new widescreen version, I guess it all comes down to how much of a movie buff you are.  If you really really love a classic, an original, then you will stick to the original full frame if you already have it.  If you just want to own a copy of this movie, and you own a widescreen TV and you adore new technology, then I suggest that you buy this new version.  They made it to fit just that profile.
Me - I already own the original full-frame DVD.  I've watched it on my widescreen TV and it looks fine.

When I finally got the DVD for Christmas and watched it, I loved every minute of it. Jungle Book has lost none of its charm over the past 40 years. From the very beginning, when we see Bagheera rescuing the abandoned ""man-cub,"" Mowgli and entrusting him to the wolf pack, to Mowgli's journey through the jungle to the man village, it's a pure delight. Shere Khan, who hates man, has returned to the jungle to find young  Mowgli and kill him. The wolf pack hears about this and decides it's too dangerous to keep him around any longer, and have Bagheera escort him to the man village to safety. Of course, Mowgli does not want to leave the jungle, and tries to get away from Bagheera. He meets Baloo the bear, Kaa the python, and the scat-singing King Louie (voiced by the legendary Louie Prima). This can more than hold its own against modern classics such as ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin,"" and ""Lion King."" Highly recommended for kids of all ages!",1199577600,,1053,4.427835051546392

I didn't really remember much about this movie, apart from the songs. But as soon as it started, it all came flooding back. It was never my favourite Disney movie, and it was also Walt Disney's last movie, before he died. There are also a few problems with this movie - a couple of scenes are directly lifted from previous films (the scene where Mowgli is met by his 'family' is the same as the scene from Sword In The Stone), Phil Harris who did the voice of Baloo went on to voice the Little John character in Robin Hood, and the snake is the same in this film as in Robin Hood again. It feels almost lazy at some points, but they're using the same artists, so it does feel quite familiar at some points.

Why was Jungle Book never my favourite Disney movie? I'm not quite sure about that one, it just never appealed to me as much as some of the others. I never really enjoyed the book either.

I got the UK edition of the DVD, which comes with the 2 disc DVD, and also a book. It's just a plain picture book, with key scenes from the movie, which is quite a cute addition.

Disney are doing well with these reissues of old movies, even if the extras are always aimed at the kids - what about adults reliving their childhood? - but they're not coming out fast enough!

I was so distracted by all the cropped heads and feet there was no way I could concentrate on the plot. So much of the background and scenery was lost that it just threw the scenes off balance. Why even call this a platinum edition when the original 1.37.1 aspect ration was not preserved? Isn't that what a platinum edition is all about? Ever see a cropped Picasso or Van Gogh?

Along the way they meet up with the one and only jungle VIP, King Louie (wonderfully voiced by Louis Prima), Kaa the python (Sterling Holloway), everybody's favorite bear, Baloo (Phil Harris) and some wisecracking vultures.

This platinum edition features an excellent digital restoration, a number of excellent documentaries, games, a visit with ""Rocky the Rhino,"" who found his way to the cutting room floor, and plenty of other extras.  There's also a passable Jonas Brothers cover of Louis Prima's ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" that's sure to attract the attention of pre-teen girls the world over.

This particular DVD is also a Disney Movie Rewards disc, meaning that you can gain points for purchasing it.

While some squabble over the aspect ratio of the film, I think that the story, music, and characters are far too valuable to pass up because of this.  If you don't own ""The Jungle Book"" and consider yourself a Disney fan, make sure you buy this disc before Disney takes it away again.

Three stars says you like the movie, but at the same time your not in love with it. That explains my position perfectly. This is a charming movie that I thoroughly enjoyed as a child, and by all means it is superior to most films that are made for children today. My main issue is that I don't feel it is as strong as other classic movies from the Disney vault. It just doesn't compare to a Snow White, Peter Pan, Bambi, Lady And The Tramp, or Mary Poppins. It is good to note that this is a solid childrens film that the whole family can enjoy. However, I always hold Disney films under a more critical lense. Disney themselves set the standard for childrens films, so they should be judged by the standards they set forth. Jungle Book is a solid movie I am proud to own.

7125336,5,B00W605FDO,"Left in the jungle as a baby, raised by wolves, befriended by a panther and a bear, Mowgli's life is now threatened by the return of Shere Khan, the tiger, and king of the jungle. Don't worry; this movie has very little violence for it is a classic story based off of Rudyard Kipling's story about a boy who is raised by wolves.
  Mowgli's animal family refers to him as the ""man cub"" and he is happy living in the jungles of India, but once the tiger Shere Khan finds out he is there, he will no longer be safe. Bagheera, the wise old panther, decides to take Mowgli to the nearest man village, even though the boy doesn't want to leave. Throughout their journey, they encounter Kaa, a hypnotic snake, and an army of elephants, and Baloo the bear, who is widely popular for his ""Bare Necessities"" song. Mowgli is tempted by Baloo's lovable, laid-back way of life, but when Mowgli decides he likes being a bear and the two ditch Bagheera, the pair run into trouble.
Some crazy orangutans kidnap Mowgli and take him to their king, Louis Prima, who then tempts him with an offer he can't refuse. Shere Khan finds out there is a ""man cub"" in his jungle and is hot on his trail. Somehow, Baloo and Bagheera find a way to team up to protect the boy.
  Once the unlikely duo rescue Mowgli from the orangutans, Baloo angers him by mentioning they must take him to a man village and he runs off. He eventually encounters the barbershop singer group made up of vultures and they cheer him up. Danger strikes when Shere Khan appears and attempts to capture Mowgli. Baloo comes to his rescue by distracting the tiger so he can get away, but the tiger attacks Baloo and knocks him unconscious. Bagheera then ties a branch engulfed with fire to the tigers tail and he runs off.
  Once Shere Khan is defeated in the film and Baloo recovers, the trio treks on and only by chance does Mowgli leave the jungle. At the bittersweet ending, Mowgli is lured by his human instincts when he sees a girl for the first time and follows her into the village.
The Jungle Book is filled with songs you can't help but sing along to and with jungle animals you can't help but fall in love with, even Shere Khan's voice is charming. Enjoyed by children and adults alike, this charming film is Disney's 17th animated feature and the last film Walt supervised before his death.
  I enjoy this movie every time I watch it, especially now because it reminds me how much I loved it when I was a kid. Every character is appealing to viewers in some way because they are all so diverse and in it's own way, the film does teach children even though it wasn't necessarily created for educational purposes. Children can learn that even if someone may look or act differently from them, they can still get along. By the end of the movie, Bagheera manages to loosen up enough to give in to Baloo's care-free way of life. They can also learn about teamwork through Baloo and Bagheera and that it's not okay to kill someone even if you don't like them.
  I would certainly recommend this film to children, parents and even teachers. Teachers may find the new edition very useful for educational purposes because it is interactive. Parents and children may also find the interactive aspect a plus because kids can then interact with their favorite characters through games. The 40th Anniversary Platinum Edition just came out this fall, with many special features such as music videos, deleted scenes and songs, long lost characters, backstage features, games, and more.",1194739200,,3524,4.561708860759493

I'll watch this over and over again it's so good.",1194652800,,377,4.920634920634921
7125340,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book is a significant film for several reasons. First, it was the last film that Walt Disney himself was involved in directly. Walt had not been happy with some of the company's recent efforts such as ""Sword in the Stone"" and he took a more hands-on role with Jungle Book. Unfortunately, Disney would not see the fruits of his efforts. He passed away in December 1966, about seven months before the film was released. Still, Disney's handprints are all over the film. Initially conceived as a darker, more dramatic film, and more influenced by Rudyard Kipling's original story, Disney tossed out the idea, along with the original director. The result was the last great Disney animated film before the company was rejuvenated in the 1990's with films like ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". By anyone's account, their films of the 70's and 80's were lacking the passion of earlier efforts.

Yet another significant difference in this movie was the use of major Hollywood talent to supply the voices for most of the characters. This is common practice today but was not the norm in the 1960's. And you probably could not have selected a more eclectic group of actors. At one of the spectrum you have stately British actors Sebastion Cabot as Bagheera the Panther and George Sanders (one of Hollywood's great voices) as the sinister tiger Shere Khan. At the polar opposite was Comedian/actor /bandleader Phil Harris and his southern drawl playing happy-go-lucky bear Baloo, along with Jazz bandleader and swing singer Louis Prima as the voice of orangutan King Louis. Additional voices were provided by Sterling Holloway as Kaa the snake. Holloway is better known for providing the voice of another Disney character, Winnie the Pooh. Ron Howard's brother, Clint, voiced baby elephant Junior. One other footnote, the singing voice of Shere Khan was performed by Thurl Ravenscroft who was the voice of Tony the Tiger, as well as the singer of the ""Grinch"" song.

The story oh Jungle Book is simple. Little boy Mowgli was found in the jungle and raised by wolves. But when the wolves find out that the evil Shere Khan is returning to the jungle, they enlist the aid of Bagheera and Baloo to escort Mowgli back to the man village. The only problem is that Mowgli doesn't want to go. He's grown up in the jungle and the animals are his friends and only family. Complicating masters is not one, but three villains. Besides Shere Khan, Kaa and King Louie all want Mowgli for their own reasons. Bagheera and Baloo have to keep him safe from the villains and convince him that the man village is the best place for him.

Jungle book contains two of the best songs in Disney history, ""The Bare Necessities"" and the swinging `I Wanna be Like You"". These are timeless songs which were both Oscar-nominated. Not to be forgotten is the menacing and hypnotic ""Trust in Me"" sung by Kaa to Mowgli as he prepares to make a meal of him. It's a fantastic production and the animation is simply gorgeous. Watch the scene when Mowgli is walking by himself through the jungle, kicking at the ground. The fluidity of movement is perfect, and watch how his hair blows in the gentle breeze. 3D animation may be the rage today but there's nothing like outstanding 2D animation.

This is the latest Disney classic to get the platinum treatment and while it doesn't have as many special features as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it's still a solid lineup of extras. The making of documentary runs about 45 minutes and includes current and vintage interviews with many of the writers, animators, actors, and the composers who were involved in the project. This takes you through the complete process and there's great footage of Prima and his band dancing about as they perform ""I Wanna Be Like you"". In ""Mowgli's Return to the Jungle"", Bruce Reitherman, the voice of Mowgli, shares his memories of making the film and how the experiences influenced his current job as a wildlife filmmaker. Reitherman's father, Wolfgang, was the film's director.

There's an interesting short featurette on a lost character from the film. The near-sighted, short-tempered rhinoceros named Rocky is brought to the screen using original storyboards and original voice recordings by Frank Fontaine. In addition there's a couple of other featurettes, audio commentary, sill gallery, music videos, and games. The word classic is over used today but it definitely applies to The Jungle Book. Forty years later this is still a wonderful film for the whole family.

Did I ever see this movie when I was young?  It is so hard to know with these Disney movies as I watch them with my daughter.  Some of the songs seem familiar, but is it from watching the movie?  We only got to see them every couple years or so on the Sunday night movie.

This movie, which was released the same year I was born, is much more fresh and young than I am.  First- another Disney remastering where the film is absolutely flawless, crisp, and colorful.  The soundtrack is good as well.

As for the film and story and music, this is one of the best from Disney.  Watching Baloo dance and sing the Bare Necessities is so enjoyable for adults and kids.  When Baloo puts on his ""disguise"" at the ruins and starts to dance with King Louie, he steals the show.

All the songs are great, but my favorite is King Louie's ""I Wanna Be Like You"".  If there is one flaw with the whole DVD, it is the music video for that song by a youngish rock band, and it is a bad version.  Louis Prima's original is so good, perhaps nobody could top it, but this isn't even close.  Disney has done much better with some of the extra music videos on the other DVDs.

One special touch of all these Disney movies, is compeletely unintentional, is ""spotting"" or hearing the voice actors in the various roles in the various movies.  In this one, of course you have Sebastian Cabot, but the one I really love is Sterling Holloway as Kaa the boa.  Holloway a decade later would go on to be Winnie the Pooh and you can always hear him as Pooh, so to hear Pooh's voice come out of the evil Kaa, is just delightful.  (Holloway also was the stork in Dumbo 25 years earlier than Jungle Book).

Superbly voiced by Phil Harris, Baloo seems to be endowed with all the characteristics that made Walt Disney himself so beloved: he's charming, funny, warm, inventive, child-like and a helluva lot of fun to be around.  How poignant that he was pretty much the master animator's final creation.  The ""ridiculous"" being four mop-topped Liverpudlian vultures.  This embarrasingly misguided homage to the Beatles -- who sing a hackneyed barbershop quartet yet -- lowers ""The Jungle Book"" to a level it never rises above.  Too bad, as the film up until then has been a near-classic.  The animation is gorgeously detailed and colorful, the scoring by George Bruns mysterious and evocative and the songs clever and memorable.  I say ""near""-classic, as I find the elephants both boring and unneccesary, particularly when they set out to find the missing Mowgli and trudge themselves right out of the film, never to be seen again!

7125356,4,B00W605FDO,"Once again, Disney delivers; not only a ""Classic"" animated film, but loads it with extras for everyone to enjoy.  This film was a hit when I was a youngster and is one of my three favorite Disney animated movies.  [The others being- 101 Dalmations and Snow White].  All the voices fit the characters they are portraying.  Not like the animated flicks of today, with celebrities hitching to the voice wagon, just so they can tell their precocious offspring- ""Look daddy (or in some cases Grandpappy) is the voice of Fester the Fish!"" I especially like the voice of Shere Khan, provided by George Sanders.  Those great animators of yesteryear even made the Tiger look like Sanders.  Each frame of the film is picture postcard perfect.  I could go on and on, but suffice it to say-I loved this DVD!  Now I'm waiting with bated breath for the spring release of 101 Dalmations.  I know the Disney group will not disappoint.  [PS: Now if only I could plant a seed about releasing- The Scarecrow Of Romney Marsh].",1193961600,,1006,4.6647727272727275

So many years later it's just as good as yesterday, in fact better now with the new remastering. I watched it for the first time on VHS as a kid, and it's wonderful to see how good the movie looks on DVD.

My daughter saw it for the first time and adored the movie and I was captured by Baloo the bear's antics once again. This time round I noticed so many things that I had not noticed as a kid... especially the diverse accents of all the characters - the vultures have British accents, Kaa the python has an Indian accent, King Louie the monkey sings beautiful soul. These are the little touches of genius that make the movie what it is...there is something just so good and endearing about this movie. It not only brings you closer to nature but also teaches some valuable lessons about life along the way. The songs in the movie are some of the best of any Disney movie with catchy tunes that will have you tapping your feet and singing along every time you watch this movie with the kids.",1193875200,,1102,4.298076923076923

7125367,4,B00W605FDO,"Beautifully restored Disney classic.  The last great animated film of Disney's old school animators. When animation took the turn to more CGI I grimmaced.  Illustrated in a loose style with a sketchy feel, the animators infused far more life than a sterile computer graphic modelling.  These artists could really draw.
With incredible voice talent of New Orleans' Phil Harris and Louie Prima, this movie is so jazzy and cool that you become addicted to their style of lingo and banter. Just like being in New Orleans French Quarter!
This two disk set is curiously missing the theatrical trailer(s) while they managed to put in an extraneous music video.  Who really cares about these young kids singing a Jungle Book updated (gasp) song.  I don't.  So as a collector I felt somewhat slighted when the theatrical trailer and any promotional material was absent.  I guess Disney will go to the old cash cow once again for a SUPER DUPER PLATINUM GOLD EDITION and include all promotional materials then.  How shrewd!

7125386,5,B00W605FDO,"""The Jungle Book"" needs no praise from me; it's a lot of fun, and about as ""hip"" as Disney got (at least without being embarrassing about it) until Pixar started figuring into the occasion.

But I'd like to say a few words about the extras. On paper, they look pretty skimpy -- especially for a two-disc release -- but in truth, they're pretty good. There's a full-length commentary (though unfortunately many of the principals aren't around to pitch in), and an hour or so of documentaries, and that's not even getting into the games and such, which I have no interest in investigating.

My only reservation about the extra material is that it could be a bit better edited -- several of the same anecdotes pop up as many as three times. But I found it interesting to hear (and see), for instance, how Louis Prima and his band performed ""I Wanna Be Like You"" to inspire the Disney artists (though the band was eventually replaced on the soundtrack), and hear the complete earlier score supplied by Terry Gilkyson, which -- other than ""The Bare Necessities"" -- was dropped along with the original conception of the film.",1192320000,5,1119,4.675126903553299
7125387,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book tells the story of a boy named Mowgli who is raised by wolves in an Indian jungle.  He leads an idyllic life befriended by many animals until the day that Shere Khan, the tiger, returns to the area intent on killing the boy.  The animals decide to send Mowgli to the man-village where his people can protect him.  Bagheera the panther gets the job of escorting him, but Mowgli has no desire to leave the jungle.  In his desperation. Mowgli links up with Baloo the Bear and attempts learn the ""Bear Necessities.""  A good deal more happens, but I don't want to give away the whole plot.

Disney has made few movies that have maintained their popularity as well as The Jungle Book.  It is a true classic.  First, the voice talent is quite possibly the finest ever assembled for an animated film.  Younger audiences will not be familiar with names like George Sanders and Sebastian Cabot even though they were very well known in their day.  But the important thing is that every single voice is pitch perfect for the part.  The epitome of this is obviously Phil Harris who provided the booming voice of Baloo.  I must confess that Baloo is probably my favorite Disney character of all time and I can't conceive of anyone else bringing the easy charm and warmth that Harris just radiated with that incredible voice of his.

The characters are all interesting and likable.  The malicious Shere Khan comes across as incredibly suave with a wry wit that is quite funny at times.  Even relatively minor characters like Colonel Hathi and King Louie are memorable and enjoyable.  This is partly because of the excellent voice acting and partly because of the unusually sharp script.  The story moves along at a brisk pace and more than holds the interest of adults and children alike.  Mowgli seems to get in one mess after another and the jungle provides a great source of these situations.

The music is yet another high point.  The soundtrack features several tunes that are very catchy and fun.  Some are well remembered such as ""The Bare Necessities"" and ""I Wanna Be Like You.""  But even less featured songs such as ""Colonel Hathi's March"" and ""That's What Friends Are For"" burn themselves quite pleasantly into your brain.

If The Jungle Book has a fault, it is in the animation.  The movie was made just as Disney started cutting major corners in their animation and it shows.  The character animations are definitely more sketchy and rough than you would see in a movie like Lady and the Tramp when they were more meticulous.  Fortunately, the character design was still flawless and the quality of art had not yet diminished to the extent that it would in the 1970s when the company's animation hit rock bottom.

My final verdict on The Jungle Book is that it is as entertaining an animated film as you're ever likely to see.  In many aspects of its production, it remains one of the true greats and I would recommend it to anyone of any age.  The story is interesting, the characters and voices are incredible, and the music is as catchy as any soundtrack you'll hear.  The art is a little rough but is not nearly bad enough to detract from the overall experience.",1192320000,3,3179,4.635062611806798
7125388,5,B00W605FDO,"What can I say...it's a Disney Classic. It's great the Disney finally chose to put it on DVD, it's a nice addition to our collection.",1192060800,,133,4.36
7125389,4,B00W605FDO,"I hate the word ""zany"" though since it implies to me a sense of craziness with no heart or anything of substance. But when you look at it, The Jungle Book was probably one of Disney's more optimistic and overly-joyful outings; from its music to its humor to its voice acting. But it also had, like a lot of Disney films had, a sense of something beyond surface-level that you could get out of it. While certain things about it feel unpolished, it's a good capper on Walt Disney's influential career and a good film on its own.

One day in the jungle, Bagheera the panther finds a small baby in the woods. Not having the heart to abandon it, he decides to leave it with a small wolf pack. Now 10, Mowgli wants to stay in the jungle and be like everyone else but when the feared Shere Khan the tiger is spotted with a loathesome opinion of man, Bagheera has to help Mowgli get to a man-village. But when free-spirited bear Baloo comes in befriending Mowgli and seductive snake Kaa wanting Mowgli for lunch, it becomes harder to get him safely to the village.

Probably best known as Disney's last film before he died in 1966, the Jungle Book is one of those kind of films where others have done better in certain areas yet the film pulls it off anyway. For one thing, the animation is not as impressive as Sleeping Beauty was, the villain doesn't have the presence and staying power like Captain Hook or Cruella Da Vil. And after many a viewings, I still never found the elephant herd likable or even entertaining on some way. As for the rest of the film, what it does have is fun music from the ever-popular ""Bare Necessities"" to the infectious ""I Wanna Be Like You"".

Make all the jokes you want about DI$NEY and their tendency to favor money and product over art, they're second to none when it comes down to getting the film look pristine and while the animation style looks a bit cruder (which started around 101 Dalmations and continued till the 80's), this is probably the best looking version of the film out there. We also get a making-of and a commentary but then again it's got that Disney tendency of putting in kid's games so it might not be stockful of meaningful info but at least you can say it's stocked.

Parts of me enjoy the Jungle Book but another half of me finds it the least likely candidate of the Platinum releases to get constant replaying but it's a fun movie anyway that kids will no doubt love.

By the way, for those interested, next is 101 Dalmations for Spring and apparently, Sleeping Beauty is being re-released this time next year for Blu-Ray.",1191974400,3,2577,4.451271186440678
7125390,5,B00W605FDO,"A majestic black panther named Bagheera comes across a human baby all alone in an Indian jungle. Concerned for the child's wellbeing, he delivers it to a family of wolves in the hopes that they will take him in as one of their own. They do, and the boy, Mowgli, grows up happily among the animals as a creature of the jungle. But when the ferocious, man-hating tiger Shere Khan returns to the area on a mission to kill the boy, Mowgli's animal friends must conspire to return him to the safety of the man-village from whence he came.

Bagheera and Mowgli set forth on the long journey to the village and encounter some of Disney's greatest characters along the way. The best one being, without a doubt, Baloo the bear, who immediately adopts Mowgli after the boy discovers the purpose of his excursion with Bagheera and refuses to continue. Mowgli is happy where he is, and Baloo is all set to teach his new man-cub how to be a bear and live off the bare necessities. However, with such dangers as Kaa the hypnotic python, King Louie the would-be pyromaniac orangutan and his monkey troupe, and of course the menacing, deadly Shere Khan lurking about in search of the boy, even the carefree Baloo will have to take into consideration what is best for the child.

Truly one of the finest Disney animated features of all-time, and possibly my favorite from Walt's day (though, that's a very tough call), ""The Jungle Book"" is a must have for anyone who loves Disney animation or just animation in general! This is still considered some of the finest character animation of all-time! And that's what ""The Jungle Book"" is all about, the characters! The plot is simple, no doubt about that. It's a road-trip through the jungle with survival being the key concern. There's more emotion and entertainment to it than you might think though, thanks to those outstanding character creations! This film has plenty of laughs and heart, and some of the best music you've ever heard (thanks to the Sherman Brothers, Terry Gilkyson, and George Bruns)! Wonderfully directed by Disney animation legend Wolfgang Reitherman, whose son Bruce was the voice of Mowgli, and guided by the master himself, Walt Disney, as the last animated feature he would personally oversee, ""The Jungle Book"" was deservedly an instant smash success! The virtually ""living"" animation and simple storytelling demonstrate Disney filmmaking at its best, and one of the songs (Bare Necessities) even earned an Academy Award Nomination! And for those who think casting big-name celebs in animated films detracts from the overall effect, it certainly didn't hurt this Disney Masterpiece! The cast roster includes such folks as Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, George Sanders, and even Clint Howard, among others! It was even intended to use the Beatles as the voices of the vultures, but I guess they felt they were bigger than Jungle Book. Oh well, I always preferred The Monkees myself! Though, this film features a different kind of monkey.

Without a doubt, if you own a DVD player, you should own this DVD, and ""The Jungle Book"" has never looked better! This newly restored version, presented here in a widescreen format that gives us less on the top and bottom (but more on the sides) than the old, bare-bones release, looks and sounds great and is loaded with extras spread out over 2-discs. Before I get to the extras though, I know everyone is concerned about the aspect ratio thing. Well, there seems to be debate over whether Disney should have gone the matted route. Some say the film was intended to be cropped into a widescreen version for its theatrical release, some argue that it was not. Clearly, Disney should have included both options in this set, but my best advice is to not throw your Limited Issue ""Jungle Book"" DVD out if this is a problem for you. I probably will hang on to mine. Of course, most of you probably don't have the L.I. DVD, but whether you do or not, don't hesitate to pick up this newer edition. The picture, matted as it is, looks amazing, and the extras are so great. Sure, there could have been more. Disney has somewhat slacked off on the Platinum Editions most of the time in comparison to the initial Snow White release, but there is still a lot of must have stuff for the Jungle Book fan!

In addition to the film itself, Disc One holds a wonderful audio commentary with Bruce Reitherman (Mowgli's voice and son of the film's director), composer Richard Sherman, and current Disney master animator and self-professed number one Jungle Book fan Andreas Deja. Archival recordings of animators who worked on the film are also played during the commentary, and it all adds up to one very informative and enjoyable, even touching experience. The first disc also includes the ""Music and More"" section, which holds your standard, cheezy Disney Channel teen update video, this one being the Jonas Brothers performing ""I Wanna Be Like You,"" and a set of three sing-along song selections from the film, as well as two other far more fascinating features. These are a group of audio selections of deleted songs from a very different version of the film that Walt felt was too dark for a Disney animated feature, and a deleted character/scene of a dim-witted rhino named Rocky put together in voiced storyboard format. The deleted scene is quite interesting to watch, especially with its more Beatle-esque version of ""That's What Friends Are For,"" but overall it's not something that you'll regret having been cut. The deleted songs, on the other hand, are a bit more substantial and bring to mind the much earlier, live-action ""Jungle Book"" film starring Sabu. Besides all that great stuff, there is a promo for the Disney Wildlife Worldwide Conservation Fund, and the disc is also enhanced with Disney Fast Play for the kiddies.

Disc Two features the bulk of the extras, of course, the main one being the expected ""Making-Of"" featurette, ""The Bare Necessities: The Making of The Jungle Book."" This is an excellent 46 and half (or so) minute featurette full of great interviews and with a really tear-jerking section that goes into Walt's death during the making of the film. It really is a captivating watch, and it can be viewed in sections if one chooses. Other featurettes include a first-rate comparison between Disney's version of the film and the original works of Rudyard Kipling, ""The Lure of the Jungle Book,"" in which we get to see modern animators reminisce about what ""The Jungle Book"" has meant to them and their careers, ""Mowgli's Return to the Wild,"" a featurette about Bruce Reitherman's current life as a nature filmmaker and his reflections on his father, and finally ""Frank and Ollie,"" which is not the feature-length documentary of the same title available on its own DVD, but rather a brief carry over from the Jungle Book laserdisc previously referred to as ""Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston Discuss Character Animation."" Besides the featurettes, there is one more group of extras that falls under the heading of ""The Man Village"" (as Disc Two is divided into two sections), and that is the Art Galleries. These are what you have come to expect from Disney Platinum releases and are all very appreciated by us Disney animation fanatics, of course. The other section of Disc Two falls under the heading of ""Jungle Fun,"" and, to be honest, it's mostly just for the kids, though I do like the Disneypedias. The bulk of the section is 4 games that can be played as one long game, but I had trouble playing them on my player (which probably has more to do with the player than the disc) and I wasn't too interested anyway. I'd rather have trivia games if anything. There's also some sort of English teaching game that is separate from those others. Now, that was in interesting inclusion. I think it could work to teach any kids the names of animals though. As I said, there is a Disneypedia in this section, which is sort of like a Disney-fied Animal Planet program (running just under 15 minutes). Here, we get to see and learn about the real animals and locations from the film, and while it's aimed at kids too, it can also be enjoyed by adults.

While the DVD extras do lack any theatrical trailers for the feature itself and movie poster art in the gallery section, this still adds up to a fantastic, must-own DVD, as are all the Disney Platinum Edition releases. I suppose that's the real reason why Disney hasn't been putting as much into them as they could lately. Even with less content than the earlier Platinums, they still are amazing sets, especially compared to the original, bare bones releases. ""The Jungle Book"" was released in 1967, by the way, almost a full year after Walt's death. It is inarguably one of his greatest achievements. In 2003, Disney released an all new sequel to theaters, ""The Jungle Book 2."" Despite what most hardcore Disney fans would say, I feel there was great potential in a sequel to the '67 classic. We still hadn't seen what life was like for Mowgli in the Man-Village, and here was the opportunity. Unfortunately, as with most of the sequels to Disney classics, the film was made strictly with a child audience in mind, and it didn't meet its full potential. Also, some great characters weren't included and colors were just plain wrong. It was a theatrical release that looked more like a better-than-average direct-to-video release. While it's not without a certain level of entertainment value, most adult viewers will probably only find merit in this original Masterpiece. If you have to have more of Baloo, Louie, and Shere Khan though, you might first want to pick up the 1990 television series ""TaleSpin"" on DVD. That is, if you don't mind Baloo being transformed into a 1930's aviator in a world of anthropomorphic animals, ha. It really is a wonderful show. There was also a later program more loyal to the Jungle Book setting but featuring the main animal characters as children. It was called ""Jungle Cubs,"" and it was a cute show for the younger set, but it's still not available for purchase. Various live-action Jungle Book films also exist (both by Disney and other studios), and there is a fine cartoon short by Chuck Jones entitled ""Mowgli's Brothers."" Of course, the 1967 Disney animated classic is as good as it gets!",1191801600,7,10303,4.791901012373454
7125391,4,B00W605FDO,"Disney successfully weaved together several of Rudyard Kipling's original jungle stories into a fun-filled adventure for children and adults. Well-received and quite memorable, The Jungle Book is full of unforgettable characters and timeless songs, although it was unable to reach the level of emotion and passion that would later be perfected with The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast.

Bagheera the panther finds an abandoned man cub in a basket and, against his better judgment, delivers it to some fellow wolves to raise as their own. The human child, Mowgli, grows to be a favorite amongst the jungle creatures. But with the news of the return of Shere Kahn, the human-loathing tiger, Bagheera and the others decide it's best if Mowgli is returned to a human village. The boy doesn't want to go, and runs off for adventures with Baloo the bear and King Louie the orangutan before realizing that the jungle really is no place for a human.

The characters are very well-crafted and their designs are flawless. In fact, three of the characters were so popular that they were drafted into their own spin-off TV show, Tailspin. Baloo the bear, King Louie of the apes and Shere Kahn the Tiger became more personified versions of themselves in Tailspin, which was also a huge success. The character designs in The Jungle Book paved the way as templates for future Disney characters including many of those in 1994's The Lion King. Other notable aspects of the inspired animation include the voice casting of Kaa the snake, by Winnie the Pooh's Sterling Holloway, and Colonel Hathi, leader of the marching military-like elephants is voiced by Pat O'Malley.

The animation in The Jungle Book is incredibly life-like and accurate. From Mowgli's carefree hopping about in the jungle, to Bagheera's lithe lunging from tree to tree, to Kaa's bouncy coils, it is evident that each new animated feature by Disney gets more precise and impressive. The last film to be personally supervised by Walt Disney, The Jungle Book was ensured to focus on those important animation details as well as a great story. Not following a particular Rudyard Kipling story, but combining the most intriguing bits of several ideas, only Disney could create such a timeless tale of adventure, laughs and music. The film features several of the most catchy and sing-along songs ever written, including ""The Bear Necessities"" and ""I Wan'na Be Like You.""

The animation is wondrous, but with the lack of shadows and with glaringly noticeable solid colors on each of the characters, it is evident that much improvement could be made in the future. And while 1989 marked the return of Disney's winning streak with The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King, The Jungle Book marked one of the last of a run of great animated features up to 1967.

The 2-disc Platinum Edition of the Jungle Book boasts all-new digitally restored picture and sound, games and activities, the unveiling of a long-lost character dubbed ""Rocky the Rhino,"" deleted songs and a making-of featurette.

7125392,4,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book was Walt Disney's last animated classic.

It's an enchanting film based on the Rudyard Kipling stories about a young human boy named Mowgli, who lives in the jungle among the wild animals. I always find this type of movie so warm and loving. And it helps young people to love and appreciate animals.

We first meet Bagheera, a panther. The baby Mowgli is crying and Bagheera hears him. The wolf pack cares for the baby. Then, years later,the wolves are threatened by Shere Khan. He wants to take revenge on all humanity.

All sorts of problems and dangers occur.

Bagheera just about gives up in his hopes to return the boy. Mowgli, however, sees some beautiful eyes looking at him and he goes into the village. Then good things start to happen.

I didn't think the video was as clear and crisp as it could be. The audio was okay and in Dolby. If not for these two minor issues, I would have given it 5 stars.

Highly recommended.",1191801600,5,946,4.47093023255814

Fortunately for us, my kids LOST the earlier DVD and we had to purchase this new release.  No regrets!  Good job kids!!  This release is FAR superior.  The colors are far more vibrant in this version and some of the extra material is quite interesting.

Plus, this has been re-released in its original aspect ratio making it the closest DVD release to the original theatrical release.

So it's wise panther Bagheera (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) to take him to a man village where he would be safe until Mowgali runs into a lovable jungle bum bear named Baloo (Phil Harris) befriends him and goes on a journey from the ruins of jazzy orangutan King Louie (voiced by Louis Prima), the wraith of a hypnotic snake named Kaa (voiced by Sterling Holloway) and finally a battle with Shere Khan.

One of disney's most entertaining and greatest movies ever! This was the last animated movie to be supervised by Walt Disney himself long before he died. Adapated from Rudyard Kipling's novel of the same name and from the stories of ""Mowgali"", this is a charming and exciting animated movie flowing with excellent animation and memorable songs like ""I wanna be like you"" and ""Bear Necessities"". Truly a must have for every collection of animation or for family's library.

The picture and sound quality is phenomenal on this DVD and there's excellent extras like audio commentary, a new ""I wanna be like you"" music vudei, interactive jungle cruise, A documentary on the making of this movie, four featurettes, games, deleted scene with deleted character, deleted songs and art galleries.",1191628800,,1409,4.842323651452282

I noted the cropping to make it ""widescreen"" -- even though I understand that it was ""masked"" to be shown that way in theatres, as many theatres did. Both versions should be included -- is Disney ignoring today's media trends?

I went and bought the old 1999 version from a used seller instead, and I recommend that if you're a true Disney animation fan, then you do the same. Cutting off characters' heads for the sake of our HD TVs is not an improvement, and this isn't the 1970s or 1980s anymore. We have choices now, and Disney should be following suit.",1191456000,84,622,4.504424778761062

7125400,5,B00W605FDO,"Disney Studios has become infamous for repeatedly revamping and re-releasing its most celebrated titles.  THE JUNGLE BOOK is the current title on this marketing merry-go-round, and the question inevitably arises: should you replace your earlier DVD with this the new ""Platinum Edition?""  The answer is a firm ""maybe.""

Certainly there's no question about the film itself.  Released in 1967, THE JUNGLE BOOK really is one Disney's finest, a very free adaptation of the Kipling tale of a child who is raised by wolves and must break with the jungle in order to enter human society.  Beautifully animated in the classic hand-rendered style and brilliantly voiced by the likes of Phil Harris, Sebastian Cabot, Louis Prima, and George Sanders, this is a film certain to charm children and adults alike--and it is among the handful of Disney films that I have gone out of my way to keep in my library.

But do I really need all the bells and whistles of the current edition?  The re-master is nice, but I have to note that THE JUNGLE BOOK was never actually in need of a major restoration in the same way that SNOW WHITE, FANTASIA, or PETER PAN were.  It looks great, yes, but you may not notice much difference in picture and sound between the earlier DVD release and the current one.  As for the special features--I enjoyed the audio commentary and the ""making of"" feature; I was also amused by the ""lost scene.""  But I could not care less about the rest of the content, which ranges from the kiddie-silly to the uninspired.

Ultimately, your decision to purchase the Platinum Edition of THE JUNGLE BOOK rests on how much of a Disney fan you actually are.  If you can't bear to let a single item go buy, or if you are particular fan of this title, by all means purchase it--you'll find it worth the money.  And if you don't own it at all, or if you're still making do with an old VHS copy, obviously this is the way to go.  But if you do own the earlier DVD edition and you are happy with it, don't feel you have to make this ""Platinum Edition"" a priority.

Five stars for the film in and of itself!

7125401,1,B00W605FDO,"I picked this DVD up today and got it home to find that Disney had altered the original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.33:1 to make the movie ""fit"" on widescreen TVs. They did this by chopping off the top and bottom of the image. This results in the loss of a good deal of character animation (at least the tops of their heads and their feet). Trust me, I own the original Limited Issue DVD of this film and I did a side-by-side comparison as soon as I got the new Platinum Edition home. If you are a purist about original aspect ratios, please avoid this release and petition Disney to start a free disc replacement program.

7125402,4,B00W605FDO,"When Bagheera the panther (voiced by Sebastian Cabot) finds a man cub alone in the jungle, his first instinct is to leave it.  But he can't stand to do that, so he makes sure the boy is adopted by a family of wolves.  As a result, Mowgli (Bruce Reitherman) feels completely comfortable in the jungle.  He loves his home.

Unfortunately, trouble is brewing.  The tiger Shere Khan (George Sanders) has returned to the area and wants to kill Mowgli.  For his own good, the wolf pack decides to have Mowgli return to the man village.

Mowgli doesn't want to go, however, and makes life very difficult on Bagheera, who has agreed to take him.  In his efforts to stay in the jungle, he crosses paths with Baloo, a jungle bum of a bear (Phil Harris), King Louie the monkey (Louis Prima), a military pack of elephants, a boa constrictor with sinus problems (Sterling Holloway), and four vultures with perfect harmony.  But will he leave the jungle?  Is Shere Khan on his trail?

The part of me that is still a kid still loves this movie.  It's got some great laughs and lots of fun songs.  The main characters are a little underdeveloped, but they are still fun and lovable.

However, watching this as an adult, I do notice some flaws.  The animation is simpler then it needs to be, although they have some amazing shots of water here.  And the voices of some of the supporting characters seem a little flat, like they are reading a script and not really trying.

Yes, these are the complaints of an adult looking at the film now.  As a kid, however, I loved it.  And I'm sure today's kids will love it just as much as I did.",1191283200,8,1617,4.420338983050847
7125403,5,B00W605FDO,"Mary Poppins is considered by many to be Walt Disney's crowning achievement, combining almost everything he had developed in one movie, and rightly so. But after watching this new double-disc DVD release of THE JUNGLE BOOK, I think a case could be made that it also is the culmination of almost everything Walt and his studio developed in the field of animation.

Now, The Jungle Book is not the most innovative, lavish, dazzling or detailed animated feature in the Disney library. It even has those ""scritchy lines"" that my brother and I used to dislike when the studio switched to Xeroxing cels in the 1960's. But like Poppins, no other animation studio could have produced a feature with the kind of character animation; storytelling and musical interweaving that Disney could in this film.

There's a reason that the master animators and directors of today who you'll see interviewed on the second disc were influenced by The Jungle Book in their youth and used the animation as reference for their work. When I saw and heard the songs and story ideas that did not make their way into the film (and they are plentiful on this release) because Walt changed them, it will make you wonder how post-Walt movies might have been different had he lived to supervise them.

I love good audio commentaries, and disc one has a nice one with composer Richard Sherman, animator Andreas Deja and voice of Mowgli Bruce Reitherman. Thanks to Mr. Sherman, I finally found out that George Sanders does not sing the last line of ""That's What Friends Are For."" It's Bill Lee, whom Tim and I discuss at length in Mouse Tracks. (And speaking of records, the gallery contains a shot of a store display filled with Disneyland Jungle Book LP's.)

Musically, you can hear seven songs Terry Gilkyson wrote for the earlier, ""darker"" version of The Jungle Book. It's fascinating stuff. One of the songs sound like it should have been in a Rankin/Bass special. And the original demo of ""The Bare Necessities"" is very different from the version we all know.

We finally get to see what the ""Rocky Rhino"" sequence might have been like before Walt deleted it. It's also amazing to hear what ""That's What Friends Are For"" might have sounded like had The Beatles or the had either done the voices for the vultures or, after they declined, had Walt not changed his mind about having the vultures sing like them anyway. My feeling is that Walt was right about it being dated. An unintended example: Entertaining as The Jonas Brothers video is that also appears on this disc (from DisneyMania 5), if this young group actually sang ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" in the movie it would have the same era-specific pop music effect.

Disney fans will want to glory in the fresh batch of special features on disc two. Detailed examinations of how the story evolved from Bill Peet's vision to Walt's, nods to the voice talents with anecdotes about them (how everyone thought Walt was crazy for considering Phil Harris for Baloo), and lots of new and archival footage of everyone involved. Frank Thomas, Ollie Johnston and Wollie Reitherman are especially showcased, with a special look at Wollie's son Bruce's career as a nature filmmaker with an affection glimpse of his relationship with his ""Popper.""

I can't think of any DVD release with such a touching exploration of the loss of Walt for the people he left behind at the studio, since this was the last animated feature with his personal involvement. In a section at the end of ""The Making of The Jungle Book,"" there's a lot of sincere sentiment from those that knew him, loved him and were influenced by him.",1191196800,8,3619,4.753184713375796

The story of Mowgli, Baloo, and Bagheera is well-known by now; watching it after all these years has increased my appreciation of it. I highly recommend watching the Making-of documentaries first, as they will also enhance your viewing experience. Especially enlightening is the story of how Walt changed the Rudyard Kipling tale and why (and to learn that he actually returned to the original text for his inspiration of how to end his version). It is also somewhat sad to see that this was the last film to have Disney's indelible stamp on it due to his death, yet also inspiring to hear the animators talk about what they put into the film as well as future animators who were inspired as youngsters by viewing it. Different concepts along the way are interesting to see, and not surprising to learn that Phil Harris put much of his own personality into the dialogue and characterization of Baloo. The other extras are fun too, including the games (although some could benefit from better instructions, such as the follow Kaa's eyes game).

7125407,5,B00W605FDO,"With so many Disney DVDs to choose from, is ""The Jungle Book,"" even a new ""Platinum"" version, really a must buy?

Absolutely. Just 78 minutes long, this unpretentious adventure is full of imaginative characters, charming song and dance routines, interesting themes and innocent good humor. Unlike many Disney films, ""The Jungle Book"" doesn't strive to be high art and has no groundbreaking special effects, but it's still one of the company's best animated films. And now the film has now been ""digitally enhanced,"" with a brighter contrast and cleaner colors.

Telling the tale of Mowgli, a human boy brought up in the jungles of India, the movie is a freewheeling adaptation of some Victorian-era short stories by British writer Rudyard Kipling. Rescued as an infant by a protective panther named Bagheera, the boy is raised by wolves and adopted by a carefree bachelor bear, Baloo. Disney punches up the stories with Western jokes and music (the pop soundtrack includes Baloo's and orangutan King Louie's infectious scat duet ""I Wanna Be Like You"" and Baloo's perky prickly pear primer, ""The Bear Necessities""), but wisely eliminates Kipling's patronizing overtones.

""The Jungle Book"" teaches children a number of good life lessons. It demonstrates that the world includes enemies as well as friends, and that enemies sometimes disguise themselves as friends. It argues that though its fun to pretend you're someone you're not, it's best to accept the person you are.

It has two lessons about love. First, that true love is unselfish, as Baloo learns when he realizes he must finally return Mowgli to the ""man village."" And second, as Mowgli realizes in the final scene, that the ultimate male fulfillment is the love of a good woman. Or, as my husband views the segment, the pursuit of a wide-eyed flirt.

Parents can take note of a classic Disney touch: the acceptance of both religion and science. The film begins with the infant Mowgli lying in a basket along a riverbank, a reference to Moses that's not in the Kipling stories. Later, however, there's a nod to Darwin, as the orangutan King Louie greets the human boy with an outstretched hand, saying ""Shake hands, cousin.""

If nothing else, adults can enjoy identifying the distinctive character voices (Kaa is voiced by Sterling Holloway, the Cheshire Cat in ""Alice in Wonderland"" and best known as Winnie the Pooh) or laughing at the chorus of Beatle-like vultures. One looks just like Ringo. Sounds like him, too.

Funny how almost anyone you ask will side with either Baloo or Bagheera, depending on their personality.

""The Jungle Book"" wasn't one that I grew up watching, but I LOVE it every time my son, my wife and I sit down and enjoy it together. If you haven't seen it, you should.",1123459200,,668,4.520661157024794

It certainly reveals the expertese of those who made the movie and how ahead of their time they were in the graphics and how talented they were in producing the result they did without all the technology that we have today.

A must have for all DVD buffs!!!

My wife and I ordered this movie two months ago. Since then, we have watched it four times, each time with increasing enjoyment and delight at new nuances that come out with each viewing.

This movie is a masterpiece, the likes of which you see only once in a generation. Each character is fantastically rendered, with great voiceovers, lovely songs, hilarity, and a non-sentimental warmth. The story marches right along. There is not one dull moment in the entire movie. The drawings and the expressions are top-notch and superbly done. The photography and the artistry, as well as the recording itself, are breathtaking.

Disney should re-release this movie and make a new Broadway musical out of it. I really think this could become their biggest thing ever in terms of merchandising, movie ticket sales, theater income, and themed advertising.",1116374400,3,924,4.910256410256411

7125425,5,B00W605FDO,"This is my favorite of all the Disney animated movies.  The combination of voice talent, good music, and the quality of the story all combine to make it a near perfect movie.

""The Jungle Book"" is Rudyard Kipling's story of Mowgli, a boy raised by the wolves in the jungles of India.  Mowgli cavorts with his buddies Balloo, a lazy bum of a bear, and Bagheera, a worry-wort black Panther.  His very menacing enemies are Shere Khan, the tiger, and Kaa, the sibilant python.  It's a child's dream tale of life in the jungle, free from the restraints of school and parents and civilization.

The highlights of this movie are nearly endless:  Phil Harris is superb as the laid-back Baloo; George Sanders plays a tiger with upper-class diction and (one suspects) unusual sexual preferences;  Louis Prima belts out a showstopping musical number. The Elephant march is touching, funny, and toe-tapping.  Mowgli himself is a charming, sunny boy.

Mowgli is a forerunner to the likes of Tarzan. It boggles my mind to think of the imagination -- the daydreams -- Kipling must have had to come up with this story.

I was just desperate to see this movie. I loved all the Disney animals stories and *The Jungle Book* turned out to be my favorite. The lively songs, lush animation, compelling characters, and strong storyline left quite an impression on me. Can never forget the loving and gentle Bagheera, that kooky monkey, and Baloo, Baloo the lovable bear. Ooh, and that sinister Shere Khan striking fear in the hearts of all and the slithering sneaky snake always up to no good. The voices used are wonderful and fit the characters to perfection. I was in heaven, and it has stood the test of time by remaining one of my favorite animated films.
I just wanted so badly, just longed to be a girl version of Mowgli. Raised by wolves, living wild and free in the jungle, playing with the bears and apes. Climbing trees and swinging from vines. Yep, that was the life for me. I sobbed at the end, crying: No, Mowgli, don't leave your animal friends behind and live with people. You are making a big mistake!

7125428,5,B00W605FDO,"The Jungle Book is one of our families two favorite Disney movies (the other is Mary Poppins).  As close as can be expected to Rudyard Kiplings book, The Jungle Book is the story of the boy Mogli who is raised in the jungle by a pack of wolves, with Bagheera the panther as a close family friend.  One day, SherCan the tiger returns to the jungle, with a special hate for mankind.  It is decided that for the wolf pack's safety, Mogli must go.  Bagheera offers to return him to the ""man village"".  Of course, Mogli doesn't want to leave the jungle, the only home he has ever known, so he slips off into the jungle and has a grand adventure.
The Jungle Book is a movie that even the adults in our family don't mind watching more than once.  The story is good, the gags are funny, the adventure is gripping (for a children's movie), and the score is really and truly one of the greatest and jazziest ever put to a Disney movie.  In fact, our five year old loves the songs so much, that it sparked an new interest in jazz music in our home with the family!
I highly recommend this movie to any family looking for whole-family fare.  Unlike some of Disney's more modern fare there is no implied sexuality, short skirts, or bloody bullet wounds.  Just 100% wholesome family entertainment.",1084233600,,1283,4.4025423728813555

7125430,4,B00W605FDO,"Disney's 19th animated film tells the story of Mowgli, a young human found in the wreckage of a small boat by the panther Bagheera.  He takes the young mancub to a family of wolves who raise the boy as one of their own.  10 years go by, and news begins to spread that the tiger Shere Khan, who distrusts Man, has returned.  Fearing for Mowgli's safety, Bagheera agrees to take Mowgli to the nearest Man village, where he will be protected.
Mowgli, however, doesn't want to leave the jungle, the only home he has ever known.  He runs away from Bagheera and meets Baloo, a happy-go-lucky bear, and decides to be like him in order to stay in the jungle.  It's up to Bagheera to convince the two of them that Mowgli will be safer in the Man village.  Together, the three set out against the many hilarious and menacing obstacles that await them on their journey.
A Disney classic, one of the best things about this movie is the voice work: Sebastion Cabot as the up-tight panther Bagheera; Phil Harris as the ""jungle bum"" bear Baloo; George Sanderson as Shere Khan, giving him almost an upper crust dignity; and in two of the best roles in the film, jazz star Louis Prima as the orangutang King Louie who wants the secret of man's fire from Mowgli so that he, too, can be a man; and Sterling Holloway as the sly snake Kaa who only wants the mancub for a tasy meal.  The film is also full of great music, including ""Trust in Me"" and the ever-popular classics ""I Wan'na Be Like You"" and ""The Bare Necessities.""

Mogli is a young boy who was orphaned when he was a baby and then was found by a pack of wolves. Now that Mogli is older, Shiar Khan the tiger, wants Mogli dead. Now the wolves and Bagira the panther have to bring him back to the human village to be with his own kind and for his own safety. Mogli wants no part of that and while running away from Begari's sight, he runs into Baloo, a fun loving Bear who teaches Mogli how to have a good time and the ""Bear Necessities"".
I really love this movie. This one is a lot of fun. I only had one problem with this movie and that was a little animation recycling in the ""Friend Like Me"" scene with King Louie (if you saw ROBIN HOOD or ARISTOCATS, you'll see what I mean). But even that wasn't enough for me to take off a star. I still think this is a 5 star Disney classic.

But I felt like I had to make an exception when it came to Disney. All of their ""Limited Issues"" seem to have little or no extras at all, but the actual animated classic that the disc holds, for me anyway, more then makes up for it.
""The Jungle Book"" is one of the first Disney Movies that I watched as a kid. I bought the DVD, and I saw the movie today for the first time in around 12 years. The entertainment value is suprisingly still there, and more over, as a grown up movie fan, I can appreciate the film more as a classic in animated films from Disney & not just a 'cartoon' to pass the time, like I considered it to be as an adolecent.
The picture and sound is satisfying for the film's age and genre; the Spanish Dubbing is an excellent addition, for some of my family anyway. But it pales in comparison to the English vocals; The animation is terrific, too bad it wasn't created in a widescreen aspect ratio, it would have been a great visual to have looked at (The film is presented in it's original theatrical aspect ratio, 1.33:1).
Now that the announcment of Disney's 10 ""Platinum Editions"" have been made (The first of the 10 being ""Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs"", but ""Jungle Book"" will be one of the other 9), this ""Jungle Book - Limited Issue"" is a fine way to have the film until the full-fleged ""Jungle Book - Platinum Edition"" is released sometime in the next decade.
