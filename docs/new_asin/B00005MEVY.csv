1624560,5,B00005MEVY,"One of the better documentaries I've seen on the subject. Recommended for later generations of Americans of Japanese ancestry to appreciate what happened to their people in WWII, their suffering and sacrifice.  Students of American history may also find this interesting.  The interviewees bring to light several important lessons of U.S. history:  the Constitution (guarantor of our rights) is only a piece of paper, racism is a recurrent problem in America and the currency of freedom is blood.",1190505600,24,496,5.333333333333333
1624561,5,B00005MEVY,"Great DVD.  You can learn about historical things that are never even mentioned in school.  If you want to learn more, visit Manzanar National Historic Site near Lone Pine, California.  The National Park Service maintains the facility with an excellent museum and re-creation of many of the features from 70 years ago.",1397088000,,318,5.076923076923077

1624563,5,B00005MEVY,"This is actually 2 separate movies. Both are great and true-to-life accounts with great acting. If you are interested in military/war history, this is a must have.",1375315200,3,163,5.074074074074074
1624564,5,B00005MEVY,I am a WW2 history buff. I live in LA and saw the memorial for the 442 and it inspired me to get more info on Japanese American Soldiers during WW2.,1373760000,4,148,3.806451612903226

1624566,5,B00005MEVY,An interesting historical document and the Hollywood movie made of this little known part of WWII history.  The most decorated U.S. unit in American history and the obstacles they faced.,1287964800,3,186,5.2
1624567,1,B00005MEVY,This was a little too dry for my intent.  I had difficulty staying focused.  I am sure my high school students would find it quite soporific!,1241308800,,141,4.384615384615385
1624568,4,B00005MEVY,"Good historical documentary on the World War II Internment camps established by the U.S. government under the questionable guise of ""military necessity.""  Also, information about the 442nd regimental combat ballation
and its role in the course of World War II and on the Japanese-American citizens held in the Internment camps.",1236988800,3,327,5.54
1624569,5,B00005MEVY,"I purchased this DVD for my husband. His uncle, Leo Kikuchi, was in the 442nd, so this was especially meaningful. We both really enjoyed this documentary, it was very well done and so very touching. Unfortunately I don't recall learning anything about this in my history classes in school and only found out about the internment and 442nd when I met my husband. Outstanding video!",1231200000,11,380,4.861538461538461
1624570,5,B00005MEVY,"This was a well done documentary on the internment of Japanese Americans during WWII that I didn't learn about until I finished high school and learned it from talking to friends and neighbors. The producers and directors did an excellent job giving background info and shorts that were used as commercials back then to justify the action taken at the time.  Many of the men in the 100th/442nd never talked about their experiences until just recently, even to their family or spouses.  They were able to speak to the interviewers and that was a lot of history and emotion pouring out..a job well done!!!  I thank the people involved in making this  long due documentary.",1217116800,22,670,4.8

7945233,5,B00005MEVY,"For a low budget production, the staging of the war scenes is excellent.  I was also impressed with the screenplay.  The direction serves the story-telling perfectly.  A sequence about the taking of a bunker is completely clear story-telling--without dialogue!  The Japanese and Japanese-American actors are tremendous.  Sad the racism of the time didn't allow these fine actors to produce a greater body of work.",1453507200,2,413,5.390625

7945236,5,B00005MEVY,"A first-hand account of vets - striking that their spouses had never heard them talk about it until filming.  I wish they would have documented more of these 442nd stories, but now the vets are mostly deceased.  Bonus dvd included. Good for all to watch.",1431820800,,254,4.622222222222222
7945237,5,B00005MEVY,This movie is an important one to tell because my parents were both interned and they never talked about it until they saw this movie produced by my Uncle Yukio Sumida. When ever I see my cousin Ray speak it tears me up. My grandfather lost his fishing boat and livelihood. A family rented and saved my grandparents house in Monterey. My parents were never bitter. Thank you to the family who rented and saved their home.,1429315200,,421,4.48051948051948
7945238,5,B00005MEVY,I remember the movie from my youth and wanted to look at it again now that I know the history of the unit.  They did not mention that it was attached to the All Black 92d Infantry Division in Italy.,1402272000,,198,3.95
