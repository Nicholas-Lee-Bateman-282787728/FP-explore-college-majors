8166460,5,B000M5E32E,"Brenda's Lateral Thigh Trainer is a must, when purchasing a Lateral Thigh Trainer.  The Original Lateral Thigh Trainer is No Longer Available.  However, there are Later Thigh Trainers Available.  Brenda's porogram starts off for a beginner and gradually works up to a more advanced level.  Your leg muscles are greatly improved along with the tendons,with much more stamina.  I suffered a major knee injury to the back tendon on my left side in back of the knee, which made it difficult to walk at times to very painful.  The exercises in Later Thigh Trainer by Brenda, completely healed the tendon.  For me it is a more than excellent product.  Her video should be included with ALL Lateral Thigh Trainer's, with Linda getting a commission with each sale.  Again,  I rate her video as more than exceelent.",1358035200,3,806,4.860294117647059
8166461,5,B000M5E32E,I was so excited to find this video.  My old video I had for about 10 years.  I love this workout and was excited to see you had it.  It came to me fast.  I wish you had this in CD also so it would last a lot longer.  All-in-all I am excited you have the video.,1355443200,,261,3.508771929824561
