2120638,3,B0002UNQ5Y,"The orchestra under Levine and the singing are great. Mattila has a radiant voice and Heppner is fine too. But the acting is simply awful. Beckmesser is made into a silly fool with a sour expression almost all the time as if suffering from severe indigestion while Mattila's Eva is flighty and flirtatious when she ought to be restrained and demure. Morris is too too American in manner to be a convincing Sachs. And Polenzani is a bit hefty for a young journeyman. The Bayreuth video with Weikl and Prey and Jerusalem is almost as good musically and infinitely better acted. It has much nicer sets too. This Met production makes the final ""meadow"" look more like a car park than anything else.",1112659200,7,694,4.650406504065041
2120639,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"let's get one thing straight from the start: james morris as hans sachs is not my cup of tea.  not to say he doesn't sing and play the role admirably, or that he's not killer in other parts (wotan, boris godunov, etc.).  its just that i prefer a lyric heldenbaritone (ie. brendel, weikl, otto edelmann) as sachs, not a bass.  based on that, i don't feel like i can fairly judge the man's performance here.

ok, that said, this a masterful recording of wagner's most human music.  if you are a fan of opera generally and a fan of wagner specifically, buy this DVD soon.

here are some of the selling points, working from the top down:

heppner as walther: fantastic.  maybe he's not everyone's textbook definition of a heldentenor .. but who cares.  he has a big, shiny voice that sounds fresh right through the punishing end of the opera, and keeps this nice lyrical momentum pulsing through all of walther's ardent music.

mattila as eva: also world-class.  totally immersed, believable acting, gorgeous voice and looks, passionately musical.  she sheds some new light on how to sing and play the part, which at worst can be thankless, numbskulled tone-machine.

thomas allen as beckmesser: right on.  a little evil, and still willing to 'sing' (gorgeously) when the music calls for it.  when not, sticks to typical half-bark/parlando beckmesserism.

pape/polenzani:  the monologues of pogner and david are usually snoozers, but not so here.

its no big secret that the mets sets, costumes, orchestra and chorus are unmatched in grandeur and detail, so it doesn't bear repeating here.  one could argue that levine keeps the orchestra a little too tightly reined-in (just a moment or two of wild bombast would be nice .. it is wagner, for gods sake) at times, but overall they play gorgeously and sensitively to the singers.

meistersinger is an enormous chunk of art, and new recordings of it are understandably few and far between.  be thankful that there is a new one this year, and that it is this damn good.",1108771200,52,2012,4.790697674418604
2120640,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"This is a truly excellent example of one of the greatest operas reproduced in stunning sound and visuals.  Levine and the Met orchestra get the tempo just right, and they sound superb. What is also amazing is the quality of the vocal sound, which is captured in great detail, when clearly there is not a microphone in sight.

The soloists are excellent...the one that stands out for me is Beckmesser who is usually a caricature clown...whereas the part is played straight and very convincingly.  The Mastersingers are all first rate. Hans Sachs is cast with a natural modern look, and unlike the usual god-like Wotan. Perhaps the only criticism is that both Walther and Eva look middle-aged at best, and while their singing voices are good, they are unable to bring the sense of romance to the opera that would be more convincing with younger artists.

The great advantage of the DVD media over the earlier CD versions  (I loved the Karajan 1952 Bayreuth version best), is that not only do you have the option of helpful subtitles, but you can also see the excellent detail in the staging that fills the lack of action with incredible detail. It is never boring. Most of the stage settings look like a Rembrandt painting. I just wish that one of the optional subtitles was the detail of the orchestral score.

Highly recommended on all counts.",1108684800,32,1343,4.742489270386266
2120641,3,B0002UNQ5Y,"There are 2 main problems with this big-time Met release of Wagner's only mature comic opera:  James Levine and James Morris. The first Jim has never been able to ""feel"" the structure of a Wagner opera like he ""feels"" the structures in Verdi.  The second Jim has let his minor bad habits from his Wotan days take over, so that his voice has become thin and unattractive, and his technique makes unfortunate use of the barnyard gamut from croaking to barking.

From the first limp bars of the intro negating any sense of occasion, it is evident that this performance is going to need qualifying.  A flaccid overture leads to the ugliest first-act set I have ever seen (and I've seen quite a few).  Luckily the first voices to be heard (Eva, Magdalene, Walther) are all good, so that interest and enjoyment are revived.  David's long monologue is not as tiresome as it sometimes can be, and the extended passages for Kothner and Pogner are also engaging, although, as mentioned by another reviewer, Rene Pape looks too young to be Eva's father.  (He could have at least grown a beard for the role.) Morris' initial vocal exchanges with his learned colleagues emphasize the coarseness of his timbre, but as Hans Sachs he is extremely handsome and sensitive, so despite the ugly sound he gains our sympathy.  Thomas Allen begins his delivery of a flawless Beckmesser, and Heppner wins our sympathy in the opposite manner of Morris, i.e. by using the sweetness and strength of his voice to overcome the awkwardness of his physical girth.

The second act allows Karita Mattila to show her considerable acting gifts, and the set is beautiful and naturalistic.  Sachs' Fliedermonolog is dull, although Levine does manage to keep things moving along.  The Night Watchman actually steals this act with his full, piercing sound. When this happens, something is DEFINITELY amiss.

The opening of the third act, which is the longest of all, is so slow it almost comes to a standstill.  Poor Morris can barely sustain a phrase within the tempo he is given, and battles to stay in synch with the cruel Levine.  This Wahnmonolog, Sachs' deepest dramatic outpouring, utterly fails because of this struggle. And it doesen't help that Morris has absolutely NO low notes anymore.  Hence the growling.  Then Levine decides to speed up the final section of the monologue to such an extent that any sense of proportion or arc is obliterated.  Luckily, once Heppner appears again, Levine regains his sensibility.

Mattila's vocalism is seriously tested in this act, and she succeeds only with obvious effort.  Her high note on ""Oh Sachs, mein Freund"" is there, but somewhat screechy, and, whereas she sustains the opening phrases of the quintet quite elegantly, she is somewhat flat at its climax, which, thanks to Levine, is hardly a climax at all.  The prize song is the jewel of this performance, both for Heppner and Levine.  I have never heard a better one, and I found myself rewinding to hear it time after time.  Too bad there are still 10 more minutes of Morris to listen to, although he looks resplendent in his robe and triumphs dramatically with his gentle fatherly demeanor.  The Met Chorus is fantastic, as is the recreation of the Nrnberg environs.

This performance, with all of its flaws, does evoke the spirit of Wagner's creation, if not as effectively as the Bayreuth staging with Bernd Weikl.  Weikl owned the role of Sachs for over a decade, with good reason.  But until Philips releases this version on DVD, the Met performance serves as a satisfactory, even sometimes illuminating, document. Thank Heppner for that.",1106784000,37,3615,4.875613747954174
2120642,4,B0002UNQ5Y,"This is a glorious opera production with some of the finest voices in the world.  Pape and Heppner are glorious, and Morris has made Hans Sachs his own.  The David is superb.  In short, the DVD is certainly worth the money.

But visually, it's a bust.  Happner is 325 pounds and too old for his part.  Karita Mattila is too old for Eva; she's older than Lena.  And watching her sing is painful at times.  Worse, are the apprentices: they're way too old to be German lads, and a good number of them are black and oriental.  Even worse: Two and perhaps three of the apprentices are product placement.  They appear in far too many scenes, being displayed prominently.  ""Here she is again,"" my wife and I laughed.  It gets embarrassing by opera's end.  Thumbs down for the stage manager.",1106006400,10,783,4.507142857142857
2120643,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"Let's start with the technicalities. The picture and sound quality of this disk are superb! The picture is anamorphic wide screen (even though the box describes it as 4:3) and gives crystal-clear reproduction of Gil Wechsler's 'Old Master' lighting effects. The DTS 5.1 sound faithfully reproduces the ambience of the Met (even including the guy with the cough, a few rows down on my left), and is outstanding for a live performance.

The performance? It's the Met - what do you expect? Levine and the Met Orchestra were in top form, extracting every bit of humor and pathos from some of Wagner's most beautiful music.

I must confess that I was worried that James Wotan Morris could handle the essential humanity of Sachs, but I needn't have bothered - he was perfect. It was strange to see him singing with both eyes open, though.

Thomas Allen's Beckmesser was a tour de force, reminding me of Hermann Prey. Not only does Allen sing well, but he is an excellent physical comedian. The scene in Sach's workshop was hilarious. He also managed to convey Beckmesser's malice - essential if he is not to be perceived as a pathetic victim.

Ben Heppner's Walter was outstanding. It is said that nobody plays Walter well. Mr Heppner did. He's the first good Walter I've ever seen.

Rene Pape's Pogner was beautifully sung and acted, but I can't help feeling that he looks a bit young for the part. Well, that's my fault for not suspending disbelief properly - his performance was impeccable.

And now Karita Matilla. I'm probably going to be lynched by one of her rabid followers, but I don't think she makes a particularly good Eva. Her voice was superb, and all that, but there has to be a chemistry between Eva and Sachs, and it just wasn't there. I don't think it was the fault of Morris, either.

My favorite video production of Die Meistersinger is the 1984 Bayreuth production with Weikl as Sachs, but unfortunately it isn't available on DVD. Until it is, the Met Meistersinger will ably take its place.",1105833600,109,2006,4.714285714285714
2120644,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"I own about 75 Opera DVD's. This Met production of Die Meistersinger is one of the best. Up till now I have found the Met's Wagner DVD's to be rather undramatic. This Meistersinger comes as a wonderful surprise! It is a lovely traditional production that avoids being stodgy. The singers are actually acting, looking like they are having a good time, and they are actually funny!!!This Miestersinger is a joy!

I havntecountered a better sung Meistersinger since the old mono Kempe recording from the 50's. This is a well nigh perfect cast. I will single out two wonderful performances. Heppner is the only Walter I have encountered on stage or on DVD who is truly up to the part of Walther. He is as fresh in the third act as he is in the first. Almost all tenors peter out by the third act and croak out a facsimile of the prize song. James Morris is a singer usually rather dislike. I don't like the sound of his voice and I find him dull. Here he seems to have found a role that really suits him. He seems enlivened by the role of Hans Sachs, he really takes to the ""everyman"" that is Sachs. His voice also fits this commoner more readily then the God Wotan.

This is by a wide margin the best Met Wagner Opera DVD, certainly better sung and staged then the two other Meistersinger

DVD's now on the market.",1105574400,19,1311,4.386831275720165
2120645,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"A fantastic production of Wagner's comic opera, with excellent singing from all the principals. A must have for Wagner fans",1103587200,5,123,5.2
2120646,4,B0002UNQ5Y,A great one!!!,1414454400,,14,4.0
2120647,3,B0002UNQ5Y,"First of all, the one strong point: Ben Heppner is an excellent singing-actor who really brings Walther von Stolzing to life.  I enjoyed watching this performance because of him.  He's hundreds of pounds too fat but it stopped bothering me early in the piece because his personal charisma is so compelling. He has clearly thought his role through very carefully; his acting is nuanced and also heartfelt.  He's especially convincing in the Act III dialogue with Sachs just before he composes the Prize Song.

Unfortunately, he pretty much has to carry the performance all by himself because the other singers deliver average performances at best.  James Morris' vocal prowess is adequate but he sings quirkily, punching notes and sliding from note to note at inappropriate times, and his acting is wooden.  Sachs is supposed to suffer from doubts and feelings of inadequacy, which he resolves by helping Walther, right?  Morris seems to have nothing at stake in this performance.  For plumbing the depth of Sachs' character Donald McIntyre's performance on video with the Australian Opera is much better.

Karita Mattila is also only average as Eva, and Rene Pape (a heavily overrated basso IMHO, not in the same league as Matti Salminen or Kurt Moll or Hans Sotin) is too boring for words.  Levine's conducting keeps the musicians together, but it also sprawls and lacks tightness.

Another reviewer was lionizing Thomas Allen's Beckmesser, but I don't see it--to me he seems dull and not at all funny.  Again, the Australian Opera gets much better character-acting from comic baritone John Pringle, while for really virtuoso, note-perfect singing of this incredibly difficult part, Eike-Wilm Schulte's performance with the DeutscheOper is the best on videotape IMHO.  (Schulte is also a fine actor.)

So get this for Heppner if you can spare the dough, but don't let it be your only MEISTERSINGER.",1411430400,2,1899,5.123376623376624
2120648,5,B0002UNQ5Y,I love the opera. Too bad the Met's production was so cheesy.,1410998400,,61,4.166666666666667
2120649,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"This was a breathtaking piece of music. I have always loved the brass associated with Wagner. The cast in this opera was par excellence. Beautiful music sung by Ben Heppner, James Morris, Karita Mattila and the rest of the cast. The chorus was terrrific. Last but not least the glorious conducting of James Levine. This piece represents the Germany that my grandmother knew before she came to the United States. Wagner was one of her favorite composers. She especially liked the procession of the meistersingers and the brass and choir in this piece.",1399852800,2,550,4.924731182795699
2120650,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"This performance of Mastersinger is GREAT! When PBS broadcast this in my area they squeezed the picture up to the top and put the subtitles in the black area at the bottom. I'm at war with PBS for this reason. And I didn't buy this for a long time thinking the disc would be treated the same way.

This program is full screen, and comes out correctly proportioned on my widescreen TV. The image is sharp and clear and a delight to watch. The Met staging is beautiful. Nothing modern, not brought up to date as some other productions I have seen. They're on YouTube, and so is this, and after seeing that not all recordings of this opera got the PBS treatment, I had to have it. When the MET does a traditional production you can count on them to do a great job.

I've read other reviews of this and other operas I own, and I guess that I love Wagner's operas so much that I don't get overly critical about the singers. Face it, if they're singing at the Met, they can sing. Your only going to get perfection with a studio recording, and I still enjoy the Decca Solti Ring cycle, on CD or reel to reel tape. The Bayreuth production of Mastersinger is good, and it is traditional production too, but the Met's larger stage allows this production to shine. The DTS 5.1 audio is to die for.

I'm so glad I finally bought it. I'll have to set aside 292 minutes again to sit down and closely watch and enjoy this ""great performance"" again.",1397433600,4,1433,4.3
2120651,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"My wife and I enjoyed this performance very much.  This comedy by Wagner is quite different from his more seious operas and worth checking out even if you don't like Wagner's other operas.  James Morris was absolutely wonderful as Hans Sachs, projecting his dignity, wisdom, intelligence, and humor very convincingly.  Ben Heppner sings very well in the role of Walther von Stolzing.  Thomas Allen is hillarious as the pseudo-villain Sixtus Beckmesser.  The young Matthew Poenzani was also funny as the apprentice of Hans Sachs, David.  It took us 3 nights to finish this since my wife was too tired to watch all 4.5 hours in one sitting, but We both enjoyed it.",1386288000,2,662,4.866071428571429
2120652,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"My only regret in reviewing this set of DVD's is that I can't give it more than five stars.  It seems to me it is just about perfect.  Both the video and the sound are sharp, clear and lifelike.  Visually, it's like having a choice orchestra seat at the Met, equipped with a pair of good opera glasses.  Such a seat for one performance would of course cost many times the price of these of disks.  As for the sound, this is a very fine performance and the fidelity is excellent.

A couple of other customers have complained that James Levine's conducting is too slow.  I don't know what they are talking about.  I think his tempi are just right.  I've heard this music performed under many conductors over the years and compared to what I remember, there is nothing unusual about this performance.

We don't generally expect comedy when thinking about Wagner's work, but this is in fact a funny opera, and the only opera by Wagner that could be called funny.  Some of the humor is broad and crude, as when Beckmesser makes a fool of himself trying to sing a song that is too complex for him.  And much of it is gentle and even subtle, as when Sachs reacts to Eva's complaints about the shoes he has made for her.  Unlike most of his operas, this has a happy ending and nobody dies.  If one wants to try a Wagner opera but is concerned that it will be too dark, violent or mysterious, this would be a good place to start.",1380067200,2,1420,4.309433962264151
2120653,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"Great singers all around. I admit it; I love James Morris. He is so fine, as are Mattila, Heppner, and Allen. A young Polenzani sings very sweetly. Pape is one of the finest baritones singing today and never disappoints.",1368057600,,220,4.666666666666667
2120654,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"I missed my bus and had to kill four hours back when I was around 20 years old, so I went to the library media room and decided to satisfy the curiosity a friend had engendered in me regarding Wagner's Ring cycle, so I listened to Die Valkure, reading along with the libretto and was hooked, big time. Over decades of listening to the darker of Wagner's works I remain loyal to the music, though the angst can become somewhat tedious at times, especially when the performance and production are lacking. Don't get me started on the MET's new 'machine'.
Then gradually I became aware of Die Meistersinger and it has been growing on me ever since. It's Wagner, believe it or not, with hardly a cloud in the sky and it is pure joy. We're not talking intense, heart wrenching drama here, in fact the storyline is quite pedestrian, but the music is glorious. This is fairly late in Wagner's career and I can't help but think that this was his love poem to music. In fact, making music is the theme around which the story revolves.
When I've fallen in love with an opera through listening, I am always a bit cautious about watching a performance. A poor realization can actually have quite damaging impact. I saw clips of this performance on YouTube and I was sold. The performance is really well cast and the singing and acting are great. The quintet in the third act is to die for - perfectly rendered, and the finale is glorious. James Levine at his best. I'm not a big fan of massive stage sets but even this one works for me.",1366675200,5,1524,4.427046263345196
2120655,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"This particular dvd recording is absolutely thrilling..the cast is fantastic.  It is a long opera but one is so into it that the time just flys....it's an unbelievable experience.  If you love Wagner, this is one of the best dvd's out there.",1362441600,,241,4.714285714285714

2120657,1,B0002UNQ5Y,"What a travesty! James Morris can barely sing, swooping and scooping into every note. He has no concept of the role which is typical for him. Levine's conducting, as in all of his Wagner, is terrible, having no understanding whatsoever. He rushes for cheap effect then slows to a crawl to appear ""sensitive."" Having Thomas Allen as Beckmesser is interesting as he should be Sachs with a superior voice and richer tone. In this case we have Beckmesser giving Sachs a singing lesson! Heppner is fine as Walter but not great. The opera depends more on conducting and the Sachs, both absent here. Anyone who praises this garbage obviously doesn't know anything about Wagner and their reviews should be ignored. A number of Bayreuth performances from the past (especially von Karajan's 1951 performance) are far superior.",1356912000,5,816,5.007352941176471
2120658,4,B0002UNQ5Y,"The production values were very fine indeed, especially considering that the recording was of a live stage performance.  The orchestra, singers and chorus were first-rate in bringing to light a very challenging score.  My only reservation is that the production faced a virtually unavoidable problem: modern technology permits the viewer to see the performers close up, in a way that was not generally possible back in the ""good old days"" of opera houses. Thus, Heppner and Mattila, both excellent performers, looked way too old for their roles - and, with Heppner, too corpulent.  This matters, at least to me, when they are seen seemingly just a few feet away from us in our living room.  Part of it is also Wagner's fault.  His vocal requirements have favored - no, mandated - top-notch singers with appropriately ""mature"" voices.  Singers of that type and caliber - ""Wagnerian"" singers - are not very plentiful, and physically attractive ones to boot, for the heroes and heroines, even less so. A related issue is also brought about by the close-up reality.  For instance, Hans Sachs looked much younger than Pogner, a detail that could have been corrected by the make-up people but wasn't.  On the whole, however, the issues raised were too minor to distract seriously from our enjoyment of the production.",1356652800,,1311,5.009216589861751
2120659,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"I cannot claim the knowledge of opera and the tenors, basses, and sopranos shown by other reviewers. My limited knowledge includes playing Aufzug die Meistersinger in junior high school orchestra in 1959.  I suppose I have always like Wagner. I also like happy endings. This show synthesizes the story, the music, the voices, the staging, the costumes, and the video production into an incredible work of art.  The Met has so much talent on which to draw in every artistic discipline.  It is certain that the stars aligned for this show!

Forget that you read that the treatment of Beckmesser is viewed by some as anti-Semetic.  Forget that Adolf Hitler allegedly liked it. Forget any nit-picking reviews. In my opinion, this production of Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg is a must-have. Morris' rendition of Hans Sachs is something to behold.  I wish my city and state and nation had someone of his stature to respect.  Mattila's voice and her interpretation of Eva is magnificent.

The perspective of a video is so much different from that of live theater.  I cannot sit in the first balcony with 10x50 binoculars to see every whisker and line in the faces and every nuance of expression.  The video, with many close-ups, brings that to me.  When you can see every movement of the face and eyes, the ability of the principals to act, not just sing, is magnified many times.  I have to give Morris and especially Mattila the highest scores for their acting as well as their singing prowess.

My two years of German was over 40 years ago, so I had to have subtitles.  It was slightly disappointing that there was action on the stage that was not reflected in the English subtitles.  Next time, I'll watch it with German subtitles and hopefully see what I missed.

Be prepared to devote half a day to watching this performance.  The production runs just a few minutes short of five hours with no breaks.  I believe that if you enjoy good music, good singing, and happy endings, you will not be disappointed.  Feel free applaud with the house audience at the final curtain calls.",1335052800,2,2076,4.7325905292479105
2120660,3,B0002UNQ5Y,"For me  Hans Sachs is the key to  Meistersinger. This opera works best if his character is played with the presence, depth, warmth and confidence, and the vibrant timbre  of voice that, for example, Bruce Martin brought to the Sachs role in the 2003 Opera Australian Opera production. On that occasion Donald Shanks sang Posner, Michael Lewis was Beckmesser and Simone Young conducted an extraordinary production, of which sadly there is no recording.
I look for productions with that hallmark, and wonderful though it is, I somehow do not find that the Metropolitan production quite gets there.",1311379200,,595,5.11340206185567

It does have its slow moments but let's blame Wagner's long-windedness rather than this production.  James Levine leads the Met orchestra with his usual crispness and attention to detail. The sets and costumes reflect 15th century Germany with uncanny realism.  My only complaint is that the menus need more chapter markings rather than just the acts.  This is ome you should check out.",1261440000,3,528,5.069767441860465
2120662,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"As an old Wagner dog of 60 years standing, I have to say this is an extraordinary DVD, and must have been one of the great nights at the new Met.  Only the fact that Heppner looks, as one wag has put it, like Wallace Beery in drag, detracts (but he sounds glorious! and acts well enough)--and, well, the close-up camera occasionally reveals that the otherwise beautiful Mattila is perhaps not exactly 18. She, too, sings like an angel, and acts with great specificity.  The actor par excellence is Thomas Allen, as Beckmesser, who is simply amazing, and he too is in fine voice, even commanding a high A towards the end of his role.  Polanzani, as David, is also excelleent, though again perhaps not exactly appearing the age of his part.
The central figure, however, is absolutely magisterial:  Morris looks, acts, and sings exactly as one dreams Sachs might.  He still has all the voice to command, and it is clearly the best heldenbariton since Hotter, his teacher in Wagnerian roles, and in fact I find it a bigger, warmer and more moving voice, qua voice, than his predecessor's.  His interpretation is deeply moving.
Levine conducts a glowing performance--you know it's going to be that way just from watching the sheer joy he derives from leading the orchestra through the Act one prelude.
The camera work is unexceptionable, and I have very glad to have these images of a solid, traditonal staging--no Eurotrash here.",1256169600,13,1425,4.795918367346939
2120663,4,B0002UNQ5Y,"I have watched all three main productions and would give them five stars plus an extra bonus to the Australians for their realistic acting ability under Mackerras. But I have one gripe of all of them that irritates me, i.e. the clumbsy transition from the closing bar of the overture to the church; it just doesn't work, there's no getting away from it. In my opinion, the orchestra should either complete the concert overture and applause, then start Act 1 with the quiet intoning of the organ and choir, or choose a more appropriate point in the overture to transist to the church scene.",1251936000,,589,4.673076923076923

If you love Meistersinger, you will probably give this DVD 5 stars.",1186358400,3,285,4.72
2120665,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"I know this opera very well, having played it several times (violinist) and heard/seen it many more times.

I believe this is the finest opera DVD I have seen. It is full of the visual charm needed to place it in its context as a German opera, and musically it is superb. The acting, lighting, scenery and costuming are matchless in my experience. Every part is sung/acted convincingly, even though not all the singers seem perfectly suited to their parts in regard to age.

2120666,4,B0002UNQ5Y,"As with most MET DVDs, this one is brightly filmed; the sets are generally colorful and realistic (i.e., look appropriate to Nuremberg rather than Aunt Lizzie's broom closet or some such).  The orchestra is first class, and the singers mostly do justice to the work.

Why not five stars?  An opera DVD can compromise somewhat on the voices (as this one does), but it lives or falls on the sets, direction, and acting ability (as well as appearance) of the singers. (If you desire the best voices, look for an audio recording -- the Kubelik, the second Karajan, or the Sawallisch are good bets from the vocal/orchestra perspective.) Here's where my reservations enter:

1. Although the sets for Acts II and III are what one would expect (and accomodate the crowd scenes well within the limitations of a stage), the set for Act I is terrible.  After the magnificent overture (a little too stately from Levine, but that's his style), the curtain rises on the congregation in song.  Done right, this can be a powerful visual experience.  What the MET does is place the chorus behind a wooden screen with a single doorway (through which Eva can be seen), so the visual impact of the church scene is lost.  It's as if the viewer were a church mouse peeping out of the rector's closet.  The visual doldrom of this set contributes to what seems to be an extra long Act I (again, Levine's tempos don't help either).

2. This production suffers from the all too frequent perverse relationship between singing and acting/appearance.  The best singers (Heppner, Mattila) are the worst actors and/or the actors that appear least appropriate for the role.  (Although Heppner hardly looks like a dashing young knight, at least he gives some representation to the weight challenged among us (including me) who are underrepresented in most of the entertainment world.)  Morris looks ok in the part, but his voice shows significant signs of wear (especially in Act I; things improve, curiously, as the opera progresses).  The exceptions are Allen (Beckmesser) and Pape (Pogner) who both sing and act well.  (Pape would have been better as Sachs.)

3. Although the MET orchestra plays beautifully, there is a sluggisheness to the proceedings.  Levine prefers slow tempi; that can work in Parsifal (it does in the 1979 and 1985 broadcast performances; less so in the 1993 filmed version)and Mahler (in my view he is an underrated Mahler conductor).  However, Meistersinger requires more sparkle; you can't find that here despite the excellence of the sound.

As for comparisons, I have only seen a portion of the Australian opera production with McIntyre as Sachs; overall, the MET production is superior.",1168041600,15,2685,4.953125
2120667,4,B0002UNQ5Y,"This is pretty good. Basically, it provides an understanding and appreciation of an interesting opera that is in the main repertory. We should all know about Meistersinger. Nevertheless, it isn't continuously melodic or full of arias. Ben Heppner is excellent, his voice and articulation are at a very high level. He does the key song in a wonderful manner. James Morris acts very well, but a touch of the warmth may have left his voice at this stage of his career, nevertheless, he is enjoyable to watch.",1162512000,2,505,4.816091954022989

2120669,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"Fortunetaly for Meistersinger fans, there is no a plethora of decent to good options on DVD, even more so now with the recent addition of Horst Steins marvelous Bayreuth account fully remastered on DVD. Before Stein, this would be my first choice, though the australian dvd is very good and at times better.
James Morris does a good job here, though his voice has diminished slightly from his superior Wotan portrayal. His acting is poor and he seems uncomfortable with his monologue beginning act three. His voice still has that beautiful buttery quality-which saves the performances somewhat. Ben Hepner was the Walther on DVD till Siegfried Jerusalem returned in Steins, which now is the frontrunner-though Heppner is very good/ I would have to say that Karilla Mattila is the finest on DVD, which isn't saying much. Rene Pape is, as always, stupendous(He plays Pogner).
The staging is fantastic-though the first act drags and is dull. The final Johannestag festival is marvelous, by far the best on disc, though in Steins it is interesting to see sachs, beckmesser, and Wieland shake hands.
Both Beckmessers are particularly fantastic and will vary depending on preference(as everything does in music) but they are worth mentioning because both are so marvelous.
The met plays wonderfully though faithfully to to Levines mannerisms which admittedly are fewer here than in his previous Wagner attempts.",1158278400,8,1405,5.1938325991189425

2120671,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"I love this opera and along with Parsifal it's my absolute favourite piece of Wagner musik drama.  I often wonder how he would have developed if he had continued to write about 'real people' and explore their feelings and emotions (instead of all these Gods and lovers under the influence of potions, etc).  In my opinion, this is as good as anything Verdi or Mozart ever did to bring genuinely ordinary humans onto the stage.

The music is just fantastic and here Jimmy and the Met provide us with an amazing experience.  My hat comes off to both music director and orchestra.  Bravi in the loudest shouts!!

I think this production is excellent too and the chorus deserve every second of their ovation at the final curtain call.  I remember Peter Alan (much missed by our houeshold, I just can't warm to Ms Juntwaite - sorry) on the broadcast of December 8th, 2001, saying 'You'll be pleased to hear that tonight's performance has been taped for television.  One not to miss.'  How right he was - I can't recommend this DVD enough.  In fact, I've copied mine to a CD for listening in the car.

James Morris is absolutely perfect as Hans Sachs, what an actor and singer.  His interaction with all sections of this cast is a joy to see.  A wonderful performance - as is Karita Mattila - that lovely little jesture with the laurel crown as the curtain falls at the end, is the final cherry on top of the icing of a very lucky cake in this mesmerising production.

Tom Allen is the Beckmesser in Covent Garden's Meistersinger and just as in London, he's perfect - and reminds me of some penickity people I know!!!

David and Magdalene are well sung as is the Night Watchman.  In an evening of such perfectness my only minor quibble (and it is minor) is Ben Hepners's Walther.  I disagree with other reviewers about his acting, I always find him a touch wooden and less involved than the others.  Interestingly too, on the Met Matinee relay of December 8th he cracked on two notes in Act II & III - so if this is the taping of that relay then the recording must have been digitally enhanced to cover that up.  So acustomed to listening to the origianl radio relay I psyched myself up for the first cracked note, which, when it didn't come made me think - 'Oh, they've done somthing to this!' - and I'm glad they did.  However, I must confess that I still find him to be the the weak link in this very strong chain, but it's knit picking of Beckmesser like proportions!

If you haven't already invested in this DVD, then I hope you do.  You'll be in for quite an evening.  This is opera on TV at it's very best.  I wish I'd been there!",1147219200,13,2631,4.410788381742739
2120672,5,B0002UNQ5Y,"It's hard to imagine a better performance, even given that Mattila is not a brilliant actress, though she makes up with enthusiasm and sheer charm.

The orchestra and Levine do a more than competent job.  Not a lot is needed to make this work shine (notwithstanding some of the reviews above); everyone involved seems to love this piece --though it's hard to say with Morris; several decades of Wotan can't make it easy to see all things anew-- and rightly so.

Karita Mattila is a wonderful soprano, with one of the most beautiful faces I have seen.  She plays Eva as an eager, precocious young woman, but I don't think she gets it *quite* right.  (I'm a lot better at imagining the middle ages than most people, and I can't think anyone alive today could get that character just right, and still sing Wagner, but that's just my opinion...)  But that's the beauty of it; you don't *have* to get it perfect to make a wonderful DVD.  Mattila has a glowing voice, as close to a lyrical soprano as you can get in Wagner opera.

Heppner has sung this role with Mattila before (I know of Chicago and Solti, for instance, at least for a audio recording), and he really is both a good actor and an excellent tenor, not a heldentenor, which would, IMHO, not be appropriate.

James Morris brings a great controlled stillness to the role of Hans Sachs.  Wagner depicted Sachs as a patriarchal figure, struggling to emerge from his middle age with grace.  Morris manages this easily; the close-ups show the details of his facial expression (which the theater audience probably would have not been able to see), climaxing in the third act with an outburst in which he deplores being the universal uncle (though he complains ostensibly of being a cobbler).  The outburst --the emotional climax of the opera-- is quelled, or perhaps resolved, by young Eva, who declares her love for him in such a way that Sachs finds it possible to be the Uncle once again, and help the young lovers.  Wagner can be forgiven much for this scene: so human, so forthright, yet so restrained--for Wagner!  But the Wotan Wobble is present; love me--love my wobble, says James Morris.

The supporting cast is better than excellent, from the comical Beckmesser, to the inept but loyal couple of Lena (Magdalena) and David.

View this at your peril, Wagner-haters!

2120673,3,B0002UNQ5Y,"This version is an undisguised copy of the 1951 Beyreuth production and suffers from being produced in the New World where many things can be done well but few, excellently.  The Metropolitan is in this mould - whether it is Vaudeville or Wagner, both will be done with great competence but without brilliance.

Brilliance, alas, is what is needed in Wagner and it is a pity that the orchestra and chorus cannot be given a conductor of equal ability.",1146528000,4,450,4.6835443037974684
2120674,5,B0002UNQ5Y,I attended the live performance that was filmed to make this DVD. It was one of my all time favorite Wagner opera performances. There was great chemistry between James Morris and Karita Mattila. Ben Heppner was his usual great self. Matthew Polenzani who is a relative new comer to the Met was a delight. The last scene in the live performance was electric. Unfortunately the DVD doesn't fully capture the magic of the performance although if you hadn't seen the live performance the last scene on the DVD is a knockout.,1138665600,8,520,4.725274725274725
2120675,2,B0002UNQ5Y,"The best parts of this Meistersinger are Ben Heppner's Walther and Karita Mattila's Eva. Heppner is in gorgeous voice for Walther, although his girth literally can get in the way of the action and the viewer's enjoyment (Brian Large's all-too-frequent closeups do not help). Mattila is the best actor on stage, an infectious, lovely Eva in fine fettle. Her interactions with Heppner provide most of the spark on stage. Thomas Allen's detailed and insightful Beckmesser, and the refulgent sound of the Met Orchestra are also high points.

James Levine's Wagner has never been to my taste - too ponderous, with little line or shape (unless, as they say, round is a shape). Most of the big moments here - Sach's two monologues, the quintet - lack any fire, any conviction. Too often, when Levine does get any momentum going, it is in such contrast to what has preceded it, the music simply does not hold together. Knappertsbusch also took slow tempi in Meistersinger (although judging from his superb 1952 Bayreuth version, not nearly as slow as Levine). But Knapperstbusch knew how to sustain the line and didn't force his singers into levels of discomfort like here.

James Morris' Sachs is a case in point. Under Levine's heavy-handed approach, Morris is stretched to where his wobble becomes even more pronounced. The voice is just not in very good shape. His low range is pretty shot and the vocal weight is not there. His acting, too, leaves something to be desired; Morris is pretty stiff, often resorting to simply crossing his arms and looking uncomfortable. An insightful, wise poet-cobbler he is not. When I saw Morris as Sachs in San Francisco, one of his finest moments came at the end when he approached the scorned Beckmesser and put his arm around him, a touching, consoling gesture. Here he is not even close to Beckmesser at the end, instead swamped by the masters. An opportunity lost.

The masters also often look pretty uncomfortable, resorting to petty reactions in Act 1 that belittle their own tradition. Watch the masters in Fruhbeck de Burgos' touching DVD version with the Deutsche Oper, and you have a totally different feeling. They may be stodgy, resisting Walther's radical new singing, but they still have a dignity and tradition which makes their dilemma compelling, and which eludes the Met's masters, who too often seem petty and childish. Sets here are traditional but drab, not enlivening the proceedings.

Without question, the Fruhbeck de Burgos version is far more inviting. Better acting, inviting sets, fine voices throughout and buoyant tempos make it a wondrous experience, full of humanity. Meistersinger frequently brings a lump to the throat and Fruhbeck's performance delivers in abundance. Other than Walther's prize singing and Mattila, this one too often is a drag.",1122249600,39,2813,5.043010752688172

I just don't care for Morris's sleepy and wooden Sachs, and Mattila was an overly exhuberant Eva. Dasch/ Volle had the most convincing chemistry of any duo I've ever seen in this music drama. Their acting was so convincing  they made me get caught up in the drama to such an extent  I found myself letting some of the most glorious music ever written pass over me without my full attention being directed to it. Dasch made me feel the poignancy of her feelings for Sachs in a way I had never experienced before. .Her facial expressions were perfect. Totally right each moment, never glancing at the condutor or being distracted from her character. I have this Morris/Heppner DVD and I love it, but would quickly give it up for the

Volle/Dasch anytime should it become available. I am hoping the Met will see fit to release the HD on DVD soon. I would grab it up immediately.

Having watched the recent (Dec 1014) ""live"" (in a cinema) Met production (remake) of this, I must say that there were several individual performances that were better in the latter, but the overall technical production values in the former were superior. I may pick up the recent Met production when PBS inevitably offers it, but this version is better, IMHO.",1419292800,,395,5.0
8032086,4,B0002UNQ5Y,"This Met production from 2002 has all the qualities one would expect:  Levine is solid and competent, if not inspired, in his conducting, the orchestra plays exceptionally well, and the chorus is terrific. Traditional sets and costumes, sumptuous to be sure, are somewhat compromised by the murky staging and lighting in the first two acts. However, things brighten up considerably in the last act.

Karita Matilla impresses as a fetching if tad mature Eva. James Morris makes a thoughtful, avuncular Sachs and his warm baritone is just right for the characterization. I confess I have issues - at least visually - with Ben Heppner's Walther. He sings beautifully - it's hard to imagine a better prize song. But his heft, combined with his age - he looks almost as old as Sachs - makes for a tough sell in the suspension-of-disbelief department in accepting him as a young Turk and frontrunner suitor for Eva.

But no qualms with Thomas Allen's Beckmesser, who almost steals the show as the character Wagnerians love to hate. Wagner no doubt identified with the Walther and Sachs characters but there was more than a little of Beckmesser in him. Allen gives us not the usual caricature but a real person: by turns insecure, jealous, proud, sneaky, idealistic, well intended, sentimental. Allen's exceptionally sympathetic account of a not so sympathetic character presents Beckmesser in a fresh light. And when the score allows him he delivers some fine vocal work.

Which brings us to my only other quibble with this production: its opting for Beckmesser to flee the proceedings in the last act. I much prefer the version where he returns and is welcomed back by Sachs as a full-fledged Meistersinger. It seems to be better in keeping with the opera's humanity and warmth. Four stars, but just barely.",1418083200,,1802,4.956953642384106
