8133217,5,B000GJ0KQ4,"A crazy sense of humour needed here to appreciate any of these movies.  There are 4 discs in the set so 4 opportunities to be terrified with craziness and laugh your bits off.  You have to be a bit warped and crazy to appreciate the humour in these discs at times.

My daughter just loves Leslie Nielsen, he was a riot. He makes these movies even funnier.",1349395200,8,256,4.586956521739131
