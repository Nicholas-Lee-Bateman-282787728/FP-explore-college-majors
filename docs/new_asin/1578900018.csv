196665,2,1578900018,"Altho in another Gilbert & Sullivan operetta review, I urged finding D'Orly Carte performances, I failed to add that when this can't be found, the ""Opera Australia"" versions are VERY good, and staged in imaginative style.  ""The Goldoliers"" is the very best done by Opera Australia, on DVD with the Kultur label.  Excellent!  (So skip this version).",1209427200,,348,5.0701754385964914
196666,4,1578900018,"As a long time fan of Gilbert and Sullivan I have enjoyed many good productions and suffered through many a painful one.  This series is wildly erratic in its quality, but The Gondoliers is one of the good ones.  My acid test -- I showed it to my 15 year old niece and her three 16 year old friends -- all of them really enjoyed it.  So did I!  It is greatly enhanced by the libretto -- which unfortunately was not included in the box.  I brought out one from another resource and when referenced and some historical issues were addressed my niece couldn't wait to see another.  Very enjoyable addition to any collection, for watching or just listening.",1206748800,2,653,4.445378151260504
196667,3,1578900018,"On the plus side of this production are the scenery, costume and dancing.  From that standpoint it is useful to view this video.

I must agree with those who say that great material was turned into a yawn.

I quote a reviewer, ""The cast does not seem to be having any fun, the hallmark of a good G&S performance.  They are not sharing the joke because they are so pre occupied with their technique.""

The older actors are especially guilty on this count--in particular, the actor portraying the Grand Inquisitor, Don Alhambra del Bolero.  This character should be throwing looks at people that terrify them.  Instead, the actor gives boring looks and so the rest of the cast has very little, if anything, to motivate a response on their characters' behalfs.

Where are the raised eyebrows, the tongue in cheek, the knowing smiles, the sneers?  British humour can be dry ... but this production is dry to a fault.  There is a balance between laughing at your own jokes and not laughing at all.  Unfortunately, this production falls on the boring--even perfunctory--side of the laughter spectrum.  No G&S production should leave you thinking the actors were apathetic, but this one did.",1189987200,,1184,4.835820895522388
196668,4,1578900018,"This is by no means a perfect performance, but I consider it the best of the series.  It is intact, excepting small (though funny) parts of the dialogue and the second verse of Antonio's song (""For the Merriest Fellows are We"").  The singers, I thought, were all quite serviceable and well cast.  The worst problem, as with all of the Brent Walker G&S videos, is overacting, cheap sets, and bad camera work.  However, those iniquities are less in this one and it is quite serviceable.  It captures the spirit of the opera, at least, and we are not left to groan over bad acting and singing as we are in the other videos.

  Considering that this is practically all we have in the way of recorded G&S, I think it deserves four stars.",1114128000,12,732,4.451127819548872
196669,3,1578900018,"I recently worked with a local Gilbert and Sullivan theater company to put on ""The Gondoliers,"" and it has been interesting to compare the live show with this particular film production. Opera World has done a surprisingly good job with this low-budget version; while the sound quality is still poorer than could be wished, the choreography and filming are infinitely better than those used in their disastrous rendition of ""HMS Pinafore."" Particularly outstanding are the performances of Don Alhambra (Keith Michell) and Marco (Francis Egerton). Michell's soft-voiced Alhambra is an interesting contrast to our own bellowing and confused one, and his cold condescension contrasts well with the boisterous Gondoliers and their wives; while Marco has less to do and say in the operetta than his brother Giuseppe, his incredible facial expression and quirky additions (such as the rose between the teeth during the Cachucha in Act II) give him at least as much on-screen presence. Giuseppe (Tom McDonnell) comes off as somewhat stiff and ill at ease during the first act, but begins to settle into his role during his aria ""Rising Early in the Morning."" The sound and choreography flag somewhat during the Duke's song ""In Enterprise of Martial Kind,"" but are made up for in full by the charming Gavotte in Act II. Casilda and Luiz aren't given much to do, but they make the most of their time on screen with the lovely duets ""O Rapture! When Alone Together"" and ""There Was a Time.""
 Musically ""The Gondoliers"" is one of Sir Arthur Sullivan's often-overlooked gems, and W.S. Gilbert's keen humor is as fresh and on-target as in his widely recognized works, ""The Pirates of Penzance,"" ""HMS Pinafore,"" and ""The Mikado."" While Gilbert and Sullivan are something of an acquired taste, for hard-core fans this production is still worth watching. If you are interested only in the music, I recommend buying a CD version instead; but if you're looking for something more, Opera World has produced a version which is quite satisfying.",1056499200,20,2023,5.0568862275449105
196670,1,1578900018,"Your editorial review is correct but understates the technical problem with the sound in this whole series. The excess reverberation, poor audio production, and the English accents make this almost indecipherable by North Americans. I get the feeling that the director is very visually oriented, but he tries to get cute and technical. The trick shots are just too contrived. The cast does not seem to be having any fun, the hallmark of a good G&S performance. They are not sharing the joke because they are so pre occupied with their technique.
I far prefer the series done at Stratford in Canada rather than this candidate for Madame Tusaud's museum.",1011484800,10,652,4.9363636363636365
196671,2,1578900018,"I never believed that Gilbert and Sullivan could be rendered unfunny, but this cardboard production manages to produce the impossible. they have turned one of the funniest, most dynamic plays to a static yawn. The singing on a whole is pretty good, but the sound quality and acting are terrible. I'd say go for the Stratford production: while the voices may not be quite as good (and for many of the singers are)--the Canadian production is far better at catching the sparkle and playfulness of this play.",980035200,6,505,4.816091954022989

7799309,4,1578900018,"It is really hard to add anything to L. E. Cantrel's excellent and comprehensive review from 2008!  Really I just want to add my four stars to the overall rating.  It's not a brilliant production, but it manages to fit in almost all of the songs (and comes with a libretto, which helps when the diction or sound aren't perfect).  It's certainly better than most of the other productions in the BBC/PBS series, which are often very curtailed and embarrassingly bad. The introductions by Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. are almost superfluous, but to my surprise I found the other obligatory celebrity appearance, Keith Michell as the Grand Inquisitor, very enjoyable.",1500336000,,657,5.009174311926605

7799314,2,1578900018,"The wide range of reviews here shows that not everyone likes the same thing. Personally, I thought the singing was superb, but the direction was a mixed bag, with characters either mugging for the camera or standing stiffly like statues, and shots that seem too close, too far, or not focused on the action. They also cut out some of the funniest jokes, presumably to make it shorter for television. Still, I was left with a smile at the end, mostly due to the wonderful music, which holds up well no matter how many times I hear it.

7799316,5,1578900018,"The Gondoliers was the last successful operetta by Gilbert and Sullivan and, in my opinion, it is their best work. Yes, H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance, and The Mikado are more famous -- and all are good enough to deserve their fame and popularity. But, for The Gondoliers, Sullivan requested a libretto which would allow him for once to write truly great music and not just a collection of catchy songs -- and, fortunately, Gilbert complied with this request. As a result, the music of The Gondoliers is consistently outstanding. Fortunately, the plot is very clever and humorous and, consequently, this is one of the greatest operettas ever written by anyone. Even if you don't think of yourself as a Gilbert and Sullivan, I think you will love this great operetta if you will try it. This is a fine performance of it.",1332201600,3,829,4.763888888888889

CONDUCTOR:
Alexander Farris with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Ambrosian Opera Chorus.

SOUND:
Minimally acceptable 1980s analogue stereo, but no more.

PRODUCTION STAFF;
George Walker, executive producer; Judith de Paul, producer; Peter Wood, stage director; Dave Heather, video director.

PRODUCTION:
This production of ""The Gondoliers"" adheres quite closely to the ""traditional"" form of production established by W. S. Gilbert, who was not only the author of the piece but the stage director and set designer as well.  Like the stage version, this video production is essentially a two-set show.  Act I is placed in a sunny Venetian plaza with a practical canal up stage.  Act II is placed in a throne room of the palace on the Mediterranean island of Barataria.  The Act I set is quite handsome and obviously intended to capture the warm, muted colors and general look of 19th Century Italian genre paintings.  The Act II set is more generic in nature, a bright open hall and not much more.

The costumes for the main principals are again traditional.  The Duke, Duchess, Casilda, Luiz and Don Alhambra are all decked out in the fashion of aristocrats and their servants in the days of Louis XVI.  (The costume designer missed an intended visual joke, however, in failing to differentiate between the threadbare state of the Duke and Duchess in the first act and their well-heeled sartorial splendor in the second act.)  Marco and Giuseppe are (traditionally) garbed as late 19th Century gondoliers in Act I and uncomfortably (again traditionally) as joint-King of Barataria in Act II.  The chorus, on the other hand, are not handled traditionally at all.  Despite their repeated insistence that they are respectively ""contadine,"" peasant girls, and ""gondolieri,"" gondoliers, the women are dressed as fairly sophisticated town girls and the men are clearly Venetians of every employment but that of gondolier.

It should be noted that the choristers not singing solo parts are far too good as dancers to be any believable group of real singers.  It is clear that the Ambrosian Chorus recorded their numbers, while dancers mouthing the words appeared on screen.

TEXT:
Unlike too many recent productions of the masterpieces of G&S, this ""Gondoliers"" is quite faithful to both the words and music of its creators.  The major musical cut is the second verse of Antonio's song, ""For the merriest fellows are we.""  The spoken dialogue has been subjected to some trimming but mostly left untouched.  There are, thank heaven, no feeble ""improvements"" or lame ""updatings"" to either words or music.

DOCUMENTATION:
Libretto, showing the lyrics as used in this production.  Spoken dialogue is omitted, being replaced in the libretto with a sentence or two summarizing what is said.  The DVD is infested with the absolutely wretched nuisance of poor old Doug Fairbanks, Jr., offering appallingly inept introductions to each of the two acts.

COMMENTARY:
From 1875, with ""Trial by Jury,"" to 1889, with ""The Gondoliers,"" W. S. Gilbert and Arthur, Sullivan had an unbroken string of eleven successful comic operas, some of them, ""H.M.S. Pinafore,"" ""The Pirates of Penzance,"" ""The Mikado"" and ""The Gondoliers,""  becoming world-wide smash hits. ""The Gondoliers"" was the end of the line.  There were, indeed, two more G&S collaborations, both of which did well enough in their original productions, but both the partners and the general public knew that the magic time had passed.  (From the last years of the late 20th Century, revivals of the last two shows, ""Utopia, Ltd."" and ""The Grand Duke"" were successfully mounted with some regularity, but they are still not quite on a level with the great eleven.)

Around 1980, the BBC ordered production of the eleven G&S shows then regarded as worthy of revival.  A major aspect of the financing of the project hinged on the participation of the American PBS, hence the lame introductions from the familiar figure of that thoroughly Anglicized American, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.  Budgets were tight and closely watched.  The shows had to fit within a two-hour broadcast slot.  Every show had to have at least one ""star"" performer who would be familiar to the home audience.  In this case, it was Keith Michell, who had gained international fame as Henry VIII in ""The Six Wives of Henry VIII.""

The show is well-sung--except, of course, for Keith Michell, who is weak and miscast.  His part, the Grand Inquisitor, can be done as a charming, sunny old chap inexplicably caught up in an unpleasant profession or as a menacing monster on his best behavior, a sort of tiger come to afternoon tea. Michell is neither, offering only a vacuum on the stage.  The Duke of Plaza-Toro, for his part, gives a perfectly straight-forward reading from beginning to end, failing time after time to bring out the laughs in one of the great comic characters.

Overall, the impression provided by this ""Gondoliers"" is generic and bland, reflecting the pick-up nature of the cast, the short rehearsal time and the absence of practical experience performing as a group before the public.  It's all right, I hasten to add, but it could have been so much better.  Still, as the competing productions from the Canadian Stratford Festival and the Australian Opera have demonstrated with such exquisite clarity, it could have been worse, oh, so VERY much worse.

Four slightly dubious stars ... until something better comes along.
