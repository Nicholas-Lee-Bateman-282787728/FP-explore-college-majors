8142466,5,B000HXDWKA,"I highly recommend this series for helping students with writing research papers. If you buy the whole series, it will take you from picking a research topic to completing the final draft. I have been a college professor for over 20 years, and I was looking for a series on writing that I could recommend to my freshman classes for additional help with writing their final term research papers. I found this series, and the response from the students have been positive. Even though these DVD's are a little expensive, I am pleased to say that it was worth the money I paid. You don't have to be a teacher to see the value in this series, anyone from high school to college will gain an in site on how to write a better paper from this series. If your struggling, or simply starting out in your academic writing career, I highly recommend this series.",1355443200,,851,4.496774193548387
