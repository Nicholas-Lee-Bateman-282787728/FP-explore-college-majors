7899767,2,7501557225,"Saloms Arsne bears such little resemblance to Maurice Leblancs character that comparing the two is necessary to writing a fair review. While the film does have some redeemable qualities, overall its an extremely poor portrayal of one of French literatures most famous anti-heroes.

It goes without saying that I found the writings of Maurice Leblanc to be interesting and compelling. This films main character is not compelling. Arsne is portrayed as nave, young and cocky in this film. It runs contradictory to Leblancs Arsne, a smooth, calculating and often whimsical character. It was as if Salom misunderstood Leblancs mercurial mastermind and simply opted for portraying him as a young, cocky hood with above average sleight of hand prowess.

Saloms Arsne never once creates a masterwork of genius proportions: no highly intellectual heists are to be found here. Romain Duris is simply in over his head with such a multifaceted character (at least it should have been a multifaceted character). While some may think the films Arsne should stand on his own, Saloms lead character just isn't that interesting.

As other reviewers have noted, I found the thieving scene on the cruise ship to be extremely idiotic. The thief is shown stealing the necklaces and jewels off the rich socialites gathered at a party. He did so in plain sight and is found out almost immediately. When hes finally caught, Arsne runs from a mob of socialites at a comically slow speed,  knees kicking up to his chin, arms flailing, a scene Salom must have found amusing but came across as pathetic. During scenes like this, Saloms Arsne comes across like a French Jim Carrey.

Leblancs character is cunning, often devising intricate plans to break into high profile areas and steal items of great importance; he rarely robs valuables off peoples persons like a two bit thief. In this film thats all he does. Saloms character is not really Arsne Lupin at all: hes an amateur thief and fencing guru with the same name. Not even the characters history and background is the same (Leblancs The Queen's Necklace creates a detailed and emotionally compelling character in less than 13 pages).

Arsne Lupin tales are almost always told from the top down starting with the acknowledgment of a theft, the story involving Arsne followed by the escape (then often sentence or two from the Echo de France!). Nothing like that exists here since Saloms character is not one that values thinking and planning. The end result is a boring, conventional film that you've probably seen with another name half a dozen times before.

You may want to rate this film on its own merits and flaws but it would be difficult to do. For some reason Salom felt the overwhelming desire to stay true to some elements of Leblancs work while abandoning others. The names of characters are all from Leblancs Countess Cagliostro (among other stories), but they bear little in common with their on screen representations.

But for all the films faults there are some positive elements. The films cinematography, costume design, makeup, set design and overall quality is terrific. All of the scenes are appropriately lit, costumes spot on for the time period and all filmed with an artistic flair worthy of mentioning.

One of my favorite scenes is where Arsne as Prince Sernine re-introduces himself to his former lover (Eva Green) and attends a high society party with her. The various rooms in the house are expertly lit with artistic use of mood lighting and the costumes are terrific. Prince Sernines cosmetics are outstanding: the character is barely recognizable as Duris and seems to resemble Jeff Bridges instead. Truly a transformation worthy of Leblancs Arsne Lupin.

Eva Green (Clarisse) and Kristin Scott Thomas (Josphine) are great and tug at the main characters heart in believable ways. While some may find his character shallow, I was a fan of Pascal Greggorys portrayal of Beaumagnan/Thophraste (although the characters entire back story was terrible).

I cant honest recommend this film to anyone. Fans of Leblanc will detest the on screen portrayal of his beloved characters. In my opinion, the films redeeming qualities - the cinematography and visual presentations - aren't worth the price of purchasing or renting this film.",1410912000,,4288,5.050919377652051

7899771,3,7501557225,"As far as I know, this is the only movie of Kristin Scott Thomas' or Eva Green's that's never been released in the United States, so North Americans who want to see this movie have to make do with this Canadian release (which fortunately does have English subtitles).  Arsene Lupin is a famous fictional character in Europe, but is best known to Americans chiefly because of his anime grandson, Lupin the Third.  In fact, the relative obscurity of the original Lupin in America may explain why the film has never been released here. The movie itself is OK, though not a world-beater; the main reasons to watch it are, as another reviewer noted, to enjoy Scott-Thomas' delicious femme-fatale performance as Countess Josephine, and also the sumptuous production values, especially the costumes.",1273968000,4,792,5.038167938931298

7899773,2,7501557225,"French caper action ""Arsne Lupin"" (2004) is about the titular character, gentleman thief created by Maurice Leblanc, and depicts his romances and adventures in his earlier days. Though many sources on the net indicate that the film is (loosely, I suppose) based on ""La comtesse de Cagliostro,"" I cannot be perfectly sure as I haven't read the original book.

Anyway, Roman Duris (""The Spanish Apartment"") plays Arsne Lupin, dashing young jewel stealer who gets embroiled in the Royalist plot by saving the life of Countess Cagliostro (Kristin Scott Thomas), to whom the young thief is attracted. Eva Green (""Casino Royale"") also appears as Clarisse, Arsne Lupin's childhood friend and another love interest.

The film's convoluting story that goes on more than two hours defies easy summery, but I can say it includes one conspiracy, two romances and semi-kung-hu-type actions (one featuring shirtless Duris himself, who is a pretty good fighter), and bit of mesmerism and lots of gorgeous costumes and productions. The film is always easy on the eye, and photography is beautiful, but because of the pointless actions that are squeezed into the thin story, the film itself does not know where to go. The film fails to make us care the characters who do not know what they want to do, and its tone changes too much from comical to violent.

Eva Green is beautiful, but is relegated to a meaningless role and her fans wouldn't like the way she (or her character) is treated in the film. Kristin Scott Thomas fares better with delightfully campy acting as femme fatale (who might be using sorcery!), but soon it becomes evident that she has nothing to do except that. As to Roman Duris's Lupin, he is allowed to show only his cheeky and corky side of the character. He is barely convincing as lady's man, but not as future gentleman thief and master of disguise until the film's ending.

Two stars for sumptuous productions and Kristin Scott Thomas' (intentionally) over-the-top performance as the vamp-ish Countess.",1174176000,17,2014,4.9851190476190474
