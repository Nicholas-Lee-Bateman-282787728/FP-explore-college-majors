8506205,5,6303322999,"This film is an update of Linda Moulton-Howe's Emmy award-winning TV documentary about the cattle mutilations (though they might be more correctly described as `dissections'), focusing on those in North America, originally broadcast in 1980.

Many in the UFO research field feel that in recent years the credibility of LMH's output has declined, and her work is less respected now than 30 years ago. However all would acknowledge that back in the early 1980s, the original work on the cattle mutes placed her centre-stage as a pioneering reporter bringing uncomfortable facts about this worrying phenomenon to public attention. This work remains some of the best-ever in the field, and the plaudits and awards which followed were entirely deserved.

The film is excellent, and recommended viewing. Ranchers in several states, law enforcement personnel, veterinarians, surgeons, members of the military (the helicopter connection) are all interviewed on the record, and the carcases of mutilated cattle are shown to demonstrate the very precise laser-like surgical techniques used by the perpetrators to remove eye tissue, flesh from the jaw, udders and sex organs whilst apparently ignoring the rest of the animal. The animals are found in odd locations with no tracks around them, even on soft ground or snow - not even their own. Possible culprits are methodically discussed, one at a time: military/government agencies; satanic cults; natural predators; pranksters: all ruled out for logical reasons. The only possible responsible agency which fits the observable evidence is UFO occupants; UFOs were witnessed at the scene of the crime by several of the ranchers interviewed in the film. If this is true then official silence on the issue is understandable.

It's difficult to understand why, in 2011, this documentary is not available on DVD. However, you're stuck with 1980s technology: videotape is the only format available. If you can get over that irritant, then you should see this film. It's documentary film-making of the highest calibre, the subject matter is important and these mutilations continue to the present day with little variation in modus operandi by the perpetrators.",1312761600,8,2194,5.39067055393586
