3041912,4,B000ZIZX9A,"Ben 10 is one of my son's favorite cartoons. We got the whole season for him for very cheap. Cheaper than Wal-Mart. We haven't had any problems with it....plays well, no scratches, etc.",1211155200,2,185,4.636363636363637
3041913,5,B000ZIZX9A,"I was watching TV (Cartoon Network, of course!) with my younger brother's boys, and my younger sister's girls. Shows like Kids Next Door, and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, two shows okay for kids, but left me talking to them about the cartoons that ""I"" watched when I was their age: The Herculoids, Space Ghost, etc. They sat there listening to me talk about these shows, and how cool they were to me, when my youngest nephew says ""Ben 10"". I asked them what that was and they tell me its about a boy that can turn into 10 alien monsters to fight bad guys, kinda like the cartoons that I watched, but way better! It comes on right after Foster's. Well an hour later (they showed two episodes in a row of Ben 10) I was hooked! Ben 10 has a very interesting storyline (even for adults), and very cool Alien/Monster designs. The two episodes I watched dealt with ""Ghostfreak"" one of Ben's aliens escaping from the Omnitrix, and trying to merge its form with Ben's so it can survive in the sunlight, and commit horrible things. This was actually kind of a creepy character, and a dark story, I loved it! And so did the kids. As I said before, I was hooked! I watched this show every chance that I could with them, and now I own them all in the 3 DVD sets that have been released so far.
If you are an adult that still likes cartoons, or just want to have something that is very fun, and entertaining for the kids to watch, you need to get Ben 10!",1207958400,10,1449,4.2727272727272725

3041916,4,B000ZIZX9A,"I can't believe that the third season of ""Ben 10"" is out on DVD already !  Why not ""Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends: Season 3"" ?  Or ""Ed, Edd n Eddy: Season 3"" ?  Ah, well....

Ben, Gwen, and Grandpa Max continue their greatest road trip ever with some crazy adventures along the way to places beyond belief.  This DVD set has thirteen more episodes such as:

""Ben 10,000"" - Ben and Gwen are hurtled into the future where they meet grown-up versions of themselves who are in need of some help.

""Merry Christmas"" - The Tennysons enter a holiday-themed village where Grandpa Max has been kidnapped by a villain who thinks Max is Santa Claus.

""Super Alien Hero Buddies"" - After seeing rip-off versions of some of Ben's alien heroes, Ben seeks revenge on whoever's responsible for this.

""The Visitor"" - Xylene, an old friend of Max's, thinks the true owner of the Omnitrix is Max himself.  Now Ben must set things right with a new alien hero: Upchuck !

Special features of this DVD include deleted scenes, exclusive promos, and an alien character gallery.

If you thought this show was cool, wait until you hear this !  This Spring, Cartoon Network presents an all new show: ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" !  Ben's back in action as he and Gwen tackle new adventures along with some brand-new alien heroes to boot !  You really don't want to miss this !",1205712000,5,1347,4.531120331950207

3041976,5,B000ZIZX9A,"Ben Tennyson is on summer vacation, traveling around the country with his grandfather Max and his cousin Gwen. During this vacation, Ben has become owner of a device called the Omnitrix, which he can use to turn into any one of 10 (and more) super-powered aliens. Since then, Ben's fought a lot of sinister villains, and he's saved the world several times. Still, summer's not over yet. Season 3, like Season 2, picks up where the last season leaves off. Only, this season, we go on adventures like never before. This time around, we see Team Tennyson in the distant future(as adults & older adult no less) as well as Team Tennyson heading to outer space in an attempt to save the Earth from total darkness among other things. Not only that but we find out many revelations in this seasons episodes that might change things for The Tennysons. In this season, Ben has to use his wits alot more and not just his powers to save the day. Extras, I'm afraid, are a bit less this season. There's a couple of deleted scenes, a handful of Ben 10 promos, a preview for the live-action Ben 10: Race Against Time DVD(which is excellent, btw), and a slideshow of alien designs. There's plenty of superhero action this season. Will not disappoint you in the least, I assure you. Ben 10 is awesome!",1231200000,,1284,4.562770562770563
3041977,5,B000ZIZX9A,"Ben 10 continues to grow in popularity and appeal.  This season Ben learns even more about the Omnitrix and the secrets it hides and gains a few new powers in the process.  Almost always with comical results but he also gets a chance to see himself, Gwen and Grandpa in the future and what might or might not come true for him.  Old enemies return and a few new ones surface as well.  It's a show for not only kids but others of all ages as well.  I'm sure the next season of Ben 10 will only continue to draw in more people as the word catches on about this quirky yet appealing show.",1216771200,,585,4.0964912280701755

I don't really care for the interaction between Ben 10 and his cousin but as long as you sit and discuss the appropriate behaviour it seems to be okay.  I do wish that this had a some educational value.  Three stars because I can't get my kid to stop asking for the video but not a parent favorite.",1255392000,,349,4.028985507246377

3276473,5,B000ZIZX9A,"Ben Tennyson is on summer vacation, traveling around the country with his grandfather Max and his cousin Gwen. During this vacation, Ben has become owner of a device called the Omnitrix, which he can use to turn into any one of 10 (and more) super-powered aliens. Since then, Ben's fought a lot of sinister villains, and he's saved the world several times. Still, summer's not over yet. Season 3, like Season 2, picks up where the last season leaves off. Only, this season, we go on adventures like never before. This time around, we see Team Tennyson in the distant future(as adults & older adult no less) as well as Team Tennyson heading to outer space in an attempt to save the Earth from total darkness among other things. Not only that but we find out many revelations in this seasons episodes that might change things for The Tennysons. In this season, Ben has to use his wits alot more and not just his powers to save the day. Extras, I'm afraid, are a bit less this season. There's a couple of deleted scenes, a handful of Ben 10 promos, a preview for the live-action Ben 10: Race Against Time DVD(which is excellent, btw), and a slideshow of alien designs. There's plenty of superhero action this season. Will not disappoint you in the least, I assure you. Ben 10 is awesome!",1231200000,,1284,4.562770562770563
3276474,5,B000ZIZX9A,"Ben 10 continues to grow in popularity and appeal.  This season Ben learns even more about the Omnitrix and the secrets it hides and gains a few new powers in the process.  Almost always with comical results but he also gets a chance to see himself, Gwen and Grandpa in the future and what might or might not come true for him.  Old enemies return and a few new ones surface as well.  It's a show for not only kids but others of all ages as well.  I'm sure the next season of Ben 10 will only continue to draw in more people as the word catches on about this quirky yet appealing show.",1216771200,,585,4.0964912280701755
