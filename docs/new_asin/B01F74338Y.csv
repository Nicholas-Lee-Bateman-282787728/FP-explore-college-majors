7749377,5,B01F74338Y,"One of the more interesting aspects of this film dealt with the modern Presidents rather ironic relationship with the White House.  Ironic, in the sense, that, as hard as they worked to become the White House's chief occupant for four to eight years, many of the Presidents actually felt trapped by it and were often eager to escape it.  Harry Truman called the White House ""the Great White Jail.""  In a letter to his daughter he wrote that it popped and creaked all night long and he could envision the ghosts of Andrew Jackson or Abraham Lincoln returning to walk the halls.  For what reason he knew not, as he considered it to be a prison, even if it was a damned nice prison.  Bill Clinton called the WH the ""crown jewel of the federal penal system.""  And Obama considered it to be too insular, as well, referring to it as ""the bubble.""",1468800000,7,840,4.457516339869281

7749379,5,B01F74338Y,"The White House Inside Story is excellent.
I got the White House DVD because my

7749385,2,B01F74338Y,"A better title for this might have been ""The White House, a Democratic President's Story."" This is a PBS related product, nicely produced with plenty of behind the scenes info. It's production was likely inspired by Obama's tenure, just like TV shows and movies celebrating the presidency so often do during Democratic administrations. Unfortunately, being a PBS product,  be prepared to be inundated with Democrat images and segments, especially Obama, Kennedy, Carter and Johnson. I saw a few fleeting images of Reagan, but not one reference to him! But plenty of attention  given to Michelle Obama's healthy food campaign. Sadly the bias is to be expected, they just can't help themselves.",1483660800,7,692,5.225225225225225

7749388,5,B01F74338Y,"Amazing documentary and wonderful insight on the history of our nations home of our Presidents. Great to see the different presidents lives and how they fit into, and respected the White House and how they dealt with the power they held living in this historic place. I cringe at the thought of the incoming President of the 2016 election entering those historic halls, with heavy heart I've the feeling that many of the staff shown in this film that currently work there and have for decades, may possibly choose to not carry out their duties any longer and move on and not to serve after President Obama ends his 8 year Presidency.",1479513600,4,633,4.660714285714286

8760430,5,B01F74338Y,"The documentary about the White House is excellent.  I would recommending this video to high school and college students.

I visited the White House twice in my lifetime.  In 1983 and 1989.  Those were great experiences and a fun tour for me.

During President Bush Sr.'s administration, I attended his birthday dinner party at the convention center in Washington, DC.  WWI veteran invited me there because my first semester grades of college were outstanding.",1530662400,,460,5.148648648648648

8760433,5,B01F74338Y,"Man, the weirdness of ratings/raters! Whatever; this video is a non-political view into an American symbol we, now in our mid-60's, hadn't entertained in prior years. It offers a lot of history even school kids might remember better than through other videos. And considering today's acidic political climate, the White House might be the only thing that leaves us understanding we have a lot of stuff about which to reflect in re our many-times-crooked American history that we have yet to resolve. Very worth watching; well done!",1518393600,,531,5.114942528735632
