3790692,5,B001TIGFEC,"I know of no other book ever written which so accurately covers this most significant subject, so completely, without resorting to fiction.  The authors compiled dozens, if not hundreds, of firsthand accounts of the actual players on both sides of this historic struggle.  This exceeds the work of ""Exodus"" in that NO fiction is used. As we all know, Truth is Stranger, and when it comes to this subject, that is an understatement.  The authors did an absolutely historic job.  The book limits its scope to the single period between the time of the UN vote to end the mandate, Nov. 1947, the declaration of the Modern Jewish State, and the initial war of Independence which determined its survival, up until the first UN truce. This book should be required reading by every person personally touched by the Middle East Conflict.  That is, just about everyone. I only wish I had known a lot sooner this books existence.  I would have read it years ago. P.S. Regarding the film that was done; there is no connection to the book other than the fictional movie was based upon the same period of time.  Since the film was totally fiction, it could have easily been concocted without tainting the fantastic work of the two authors.",1276646400,11,1225,4.723004694835681

3790695,4,B001TIGFEC,"This is an accurate portrayel of the book O'Jerusalem by Dominique LaPierre and Larry Collins. Although the film techniques are updated the story is historically accurate. A beautiful film. One to be enjoyed as ""Exodus"" by Leon Uris is.",1256688000,2,236,5.076923076923077
3790696,2,B001TIGFEC,"I thought that while the story was very compelling, the acting was pretty average at best, and awkward at times.  It seemed more like a cheap, made for TV movie.  I really expected to like it more than I did but just didn't find it very engaging.",1255910400,11,246,4.212765957446808
3790697,2,B001TIGFEC,Poor acting. Kitchy weak screen play and direction. What a shame for the perfect subject of a heroic historical event with a moral message.,1244246400,3,139,4.833333333333333
3790698,4,B001TIGFEC,"The DVD ""O Jerusalem"" was somewhat thrilling in the presentation of the drama of the diverse ethnic backgrounds being placed in the cauldron of intransigence in the midst of the evolution of modern Israel. Having also read the book of the same title, I can imagine the unsettling feelings of both sides. What was then the  catastrophe of human hatred,  was then after left unmended with both the characters suffering the death of loved ones. This is still sad as the unfolding episode as we see it still outworks itself  far beyond numerous handshakes on the white house lawn and more people of ill will wanting to continue the hatred and violence. When will Jerusalem be more than a vision of peace and become a reality? This is the question posed.",1243641600,8,749,4.702290076335878
3790699,5,B001TIGFEC,"This film is a well-casted adaptation of the novel of the same name. Although not a thorough as the novel, it nevertheless depicts that dangerous time at the end of the British rule of Palestine and the beginning of the Jewish State of Israel through the eyes of a Palestinian and an American Jew.  There are various levels of each society that we meet before the division becomes too deep.

JJ Feild stands out in a fine cast as the American Jew returning home from WWII. I recommend reading the novel and viewing this film. Several books on the subject would be ""Exodus"" by Leon Uris and The Lemon Tree (which tells both stories will equality and is true.).",1403827200,2,659,4.529411764705882
3790700,2,B001TIGFEC,"The beauty of the book was it's readability and detail, and, without fanfare, making it obvious that there were times when 2 states could have been achieved.

The movie gives nothing of this.  A fictional backcloth that wasn't in the book adds nothing to the film, except a touch of unnecessary schmaltz.  Somehow the producer's turned an exciting gripping story into schlock.

Hollywood, or whoever, at their worst.  Don't waste your time watching it, read the book.",1391731200,8,467,5.012987012987013

3790702,5,B001TIGFEC,"This is the greatest background story ever written of the founding of the Nation of Israel in 1948!  I love it!  Very interesting, it tells the story from both sides!  Amazing!",1356825600,,176,4.612903225806452
3790703,1,B001TIGFEC,"I agree with Jack Wasson below - it's too bad the film-makers used the title of the truly excellent Collins-LaPierre book because this movie is just sub-par.  The sound editor doesn't seem to understand how to make words clear so in the many scenes where groups of people are gathered what they are saying is almost incomprehensible.  The director has no idea how to move the movie along because there is no sense of pace.  In fact, it is clunky, awkward and amateurish.

Glad that I borrowed this from the library at no cost.  Not worth watching.",1356566400,4,547,4.597938144329897
3790704,4,B001TIGFEC,"This flick puts a face on the whole conflict that will not go away.  Watching this after a trip to the Old City in Jerusalem, seeing this place holy to three great religions in the world, made me want to explore more, learn more history.

Attended a BBQ of middle eastern folk last week.  For two hours we spoke, told stories, tried to learn from each other.  My new friends there own property, have relatives there.

I'd recommend this.  In many ways its a love story, a story about friendships and history and what one is willing to put on the line for what one believes.  I plan to watch it again, to read more on the future and the past of the Holy Land.",1338940800,,658,4.216

3790706,5,B001TIGFEC,"How do you explain and justify the right of the Jewish people to reclaim the ancient homeland that was taken from them by force by the Roman Empire?  The movie O Jerusalem does a pretty good job. The music

3790708,1,B001TIGFEC,"First let me state that the potential of making a good movie out of the material should have been a given.  However, the directing, acting and story line were terrible.  I could hardly finish watching the movie.  Save your money - there are much better movies out there covering Israel.",1290816000,5,286,4.68

8341544,3,B001TIGFEC,"I would give this 2 1/2 stars, not quite 3. It's a film that has great actors, performances and production. But it lacks a compelling narrative that sustains 101 minutes. I sadly never felt attached to any of the characters which frustrated me because I saw such emotional and compelling performances yet was not moved. It never was obvious what the film's goal was - other than to just document a chapter of Jerusalem's modern history. Or was it about friendship? Or was it about love? To enjoy and feel the emotional moments the film obviously was going for, I needed to understand the story those emotions were coloring in. The production was very good, however. There were several times where forgot this film was made in 2006. It had the style, feel and texture of a film made in the 50's or 60's which deepened its quality as a period film. I really enjoyed that. On the very down side, the sound was extremely uneven. I had to change the volume multiple times because I couldn't hear dialogue and then a bomb exploding made my walls rattle. In short, I'd say this film is not weaker than the sum of its parts. I hate to give it as many as 3, hate to give it as little as 2. If you buy it, enjoy the performances and production but don't expect to come away from it moved or transformed by the storytelling.",1432425600,,1313,4.407407407407407
