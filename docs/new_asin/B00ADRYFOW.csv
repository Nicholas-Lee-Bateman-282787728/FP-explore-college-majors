5410025,5,B00ADRYFOW,"I wanted to see this movie because of Werner Klemperer's part in it. He did it so well that you just want to strangle him as Eichmann. Seriously, if Eichmann were alive today you just want to kill the **** (insert appropriate insult here).Not a must see movie if you're not a fan of Klemperer's or any other actor in this movie (John Banner having a small part in it as well), and I suppose there are better movies concerning the Holocaust en the hunting of nazi's post WWII (Judgement at Nuremberg being a far more impressive movie). However, seeing it for how it was intended (a quick Hollywood summary concerning the actual hunting and capturing of Eichmannas it was actually happening around that time) it's a perfectly fine movie. The storyline doesn't always resemble the actual facts since some of those hadn't happened yet. Must see for all Klemperer fans. Movie quality was good, I was able to view the disc from my laptop.

5410026,4,B00ADRYFOW,"PLOT: Eichmann and his killing methods and the hunt to get justice for his crimes.

Warner Klemperer is very good as Adolph Eichmann the Nazi who excels at his ""job"" of killing Jews and ""hiding the crime"". The first half hour is Eichmann helping with the final solution (killing the masses of Jews) and how to do it. He makes it a business and often speculates how ""humane"" he is at his job. HIs lack of emotion for his victims and his pride and eagerness for his ""job"" makes this at times very creepy. But Warner is good at making us hate him from the first. This version of the Eichmann story is different that the focus here is his ""life"" and hiding. Other versions are his discovery and capture. Ruta Lee is his mistress Anna who we see dollar signs in her affectionate eyes at ever turn. LOL and John Banner who was later Sergeant Shultz ""I know nothing nothing nothing"" on Hogan's heroes 4 years later has a ""bit part"" as another Nazi. Eichmann is in Kuwait and moves to South America and also has other Nazi turn against him due to his arrogance and attitude. Donald Buka is David the young JEWISH child who seeks his revenge by helping hunt down the MONSTER Eichmann who gassed his parents. Some of the sets are very cheesy but effective. This is a better than expected movie as the first half hour or so give us the Nazi Eichmann and his history inside Nazi Germany and then his LIFE after the end of the war. I give it 4 stars for Klemperer's eerie performance as the evil Eichmann and better than average plot. Ruta Lee as the GREEDY mistress Anna is also a ""scene stealer"" as her greed is both fun and sad.",1371600000,2,1618,4.33993399339934
5410027,4,B00ADRYFOW,"""Operation Eichmann"" details the life and crimes of Adolf Eichmann, the architect of Hitler's ""Final Solution,"" which oversaw the building and operation of concentration camps and the deaths of over six million people. The film opens with an amazingly powerful and proud confession by Eichmann gleefully admitting to his role in these heinous crimes, and after the credits takes a turn back to trace how the decisions were made that led to those barbarous acts. After the fall of Germany Eichmann is seen traipsing around the globe with his mistress; as dedicated Israeli agents close in, he is pursued like a trapped animal. The culmination of the chase in Argentina proves most satisfying, and also provides an unexpectedly rapid close to the film.

The film is very well done, with excellent direction from R. G. Springsteen, and fantastic acting throughout. By far the most impressive role belongs to Werner Klemperer, who as Eichmann is powerful and palpably menacing. If your only exposure to Klemperer is reruns of ""Hogan's Heroes"" do not be fooled: he was a fine dramatic actor and this is a stunning performance. As an aside, you can also see future ""Hogan's Heroes"" star John Banner here as the commander of Auschwitz. Banner is in a small role, but acquits himself admirably as a villain. The other stars are Ruta Lee and Donald Buka, both of whom are equally strong in their roles.

The film is really a historical drama, but has the framing of a film noir mystery. Photography and camera work are excellent, and there is no way an interested viewer could fail to be moved by the film. It's not always fast paced, but presumably that was a conscious choice meant to emphasize the laborious 15 years it took to catch Eichmann and bring him to justice in 1960. While I think the content of the film is clearly worth five stars, the movie is worth a much better DVD packaging. It has no extras and the most basic menu I have ever seen (playing the movie is your only option) when this is a film that is begging for appropriate commentary and features on the crimes, pursuit, capture, and trial of Eichmann; hence my decision to give the DVD packaging four stars overall. I highly recommend ""Operation Eichmann.""",1366416000,10,2220,4.778645833333333
5410028,4,B00ADRYFOW,"The history of Eichmann is sketchy in this production, But it's well acted. Werner Klemperer and John Banner were better actors than they were given credit for in their careers.

8550224,3,B00ADRYFOW,"Pretty awful acting coupled with wrong decade clothing throughout. 1940s scenes had actresses with early 1960s hairstyles and makeup.  Plus, movie does not match later accounts of agents who captured Eichman as movie/book House on Garibaldi Street.  Pretty bad movie. But, interesting to see Col Klink and Sargent Schultz in very different Nazi roles from Hogan's Heros.",1455580800,,370,5.473684210526316
