663166,5,6303487629,"This is by far the best Transgender related movie I've seen to date. A wonderful light-hearted story about being who you want to be and having a little fun along the way. Adrian Pasdar does a wonderful job portraying Gerald/Geraldine who struggles with the inner turmoil of transvestism, losing his wife rather than try to explain to her what he truly doesn't understand himself. He soon befriends Julie Walters who runs a boarding house, and she is intrigued by the ""mysterious female friend"" that sneaks out of Gerald's room at night. With all the bad press Crossdressers get from talk shows and the like, it's nice to finally see a story that represents the common heterosexual transvestite. Like Geraldine, we just want someone to love and accept us for who we are.",996710400,15,769,4.833333333333333

7848557,5,6303487629,"This is a great portrayal of a heterosexual cross-dresser and his lady. It's a more realistic representation of this cross-section of humanity than the many movies portraying drag queens, most of whom seem to be gay men. It's also wonderfully entertaining, funny, and sweet, with the added twist of the main character's business challenges. This movie is based on a true story which I read many years ago.",1386028800,,405,4.970588235294118
7848558,2,6303487629,"I don't seem to find cross-dressing that funny any more, just as I don't find Abbott and
Costello, Dean and Jerry funny, I guess I've grown up.",1369958400,,143,4.333333333333333
7848559,5,6303487629,"This is an excellent movie of the Transgender life. Well made, good script, cinematography and well directed. Romantic, heartbreaking, with a happy ending. For anyone who knows or wants to know about the trials and tribulations that the Transgender goes through. It's a must see. The only exception to realism is, in real life the ending is usually not happy.",1351382400,,359,5.0
7848560,2,6303487629,"The movie, Just Like a Woman, is a typical British light romantic comedy that deals with an unusual subject.  Julie Walters is THE actress for these movies.  She starred in Personal Services, which featured prostitution and sex parties; and Calender Girls, where middle aged ladies take their clothes off for charity...

This movie deals with the issue of cross dressing (or transvestism) sympathetically and the big business subplot adds the opportunity for a feel good ending. I personally enjoyed the movie and would love to own it on DVD. But this movie never made a impression internationally and of course a Region 1 DVD release never happened.

My 2 star rating is not meant to reflect on the movie, but rather the poor DVD release. A UK region 2 DVD, the movie is presented full screen. Even my UK VHS tape of the movie is widescreen. A lack of any extras on the DVD and no decent marketing leaves you with a DVD that it seems they weren't really interested in.

I'd love to see a quality release of this DVD but it's never going to happen, the market doesn't exist.",1262390400,3,1074,4.602094240837697
7848561,4,6303487629,"This is an absolutely delightful and delicious film.  Pasdar and Walters are wonderful.  Why has someone not figured out how to make these Region 2 dvd's available to the enormous audience in the western hemisphere?????  Several of my favorite films, although available on VHS are not available in Region 1 format dvd. (hmmmph!)",1238371200,,328,5.150943396226415
7848562,1,6303487629,The DVD was in region 2 which cannot be seen on region 1 DVD-players such as those in the us and canada,1180224000,,103,3.727272727272727
7848563,4,6303487629,"It's certainly a topic that leaves a lot of people rubbing their heads trying to figure it out -- what it means about the sexuality of the people involved.  If a heterosexual woman is attracted to a cross-dressing man, is that still heterosexual?  This movie makes you question a lot of traditional categories that we put people in. The film reminds us that it's not that tidy.

The plot involves a successful investment banker (American living in London) whose wife throws him out when she comes home unexpectedly and finds all sorts of women's clothing and makeup.  It's his, only he doesn't tell her because she doesn't want to talk to him at all.  His money is tied up in the divorce, so he rents a room with a recently divorced woman who is attracted to him -- and he to her.  The other plot involves his work as an investment banker, working for a real jerk and trying to put together a deal with a Japanese company.

I know some people might shy away from the subject matter, but it's handled very well and raises some questions that are worth thinking about.  I personally recommend the movie.",1114214400,10,1101,4.525252525252525
7848564,5,6303487629,"As the reviewer before me states, this film is a must see for every transgendered person out there, especially crossdressers & those of us women who adore them. I was nearly in tears during the scene where Geraldine & Julie danced.  It is so rare to see a loving relationship between a crossdresser & genetic female portrayed on film.  This movie is absolutely wonderful.  Not only does Julie accept Geraldine, she encourages her, even when things take a turn for the worse.  And better still, this movie is based on a true story.  It is refreshingly realistic with a lighthearted humorous touch.  This is the ultimate TG/GG love story!",1036281600,6,636,4.7889908256880735
