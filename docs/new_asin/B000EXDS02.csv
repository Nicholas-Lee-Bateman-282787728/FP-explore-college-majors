2542816,5,B000EXDS02,"Mary's fourth season is the only one to feature Phyllis and Rhoda (the old guard)and Georgette and Sue Ann (the new guard) all together.  The show is really clicking on all cylinders, with many classic episodes:

THE LARS AFFAIR  Phyllis discovers Lars is having an affair with WJM's ""The Happy Homemaker.""

ANGELS IN THE SNOW  Mary dates a younger man.  She doesn't realize just HOW young until he takes her to a party...at a frat house.

RHODA'S SISTER GETS MARRIED  Rhoda and Mary fly to New York to attend the wedding of Rhoda's sister (no, it's not Brenda; it's ""Debbie,"" who is never seen or heard from again).  Brett Somers guest stars.

THE LOU AND EDIE STORY  When Edie moves out to ""find herself,"" Lou is a lost soul.

HI THERE, SPORTS FANS  Mary is saddled with the job of hiring a new sportscaster.  Dick Gautier and Gordon Jump guest star.

FATHER'S DAY  Ted meets the father who deserted the family when Ted was a baby.

SON OF ""BUT SERIOUSLY, FOLKS""  Mary's old flame Wes comes back to work at WJM in this sequel to a third season episode in which Wes tried to become a stand-up comic.  Jerry Van Dyke guest stars.

LOU'S FIRST DATE  Now that he's separated, Lou needs a date for an awards ceremony; Mary's the lucky matchmaker.

LOVE BLOOMS AT HEMPLE'S  Rhoda falls in love with her boss.

THE DINNER PARTY  One of Mary's typical dinner parties (this one for a congresswoman) wherein everything that can go wrong does.

JUST FRIENDS  Lou wants Edie to come back to him, and asks Mary to make it happen.

WE WANT BAXTER  Phyllis convinces Ted he has a future in politics, and he quits WJM in order to pursue a career in government.

I GAVE AT THE OFFICE  Murray persuades Mary to hire his daughter Bonnie, who is (of course) a complete washout.  Bruce Boxleitner guest stars.

ALMOST A NUN'S STORY  Georgette decides to become a nun after discovering Ted fooling around with another woman.

HAPPY BIRTHDAY, LOU!  Mary throws Lou a surprise party for his 50th birthday...but she's the one who winds up with a surprise.

WJM TRIES HARDER  Mary suffers from an inferiority complex when she dates a man who works on Minneapolis's top news show.

COTTAGE FOR SALE  Phyllis has become a realtor and tries to persuade Lou to sell his house.

THE CO-PRODUCERS  Mary and Rhoda are thrilled when they are given the opportunity to produce a TV show for WJM...until they find out the co-hosts are to be Ted and Sue Ann.

BEST OF ENEMIES  Mary and Rhoda are on the outs after Rhoda blabs a secret that Mary never wanted told.

BETTER LATE...THAT'S A PUN...THAN NEVER  Mary gets in a silly mood and writes a funny obituary for WJM's file.  Nobody's laughing when that person dies the next day and the jocular obit is read on the air.

TED BAXTER MEETS WALTER CRONKITE  Ted's dreams come true when Walter Cronkite visits WJM.

LOU'S SECOND DATE  Lou and Rhoda go out a few times for fun, and everyone begins to suspect it's serious.

TWO WRONGS DON'T MAKE A WRITER  Mary and Ted both attend a night school creative writing course, and have a major falling out when Ted plagiarizes Mary's assignment.

I WAS A SINGLE FOR WJM  Mary does a news story about singles bars, but nobody is willing to be interviewed on camera.",1142294400,137,3218,4.5411558669001755

2542946,4,B000EXDS02,"The show itself gets 5 stars and then some, it is so good.  But one of the greatest and most successful shows in the history of TV should get better treatment than this particular series of DVDs receives.  It is very cheaply put out there with no particular care to the quality of the entertainment.  To begin with, it is highly frustrating that there is NO option for continuous play on any of this series DVDs!!  Every time you want to watch the next episode you have to sort through several lists to get the option to play the next available episode.  Try going through these steps with late-night insomnia!  Next, there is no brief synopsis of episodes as there usually is on such videos--as if we're supposed to know which episode it is by merely the title.  So know that if you are looking for particular episodes, you'd better know the title of it or watch every one to find out which it is.  Lastly, as with all of this series, there is a HUGE tendency for ""skips"" throughout. (Video simply stops, and there are no apparent scratches to it, and other DVDs play well in my player, so I know its the DVD)  I love this series so much, I feel I have to overlook it because the alternative is to not see it at all!  Fortunately, Amazon is great to work with-they exchanged this item for me TWICE, the skips made it so unwatchable.  But the third times the charm, this one appears to play well.  But really, you would think that MTM, or whoever owns the rights to this series, would have ensured that such basic issues would have been ironed out before release because it is horribly frustrating to have to maneuver your way through a series of menus simply to play the next item on the DVD.",1416096000,7,1693,4.373801916932908

My opinion of this season, while well written and acted, is that Season 4 Mary has a much more strident voice and her attitude reflects the angry feminism of that era. . Her wardrobe by Nolan Miller is just dreadful....yes I am shallow enough to watch some of these old tv shows for the costume and set designs. Season 1 had Mary in darling outfits by Evan Picone. And where is adorable little Bess?",1373932800,,514,4.202020202020202

2542990,5,B000EXDS02,"The news today from WJM and around the world is that we may have found a cure for a stressful day & general anxiety; it's called laughing and smiling.  Take two or more episodes of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" and get merry with Mary.

Re-watching season four was like visiting with old friends and family.  That's what the show had become by the 1973/74 season.  MTM and the gang, along with the writers, were cooking with gas.  And so was the Happy Homemaker; the introduction of Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White) as host of the Happy Homemaker was as smooth as silk.  It was as if she had been there all along.  She was a great antagonist for Mary & the folks at the WJM newsroom, as well as Mary's friend, Phyllis.

This season is fantastic episode one after another:  ""Son of `But Seriously, Folks'"" is where Jerry Van Dyke returns as the drunkenly smitten boyfriend of Mary's, ""Lou's First Date"" features a hilarious dating mix-up, ""The Dinner Party"" is a classic featuring one of Mary's bad parties & the infamous Veal Prince Orloff, ""Happy Birthday, Lou!"" is another hilarious party that doesn't go well with Mr. Grant leaving his guests waiting in a hallway, ""Better Late...That's A Pun...Than Never"" sees Mary in trouble at work when she and Rhoda get goofy with some obituaries, ""Two Wrongs Don't Make a Writer"" has Mary and Ted in a writing class together with Ted re-writing Mary's history in one of the funniest scenes ever.  ""I Was a Single for WJM"" has Mary, Lou and Murray doing a piece on a singles bar.  And there are many more great ones.

The DVD quality of all 24 episodes is great.  There aren't any extras, but they already put so many in the seasons one and two releases.

The news for today?  Season four is a must-have.  As Mary would say, ""It's terrific!""  Good night and good news.",1332720000,,1804,4.518518518518518
2542991,5,B000EXDS02,This bought me back to my childhood.  As a buyer of old TV shows this one is made the way I like it with scene choices.  Meaning you can go to a particular scene.  If you love MTM please get this DVD.,1330646400,,200,3.7142857142857144

I was only little when this show was on originally but I always liked it even then. This season has been the first season I've bought on DVD, and I am very glad I did. I knew I wanted a season Betty White was in, and I believe this was the first season she appeared as Sue Ann Nivens. The cast in general was just terrific, as probably many reviewers have also said, and the writing was great.

Be patient: most TV shows will eventually be released on DVD. Right now, the studios (like Fox, Universal, etc.) are caught up in the Blue-Ray / HD format wars. They are desperately trying to feed their bottom lines with new movie releases of previous DVD releases, but in these new formats.  Neither format is likely to survive. Further, in a very short time period, all movies will be readily and cheaply available for download on the Internet. The destruction that the CD music industry saw is within years of happening to the DVD, or any movie-on-disk, industry.

TV shows are different, especially older shows. People want to own the physical copy. A season of shows is too cumbersome to deal with unless it is organized as a complete unit and the ability to select a particular episode at whim is highly valued. In fact, TV shows are becoming a more important part of the DVD production agenda. You can see the stream of new releases every month. The studios will reach deeper and deeper into their vaults of TV shows, particularly as movie demand begins to dwindle.",1194652800,6,1281,4.684444444444445

Oprah is a HUGE fan of the Mary Tyler Show and has said on previous shows how much of an inspiration the show and Mary was to her when she started off in the News business in the seventies.

I thought if we let Oprah know what was happening with FOX and this delay that maybe she could do something to help the frustrated fans out there. Perhaps have a ""Mary Appreciation"" show and fill the audience with fans of the show, maybe bring Mary and the rest of the cast on, have them reminisce about the show and use that show as an opportunity to implore FOX to stop being ridiculous and release the remaining episodes, maybe even sign a petition by audience members and send it to FOX.

It might all sound crazy, but I love this show, and we the fans deserve to have the remaining seasons released!!!! I'm sure Mary Tyler Moore herself would be frustrated if she knew how much her fans were behind the show.

One wonders why Lou keeps him on when he's so annoying, and his news broadcasts are so awful.  Doesn't make sense to the character of Lou.

If you can stand most of the shows being around Ted and his goofy girl friend, Georgette, the 4th season is good, but not as good as the earlier ones.  As for me, I would have enjoyed Ted falling in love with a girl who treated him like Lou did.  By now, Mary should have let him have it as well, but she continues to be Miss goody two shoes.  Without Lou, Rhoda and Phyllis, Mary would have fallen flat on her face.  In fact Rhoda and Phyllis steal every scene they are in with Mary.  The addition of Betty White helps, but not much of her on Season 4.  I wonder what happened to Season 5, 6, and 7.

This reminds me of the Andy Griffith Show, who comes across as a fair-minded and intelligent sheriff, who puts up with a loud mouth nut like Barney.  Barney is funny, now question about it, and the show wouldn't have been the same without him, but as a deputy he's utterly stupid and totally unbelievable.  One wonders why Andy doesn't seem to mind that he lets prisoners out of jail every chance he gets and even covers up for all his stupid mistakes.

MTM shows are still good. and if more ever come out, I will buy them, but I will be sorry to see Rhoda go, so little of Phyllis, and so much of Ted.  Sometimes I just fast forward Ted.",1167868800,5,1587,4.1237785016286646
2543100,5,B000EXDS02,"I can't imagine any smart, funny person who doesn't like The Mary Tyler Moore Show. This fourth season package is particularly appealing, however, because the show really started to hit its stride. The writing, directing and exceptional ensemble cast all jelled in this fourth season (not unlike Seinfeld's fourth season).

But what is most notable about the fourth season is the introduction of the inimitable Sue Ann Nivens, played by the only actor who could give her manical, sex-starved character her due -- Betty White.

I greatly look forward to when the fifth season is released, as Betty White's Sue Ann continues on her rampage and the rest of the cast continues to shine as well. There's a particularly funny episode in the fifth season when Sue Ann tries out for a news commentator spot on WJM's newscast. I know everyone says the ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"" episode is the funniest, but the one where Sue Ann tries out for WJM's ""News Hen"" gets my first-place vote, hands-down.

2543104,5,B000EXDS02,"Although the show ran throughout the '70s, its appeal is still lasting today, in the story of Mary Richards and her eclectic co-workers in the WJM newsroom...

In the pilot, 30-year-old Mary has just moved to Minneapolis, eager to start a new life as a single careerwoman after her breakup with her fiance. She answers an ad seeking a secretary, and finds herself associate producer of the six o'clock news at WJM. There, she works for Lou Grant, a tough guy with a soft exterior and a ready bottle of booze, and alongside kindhearted news writer Murray and self-centered, idiotic reporter Ted Baxter.

On the home front, Mary decides to rent an apartment in the home of her college friend Phyllis Lindstrom...incurring the wrath of New York native Rhoda Morgenstern, who had her heart set on moving in. Despite their rocky start, the two opposite personalities quickly become best friends, creating the basis for much of the show's humor.

In Season 4, plots center upon - as always - Mary's miscellaneous dating adventures; the break-up of Lou's marriage; and Rhoda's decision to move back to New York. Betty White also begins her role as Sue Ann Nivens, the ""Happy Homemaker.""

If you've never seen this show, I urge you to give it a try! You'll soon be looking for the rest of the seasons.",1164844800,2,1293,4.758928571428571
2543105,5,B000EXDS02,"This is the best season DVD release of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" so far and sees the last regular appearance of Valerie Harper's Rhoda(who spinoffs to the equally successful ""Rhoda"")and the first appearance of the very funny Betty White as the man hungry,""Happy Homemaker"" Sue-Ann Nivens.

Sue-Ann debuts in the first episode of the season ""The Lars Affair"",one of the best MTMS episodes,as Sue-Ann embarks on an affair with Phyllis'husband,the unseen Lars and earned Betty White a regular spot on the show and Chloris Leachman an Emmy,for her venomous performance as the wronged Phyllis.

Chloris Leachman was indeed in such demand at this point,her appearances on the show went down to just three episodes per season until she too got a spinoff ""Phyllis"" but although very funny at times,the character of Phyllis seemed watered down compared to her time on MTMS.

Ted Knight is hilarious in very scene he appears in,in the episode ""Two Wrongs Don't Make A Writer"",he steals Mary's idea,in their writing class and gets a very public telling off from Mary,when her turn to speak comes.

As always with MTMS,there are real hearfelt moments too,in the classic ""The Lou and Edie Story"",Lou and his wife Edie separate and in the middle of a really tense moment,Lou rabbits on about oranges,the acting and writing is first rate,no wonder the episode won an Emmy.

We also get a dry run of the ""Rhoda"" pilot in ""Rhoda's Sister Gets Married"" with the great Nancy Walker as Ida and a sister Debbie,who never appears again,we all preferred Brenda though,before Julie Kavner found even more fame as the voice of Marge Simpson.

Gavin MacLeod as Murray is always a funny,whitty presence but doesn't really get any major episode to himself but his putdowns to Ted are a joy.

Mary Tyler Moore herself,is always on top form,in the episode ""Best Of Enemies"",Mary and Rhoda fall out after Rhoda blurts out that Mary never finished college and lied on her application for the news job,you really feel Mary's anguish over the fallout and in ""Angels In The Snow"",the scene where Mary goes to a young person's shop to buy ""youngish"" clothes,as she's dating a man eight years her junior,is a classic.

Another joyish episode is ""Happy Birthday Lou"" when Mary throws a surprise birthday for Lou and the grumpy Lou doesn't let the guests in,as Rhoda says ""Mary,I think we've found a theme for this party,hatred!""

All in all,this DVD set is a sheer joy and is 24 episodes in a masterclass,in how to do a great sitcom.",1164758400,2,2497,4.856470588235294

2543139,5,B000EXDS02,"Back in the late `70s and early `80s, an afternoon highlight was catching an hour of great shows that had just recently come into syndication:  The Mary Tyler Moore Show and The Bob Newhart Show.  I may have been too young to really catch them in their first runs, but it was a delight to see them when I did.  Unlike many hit comedies of yesteryear, these shows (outside of the clothes) do not show their age even now; they are still brilliantly funny in a way that many shows today can only aspire to.

The Mary Tyler Moore Show dealt with the adventures of Mary Richards, a single, thirty-ish woman living in Minneapolis.  At home, she spent a lot of time with her neighbor and best friend, Rhoda Morgenstern.  She worked at WJM as associate producer of the news.  In this office, the head writer was Murray Slaughter, the producer was Lou Grant and the anchorman was Ted Baxter.  Baxter, played by Ted Knight, often steals the show:  Vain, dumb and cheap, Ted nonetheless is endearing, especially when his faade cracks.  But all the characters have their own, distinct personalities and they mix together almost perfectly.

The fourth season really demonstrates how the show has gone well beyond Mary, who often isn't even the prinicipal character.  The opening episode illustrates this:  Mary's landlady Phyllis finds her husband having an affair with Sue Ann Nivens.  (For those only familiar with Betty White as the blissful airhead in Golden Girls and later shows, this role shows a completely different side of her.)  Mary is more of an observer than an actual participant.

Throughout the season, other characters also take the spotlight:  an ongoing story arc deals with Lou's separation from his wife, Edie.  Ted pursues awards and meets his long lost father, Rhoda dates her boss (and Lou!); Phyllis becomes a real estate agent.  In fact, of the 24 episodes in the set, just a little more than half have Mary as the central character.  For that matter, little occurs on the romantic front for her; after one episode with a much younger man, she spends most of the rest of the season casually dating the station sportscaster (who is only briefly in a few episodes).

In sum, this show is as good now as ever.  What's really nice is each episode is only twenty-five minutes long, so you can squeeze them when you need a quick break from the rest of the world.  If you want to see how good TV comedy can be, this is a show well worth watching.",1161388800,9,2453,4.640371229698376

2543141,5,B000EXDS02,"Having been born in 1982, I came very close to missing out on the exquisite ""Mary Tyler Moore Show"". Luckily, my stepfather purchased the season one DVD and introduced me to the show. I instantly fell in love with it; the set-up is by now familiar thanks to all of the shows that have copied the format, but all imitators pale in comparison to the master. The writing is intelligent and genuinely funny, the characters are interesting and involving, and the cast is pitch-perfect. I immediately grabbed seasons two, three and four when they became available, and what really strikes me is that, rather than deteriorate with age, each season just gets better and better. The fourth season is the best yet with the introduction of Sue Ann Nivens -- the devilish Happy Homemaker who livens things up with her outwardly sweet, inwardly nasty demeanor (as played by the inimitable Betty White). More than thirty years later ""Mary"" is still the best television out there -- and is surprisingly fresh despite its age.",1156809600,10,1010,4.84393063583815

Rhoda (Valerie Harper) remains my favorite supporting character, but Lou Grant (Ed Asner) and Ted Baxter (Ted Knight) are close behind. It goes without saying that Mary Tyler Moore is stellar throughout. She's still cute in that pushover kind of way, but there's a little more bite and steel. Plus you really do want her to be your best friend! I watched all 24 season 4 episodes in a row night after night obsessively. The performances are outstanding and the cast really gels, but it surely comes down to the writing. This show had smarts, class, diverse characters and relatable situations. Standouts for me include ""The Lars Affair"", ""The Lou and Edie Story"", ""The Dinner Party"" (an ep I remembered immediately upon seeing again), ""Happy Birthday, Lou!"", ""Best of Enemies"" and MTM at her best in ""Better Late...That's A Pun...Than Never"".

2543159,5,B000EXDS02,"The set up is familiar by now.  Mary Richards (Mary Tyler Moore) works at WJM news in Minneapolis.  Despite the efforts of the crew, including news writer Murray (Gavin MacLeod) and producer Lou Grant (Ed Asner), the show is constantly last in the ratings, thanks in large part to bumbling anchor Ted Baxter (Ted Knight).  On the home front, Mary lives in a building with her best friends Rhoda (Valerie Harper) and Phyllis (Cloris Leachman).  Rounding out the cast are Ted's girlfriend Georgette (Georgia Engel) and WJM's answer to Martha Stewart (before she made any kind of name for herself), Sue Ann Nivens (Betty White).

Season 4 of the Mary Tyler Moore Show is my favorite of the seven seasons.  It's the last one before Rhoda leaves for her own series set in New York and the season that introduces us to Sue Ann.  That means this is the only season to feature all eight of the series main characters.  And it features some of the best laughs of the show.

While Mary has given some bad parties before, this is the first season to really play up her ability to give a lousy party.  It starts right out with the first episode, ""The Lars Affair,"" when Phyllis' husband hooks up with Sue Ann.  In my opinion, the best of these bad parties are on disc two.  Mary must give ""The Dinner Party"" when a congresswoman accepts her invitation to dinner.  She talks Sue Ann into cooking, only to have too many people show up for the actual event.  Then, in ""Happy Birthday, Lou!"" she decides to give a surprise party for her boss, only to discover he hates birthdays and surprises.

Another standout episode is ""The Co-Producers.""  Mary and Rhoda are given the green light to work on a Sunday afternoon talk show.  The catch is they must use egotistical Ted and Sue Ann as the co-hosts.  Georgette's final line in this one is classic.

Speaking of Georgette, she gets a chance to shine in ""Almost a Nun's Story.""  After seeing Ted kissing another woman, she decides to join a convent.  The final scene is hilarious and shows she is much smarter then she normally appears.

""Better Late...That's a Pun...Than Never"" is another classic.  A tired Mary writes a flip obituary, only to have it read on the air the next night.

And I can't forget ""Ted Baxter Meets Walter Cronkite.""  After finally winning a local award, Ted thinks that his idol has come to offer him a network job.

The show takes on some serious topics in this season as well.  Most noticeably, Lou's wife leaves him and files for divorce.  This is the first real story arc of the series, and plays out over several episodes, starting with ""The Lou and Edie Story"" in disc one.  Some, like that one, are more somber.  Some play up the comedy, such as Mary finding Lou a date old enough to be his mother in ""Lou's First Date.""

The writing has really gelled here, and all the returning characters are at their best.  Sue Ann, intended to be a one episode guest star, is still developing.  She isn't quite as snide as she is in later seasons, but her basic overbearing personality is in place.

The actors do a great job as well.  They know their characters, take the great work by the writers, and make it shine.  The result is a show that is hilarious and touching about a group of people we really come to care about.  This season also features an impressive list of guest stars, including Brett Somers and a before they were famous Henry Winkler (Fonzie on ""Happy Days"") and Bruce Boxleitner of ""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" and ""Babylon 5.""

This set is just like the season three set.  Unfortunately, that means no extras.  Fortunately, that means the picture is sharp and the mono sound track is clear.

While there are still classic episodes of this sit-com to come, I've always felt the show looses something once Rhoda leaves.  Therefore, I treasure this season when any character can walk into an episode at any time.  It's wonderfully funny.  Any fan of the show will love this set.",1154476800,13,3947,4.561253561253562

I could even forgive the complete lack of any extras if they AT LEAST used the original masters to produce the DVDs. The series is frankly too good to miss.

2543162,5,B000EXDS02,"It just gets better and better.  By season four this series was in its groove, the characters playing so well off each other that it was a shame to see the cast broken up when Rhoda started her own show.  Phyllis had pretty much gone her own way by this point, lending a handful of appearances. Betty White is ushered into the show when she tries to woo away Phyllis' husband, Lars, and we see the reprise of Georgette as Ted's love interest.  Lots of great cameos like Peter Strauss as one of Mary's younger boyfried and Dick Gautier as a smarmy sportscaster which Mary is forced to let go.  There are many poignant moments as well, such as when Lou and Edie break up, setting up one of the more memorable shows when Mary unwittingly sets up Lou with an elder blind date.  The repartee is so good, as seen when Ted pretends to lose his voice and is forced to pantomime in front of Lou, rather than confront a father he had never known.  Not one episode seems out of place.  This was situation comedy at its best.  Not that there haven't been plenty of good shows since then, but the Mary Tyler Moore Show set the gold standard.",1151884800,3,1128,4.312796208530806
2543163,4,B000EXDS02,"Content -- the series is clearly peaking, the characters have matured, the writing is gelling. Take note of how Betty White proceeds over five episodes. She's not fully yet the Sue Ann we came to know -- Murray is not yet a foil, and Mary's not yet a victim of her snide putdowns.

But no extras? None? (Same with Season 3). That's just shoddy. And, apart from the musical edits (as explained above), are these really the full-length original (non-syndicated) episodes? I honestly don't know (and the packaging doesn't bother to say.)

Packaging quirks:  The cast photo on the back cover is obviously not from Season 4, and neither from Season 4 is one of two inset photos (the one with Sue Ann talking to Mary & Murray)

Still worth every penny for everything in ""The Lars Affair,"" for Martin's and Ida's reaction to Aunt Rose, for Mary's reaction to Andy Rivers' first sportscast, for Mary's displaying the veal prince Orloff to Henry Winkler at ""the little table,"" for Georgette's supplying the last line to ""On the Good Ship Lollipop,"" ""So, whaddaya say now we bring Rhoda in, You like Rhoda,"" ""Wee Willie Williams' obituary,"" ""You're like Pittsburgh,"" ""Nice to meet you.

2543164,5,B000EXDS02,"Season 4 of MTM shows the 70's in full swing; Mary has bangs and a more natural hairstyle (no more falls like in Season 1) and no longer only wears skirts and dresses to work. Yes, for better or worse, this is the dawn of the wide-legged pantsuit.  Can Mary pull it off?  Of course she can!

Mary has redecorated her apartment and everything is beige, beige, beige; this could just be the camera filter but what a relief when the action switches to Rhoda's colorful digs upstairs.  Sadly, this is also Valerie Harper's last season on MTM as Rhoda will have her eponymously-titled show the following season.

There are less establishing shots of the house Mary and Rhoda live in because it's obviously a different, and less charming, home. (The reason for this is explained on a documentary on the Season 2 set; the owner of the original home no longer wanted the house to be included on the show.) And the show now focuses most of its time on the workplace.  As compared to earlier seasons, there are far fewer ""Mary's romantic dilemma!"" episodes and more time is given to Ted and Lou, while Murray still patiently sits at his desk delivering one-liners.  And showing that things have come a long way, Mary spends less time at work making coffee for Lou and is a valuable asset to WJM and a competent careerwoman.

Season Four has any number of classic episodes: ""The Dinner Party"" featuring a young and very funny Henry Winkler, ""The Lars Affair"" which has a classic confrontation between Phyllis and Sue Ann and my personal favorite of the entire series, ""Two Wrongs Don't Make a Writer"" when Ted and Mary take a writing class together only to have Ted steal Mary's assignment.  To try and describe this episode any more wouldn't do it justice, but it's a comedic high point and is one of the only times Mary really loses her cool.  Another notable episode, ""Cottage for Sale"", starts off slowly but ends up a very good episode that showcases Edward Asner's Lou Grant at his vulnerable best -- and as the creator of the beer omelet.

The lack of extras is a bit disappointing, but otherwise this latest release of Mary and friends is just what we all need.  Meow.",1151366400,58,2165,4.580310880829016

2543187,5,B000EXDS02,"20th Century Fox really picked up the pace of releasing ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" in season-by-season sets on DVD, with Season #4 arriving in a great-looking 3-Disc boxed collection on June 20th, 2006 (only five months after the third-year set came out, which is also a first-rate aggregation of MTM programs).

The fourth season (which was first telecast on CBS-TV in 1973-1974) contains such TMTMS gems as ""The Lars Affair"", ""Lou's First Date"", ""Best Of Enemies"", and ""Rhoda's Sister Gets Married"", plus two of my all-time faves -- ""The Dinner Party"" (the famous ""Veal Prince Orloff"" episode with Henry Winkler putting in a funny cameo -- ""Could somebody pass the salt?"") and ""Ted Baxter Meets Walter Cronkite"".

This 4th year of the series is one of my very favorite seasons. In addition to the previously-mentioned episodes, there's also the very funny ""Happy Birthday, Lou!"", which showcases another of Mary Richards' not-too-successful parties. Mary arranges a surprise birthday party for Lou Grant, but Lou detests such things. And, naturally, some humorous scenes follow in wake of this development. ""So what do you say, we bring Rhoda in....you like Rhodaaaaa."" ~LOL~

The ""Happy Birthday"" episode also features the absolutely-hilarious scene which has weatherman Gordy (John Amos) walking in unexpectedly while Lou and his wife are doing a little flirting (""kitchy-kitchy-koo!""). ~Huge LOL!~

There's also ""I Was A Single For WJM"", another stellar Season-Four effort. The scene from the not-so-swinging singles bar is a howl, as Mary, Lou, and Murray are forced to face the camera and tell of their ""singles"" experiences at the bar. Their flustered ""live"" on-the-air reactions are always worth a replay.

And I simply can't forget about another top-drawer episode from this fourth season -- ""Better Late...That's A Pun...Than Never"" -- which is the ""funny obituary"" episode with Mary getting suspended from her job at WJM. A classic TMTMS moment arrives when Ted reads one of Mary's ""funny"" obits on the air. .... ""Wee Willie Williams is dead at 110. There were other citizens of Minneapolis who were older, however they happen to be dead."" .... ""What's Wee Willie's mom gonna say?!"" :)

----------------------

The video and audio quality for ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show: The Complete Fourth Season"" is just about on par with the three earlier DVD releases -- which means it's pretty doggone good (IMO). The video is a little ""soft"" in some scenes, and could probably be honed-in to more razor-sharp clarity at times. But, overall, I like what I see here (both Mary and the video quality). ~grin~

The opening titles for TMTMS were changed again for Season 4. The terrific Sonny Curtis theme song is still intact, but the visuals are different from the previous seasons. For a behind-the-scenes look at how this season's main title sequence was put together and filmed, pick up the Season-Two DVD boxed set of MTM. In that set there's a 21-minute-long bonus documentary called ""Moore On Sunday"", which takes the viewer behind the cameras as Mary, Valerie Harper, and the MTM Show crew go about the task of filming the fourth-season opening titles on the streets of Minneapolis in May 1973.

That ""Moore On Sunday"" bonus would have been more appropriately placed in this Season-Four DVD set, but it was put on Season 2 instead. Unfortunately, there are no bonus interviews, documentaries, or commentary tracks to be found within this fourth-year set. But a very nice batch of DVD bonus supplements can be located on each of the first two MTM sets issued by Fox Home Entertainment.

There's a ""musical edit"" or two sprinkled here and there within this Season-4 set, just like with earlier seasons of MTM on DVD, including a line that was spoken (not sung) by Murray Slaughter (Gavin MacLeod) which has been removed from the episode ""The Co-Producers"" on the DVD, due to it being a copyrighted line from a song in ""The Sound Of Music"".

Such trimming and/or changing of music-related material within the MTM shows indicates, quite obviously, that 20th Century Fox either couldn't obtain the rights to the musical material involved, or that the Fox DVD people just flat-out refused to fork over the greenbacks to secure the copyrights for the music. The latter explanation is much more likely to be the case, IMO, given the number of times this has happened within just four individual seasons of TMTMS on DVD, starting with the ""White Christmas"" edit in Season One.

It's fairly obvious to me that a huge studio like Fox COULD obtain the song rights, if they wanted to....they simply don't/didn't want to do so. So, I guess I'll just have to live with that decision. And I shall.

But, to be perfectly fair regarding this music issue, I've been hearing of late that licensing fees for almost all musical material for home-video products have gone through the roof. Evidently it can cost a studio tens of thousands of dollars to garner all the legal rights to just a single piece of music. So, if this is the case, I guess I can't blame the Fox people too much for not wanting to pay ridiculously-inflated sums of cash for just a few seconds of material. (Are people in the music industry TRULY as greedy as this would seem to indicate? If so, it's kind of a sad thing, IMO.)

However, I'm not about to let those very few minor edits/alterations to this great TV series completely dictate my purchasing decision re. these MTM sets. I'd much rather have the full, unaltered versions of every single episode (natch), but the occasional musical edits and dubs that must be endured are not nearly enough of a detriment to make me want to boycott these DVDs.

----------------------

The Season-Four DVD packaging is, IMO, the best yet in the Fox series of MTM sets. The very flattering photo of Mary used on the front cover is just perfect.

The physical structure of this 3-Disc set is identical to the Season-Two and Season-Three MTM releases, with three slim plastic cases resting inside a reasonably-thick outer cardboard carton. Each slim case holds one single-sided disc, with exactly eight episodes presented on each DVD.

Program information is located on the back of each of the plastic cases. This info includes episode titles, brief show descriptions, writing and directing credits, and original airdates. Episode running times average about 25.5 minutes per show.

The back of the outer slipcase contains three photos, including a great-looking group shot of the WJM-TV gang (plus Georgette too), although Rhoda has been left out of this cast grouping, which is too bad.

The slipcase also contains the usual specifications grid and general notations about the series. But they've made an error in the specs grid with respect to the years Season 4 was first aired -- the box says ""1972-73"". That's incorrect. It should read 1973-74.

The slim cases are black in color, instead of the transparent clear type. I, myself, have replaced the black ones with clear cases. I prefer the clear ones. Black just seems a little too depressing for a show all about perky MTM. :)

----------------------

Other Assorted DVD Particulars:

The audio sounds fine by way of the Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono soundtracks employed here (in English only). Video for these 24 color episodes is presented in its intended Full-Screen TV shape (1.33:1). Subtitles are available in both English and Spanish. And a ""Play All"" is accessible from the Main Menu on each disc.

The DVD Menus for Season Four are quiet, non-animated, and user-friendly. But the cartoon-like photos used on a few of the Menu screens take a bit of getting used to. They're okay I guess, but a little strange-looking (featuring a combination of real-life photographs mixed with drawn-in animation).

The Main Menu on each disc serves as the Episode Selection Menu as well. And, like all the earlier MTM seasons, each episode gets its own Sub-Menu, from where the viewer can select ""Play Episode"", ""Scene Selection"", or ""Language Selection"". The episodes are broken into a very generous total of 10 chapters each (which are divided up into three separate screens within the Scene Index Sub-Menu).

----------------------

To Sum It Up:

Season #4 of ""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is without doubt a great year for this Emmy-winning TV program. The number of truly ""Five Star"" episodes located within this boxed set is quite impressive, in my own opinion.

The cast, the writing, the style, the warmth, the friendships, Ted Baxter's hilarious ego, and Mary's great one-room apartment all play a part in making each episode of TMTMS what it was in the 1970s, and what it still is today (thanks to DVD collections like this one) -- 25 minutes of fun and laughter, spent with people who deserve to be cared about. And, by me, they are. :)",1151020800,12,8789,4.943012211668928
2543188,5,B000EXDS02,"Fox has done another great job on this MTM set.  The restoration work is great.  Since this is probably the finest sitcom in tv history, it's unfortunate that extras aren't included.  However, if it keeps the price point down so that we can continue to get future releases of all 7 seasons, so be it.  One request FOX, PLEASE include the final curtain call on on The Last Episode of Season 7.  This one scene aired only on its original network run in 1977 on CBS and it's a lost treasure.  The set would NOT be complete without its inclusion on Season 7.  Please!",1150934400,9,563,4.355769230769231
2543189,5,B000EXDS02,"MTM is one of the funniest, warmest, intelligent, truly classic TV shows ever. It is amazingly fresh today as it was 30 years ago and I can't think of another sitcom with the same level of cleverness, class and style.

This season won an Emmy for Mary Tyler Moore, Cloris Leachman and Treva Silverman (best writing). However, this is no indication that this season is better than the others. All seasons are excellent, and each one got a bunch of awards (MTM held the record for biggest Emmy Award winner - 29 awards - for 30 years. It took Frasier 11 years to break the record that MTM set during a 7 years run).

This show was so great that it went on to win the best comedy Emmy award for each of its last 3 seasons.

With a creative team that went on to create Taxi, Cheers, Friends and The Simpsons, and a cast that includes Mary Tyler Moore, Edward Asner, Gavin MacLeod, Valerie Harper, Ted Knight, Cloris Leachman, Georgia Engel, Nancy Walker and Betty White, how can you go wrong?",1150848000,3,988,4.417582417582418

Sure, the last 2 season releases have no extras but, considering the studio could have stopped after season one, I'm glad to have what we do have here... and that is a beautiful presentation of each episode and best of all they are complete episodes as they aired in their orginal network run NOT the syndicated versions which has happened with many other TV series DVD releases! MTM set the standard for excellence in sitcoms! This is the only series that I'm collecting each season so, keep them coming FOX! The next series I'd like to collect is ""Rhoda"" especially season one! So, how about it FOX? Release ""Rhoda"" on DVD! If that never happens we'll continue to enjoy the remaining 3 seasons of MTM on DVD! Bring on seasons 5 thru 7 so I can complete my collection! Thanks again, FOX!",1150848000,3,874,4.573248407643312
2543192,2,B000EXDS02,"Just as with the first season set, and the third season set, this new season four set of Mary Tyler Moore (perhaps the quintessential season of the series) has suffered from editing for the DVD release. Seeing this makes me ache even more that another studio, other then Fox, has not compiled this series for DVD. It was bad enough we had to wait three years for the second season to come out (after the first), but now we have the suffer the shows begin edited from their original form.

The episode, ""Angels in the Snow"" (the second one on this set, and one of my personal favorites), has a classic scene at the apartment of the guy Mary is dating. When Mary and Rhoda walk in to the apartment, the song ""Earth Angel"" is playing in the background, to which Rhoda remarks how it's the same song that played at her High School prom. Well Folks, the geniuses at Fox (probably not wanting to pay for its use on the DVD) have removed that song and replaced it with, what sounds like, some generic 70s disco track. Now the joke makes absolutely no sense, as clearly Rhoda did not go to HS in the 70s! At the very least, the song could have been replaced by a generic 50s track, but 70s??!! Come on!!

I've already been disappointed with how FOX has edited some of their other shows on DVD (such as ""In Living Color""), and made NO mention of the fact on the DVD case. Seeing a classic like MTM tampered with, like this, sickens me. This show deserves a WHOLE lot more respect then this. Just wait till further seasons are released. I can only imagine how episodes like ""Lou and That Woman"", ""I Love a Piano"" and ""Murray Can't Lose"" are going to fare when they have prominent scenes with music in them. Other shows manage to come out on DVD with their musical bits intact. It is a shame that MTM has not.

Add to this, there are no extras at all on this set. Sure it's great to have a full season of shows for $20, but who cares when they are edited and poorly packaged? I would rather spend a few dollars more to see ALL the shows uncut and with some quality extras.",1150761600,26,2061,4.265984654731458
2543193,5,B000EXDS02,"""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"" is one of the best television shows ever, and, unless memory serves me incorrectly, this was their best season.  The characters have developed even better than before, and, unlike the third season, there aren't any subdued, but well acted episodes when we ""meet the parents"".

""The Lars Affair,"" which features the debut of Sue Ann, is a classic.  The same could be said for ""The Dinner Party,"" which is so well assembled and has a fine appearance by Henry Winkler. (It shows Ted at his buffooning best and puts Mary in one of her most awkward positions.)  ""The Lou and Edie Story"" demonstrates how well they were able to mix laughs and  tenderness together.  ""Happy Birthday, Lou"" is another shining moment for our most endearing comic ensemble, but ""Two Wrongs Don't Make a Writer"" is even more memorable.  (Mary and Ted are enrolled in the same night writing class.)  ""Better Late Than Never"" has a fine plot, one that defines the office situation better and challenges some of our comfortable notions about their relationships.  One of the most celebrated episodes comes when Walter Cronkite appears at the studio and meets his unknown would-be understudy, Ted.  Surveying, the rest of the season, there isn't an average one in the bunch.  Significantly, we are sent to New York, where Rhoda's sister is getting married.  The episode heralds a spin-off.  As a watershed comes to the show, Rhoda leaves and Sue Ann appears, the best year (probably) is catalyzed.

The show is vintage television, and the price for twenty-four episodes makes it a best bet.  It is perhaps the best season from the best and most endearing characters we've come to know.",1149379200,8,1681,4.869718309859155
2543194,5,B000EXDS02,"...are there NO extras whatsoever on the fourth season?!?  No commentary by Cloris Leachman, Betty White or any of the show's writers or producers on ""The Lars Affair,"" one of the best episodes in the show's history; the one that introduced Sue Ann Nivens and earned Leachman an Emmy?  No more Emmy clips or TV spots?

Don't get me wrong; like all MTM fans, I love it that Fox is finally getting on the ball and releasing more seasons, but I also wish that the company would take at least a little care in doing so.  After all, this show still remains one of the most awarded and acclaimed in TV history.

I give five stars to the set because MTM is a great show, even if all you get are the uncut episodes themselves.  But as a fan, I'm still kinda bummed.  I only hope that seasons 5 and 6 (which, respectively, feature ""Will Mary Richards Go to Jail?"" and ""Chuckles Bites the Dust"") contain at least a little something for those of us who, as Lou says in the last episode, treasure these people.",1146096000,23,998,4.333333333333333
