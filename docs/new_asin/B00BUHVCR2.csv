8574114,4,B00BUHVCR2,"I'm reviewing the movie because it's my favorite ""samurai movie,"" but I'm a bit disappointed that it's not available on a region 1 DVD--hence the 4 star rating and not 5 stars.  It would be great if Amazon could get this for the American/Canadian market--hint, hint.

The film is probable Kurosawa's finest, and considering that it was his last, it has a kind of poetry to it that reflects the thoughtfulness of a man who has gained much in his life and experience.  If you are looking for a lot of sword play, you'll probably not like this film.  It has some sword fighting scenes that support the attitude of the main character, but if you are looking for an action film, this isn't it.  If you are looking for a thoughtful film about the humanity of a ronin samurai, his wife, and the people he encounters, I think you will like it.  I most assuredly did.",1407715200,11,858,4.43312101910828
