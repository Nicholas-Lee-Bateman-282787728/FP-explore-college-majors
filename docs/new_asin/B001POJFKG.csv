3755244,1,B001POJFKG,This video is a copy that has a very bad quality. I was very disappointed; the video is now in the trash can........don't get fooled.....,1360108800,,137,4.52
3755245,1,B001POJFKG,"THIS IS A TOTAL MISREPRESENTATION....SO DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURE ON THE COVER LEADING YOU TO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS CHERS CURRENT TOUR IN LAS VEGAS! IT IS NOT !!!!!! THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN A SELECT FEW CUTS FROM CHERS FAREWELL TOUR A FEW YEARS AGO. SHAME ON A COMPANY FOR TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OFF OF PEOPLE IN SUCH A DECEITFUL WAY!!!! I PLAN ON BOYCOTTING THIS COMPANY AND HITTING THEM RIGHT IN THEIR WALLETS. IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS THE ONLY THING MULTI MILLION DOLLAR CORPORATIONS SEEM TO UNDERSTAND!!!!! CHERS PRODUCTION COMPANY NEEDS TO BE INFORMED OF THIS. I GUARANTEE THAT SHE'D SUE THEM IN A HEARTBEAT!! I'VE BEEN AN AVID CHER FAN FOR 45 YEARS AND ONE THING I'M CERTAIN ABOUT HER IS THAT HER FANS ARE HER NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND SHE WILL ATTACK WHEN ANYONE TRIES TO ""SCREW"" WITH THEM!!!!! COME TOMORROW MORNING I THINK A PHONE CALL IS IN ORDER!!!!!",1271548800,19,861,4.421383647798742
3755246,1,B001POJFKG,"As the other review states,  all this is is the old Cher in concert in Vegas as seen on HBO.  It does lead you to believe that it is the new one.  Total ripoff.",1264032000,15,160,3.6470588235294117
3755247,1,B001POJFKG,"This decieving cover may seem like this is a DVD from Cher's current Vegas stint. The present promo pic down to the Cher logo hide the fact that this is the 1999 Cher @ MGM Believe tour. If your a Cher fan you already have this item (with a holographic cover). You can find the official HBO version on Amazon

8334056,1,B001POJFKG,"The dvd shows a combination of Farewell Tour cut/spliced into the Live in Las Vegas.  I wanted to see a full production of a vegas show.
This does not have it.  When showing the audience, you see the audience in Miami 2002/2003. Then it pans back to the vegas audience.
Definetly not a buy, unless you never have seen the Farewell Tour.  2003. You would get a combination of both.",1421798400,,380,4.4
8334057,1,B001POJFKG,"Based on most of the negative feedback, and misrepresentation of an older concert, I will not purchase this dvd. I did notice all the typos in the description, that should have given it away this is a forgery and someone should be prosecuted, or at least removed from Amazon.",1417478400,,275,4.63265306122449
