8323450,1,B001NCE3LG,Focused way too much on other people. Had most of the original 'Moonshine' footage in it. Jim Tom has maybe 20 minutes of screentime.,1471651200,,133,4.583333333333333

8323452,3,B001NCE3LG,"Disappointed this Video could have been done a whole lot better. It was like it was made as a school project from old home videos and shares to much with ""moonshine"" video",1412467200,,171,4.375

8323454,3,B001NCE3LG,Not bad for a few moments in the life of JimTom and friends and friends and friends......standard craziness you expect.,1361232000,,119,5.0
8323455,5,B001NCE3LG,This is great for people who are fans of the tv show Moonshiners and the people on it like Popcorn and Jim 'Rye Whiskey' Tom!  This is not for those that are looking for a DIY.  Hopefully all other reviews will be 5 out of 5 cuz these guys are GREAT! lol,1359936000,3,254,3.8653846153846154
8323456,1,B001NCE3LG,It is not at all what you think.. If you are trying to learn about making moonshine this movie is not for you at all.  Big waste of money,1352592000,2,137,3.7241379310344827
8323457,5,B001NCE3LG,I have watched this video so many times.  It is great.  Buy this video you will not be disappointed.  Jim Tom the main character is funny.,1333497600,5,138,4.230769230769231
8323458,5,B001NCE3LG,"This is a Great documentary! If you want an instructional manual on distilling then there are plenty of books on Amazon to do just that. Although it is somewhat slow at times, the humor that Jim Tom portrays well makes up for that.
  The people in the movie reflect the Appalacian culture which is true to the area and the soundtrack is EXCELLENT! My hats off to you Mr. Riley for a fine job!
  I'm giving this 5 stars and would recommend Popcorn Suttons DVD ""The Last Run"" to go with this.",1313107200,7,490,4.293478260869565
