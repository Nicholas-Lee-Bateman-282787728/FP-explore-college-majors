8469502,3,B005F3HXFM,"I will never understand the way Timeless Media Group slices and dices their DVD releases of all the TV shows they distribute. They are constantly releasing single disc sets of the first group of episodes, best of sets, ""collector tins"", full seasons, partial seasons......all repeating the same episodes. This release is a good example. The first three discs of this set are the first three discs of their season one release. They even have ""The Complete First Season"" emblazoned on their labels and the screen menus. The last three discs of this set are the ones previously released on their set of random episodes under the title ""Going West"".

I don't have any of the full season sets for ""Wagon Train"", and I only picked this up because it was in a cut-out bin at a local discount store for $6.99. For entertainment value it is great.....because the show was great. But I would far rather just have full seasons, and have TMG knock off all the slicing and dicing of their releases.

I give it three stars because the entertainment value is there. But if you're looking to start collecting more than a few episodes of ""Wagon Train"", DON'T start here. Start with season one.",1463011200,6,1176,4.703883495145631
