2448279,5,B000BYRCQK,"I must say that I love Stripes and Ghostbusters while Groundhog day isn't my favorite movie. I can still quote Stripes and some of Ghostbusters which greatly impressed my teenage son. These movies are super!!!!!! The team of Bill Murray & Harold Ramis is excellant. They really have a great chemistry whether it is acting together or whether Ramis is directing Murray. I highly reccomend these movies!!

2448359,5,B000BYRCQK,"Bill Murray has had a great career. Recently he has been taking more serious parts. This is a great set with that said. Three of Bill Murray's best. Stripes is a classic and so funny. From the start of the movie you will be laughing hard. In that opening scene Bill Murray is a cab driver who gets this rich rude obnoxious customer who insults him throughout the ride. Bill Murray stops the car and stands up for himself in hilarious fashion throwing the car keys over the bridge. His plans now are to give the army a shot.
  Ghostbusters is one of his most famous roles and he does a great job here. GroundHog Day is one of his best movies ever. Stripes is the perfect movie to pop in after a stressful day at work to laugh. I strongly recommend this set. Cheers.",1362355200,2,764,4.2620689655172415

2448382,5,B000BYRCQK,"You've gotta love a movie that features Bill Murray, a groundhog, and time travel. The concept behind this movie has since become famous and widespread. This is still the best.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Groundhog-Day/dp/B001KEHAI0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Groundhog Day</a>&nbsp;essentially teaches Murray's character a lesson in how to care about other people. However, before he learns it, he goes through several hilarious phases. At one point, he gets so sick of repeating Groundhog Day over and over that he tries increasingly creative ways to kill himself. He then tries to use the information he gets from repeating his days to help people out. All the while, Murray's sardonic humor carries the movie and makes it into a classic. Even if you've seen the copy cats, [ASIN:B001KEHAI0 Groundhog Day]] is still worth watching.",1263513600,2,881,6.0
2448383,5,B000BYRCQK,"This set includes three of Bill Murray's best movies:

Stripes, a military film from 1981 with Harold Ramis and John Candy, was directed by Ivan Reitman and has a 6.8 rating from IMDb.

Ghost Busters from 1984 was also directed by Ivan Reitman and features Dan Aykroyd and Harold Ramis, who jointly wrote the imaginative script, and Sigourney Weaver. Ghost Busters currently carries a 7.8 rating from IMDb.

Groundhog Day, the best of the three, was released in 1993 and carries an 8.1 rating from IMDb, which also rates it as #160 on its list of the 250 best movies. Groundhog Day was directed by Harold Ramis, who also co-wrote the outstanding screenplay with Danny Rubin. Andie MacDowell is excellent as the foil for Murray in this film in which Murray plays a self-absorbed TV weatherman who seems to take forever to learn life's lessons after failing miserably, but in the end learning that the Earth does not revolve around him and that showing kindness to strangers is a winning strategy in the end. This is a film that I never tire of watching.",1259280000,5,1052,4.706521739130435

2448386,3,B000BYRCQK,"This package set is a good idea and worth the purchase, however, be aware that you may receive a bad ""Groundhog Day"" disk. Several scenes freeze or have scanning problems, which seriously detract from viewing pleasure. Amazon probably is unaware of this difficulty, because I have never been disappointed with the company's products before. The other two movies were trouble-free.",1236038400,3,380,5.35

Such a great deal,the whole set cost me less than a single sale priced DVD!!! I bought it for Ghostbusters and Stripes(this DVD has BOTH original and extended cuts),but I liked Grounghog Day too after I watched it!!! Each DVD is loaded with great extras as well to boot,but if you own the original 1999 Ghostbusters Special Edition(now a collector's item!)DVD keep it,the version here has slightly different extras than that one(the Live commentary that was on the 1999 version is NOT here(only audio of the same commentary,this DVD is also the exact same one with the Ghostbusters 2-pack by the way just to let you know!),but it still has some great extras though,so it's only a minor qibble!!!
