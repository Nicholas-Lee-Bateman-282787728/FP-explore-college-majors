8701957,4,B00TJ38LRI,"God's Slave (""Esclavo de Dios"") is another compelling release from the good people at Film Movement.  The film's inclusion into that series is no doubt down to the rising talent that is director Joel Novoa.  His fingerprints are all over this film.  It's a surging, driving, building piece of work.  At 90 minutes, it plays out more like a taut, well-crafted TV movie than a feature film.

The film hopscotches around the globe: its first scenes are set amorphously in the Middle East; a few decades pass and sleeper agent Admed (an excellent Mohammed Alkhaldi) is embedded in Caracas; a few years later, Ahmed's call to duty comes and he's shipped to Buenos Aires.  This befits the production of the film itself: co-Venezuelan/Argentine by heritage, its star a Caraquenian of Middle Eastern descent.

What's most interesting: Fernando Butazzoni's script fashions a story around the real-life bombings of the Israeli embassy and AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires (1992, 1994 respectively).  It does this in an oblique manner, but it uses those events to craft its movie as a fictional backstory.  It's a fascinating technique.

Along those same lines, the other part of the film shadows actor Vando Villamil as investigator David Goldberg.  It's never quite said overtly, but Goldberg is Mossad 'boots on the ground' in B.A.  As he tracks down threats, the sleeplessness and obsession starkly etch themselves on his face, frame and broken homelife.  It's not paranoia that has him that way. Reality does.

This is a director to watch.",1442620800,,1545,5.055335968379446
8701958,5,B00TJ38LRI,"GOD'S SLAVE (`Esclavo de Dios') is not only an impressive film it is an important film for many reasons. It brings to light the ongoing acts of terrorism by focusing on an historical even that occurred in 1994 in Buenos Aires, Argentina.  Fernando Butazzoni wrote the stunning script for this film which was directed by the very young Joel Novoa. The actual incident on which it is based is important: The AMIA bombing was an attack on the Asociaci&oacute;n Mutual Israelita Argentina (AMIA; Argentine Israelite Mutual Association) building. It occurred in Buenos Aires on July 18, 1994, killing 85 people and injuring hundreds. It was Argentina's deadliest bombing ever. Argentina is home to a Jewish community of 200,000, the largest in Latin America and sixth in the world outside Israel. In the days following the bombing, Israel sent Mossad agents to Argentina to investigate. The Israeli Police also sent a team of four forensic scientists to assist with the building of ante mortem files and victim identification; the IDF sent personnel to help the Argentines with body extrication. Argentina closed its borders after the attack, fearing more terrorists could enter. It was thought possible that the bombers entered Argentina through the Triple Frontier, where the borders of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet. Argentina's intelligence agency, the Secretar&iacute;a de Inteligencia (SIDE), is said to have set up a network of surveillance called `Centauro' in Paraguay.

Butazzoni has taken this tragedy and backtracked to the childhood times of both the Arab would-be suicide bomber and the Jewish investigator - each having witnessed indelible atrocities at the hands of the two groups - Muslims and Jews. This, then, is the story of Ahmed and David, the two extremist characters, one Islamic and the other Jewish, who cross paths while being in the opposite side of the conflict in the A.M.I.A bombings that took place in 1994 in Buenos Aires. The action shows the tragedies in 1975 Lebanon where Ahmed witnesses the slaughter of his father at the hands of the Jews (and the character of David is important here). The action switches to Caracus, Venezuela 1990 where Ahmed, now a grown man, is sent for his mission: he is to marry, have children, and await his `destiny' to become a suicide bomber to kill Jews. We meet all of Ahmed's friends and his family and we watch David gathering data to thwart what he knows in an incipient bombing. His call for his destiny comes with order to fly to Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1994 to await his hour. How Ahmed's assignment turns out and David's role in that result is the suspense that would ruin the impact of the film if shared.

Ahmed is subtly portrayed by Mohammed Alkhaldi and David by an equally powerful Vando Villamil. The film is in Spanish, Arabic, and a bit of French (?) with English subtitles. The musical score by Emilio Kauderer is particularly fine, the large cast is excellent, and the direction by Joel Novoa is brilliant. Perhaps this film will help more people understand the roots of terrorism and then help end it. Highly Recommended film from the always dependable Film Movement.

8701959,4,B00TJ38LRI,"""God's Slave"" (2013 release from Venezuela; 91 min.) brings the story, based on true events, of two men whoc ouldn't be more different, yet find their paths crossing each other's lives. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Lebanon, 1975"", and Admed, a young Muslim boy, sees his father getting brutally murdered. But by whom? We then shift to ""Caracas, 1990"". Admed is now a man and he has been selected (by whom?) to build a new life in Venezuela, where he marries a local, has a baby and integrates in the community as a doctor. Yet it is all a sham and he is just waiting ""for a phone call some time in the future"". We then shift to ""Buenos Aires, 1994"", where we get to know David, the head of the Israeli Embassy's Security Department. He is tasked with protecting the large Jewish population in Buenos Aires. What will become of Admed and David? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: the first half of the movie is tough to watch, to be honest. Not because the movie isn't any good, but because you will likely be appalled, as was I, by the senseless fanaticism displayed by the Muslims, who will go to any length, if we can believe the portrayal shown in the movie, to kill Jews. At some point there is a large attack on a Jewish synagogue resulting in 80 deaths and dozens more severely wounded, and the movie shows a group of Muslims watching it on TV and screaming ""We crushed the Jews!"", celebrating like their team has scored a goal in the World Cup. Just sickening. The second half of the movie is far more nuanced, when it focuses much more on the two lead characters, and the doubts both of them have as they plow on. Whereas the first half focuses on religious hatred and fanaticism, the second half plays out more like a political cat-and-mouse thriller. It's amazing to think that this movie is directed by a young (27) and upcoming talent in hisfeature length debut. I also want to point out the beautiful (even if mostly somber) musical score, composed by Emilio Kauderer. The DVD comes with a making-of featurette as well as interviews with the director, producer and the lead actors. Bottom line: ""God's Slave"" is definitely worth checking out.

This is the April, 2015 release in Film Movement's DVD-of-the-Month-Club. As usual, the DVD comes with a bonus shortie, and this time we are truly treated to something special. ""Machsom"" (2013 release from Israel; 24 min.) brings the story of a conflicted 19 yr. old Israeli soldier who is stationed at a dangerous checkpoint along the West Bank. Just watch! Meanwhile, ""God's Slave"" is a worthwhile addition to the ever-growing Film Movement catalogue of foreign and indie movies.",1429228800,4,2751,4.635245901639344
