1616791,5,B00005K9F2,"Korea: My fathers time. As a baby boomer who's prior generation got caught up in this conflict, I find this tape to be most usefull. It's presentation of heroes well known to my generation such as Ted Williams, Scott Glenn and others tell stories of the conflict I never knew and enjoyed hearing. I have bought this tape and handed it out to heroes I met on the street to pass along to those whose families still do not the the hardship these men went through. It will bring relief to those who have never vented their stories to their loved ones. Buy it, Keep it, and pass along an extra one to someone who could use an uplift from that time .",1233014400,4,644,4.2439024390243905

1616793,5,B00005K9F2,"Korean War Stories (Robert Uth, PBS) presents a unique combination of interesting interview pieces with amazing film footage, offering the viewer the rare opportunity to see into the characters that have saved us from more struggle throughout the last 50 years (this is 2005). One of the most poignant collections of interviews is that which details Brad Smith's efforts to defend the Army's position in the early, heartbreaking months of the War; how our under protected, underequipped soldiers woke up to a wall of Chinese, Russian, and North Koreans bearing heavy tanks down on Americans with nothing but unsophisticated rocket launchers to defend themselves. The producer, Robert Uth, seems to have found the perfect blending of true history and testimony, with documentary footage and imagery. The original music (other than the Willie Nelson performance) is exceptionally moving and draws the viewer into the experience even more. Korean War Stories is a magnificent production I thoroughly recommend.",1127433600,44,1007,5.461538461538462
1616794,5,B00005K9F2,"I'm a United States history teacher and I've seen quite a few by now, and this is the best I have seen covering the Korean War.  It has great maps that show the different stages of the war.  The maps help illustrate things such as the DMZ, The Pusan Perimeter, The Inchon Invasion and The Chosin Reservior. Actually I think it is far better than ""Dear America: Letters From Vietnam"" because it doesn't have actors reading the letters, it has the real vets talking about their experiences.  If you're looking for a great documentary to explain and give insight on the Korean War, this is a must.  Be prepared, some of the interviews are tremendously emotional, to say the least.  Definitely a forgotten victory.",1114473600,39,710,4.693548387096774
