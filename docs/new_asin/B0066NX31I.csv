8494165,5,B0066NX31I,"Simply Scarves is a fun ""how to"" DVD. Jill Swanson taught me to see scarves as a versatile and easy way to accessorize my current wardrobe. Her friendly/professional speaking style makes this DVD fun to watch and learn from. The booklet reminds me how the different styles are accomplished when I'm getting ready. As I write this, I'm wearing a scarf I'd purchased because it was pretty, but hadn't worn because I had no idea what to do with it. I can wear my favorite scarves with more than one outfit by tying it differently - to fit the outfit or my  mood as well as the shape of my face.

Simply Scarves is a wonderful tool for any woman who wants to make the most of the wardrobe she has and who wants to create a look she feels great in.",1321228800,8,743,4.225352112676056
