8619214,1,B00FXIBJVS,Only Japanese audio and subtitles. And mine didn't come with art book.,1514592000,,70,4.916666666666667
8619215,5,B00FXIBJVS,So I totally didn't read that this was only in Japanese but honestly I was so excited about the art book that I'm willing to buy the next few volumes to collect the art books and have the show. This is a great collection for fans of Kill la Kill even if you don't speak Japanese. Eventually I'll learn Japanese and be able to enjoy the disc itself haha,1438560000,2,352,4.115942028985507

8619217,5,B00FXIBJVS,"This is one of the best purchases I have invested in. Check out the three photos up there that compares Attack on Titan BD Vol. 1 and Boku wa Tomodachi BD Vol. 1! This is the First Press Limited Edition which comes with an art book. I have yet to open this and I've had it for a week now. It's so gorgeous to look at. I don't know what to do with it. I'm a big freaking fan of Gurren Lagann (muscle-anime as they call it) and now I am a huge fan of Kill la Kill (sexist-anime). I'm going to collect all of the BDs First Limited Editions.

I purchased mine directly from Amazon.co.jp so I don't know if these sellers will sell you this item with the art book!",1390521600,4,658,3.984848484848485
