2910411,3,B000TUDBFC,"Being a fan of John Carpenter, I'm familiar with most of his work. However, I recently saw this film for sale in the mall, and I had never heard of it before. So I decided to buy it. After doing some research, I realized why this film is somewhat obscure. It was a made-for-TV movie written just before Halloween. And up until a couple of years ago, it wasn't available on DVD. After viewing it for the first time, there's really not much I have to say about it. It's a combination of ""When a Stranger Calls"" (for those like me, who saw that one before this one) and ""Rear Window"",the Alfred Hitchcock classic. And its easy to see the influence that Hitchcock has on some of Carpenter's early work. However, this is a made-for-TV film, so there is hardly any violence or language in this one. In some ways, I think this hurts the film, because I do find that the film is a bit un-eventful and bland for the most part. And though the ending is somewhat climatic I suppose, it just doesn't really do much for me. All in all, this is a decent little movie, definitely worth viewing a few times, and probably worth owning as well, especially if you're a Carpenter fan. But it isn't quite as memorable as other work of John Carpenter.",1248220800,,1229,4.37117903930131
2910412,4,B000TUDBFC,"""Someone's Watching Me"" was a really pleasant surprise. I've watched all the Carpenter films over the years and am a huge fan of his but by no means a Carpenter expert. I hate to admit that I never heard of this little made-for-TV movie and was thrilled to see it was on DVD.  My wife and I watched it late at night and we really enjoyed it. It is definitely not completely cut out of the usual Carpenter mold with the awesome synthesizer music and the usual mainstay actors that he re-uses, or the gore and shock value.  It is mostly a building of a feeling of terror and mystery.  There is the constant wondering WHO the stalker is? Carpenter nicely has the main character Leigh meet several men in the movie whom you believe could be the stalker/killer.  But you never really know?

Charles Cyphers is in this flick and Adrienne Barbeau, both mainstays of Carpenter's films. Cyphers has been in a heap of his movies over the years playing mostly cops or bosses.  Barbeau, Carpenter's now ex-wife, plays, of all things, a lesbian! Pretty bold for 1978! LOL  Lauren Hutton, of whom I'm not really a fan, does a solid job and excels in making Leigh a quirky but likeable, strong lead female character.

I thought there were some great tense moments and they were genuinely a little scary.  No blood and guts, no Michael Myers moments, but the buildup and tension, plot, dialogue, and ending were satisfying.

If you're considering buying this, DO IT. It's fun for a Friday night spook thriller to watch with your lady. Break out the popcorn and watch it. It's worth the fourteen or fifteen clams and I guarantee in a few years you'll want to watch it again. It's not Carpenter's best, but it's a keeper for sure. Enjoy!",1248048000,3,1719,4.5519480519480515
2910413,3,B000TUDBFC,"I was so excited to see the 'forgotten' John Carpenter film finally getting a DVD release. He's one of my favorite directors. Unfortunately this is one of his weakest films and probably my least favorite.

It's not all bad and has some genuinely tense moments, but they are few and far between. I'm not sure if John Carpenter just wasn't feeling it with this one or if it was due to the constraints of it being a T.V. movie with the constant breaks required for commercials. Whatever it is, the film is a series of peaks and valleys. The pace is off. You just don't get enough of a feeling of building tension. It's funny, because this film was preceded by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Assault-on-Precinct-13/dp/B00008974J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Assault on Precinct 13</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000RIWAVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;and followed by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fog/dp/B000AM6OQ2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Fog</a>&nbsp;and all are excellent, suspenseful films.

In this movie there are a number of good scenes. The bits with the laundry room, the park at night, the penthouse, the search of a house and the last fifteen minutes are great. But in between there are plenty of dull spots.

The music was kind of irritating. I wish John Carpenter had gotten to score this one like he does most of his movies. But he didn't and the music is here seems like a swipe of better music from other suspense movies and at times was just inappropriate for the scene. The best part musically was a scene where Leigh is opening a strange package that was synched to Vivaldi's '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Winter/dp/B000003CSU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Winter</a>'. That part was very well done, but also pointed out how bad the rest of the music was.

Also, Lauren Hutton just didn't seem right for the part. She's a good actress and the part was written well, but the two didn't seem to connect.

One highlight of the movie is Adrienne Barbeau. She is terrific in her part. It's easy to see why J.C. used her in his future movies (well, aside from their marriage). I wish she were in the movie more.

Also, I applaud him for writing in a positive lesbian character. It must have been scandalous for a T.V. movie from 1978. She wasn't stereotypical, never made any 'sinister' passes at our heroine and also wasn't portrayed as the 'magical gay character'. Kudos to John Carpenter.

This movie is worth a rental. But compared to what John Carpenter had done before and would do in the future, this entry was weak.",1234915200,3,2755,5.656174334140436
2910414,4,B000TUDBFC,"A very good American ""giallo"" film
written and directed by John Carpenter.

I'm a John Carpenter fan and I'm surprised
that this film is overlooked when a discussion
of his films is engaged.
I'm also surprised that this was a television
production.
It is certainly good enough have
been released in theaters.

A clever killer stalking a woman
is not an unique plot,
but it is all in how it's done
and Carpenter does it right.
If you enjoy Hitchcock and Argento,
you will certainly enjoy this,
although it is not in that league.

The pacing is great.
Slowly building the tension
from beginning to end.
It gets better and better with
some virtuoso cinematography.

The very ending was somewhat
disappointing for me.
Not experientially which is excellent,
but rather the plot.
That is a subjective opinion.
I have no doubt that others
would defend it vigorously
and I can guess what their valid
arguments would be.

The only substantial flaw in the film
was the musical score.
It is standard canned TV movie music.
If this film was also scored by John Carpenter,
in his unique style,
it would have been several degrees better.

I would love it if Mr. Carpenter composed
a score for this film and re-released it
on DVD.

There is a notable discontinuity in the
circumference of a scanning telescope image
that is sloppy film-making/editing
and partially damages a great sequence.

I Love This Kind Of Thing:
Check out the reflection of the man's face
in the knife on the insert illustration.
Look at it up close and then from a distance.
Nice!

You will want to watch
""Someone's Watching Me""

which makes it an excellent
addition to your collection.",1228348800,,1660,4.736111111111111
2910415,5,B000TUDBFC,"""Someone's Watching Me"" is a long time favorite of mine and I'm glad it can now be enjoyed on video.

This film is in the very best tradition of a great Hitchcock film. John Carpenter does a superb job with the direction. Lauren Hutton did a more than credible acting job and carries this film from the first scene to the end, as she was in almost every scene.  Hutton is an under rated actress, probably because she came from the modeling world, but in this film it is obvious she has some serious acting chops. She is well supported in ""Someone's Watching Me"" by another very under rated actress, Adrienne Barbeau. Barbeau is excellent and very believeable in her supporting role.

If you are a fan of Hitchcock I highly recommend this film.  Carpenter serves the Hitchcock tradition proudly.  Another reason to enjoy this film is the fine acting of Hutton and Barbeau.  This is an under rated film that deserved more recognition.  The work of Carpenter, Hutton and  Barbeau is superb.",1212105600,4,987,4.664739884393064
2910416,4,B000TUDBFC,"**Mild spoilers**

I have been a huge fan of EARLY John Carpenter ever since I was a kid. From the absolute awesomeness of Halloween, the grungy thrills of Assault on Precinct 13, the intense paranoia and pessimism of The Thing to the sheer junk heaven of Big Trouble in Little China, his early films are sheer cinema bliss. So when I recently saw that Someone's Watching Me, a TV movie he made right before Halloween, had been finally released on DVD a couple of years ago, I raced out to get it. The film stars Lauren Hutton as a young woman who moves to Los Angeles and finds a job at a local TV station. She moves into a high-end, high-rise apartment building that faces another high-rise. Soon after moving in she is stalked by someone in the other apartment building, although she is initially unaware that anything is amiss. Alright, I admit that this story outline makes this sound like a lame direct-to-DVD potboiler, but the fun in the film comes from its less predictable, even bizarre elements. First off, Hutton's character is really unlike any other main character I've seen; a real goofball, she happily chatters away to herself walking down the halls of her apartment building and makes jokes that other characters don't get or that cause them to squirm. The strange way in which she is stalked, which involves a series of gifts sent by a fictional travel agency asking her to guess the destination of her prize trip so that she can win it, also adds to its unpredictability. I also adore the scene where Hutton, sitting by herself in her car, is approached by a man who leans in and says ""It's a hell of a life, isn't it?"" then stumbles away, never to be seen again. Sadly the plausibility starts to take a steep dive in the final scenes as the inevitable confrontation is nothing you haven't seen a million times in many other movies. Still, I found the movie highly entertaining (enough that I watched it a second time the next night, something I never do).",1210896000,2,1976,4.581920903954802

2910418,4,B000TUDBFC,"Right after his bleakly hilarious DARK STAR and the wonderfully tense ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (where even a little girl is not spared from the mayhem), John Carpenter ran head-on into man's greatest horror- Network television! Confined to a medium consisting of almost pure cheeze, Carpenter directed a decent thriller called SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME. TV director, Liegh Micheals (Lauren Hutton) is ""stalked"" by a creep w/ a telescope and surveillance equipment. This guy is serious about his obsession, even bugging Liegh's apartment and controlling her electricity! Liegh has tried moving, changing her number to an unlisted one, etc., but nothing works. Now, with the help of her friend Sophie (Adrienne Barbeau of The Fog, Creepshow) and her new boyfriend (David Birney), Liegh sets out to catch the bothersome freak. With some obvious (and frequent) nods to REAR WINDOW and a strong, gutsy female lead, SWM is not typical tele-junk. I enjoyed Liegh's courage and her ""I'm not gonna put up with this"" attitude.

2910419,4,B000TUDBFC,"Someone's Watching Me is sort of the forgotten movie of John Carpenter's career. Someone's Watching Me aired back on November 29th of 1978, which was almost a month after Carpenter's career took off with the horror classic Halloween.

Originally John Carpenter wrote the movie as theatrical film, but Warner Brothers decided to make it a TV movie. In my opinion I think that was the right move. Even though this movie aired after Halloween it was actually filmed prior.

I have to admit I enjoyed this movie quite a bit, but I don't think it would have worked as well as a theatrical film. You can clearly though see flashes of the brilliance Carpenter would show through out his career. Despite his reputation as a filmmaker who uses violence, Carpenter aims more for suspense and tension. This is a TV movie so the violence will obviously be lacking, which in some ways I think is a plus. Carpenter had to create a certain amount of tension and suspense and rely on that to make up for the lack of violence.

John Carpenter has stated many times his love of Alfred Hitchcock and here he pays homage to the master of suspense with a movie clearly inspired by Rear Window. The screenplay by John Carpenter is well-written though there are some cheesy moments in the script. The structure of the script I don't think really works well as a theatrical film. Had it been a feature I'm sure there would have been changes made though.

As I stated Someone's Watching Me is one of the forgotten movies in John Carpenter's career; while watching this flick you can see the potential John Carpenter had and in my opinion very much lived up to. Like I brought up earlier despite coming out after Halloween, this was shot prior to it and Carpenter really grew as a filmmaker in that short period of time. While not every single moment of the film works great, Carpenter was learning his craft and does a wonderful job.

Despite being a TV movie Carpenter makes up for everything and does a solid job at creating suspense and tension through out. One of my favorite things about the movie is the phone calls. While they can be a bit creepy at times they start off as more annoying than anything. The caller isn't really saying anything that could get him in much trouble and he's actually sending gifts, which prompts Lauren Hutton's character to say something along the lines of what do I tell the police he's sending me gifts?

There are a couple of creepy moments in the phone calls, but it's not really about that. It's more on the fact this guy knows her every move and that is why it gets creepy.  The 2nd half of the movie really picks up with the suspense and delivers on that area more than a lot of theatrical movies. One of the very best scenes is when Lauren Hutton's character is in the callers' house and Adrienne Barbeau is in Hutton's house. I don't wanna spoil the scene, but it was a classic John Carpenter moment.

The cast delivers mostly solid performances with Lauren Hutton in the lead. Adrienne Barbeau and Charles Cyphers have supporting roles and both would work with Carpenter a couple of times.

Overall Someone's Watching Me is a solid suspense/thriller early in John Carpenter's career and the potential was shown and he lived up to that. Don't expect much violence keep in mind this is a TV movie so there is only so far Carpenter can go, but like I said he makes up for that is suspense and tension.

Someone's Watching Me may not be one of the best movies Carpenter has ever made, but it's a very solid one and can stand proud in his body of work. Due to the fact this movie for the longest time was not available on VHS or DVD it's rarely seen. Hopefully now with the DVD release from Warner Brothers more Carpenter fans will seek out this forgotten classic.

Little bit of trivia, this movie is the first time John Carpenter and Adrienne Barbeau worked together and this is the movie in, which they first met and would later get married.",1191369600,21,3961,4.525874125874126

2910425,4,B000TUDBFC,"While 'Someone's Watching Me' may not be Halloween, The Fog, or Escape from New York, it certainly delivers both thrills and chills. The story is not the most original; kind of like a reverse Rear Window where someone with a telescope is terrorizing someone across the way in another building. The police are helpless; what can they do to a crank phone caller?

The movie, as I've said, may not have the best story, but John Carpenter delivers a well paced and directed TV movie that would have pleased even the Master of Suspense himself.

2910426,3,B000TUDBFC,"Just prior to shooting Halloween (1979), what would become his breakout film, John Carpenter worked on the made for TV movie Someone's Watching Me (1978), which he both wrote and directed.  The film featured fashion model turned actress Lauren Hutton, as a TV producer being terrorized by an unknown stalker.  With virtually no violence until the end, the film spends most of its time trying to ratchet up the pressure, and building the level of suspense and frustration.  The effort is moderately successful, but the film moves at a very slow pace.  The perpetrator turns out to be someone completely unknown, which somewhat lessens the film's impact.

A new arrival to Los Angeles, TV producer Leigh Michaels (Hutton) has just taken a luxury unit in the Arkum Tower, a high rise apartment building, and found a job at a local TV station.  Trying to settle in, she has no idea that someone has bugged her apartment, as she begins to receive crank phone calls, and the lights in her apartment mysteriously dim down.

Leigh makes friends with Sophie (Adrienne Barbeau), a coworker at the station, and also begins a relationship with college professor Paul Winkless (David Birney).  She receives a letter from a company purporting to give away gifts, and a free vacation trip to a mysterious location.  A telescope arrives as a gift, and as the taunting calls continue, it becomes apparent that someone is watching her inside the apartment.  Leigh also finds notes stuck to her door, which leads to her doing some investigating.  Utilizing the telescope, Sophie and Leigh scan the surrounding buildings and spot a man with a telescope.  Finally able to get some assistance from the police, their efforts lead to a suspect with a suspicious past.  The man is driven out of town, but when Leigh spots another man using a telescope, her problems aren't over yet.

The story nicely builds up the pressure, as Leigh continues to be tormented by a twisted unknown weirdo.  There is a sense of frustration, first because things develop so slowly, and then because the police totally ignore proper procedure, when Leigh witnesses a crime.  With Paul's help, Leigh gets on the trail of the only man in the entire city of Los Angeles who could be responsible.  After such an interminable wait, the final confrontation in Leigh's apartment, a brief flash of clichd violence, is a bit of a letdown, as it is not staged or executed very well, and Carpenter makes a completely obscure character the villain.

Lauren Hutton's acting performance is pretty good, except perhaps in some of the action scenes.  John Carpenter met his future wife Adrienne Barbeau making this film, and they would collaborate several more times, including The Fog (1980), and Escape From New York (1981).  Barbeau is very good, and the reliable David Birney also delivers a solid performance.

With its provocative subject matter, sense of mystery, and attractive stars, it's easy to understand why Carpenter's tale of suspense was solid entertainment for the small screen at the time, though today it may seem rather tame.  Intended to fit into a two hour block, the story seems longer than it needs to be, and drags at times, but is still a decent enough watch for a TV thriller.",1322784000,4,3242,4.888482632541133

8210985,4,B000TUDBFC,"Before his big breakthrough with ""Halloween,"" John Carpenter took a paycheck from NBC, pumping out this nearly-forgotten TV-movie, ""Someone's Watching Me!"" (exclamation mark is part of its title, and is neither a stylistic choice or an indication of over-enthusiasm on this writer's part). Starring Lauren Hutton as the ""Me!"" being watched, the film is admittedly limited in scope, being that it was created for network television with advertisers in mind. As a John Carpenter affair, though, it serves as a rather engaging sandbox for the director to flex his muscles before ultimately conquering both the horror genre and independent cinema alike. The long tracking shots, the deceptively simple yet complex camera tricks, the mounting tension -- just about everything you associate with vintage Carpenter can be found here, albeit in a somewhat neutered fashion.

Leigh Michaels (Hutton) has just moved to L.A. and is looking to start her life over again. All seems to be going to plan, as she finds a job working in television almost instantly, befriends a spunky co-worker (Adrienne Barbeau) and wins the affections of a charming fellow bar-patron (David Birney). Unfortunately, some creep in the high-rise apartment across from her has taken a liking to her, stalking her from both near and afar, and sending threatening phone calls that are just vague enough so that the local authorities (Charles Cyphers) can't do much about them. Being the self-sufficient scrapper with a heart of gold (and biting sense of humor to boot) that she is, Leigh takes matters into her own hands and faces the creeper head-on in what turns out to be a rather tense (and vertigo-inducing) showdown.

Lauren Hutton is both the star and the best part of the movie. Her character is so well-written and down-to-earth, and Hutton brings it to life with such natural ease, that you feel like you know this person already. This of course makes it all the easier to sympathize and get wrapped up into her plight. It helps, of course, that she is directed by someone like Carpenter, who cares as much about his characters as he does about milking the suspense of any given situation. It's not his flashiest film, and heck, he didn't even get to score it himself, but there's a certain element of class that Carpenter brings to the table that makes you forgot you're watching a made-for-TV movie. Also of note: Carpenter was clearly inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" and that fact oozes into more than a few corners of the film. The film almost plays like a reversal of said film, but regrettably ""Front Window"" wouldn't have been a very catchy title. ""Someone's Watching Me!"" may not have a great title or much of a reputation, but it is definitely of interest to lovers of good suspense and John Carpenter alike.",1509148800,,2803,4.949044585987261
