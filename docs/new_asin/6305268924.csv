1001249,5,6305268924,"I teach a third grade Sunday school class, and I always use a Veggie Tales video if there's one to fit in with our lesson.  Today, as a prelude to Thanksgiving, we watched Madame Blueberry.  The kids loved it, and they  were able to apply what they saw to their own lives (""hmmmmm, maybe I  don't need every Pokemon trading card"").  I wish QWERTY had used an  additional Bible verse about thankfulness (in addition to the Proverb on  greed), but that's the only thing about this video that wasn't perfect.",943142400,9,505,4.544444444444444

1002174,4,6305268924,"I grew up on VeggieTales, at least the first dozen or so originals. I loved them as a kid. My dad was a pastor, so the Christian messages were really what made them welcome in our home. I'm now 19 and for nostalgia's sake decided to rewatch some of my favorites. The songs are most definitely stuck in my head again!  And I still remember how much I and my siblings loved them as a kid. But somehow.... maybe it's just growing up, but the movie no longer seemed sincere.
Here's what I mean: Madame Blueberry was miserable and depressed because she didn't have everything she wanted. She goes on an enormous shopping spree and realizes mid-way through that it's not making her happy (she realizes this in the store, while her purchases are being delivered). She also sees her house tipping, so she races to stop the deliveries, but she's too late. All her new purchases fall into the lake, and her house gets thrown out of a tree and smashed. She (and Bob and Larry and Jr. and Jr's dad) all join this poor family whose girl is having a birthday party with only one slice of pie. And everyone's happy and thankful. But really, in the end, everyone (except maybe Jr and his dad) are worse off than ever. It's one thing to teach us not to be greedy. It's another to give the impression that it's better to be poor because it makes you more thankful for the things you have.
However, that's me being cynical more than anything. It's still a good movie for young kids.",1402444800,,1463,4.398523985239852

When we first discovered this episode, me and my 3 year old daughter (she's now almost 5) were home while my wife was with her father in the hospital after he broke his hip.  Needless to say, we were feeling a little down and worried about how he was going to be (he was 80 and is now doing fine) so it was nice finding this episode to make us laugh.  The trombone comes in right after Madame Blueberry's tree house tips over from having too much stuff in it and all the stuff falls out.  Just when you think everything has fallen out, you hear a little trombone play a note that slides down as one more item hits the deck and for some reason when I heard that I started laughing out loud.  She apparently thought my laughing was funny so she started laughing too and now she always wants to watch that episode just because of that!

This franchise should be listed under Christian or God and Spirituality videos.
I am not an atheist - but if you actually see some of the stuff they come up with in some of the Veggietales - your jaw will drop open.
This is a very cute way to program an agenda into a small persons head - not the type of stuff many of us want to expose them to and it should be openly labeled as Christian Children's Movie.",1357344000,,608,4.342105263157895

Although this is a fairly entertaining episode and was the first to feature one of my favorite characters, a silly and vain little french Blueberry, the story is somewhat lacking. While on a buying spree at the local veggie Stuffmart, Madame learns that there are people who are grateful to God with no stuff at all. Then Madame wrecks her house by overbuying stuff and shares a meal with her less fortunate friends.

Not as creative as later veggietales and doesn't use an established bible story. The silly song is sweet, but the other two songs featured in the story are not great: one is a lackluster child's song about gratitude and the other is of the type I find questionable--a bunch of scallions singing about how important it is to have more stuff. My kids love singing Veggie songs and repeat anything they hear, so it's a little disturbing to hear them singing ""all you need is much--more--stuff"".

A decent overall episode but you're better off with one of the newer choices--Ballad of Little Joe, Mo and the Big Exit, Sheerluck Holmes, Minnesota Cuke.",1200614400,2,1130,4.760204081632653

This is maybe for children, but as a grown up, it speaks volumes to our culture of overspending and hoarding goods, and greed. And it makes you laugh while it teaches you the lesson.

Well, we find Bob on the set and ZZZOOOMMM!! ZZOOOMMM!!! SSCCREEEECCHHHH!! Larry parks this big lug of a toy action jeep right beside our tomato friend. But Larry says when he gets a thing or 2 more, THEN he'll be happy. Bob asks the right question, ""Larry, how much stuff do you need to be happy?"" Good topic for the show, right?

I'm surprised anyone thought that the concept that ""stuff does not make you happy"" is too hard for kids to comprehend.  These days, virtually all of children's programming is basically made up of half-hour commercials for merchandise and toy lines, so this was extremely refreshing to see.  The end is very concrete and leaves no room for confusion in a young child.  My son was becoming extremely greedy and Mr. Asky McGrabby every time we went to any store, but it seems like he actually *learned* something with this video, because a gentle, ""Are you gonna be like Madame Blueberry was?"" makes him smile AND stop the constant toy-pleading.
I don't disagree, though, that this video delivers a message that many adults would do well to internalize as well. =)",1076544000,4,1017,4.72316384180791
1002600,5,6305268924,"My son started watching Madame Blueberry at 3 months old - it was one of only two videos he would sit still for and enjoy. (Silly Song Countdown was the other - highly recommended!!!) And as often we have played it - neither he, myself, Daddy, or even Nana gets bored of it. My son may not fully understand the message until he gets older, but the rest of us do and has come up to rememberance on more than one occasion. (Nana recently told me that she was feeling ""blue"" going Christmas shopping and was singing ""I'm so blue..."" to herself, then realized that she wasn't being thankful for what she had and quickly changed her tune to ""Thankful Heart."" )The story line is fun and humorous for kids to enjoy, but with enough content included to keep adults quite entertained themselves. The songs are hilarious and addicting - and you'll gain a new appreciation for the Blue Danube. The Thankfulness Song is a real treat. There's lots of music and movement from the very beginning to keep young babies attention for a while. This really is a fun video and quite entertaining.",1072915200,3,1075,4.546391752577319

Veggie tales is a thoroughly delightful way to teach children important lessons in life, the ones too many adults forget! Each offers a different lesson. Madame Blueberry seeks a happy heart.....how wonderful to share the very simple way to achieve this. Those who created the Veggie Tales series have been blessed with foresight, imagination, and wisdom beyond their years.

1002604,5,6305268924,"My family recently discovered the veggie-tales videos, and we were instant fans.  The writing is excellent, combining genuine wit with relavent messages presented in a gentle, non-judgemental way.  The result is a really funny view with the satisfying sense that your kids are not wasting their time by watching.  This video, Madame Blueberry, immediately became our favorite.  The music is so catchy my youngest daughter has started singing, ""I'm so blue-hoo-hoo-blue-hoo-hoo"" whenever she gets confused.  For my part, I find I can always make my wife laugh by singing a bar or two of, ""His Cheeseburger.""
What makes Madame Blueberry so important, however, is its message: material things cannot make you truly happy, being thankful for what you have makes you happy.  Some reviewers have suggested that this message is too advanced for younger children.  I must disagree.  Children barely able to talk are now being subjected to the merciless lure of advertising.  Even if they don't watch television product advertising can be found every form of media, and no potential market is immune!  And regardless of the age of the target audience, the message is the same, ""You need x to be happy.""
In the face of this onslaught, ""Madame Blueberry"" is a welcome relief.  Children need the video's message, that happiness is not something you can buy.  For this reason I give this video five stars.",1047340800,3,1392,5.057017543859649
1002605,5,6305268924,"I think I love this story more than my nieces do. Its simple, entertaining and the ""That's why I give thanks"" songs are catchy and very sweet.

1002606,5,6305268924,"This is a devestating attack on greed in general, but particularly on the kind of consumerism that obsesses so many people in the United States. You'd think it would be hard for a computer-animated vegetable to actually perform an affecting scene, but this video actually pulls it off twice. We see two different poor children -- one played by Junior Apsaragus, the other by some kind of stalk with a nodule on top -- who can find it in their hearts to be grateful for what they have depsite their poverty. It's a stark contrast to Madame Blueberry herself, a wealthy fruit who is not content with her possessions no matter how many she has. For all that, the music is great, the silliness is sillier than many a silly thing you'll run across, and my kids love it. This is easily one of the best two or three Veggie Tales.
The title is an obvious spoof of ""Madame Bovary"" which I unfortunately haven't read, so I can't tell how successful a parody of that book was achieved, or even if one was seriously attempted.",1044748800,2,1014,4.486486486486487

I tried to tell her we had it at home and she could watch it when we got back, she then proceeded to yell blue hoo hoo I dan't know wat ta do and we ended up checking out with Madame Blueberry tightly in her grasp.

The moral of being grateful is a great one for kids to learn as it seems they can never have enough 'stuff'.  The songs in this tape perfectly match the moral of the story, and they were very cute and catchy.  We find ourselves singing ""The Stuff Mart Rap"", and ""I'm So Blue"", all the time.  The story isn't quite as overly religious as some of the other Veggietales are, so it is a great gift for someone who might not appreciate the religious tone.",1021334400,3,530,4.3232323232323235

I almost fell off my couch watching the slick, plaid-clad sales-scallions pitching everything from de-hydrated streudals to 20 gallon woks in the ""Stuff Mart Rap"". But thanks to the sweet-not-sappy Thankfulness song, some good friends, and a giant air compresssor, Madame Blueberry learns that happiness doesn't come from a store -- a lesson that's easy to hum along to the next time you and the kids are finding that padded gopher bopper at the Costco just a little too tempting.",999043200,,656,5.140186915887851

1002657,4,6305268924,"My one year old daughter loves ALL her Veggie Tales, and this one is no exception. However, as a mom, I notice that the message in this video may not be as easily grasped by youngsters as previous Tales. I admire the attempt by Big Idea to include female leads (as they were sorely lacking in that department), however Madame Blueberry is facing problems that are more easily grasped by adults. She feels sad and is sure that if only she could have all the stuff she wanted, it would make her happy. During the course of the video, after having been tempted by the salesmen of StuffMart, she learns her lesson. While this is a great message, kids aren't really faced with shopping for themselves at stores and aquiring more belongings. Also, the destruction of Madame Blueberry's house and the verse that accompanies the story may be too concrete for kids to appreciate. I think this is a better video for the parents to watch. The BEST part of this video, and worth buying the whole thing for, is the ""Thankful Heart"" song that is played several times throughout the video. The words to the song are the real message that the story is trying to put forth. It is sung very sweetly and will definitely find a way into my family when my daughter is old enough to sing.",984355200,5,1266,4.484848484848484
1002658,5,6305268924,"Of the several Veggie Tales we currently own, this is our personal favorite, and for good reason. Madame Blueberry is a VERY blue berry -- so absorbed in her wish for material things that she doesn't appreciate all the good things that she already has, a good home, good friends, and the everyday blessings of life around her. It takes a trip to the ""StuffMart"" (a wonderful send-up on the discount shopping mega-malls that infest our society) and her observations of two small children for her to see that life is more than aquiring things. As the moral of the story says, a thankful heart is a happy heart.
This is a great video for the age 5 to 11 set. All the usual Veggie Tale characters are here, including Bob the Tomato, Larry the Cucumber, and Junior Asparagus. The animation is, as in every Veggie Tale, a visual treat that holds the interest of both children and adults. There are sly sight gags and a silly, campy pace to the voice characterizations. But best of all in this video is the music. The prayer song of the two children -- ""I thank God for this day ..."" is marvelous in its power and simplicity, and one that our child now sings at the dinner table. Doggone it, I know the words too, and I sing along. The hip-hop rendition of the StuffMart advertising jingle is downright funny: what more evidence do you need to know that conspicuous consumption is wrong? And Mr. Lunt's rendition of the ""Cheeseburger Love Song"" is hilarious.
The lesson of this video is delivered with a light touch. It's religious without being preachy or proselytizing. We need more videos like this. I'm betting that even the StuffMart will have them!",978134400,16,1647,4.5864406779661016

Bob and Larry play the  role of Madame Blueberry's butlers. Madame Blueberry is a very blue berry  with an overwhelming desire for ""things."" In the end she learns  some hard lessons and finds joy in thankfulness.
Madame Blueberry has  beautiful animation. The story begins by following a butterfly as it floats  over an imaginary French landscape filled with stunning scenery.
Madame  blueberry also has some great songs. My favorites are the Stuff-Mart Rap  and Mr. Lunt's Cheeseburger Song. Let me take some time here to say that  Mr. Lunt got ripped off...no matter what the petition in Silly Songs 2  says...Mr. Lunt is far better at silly songs than Larry. I'm afraid Mr.  Lunt is suffering oppression at the hands of the system; it all smacks of  cucumber-centrism.
