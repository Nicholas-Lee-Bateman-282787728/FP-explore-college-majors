8266978,2,B00005RZR1,"Stolen Youth is a low budget originally made for TV movie from 1996.  Like other made for TV movies, this one follows the formula and uses a recognisable face from a  popular TV show, in this case Brian Austin Green from Beverly Hills 90210.  Like that show he plays a high school student, like that show, there is no way the audience is buying that in this movie.  He has a hot girlfriend who is also a student who he is having sex with when the phone rings, unrealistically he answers it, it's his mother's friend, her mother has died.  So his mum sends him over to the mother's place the friend who is based in New York is staying at to help her pack up the mother's stuff.  She is some sort of artist, designing CD albums or something which Green's character finds interesting since he is into photography, and it's refreshing this old person unlike his mother isn't carrying on about not achieving her dreams because she had a kid, and wanting to achieve them vicariously through him by forcing him to go to med school.  The mother tries to force her hand by guilting the friend into letting him tag along to a meeting she his having in San Francisco, show him the med school campus and convince him to go there.  Of course the friend isn't into pressuring him to do something he doesn't want to do and just hangs out and has fun with him, she isn't about to say no when he wants to have sex with her.  The mother who gives the mother from the Stephen King movie Carrie a run for her money of worst mother in a movie, is not having this.

There really isn't much to this movie at all.  Initially the mother's disgust seemed to have some merit until the dad points out when she is berating him for not calling the cops that their son is actually 18.  Then really it becomes a deadbeat parent will they wake up to themselves before they ruin everything movie. But one where nothing interesting and that isn't completely predictable happens. The mother is so unlikable that you are actually hoping her son and her daughter as well as soon as she is old enough to move out both do so and just never come back.  At one stage she parks him in then demands he goes home, now it would have been interesting to see how he did that, but it isn't shown.

It also didn't really sell why he wanted to sleep with and date the older woman when he had a much hotter girlfriend his own age.  If she wasn't sleeping with him you could maybe see why, but she was, and she was happy with him being a lowly paid photographer and living in her university room with her if he chose not to become a doctor.  It also didn't explain why the mother was so against the relationship, this was someone who had all the likable qualities to be her best friend in the first place, why should not want her son dating someone with those qualities?  If he'd been fifteen or something there would have been that and this would have been a different movie, but he was 18 and it is what it is.",1484179200,,2959,4.264758497316637
