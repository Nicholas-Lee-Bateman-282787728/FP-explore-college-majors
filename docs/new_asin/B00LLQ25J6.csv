6490409,4,B00LLQ25J6,"VERY MINOR SPOILERS:

At some point during the 1800's, the descendents of Nordic Gods decided that they needed to be under the radar. Where better to emigrate to than the sparsely populated NZ.

In the modern day, God like powers are assigned on ones 21st birthday. It is also important to note that the level (strength) of powers has diminished over the years.

Enter modern day and the 4-Brothers Johnson: (on the eve of youngest brother Axl's 21st birthday):

Mike (AKA the God of Chance/Games) - the oldest who essentially raised his younger brothers. Mike lives a relatively normal life, married and working as a building contractor while rarely using his powers

Anders (AKA God of Poetry and the Spoken Word) - runs a PR Company and frequently uses his powers to secure business and personally to separate females from their ""clothing""

Ty - (AKA God of Cold and Darkness) - he is low key and runs a refrigeration business

Axl - (AKA Odin, the King of all Gods)

There is both excitement and trepidation when it is learned that Axl is the reincarnate of Odin. If Odin can reunite with his beloved Frigg (and consummate said reunion), all of the reincarnated Gods will have their powers restored to an unadulterated form!

There are assorted other characters, including Thor (War God), Loki (Fire God) and their Grandfather Olaf (an Oracle that ages slowly and is 92-years old, despite appearing to be in his 30's). Not to mention the Goddesses (included the super hot Michele - the Goddess of Love and apparently hooking up)

The overriding premise of the series is to help Axl find his Frigg (yet to be revealed).

On the surface the show is a comedy. There are many comedic moments along the way, though I would define as more of a fantasy drama in the same vein as Lost Girl (though not as dark). There is also a fair amount of swearing, nudity and ""hooking up"".

If I were to offer a small criticism, it would be that I would have liked to get a better sense of what makes NZ unique (the backdrop).

It may take a few episodes to become accustomed to the ""Kiwi"" accent.

The best news is that there will be a season 3!",1405382400,,2130,4.556430446194225
6490410,5,B00LLQ25J6,I really enjoyed watching this series. I got this after watching the Flight of the Concords. I wish they would bring this series over to the US!

6490411,5,B00LLQ25J6,"I saw clips of this New Zealand show on YouTube and had to have it.  It only comes in Region 2, so you need to be able to play it somehow.  I realized I wanted to get first and second seasons and the third season when it's available as well as some British DVDs so I bought a cheap ($48) region-free DVD player.  I honestly have not laughed this hard since MASH.  It's funny and irreverent and I love the characters, from sweet responsible Mike to slightly sociopathic Anders.  They are Norse Gods reborn into human form, although they won't get their full powers until the youngest completes a quest.  Meanwhile they try to cope with the fact that when they use their powers things don't tend to go well for the folks around them.  One of the most refreshing things about the show for me is the liberal use of ""language.""  Apparently the Kiwis aren't as uptight as Americans are and the f-word and other are liberally sprinkled around making it sound like they speak, well...normally.  Check it out on YouTube and then go buy yourself a whole lot of entertainment. :)",1366156800,23,1068,4.492227979274611

6490424,4,B00LLQ25J6,"It is important to note that this is not a show you can go into expecting a prose and an exploration of the moral framework of each of the characters.  This is a fun comedy that plays exactly as it is supposed to.  There are twists and turns that you will find delightful if you allow the show to take you on them, but you have to give a chance first.

A few one star reviewers complained that the show is demeaning to women, something I wholly disagree with.  While the first season is a tad raunchy and the plot is often put into the hands of the ""less evolved male character"" Anders, season two and three have several strong female roles that gradually earn the spotlight.

All of that being said, this is a delightful show with decent acting and hilarious moments that will allow you to kick back and travel to a completely unbelievable albeit entirely convincing universe where gods walk around disguised as humans.  If you give it a chance, you will find an appreciation for the effective minimalist effect the screenwriters gave each of the character's powers.  The entire show works, but only if you let it.",1420070400,,1115,4.517412935323383

Anders is a complete dog and barely likable for the first half of the season, but Axl and his sidekicks Zeb and Gaia are fun.  I can't wait for more!",1411689600,,527,4.077669902912621
6490450,5,B00LLQ25J6,Bloody damn good show,1411344000,,21,4.5
6490451,4,B00LLQ25J6,"Over all this is a fun series, most of the characters are likable ... with a couple exceptions.

I found the concept original and I also liked how even though these guys are Norse gods, they are not all powerful and actually have to deal with real world stuff.

The main characters are the four brothers and their grandfather.

Axel is likable, although immature at times (hey he is 21), and while he isn't perfect when push comes to shove he tries to do the right thing.

Ty is a worrier and is the god Hod, god of all things dark and cold. He's power of turning things cold causes major issues with his love life, plus his brother Anders stabs him in the back on this issue also.

Mike is the responsible one. I really liked his character, he take responsibility for things, while some of his other brothers try to take the easy way. Mike raised his brothers and doesn't use his powers of chance due to the fact someone else always has to pay a price for his luck.  So he actually tries to work for what he gets.

The Grandfather Olaf is basically a hippie, and he ages very slowly (think he was 93 in the first season) while most of the time he is likable and fun, he has a darker side. He uses his age as an excuse for not taking responsibility for his actions. Spoiler -- He knocks up a woman (turns out he has done this like 20 times before), and since he ages so slowly he can't help raise the kid.  Ok I get this, but first the stupid twit could wear a condom and he at least could get off his lazy butt, get a job and send money for his kid. Instead he just runs and leaves the woman on her own.

The final main character is Anders, god of poetry (he can talk any mortal into doing what ever he wants). To be honest Anders is the one of the reasons I marked this down from five stars to four.  Spoilers -- Anders is a complete scumbag, basically he in my opinion is a rapist. He uses his powers to convince women to sleep with him and then he tosses them away like garbage. They can be engaged, married, or whatever and Anders doesn't care.  The show at times treated this as a joke almost and I really didn't see any difference between Anders and some pervert who slips roofies into women's drinks in a bar.  He really doesn't have loyalty to anyone but himself, as some of his actions towards Ty and Mike show.

Still the show is fun, and I recommend it to anyone who likes something a bit quirky.  Warning though it does have nudity, simulated sex, and drug use (I personally don't care for the drugs).

By the way does anyone know when season two will be available for download?",1411257600,,2591,4.195564516129032

6490464,4,B00LLQ25J6,"Key warning:  It is a comedy/adventure and there's a lot of profanity (dropping F* bombs with little warning), and some decent nudity, though not as intense as some of the HBO series that are out there now.  Oh yeah and drug and alcohol abuse is pretty prevalent.  Also loaded with reprehensible behavior on the part of most involved.  So, not the best show for little kids.

Basic concept, which at this point is pretty vague, still here's what you have to go on...

Sometime in the past the Norse gods screwed up, somehow got punished, or simply forgot where and what Asgard was and got stuck on earth.

To make things more confusing, reincarnation got thrown into the mix, and the ""Norse God's user guide"" (any idea of who or what they were in general), vanished.

Couple that with dilution of their core abilities each time they reincarnated and you have a group of screwed up miscreants working in the world (carpenter, ad agency, nurse, etc.), with powers barely powerful enough for party tricks.

Now, slap some prophecy on top of that, Odin bangs Frig and everyone gets a full power up back to their original levels (a bit unclear if everyone can get back to Asgard or not.).

First episode, you find out that one of the set of brothers, when he turned 21 winds up being a reincarnated Odin, so the hunt is on for Frig.

Actors are likeable, humor is entertaining, moral questions are raising, interlinkings of the characters look to have a lot of potential..

Considering the dearth of stuff out there at the current time, it's a decently enjoyable ride up to this point (6 or so episodes in).

Those that are more energetic may find the whole series out there somewhere.  My son Googled the thing and from what he found, seems like the whole series is done with around 40 episodes available.

This is low budget, yes, but like Star Trek, TOS, the writers managed to make up for that with great characters and stories.

The Johnsons are Nordic gods that don't have their powers yet, and they have to wait until their geeky little brother claims his rights as Odin before they become the real thing. But for now they're a bunch of hard-drinking, woman-troubled kiwis that need New Zealand slang Universal Translation devices. But don't let that stop you, this is a rip-roaring good time. There's evil, troublesome goddesses to fight, sexy temptresses, Loki spewing trouble everywhere he goes, and generally bad behavior all around.

Auckland? Not really pertinent, but don't be surprised if Hollywood tries to get on the bandwagon and duplicate it over here in the States.",1408406400,2,1096,5.016483516483516

6490475,3,B00LLQ25J6,I will be watching this series. The show was a little slow at points but has an interesting story line.,1407974400,2,103,4.2
6490476,5,B00LLQ25J6,"Wickedly good program, For those of us here in the States it is not just a rather odd form of humor and fun but we also get to learn a new form of slang. I can't say I've ever heard New Zealander before. Some of it is fairly common for anyone who is a BBC fan but pay close attention and you'll pick up a few new words.",1407888000,3,319,3.7058823529411766

6490482,3,B00LLQ25J6,"It's a New Zealand import that may seem too foreign for some Americans.  The premise is interesting.  We'll have to see where they go with it.  The acting is sometimes a little stiff and, well, odd.  I'm not sure if I'll continue with the series or not at this point.",1405814400,2,267,4.28
6490483,5,B00LLQ25J6,"I just watched the first episode.  This seems like an interesting show.  I just read that it was canceled though.  So, we here in the U.S. know that we only get three seasons.  I wonder, would they continue the show if it did well in the U.S.?",1405728000,,243,4.1063829787234045
8666454,5,B00LLQ25J6,"This is a fantastic sci-fi series made in New Zealand. We meet the Johnsons on the youngest brothers 21st birthday. They have a secret, they are living embodiments of the the Norse Gods. Along with a talented cast and mostly likeable characters the story is compelling and realy draws you in.",1526515200,,292,4.745098039215686

This is the quirkiest, wittiest, cutest show I've ever seen - on so many levels. I love the New Zealand scenery and don't mind the simple sets - the writing is SO good. My favorite character is Ty. Love is romances; especially with blondie. Oh, and the ending rocks. He's so tortured and sweet. The surfer hippie grandpa is a hoot. If you want to spend some time with funny gods trying to figure out life on earth, this show is for you. Whimsy in New Zealand.",1489017600,,603,4.252173913043478

8666459,5,B00LLQ25J6,"The plot of this show is outrageous!  The youngest brother finds out on his eighteenth birthday that he and the rest of his family are actually reincarnations of Norse gods.  What ensues is crazy and so entertaining!  The writing on this show is excellent!  Recommended for adults.  Some strong language, nudity and sexual situations.",1469404800,2,334,5.111111111111111

8666462,5,B00LLQ25J6,"This show is freaking great. It's funny and silly and stupid and heartbreaking. A truly bizarre premise, which is that each of these brothers (and their Grandpa) are in fact Norse gods... sort of. But once you get past that, absolutely enjoyable.",1457395200,,246,4.880952380952381
