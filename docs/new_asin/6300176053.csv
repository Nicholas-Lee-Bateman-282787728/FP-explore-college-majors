1177261,3,6300176053,"Making sense of this spaghetti western parody is about as easy as witnessing Shane Macgowan performing all his songs coherently and bearing a perfect set of teeth.  Well, you can at least do the first part by watching Straight To Hell.  In fact, Alex Cox recruits quite a number of well known celebrities to make came appearances in the film.  The Pogues play a family of caffeine addicts, while Grace Jones and Dennis Hopper make notable cameo appearances.  Also, Elvis Costello appears here and there as Hives the Butler.
The film is full of amusing moments, but the storyline is almost nonexistent.  That's okay, it's an Alex Cox film.  What does make this movie worthwhile, despite it's weak story, is Alex Cox's form.  His main characters are played out well, with Richardson, Strummer, and Rude giving good performances.  Courtney Love's performance, however, leaves much to be desired and is a far cry from some of her later film roles.  What one will find here, amongst all the incoherent ruble, is a film that must have at least been seen by Quentin Tarantino (and of course, only a video junkie of his stature would have seen this film).
Not a great film, but certainly influential.  Alex Cox has great form and the host of indie celebrities are amusing.

Straight to Hell comes off as a purely self-indulgent vanity piece. Like the road to Hell, I'm sure director Cox had very good intentions when he got together with many of his friends in a small Mexican ghost town (actually Spain) and just let the camera roll while everyone improvised. Given all of the peronas involved (including many legends from the early 1980s punk scene and independent filmmakers) you would expect something at least slightly interesting to occur. Unfortunately, the result is just directionless and meandering. Whereas films like Repo Man are iconoclastic and make interesting comments about the disintegration of society, this is just a mess about a bunch of adults acting silly. It may have been fun to film, but it is a chore to sit through.
I wonder if Cox truly felt he had created a worthwhile movie, or if he just tried to salvage whatever he could from the footage he shot after going to the expense. Whatever the case, this disaster bascially ended Alex Cox's career by making it impossible for him to find any further financial backing (he only made one more cheap film in Mexico). Talk about going out with a whimper.
For those who care, this is Courtney Love's first film, from before she became famous through marriage. Everything else about Straight to Hell is equally as trivial as that piece of information.",1053216000,5,1380,4.851694915254237
1177263,4,6300176053,"I saw this movie once, in college and was boggled by all the randomness- it seems like every character has a different foreign accent, Zander Schloss sings a song about Disco Hotdogs, Grace Jones makes out with Dennis Hopper (and in the 'making of' featurette he forgets her last name!!!! oh my god!!!!!), Joe Strummer gets his vampire love on, and Courtney Love wails a lot of catchy phrases in her pre-plastic surgeries, screechy voice.
It's pretty sweet, all in all.
If you like that sort of thing.
The 'making of' part explains how the film came about and why it's so disjointed.... and it is a pretty sloppy piece of film making... but it's cool that it was made and had enough support to make it out on DVD.
The only thing that disturbs me about the film is that they keep saying 'Shikso' or maybe 'shiksa' when I think they meant to say 'meshuggah' or something. I dunno. It's really odd.
I like this movie in the same way that I like the Fishing with John episodes, Buckaroo Banzai and The South Park Movie...and maybe Liquid Sky.",1041206400,7,1038,4.497354497354498

1177267,2,6300176053,"Straight to Hell (Alex Cox, 1987)

Alex Cox made a very fast name for himself in the mid-eighties, releasing two classic films in the space of three years, Repo Man and Sid and Nancy.  Then the downward slide began, and precipitous it was. Straight to Hell, Cox's fourth film, may well have been the nadir; it's hard to imagine a filmmaker this talented making a film this bad, and impossible to imagine a filmmaker this talented making one worse.

Straight to Hell is a spaghetti western that's ingested a large number of psychedelic drugs. It follows three hitmen (scriptwriter Dick Rude, ex-Clash guitarist Joe Strummer, and the only actor in the bunch, Sy Richardson) through a couple of botched jobs in Mexico, after which they flee to the strangest desert town to be found outside Jodorowsky's similarly muddy western El Topo. In fact, not only the town has Jodorosky written all over it in unreadable graffiti; the whole film, with the exception of the added love interest, could have been cut from the same cloth as was El Topo. There are, no doubt, art film fans who would consider that a boon, but I always found El Topo to be the weakest of Jodorowsky's movies, and Cox undercuts an already unstable base with amateur acting, and then adds the always-annoying Courtney Love in a major role. The project was bound for disaster from day one. If you've seen El Topo (or the better distillation of it that is the last third of David Lynch's film Wild at Heart), you can safely pass this up and head straight for Cox's more recent documentary work. * ",1019520000,6,1557,4.671532846715328
1177268,5,6300176053,"Alex Cox's ""Straight To Hell"" is such a strange and unique pop film that I'm not quite sure how to go about reviewing it. Perhaps if I can break down the elements. The film is based round the time of its release and deliberately has all the cliches of the typical 1960s Italian ""Spaghetti"" Western; the mood, humour, and style is like that of Jim Jarmusch (who plays ""Mr. Dade"" in the film), David Lynch, and the Coen Brothers; and the cast is a wonderfully entertaining group of New Wave/Punk Icons and edgy, idiosyncratic character actors; the plot: 3 Hitmen and a pregnant girlfriend oversleep and miss their scheduled ""hit"" and deside to rob a bank to make up for the loss of money, which leads them to hide out and bury the money; the setting: a virtual ""Ghost Town"" in Spain--I say virtual, but there are a few occupants: a Spanish tavern keeper, hardware/general store owners consisting of a sexy Latin lady and her war-crazed, half-a-man husband, a Priest and Coffin maker, a mobile butler who consitently serves coffee, a flamboyant singer (ala Liberace), a singer/songwriter who sells hot dogs, the gun-slinging, violent, and caffeine-addicted Mac Mahon Gang, and a few crazed others. Acknowledging the cast during the film is quite fun in itself, from Joe Strummer, Sy Richardson, Dick Rude, Elvis Costello, The Pogues (all of 'em!), Courtney Love, Jim Jarmusch, Dennis Hopper, Xander R. Berkeley, and Grace Jones to others who you'll probably see in a Jim Jarmusch film or in Alex Cox's Sid & Nancy. The soundtrack is a pseudo-Western and Latin mixture of Pogues, Pray For Rain, and Joe Strummer, which works excellently in the film, as well as outside it.
Cult stars, guns, black humour, violence, coffee, and a surreal Italian Western setting is what's in store when you go ""Straight To Hell"". Hilarious!",1014163200,27,1818,4.867741935483871

1177271,4,6300176053,"DAY ONE - THE INTRO
Definitly one the most ill-received and underated movies of it's time. I first heard it was going to be realesed on DVD a couple months after the (awesome but lacking in the extra's) Repo Man Collector's Edition came out. I was excited, since all I had was the shoddy first edition VHS tape, which neither pan's or scans and just sits in the middle of the screen cutting off about 50% of every shot (not to mention the opening credits - for years I thought it was was called, RAIGHT TO HE)
DAY TWO - THE MOVIE
This is a movie for people who like movies out of the ordinary. Hell, this movie is just flat out fun to watch. I mean whats not to like; Senseless Violence, Schickzo Storeowners, Inept Hitmen, Even More Inept Gang Members, Cheesy One-Liners, Clever Swearing, Amazing Photography, Beautiful Set-Designs, Badass Acting, and the WIENER KID!. Not to mention Blood, Money, Coffee, Guns, and Sexual Tension. Reviewers slammed it hard when it first came out, hopefully this time they'll look at the movie for what it is and realize it's comedic genius, it's ground-breaking design, and it's overall greatness.
Oh yeah if you don't know the story it's basically this; three hitmen and an overly-annoying girl (played by pre-star, post-stripper, pre-plastic surgery-miracle, Courtney Love, in the only good thing she's ever done), who makes Nancy Spungeon look like Mother Teresa, blow a hit, rob a bank, and hide out in a small, desert town inhabited by a gang of coffee addicted outlaws named the McMahons, a killer caberet singer, a sadly misunderstood weiner kid, a bar keep who finally get's some business, a priest with more bullet belts than John Rambo, a crazy sadistic storeowner with a hot french wife, and the town butler who makes sure everyone has a fresh cup of coffee at all times, no matter the sercumstance.
DAY THREE - THE DVD
The picture and sound on this disc are going to get a 10 out of 10 no matter what, since all my tape does is skip and hiss. But the picture on this is excellent, as well as the color and contrast, it's like watching it in a theatre. The sound is clear as can be and it is presented in widescreen format at 1:85:1 ratio. The difference between this and the video is night and day.
There's only 3 extras one the disc but they are each interesting in their own right, I only wish they included some deleted scenes and onset (I think Anchor Bay is against this for some reason). First up, the Audio Commentary with Alex Cox and Dick Rude, not the most groundbreaking commentary but it is very funny and an interesting listen. They both joke on the movie, each other, and some of the cast. Also, you get to here some pretty cool stories about the filming and the people involved with the movie. Alex and Dick also teach an important life lesson, when in need of a comedic moment, just throwing a rock and hitting someone is a surefire way to get a laugh. Next is the very cool 20+ minute documentary called Back to Hell, in which they go and interview about 15 or so of the cast and crew and ask them some questions about the movie. Here, you get to here some hilarious stories (most of which involve the maming of Zander Schloss, who, by the way, finally hit puberty), there were parts in here that had me killing myself laughing. There's a couple of deleted scenes thrown in for good measure as well. Finally, there's a short video promo(for the studio who produced the movie, I presume) of the Pogues version of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly theme made up of clips from the movie and home video footage of the making of it.
My only complaint of the entire DVD is the cover.... uggghk. The thing looks like a grade 8 student who's project was to make a video cover using only Photoshop and a copy of Pulp Fiction. Personally they should have stuck with the original video cover of the Joe Strummer drawing with the town burning in the background. Which is sadly, nowhere to be found in the contents of the DVD, they do however include a tiny mediocre japanese poster featuring some of the cast members and the soundtrack (and original poster) artwork.

If your a fan of Alex Cox or a fan of cult cinema in general, I highly suggest you pick this up. If you have the old VHS version, toss it out (photocopy the cover first then glue in on the DVD case) and get this instead.",989625600,18,4368,4.468085106382978

Director Alex Cox who was actually at one time talented is in Colonel Kurtz mode here.  It's as though they gave a party for nihilists and forgot to let the audience in on the joke.  Nothing.  Zero. Nada.  This one is bereft of anything suggesting artistry.  Waste of time, brain cells, whatever.  Made me long for the Monkees'  ""Head"".

7902199,1,6300176053,"I was watching a documentary about spaghetti Westerns recently, and I saw Alex Cox being interviewed for it.  It jossled my memory and I remembered that Alex had made a ""western"" himself called Straight to Hell.  Cox loves spaghetti westerns, and is very enthusiastic in the documentary.  Unfortunately, this film shows that he can't make a spaghetti western to save his life.

This is one of the worst, most self indulgent films I've ever seen.  It's like Cox assembled a bunch of his friends and said ""hey, let's improvise a western on an old Sergio Leone set"", and that's pretty much what they did.  And the final result is AWFUL.  It seems that the cast (which is very good, including Dennis Hopper, Jim Jarmusch, Joe Strummer, Elvis Costello, and Grace Jones) and crew had a great time doing this, but when you see the final results, they are tremendously boring and self indulgent.  Leonard Maltin said this film had the air of a ""hip in-joke"", and he was right.  It's like Cox and his friends were too busy being too hip for their own good instead of making a good film.  Cox may like spaghetti Westerns, but he doesn't have the feel for the genre as a director.  He's no Leone or Corbucci, not even close.  Cox is a good filmmaker (Sid and Nancy and Repo Man are excellent films), but he just loses it here.  If you enjoy watching train wreck films, then you might want to check this out.  Otherwise, stay clear.",1264291200,3,1420,4.539370078740157
7902200,4,6300176053,"For die-hard Clash fans, rather for fans of the late 1970's English punk movement, this movie is hard to resist. An eclectic group of musicians and actors, including Joe Strummer, members of The Pogues, Dennis Hopper, Elvis Costello, and Jim Jarmusch, this homage to Spaghetti Westerns is wonderful.  If you get it.  For those who might necessarily appreciate the actors, the humor may be lost.

This project was director Alex Cox's immediate after Sid & Nancy, the story of Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious and his violent love affair with Nancy Spungen.  In fact, Courtney Love may have been channeling Nancy for her role in Straight to Hell.  She is the only truly bad addition to this movie.  Her annoying and insescent screaming was hard to get through at certain points.

Overall, if you have an appreciation for all of these personalities on one set, in one film, then it is well worth the purchasing price.",1171065600,3,913,4.814102564102564

I loved seeing Strummer playing a cool sexy guy, he had some great funny moments. Shane Macgowan made me crack up when ever he's on screen. I was also surprized to see some actors in it that are now recgnizable from their recent work like an actor from medium and one from 24.

7902202,5,6300176053,"Yup, this film--which happens to be one of my all-time faves--is not for everyone. Way back a bit before Sting and Bono gave a whole new meaning to the idea of pompous jerk, British punker musicians brought a real Midlands working class sense of irony and absurdity to the world--often not only through their music but through their stage chatter. Some of the flat-out funniest people I've ever encountered were punkers from the Eighties. The single-most un-funny human I've ever known was a major league grunge performer, and let's not even go near modern rappers and the whole EMO phenomenon. In other words, if you're a Post-Eighties kid this movie probably won't work well for you as you're probably soaked in earnest and dreary. A Brit recently told me that Americans have totally lost their sense of irony. There you have it.

The premise of this film was brilliant--let's take a bunch of Brit rockers to Spain (because a concert gig in Central America fell through), write a script in two days, and make a Spaghetti Western using a dilapidated old set from the early 70's. This couldn't happen today for a variety of reasons, one being that a bunch of musicians with any public reputation wouldn't put up with the lousy accommodations in order to have a bit of fun. Then there's that sense of humor thing again, I can't think of any performer today who could pull off what (just to give a few examples) Joe Strummer and all the Pogues do here. They probably lived on Pepsi and hot dogs for the three weeks it took to shoot this wonder, and they probably didn't give a hoot. And then again, this couldn't have happened back then with American punkers who tended to be snots. I think we stopped being funny a long time ago.

The pace is slow because the film does a great job of emulating its models; mainly those classic Clint Eastwood films. So there. However, it's beyond mere parody and there's plenty of terrific slapstick and just goofy humor all the way through the flick. It's one of those films where there are almost too many memorable vignettes--a bit where Strummer is in a clinch with a gal and his gun accidentally goes off and he has to fake having been bitten by a snake is, for me, one of the classic funny moments in film. The soundtrack alone (at least until kids who are easily bored started writing reviews for Amazon) was, for many years, considered to be classic. The, uh, ""violence"" is farcical and hardly graphic; also, to have fun, they scrupulously avoided obscenity and nudity in the film, which is what everybody expected from this gang. I understand it got an R rating almost by accident.

Anyway, I love Buster Keaton, the Marx Brothers, W.C. Fields, and all those screwball comedies of the 1930's and this film is one of my favorites. Elsewhere in Amazonia another youngster expresses her boredom over the Cary Grant collection that includes ""The Awful Truth""--a flick that rivals Shakespeare. Need I write more?

Some day, when all us tedious Americans who think humor is sadism, making fun of people, and/or doing disgusting things (the lowest forms of humor by the way) are all dead and gone, and the country is full of newcomers who can find genuine joy and laughter in things, this film will be regarded as a classic.

[Raegen Butcher down below gets it dead right by describing this film as a people-sorter in the manner of ""Big Trouble in Little China""--a gem that is for me up there with ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Citizen Kane."" I generally find that anyone who doesn't like ""Big Trouble"" or this flick puts ME to sleep in minutes. And while I'm at it, what's with these one-star reviews because something bores you? Everybody I know under the age of thirty these days is bored by anything that isn't exploding in their faces.
