The scenery was like the other DVDs - with cutting to different scenes. So far, I am looking forward to viewing the other two walks on the DVD.",1522540800,,305,4.1

It makes the time pass much faster and not near as tired when I'm finished.",1482624000,,149,4.0

8753377,5,B01CK3YEPQ,"Choice of 3 different walk/jog/runs through well-known areas of France.  What a unique way to get some exercise and see the world without ever leaving your home!  Extremely well done.  How they got such a smooth video while moving at this pace was intriguing!  Very good camera work.  Nice selection of parks, rivers, city scape and peeks of famous landmarks such as Notre Dame, the River Seine and the Eiffel Tower with real life sound tracks.  Highly recommend this DVD for in-home exercising!",1477094400,,495,4.903614457831325
8753378,3,B01CK3YEPQ,"I wanted more of Paris.  Having been to Paris, and experiencing the hustle/bustle of ""seeing the sights"" and shopping, I was expecting more of reliving that past experience from this video.  Not.  It is simply walking around in parks and on sidewalks near highways and some office buildings and apartments.  If you are expecting to experience shopping, cafes, highlights, places of interest, or nightlife, this is not the video. Some places of interest do appear from a distance. It is definitely for walking, not sightseeing.",1467504000,5,526,5.152941176470589

8753380,5,B01CK3YEPQ,Enchanting footage of Paris in brilliant full color with realistic sound.  It is as if you were actual strolling the streets enjoying the sites and sounds of romantic Paris.  There are three different walks from which to choose.  You can see all the beauty of Paris without leaving your home.  It is a  brisk walking pace in the first two videos.  The third is a bit slower.  Especially enjoyed the famous Paris landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame.  Gave my workout a little excitement.  High quality filming with no shaking camera.  Automatically loops for continuous workout.  Great for tread mill or stationary cycle workout.,1460332800,3,642,4.906542056074766
