Chris trains you in mental toughness, shows you how to push past pre-conceived limits, and gives you the tools to get into the best physical shape of your life.  This is the third in a series of fitness programs by a former SEAL Physical Fitness Instructor.  Recommend starting with his first program ""Navy Seal Workout Challenge"" and working up to ""The Final Challenge"".",1463356800,,430,4.783783783783784

7989872,5,B000096JHL,"This is a great workout for people who love a calisthenics/military type workout, i'd say its pretty challenging if you follow it right you will have done a good few hundred push ups (different varietys)a stack of pull ups, and a ton of abs/stetch's and leg work. I think the best things about this workout though is the guys sense of humour he's a real larger than life character and this makes it great fun, also the stretching is really good because its an area alot of regular exerciser's overlook.",1310428800,5,502,4.588888888888889
7989873,3,B000096JHL,"When I bought this video, I was looking for something that would really push me to my limits.  I wanted something that I probably would never have finished and walked away from.

C.J. Caracci spends way too much time talking and stretching. Although stretching is very important, it's kind of dumb when you do it after every exercise.  How are you supposed to get tired?  Anybody can do a lot of pushups for a very long time as long as they're allowed to stretch for about three minutes after about every 15 pushups.

Nevertheless, this video IS harder than any other fitness video I have ever seen.  This video makes Tae-Bo looks like child's play.

Just don't expect a true ""Navy SEAL"" workout. This is not even close to a real Navy SEAL workout.",1124755200,,748,4.537313432835821
