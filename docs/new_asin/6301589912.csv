8751599,5,6301589912,This is a very enjoyable and moving video of Maxim conducting his father's Symphony No. 5. What better authority than the composer's own son on how this monumental work should be performed. Highly recommended!,1273017600,,209,5.176470588235294
8751600,2,6301589912,"I like Victoria Mollova, but this tape contains something that should be seen perhaps for the musical terror. Shostakovich symphony 5, which is regarded as ""the greatest"" symphony of all Shostakovich's symphonies, is conducted by his son, Maxim Shostakovich, who should be arrested for what he did with his father's symphony on this tape. For a musician it is essencial to see this tape, for then one can know how a conductor can turn great music into terrifying embarrassment. For non-musicians, it provides at least some amount of fun to see Maxim jumping on the podium while conducting.  Poor Dimitri, thank god you're not here to see your son conducting your masterpiece.
