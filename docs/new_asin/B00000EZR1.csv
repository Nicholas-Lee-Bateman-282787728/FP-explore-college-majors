1199426,2,B00000EZR1,Opera d'Oro videos do not contain subtitles.  Most viewers will probably get lost unless they are very familiar with the libretto (and maybe know a bit of German).  I would suggest Levine's Metropolitan version of The Magic  Flute - it's an excellent performance and it has subtitles!,946857600,19,284,5.0
1199427,2,B00000EZR1,"This production was very well sung, but I found it rather dull.  I have seen numerous other productions of the Magic Flute, and this one just lacked the life that the others had.",942105600,5,178,4.393939393939394
1199428,4,B00000EZR1,This is a very decent production and well sung. But Opera d'Oro does not supply subtitles and that might be a bad drawback during the long passages of German dialogue.,920592000,9,167,4.6
7906029,3,B00000EZR1,"If you already have some performances of this opera in Europe,  this one is worth seeing as the special version.  It will be no woth comparing with other traditional performances.  What we shoud understand is that this opera is loved all over the world, and this is the one to see how this opera is cooked and arranged by Thai spices.  Just be relaxed to enjoy this performance, though there is some dissatisfaction in singing, ensamble or acting.  I should say they appointed thee boys, whose roles were sometimes performed by young ladies.  Though their singing is not good, but their
existence itself is important.
Anyone won't recommend this DVD as the first one.  I've already enjoyed many excellent performances in Europe and America, so this one is good
for me to understand the condition of music in Thailand, also I admit the greatness of  the opera again.",1478736000,,865,4.797297297297297

7906032,3,B00000EZR1,"Can`t really blame them, they did good. But, a few days later, we saw (live from Berlin), The Magic Flute performed by the Berliner Philharmoniker, conductor Simon Ratlle, with an outstanding cast. A sublime experience. The difference was obvious. )(",1365465600,,250,5.275
7906033,5,B00000EZR1,"I have seen a shortened version of this on Sky TV and as an avid Magic Flute fan with no fewer than 17 versions on DVD I was actually bowled over by this production.  It was refreshingly different and wonderfully way out!

Of course the singing cannot compare with many other versions, especiallt the classic Covent Garden and some of the European productions are also wonderful.  As for the three boys I steer you to the latest Harnencourt production, (the Queen of the Night comes out of a fridge for her second aria and her three ladies are blind!!!  BUT the three boys are phenominal and their quartet with Parmina when they persuade he not to kill herself is just sheer perfection.

However by the very nature of the opera itself and its wonderful ability to be interpreted in so many ways the three boys by necessity just have to be three boys (not wommen as in a few productions) and their vouoices though should be good it is their innocence and purity that play the important part in the story.

This production is so 'way out' it really does demand a place in the library and I will enjoy it for the sheer spectacle and wonder of it.

I tried to order it when I first saw it and was disappointed as I was told it was out of stock but now the order is supported by Amazon i am keeping my fingers crossed.  (It is the most expensive version I have bought so that should be recommendation in itself!",1273795200,,1406,4.360153256704981
7906034,5,B00000EZR1,"This was my first time seeing the Bangkok Opera, but I am sure it will not be my last. Magic Flute was an amusing rendition of Mozart's Magic Flute. The operatic is in German and the vocals are in English and Thai with English subtitles.

The opera runs 2.5 hours, so short by opera standards. While the top stars Nancy Yuen and Harold Gray Meers gave above average performances, the real stars were the co-stars. Queen of the Night, played by Sandra Partridge, gave the outstanding vocal of the performance which alone is worth the see and the price of the video. Her costume was a winner too. The performance by the Thai actor who portrayed Papageno really made the production memorable. I was really impressed by the performances of the ""demons"" Monostatos and Sarastro. These two performers were so devilishly charming!

I'd definitely recommend a viewing of this Mozart classic.",1250467200,5,883,4.841059602649007
7906035,1,B00000EZR1,"Wish we could be more encouraging about this review.  The Magic Flute is an opera that lends  itself well to varied interpretation and  a new one holds promise, but beware here.
The amateur singing in this performance should have ruled out its public release.. The singing ranges from actually shockingly bad (from the cute three boys) to better (from Monastatos).
The orchestra is fine, but not memorable by international opera standards. The career promise of the young Thai conductor  cannot be furthered by either  by the high-school level the singing or the staging. The set consisted throughout of what appeared to be three or so large pieces of Lego in primary colors.
Of two dozen dvds of this opera we purchased, this is the only one we ever sent back. Be warned -subtitles are lacking except when Papagano speaks in Thai.",1219968000,3,831,4.865248226950355
7906036,5,B00000EZR1,"This video is really quite good. It does not have subtitles, but I still love it. Actually it is a little good that it doesn't have subtitles, because if a video in another language does have subtitles, then you'd be looking at the subtitles the whole time instead of the movie. Horst Gebhart is a good Tomino,  & has a beautiful tenor voice.  Dieter Scholtz is a good Papagano, Has a good baritone voice,  is a great actor, & looks good for the part(even though he looks a little stout).  I really like the bass voice of Hermann Chistian Polster as Sarastro.  All of the rest of the cast is good. The only costumes that I don't like are the three laidies' costomes. They look like Japanese women with dyed hair, & green, or purple dresses. But don't let that discourage you out of getting this video.  You probably won't want this video if it is the first version you see, because it has no subtitles, but if you have seen others, or you speak a little German, then this is the version for you!  if you try to remember the translation from the Ingmar Bergman version, then you probably should get another version, because in the Bergman version, they cut out scenes, & the translation is different from the real thing.",972950400,16,1219,4.463963963963964
7906037,5,B00000EZR1,This is a beautiful production.  The sets are amazing and the cast is wonderful.  The Tamino is one of the best I have ever seen.  The only problem with this production is it has no subtitles.,952819200,10,192,4.277777777777778
