8189122,4,B000P5IW2I,"""On the Tracks of the Wild Otter"" is about the sea otters and other wildlife of Scotland's Shetland Islands.  This beautifully photographed film shows the beautiful scenery of Scotland with its birds and animals such as cormorants, loons, deer, and more.  Most of all, we see the rare and secretive lives of sea otters and their families, such playful and appealing creatures. By all means purchase it if you love wildlife documentaries.  The old episodes of Nature are well worth collecting even on VHS, and perhaps someday they will be released on DVD.",1212537600,,554,4.935483870967742
