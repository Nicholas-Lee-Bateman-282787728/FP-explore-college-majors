7938257,5,B00005IAQK,"One of my favorite Chow Yun-Fat comedies and further proof of what a great all
around actor he is.

This is one of his older movies but if you like it you should watch these ones also:

100 Ways to Murder your Wife
Fractured Follies
Spiritual Love
Diary of a Big Man",1427760000,,266,4.096153846153846
7938258,5,B00005IAQK,I'm glad I bought the DVD. Never get tired of watching Chow Yun-Fat & Carol 'DoDo' Cheng!!! They have an amazing and unbeatable chemistry. I still couldn't get over Man in the Net. Highly recommend watching it! You will laugh at Chow Yun-fat and Jacky Cheung,1421971200,,258,4.630434782608695
