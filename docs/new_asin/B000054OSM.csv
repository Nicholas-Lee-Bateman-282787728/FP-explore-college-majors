The writer and the director focussed on the core elements of the characters and the issues that haunted them. This is Grey at his best, unafraid to explore the darkness that existed in himself and transferred so well to his characters. The highbrow Boston socialite carrying her highbred pride into the New Mexican Border region near Douglas. Her first encounter is with a well bred cowboy Gene Stewart whose past is drowned in whisky. This novel portrayed attitudes held by Americans toward Mexicans, the abuse of power by the law and big business and the degrading influence of drink on susceptible personalities. Grey's embracing of Darwin shows in much of his work and none translated better than this to the big screen. For a ""B"" movie it gets high marks from this Grey fan. The Director did not blink.",1105833600,,970,4.678362573099415
