8181268,5,B000NTPCJW,"This review is based on what I remember from seeing Brass on TV many years ago (a British series, it's not available in a format compatible with US DVD players, and I haven't yet purchased the machine that will play it). But what a screamingly funny show, way ahead of its time for outrageousness (though delivered with subtlety), wit, and innuendo.  Great performances from a splendid cast.  A classic.",1369785600,,403,4.826086956521739
