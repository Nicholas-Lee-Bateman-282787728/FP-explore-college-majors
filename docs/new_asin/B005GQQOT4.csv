8472179,5,B005GQQOT4,"As usual, their perils keep me on edge. I love this show from the very beginning. Theirs is a divine fire that moves them away from the common Christian mode, into the trenches we only dream about.  They take risks for the advancement of the Kingdom. They will be even more rewarded in that day. I hope to witness them being acknowledged in that day.",1417219200,3,350,4.384615384615385

8472182,5,B005GQQOT4,"RAW  IMAGERY.....A mighty griping documentary. On january 12th 2010 at 5pm. A 7.0 Earthquake occured 16 miles from the capital PORT-AU -PRINCE HAITI. The earthquake was devastateing. Destroying the whole city, killing 230,000 people,and leaveing 1.5 million homeless. The beautiful presidental palace sufferd great damage.  And their magnifcent cathedral destroyed, with the Arch Bishop Dead... Miles of trenches were dug and bodies thrown in. Rubbish was also tipped into the trenches with them. The decomposed bodys were in a tangled mess, with Relatives not even knowing of their Fate.  Now starvation was beginning to set in, and looting began. The looters were shot. Even the Haiti Police had become corrupt. It was said that they were just as hungry and desperate as everyone eles was. The two young Missionary's  who were bravely makeing this documentary were also at great risk, with Riots all around them. Then gun shots were heard, and they had to run too, not knowing who had the gun. Dueing food distribution, hundreds of people were being crushed, many were missing out on food altogeather. As there just wasn't enough of it to go around. Everything was CHAOTIC everything was out of CONTROL.  With Riots, Hunger, and Homeless people. And with all they had been through, the haiti people never lost their  FAITH. Christian services were held on street corners.  They explained that someone was looking after them, as they didn't die too, Stating, they were the saved Ones.",1338336000,4,1485,5.1115702479338845
