2257564,3,B0008ENI2K,"I rented this film because it stars Lindsay Wagner, and I'm a huge fan of hers.  That said, this movie was just okay.  Wagner was wonderful as always, but the rest of the cast was stiff and the dialog stilted.  I doubt I'll watch it again, which is something I rarely say when it comes to a Wagner film.  Definitely don't see any need to own this one.",1344297600,,351,4.117647058823529

2257566,5,B0008ENI2K,"Lost in the Wild is based on a true story and I really enjoy watching Lindsay Wagner movies and TV series.  It was a bonus to have a young Jennifer Lopez in this movie as well as Lindsay Wagner.  It is a great movie of family relationships, dedication, and perseverance.  Lots of excitement too.",1310342400,2,295,4.425925925925926
2257567,3,B0008ENI2K,"First of all i've saw this movie yesterday under the name : LOST IN THE WILD which runs 2 minutes longer than Nurses on the Line: The Crash of Flight 7.this movie has potential because has good shots(was filmed in Mexico),very good cast,good soundtrack,interesting scenery but it had been more entertaining if it was an intersection between the drug dealer and the nurses and if it was a love story between the adventure.that's are my only discontent.robert loggia and jennifer lopez were awesome and the other cast too.i've read in other commentaries about this movie that jennifer lopez has a minor role but this is not true.if think that her real fans will enjoy her in this movie. She brings beauty and talent to this movie.i wanted her to speak more in spanish in this movie but are not so many ocasions into this movie for doing that.so all in all it is a pretty good movie that could have been a much better movie even a classic one if the story had been more intriguing.",1299369600,2,978,4.5625
2257568,2,B0008ENI2K,I don't know what came first whether it was Lost the TV series or this movie but neither appeal to me. Same predictable rubbish and music? Not for me. Regards Stewart. 27-05-10,1274832000,,176,4.53125
2257569,4,B0008ENI2K,"This is an early 1990s TV movie (hence, it's full screen).  It hits all the usual emotional buttons.

As four student nurses fly to a clinic in the Mexican jungle, along with some doctors, one of their three planes crashes.  The other two planes land.  Then the nurses and remaining doctors must find the group that went down, treat them, and arrange to fly them out to an advanced American hospital.

This film is full of cliches and stereotypes.  Poor but noble peasants who are honest and generous with their meager belongings rally to help the doctors who helped them.  Corrupt Mexican soldiers and government officials are callously indifferent to the doctors' plight.  Evil drug lords lurk menacingly in the jungle, posing a potential threat to the doctors.  Banditos rob the downed plane. Mexican-American student nurse Jennifer Lopez visits a local Catholic church, lighting a candle, to the warmly smiling approval of the poor villagers.

One patient ""dies.""  Two doctors declare him dead.  But a gutsy, spunky student nurse refuses to accept that, and she manages to revive the patient, proving herself smarter than the doctors!  (Give me a break!)

This is a predictable film, and hard to believe it's all true.  It's supposedly based on a true story, but I suspect they embellished heavily.

Still, it has many good actresses. Lindsay Wagner is the star; she plays an older student nurse who went back to college after divorcing her doctor-husband.  She worries that others think she's too old.  Farrah Forke is another nurse.  Some may remember her as ""Alex"" from the WINGS sitcom.  And it's always nice to see Jennifer Lopez.  She has a small cliched role as another nurse, one who ruminates about her Mexican roots (her poor peasant father had immigrated from Mexico, and she's the first of her family to go into medicine).

Contrary to the DVD cover, Jennifer Lopez's part is small.  Although this is an ensemble film, Lindsay Wagner is the lead star; Lopez is a minor supporting player.

An enjoyable TV movie, if you like the actresses and don't mind the cliches.",1186444800,14,2081,4.896848137535817
2257570,4,B0008ENI2K,"While heading towards a makeshift medical outpost deep into the Mexican jungle, one of three planes crashes, stranding a group of doctors and student nurses, some of whom are critically injured. This taut adventure follows the attempts of the others to locate the downed plane and save the lives of the survivors. Once the search party finds the injured medics, their next challenge is to get them to a proper medical facility. One in particular could die any moment. The searchers could have treated them on the spot had not local natives appeared and looted the downed plane of its drugs. A nearby landing strip promises a chance to get the injured passengers to safety, but unfortunately that would precipitate a night flight and recent anti-drug operations laws strictly prohibit flying after dark. One brave doctor volunteers to traverse the jungle to a nearby town in hopes of convincing authorities to make an exception. Meanwhile the rest of the entourage must somehow make it safely to the airstrip by daylight.",1120003200,9,1020,5.0058823529411764
