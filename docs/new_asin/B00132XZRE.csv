8602237,5,B00132XZRE,"I found this film to be full of good anthropological information about how the Wodaabe people live, work, eat, and dress.  It shows how their nomadic camps are arranged, water is drawn, cattle and camels are cared for, males are initiated into full fledged adulthood, and what body art practices are prevalent.  A large portion of the film is dedicated to the first day of a beauty competition called the Gerewol festival among the young men.  The make-up, costumes, jewelry, and dances are all beautifully filmed, and fascinating to watch.  This film was a pleasure to view: interesting and educational.",1214956800,5,604,5.01
