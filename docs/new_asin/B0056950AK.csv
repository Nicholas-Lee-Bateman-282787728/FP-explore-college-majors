4587657,5,B0056950AK,"I have had the privilege of viewing ""REBIRTH"" in pre-release.  It is an emotionally strenuous film, but it should be nothing less.  Any American should see this film to remember why the events of the last 10 years have changed us forever.  Jim Whitaker did nothing less than a masterful job of creating astonishing time-lapse camera visuals of Ground Zero, but it is his interview with five victims of the attacks over the decade following Sept. 9, 2001, that make this documentary a must-see for any of us who thinks for a moment that this nation isn't worth treasuring, loving, and protecting--or, simply for anyone who has ever felt lost and without hope. If these survivors can rebuild their lives, anybody can.",1314835200,5,715,4.844262295081967
4587658,5,B0056950AK,"Whether you lost someone close to you or not on September 11, 2001 you definitely felt the blow that's endured the past decade. This film only follows five of those stories, but the moments of strength and weakness those five people have been through have been felt by all of us in some way. There is also a lot of incredible time-lapse footage chronicling the REBIRTH of ground zero. See this film for yourself - you'll really appreciate what Jim Whitaker has done to help us all move on.",1312329600,10,489,4.50561797752809
4587659,5,B0056950AK,I was required to watch this for a class (Grief Counseling). Of course it was fantastic and really opened my eyes to the processes of grief. I was able to see several patters and connect concepts learned in class to the very real individuals interviewed in the film. You hurt for them as they get worse and you are thrilled for them as they find joy.,1388966400,2,350,4.318181818181818
4587660,5,B0056950AK,"This documentary was done so well considering the subject matter...survivors of the 9/11 attack in NYC.  The documentary follows the lives of 5 people and how their life stories unfold over the next 10 years.  The film spends time with each of them and how they coped with such a horrible tragedy and loss of a loved one.  Over the time span of 10 years it also shows how they started to heal, rebuild and live again.",1353974400,2,417,4.3896103896103895
4587661,5,B0056950AK,"This movie gives hope for post traumatic stress survivors, and shows how time really does heal us all. Wonderfully inspiring.",1343952000,,125,5.3
4587662,5,B0056950AK,"Rebirth is a really emotional documentary about five people who are directly affected by the 9/11 tragedy and throughout a 10-year period -with each year that passes- we find out how they've learned to cope with their own personal tragedy that either involved them or a close family member from the World Trade Center buildings.

The film focuses almost entirely around the people sitting in a room and a dark background setting and revealing their tragic story in the most honest and tear-shedding way imaginable.  What makes this documentary different from most is the way we can actually *see* the changes with every year that passes and how these people have grown, not just older, but stronger.  How they've learned to adapt over time without their loved ones around.  How they've learned to recover from the injuries they had to suffer.  How they've questioned their decisions over the years and wondered if their loved ones would have approved.  How they've responded, how they feel, how they've moved on, etc.  Watching the transformations of these five people is just extraordinary and it's impossible not to get teary-eyed from time to time.  As silly as it sounds, it makes me proud to be an American.  It means I'm associated with strong-minded people that have the ability to fight from the inside.

I can't pick which one of the five people shared the most interesting story because the point here is not to make story comparisons but rather to show the 9/11 tragedy from different peoples perspectives so you get an idea how horrific that day was and what the after effects were like.

A movie like this really shows how messed up the whole 9/11 incident was.  I remember the day it happened and how I was totally shocked witnessing the events in front of my television screen.  Watching the second tower fall... just about floored me.  I never want to see anything like that again.  It was almost something out of a movie, but I can only imagine how the sadness I felt was increased by a million concerning the people who were actually there.

I recommend Rebirth to everybody.",1336348800,,2093,4.788300835654596
4587663,5,B0056950AK,"""Rebirth"" is about the nine years of healing following Sept. 11, 2001, for five New Yorkers.  Each of these individuals tells a different story, and the film follows their progress as they come to terms with the tragedy.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is struggling to recover from the death of a friend, a lover, a family member, or who has almost died himself of injuries in a bad accident or attack.  The truth is that it takes years to recover from a tragedy as bad as 9/11, and not everyone deals with it the same way.  But there is hope.",1331596800,2,556,4.3173076923076925
4587664,5,B0056950AK,"This documentary truly gives you hope to keep moving forward when you think you can't continue.  Grief and loss is so unique and to see true survivors make the journey and come through to the other side of the most tragic event is inspiring and should give hope to anyone viewing this piece.  Despite such loss, life continues and can still bring joy despite such pain.",1318896000,,369,4.575757575757576
4587665,5,B0056950AK,"Until today, I haven't watched any movies about 9/11, I haven't felt emotionally ready. In Rebirth, I was taken on a journey with five people who lost loved ones, or were injured, on that day.  Their struggles and grief were so honest, it truly touched my heart.  Best of all, we see how they survive and begin to feel hope and joy again.  Thank you to everyone who had a part in making this documentary.",1315785600,3,404,4.36
4587666,5,B0056950AK,"I just saw this documentary at my University today, it was amazing!  I loved it, it was so moving, and really shows the strength of America.  It follows five people and their struggles with the aftermath of their tradgedy and how they coped and dealt with their pain.  I really makes me appreciate what I have in life, and cherish the time I have.  I would definitely reccomend it to anyone who wishes to fully understand the effect that 9/11 has on America and those who still suffer. Rebirth is also a movie of hope; it demonstrates that America can conquer anything, foreign or domestic.",1315699200,,590,4.59047619047619
4587667,5,B0056950AK,"Beyond moving documentary on the evolution of five people who lives were forever changed after 9/11. We are reminded that courage remains in those left behind and that as time and life goes on, and it does, the pain of loss does not lessen. The strength of their spirit and love of those lost just enables them function day by day despite the pain. You will cry for them and with them as you hear their stories of struggle to just live each day. This film is an honor to all survivors of the day we will NEVER forget.",1315440000,2,517,4.232323232323233

8459302,5,B0056950AK,I first watched this documentary a couple of months after my husband died in 2011 & cannot stress just how much this has the potential to help anyone struggling with profound grief. Although I lost my husband to cancer I was suffering from the same terrible shock & grief as the woman who lost her firefighter fiance. To watch her rebuild her life over the years that the documentary covers offers an incredible message of hope at a time when you're incapable of absorbing information from books etc. I have given the DVD to & recommended it to numerous young widows & widowers since then.,1512432000,,589,4.619047619047619
8459303,5,B0056950AK,"In my opinion this is the BEST follow up to 9/11 movie made!  I've had to have watched it 8 times and i've been moved every time.  So so well done, so informative.
EXCELLANT!!!!
I've come to love these people so much I would love another follow up to see how they all are.",1496275200,,272,4.018518518518518

8459306,5,B0056950AK,The most incredible 9/11 documentary out there <3,1473638400,,49,5.25
8459307,5,B0056950AK,"It's by far the most poignant documentary about September 11 I've seen, not only for its stunning cinematography and musical score, but for the candor of its subjects who had the courage to share the enormous scope of their grief in the immediate aftermath as well as the years of emotional and physical healing that followed. I appreciate the tremendous amount of dedication the director and participants gave to this project so that people could connect with them and learn more about the grief and healing in our own lives. It's breathtaking literally from start to finish.",1473206400,,576,4.948453608247423
8459308,5,B0056950AK,This documentary had me all torn up for weeks. To see the personal stories was so profound. Of course 9/11 struck everyone hard but to hear the stories from people who lost a loved one on 9/11 really puts things in perspective.  Incredible documentary. I could watch it 100 times. I've probably seen it at least 5 times by now.,1449705600,,327,4.45

8459311,4,B0056950AK,"Very enlightening and inspiring. I think a little bit more footage of the damage would have been a nice aspect to add to the video to show not just the emotional damage (as demonstrated by the people in the film), but also the physical damage to the area around it and how it changed the Financial District forever. Nice array of stories though.",1406419200,,345,4.492063492063492
