2293454,5,B0009IXRIU,"This is a wonderful Biography production, drawing upon a number of impressive Adams scholars and modern politicians (including David McCullough, Adams' most famous biographer; Joseph Ellis, author of  Founding Brothers; a couple of Adams' descendants; and President George H.W. Bush).  Not only does it tell the story of a vastly underappreciated Founding Father, it lauds his wife as an equal and contributing patriot in her own right.  The story of John and Abigail Adams is really a unique one in American history; it is a great love story on two counts - love for one another and love for country.  The production probably goes a little bit too far when it seems to imply that the Revolution may not have happened had John not met Abigail, but it does do a great service in righting the wrong that has all but expunged John Adams' name from the story of the Revolution.  Today, he is remembered as the second President of the United States, and a rather poor one at that.  Adams was clearly a very stubborn man, and his uncompromising insistence on doing what he thought was right did not make any friends among the politicians in Congress.  Worst of all, he signed the Alien & Sedition Act (partly, this video suggests, at the urging of his wife who was tired of seeing him pilloried in the press), and this dangerous infringement on the rights of a free press has left a pretty dark stain on his record.

Most of this video deals with Adams' life before he took government office, and it does a superb job of educating viewers as to Adams' integral role in the fight for independence.  After covering his early, Puritan upbringing, the story takes us through Adams' early life of self-doubt, his marriage to a woman that erased all those doubts, and his rise from a small-town lawyer to a leading voice on behalf of independence and revolution.  Significant time is spent on his years away from home - first in Philadelphia at the Continental Congress and later in Europe on diplomatic missions.  Abigail was left to oversee the farm, raise and teach the children, and watch out for British soldiers.  Rather than run and hide, she boldly watched the events going on around her, including the Battle for Bunker Hill itself, reported all of her observations to her husband, and in a real sense served as ""the eyes of the Revolution"" to the delegates at the first Continental Congress.  Husband and wife wrote voluminous love letters to one another throughout their many hard months apart, and one marvels at the intelligence, mental fortitude, and patriotic courage of Abigail.  She knew her countrymen needed John Adams, even when she was pregnant with her sixth child, and she was the rock who encouraged and enabled him to always do his duty and serve his fellow man.

Had John Adams never taken up politics in the new American republic, his legacy might be much weightier than it is today.  His speech to the Continental Congress on July 1, 1776 helped rouse the delegates to finally vote for independence the following day; his constitution for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (which he wrote in one week) was an obvious precursor of the U.S. Constitution that came ten years later; and he was there in Paris beside Ben Franklin when the Treaty of Paris was signed to end the Revolutionary War.  Looking back at my early school years, I can hardly recall John Adams' name even being mentioned alongside the likes of Washington, Jefferson, and Madison in discussions of the roots of American independence.  If more Americans could see this video, Adams' greatest claim to fame would no longer be the timing of his death (hours after Thomas Jefferson's, both on the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence) - it would be his life, for he and Abigail were true American patriots of the highest order.",1129766400,24,3836,4.786363636363636

8061568,5,B0009IXRIU,"This is an excellent title from the vast library of Biography titles, aired over the couse of several years.  Evidently, A&E has enough titles that there is now a Biography Channel on the digital cable tier of channels.  Most of these titles have been superb & this title is no exception.  It is a concise program highlighting the lives of the Adams, the family of which two Presidents of the United States came.  I remember viewing this title when it was aired & enjoyed re-watching it just as much as the first time!  The advantage of viewing it this way is no commercials!

If you want a concise look at the lives of these folks, definatly, get this title!  If a school student is needing a reference fora class paper, this would be one such reference.

There is nothing I wanted to know before purchasing this product, as I had seen the program previously.  It was the very inexpensive price that finally ""sold"" me",1256688000,,918,4.548780487804878
