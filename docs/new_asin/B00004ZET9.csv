8365575,4,B00004ZET9,"I am a very enthusiastic Bob Hope fan, and ordered this set to see what movies were included in the set.  Let me help you out. This set has 5 very good movies:  1)Road to Rio 2)The Great Lover 3)Son of Paleface 4)Paris Holiday 5)The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell.  All of these movies are good, my favorite being Road to Rio, one of the great early Bing Crosby & Bob Hope road films.  The set contains movies that are, I think, available elsewhere, however.  Still, if you are a collector of Hope's wonderfully funny films, check this set out.  Check the Internet Movie Database for movie reviews of these 5 films.",976838400,3,615,4.446428571428571
