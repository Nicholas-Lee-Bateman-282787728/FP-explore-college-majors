3788234,4,B001T6OPBE,It was a pretty good movie. It would have been better if the ending was different. It definitley showed how money changes people and the way one will act towards the BFF.,1361232000,,170,4.34375

3788236,1,B001T6OPBE,"Me and a couple of my peeps just happen to catch this movie during as it was playing. We was like what the f@#$!!?!?! Is this a porn? Then we saw some of the chicks and the settings....Somebody said this place is in some ghetto backwards A$$ town in south Carolina... Maybe in Decatur ga. Sure enough thats where it was. My boy stated he might even know some of the chicks in this video.
 You ever seen a movie soo bad it was good? This aint one of 'em. The acting is poor, the lighting is terrible. These chicks took two steps forward, eleven steps back in their actig careers. This movie is an embarrassment to African American women....waitaminute i mean all women....everywhere.
 Actually its so bad its laughable. (see plan 9 from outer space)

And thats why you have to see it. And  its over TWO HOURS LONG!!!!!!!!!
 By the way this is not the worst African American movie ever made RAP WAR ONE is.
 My advice to the director is this. Side peices and family members cant make a great movie .Unless you uncle is Samuel Jackson.
To the Ladies in this flick,you are Beautiful....with the exception  you three are barely c cups(see cover picture). Take my advice.. GET IMPLANTS AND TAKE ACTING CLASSES NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1246406400,,1234,4.63302752293578
3788237,5,B001T6OPBE,"I saw the premier, and this movie is really good. Lots of violence, but good. I recommend that people see this movie. Even though its 3 girls, this is not a Charlie's Angels remake. Big ups to my cousin Onira Tares, one of the main headliners. A must see! Shot on location, in Atlanta, Georgia.",1242172800,,294,4.363636363636363
3788238,3,B001T6OPBE,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. There are three girls who are friends and all seem to have financial problems. One of them is in an abusive relationship.

2. They come up with the bright idea of drugging and stealing money from men who want sex (the girls are all three very attractive).

3. Eventually, they rob a man who works for some big kingpin who makes money doing Some Illegal Thing (not specified, as it was not really relevant to the plot).

4. Later, it turns out that the man who was robbed (for something like $100,000) got killed by the Kingpin and set in motion the Kingpin's wanting to find out who was doing the robberies on his territory. The Kingpin then offers the girls a deal: 60% of their future earnings, plus all the money that they stole from his guy on the ground in exchange for their lives and those of their families.

5. One of the girls becomes a drug addict (and kills the Abusive Boyfriend of one of the other girls-- as a result of the Abusive Boyfriend beating the girl into a coma)and the other becomes a Christian.

6. Eventually, they kill the Big Bad Kingpin and the drug addict girl is killed, along with the mother of one of the girls. It is at this point that we find out that: A) One of the minor characters is really a crook himself; B) That the girl whose mother died was conceived of a rape; C) That one of the men who were robbed was killed by the drug addict girl.

Comments:

1. The acting in this movie was really pretty corny/bad. (I guess you can't find women that are that attractive and still expect them to be good actresses. That goes a long way toward explaining the career of people like Vivica A. Fox.)

2. The cinematography also left a lot to be desired.

3. The plot was fairly involved and well thought out. There were lots of devices in the movie to keep the viewer's attention and it shows that care was put into creation of said devices.

4. This movie could have been really good if the script was sold to someone who had the funds to hire a director.

Overall, it was OK for what it was. It's worth a rental after it gets off the New Releases shelf.",1242086400,4,2120,4.285714285714286

8340705,4,B001T6OPBE,it was amusing. The girl who was leading the whole thing acted beautifully and the man who was the gang boss and people who were working with him were terrible . The need to work as a boss boy instead of acting !!!!!,1515801600,,216,4.046511627906977

8340708,4,B001T6OPBE,I liked this movie.  Keep in mind it's a low budget movie.  I was in the mood to watch something on my computer and it kept me entertained.  I thought the acting was OK.  You can just tell it is low budget.  If you took the same movie and put in a lot of stars and different cameras etc. it could have been a better film.  It did keep me thinking and that's what a good story does.,1509148800,,381,3.8205128205128207
