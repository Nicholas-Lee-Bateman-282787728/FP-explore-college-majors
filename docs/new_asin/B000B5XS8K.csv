8081901,3,B000B5XS8K,"The riding stunts in this video are 80% illegal. They are COOL, and there are some great looking girls, but NO nudity. 5 star riding, action, comedy, and girls. BUT the camera work SUCKS its shaky 90% of the time. Films like that get me dizzy. But if bad recording does not bother you then this is the film for you.",1307145600,,315,4.180327868852459
8081902,5,B000B5XS8K,"Video is entertaining and full of squidy things. If you buy this, don't feel pity for the guys that eat Sh!# and get laid out because of injuries. If you do these stunts wearing shorts and tee shirts for your protection, you'll get messed up bad.
That said, Cool video. Hot chicks! :)",1305244800,,284,4.377358490566038
8081903,5,B000B5XS8K,"THIS REMINDS ME OF JUST RIDING WITH YOUR BOYS, ACTING THE FOOL, HOTEL PARTIES, AND OFCOURSE RUN INS WITH THE COPS. I LOVE THIS DVD AND HAVE WATCHED IT MANY TIMES, GOOD STUNTS, GOOD ACCIDENTS, AND GOOD COMEDY(WHICH IS A NICE CHANGE FROM THE SAME OLD STUNT DVDS)THIS DVD ALSO HAS THE SEXIEST CHICKS I'VE EVER SEEN ON A STUNT DVD. 5 STARS.",1258675200,,336,4.349206349206349
8081904,5,B000B5XS8K,"I highly recommend it! It's non-stop action! It's your typical sex, drugs, violence, and rock movie that most straight teenage boys and young men love to watch over and over again. The sex is young girls half naked flirting to the camera. The sex too is the motorcycle itself-these guys just can't stop having a wild and dangerous time on these machines. Like drugs they keeping getting their fix off of doing dangerous stunts. Add rock music and you have the most intense, hardcore motorcycle stunt move ever made. The movie should be called ""Testosterone Crew"" instead because these guys are crazy!

Don't do these crazy stunts! As a grown man who rode motorcycles for 12 years, I know that you will die if you do it. These guys are nothing but boys who are thinking from below their belts. There testosterone levels are so high that they are simply expressing what they feel inside and there's nothing wrong with that but they're doing it in a way that will kill them.  The girls, like most girls their age, are using sex to get love and attention. If any of these kids are my own, I would have stopped them and give them a huge lecture on respecting their lives and their own bodies. Any responsible adult will do this. Don't get me wrong. I love this movie and I highly recommend it to all my friends.",1255478400,,1306,4.506329113924051
8081905,4,B000B5XS8K,Without giving away too much there are a lot of wheelies and endos. Don't be fooled not many hot chicks. Director's commentary is f-ing hilarious! With a few exceptions it is a classic fun for the whole family.,1152489600,,210,4.552631578947368
8081906,5,B000B5XS8K,"I met Ken Kelley , in Ocean City,MD, at the OC Car Show.  He tried to influence me to buy the DVD.  I eventually got it, and laughed really hard. The parodies on it are of there own brand of humor. You could compare, but thats stupid.  Get it, and you'll see what I'm talking about. I actually remember them shooting this one scene, where they were in Ocean city, and picked up a stop sign and started walking across the street all while the car show was going on .  I thought they were playing around when they were doing it,cause someone had a camcorder going.  I had no idea it would end up on a DVD. There was a whole bunch of people laughing really hard at the show, cause the Ocean City police pulled up.  If you are into Jackass, CKY, or Street bikes doing stunts, an pulling tricks then you will definitely laugh if you purchase this , and watch it. Its all them combined, with a bunch of original humor you will not find elsewhere.",1145750400,,940,4.194444444444445
8081907,3,B000B5XS8K,"This video is pretty similar to other stunt documentaries out there, a few tricks in here that i haven't seen on any other dvd..

Overall very entertaining........",1140652800,,163,5.037037037037037
8081908,5,B000B5XS8K,"This DVD is insane! Street motorcycle stunting, fireworks, an OCC Parody, the craziest wreck I've ever seen (and the before and after to back it up!), Jackass/CKY style skits, Worlds Wildest Police Chases Parody, tons of bonus scenes and outtakes - definitely a must buy for anyone into street bikes, jackass type humor, or just good entertainment in general
