7971729,4,B00006LPF3,"This is good old fashioned family entertainment - about Annie, who acts as a kind of sheriff's deputy, plus her kid brother Tagg, working with the actual deputy Sheriff Lofty to solve cases.  I like that Annie only uses her gun when necessary, and usually just to shoot a weapon away, or to knock a prop onto the bad guy.  It's more about Annie solving cases using her smarts.  Gail Davis, who is really petite, appears to do a lot of her own stunts and is really impressive as Annie - she makes the show work!

The video quality is quite good for a TV show from the 50's - I would say very watchable.  Sometimes you can see dirt on the edge of the frame, and one episode here has some splices.  This damaged episode only runs for about 24 minutes and in one of the splices, someone put in the title sequence from a completely different show (20th Century Fox Hour's ""End of a Gun"", written by Sam Peckinpah), apparently to fill in a damaged print.  Fortunately, the ending credits are correct, so you can identify the episode as ""Indian Justice"".  The other episodes run for 25 minutes or more and appear to be complete.  My main complaint is that the episodes in these volumes are not compiled in broadcast order, and don't have the date identified.  ""Valley of the Shadows"" is from season one (1954), while the other three episodes on this disc (""Indian Justice"", ""The Mississippi Kid"", ""The Reckless Press"") are from season three (1956).  See epguides website for a list of Annie Oakley episodes and air dates. All episodes were in B&W, in case you were wondering.

Do not be put off by the damaged print on the one episode, if you are interested in this show, I think you will be satisfied by the quality of this release by Alpha Video.",1391558400,,1741,4.457413249211356
7971730,5,B00006LPF3,"When I first heard about episodes of this TV series on DVD, I was a little skeptical.  TV shows from the 1950s never made much sense to me.  But when I bought other DVDs of this show and watched them, I was hooked.  The episodes on this DVD are no exception.  They're full of so much action and excitement.  It's a shame they don't make shows like ""Annie Oakley"" anymore.",1226620800,,371,4.242857142857143

Everything about the production and marketing of this DVD is of high quality, which means you really get a lot for your money.
However there are no subtitles for the hearing impaired or for any foreign languages, but then again you rarely do for any vintage or classic TV Show!
The Main Menu has access to a very extensive catalogue listing, as well a previews of other titles available from Alpha Video Classics.
This is most probably why there are only 4 episodes per disc in this five disc collection.
The picture quality is excellent throughout each episode, as they really did a good job on lighting every scene in those days, so all indoor scenes and outdoor shady scenes are viewable, and the fast paced action scenes are of top quality.
These horse riding and shooting scenes are always a real treat, and would be just as exciting for the young ones today as they were for the young ones back in the 50's, 60's and 70's.
The sound quality is excellent also!
I have watched every episode on all 5 volumes of this collection, and there is absolutely NO fault in picture or sound on any episode, which helps make this series on sale most enjoyable to sit back with the entire family and relive the old days of television.
In case you are wondering each episode has the Annie Oakley Signature Intro and credits, with Annie doing her world famous stunts and shooting a neat hole in the centre spade of a nine of spades playing card being held up by Lofty, while Annie is standing upright on the saddle on Target her trusty Palomino, who is racing past Lofty at high speed!
You just can't get anything better than that!
What a Gal!
I loved this series when I was a kid.
I have lived in Australia all my life.
I was born in 1954.
Back in the 1960's we were inundated with great TV Westerns from the US, and Annie Oakley is one of the best!

7971732,5,B00006LPF3,"If you are considering ordering this dvd, then you no doubt remember the TV show with fond, albeit, fading memories, so I will not bother you with explainations regarding the premise of the series.  I will, however, praise VCI Entertainment for an excellent job on transference to dvd, for when compared to Alpha Video's inferior quality, the Annie Oakley TV Collection dvds are perfect and I highly recommend them.  The menus allow you to pick and choose which episodes to watch which include all of the opening and closing sequences.  These dvds are enjoyable to watch and would be a fine addition to your classic tv collection, and at a great price.",1188691200,8,652,4.803571428571429
7971733,5,B00006LPF3,"I have always loved Annie Oakley and Gail Davis was perfect for the part. This disk contains 4 episodes which contrary to comments of the first reviewer are very nicely done.

All four episodes are in great shape and watching them brought back my childhood. Annie is a superb roll model for little girls. Mothers should buy this DVD for their daughters.

Certainly this Series has far more merit than many of the current junk films that Hollywood puts out.

Marengo Films has done a nice job and I consider this DVD a bargain.",1115164800,10,526,4.574468085106383
7971734,2,B00006LPF3,"After having purchased the VCI Set of Annie Oakley episodes, and being very disappointed in the transfer quality (due to problems with the brightness level), I decided to give the Marengo Films DVD a try. This is in spite of the fact that it only included 4 episodes, compared to VCI's TWELVE! Given that it had the Davis family stamp of approval, I figured it to be a safe bet.

How disappointed to receive the DVD and find first off, that the opening sequence had been deleted off of each episode!!!!!!!

While the brightness level is better than the VCI set, the picture is still riddled with grain.

For the price, and given the number of episodes, this is a huge rip-off.

This is a classic children's western, and I am really disappointed that I can't get a quality set of episodes, as is available with many other shows. Frankly, until I read of another studio doing something along those lines, and that the transfers are good, I will quit attempting to add this classic to my DVD collection.",1099094400,13,1000,4.569832402234637
