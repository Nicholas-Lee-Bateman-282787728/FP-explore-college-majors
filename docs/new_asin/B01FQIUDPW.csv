7751281,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Marta Dusselldorp is one of the greatest actresses working today. Her work in Janet King should win her a Golden Globe Award for Actress in a limited series. This is smart, intelligent, well written and produced television.",1472688000,,223,5.054054054054054
7751282,3,B01FQIUDPW,Regarding this and season one. I find the characters to be to disfunctional and shallow and difficult to learn about and to identify with - to like. The Janet personal sceens are to many and each too long. I hope it gets better.,1472601600,4,228,4.325581395348837
7751283,4,B01FQIUDPW,A very well done series,1468627200,3,23,3.8
7751284,4,B01FQIUDPW,"Is there anything Marta s not in? Happily, she seems to have the knack of accepting some excellent roles and this series is her stand-out work. In Season 2 she is selected to run a Royal Commission into western suburbs gun crime, a subject that has a particularly painful relevance for her. Her investigation has plenty of twists and is helped by many of the stalwarts from Season 1 and before that, Crownies.
It must be said that there are perhaps a few too many coincidental relationship connections (which I thought undid the promising Crownies) but these are not overplayed fatally. Indeed, as intended, they add interest to the drama and provide some great red herrings. The drama is tightly scripted and quite gritty in spots. You might well predict one or two things but there are plenty of unexpected developments. There are very healthy servings of excitement and real tension. This is a really well filmed and scripted show. It is one of the best things on Australian TV at the moment. 4 1/2 stars!",1463702400,6,1008,4.732954545454546

7751321,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Janet King, Series 2: The Invisible Wound. In this Australian television series, a courtroom drama/mystery/thriller, the brilliant Janet King, played by award-winning actress Marta Dusseldorp (A PLACE TO CALL HOME, JACK IRISH) returns from maternity leave to her post as senior crown prosecutor, or Crownie. Mind you, the unsolved murder of her lesbian partner Ash two years earlier still weighs heavily on her consciousness. But her professional life is challenging, as the attorney general asks Janet to head a royal commission into serious firearm crime.

The Royal Commission, unlike the Department of Public Prosecutions, (DPP), her previous employer, allows Janet and her team to become the investigators.  From her former shop, the DPP, Janet conscripts solicitors Lina Badir (Andrea Demetriades), Richard Stirling (Hamish Michael), the ambitious Owen Mitchell (Damian Walshe-Howling) as Counsel Assisting, and Detective Inspector Andy Campbell (Christopher Morris) as Police Liaison.  Janet might  almost seem to be queen of all she surveys in this crime drama as she and her employees can raid, interrogate and request the secondment of police to aid their endeavors. They begin to peel back the complex layers of intrigue underpinning the illicit trade in weapons: Janets people discover evidence relating to Ashs murder.  Criminal and political forces begin to stir, bent on shutting them down, even if it means destroying Janet in the process.  Meanwhile, Janet personally faces  legal proceedings that tear at the invisible, unhealed wound of her previous relationship with Ash.

The boxed DVD set, which I received for purposes of review without bias, consists of three discs running approximately 463 minutes.  The story is told in eight continuous episodes.  There are, of course, some sexual situations, violence, and vulgar language: how could there not be? There is a 35-minute behind-the-scenes featurette and a photo gallery.  And subtitles, thank goodness, for those of us not familiar with Oz speak. The series is set in the city of Sydney, which looks intriguing. The sophisticated scripts are first-rate, as is direction. The tension is ratcheted up, the screws turned; the viewer is presented with twist after twist, until Kings situation is almost unbearable. And the acting, ah, the acting, is uniformly superb. As the title character, Dusseldorp is without peer. She always plays intelligent, but she can run through most of the emotions as well. She carries JANET KING manfully; similarly carries A PLACE TO CALL HOME, co-carries, with Guy Pearce, JACK IRISH. In fact, I think she acts as well, if not better, than that trio of blond actresses about her age that Australia gave to Hollywood: Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett, Naomi Watts. All of whom have become reigning Queens of tinsel town.  But Dusseldorp is both King and Queen in this one. Hope they can keep her Down Under.",1478908800,,2908,5.32532751091703
7751322,1,B01FQIUDPW,"On disc two of this series instead of being able to watch episode 6, The Thaw, the previous episode was repeated. I hope no one else received a faulty disc.",1478476800,,156,4.233333333333333
7751323,5,B01FQIUDPW,One of the best series I've seen in a long time.  Marta Dusseldorp is excellent in whatever she does.,1478476800,,101,4.315789473684211
7751324,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Superb series. Very well written, believable cliff-hangars every hour, a legal ""whodunit"" that keeps you guessing to the last episode, and wonderful actors all round. I thought Season 1 was great but think Season 2 is even better. Became a fan of Marta Dusseldorp's from A PLACE TO CALL HOME (another marvelous Australian series.) She is just wonderful in this as the smart, razor sharp, ""ice queen"" Janet King.",1477180800,2,411,4.971014492753623
7751325,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Janet King is an Australian TV series featuring a Senior Crown Prosecutor, Janet King. She is played by Marta Dusseldorp, and she has been featured in several tv series. In this series she is the main lead, playing a gay prosecutor. She has had twins with her partner, Ashe, who was a stay at  home mom, but was killed in the first series. This series 2, has Janet King trying to recover from the murder of her partner.

Also, in Series Two the Attorney General has asked Janet to head up a Royal Commission into a recent series of shootings in Sydney. Janet brings in her team of lawyers and police, many who are known to S from Season One.

This is a tough commission, and everything is on the line. The other lawyers and characters are well characterized and very interesting people. There are areas where these young lawyers are allowed to stumble, and we are there with them.  The families lives are showcased. Beside the story of the illegal guns and murders, Janet King is still trying to find the murderer of her partner. Ofamily issues are brought to the fore, and not much seems to be as it appears.

On MHz which is how I watched the series, one episode a week was revealed. Marta Dsseldorf is such an excellent actress. All of her emotions can be seen within her facial expressions.  This is a series that grabbed me at the start. Excellent writing and the acting is superb

7751326,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Complex characters, red herrings, well written story lines quite different from American crime/police dramas/procedurals, all set in Australia, JK1and JK2 are well worth the time to watch. Marta Dusseldorp (A Place to Call Home), is one of AU's finest actors. I hope there will be a Season 3, 4, 5, etc.",1476748800,,303,4.96078431372549

7751328,5,B01FQIUDPW,"This is a well done legal drama from Australia.  I like that they changed locations for season 2.  The acting is top rate, as is the story line.  I don't mind that Acorn releases these news programs weekly.  There is so much to watch on Acorn and Amazon Prime that not having to binge watch a program.",1476230400,,301,4.228070175438597
7751329,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Janet King, Senior Prosecutor, is tapped to lead an Australian Royal Commission. It is 2  years after the events in her life (Series 1) of which she yet struggles. The Commission is established in a West Sydney suburb. There is mystery and thriller, love and violence, a story as big as the country itself. This series tackles a complex cluster of highly controversial & political contemporary issues. Issues seen in countries worldwide. Is it really fiction, or story-lines taken from media headlines? The story is powerful, gripping, and vested with emotion. My wife and I felt Series 1 was good; Series 2 brilliant, even as we had to set aside some of our own political/social biases.

Marta Dusseldorp is a phenomenon; leading in 3 different dramatic series at one time in 2016. Here shes in legal, in another a cop, another a Jewish nurse. All are top shows down-under, or should we say UP-and-OVER when Marta is acting? Always an award-worthy strong female character performance. Add to that, she becomes an associate producer for this 2nd series, WOW.
Martas a Down-Wonder-Woman.
Other primary cast: Owen (Damian Walshe-Howling), Lina (Andrea Demetriades), DPP head Tony (Peter Kowitz), Richard (Hamish Michael), DS Andy (Christopher Morris Crownies) [all also from Series 1], and new is Heather (Leah Purcell), AFP Sgt Bianca (Anita Hegh), and a new (beautiful) face in acting you can expect to see more from Melissa Bonne.

7751334,2,B01FQIUDPW,"Half of S2 is missing. In the first four episodes I've been able to watch, Janet is dealing with personal loss and professional changes that are intertwined with her personal life. The writers allude to connections and Janet being the intended target, but I've lost interest. I just can't get on the PC bandwagon for what's being paraded in front of me. S1 was very decent and even recommended it to my daughter. While I love Marta's other endeavors, this was was just a bit too much. Oh, and the issue with Ash's sister just did nothing but tick me off; Auntie Deb needs to shift her focus and calm duhfuhk down.",1474070400,,613,4.482142857142857

7751336,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Great acting as usual, lots of tension and suspense. I love the complicated relationships and the mystery elements. Janet is a different person in some ways this season because of great tragic loss (trying to avoid spoilers here), which gives the actor real scope for her growth and tension between the 2 parts of her life. Most of the wonderful supporting cast is back as well, so it is nice to catch up with old friends, so to speak.

For those who are giving it 1 star-shame on you. You know it's like regular TV, new episodes each week, so why whine about it? It says so right on the page. Maybe they should offer it in one lump, but it also says SEASON PASS when you buy, that entitles you to every new episode, so there is no scam or rip-off implied. It seems a pretty crap thing to do to give one star to the SERIES rather than to Amazon if you are annoyed with them. Duh, guys. Seriously. Just enjoy the show.

 They have left openings for new characters and have evolved characters from season 1 into full fledged, independent beings. Unlike some people finding the character of Janet sniveling and selfish regarding Ashley's fertilized embryo I thought the portrayal was honest as the symbol of what was left of her partner and a lost future potential.

8761201,5,B01FQIUDPW,"Season 2 of JANET KING (The Invisible Wound) represents a significant advance over Season 1.  The story is tighter and more interesting.  Subsidiary characters are developed to a more satisfying degree; the production values appear to be enhanced; we see more of Sydney than downtown traffic flow/crawl and we have an interesting mystery that is developed, investigated and solved, with just enough twists and turns along the way to create authentic tension.

We are two years past the end of season 1.  Janets partner Ash has been shot to death (in the backwas Janet the intended target?).  The sleazy Attorney General has asked Janet to serve as the head of a special commission to investigate the illegal importation of handguns, one of which, it appears, was used to kill Ash.  The Commissioner role gives Janet both power and exposure.  We wonder (and she wonders) from the get-go whether or not the rather oily AG is setting her up.  The general conclusion is that if she fails her career will be over and if she succeeds the AG will take all of the credit.  Fortunately, she is allowed to bring her whole team along with her, including Owen and Richard, both of whose characters are developed nicely in this season.

There is a running subplot concerning a frozen embryo which Janet believes is her property.  Ashs sister, however, wants the embryo in order to have the child which she has been unable to conceive.  They go to court over this and there is some legal byplay about whether or not the embryo is property or life.  I was ambiguous with regard to this subplot but in the end I believe that it worked.  All in all this was an engaging and satisfying season.  Note that there is one scene involving partial (and ultra-brief) nudity, some crude language and appropriate but realistic violence.
