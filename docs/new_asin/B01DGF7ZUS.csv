There are only 10 episodes, and the humor is rather risque, but if dumb humor and sexual humor are your thing you'll probably enjoy this one.

I hope that in time this series becomes more popular so we can have more options for purchasing. The box set is very... basic.",1491609600,,427,4.3924050632911396
