6479994,1,B00LDCJ19A,"Making a serious horror movie based on a silly creature like a leprechaun was always going to be challenging.  It might have worked with a better script and less annoying filmmaking techniques than we get here.  Leprechaun Origins spends much of its running time concealing the monster, and I got tired of that ""through the leprechaun's eyes"" perspective by the second time it was used.  The editor must have thought it looked cool though, because it kept reappearing throughout the movie.

I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  Don't bother.",1523491200,,545,5.011111111111111

6479997,3,B00LDCJ19A,"This is a fine creature feature in and of itself, they just shouldn't have called it ""Leprechaun.""  Apparently it's by the same people who made the series, so I have no idea why they decided to do things differently.  Warwick Davis wasn't asked to be in this one, and he said he has no idea why not, he would have loved to do it.

6479998,1,B00LDCJ19A,"Really bad. I mean, the acting, writing etc. Its like the first 5 minutes of an episode of Supernatural stretched to an hour and 20 whatever minutes, with no big Sam and Dean pay off. They don't even show you what he looks like till the last 30 minutes. He looks nothing like a leprechaun, more like some cross between pig, dog and human or some mutant from The Hills Have Eyes. His ""gold vision"" is a joke as well. If 0 stars was an option, I would have chosen that. This has to be one of the lamest movies I have ever seen. If I wanted to watch Gollum attack people, I'd watch Lord of the Rings. Leprechaun in Space and both Leprechaun's in the hood were a lot better. Just, don't waste your time.",1522108800,,699,4.147058823529412
6479999,1,B00LDCJ19A,sometimes a bad idea can be great if the execution is excellent so when I popped in despite terrible reviews I was hoping that maybe hardcore fans knock review score and movie was better than user reviews and imdb score stated. cough cough last jedi. Not the case after shaky but promising begining it gets much worse.  More of a monster movie like werewolf in Ireland atmethosphere without the transformation.  The werewolf jut wants to eat them but they never how wearwolf and use stupid infored camera but makes the 1980's movie the predator look hi tech in comparison.  WWF movies are usually mediocre  low brow cheap but entertaining however this is boring and stupid. not laughable bad just bad in I'd rather watch paint dry,1522022400,,730,4.76984126984127

6480001,2,B00LDCJ19A,"This is the 'Halloween 3' of the Leprechaun' series, except I'd much rather watch Halloween 3 than this. This is in no way, shape, or form a true 'Leprechaun' movie. The original 6 with Warwick Davis are cheesy and fun. This Leprechaun is more of a beast creature and you can never really get a good look at him til the very end.

Some college friends are back-packing in Ireland. They meet an old man named Hamish who takes them all out to a cabin. This time, the people in town are in on it and let the Leprechaun attack the group as compensation for taking its gold years ago. This really isn't too memorable. 'Leprechaun: Back 2 Tha' Hood' is even better than this. Please don't watch LEPRECHAUN ORIGINS!!!",1521590400,,710,4.461538461538462
6480002,1,B00LDCJ19A,"it wasn't anything like the first 6 with Warwick Davis who made a great Leprechaun. if this would've been like those then maybe it would be almost good. i didn't buy it. it was on the SYFY channel and i recorded it and watched it thinking it would be like the others, with just a different actor playing the leprechaun, but nooo it has nothing to do with the others so it shouldn't  be called Leprechaun  origins. they even have it in a seven dvd set with the original 6 with Warwick Davis. that's just not right. don't get it. i wouldn't pay a single penny for it. if someone gave it to me then maybe i would take and keep it. other than that no! so if you want to see the original origin of the Leprechaun see the first one with Warwick Davis. it's just like with the Halloween movies. Halloween III has nothing to do with the other Halloween movies. no Michael Myers nothing about him. that's what this movie is like to the other Leprechaun movies before it. nothing to do with the others.",1521331200,,992,4.2712765957446805
6480003,5,B00LDCJ19A,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film.

I'm a fan of the Leprechaun franchise because I love its zanniness mixed with horror. The entire series embraces its camp. Warwick Davis is great even when the films are just plain weird.

This latest installment is a WWE production to push a particular wrestler Dylan ""Hornswoggle"" Postl. I'm not generally a fan of the WWE films, although I've always thought they should be great, action film actor fodder. A few are decent but most are plain lacking. This movie is an odd WWE film, because Hornswoggle is apparently in it but you can't tell. He is layered under creature make up. Plus, the film wisely hides him for most of its run time.

As a fan of the original six movies' camp I was disappointed to hear that this movie was going to try and play it straight: a horror movie about a leprechaun. Oddly, it works. This film sets aside its camp roots and plays it as a survival horror with a creature. It doesn't really work as a prequel per se but it is a fun stand alone film. No shoe shining. No jokes from the villain. It does still manage to throw shade at Lucky Charms but otherwise feels like its own film instead of a part of the series.

Set aside your expectations and give it a try.",1521331200,,1238,4.369565217391305
6480004,1,B00LDCJ19A,"If you are a fan of the original movies starring Warwick Davis as the leprechaun himself prepare to be IMMENSELY disappointed. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the original movies and its supposed to be a prequel. The leprechaun itself, I'm not saying himself cause I'm not sure if its male or female, doesn't act like the one  in the original played by Mr. Davis at all, nor does it look like him. Instead of a wise cracking little man in a suit, we have this ugly little turd that acts more like an animal fueled by instinct. It didn't even spoke one single word, that just pisses me off. I wouldn't be so harsh if this was its own movie, but if its supposed to be a prequel to an already established movie, this is just an insult. WWE should have just left this series alone.",1521158400,,790,4.302013422818792

6480029,3,B00LDCJ19A,"I don't quite understand Leprechaun: Origins.  It's apparently not part of the famous Leprechaun series considering these leprechauns don't have the humor nor do they even speak like from the 80's and 90's films.  This makes the movie confusing to watch because you're sort of expecting humor but it never happens.  No these leprechauns are strictly business!  Strictly about killing that is.  When a group of American students visit an Ireland tavern, they get word from one of the locals (Garry Chalk) about a mysterious place that no history book will mention.  This entices the teens to take a trip to this place to find out more considering they specialize in history.

Turns out Garry and his son (Teach Grant) are actually planning to lock these teens inside a home in the middle of nowhere because they're a bunch of outsiders who apparently deserve to be fed to the leprechauns, even going so far as to place a gold chain on the front porch to attract the little critters.  Well I'll be!  That's a horrible way to treat your guests!  It was never clear why these innocent teens deserved to be killed other than the leprechauns are getting hungry and need fed.  It's obvious that Garry and Teach should have shot the leprechauns a long time ago given how vicious they are, but the story never explains why they wanted to keep them alive.

Of course when everyone arrives to the house, the teens hear mysterious growling sounds in the weeds and question it.  The explanation is that they're wild boars.  I actually thought this was a joke reply, but it turns out wild boar DO live in Ireland.  I never knew!  Anyway once the teens are nice and locked up inside with a leprechaun hiding under a bed, they get the surprise of their lives when they first realize there's a leprechaun creature trying to attack them, but also when they notice they can't leave!  The doors and windows are locked!  Now that's freakin' scary.  This means while escaping through a tunnel they have to actually deal with the creature, and one of the teens gets his leg ripped up pretty bad.  I actually think considering the extent of the injury he should have been limping around more.  It looked really bad!

Anyway eventually the teens find themselves running down dirt roads and coming into contact with Garry and Teach.  Now Teach is a good guy so to speak.  He realizes it's wrong to kill people for no reason, especially innocent outsiders, but Garry will have none of that.  Even the old lady the teens come across... yeah she offers them a ride but it's not where they want to go, so the teens soon end up tied around trees with gold around their necks to try and attract the leprechauns.  Wow Garry really wants these American kids dead!  Come on, at least let them run free!

The problem with this movie besides the fact these leprechauns are humorless and meat-ripping little monsters unlike the classic 80's films, is that none of these teens really stand out in any memorable way.  They're very forgettable.  Two girls and two guys, and none of them were given any personality to work with.  Really a shame.  At least the film eventually gets scarier and bloodier later on with improved suspense, but it still feels weak.  Perhaps the best part is that the attention turns to Garry and Teach pointing guns at each other when Teach finally has enough, and a decent short-lived storyline occurs as a result.  Oh and the suspenseful parts are a victim of constant camera jerking.  This means often you can't even see what's going on.  You can tell the teens are fighting a leprechaun, but things move WAY too camera-jerkingly fast so you barely see it happening.  The one teen having her tongue earring ripped out and eventually her face accidentally smashed in (by her traumatized friends- great moment!) are the only two moments of the movie we can see the suspense happening.

Very bad ending though.  What a horrible way to wrap up what just happened.  So the acting's really good, the picture is believably scary too, but the writing could have been a lot better.  Give the teens and the leprechauns some personality for goodness sake!  Some backstory on the old lady, Garry, Teach and the leprechauns would have been nice too.  Otherwise it's okay.",1472774400,,4247,4.690121786197564

The translation of Tuatha de Danann as Leprechaun is laughably bad, and even a modestly informed person in the area of Celtic mythology would have picked up on that instantly. But, that aside, it also was just not a good horror movie. It had nothing in it that was psychologically scary, it relied on the tired, played out physical horror, and sudden suspense to cause you to jump, which is not in any way scary. I'd say the only thing they actually did right was the fact that for the majority of the movie you couldn't see the monster clearly, which did add something to the ""horror"" if you want to call it that.

6480094,2,B00LDCJ19A,"Let's engage in a thought exercise.  Imagine victims being hunted by velociraptors in a field of tall grass.  Looks pretty cool, doesn't it?  But now, take away all the special effects and great shots.  Not as cool, is it?  This is essentially how this WWE movie beginswith a weak chase scene.  Presumably, this is how the story will end for our protagonists.

Four American 20-somethings backpacking through Ireland stop in a random countryside village pub where they meet a friendly local (Garry Chalk; The Fly II, Freddy vs Jason) who gets them excited to see The Stones of the Gods, ancient stones that have been in place for centuries.  Sophie (Stephanie Bennett; Grave Encounters 2), Ben (Andrew Dunbar; SGU), Jeni (Melissa Roxburgh; Sorority Murder) and David (Brendan Fletcher; The Revenant, Ginger Snaps 2-3, Freddy vs Jason) are excited for adventure and accept an invitation to stay the night in the local's cabin.  Just one problem, this quaint Irish has a secret.

It turns out these tourists were simply lured into serving as an offering to a carnivorous leprechaun.  Evidently, the townspeople once stole the leprechaun's gold and in order to appease this creature of Irish myth, they must periodically offer it human sacrificesbasically like King Kong.  I think the leprechaun likes earthy seasonings, because it loves dragging its victims.  We must see about four completely gratuitous horror drags.

The gore starts out slow, but then builds up a bit in the last 30 minutes.  At first we never see things happen (e.g., lacerations and impalements), instead only seeing the gruesome aftermath.  But later we get to enjoy an axe to the head and a spinal cord rip.  So one can't say this movie didn't make an effort.

Similarly, we never seem to see the monstrous leprechauns until the end.  Before that we only ever see the beast blurred out of focus, which is really frustrating.  Upon finally seeing the leprechaun I wasn't thrilled.  It looks like a demonic chimpanzee burn victim--almost like the miniature demons from The Gate (1987).  Maybe that's why it fears fire and light--a weakness that was entirely under-utilized.  But more importantly, the Irish monster gets plenty of screen time whether you love or hate it's malformed face.  In fact, this monster more closely resembles a chupacabra or one of the albino cave dwellers from The Descent (2005) than a leprechaun.

This may have been intended as a Leprechaun (1993) reboot, but it did no such thing.  If they didn't ""tell you"" this monster was a leprechaun, you'd never know it.  You'd just think it was a naked goblin of sorts.

Despite some aforementioned efforts, this movie was largely disappointing.  Sure, I was entertainedbut I'm not sure my entertainment outweighed how annoying it was at times.  The best part about this movie, other than a hilarious axe-to-the-face scene, is the Irish accents.  I don't recommend thisnot even as a fun B-movie.  There's too much else out there.

I would not compare this one with the others even though it's part of the series. it's a reboot. in the previews they showed the original and I thought to myself people who have not seen the original and saw this one first and then watched the original will end up liking the original better. all in all it was good for what it was. the acting was good and the story was ok. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do.,1452124800,,715,4.114285714285714

Either bring back Warwick Davis (who has said he'd do more Leprechaun movies) or let this be the final shamrock covered nail in the franchise.

However in this one the thing had no personality and  the characters were boring and not even close to likable. Now the reason why I'm not complaining to much about the acting is because wwe films never really have amazing acting anyway.

I knew this wasn't going to be your typical Leprechaun movie when I heard the first menacing snarls and growls from the monster before he was actually shown on screen. The title of this movie is undoubtedly misleading. If you are going to call a movie ""Origins"" then it's kind of a no-brainer that you should depict how something came into existence--the whys and the hows. Upon reading the reviews, I saw that many took issue with the fact that the leprechaun did not in any way resemble the original character. That didn't really bother me, although I kept waiting for the reveal that would explain how this creature evolved into the Leprechaun we know from the other movies. I surmised that maybe the filmmakers just didn't procure the rights to make a Leprechaun movie with the likeness or characteristics of the other little dude, so they went ahead with this reimagined tale. That seems to be the only logical explanation. Another hiccup I noticed is that this story takes place in modern times, and we've seen from the other movies that ol' Lep has been about his evil shenanigans for centuries, so the continuity is definitely off if this is supposedly an origins story.

6480293,1,B00LDCJ19A,"In their attempt to take a more ""grounded"" approach, the filmmakers have stripped the Leprechaun of anything and everything that might make it interesting or fun.  No pot o' gold.  No pipe.  No fancy clogs, waistcoat, or top hat.  No clever quips or riddles (or dialogue at all, for that matter).  No anything that you would normally associate with Leprechauns.  This ""Leprechaun"" is interchangeable with any other bloodthirsty, snarling creature from countless other B-movies.  And it's not even that good of a creature.  It's just a vertically challenged orc with a speech impediment.  Don't watch this movie expecting to see a true Leprechaun and definitely don't stick with it just to see what the ""Leprechaun"" looks like--you'll be let down and disappointed.",1437436800,,763,5.188524590163935

Worse, it's a clich of itself. In this scene it's lightning quick, the next, the guy with a bad leg is outrunning it. This scene it's a terminator, the next it just stops to sniff and poke.  Just... BAD!

Instead of the dark comedy/horror movie the other Leprechaun movies provided, we have something much more generic feeling, with a group of unsympathetic American college kids being lured into a trap by some unsympathetic Irish villagers for some unspecified reason.

Not one of the worst horror films I've ever seen, Leprechaun Origins comes off as incredibly bland and unoriginal. Right away you get the feeling that you've seen this basic premise a million times before: young, attractive (vapid) hitchhikers wander into odd rural community and end up over their heads in whatever strange hoodoo the country folk have going on.
The Leprechaun doesn't even look like a leprechaun. It looks as if Gollum and Nosferatu had a baby. It can't speak and for some reason it has the Predator's thermal vision. I'm not even sure why WWE star Dylan Postl was hired to act in this film. You rarely see the Leprechaun and when you do it appears to be CGI'd into the scenes.
So for a film with characters you don't care about, a monster you rarely see (and when you do see it, its a very underwhelming experience) and a recycled plot I give Leprechaun Origins a single star. Do yourself a favor and buy Leprechaun in Space or Leprechaun: Back 2 tha Hood - at least then you'll get a few belly laughs out of the absurdity on screen.",1426896000,,1167,4.535545023696683

Leprechaun fails everywhere else--which is everywhere it counts, unfortunately.  The writing is terrible.  At one point the ""outsiders"" want to run, then they want to fight, then they want to run, then they fail to attack the ""leprechaun"" when it is vulnerable and run away, then they decide (during running away) that they are going to KILL it.  What . . . the . . . hell is wrong with you people?  Unbelievable.

The ""leprechaun"" itself is one of the worst monsters in cinema history.  SERIOUSLY, those old horror movies from the 70's-80's with bad budgets ALL have better make-up and effects than this modern horror flick.  This leprechaun looks like an albino larva with a head like a potato.  It mewls and growls.  Can't even speak.  Wears no clothes.  Just ridiculous.  There are scarier things creeping around the ghetto.  Plus, you can see the plastic clearly.  Fake, wobbly fingers with no joints.  Fake Halloween mask skin.

BUT . . . fear not, if the sight of this monster bothers you.  Because you will barely EVER see it.  Throughout the ENTIRE movie.

Leprechaun is a terrible horror movie.  If Hornswoggle WAS actually in this, he must have been playing a night stand or a boulder, because he does not act in this film.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS.

Instead, watch the Leprechaun movies that started in the 80's with Warwick Davis.  Yeah, they get corny, but they are a HELL of a lot scarier and more believable.  And someone actually put EFFORT into writing those stories.",1422144000,5,1727,4.688963210702341
6480410,1,B00LDCJ19A,"To be an ""Origin Story"" prequel, it must do 2 things: a) Obviously, tell the 'origin story' of how it all began... and, b) Connect to the 1st/Original ""Leprechaun"" story-line (i.e. it must have continuity of story).
While this film *does* do the 1st, rather haphazardly and without detail... it does *anything but* the latter.

The Leprechaun in this movie is a grotesque, mindless killing-machine... and by mindless, I mean everything that implies, as if it's intelligence is no more advanced than that of an average mammalian predator (such as a wolf, for example), able to stalk and kill it's prey; but not much else.

While this would not be a bad thing if this were a stand-alone film about Leprechauns, it IS a bad thing, when it's supposed to be the 'Leprechaun franchise' Origin-story... as it does not even attempt to explain how this mindless creature is transformed into W.Davis', walking, talking, jesting-prankster Leprechaun we're all familiar with... and thus, it utterly fails to live up to it's own name; and makes no sense & therefore, has no place, in the Leprechaun franchise (of which I'm not a fan; but I did like the original back in the day, so I can only imagine how sore actual fans of the franchise are at this terrible movie).

(Semi Non-Spoiler):
I kept thinking (toward the end), ""Okay, so one of the guys (likely the Irish son) will end up killing it, and in doing so, has to take it's place & become the new Leprechaun, and that's how we get from this mindless, language-less creature, into Warwick Davis' quipping-trickster Leprechaun... LOL, but no... They didn't even have enough foresight or imagination to try and make that work... Though, what do you expect from ""WWE Films""?",1421539200,2,1713,4.819727891156463

6480417,2,B00LDCJ19A,"First-time writer Harris Wilkinsons story kicks off quickly, with a few deaths during the opening sequence to set the tone. We follow the two couples as they innocently enter a small hospitable town that provides them with a cabin for the night  a kind gesture that soon proves to be of ill will. At the 27 minute mark the Leprechaun finally makes contact with our protagonists, causing havoc but not doing too much damageyet. We learn that the town has been plagued by the Leprechaun for ages and they must provide sacrifices for it to feast on or the townsfolk will suffer the same fate. For a film with Origins in the title we really do not learn much about the origin of the Leprechaun, which is one big reason why you should not take this film seriously. At the 54 minute mark the horror picks up again and we finally start to see the good stuff  gore/kills. For the most part the story really does shy away from on-screen kills and it takes over an hour before the first full-frontal slaying takes place. If you are expecting a Leprechaun similar to the one in the Warwick Davis series you are definitely out of luck. This Leprechaun is more of a creature, and it does not speak at all. While the 1993 film is a fun flick this one takes itself seriously despite some very poor writing and direction. I was glad to see live gore during a few of the kills, including a spine-removal scene (ala Predator 2) that made for the best the flick had to offer. Do not be fooled by the films listed runtime. Whatever promotional material you come across will say that this is a 90 minute film, but it includes 12 minutes of end credits, giving you a 78 minute flick where the good stuff doesnt really kick in until the third act, which is almost an hour in.

Director Zach Lipovsky breaks away from his TV-movie background but sadly gives us a film of poor TV-movie quality. I did enjoy his dark and gloomy atmosphere heavy in shadows and low-lighting, but everything else regarding his direction was either mediocre or sub-par. The look of the creature was OK but the execution of the beast was unfortunate. We are witness to POV filming from the creatures point of view, which proves to be a poor decision, and his execution of the horror does not take full advantage of what his antagonist has to offer. I was glad to see live gore during the most important kill of the film, but with some of the other potentially positive ones coming via s***ty CGI it was once again hard for me to take this film seriously.

Overall, Leprechaun: Origins has absolutely nothing to do with the notable series that gave Jennifer Aniston her start and birthed several outlandish sequels, but that is not a problem. The problem is the film is poorly written, executed to mediocrity, and just a waste of time / money.",1419811200,3,2795,4.496062992125984

6480425,4,B00LDCJ19A,"I was kind of surprised at all of the negative reviews for this film when I logged on here, but after reading several, I see where the film and it's audience parted ways. If you are looking for the wise-cracking, limerick spouting villain of the previous films, then you will hate this film. The Leprechaun in this film is more animalistic, and does not speak. ""Leprechaun Origins"" goes for chills instead of giggles.

Two couples are traveling through Ireland and stop at a small isolated village on a day trip. At the local pub they are told of ancient stones located nearby that could trace back to the origins of the Celtic people. It's a long hike and one of the locals tells them that they can stay in a remote cabin for the night before starting out on their hike. The couples agree and soon find themselves bedding down for the night in the rustic cabin. One of the girls hears something in the middle of the night, and when looking out the window she sees something run by. She wakes up her friends and they soon discover that they have been locked in the cabin, and something is inside the cabin with them.

I think this movie works really well as a monster movie, and it would be better if you were to think of this film along the lines of ""Venom"", ""Splinter"" or ""Abominable"" instead of the previous ""Leprechaun"" films. As I stated earlier, this creature doesn't speak, it's a monster, kind of like a giant rat-thing that simply hunts down anyone in it's territory. Gold is still the lure to get the creature motivated, and they give us a backstory as to why this monster is drawn to the precious metal.

The creature itself is pretty creepy looking, and they do a good job of keeping it hidden in the shadows and use camera angles and tricks so that the fright factor isn't ruined by shoddy make-up F/X or full body shots. They sell the idea that this 3-foot monster can be pretty deadly. Overall it's a fun slasher film, but one that doesn't fit with the films that came before it.",1418774400,8,1994,4.442622950819672

Everything I had hoped for with this film seemed at first like it was going to be there only for it to be pulled away from me. Dont get me wrong because I did like this movie, in fact if it wasn't for its connection to the franchise I would have loved it. If I had went in with no expectations and had done some research I would have for sure. But in the end I just ended up liking the movie which is a good thing since it is a good film, especially for horror fans.

Four friends are backpacking through Ireland and come across a statue in the middle of a field. Wanting to learn more they hike to the nearest town and learn about a secret history and take some locals up on an offer to find out more. They take a trip with them to a cabin outside of town with the plan to hike to further into the area the next day. But as the locals leave it seems not all is as it seems and a local legend may be very very true, a legend that is famous worldwide.

Now before I get into what was a letdown I should go into all the good the film has to offer. The film is the seventh in the series but is labeled as a reboot and it is very much that. The film does away with any comedic sides that the previous films had laid out. The film is very much a horror film and is more serious than any previous installment. It does have some tense moments and despite what others may say I actually thought that the Leprechaun looked cool here. Also while watching this it reminded me of another film but I could not think of what it was, still cant.

Now it is also a plus at least for me that this is a WWE movie and that Horswoggle is playing the Lep in this film. Also I did like all of the actors here with everyone doing a really good job. Director Zach Lipovsky and writer Harris Wilkinson keep things moving at a nice pace and they accomplished what they wanted to do in making this a completely different Leprechaun film. Also I like the look of the film and the mythology here is great.

Now with all of that said I was let down by the total departure from the previous films even though this was marketed as not only a reboot but a prequel, see the title Origins. Now my biggest mistake was not researching anything about the film previous to watching it. Once it was announced I decided to wait and not find out anything until I watched it. Now that was my mistake because if I would have I would have gone in with a different mind state. I was convinced that Warwick Davis would at least make a cameo, I was thinking something like Bruce Campbells after the credits in the Evil Dead reboot. Unfortunately that was not the case here, in fact the Leprechaun was way different in this version.

Now before anyone says something like well you shouldnt have expected I have to say that the Origins in the title is an advertisement of a prequel. But it is the cover of the case and poster that makes you think that this is somewhat like/connected to/ or has Warwick in it with that Leprechaun hand. If you have seen this then you very VERY much know how misleading that is, please check that out before you say something. Also in the marketing for this the trailer kept stating a horror icon reborn which is a reference to the other films obviously, Warwicks character.

Still over all and looking back on it I think that this is a fun movie over all. It very much fits into the new style of horror that has been mainstream since the early 2000s. You get some behind the scenes stuff, trailers and such in the special features. I would have loved a commentary of some kind, it may have upd my score. I would say check it out because you may enjoy it especially if you didn't like the previous films.",1415232000,3,3705,4.166201117318436

The only good part of the movie was that it did pay homage to the original movie with the classic line of, ""F*** you lucky charms!"" right before the actress destroyed the leprechaun.

I can even forgive a new take on the monster but it plays just like a bad werewolf movie for what it was worth!

Acting is as expected, it's an attempt at a horror movie so no awards here, but they pass ok for the most part, just the script lets them down big time and did I mention the plot?!

How about we do a real origins film? Start at the actual beginning of the 'curse', instead of just mention it in passing SHOW IT, the film is called ORIGINS!

Sadly the only thing the film shares with the original is its name. There absolutely nothing simular. While the original was funny and cheesy. This film lacks what made the originals fun. The leprechaun itself is another story. It didn't even look like a leprechaun. It was more like a goblin if anything. The only thing that made it so was its lust for gold. Another problem was since the movie mostly took place at night and the attacks were quick. It was hard to see the leprechaun. Wwe could have easily used. Hornswoggle the right way but with how the creature was done. There was no need for an actor.

When its all said and done. Its a typical horror movie. For all its worth. It was an ok as it is. A straight to bluray/dvd release or a TV movie.

Pros:
-ok as what it is.

Cons:
-nothing like the original

6480469,3,B00LDCJ19A,"I have a feeling most fans of the early movies are going to be surprised when they delve into Leprechaun: Origins. Much like the Evil Dead reboot from a few years back, theres nothing to laugh about here. Gone is the dark humor and puns Warwick Davis rained on his victims starting with a young Jennifer Aniston in 1993.

The comparisons to Evil Dead don't stop there. Its evident that writer Harris Wilkinson used the remake of Sam Raimis classic as an example to pattern Leprechaun: Origins after. Much of the movie takes place in a cabin in the woods. Even the camera shots from the Leprechauns perspective mimic that of the demon in the aforementioned movie.

Just to ease everyones fears, this isn't a straight remake of the original Leprechaun. Although it does have certain elements from the first movie like the setting of a secluded cabin or house and a basement where much of the action takes place, its really a completely different animal altogether. Filmmakers did a great job establishing the right mood for the film locations and set designs.

Two young couples backpacking through the Irish countryside make a stop at a secluded pub. While the townsfolk seem warm and welcoming, their politeness has an underlying sinister motive. They owe a Leprechaun sacrificial lambs for stealing his gold. The group of young hikers has unwittingly become his victims.

I was impressed by the direction the script takes for Leprechaun: Origins. Producers and writers easily couldve dumped another entry in the franchise full of comical killings in absurd locations like space or the hood. However, they actually took the time to come up with something sensible and believable, if thats even possible when were talking about little magical imps searching for their stolen gold.

The mythical creature found in Leprechaun: Origins couldn't be more different than the one weve become accustomed to. Gone is the quick-witted and strangely cute little man dressed in a green hat and overalls. Were given a growling Gollum-like beast that resembles a reptile more so than a chubby little dwarf.

Although WWE Superstar Dylan Hornswoggle Postl portrays the title character in Leprechaun: Origins, not much should be made of the casting. Its not like he has any actual speaking parts that would make him recognizable. Hes buried underneath layers of prosthetic makeup. Unlike Warwick Daviss character, he doesnt get a chance to inject any personality into the character. He comes across as a smaller version of the monster in Pumpkinhead.

My only real complaint about Leprechaun: Origins is its cinematography. While I can respect the cameramans attempts at concealing the actual appearance of the creature, there has to be other ways to do so besides shaking the camera and making abrupt cuts from one short scene to the next. It makes you feel like you're having an epileptic seizure. Many of the shooting techniques used in the movie are annoying and come across as juvenile. Some viewers might find it unwatchable at times.

Leprechaun: Origins is rated R for horror violence and language. The gore doesnt quite reach the level of what we see in Evil Dead, but still surpasses that of a PG-13 genre film. There are no scenes of nudity or sex. The extent of adult content are kept to a few scenes of two girls in their underwear and bras while making out with their boyfriends. They all take place at the same time.

The DVD version of Leprechaun: Origins contains some interesting bonus material for fans of the franchise. Two featurettes are included entitled Leprechaun: An Icon Reborn and Leprechaun: Behind the Blood. They delve into the making of the movie and bringing it back to life after 11 years.

Those who have been interested in a serious take on the subject will enjoy Leprechaun: Origins. If you're one of those who adored the humor and slapstick killings of the previous entries in the franchise, this isn't going to fulfill your cravings. There are virtually no comparisons to be made between the original cult classic and this version. If you're a well-rounded horror and gore enthusiast youll find something to enjoy here.",1413417600,,4141,4.953890489913545

But as a ""reboot"" of the Leprechaun series it really doesn't work on any level.  At all.  Now I am well aware of the direction they were attempting to take this-obviously back to horror and away from the camp of the original series.  In doing so however, what they have created is a completely generic monster movie.  There is almost nothing what so ever to make this creature a ""Leprechaun"" other than the fact that he is running around in Ireland and he likes to snatch shiny things.  There's no real sense of the magical or mysterious or Leprechaun legend or anything else making it something unique and interesting.  The creature is as generic a movie monster as I've ever seen and the constant zooming in and out and blurring of the creature gets super annoying super quickly.  I was really looking forward to this film and hoping they would reboot the series in a similar way that ""The Curse of Chucky"" was able to successfully reboot the Child's Play series back to its horror roots.  Sadly it was not to be.  I can't blame the creators for wanting to try something new and reboot the series for modern audiences, but this just really doesn't work as a Leprechaun movie at all. It would have been nice to see something that at least slightly resembled a leprechaun instead of just some generic-looking, completely bland monster.  Luckily I bought the Leprechaun Blu Ray set with all the movies, so I didn't pay full price for this (it was just added value) to what I was already getting.

6480481,4,B00LDCJ19A,"The Warwick Davis Leprechaun franchise is a cult classic series of films that are suspenseful, campy, and fun. Warwick has created a very distinct character out of the Leprechaun the same way Robert Englund has done for Freddy Krueger. However, like Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982), Leprechaun: Origins had no connection to the films that preceded it besides the title. It was an altogether different film with an all new interpretation of a popular convention of ancient Celtic mythology. Despite the title it was never meant to be compared to or thought of as a part of the Warwick films, despite Lion's Gate throwing it in the awesome Blu-ray box set.

As for the film itself, WWE's famous Monday Night Raw star Hornswaggle is completely unrecognizable to the WWE Universe as he is completely covered in prosthetics. The creature design looked a lot like a mini Pumpkinhead, but it was very intimidating. The plot was one that audiences would expect from the horror genre.

6480494,2,B00LDCJ19A,"(May contain spoilers)

In a word:  Generic.

Honestly, they could have replaced the title monster with any wild animal, ""mythical"" creature, even a crashed alien and it wouldn't have been noticed.  It was all grunts, growls, groans, and a poor creature design covered up by shaky camera shots, light tricks, and a particularly annoying ""blurred"" lens effect to reduce details lead to a creature never 100% seen and hard to identify.  I know they did it to hide the poor creature effects because I watched the special features and seen how much of the actor sticks out of the creature parts, hidden by a skin-tight black body suit.  Sub-par and generic at best... SyFy quality at worst.

Background for the creature is barely explained by a handful of short passages from a book and a reference to a ""caved in"" gold mine.  Again, change the picture in the book and you could put anything in the cave and it would have made as much sense.

Characters were 2-dimension with barely enough development to give them reason to be there.  The ""unsure of herself so she puts others first lead"" girl, the cliche self-centered boyfriend, the ""just wants to have fun"" guy and his easy girlfriend.  And then the friendly innkeeper, overly friendly local that leads you to a trap and the younger reluctant villager that doesn't want to kill folks.  You really don't expect much character development in creature flicks, but without anything tangible to grab onto how can you be expected to care if anyone lives?

Kills were as uninspired as the creature.  Some were even poorly executed gags.  In one kill, you can clearly see the prosthetic back piece the creature was attacking, an added layer as clear as football pads or a medical back brace.  (Credit to the effect guy though, the blood was quality material.  Not his fault they didn't use it well.)

I did like the location.  I'm a sucker for small village in the woods settings for such films and this film had some nice shots, though you don't see much during night scenes.

As a film the makers dubbed a ""reboot"" of a cult class franchise, they failed.  While the original Leprechaun films may not be perfect, they are quite memorable.  This film is easily forgotten.

6480501,3,B00LDCJ19A,"""There's a lot of things about our village you don't know about. A lot of things we like to keep private."" Four friends are backpacking through Ireland when they stop in a local town. The people seem friendly and offer to help them in anyway they can. When they are staying at a cabin they begin to notice things that aren't normal. What starts off as a once in a lifetime experience becomes terrifying when they find out the local legend is true. Even though this is a prequel to the original series it's not necessary to see the others first. That said if you have seen the original one this is pretty much a remake of that one. They hold off showing the actual Leprechaun for as long as they can which makes it that much more tense. Much like the Child's Play series the originals started off serious and ended up being comedy and laughable (Leprechaun In Space and In The Hood). I was expecting this to be cheesy but they took this one in a more serious direction. I'm not sure if I am disappointed in that or not. Overall, more of a remake of the original then a prequel.

THE GOOD: This flick had some great ideas, sticking more closely to Celtic lore, and keeping it in the motherland (as opposed to space or ""the hood""). A lot of the scenery, particularly the old Celtic books and the artwork within, was very well made, leading to some nice

This time around, the ""Leprechaun"" was not a witty little man in green, with a penchant for rhymes. Instead, we're given a small, cave-dwelling creature, whom the natives must appease with annual offerings! Okay, there's still potential there.

But instead...

THE BAD: Even with the interesting plot point, darker tone, and the decent looking, more primitive Leprechaun creature, they still managed to screw it up.

The story progresses too slowly, none of the main characters are very likeable -- in fact, quite the opposite -- and the creature has zero personality/substance to make him memorable. It's hard to really understand what motivates him to continue harassing this particular town.

WRAP-UP: I think they could have done so much for with this movie, if they utilized everything at their disposal properly. As a horror fan, I won't say not to see it, but don't expect anything exciting, or fleshed out; also, be ready for bad dialogue, and a sub-par payoff. If I were you, I'd choose ANY of the original films over this one. Warwick Davis is the only Leprechaun for me!",1410912000,4,1547,4.885496183206107

I couldn't see the monster. The plot didn't make sense. Or its not the same as the original 90's
Leprechaun movies that got terrible after the 2nd one. That it didn't fit in with the original screen shows or plots.
Yes they made dumb dissensions, BUT THAT'S HORROR movies for you.

This movie starts with a couple running for their life. Then it opens on two couples traveling the country and I must say this now the couples are most likely from wealthy families their in college and it usually is the only reasons american people that young are in other countries in couples...so I guess that was a good reason to set them their.

Cute little town their in looking at the tourism old man lures them to a cabin to spend the night and go hiking the next day. To see something awesome. (Yes this is where everyone whines that they shouldn't do it it should be more common sense, but theirs not so stop being such children. Think inside your head unless you and all your friends think like me when watching this.)

House in the middle of the woods/field....( I should say this now when I saw the beginning of the movie it made me thing of Jurassic Park the second movie with Jeff Goldblum when they ran into the dungus.)
Its a cute shanty, but the creepy locks make it uneasy.

Once night hits and ladies and gentlemen the couple are making big mistakes in the world of horror movies and that's DRINKING an SEXUAL ACTIVITIES! One of the girls hear a strange noise and you never go check it out we all know that and she sees it outside. All scared! (I actually jumped off the couch I got a good scare there. *I saw it coming and I still jumped*)

They escape the cabin and run for the next house. It seemed to be afraid of the light... well that doesn't seem to make sense if you recall the beginning of the movie when the filler couple were running in the day light, but it seems to be extra bright lights. The creature is extra scared of.

They huddle into the basement and find clothes cell phones misc items and old rusty stuff. And a book explaining what it is and everything else!

Bad guys come back find them try to throw them back to the creature they all run away again.

Picked up for a moment of relief then BAD bad guy in a woman version. Hands them over tries them to a tree and puts gold on them and the creature goes after them tied to them.

They all escape run back to the first cabin agree to try to kill the monster. (Clever idea on how to due it and what the monster did I don't recall ever seeing it anywhere, Very clever director and writer.)

They run back to the safe house with the lights, but don't turn them on. They try to get safely in there, but no use the monster got them and ran upstairs and a heroic battle is shown.

Runs down stairs then bad guy goes down monster eats him. Gets away in their vehicle gets away crashes it.

I won't tell you what happens at the end, but it leaves me lingering for more. OH watch threw the credits.

If your like me and you grew up with the major points for a scary movie and still live by them.
Then this movie covers them all.
1.) Funny guy dies first (Excluding the first two, in movies like this the tone setters don't count when their just running.)
2.) One of the bad guys dies second (this only counts when their is bad guys like this in it.)
3.)Funny guys girlfriend dies third.
4.)Main guy dies fourth in a valiant attempt of saving his girl.
5.)Main villein dies fifth for his crimes.
6.)THEM BIG SHOCKER the monster dies.
7.) The girl gets away.

Honestly the movie was really good in my opinion. I enjoyed not seeing them use mini green guys run around attacking them.
The fact that they only used literally only used 4 main spots in the movie for the creature and the people was pretty good I thought.
I liked the acting it felt real, but the funny guy did to much over acting. I didn't know any of the actors in the movie non that I or my friends could recall, but all in all I loved the angles used I enjoyed the night theme of the movie yes the movie made me want answers to some of the things that happened in the movie, but I would only get answers if I spoke to the director probably.
This movie isn't a wait of money if you rent it and I only paid $6.99 to rent normal. And I watched it at the end of the night so for the people who say ""Oh I lost an hour and a half of my life watching this, then you are just a downer and not appreciating the work that goes into this!",1410307200,,4524,4.161327231121281

Expecting total garbage for the run time of 91 minutes, the hope being me and my friends would be able to riff on it and in turn, make it a fun movie for us to watch, if only criticizing it at every opportunity. There were no laughs to be had. The film didn't achieve any level of identity, or horror, so void of any point, it just made for a depressing experience for me and my friends. That and the run time of ""91"" minutes is actually 78 minutes, that being the final 13 minutes of the film are the slowly moving credits. Not only have I not seen a movie this bad, this soulless, this void of character and inspiration, missing an ironic whimsy found in SyFy orignial programming, but the film also not being a full feature length, all things considered, is probably a blessing in disgues, even if the $7 rental breaks down to the film costing about $1 every 11 minutes to watch. Avoid at all costs. Don't buy, don't rent, don't watch a decade from now when its on a local channel, syndicated and edited, even if you have explosive diarrhea from a slightly too spicy burrito for dinner several hours beforehand. Do your self a favor and find a Fresh Prince of Bel Air or Home Improvement rerun.  Sit with friends and watch that even.

Two American couples on vacation in Ireland visit a remote village that has ancient stones. The locals tell them a story to entice them to stay and become a sacrifice to the leprechaun, a monstrous creature and not the likeable Warwick Davis.

The leprechaun was camera shy. We got to see mostly glimpses. The whole story didn't make sense as to why the villagers simply didn't kill the leprechaun with their superior fire power...or have the government do it. This can also double as a cabin in the woods film. The jerky motion of the camera with people screaming, made the cinematography on the same level as the less desirable hand held shots.

Note the hasp on the cabin door was oriented where one could remove the hasp with a screwdriver from the door frame , clearly a Hollywood hasp. Characters lacked development.

I will say I enjoyed the scenery of this movie. Too bad they didn't use more of it. Most of the movie takes place in the dark. The Lep resembles the creatures from The Descent mixed in with the ape monster from Creepshow. Some have even said he looks more like a midget vampire demon or a goblin. Not really the Lep I was hoping for, but I admit it looked decent I guess. The Leprechaun never laughs or talks though, just growls. In the trailer I heard a laugh near the end. No Leprechaun laughs in this though, very misleading! There were so many missed opportunities in this movie. They could have done so much more with the story line. I wasn't very impressed with the gore either, not really bloody at all. The camera always cut away when the Lep was attacking. The movie is very short too and leaves you wanting more. Most of the action is near the end. It's not as horrible as I thought it would be, but this could have been so much better. This was really a pointless reboot that did nothing to reboot the series. Feels nothing like a Leprechaun movie either, more like a creature feature syfy original. None of the characters are even likable, except maybe the Irish guy. He was probably the best actor in this too. Bring back Warwick and start over again. The fans are not happy WWE! We want Warwick Davis and a Leprechaun that actually has character and origins! This Lep ain't no good in this hood! Even Leprechaun 4 was more fun than this. I think even Leprechaun's Revenge aka Red Clover had more origins. A pretty disappointing reboot on all levels really. Long time Lep fans will be very disappointed. Nothing scary or interesting about this Lep. Just my opinion though, you may enjoy it.

6480564,1,B00LDCJ19A,"First off, lets get the main thing out of the way; If you think this movie has anything to do with the Leprechaun films starring Warwick Davis... think again. I wouldn't even call this a reboot/remake... it is it's own separate entity. Already it has put disappointment into fans of the original films mouths. Sure, the original Leprechaun films where not masterpieces, but no horror franchise really is. It's the character and what it becomes that fans love, and quite frankly, the movie making industries just don't care about fans that made them the money in the first place anymore. First they make Jason Voorhees a running tall guy with trap doors around his land, then Freddy Kruger became a non wise cracking even uglier no fun hack, and now what we came to know as a funny little rhyming leprechaun with a mean streak if you take his gold has been turned on it's head to make him a monster that has been unleashed from a gold mining cave where a small Irish town send tourists to be sacrificed as food for this thing that doesn't seem all that hard to try and kill. Stupid.

If you are a fan of the original series, don't bother with this one, unless you go in knowing already to expect this has nothing to do with the original films and is using those films reputation to promote itself as being something of an original tale to the series. No, it isn't.

6480578,1,B00LDCJ19A,"I honestly don't mind when a formula is used because when it comes down to it, it all depends on the creature or monster, how scary they are. If they are terrorfying, stuff like falling down, the protagonists are or end up in a deserted cabin or something close and even if the town is in on it, it can be good and scary with a good monster & actors. One example of this is ""Animal"", released this year....The actors aren't really even bad in this movie but they kept changing the characters from being a coward to being brave when it wasn't needed & visa versa; like the main girl, she was very selfless and didn't care if she put her life in danger to save a friend at first, when most wouldn't be so brave & that was great and actually a nice change but then in about 2 more similar situations she did nothing. Another character is very selfish, a coward and a jerk basically right from the beginning and then they were brave all of a sudden when it wasn't needed and they ended up putting themselves in harms way for nothing. I know that is done most likely to have the character make up for their jerky ways & to show that they do care but it was done at dumb moments & it wasn't needed. there also major plot holes, characters disappeared and never came back. One character in particular, they had an important build up with and you would bet that they were going to be a hero of some kind, but then they were gone and that little story line just vanished like it never existed. There was no flow or consistency and no rules all of a sudden. They also stuck very close to the order of who were victims,  they stuck so close It actually felt like characters were killed for really stupid reasons just to stick to that order......It was a little suspenseful, the acting wasn't bad and the creature design and fabrication wasn't horrible from the waist up but the design is also was way too similar to other movies.

If you want to watch a generic monster in the woods flick I recommend Animal (2014). What's really a shame here is at times the cinematography is absolutely stunning. But the acting, the directing, the writing, the pointless POV shots are allllll so underwhelming. And quite frankly there's little to no comedy. Little to no gore. ZERO scares.

On one hand, it will make a pretty decent ""Saturday afternoon TBS"" movie, but as for just sitting and watching it on its on,....NO DICE!  The movie (as bad as it was) kept me relatively entertained up until the final 15 minutes or so.  That's when I started to question my life and the choices I've made.  Watching this movie is like eating Taco Bell.  Seems like an ok idea at first, and even halfway through you aren't feeling too bad, but when you're done you're left with a really bad taste in you mouth (and a terrible smell in the bathroom).  Back to the movie.  These kids make the dumbest (and most generic) choices EVER!

*******Spoilers*******

They are in a pub in Ireland and decide to not only go with, but SPEND THE NIGHT with the first old guy that tells them some story about a place the locals have painstakingly kept from the pages of the history books (CLUE #1!!!!).  So they travel with this guy (after being picked up by his weirdo kid) and are taken to their cabin that has no running water, no electricity, and pretty much nothing else.  (CLUE #2!!!!)  Long story short, the little Leprechaun shows up for some gold and starts causing chaos.  Have these locals ever actually thought about just killing this little critter instead of giving up all THEIR gold to make amends from someone else's past mistakes?!  Then after getting away, they get in the car with Grandma, who just happens to be driving by herself at nighttime in the middle of nowhere!  (CLUE #3!!!!)  I'll stop here cause if you want to watch the rest, go for it.

******End Spoilers*******

All in all, the acting wasn't too bad.  The audio and video were good, but the effects and makeup were TERRIBLE!  The Leprechaun had the worst makeup job ever.  I've seen many MANY indie movies with really good effects,...this one was the opposite.

The ONLY reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of the obvious 1 was because up until the final 15 minutes, it wasn't a complete letdown.  Honestly, before then I was intending to give it a 3 star rating.  That fell through REAL quick!

6480584,1,B00LDCJ19A,This movie is bad on so many levels. The Leprechaun doesn't even look like one. You also never here him speak just grunt and snarl.,1409184000,2,131,4.28
6480585,1,B00LDCJ19A,"Okay, the premise could have had potential...a mythical creature is out there, a subset of villains want to sacrifice to it and as such try to trap and then pursue our protagonists in order to sacrifice them.  But no, it fell totally flat.  And now the elephant in the room...the connection to the '90s and early 00s ""Leprechaun.""  To put it bluntly, there is no connection besides calling the titular creature a ""leprechaun"" and talking about it wanting vengeance for losing its pot of gold.  The pale, beastly monster could have been ANYTHING, they just tacked the leprechaun name to it.  Maybe I'm out of line for expecting it to look like an evil Lucky from the cereal box, but it was really that generic.  They could have put the Great Khali in the role instead of Hornswoggle and no one could tell the difference (they don't depict the ""Leprechaun"" as being characteristically small).  There might have been a little change of the villain being better if they let Horny be himself.  That's right, don't expect the campy yet charismatic performance by Warwick Davis in the original movies.  This is a dark, joyless movie, and thus translates into being really boring and well, generic.

6480587,1,B00LDCJ19A,"This was supposedly a reboot of the 1990's horror series that gave Jennifer Aniston an early starring role.  In reality this has nothing to do with the old leprechaun flicks, which wouldn't necessarily be a problem since the original Leprechaun was pretty lousy--an attempt to jump on the joking monster bandwagon popularized by the later Freddy Krueger films and the Chucky movies.  The idea of doing a darker, scarier reboot of Leprechaun is appealing in theory, but Leprechaun: Origins is a movie that can't get anything right.

The opening scene of a young couple being violently pursued by the leprechaun because they have some of his gold in their bag is promising, but it turns out to have nothing to do with the movie--that isn't the reason the leprechaun is killing people in Leprechaun: Origins, at least not directly.

After the opening scene we are introduced to two young American couples vacationing in Ireland.  The movie almost immediately runs into trouble because all four of the young leads are instantly unlikable.  Our brash American heroes venture into a pub in a small village that has a nasty secret.  Not knowing any better, apparently, the characters accept the offer of free lodgings in the middle of nowhere with the intention of taking a seven hour hike the next morning down a nearby trail.  Naturally the friendly Irishman has motives other than hospitality for putting the Americans in that cabin.

The monster in leprechaun is never seen clearly and turns out to be so generic it could easily be one of the mutants from The Hills Have Eyes, a troll, or an alien.  The movie ignores leprechaun mythology so it's just four people trying not to get ripped apart by a monster--the only reason we know it's supposed to be a leprechaun is because if the Irish setting and the title.

Leprechaun: Origins takes the crown from See No Evil as the worst horror movie to date by WWE Studios.

This film employs just about every horror trope and cliche one can imagine. It dispenses with the wisecracking, murderous Leprechaun of the first six films (the whole reason people watch the series!) for a leprecreature lifted right out of the film The Descent (copyright lawyers, take note). It tries to be a more ""serious"" film, positing an origin for the myth of the Leprechaun, but ends up with (yawn) a one-dimensional creature hunting and eating four attractive tourists in Ireland (how original). Dylan Hornswoggle could have sat this film out, as the creature has as much personality as a CGI one would have just as easily. While I actually wrote to Lionsgate back in the day advocating for a 7th Lep film, I now regret that that campaign was successful. The first 6 Lep films are so-bad-they're-good; Lep: Origins is just plain bad. Like the film Troll 2 (which doesn't actually contain any trolls), Lep: Origins lacks a single leprechaun, and doesn't really serve as a ""Leprechaun Zero"" explaining the origin of Warwick Davis' original Leprechaun.
