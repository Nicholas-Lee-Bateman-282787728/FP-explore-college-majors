4854680,5,B005OTGRUY,"I watched this because Netflix recommended it.  THANK YOU, NETFLIX!  I loved every moment.  From the old-school video games sounds in the beginning to the mentions of The Wiz to the dance-off at the end, I was hooked.  If you liked (or loved) Welcome to the Dollhouse and/or Napoleon Dynamite, this movie is for you.

I loved that the characters dressed in late 80s/early 90s garb.  That doesn't mean the film is set in that era; they speak frequently of Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake.

Sure, much of the overall plot is easy to figure out, but the way it is presented is entirely unique.  The fact that Spork is a hermaphrodite is certainly new.  The fact she has a dong isn't, by any means, the focus of the movie.  We all felt as though we were freaks at 14, didn't we?",1342656000,8,779,4.422535211267606
4854681,2,B005OTGRUY,"The girl playing Spork was great, but the other actors, especially the one playing her neighbor, were so annoying and awful that I could not even bring myself to finish watching the film.  And what was with the fake sky over the trailers?  Everything here seemed forced and too clever for its own good.",1338681600,2,302,4.574074074074074
4854682,5,B005OTGRUY,"Wow, oh wow! This is one of the quirkiest movies I have ever seen and right up my alley!

Let it be said this kind of humour isn't for everyone. It's a fine mix of ""is it terrible"", ""is it awesome"", ""so terrible it IS awesome"". Not everyone is willing to sit around to find out. Some people are going to love it, some are gonna hate it, and some will be left going ""What did I just watch?"". Which granted was my reaction at first.
That said, I enjoyed this movie more than I thought I would. From the first moments I braced myself for a theme of trying too hard to be cool and what eerily reminded me of ""Napoleon Dynamite""..

On the surface this movie may seem shallow, taking a cheap shot at trying to be different and over the top. Give it a chance because while it's kind of weird, we're all kind of weird (sometimes). Embrace your closet strangeness and look for the deeper message. A truly clever movie, from the simple silly names (Betsy Byotch), the stereotypical race/gender roles, to how everything means something and works in it's own way.",1331078400,6,1051,4.357142857142857
4854683,5,B005OTGRUY,In-your-face humor combined with great characters make this movie a standout among recently released independent comedies. Some shocking humor lines are meant to be taken lightly and you can tell which parts they are; while it also has emotional undertones that connect with the audience on many different levels; I sure hope they release a Director's Cut so we can see his complete vision. Overall it was an amazing movie and I have a feeling that it isn't the last we've seen from JB Ghuman.,1328486400,5,493,4.811764705882353
4854684,5,B005OTGRUY,"So much fun. Have watched this film over and over and it still makes me laugh. If you want a light hearted frolic through silly moments, memorable quotes and fab dance sequences then look no further. In my humble opinion this film is destined to be a classic for this generation.",1328227200,3,279,4.490196078431373
4854685,4,B005OTGRUY,"Fun film from Tribeca, ""glee""ish. Reminds me of low budg. Nepolian Dynomite. Happy it is finally avaliable on-line. Got it from itunes on apple tv.",1328227200,2,147,4.92

4854687,5,B005OTGRUY,Absolutely hilarious and sometimes grippingly sad in every direction. Some will cry and some will stand up and applaud SPORK. I picked this movie in 2013 as my choice for best picture.  If you have not seen this movie - you must.  You can thank me later for the recommendation.,1406678400,,277,4.52
4854688,5,B005OTGRUY,"love it ! Sooo funny, a lot of racial humor, but still hilarious.  Story friendship when surrounded by idiots, great.",1392508800,,117,4.85
4854689,3,B005OTGRUY,"Spork is a movie that is a lot like my last bowel movement. It's fun at moments, but not so much fun at others.",1389916800,,111,3.6666666666666665
4854690,5,B005OTGRUY,"A hilarious movie with twist and turns all through out. Loved the setting, acting, and dance routines. I showed it to my best friend... she bought a copy and then showed to just about everyone that would watch it... she loved it so much as well!",1359072000,,245,4.3478260869565215
4854691,5,B005OTGRUY,"A lot has already been said about this movie, and I agree with the praise. What I'd like to add is that ""Spork"" is one of those movies with an undefinable, magical quality that leaves you legitimately changed. That's really all I can contribute here. There's something about the presentation (setting, outfits, soundtrack, sound effects, acting) that gives this movie a feel that's truly unique. In a world filled with cookie-cutter books and movies, that should be rewarded. I'm glad this movie was made, and I'm happy to add a 5-star review here in support...",1352678400,,561,4.91578947368421
4854692,5,B005OTGRUY,"Spork was a well written story about teenage friendship. The language was a little raw, but getting past that was simple. Tootsie Roll was my favorite character. She expressed strong friendship with Spork and was sympathetic to her as a friend. Those two girls had a communication with one another that did not exist between Spork and the other girls. The patience  Tootsie Roll displayed for Sporks bumbling dancing revealed how close they were. The winnings she gave to Tootsie Roll showed Sporks compassion for her friend. Spork was no doubt concerned that Tootsie Roll have the money to visit her imprisioned father. How many friends do that for ya'. Tootsie Roll was the kind of friend who did not give up on the issues Spork had.
All in all Spork the movie kept my interest and entertained me with the comedic characters including her strange brother and his host of friends. The young person in the household here enjoyed the movie so much that she dressed up as Tootsie Roll for Halloween. The likeness was done quite well! She has already watched Spork about 5 times. I'm happy I made the purchase and we will continue to enjoy the cast of characters in Spork!!",1352073600,,1170,4.7073170731707314
4854693,5,B005OTGRUY,"Spork is actually American for `dork' and `loser' apparently and not a reference to a handy dinner party eating implement being part spoon and part fork i.e. `the spork' you can get a splade as well, but enough of cutlery. This is about a young girl growing up in middle America with over frizzy hair, no friends, no parents, living in a trailer park that some trash would turn their noses up at, with her red neck brother called `Spit'. As if that wasn't enough she is also a hermaphrodite so is endowed with both male and female bits.

She is relentlessly picked on or ignored in school and has a life that is as tolerable as being forced to watch community cable channel, in Russian. Yes it is that bad, but no she does have a friend in the uber cool and street wise Tootsie Roll (Sydney Park) she and her ho's are into urban street dance and taking on the Britney wannabes that are the nemesis of Sporks life called `the bee atches'.

Then a `Dance Off' is announced and Spork decides that she just has to enter it to prove she isn't a loser and to help Tootsie with the prize money. Problem is she dances as well as my dad at a wedding after 15 pints, and a whisky chaser. So Tootsie and the crew endeavour to help her.

This is really funny it is deliberately potty mouthed the whole time, it throws in loads of themes we even have a boy who's parents are gay men and he is subsequently bullied for that, it really makes life at that school seem one step below catching salmonella on the `things I really ought not to do scale'. There is lots of music not just `street' jungle etc but a fair mixture there is gratuitous choreography, explicit taxidermy and full frontal bad make up shots, oh and a De lorean makes an appearance. I really loved this little movie, it will put a smile on your face and there are some genuinely touching moments. It is not genre defining but it is definitely worth a watch - recommended.",1351641600,,1923,4.321329639889196
4854694,4,B005OTGRUY,"If you like quirky, cute, odd movies about misfits/underdogs, you'll enjoy Spork. It reminds me of two other movies I enjoy, Napoleon Dynamite (the best movie to compare it to) and Welcome to the Dollhouse.

The music is fun (Thing-A-Ling is now my ringtone) and the story is random. I know a lot of people who loved Napoleon Dynamite and I know just as many people who hated it. If you liked Napoleon Dynamite I would suggest giving this movie a chance.

There are a few stereotypes in the movie (the ghetto black neighor who sprays her hair with afro-sheen and has a daddy in jail anyone?) but despite this I don't think the movie intended to be hurtful. Spork's brother is in fact, white trash. I think it's just a movie about being diferent, finding who you are, and learning to love yourself despite what other people think. Spork comes from a broken home, is considered by her classmates as a white trash loser hermaphrodite freak but she makes friends and learns that wishing to be someone else is pointless and dumb. Love yourself.

My favorite part is when Tootsie Roll is talking to Spork after she hurts her leg and is talking about dancing. I tried to look up the quote and couldn't find it, but it's something to the affect of ""When I'm out there, nothing matters. I can be whoever I wanna be, ya know? I'm somewhere far, far away from this shithole.""

It's a fun movie, but you can't help but feel the longing Spork and Tootsie Roll feel to be, well, ""far, far away from this shithole.""",1351296000,,1500,4.483516483516484
4854695,5,B005OTGRUY,"I have read a few reviews that say this movie is not for everyone and i disagree. Everyone can learn something from this movie. Most importantly, hurt no one. Spork is a surprisingly touching and brilliant movie about reminding yourself we are all akward kids inside and shouldnt take life so seriously. The camera work seems home made in the beginning and gently progresses into beautifully shot scenes that never interfere with the story telling. I appreciate that choice in filming because it lent to the emotional development of the story. Though others compared the film to early john waters I feel the director created something completely original  for a digital punk generation complete with 8 bit soundtrack.
It is very rare that a movie sticks with me enough to give it a second thought but the truth is i cared about the characters and that is very important when watching a movie. After its done you are left wondering what becomes of all the characters and then realize they are the people all around you.
People seem so alarmed by the fact that Spork is intersex but she could easily be transgendered, gay, bisexual, teenage pregnancy, handicapped or anything else that society frowns upon. Society, however, in its need to be normal are oblivious to how they themselves are characters, some more freakish than those they condemn. There were scenes that can come across as shocking or bold but is reality really that far from the way depicted? People suffer needlessly. How can anyone dislike this movie?

The moral is there is no wizard.... its a man with a megaphone smoke and lights so don't life too seriously, hurt no one, love and dance. Enjoy the yellow brick road, we are all on it. Neon or golden.",1351036800,,1720,4.768456375838926

8481924,5,B005OTGRUY,"I can't decide what I love more about this movie: that it had child actors who looked like real, non-Hollywood children, or that it had the balls to let them curse and bring up controversial subjects without shame.

If you haven't seen it, I should warn you that it's a weird taste. If you look at it with a critical, ""this is gonna suck"" stance, then you'll probably get what you're expecting. The effects are nothing special and this is undeniably a low-budget movie, but the meaning holds so much deep symbolism that I'm not surprised it didn't come from Disney or any other big company.

I love Disney company -don't get me wrong- but it's been trying for so long to milk its budget from movies about outcasts. And Disney approaches it in such a family-friendly way that the ""outcasts"" are supposed to be identifiable to everybody -which defeats the purpose! Spork, on the other hand, is a white girl with curly brown hair and glasses. She doesn't know what it's like to be different from that, and the movie doesn't try to say ""Oh, if you're black or gay, you can just pretend your situation is like her!"" No, there are black characters, and a boy with two dads, and they're different than her. But they handle their situations differently, which shows that you can't just make one different character and expect everyone to relate. Side note -she's a hermaphrodite, but the movie doesn't try to teach you everything about what that means. Instead, it's just another thing that makes her stand out.

She has to deal with her family issues, making friends, and being herself. The movie doesn't try to make her prettier (cough -Grease- cough), take away her glasses, or make her dress differently. Her hair doesn't become neater, she doesn't become suddenly popular with a million friends. She doesn't even talk differently -you know, more outgoing. The movie itself is mostly down-to-earth with a few pop songs and exaggerated humor to keep the pace moving.

I recommend this movie to adults, teenagers, children who are allowed to hear swear words, and everyone who's ever been bullied in or out of school.

Long live Spork!",1421280000,2,2129,4.7588075880758804
