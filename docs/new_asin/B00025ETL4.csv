8022436,4,B00025ETL4,"Moh Waan Chue Fong, or Magic Kitchen as it's called on English subtitled version DVDs is a Chinese movie (Cantonese spoken) set mostly in Hong Kong but also twice in Tokyo when the characters go over there to support one of them competing in Iron Chef.  For me the main enjoyment was the curse part of the storyline, where her mother when she was a child told Yau (Sammi Cheng) that females of their genetic line were cursed to never find love, but be really good in the kitchen. Not really the type of thing you'd tell a child but that's what I love about foreign films, they're not bothered with trying to be politically correct all the time, they acknowledge that people in real life aren't so let those characters be so as well.  For example Yau as a child always wonders about her father until her mother shows her a picture of him and she tells us ""I can't believe that old guy is my father, I never asked about him again.""  Anyway the daughter grows up with a mother who cooks elaborate meals at home all the time because job opportunities to do so in the kitchen, aren't fair towards Chinese women in those days.  The mother eventually decides to open her own restaurant but dies shortly after, luckily she wrote down all her recipes in a diary and taught her daughter how to cook all of them.  The recipes are so good that the daughter has been invited onto Iron Chef, over in Japan (this is an actual Japanese cooking show).  She takes her assistant with her for the auditions where she hopes to run into her ex fiance, who used to tutor her as a child, technically they never broke up.  While there we learn how the curse has played its hand, every time the two tried to have sex, the building would catch on fire or something like that.  She tries to get her assistant to visit a brothel, but he only came there to be with one woman, her.

That's the second main theme of the movie, him obviously wanting a chance with her while she is trying to get with her ex, or someone like him. The ex ends up turning up in her restaurant back in Hong Kong with her friend May (Maggie Q, an American actress with the rare ability to play different races familiar to those who don't even watch subtitled movies such as Divergent - Tori, Nikita -Nikita, Stalker - Beth Davis to name but a few). The two want her to cater a party they are having. She's a bit oblivious to the fact these so called friends are using her to cook for them most of the time, even when her assistant points it out.

For me I would have liked to have seen more of the movie concentrate on the curse rather than the trying to hook up with the ex or other men while the guy she should be with remains her assistant.",1493683200,,2688,4.263261296660118
8022437,4,B00025ETL4,"Magic Kitchen is a surprisingly sweet and thoughtful examination of the ways people bind themselves to the past...and what they can do to cut themselves loose so they have a future. Sammi Cheng, always an endearing actress, transcends her usual role as a comedienne. This poignant performance is her best yet.

For Set-up, my DVD gave the choice of Mandarin or two different Cantonese dialects for audio. As an American I chose English subtitles, but I really wanted the audio to be the actual actors speaking. I had no way of knowing which dialect choice this would be. This is important information which the DVD should give.",1310688000,,627,4.859813084112149
8022438,3,B00025ETL4,The movie is good with English sub-titles. But it would be nice for the people describing the movies to say which Chinese dialect is spoken.  This is Cantonese dialect and difficult for people that speak the other dialects to understand it.,1300147200,,240,4.853658536585366
8022439,1,B00025ETL4,The only reason I bought this movie because same guy made one of my favored flicks Sleepless town and the result is I wasted 13$. Its done in typical Chinese style  where people don't  have  any  problems  except  how to spend money. geeee--nonsense.,1296086400,,250,4.6976744186046515

8022442,4,B00025ETL4,"This is not due in the States for several months but this movie came in a lot of movies I bought off Ebay. It reminds me of ""Practical Magic,"" ""Simply Irresistible"" and ""Like Water for Chocolate..."" and it is different in its own right. Sammi Cheng plays a unwilling chef who works in a restaurant more reminiscent of a home kitchen than a restaurant. Most of the scenes in the movie she is entertaining her friends more so than clients. Sammi inherits her restaurant when her mother, the previous owner, falls into ill-health and the story takes place 3 years after she has taken over the restaurant. Her assistant, Ho, (played by hunky newcomer Jerry Yan) wants her to participate in this ""Iron Chef""-like (called ""King Chef"") competition in Tokyo but she doesn't feel ready and resists doing the contest. While in Tokyo to visit the set of ""King Chef"" Yau runs into an old boyfriend, Chun, which makes her reevaluate her life and her past relationships. Yau comes to terms with the bad relationship she had with her father growing up, getting over her relationship with Chun (played by Andy Lau), and dealing with her two close female friends who are well-intentioned but self-serving and manipulative. ""Magic Kitchen"" also features Maggie Q as one of Yau's friends and a very funny cameo by Stephen Fung that is one of the best scenes of the movies. Overall this is a very enjoyable film. If you like this you may want to check out Gigi Leung & Takeshi Kaneshiro in ""Turn Left/Turn Right...""",1085356800,15,1495,4.709923664122138
