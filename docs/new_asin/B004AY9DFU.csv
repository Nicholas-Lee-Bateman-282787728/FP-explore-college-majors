4312629,5,B004AY9DFU,"I'm in my second trimester and have been trying out various different workout videos to keep me in shape and this one by far is my favorite. By then end of it my thighs, arms, and butt where screaming. Its very easy if you've never done the Bar method before. And I especially like how she stretches after every round so you don't tighten up. Would definitly reccomend this to all my new momma's. And I plan on buying the rest after the baby is born:)",1333843200,,451,4.255813953488372
4312630,5,B004AY9DFU,"In my first trimester, I felt this DVD was a little easy (but I can see how it will be more challenging as my baby grows), but I felt it the next day in my arms and glutes.  Very simple equipment is needed - bar or chair, light hand weights, pillows, and a strap (for stretching).",1310428800,,280,4.0
4312631,5,B004AY9DFU,"I have been a huge fan of the Bar Method DVDs prior to getting pregnant and when I learned they had just released the Pregnancy Workout while I was about 6 weeks pregnant, I was thrilled.  As with their regular DVD's, this one does not disappoint.  The moves are challenging enough that you know you're getting a workout, and with all Bar method workouts, you follow up each interval with stretching that feels so good. I'm not very sweaty after one of these sessions, but I do feel that special, ""I have just done something wonderful for myself"" relief that only a great workout can bring.  And the next day I can usually feel a bit of muscle soreness, not the bad kind, but the kind I love.  It's motivating to have an instructor who is pregnant with twins in her 3rd trimester, and her sense of humor is great.  The cues are spot-on and I love the set and the music.  Great DVD, highly recommended and I know it will keep me fit, limber, and happy throughout my entire pregnancy.",1299628800,4,982,4.397790055248619
4312632,5,B004AY9DFU,"I am almost at the end of the road of my pregnancy, and have been looking for some good exercise  for that stage. I have tried few prenatal yoga class, and just hated them. They make you feel lie a disabled person, and I never broke even a little a sweat.  So as soon as this DVD came out I knew it'd be worth it (since I've done the regular bar method classes before and loved it).
This is a light enough exercise  to accomodate a big belly, yet it's almost no different then the regular class. I really feel like I'm doing good for my muscles and getting the workout I so desperately need these days. I feel much more energized after every time that I'm doing the DVD.

The only thing I wish this DVD had is more variety on each type of exercise. I'll be doing it quite often, and I feel this may get to monotone after a while doing the same set of exercises . On the other hand it's a problem with any home DVD that you'd get.",1289088000,2,929,4.032608695652174

8421192,4,B004AY9DFU,"I like this low impact work out DVD as part of my prenatal exercise routine. I am in my third trimester with pregnancy number four, and am trying to keep in shape. Between this, Suzanne Bowen's bar amped prenatal workout DVD (has a cardio segment, which I like) and eating right I am managing to stay on track. I feel great and as an added bonus I've noticed my seat has been lifted a couple inches.

I tried other prenatal workout DVD and these, so far,are my favorite. I'd rate these as an intermediate level of difficulty ,which is great,  because I felt the other DVDs I've tried thus far were not challenging enough.

*****this DVD was gifted to me by a friend who had had her baby already so it cost me nothing. If ordering I would order from bar method website as it is only $20 on their website*****",1432166400,,807,4.33112582781457
8421193,5,B004AY9DFU,"This is the perfect pregnancy DVD. I feel like I'm actually getting a burn and making my muscles stronger to prepare for carrying around a baby. I had already done some Bar Method classes before I got this DVD, so I knew what I was getting into, but I think this is good for any level. Definitely recommended!",1428451200,,309,4.344827586206897
8421194,4,B004AY9DFU,Used during my pregnancy and it was good for toning.,1420156800,,52,4.3
8421195,4,B004AY9DFU,"I took classes at my local Bar Method studio for about two years and also have several of the Bar Method DVDs.  Now that I'm pregnant, I decided to give this DVD a try.  I'm in my second trimester (about 4.5 months along) and was concerned that some of the regular exercises may no longer be safe. I enjoy this DVD and do feel it's a great workout for those who are new to the Bar Method.

However, anyone who has taken studio classes or who has done the other DVDs regularly will likely find this to be a lot less challenging than a typical Bar Method workout.  Each set of exercises calls for a lot fewer reps, and as a result, I never really got to the point that I was feeling the burn or ""shaking"" (shaking is a signature element of a Bar Method workout).

Having said that, I understand that we are supposed to be taking it easier during pregnancy and not pushing it too hard, and I do feel that this workout targets every major muscle group (arms, back, legs, glutes, and abs) effectively.  I have a feeling this will be just the right speed for me as I get bigger over the next few months.  Until I get to that point, I am going to try to stick to my regular Bar Method DVDs and my other pregnancy DVDs (Tracy Anderson and Slim and Toned barre workout), as I feel they are more challenging.",1420070400,,1298,4.188755020080321
8421196,4,B004AY9DFU,"I'd been doing Burr Leonad's DVD workout for a while before I got pregnant so this DVD was a natural transition for me. It definitely gave me a good toning workout and I was always sore (in a good way!) the next day. I stopped doing it in month 8 because it got a little old and slightly awkward for me and my bigger belly. But in theory this could carry you through 40 weeks. The instructor is really pleasant to listen to and she does all the movements along with you - at 7 mos pregnant with twins! If you're a fan of the traditional bar method, this is the perfect way to continue your workouts during your pregnancy.",1407456000,,621,4.183333333333334
8421197,3,B004AY9DFU,"I've been doing ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout"" several times a week but wanted to try Bar Method as I got into my third trimester. The studio classes were very challenging but this DVD was not anywhere close to the challenge of the Perfect Pregnancy or the studio classes. It wasn't easy by any stretch but I'd become accustomed to the difficulty of the other options and was looking forward to a real challenge. I didn't find it here.",1388534400,2,436,4.602564102564102
8421198,5,B004AY9DFU,I got this DVD for $20 at Bar Method website and a ballet barre from Cardio Barre for $99+s&h. Great DVD! This is baby no#4 and looking forward to doing this througout my pregnancy.,1361318400,6,181,4.352941176470588
8421199,4,B004AY9DFU,"I was worried at first about how pricey this dvd was, but if you are looking for a workout then it's worth it. If it's not challenging then you are probably doing it wrong. I'm a fitness enthusiast, and found it refreshingly challenging. I had been purchasing prenatal workout dvds left and right since the beginning of my pregnancy, and this is the only one I've come across that feels like a true workout that would even benefit someone who was not expecting. The dvd is short, but good. You do need a bar, or you can use the back of a chair. You also need weights, a strap, and two pillows (firm), and a yoga mat (optional). They also use this little padded mat to stand on for some exercises, but a folded towel works well. I'm well into my second trimester, and wish I would have come across this dvd sooner!",1359590400,9,813,4.3202614379084965
8421200,3,B004AY9DFU,"I am pissed because I spent a lot of money on this workout DVD, but I was hoping it would be worth it.  Unfortunately, the DVD does not play in my DVD player.  It's a Samsung DVD Blu-Ray player bought last November.  It works on my laptop, but I didn't spend $35 (not including shipping) for a workout DVD that only plays on my laptop.  This is just ridiculous.

***UPDATE***

I just tried the workout (while watching it on my laptop) and I added two stars to my review because I really enjoyed the workout.  I just wish I could watch it on my TV and not my laptop.  I found it challenging and it made my muscles burn.  The instructor was also very humorous and motivating.",1344643200,2,673,4.2362204724409445
