8721802,5,B010CG2DI8,"It was quite a treat to see these movies in HD.  (There are two movies in this one.  One is about s serial killer who is more demented than he is depraved, and with much more nudity than one would expect in a movie of this subject matter, and the other one is a hilarious criticism of religion, with opinions always offered during scenes of scantily clad women).  A ton of value for the price.  Not really meant for a group-viewing.",1448064000,3,432,4.296296296296297
8721803,3,B010CG2DI8,"To get the basics out of the way, this is a collection of slight re-cuts of two of Bill Zebub's ""old titles.  ""Crippled for Desire"" was originally ""Loving a Vegetable"".  ""Quantum Leap of Faith"" was originally ""Jesus, the Daughter of God"".  I'd already seen ""Jesus, the Daughter of God"", so that was a disappointment for me with this Blu-Ray disc.

As far as features, this Blu-Ray is pretty solid.  The features are both in HD, and look and sound clear and crisp.  It has both main titles on the same disc (naturally).  There's also a half-hour bloopers reel from ""Crippled for Desire"", trailers for several of Bill Zebub's odd titles with metal soundtracks, and a behind-the-scenes slideshow of actresses in various stages of dishabille with discordant music playing.

The features themselves are a good demonstration of Bill Zebub's flexibility in his films.  Bill Zebub and Scarlett Storm are two commonalities between the two films (as well as Andrea Hall).  But the director's tastes and manner of discussion carry through between the two, as well.  And acres of female nudity to one degree or another.  I enjoy his sense of humor, so I liked these movies, but he definitely isn't for everyone; check out YouTube, and you'll be able to see clips and/or entire movies by the director, and judge for yourself.",1446768000,10,1312,4.886877828054299
