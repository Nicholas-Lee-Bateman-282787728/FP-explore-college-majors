3664622,5,B001KEGRA2,"The funniest woman in comedy, peo-ple!  Also  the voice of lana in Archer.  Funniest show on tv.  She is also beautiful, but you cant say that because it deminshes her talent!",1302825600,,175,4.548387096774194
3664623,4,B001KEGRA2,Aisha is Awesome!! She is a Great comedian! Very versitile and down to earth. Sexy and can make me laugh. What a great combo.,1300665600,,125,4.25
3664624,3,B001KEGRA2,"Aisha Tyler Lit was an adequate choice. It had it's funny moments, but kept an air of ""A Day In The Life of Aisha Tyler"" - not your usual stand-up show. But, all in all it was entertaining.",1296000000,,189,4.0
3664625,1,B001KEGRA2,"I was looking forward to Aisha.  However, I wasn't good and settled on my couch before her music video comes on.  It wasn't funny and it dragged on painfully long...we get it..u have no booty..so what.

Her comedic timing was off.  Her jokes weren't funny.  She needs to learn the art of the pause.  But most importantly, she needs to stop writing her own material.  It was bad.

Unless you already know her work and you are a committed fan I suggest you not buy this. Theres a reason a used copy can be bought for a dollar and some change.",1255737600,,540,4.2772277227722775
3664626,5,B001KEGRA2,Excellent DVD good price and service.  Will shop again and would recommend to all.,1253664000,,82,4.857142857142857
3664627,3,B001KEGRA2,"She is so funny, me and my wife loved this. I don't know whats up with the audio though, poor quality, but worth it to experience her live!",1248566400,,139,4.0
3664628,5,B001KEGRA2,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aisha-Tyler-Is-Lit-Live-at-the-Fillmore/dp/B001KEGRA2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aisha Tyler: Is Lit: Live at the Fillmore</a>

We had no idea that Aisha was a comedian (and a good one)having only seen her in TV appearances. Truely funny. But, Parental guidance suggested.",1239840000,,342,8.5
3664629,1,B001KEGRA2,"Im going to first say that this DVD from the packaging looks very promising but looks can be deceiving. I don't know who from the various magazine comments/quotes written along the DVD example ""THE NEXT QUEEN OF COMEDY"", ""Smart funny and cooler than Samuel L. Jackson"" but they got their heads up where the sun don't shine and when it somes out they need a serious examination. From the beginning with the ""Noassatall"" rap video starting after you press play was the most irritating attempt at a comedy sketch music video I have ever seen before. After that the show doesnt get any better from the corny jokes to the lame delivery and poorly done imitations. I mean certain jokes and comments made me smile but that was it. Bottom line don't waste your money about the only thing Aisha Tyler seems to have going for her is her looks but she really needs to stay out of the stand up comedy scene if thats the best she has to offer. Im curious as to what the owners of the Fillmore was thinking having that show there considering the comedy legends that have graced their stage. Anyways thats my .02",1239753600,,1097,4.49
3664630,1,B001KEGRA2,"With the annoying video in the beginning, this thing was pretty bad. She is nice to look at but that's about it. She is not funny and was actually pretty corny.",1236729600,,160,4.193548387096774
3664631,2,B001KEGRA2,"The ""no a*s at all"" rap at the beginning was about the last time I laughed out loud. But I just didn't dig this stand up. I was expecting real dry, smart sense of humor. But when she was imitating people and groaning and moaning all loud, it wasn't good. Her material and delivery is just not that funny. Even the audience never went hysterical. And you know why? Because she was not that funny. She talked about porn, marriage, being tall, exercise, drinking, masturbating, being (kind of) black, etc. I smiled a few times. Maybe she's just not my sense of humor (I really like Lisa Lampanelli, Louis CK, Kevin Hart, Brian Regan, Dane Cook, Dmitri Martin, Jaime Foxx, Chapelle). So if you kind of like those people, then you might not find this that funny. Aisha Tyler is beautiful but this was a disappointment.

EDIT: Hmmmmm (as of review editing time) $1.50 for this DVD used. People must *really* want to hold onto their copies.",1236470400,,933,4.586826347305389
3664632,5,B001KEGRA2,"I pre-ordered this a few weeks ago and it arrived this past weekend and it's as good as I expected. Like many people,I first watched her on Talk Soup and seeing her here is even better minus the censors and time restrictions. This Beautiful and Smart lady is a joy to watch and you should buy this...
 RIGHT NOW!",1235952000,,312,4.288135593220339
3664633,5,B001KEGRA2,I just saw this show on Comedy Central. I am now a total squeeing fan girl for this woman. I love her sense of humor and delivery. Go Aisha!! I'm looking forward to more of her work.,1235347200,,182,3.945945945945946
3664634,5,B001KEGRA2,"I was lucky enough to see the live taping of this special and it is truly one of a kind. Aisha is so funny and real! People who already know Aisha as a comedian will love this DVD -- it's a double helping of the great humor she doled out on Talk Soup, but uncensored and totally over the top! And if you know her from Friends, CSI, Ghost Whisperer, 24, or movies like Balls of Fury, Death Sentence and Bedtime Stories, you will see a whole other side of Aisha. She is funny, edgy, honest, and crazy -- plus the extras are great, including the hilarious music video! Don't miss this one. It's more than worth the price!",1234051200,,618,4.201680672268908
8314719,5,B001KEGRA2,"If you want to laugh until you are on the floor, cheeks hurt and tears running down your face, buy this!",1486080000,,104,4.0
8314720,5,B001KEGRA2,"Aisha is absolutely hilarious. I have been a fan of her wit and intelligence since I first saw her on Talk Soup, years ago. She is awesome in ""Archer."" It is worth buying this DVD just for her music video, ""No Ass at All"", alone. I highly recommend this.",1458777600,,254,4.204081632653061
8314721,5,B001KEGRA2,"Oh my gosh!  Aisha is truly Lit!  I felt so bad for her, but could not help myself to laugh with her, so honest and brutal!
She is truly a wonderful person to be able to expose such things and express them so openly and share such horrible things to help people maybe laugh and think!  The part with her being a 6 foot tall black girl walking like godzilla on the playground ""arrrrghhh!!!"", ""oh why don't the white girls wan't to play with me mommy?""  I was laughing so hard, I was crying!",1429228800,,489,4.170212765957447
8314722,5,B001KEGRA2,Love me some Aisha.,1418256000,,19,4.0
8314723,5,B001KEGRA2,"I first saw Aisha Tyler on Ghost Whisperer and became an instant fan. At that time, I had no idea she was a stand up comedian. Saw her DVD at the movie store and rented it to check it out. I laughed until I cried! She is one funny lady.",1395360000,,236,3.74
8314724,5,B001KEGRA2,Aisha is great. This was one of the best stand up comedy dvds I own. Loved her video no booty at all,1378944000,,100,3.590909090909091
8314725,5,B001KEGRA2,"No two ways about it- Aisha Tyler is hilarious.  My favorite part is the ""No Ass at All"" video- d/l'ed the song from iTunes soon as I finished the DVD!  The song aside, this is a GREAT standup special.  Aisha Tyler is Absolutely every bit as funny as Kevin Hart.  I also like that her humor is not mean-spirited or insulting- don't get me wrong, she isn't up there workin' a wimple or anything, but she demonstarates you don't have to be an ass to be funny.  Highly recommend both the DVD and getting yourself an .mp3 of ""NoAssAtAll"" for when u need a good laugh!",1375747200,,563,4.273584905660377
8314726,4,B001KEGRA2,"If you like Aisha Tyler, then you need this in your collection!  She is very funny and insightful and one of my favorite comedians.  Grab her new book too and go see her live!!",1374710400,,176,4.147058823529412
8314727,4,B001KEGRA2,one of the best like it very much .  good price got it fast . my order more things from you,1358121600,,91,3.3333333333333335
8314728,5,B001KEGRA2,"I know comedy is subjective, but the 1 and 2-star reviews on here seem out of whack.  I can only assume the people who didn't like it were expecting something more PG and were put off by the very mature subject matter.  I thought the show was mostly genius (the clip on here really doesn't do it justice).  I liked it so much, in fact, that, having watched it first on Netflix, I just ordered the DVD from Amazon.",1316304000,,413,4.2025316455696204
