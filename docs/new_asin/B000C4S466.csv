8095674,5,B000C4S466,"When a wealthy couple are murdered their daughter, Finn, is spared but severely traumatized.

Finn's GP, Dr Adam Daley, arranges for her to stay with trauma psychologist Dr Sam Graham and her daughter in their remote home in the Essex marshes. Dr Graham is unaware that she is being drawn into a twisted mind game.

This brilliantly plotted edge-of-seat psychological thriller based on the best seller by Nicci French has more twists and turns than a corkscrew. Geraldine Sommerville (Cracker) gives a compellingly flawless performance as Dr James who finds herself fighting not only for her own and her daughter's safety but also for the restoration of her own reason and professional credibility. She is supported by an equally strong cast including the extremely delectable and talented Robert Bathurst as Dr Adam Daley who is not all he seems to be.

Be warned; This is a drama that will stay with you and get right inside your head.",1360108800,,937,4.917721518987341
