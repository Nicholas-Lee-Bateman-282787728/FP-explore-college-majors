2434593,2,B000BP86Y6,"After eagerly awaiting the return of MI-5, I was so disappointed to see the 'recycling' of three members of this amazing cast. The replacement husband/wife duo quite frankly annoyed me. The husband was super-human and the wife irritating and over-confidant. I had to fast forward most of the hostage episode and episode with the wife snorting coke for the scenes with my favorite characters. This season quite frankly blew. I probably won't be buying season 4, I HATE the new characters. Disappointing on all levels.

2 stars.",1141516800,16,526,5.045977011494253
2434594,3,B000BP86Y6,"Producers and writers are always needing to examine their programs with the intention of keeping them fresh. They sometimes take drastic measures, but it is usually a mistake to replace popular and competent leading men and ladies, because as most of us know, the characters (and the actors who portray them) are who viewers come to care about, not the series itself.

So MI-5 has strolled off the end of the pier: in one season we have lost Tom, Zoe, and Danny, and their replacements, though possibly competent, are definitely NOT Tom, Zoe, or Danny.  I may not return either.",1141430400,26,578,4.77
2434595,5,B000BP86Y6,Although partially fictional. It's the best spy show on TV since the Sandbaggers (1978 to 1980). This season is as good as the other two. Worth the money.,1141344000,3,154,4.535714285714286
2434596,5,B000BP86Y6,"I can't believe it!! I'm about 2/3 through watching Series 3 on DVD. I never thought anything could top Series 2, with the Tom story arc, but this series is amazing! The characters are put through so much growth, both emotionally and physically. From the high-paced first episode that introduces Adam Carter and allows for Tom's story to be tied up, to the departure of yet another main character in Episode 6, this Series will draw you in and make you wish for MORE MORE MORE! If you like great drama that follows realistic and relevant storylines, fantastic character development, and heart-stopping action, this Series will grab you within the first few moments. All 3 Series are must-haves to buy, not just rent, because you will want to watch them over and over again. I just wish we didn't have to wait so long for them to come out on DVD! BBC and A&E - your fans want more! Release the DVD versions simultaneously in the UK and the US PLEASE!!!",1138838400,5,951,4.567251461988304
2434597,5,B000BP86Y6,"This is the first time I've written on this site. Question...(see review several below, Albert Bodden), why would anyone say they hate spoilers, and then reveal a major spoiler? Thanks a lot. If ignorance is bliss, you must be the world's happiest person.",1137801600,6,255,4.953488372093023
2434598,5,B000BP86Y6,"They've done it again.  Three seasons, three home runs.  I'm addicted.  I've seen all three seasons, now I have my wife addicted.  I cannot believe people die, ""dissapear"", lose their jobs...and these are all main actors.  This show stares cutting edge action in the face...and spits on it.  Technically this falls more under the guise of thriller, the same way Spy Game did, but Tom Clancy could not have written anything better.  If you can watch this show and NOT become attached, you're a better person than I.  After watching this show, 24 seems like a cheap knockoff.  Drama, action, nail-biting suspense...this show has all of this in ways that keep you coming back for more, and keep you on the edge of your seat after each and every episode.  I hate spoilers, but I will ask only this one question:  Why did you leave us Matthew MacFadyen, why?!",1135641600,10,854,4.6644295302013425
2434599,5,B000BP86Y6,"Yes, MI-5 (SPOOKS) is probably the best yet. As exciting as the best of 24 (but more believable), as well acted as THE SHIELD and as well written as THE WIRE. All of them are excellent shows, and MI-5 tops off with an outstanding soundtrack.",1134518400,7,241,4.377777777777778
2434600,5,B000BP86Y6,"I had known about MI-5 for almost a year before I decided to fork over the $39.95 or whatever it was for the first season (or as the British say, first ""series"") box set. Honestly not knowing what to expect, I put on the first episode...and was immediately hooked.  If you like your drama complex, with complicated, all-so-human characters (i.e. fallible)who confront conflicts that are never black-and-white but always gray, where the ""good guys"" are as prone to ethical and moral compromises as great as the ""bad guys"", then this is the show for you.  This is indeed akin to 24 and Alias, genre-wise, but it really bears a greater resemblance to the best shows on HBO like The Sopranos and The Wire, as well as those edgy FX dramas like Rescue Me and The Shield.  The series is broadcast on A&E but edited for length, language, and violence. The best way to watch this is on DVD.  I bought the season one box set as Christmas presents for two great friends and it took them all of one episode to be as devoted to it as I am.  So buy or rent the first two seasons, watch it as quickly as you can (and you will watch it quickly because you'll want to know what happens next to Tom and Zoe and Danny), get this third season, and devote an hour every night until you finish it.  Your only regret will be you have to wait for season 4 whenever A&E broadcasts it. It's one of the best shows on television.",1130889600,52,1401,4.32824427480916
2434601,5,B000BP86Y6,"The only thing that I hate about MI: 5 (or ""Spooks"" as it's called in the UK) is that they don't film enough episodes per season.  Seriously, it gets you hooked!

I'm an avid 24 and Alias fan because of the high intensity and drama.  When I first heard about MI: 5 I was skeptical of getting it because I didn't think I would like it.  I tried it out and before the second episode was over with (of the first season) I was ordering the second season.

Great cast and believable story lines.  It appears that the budget for MI: 5 isn't as high as some of our American TV shows, but that doesn't mean that it's not good.  The sets are well made, everything is well lit for filming, even the special effects are great.  For a comparable budget in America the special effects would look horrible.

It's obvious to see that the people that produce MI: 5 are the best in the business.  I just wish it didn't take so long for seasons to get released in America.  To the people that make MI: 5:  you've seriously made me consider buying a DVD player that's region-free, buying the ""Spooks"" version on Amazon.co.uk and having them shipped to me.

BOTTOM LINE:  If you like Alias, 24 (Kiefer Sutherland), and government/spy type of story lines, then you'll love MI: 5....every season!  The cast is superb and the story lines follow a post-911 world.  Very realistic and very addictive!",1130025600,27,1375,4.461847389558233
2434602,5,B000BP86Y6,"The best show of it's type, without equal. Check it out on the telly if you can, otherwise it's worth every penny to a videophile.

While Alias is concentrating on interpersonal family disfunction amidst a totally unrealistic spy Drama (Drama-Nauseam), MI5 was trying to portray the real deal; being ruthless, taking advantage of bad situations, smuggling drugs and granting a pass to anyone with political connection.

2434641,5,B000BP86Y6,"One of the very best TV series I have ever seen, bar none. But not for the faint of heart. This season was the most difficult to watch so far, due to the scale of loss to the team over the course of the season. This series should serve as a lesson to U.S. networks and producers on how to do a TV drama. Great production values and fantastic writing and acting by all involved. I won't say any more so as not to spoil things for those who may have recently discovered this show.
Note to BBC America:  You should be putting this show in schedule more often; and at a reasonable time of day on a predictable basis, instead of just tossing in an episode here or there in the middle of the night.",1371859200,,692,4.088235294117647

2434660,5,B000BP86Y6,"Moving into its Third Season MI-5 is still simply one of the smartest, most intelligent, and most dramatic shows you'll ever see. The show centers around a group of citizen individuals who join ""5"" to help ""defend the British realm."" MI-5 is that branch of the British secret service that is focused on domestic threats, be they economic, terrorist, civil uprisings, or any externally originating threat that has found its way back to the UK; a sister branch, MI-6, not a part of this show, deals more exclusively with external threats to the country. The series introduces us to all kinds of real-world threats--both potential and operationally real--and shows how the members of 5 must react in order to counter and/or eliminate these threats. The series is so well written, produced, directed, filmed, and acted that each episode is more of a 60-minute movie than a television episode. The drama, intrigue, intelligent stories, and, yes, action, establish the series as a standout among even the often high-achieving BBC (already the producer of many world-class shows), making it with little doubt one of the best shows of this nature ever made.

Because of the complexity and the intellectual development of characters (as well as the plots themselves), it is best to watch MI-5 in order by episode, with no skipping of episodes, and this makes the DVD release of the show perhaps the very best manner in which to view the production. The DVDs allow you to step your way through each season, episode by episode, thereby viewing the show in the manner in which it was intended to be viewed. This gives you the ability to watch how characters are developed, and to better gain an understanding of how the MI-5 Section D group works. With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.

Season Three has some significant changes in how 5 and the story lines surrounding it is constructed, and since I never want to give out plot spoilers, I will not say anything more than that. As we move into the Season Three and Four episodes, we see with ever more intensity how the members of 5 are asked to sacrifice in all kinds of ways, and we also see the toll that their service takes on them as they do so. The earlier Season Two brought the level of drama and emotional intrigue so high as to make it seem unsustainable: yet, Season Three, and then Season Four, moves the bar even higher. Its one of the rarest of shows that keeps building on its success, stays more than fresh, and meets the challenge of surpassing previous seasons. I liken it to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. That's what MI-5 is like as you enter the third season.

This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these IN ORDER. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of Season One.",1325635200,5,4297,4.64388961892247

With the exception of the very first episode of Season One (the first episode is really not up to the standards of all the remaining ones, an issue attributable to the difficulties inherent in plot development) the shows are incredibly exciting, but also intelligently written in a way that will make you re-think the issues surrounding the role of the security forces in countries, what actions should and should not be allowed, the best way to address classes of threats, the implications for a free society when eliminating threats, the intersection of political and security concerns, and much more. You might at first glace think that MI-5, as an entertainment production, would be no more than that; but MI-5 is certainly more than a simple entertainment show. Be prepared to be entertained, but also mentally stimulated.

Season Three has some significant changes in how 5 and the story lines surrounding it is constructed, and since I never want to give out plot spoilers, I will not say anything more than that. As we move into the Season Three and Four episodes, we see with ever more intensity how the members of 5 are asked to sacrifice in all kinds of ways, and we also see the toll that their service takes on them as they do so. The earlier Season Two brought the level of drama and emotional intrigue so high as to make it seem unsustainable: yet, Season Three, and then Season Four, moves the bar even higher. Its one of the rarest of shows that keeps building on its success, stays more than fresh, and meets the challenge of surpassing previous seasons. I liken it to one of those plate twirlers who gets a plate spinning up in the air at the top of one of those skinny sticks, and while you are trying to understand how he is doing it, starts another plate stirring on a second stick while keeping the first going. And then, to your incredulity, he adds yet a third plate on a third stick, and now maintains all three plates. You scratch your head with amazement even as you watch him keep all three plates twirling on those sticks, and yet he does it right in front of you. That's what MI-5 is like as you enter the third season.

This is a truly amazing show. It's easily seven stars out of five. And the prices of the discs have come down dramatically from earlier years. But don't forget: you need to watch these IN ORDER. If you haven't seen it yet, start with Season One, work your way through that first not-so-good episode, and then watch the thing take of a like a jet. You'll be hooked by the time you get to the end of Season One.

2434662,5,B000BP86Y6,"The ten (10) superb  episodes in season three (3) are really so very good being some very well written, directed and acted British  spy/mystery/thrillers.  I was highly entertained by all of the episodes in Season three (3).  I remained ""on the edge of my seat"" enjoying all of the ""twists and turns"" of this superb espionage series.  This season, to me, shows that while our ""spy heroes""  are busy saving the world from some horrible events perpetrated by some very nasty individuals, the spies doing the saving are human too experiencing some very human feelings such as:  love problems, the desire to be loved, family emotions,. sexual desires, jealousies  etc.

As I said before, this season is so very good with beloved characters leaving and/or sadly meeting their demise being replaced by some very intriguing folk.  The acting is really great.

If you, like me, love ""high tech"" nail biting spy thrillers, you really cannot get any better than Season three (3) of MI-5.",1322265600,3,977,4.896341463414634
2434663,5,B000BP86Y6,"MI:5 gets better every season. The writers seem to have worked out the kinks from the first two series and have made MI:5 an incredible journey into the good and bad sides of humanity. Series 2 (as the Brits call Season 2) ended with a daring cliff hanger. Has agent Tom Quinn turned into a rogue spy? The evidence is against him especially after he seriously and intentionally wounded his superior. I couldn't wait to see how this all turned out. MI:5 didn't disappoint on any level. In series 3, we see dramatic changes in the cast of the show. Several major players leave and new ones are introduced. The characters are fleshed out to a greater degree and in series 3, we see it become more of a psychological thriller as the spies question their jobs and their lives.
How does a spy have a personal life? What do you tell a potential love interest once they have been ""vetted"" and cleared?

Series 3 takes us on a fascinating journey into the minds of the agents. Nothing or no one is ever as they seem. Adam Carter enters as a new top spy ""borrowed"" from sister spy agency MI:6. Soon his exotic and daring spy wife also joins the team. There's no chance of not taking their work home between these two.

The final 2 episodes of series 3 take a deep look into the psyche and morality of the ""good guy"" spies. How far would they go to save the nation from a terrorist attack? Is torture ever justified if innocent lives are at stake? Is it just ""collateral damage"" to destroy an innocent life or two to save hundreds or thousands? These issues ring true today in a world that has changed in the last few years.

The series does not end with a cliffhanger but there is a shocking and surprise ending that will leave fans stunned. Yet the ending fits the show and makes it all the more interesting.",1315872000,3,1799,4.380239520958084
2434664,5,B000BP86Y6,"This episode was very suspenseful and also unnerving.  It shows how one person with one laptop and the right code could take down all the banks, street lights, and basically control an entire country. Let's hope this never happens.",1313107200,2,231,4.923076923076923

2434667,2,B000BP86Y6,"This series in my opinion does not measure up to some of the others. A lot of silly, superficial melodrama took up most of the episodes, especially with Zoe's character, and often the personalities of the characters contradict one episode to the next. As if different writers wrote the stories (which is the case) and could not agree on a cohesive picture for each character. More soap opera than thriller. Too bad.",1303776000,,415,4.777777777777778

2434671,5,B000BP86Y6,"I have seen all of Spooks. And I don't think that Tom & Co leaving the show (and really if you're that upset over Matthew, Keeley, and David leaving, then you should check out some of their other stuff because they've gone on to do some pretty amazing and awesome things) was what brought it down.

I think it was its own popularity. I think it was the BBC and the writers of the show trying to turn it into more of the UK version of 24 instead of letting it be the amazing show it was in its own right. By the time you get to Season 4, the characters become far less likable and while the high octane adrenaline rush remains the same, you generally don't have the character attachments (though there are, naturally, fierce fans of the teams that follow the original trio) you did in series 1 through 3. The show caves to the pressure of having to have a ""crazy Spooks like twist"" at various points in the series.

Yes, no one on the Grid is safe. We learned that really quickly in season 1, but the rest of the series, in particular the current one (series 9 at the time of typing this) seems to come out with things straight from left field that don't seem to be true to the characters they've been attempting to ""develop.""

So my advice to new views of the show? Stop with this series. Please. Please. Don't go on from here. It doesn't get bad, but the following ones just aren't as good and unless you find yourself getting invested in new characters somehow, it's not really worth your time.

Also, for some reason when I purchased these DVDs, I have two fifth discs, so if someone buys it from here and is missing disc five, do please let me know because I have an extra and no real idea what to do with it.",1289088000,2,1713,4.229357798165138
2434672,5,B000BP86Y6,"Having watched and purchased all the seasons of MI 5 I have to say as an actor myself (Seinfeld, Home Improvement), this is as good as it gets and consistently year to year.  My fantasy is that I will get an R2 DVD player and then buy this show in its BBC version as Spooks and watch it all over again.  For sheer thrills and great relationships there is really nothing on TV to match this series.  Start at season I and get yourself addicted.  You'll thank me",1281398400,,460,4.193181818181818

Tom, Zoe and Danny are a one of a kind team. I will definitely skip seasons 4-6 as it obviously looks very annoying. I'll be back with seasons 7 and 8 with Richard Armitage.

2434675,5,B000BP86Y6,"I have now been through all 7 seasons of MI-5(Spooks) that are available in the US. I think it's the best spy-action-suspense series of all time. Unlike 24, it is consistently plausible. I say to
myself after every episode, ""yes, this could happen."" There are always surprises and they rarely stretch credulity. And the casting, with all the changes, is remarkable. It seems that what start
out as replacements always take you in quickly. The best of the best is Season 7 Episode 7. It rises to the highest level of John LeCarre. Don't miss it! I will, however, always miss Rupert Penry-Jones, who blows up at the beginning f Season 7. He was the most debonair of all the characters. I'm sure he'll go on to leading man fame in the movies.",1267660800,2,739,4.56390977443609

2434677,5,B000BP86Y6,"MI-5 follows a small team of intelligence career officers in Britain who must leave their personal lives at home to protect Queen and country. This is a taut, superior drama series which makes cop dramas from America seem flabby. Intelligently written and clearly designed to be addictive for those who like their tv uncensored and adult, the stories of MI-5 reflect today's current political dilemmas, terrorism, economic turmoil, and inter-agency competition. The ""spooks"" (the series original title in Britain) are human, lonely, and driven to try and have a life in spite of jobs that make it impossible. Each actor give strong performances that are serious ensemble cast award-worthy. Gritty stories, nerve racking deadlines, and villians who are truly nasty make MI-5 the best series not produced by HBO.

I have bought all British dvd sets of the Spooks series which have been screened on  tv but edited for the US sensitivities on A&E.  However, the adult subjects and gritty realism of the storylines means that these are far from family GP viewing.  With Mathew MacFayden (Pride and Prejudice), Rupert Penry-Jones (Cambridge Spies), Peter Firth (Clarissa), and various guest actors from the pantheon of the British acting schools, this series does improve with every viewing as more and more details become obvious.  Sometimes alittle too gadget oriented with the extras on the dvd set, the production values are high and there is nothing to really detract or critique.  This is simply one of the most addictive series ever.",1199577600,2,1534,5.165322580645161

I've enjoyed 24 and Sleeper Cell but have found that MI5, with the British accents and intelligent scripts, is even more engaging.  Current events and issues are addressed and the writers are not at all afraid to portray things is a very, very realistic manner.  MI5 is a more thoughtful, realistic and gritty account of what intelligence officers apparently have to deal with on a daily basis.

Still, I am glad I bought it, because the third season didn't disappoint me: the 'downfall' of some of the spooks provides great material for dramatic and intense episodes, and the creators have managed to replace the old crew with worthy newcomers! Even more than in season 1 and 2, season 3 shows how nothing is ever simply black-and-white and each spook struggles with the many shades of grey in his or her work and the tense politics within and between government agencies.

Yes both shows focus on terrorism, but I believe that's where the similarities end. 24 is a fantastic show full of action and suspense, but Spooks is far more cerebral and focuses more on character and plot development. In contrast to those who complained that series three wasn't as good as the previous two, I believe that the producers continued (and in fact quite well developed on) the strength of what makes this show so great: likable characters, and strong writing. Series three also had some fantastic shockers that handled very well the shuffling of cast members. Those that have gone will be missed, but have been replaced with characters that will make their departure more palatable. Kudos (no pun intended) to BBC for giving us yet another great show!

One of the things I liked about the prior seasons is that while the show plumbs the dark side of espionage it was tempered by the close-knit, intense camaradarie of the MI-5 team.  This was, unfortunately, lost in this season, making the exploration of even  darker psycho/political themes hard to endure.  I need to care about the characters when I go into the abyss with them. The writer of the show is making a statement with the introduction of colder less passionate characters--post 911 espionage is playing in a harsher realm. But I miss the passion and vulnerability of the characters in former seasons and find myself not really liking the new characters.

Several of the episodes this season were filled with violence and torture that made it difficult to watch--prior seasons had more implied rather than explict violence.

Still worth watching but needs more human interest to keep me going through another season.",1142380800,36,1086,5.096045197740113

2434692,5,B000BP86Y6,"OK, Is MI-5 as good as Alias and 24 hours?  Yes, it is on par with these programs but has a different slant that will make a nice balance to your library. While Alias has Jennifer in different costumes and an implausible plot and love line, MI-5 seems real in this area. A bunch of agents trying their best but still having to worry if they can meet someone for romance. While 24 hours has more action and intensity, MI-5 has all that, but it is a side show to the real feelings of its agents. Imagine the female agent, looking for love, and having a hotel quickie only to find out later that it is being taped by MI-5 for national defense objectives. Alias and 24 hours don't have to worry about that of course. Jennifer is at times vulnerable in love and this is the best feature in Alias. MI-5 carries this to better level. 24 hours has gadgets (seems hidden cameras are everywhere) and curve balls, so does MI-5. Imagine the lead agent being stalked by his girfriend...enough said.

 MI-5 likes to shuffle the deck as agents are written off, and this makes plot guessing more difficult and thus enjoyable.

MI-5 seems more real rather an over the top melodrama and thus it is easier to indentify with the chartacters. The villians are not all Middle East, as one enjoys the dirty villians in the serive of the British government. My only gripe is the price. 600 minutes at a list price of $70 for season 3  and also season 2 seems steep. Still, I can't get enough of this series.",1141603200,6,1483,4.397810218978102
