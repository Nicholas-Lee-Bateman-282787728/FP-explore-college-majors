I recently found it again and wanted to watch it, but without a VCR I went hunting for this flick on DVD or streaming... No such luck. Amazon was the only place I found this and I just had to leave a review. So happy to see that I'm not the only one out there with feelings for this film.  :-)",1425340800,,412,3.735632183908046

7891323,5,630553795X,Love this old video is great.  The basics never change.  I miss the humor of people like Warren Miller.  We miss you warren.,1397001600,,124,4.304347826086956

7891325,4,630553795X,"My wife and I are advanced/expert skiers and found this video to be really good.  You have to be a very good skier though to understand the information being presented in this video.  Even the most basic skiing  technique ""carving"" presented in this video would be impossible  for a skier who could not balance effectively on one ski and had not  learned to engage and release edges. If don't understand the concept of  weight shifting and can't make parallel turns with all your weight on the  stance ski one of Lito Tejada-Flores's videos would be a much better  choice.
The sections on  powder and bump skiing in the Learn to Ski2 are  terrific and if you know what to look for you can get a lot out of the  shots of expert skiers used to illustrate key points and concepts.  You  probably won't find us spending much time in the terrain park or half-pipe  but even the information given there is useful to a expert skiers.
If  you live in the Northeast and don't get powder I can understand how that  section might not appeal to you.  However, to Montana skiers like us this  is what it's all about.  This video should inspire those of you who don't  get powder during the ski season to travel to a destination where you can  ski powder.  Until you have, you haven't really skied and this video gives  you a hint of what it's all about.",957398400,26,1340,4.423868312757202
7891326,3,630553795X,"I just purchased this video for my nephew who is very atheletic.  I found it to be very advanced. For instance, in the first few minutes, the  instructor speaks of rolling your skis and using your poles in your turns.  He does not mention how to ""roll"" your skis.  He might say if you  apply your weight ankle to ankle, you would get this effect.  Does not  point out where to poll.  I have Warren Miller's learn to ski which I  purchased many years ago.  It has been a great tool for my older niece and  nephew; they loved it and referred to it many many times. I doubt they will  refer to this tape as a reenforcement.  This tape also emphasizes skiing in  powder too much - we are not use to such great conditions in the northeast.",940896000,24,734,4.18705035971223
