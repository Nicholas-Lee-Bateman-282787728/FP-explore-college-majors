5773512,4,B00D45PSIC,It was my mistake.  I thought I was getting 4 dvds . there is actually only one dvd and 3 cds.,1397865600,5,94,3.4761904761904763
5773513,3,B00D45PSIC,"The DVD is ok, but the CD is not mother goose club, my 2 years old girl doesn't like it.",1395878400,,88,3.45
5773514,5,B00D45PSIC,My one year old  is completely obsessed with these videos. She doesn't watch anything else. She has a DVD for our house and a DVD at her mamaw's house and they have to be on almost every waking hour. She absolutely loves them.,1395705600,,226,4.255813953488372
5773515,5,B00D45PSIC,"My daughter is always asking to watch the ""moose club"" (her pronunciation of Mother Goose Club) DVD. We have used the CD's as well, but she starts looking at the TV wondering where the video is, which invariably leads us back to the DVD. I really like this set, and seems like a good introduction to the Mother Goose Club.",1393113600,,322,4.383333333333334
5773516,1,B00D45PSIC,"Our baby loves the YouTube videos they are fun and educational so we decided to buy this pack to be able to play them offline too. The DVD is ok, it doesn't have the most popular videos from YouTube but it is fine, at least the characters are there, CDs 2 and 3 are Terrible!!!!! They are full of 30 seconds VERY OLD songs (with the original singers and music from two centuries ago in Great Britain), those are really disappointing because don't help the kids to learn new things and be more active, on the contrary they may be scared of listening to an Opera Singer signing about the Duke of York.
CD3 is fine, the songs are nice although are the same from the DVD so basically nothing new here.
I'm really sorry but the price paid is way too high for the product I received",1390780800,4,776,4.25
5773517,5,B00D45PSIC,My 16 mo old grandchild watches this daily.  She seems to enjoy the children.  They are talented.  Their costumes are colorful and appealing.  There is racial balance in the performers.  It is an all around value in the presentation for her to learn the nursery rhymes.,1386979200,,269,4.760869565217392
5773518,4,B00D45PSIC,"My daughter loved the DVD but not a fan of the CDs.  The DVD does not include her fav the wheels on the bus but we purchased the rhyme with us DVD, a big hit.",1382572800,8,158,3.5142857142857142
5773519,1,B00D45PSIC,"This products description is misleading.
It was supposed to have all the video rhymes in 1 pack.
However, there is only one DVD which is video and rest all are CD's with only Audio.
I do not recommend anyone to buy this product.
I think its better value to watch these on you tube for FREE.",1380672000,3,290,4.196428571428571
5773520,5,B00D45PSIC,"After trying many youtube videos for my 12 month old, we found this series that she loved!  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  We don't let her watch TV much, but we will play this when trying to get her to eat.  It is nice, clean, not commercial.  I hope they produce more DVDs!",1376611200,9,282,3.982142857142857
5773531,4,B00D45PSIC,"I bought these after watching them on Netflix. Wanted to listen to the songs in the car. Many of the songs are sung by a single voacalist, NOT the characters in mother goose club.  We think that's a bit disappointing",1443225600,,216,4.4

5773539,1,B00D45PSIC,I was very disappointed with the content of the music CD's.  I do not think that the adult voices chosen are engaging to the little ones.  I also think there is far too much repetition of the same songs.  I would not have purchased them had I heard them before.  They are not of the same quality as the You Tube productions.,1427760000,,324,4.17741935483871
5773540,4,B00D45PSIC,It would have been five stars but there are three music CDs and only one dvd in the pack. I bought the four pack thinking it had actual DVDs in it.,1426896000,,147,3.774193548387097

5773549,5,B00D45PSIC,my daughter loves watching this show on youtube and it was worth the buy to have it on cd to listen to it in the car,1407110400,,116,3.5
5773550,5,B00D45PSIC,"I actually just wanted to purchase one CD for my son to listen to in the car, but I saw that there was a 40% off sale so I took advantage of it. My 19 month old son loves the videos and music and he demands to watch them at least once a day and dances along the whole time. I love that he's learning the same nursery rhymes I learned as a child, and many more that I've never heard. I know they'll help him learn words and numbers and the alphabet. I'm a very happy mom and I plan on purchasing more items in the future!",1402444800,,520,3.824074074074074

8589401,3,B00D45PSIC,Didn't notice that there are less videos in here which I need most for my baby who likes to watch more rather than to listen to the music especially when she's in the car.,1464307200,,171,4.0588235294117645
8589402,2,B00D45PSIC,I made the mistake of thinking this was a DVD four page. My mistake. We already have MP3 of most of the songs (2 albums). But the DVD is not as good as the episodes online. The DVD is a lot of rhymes and less singing.,1461801600,,217,3.739130434782609
8589403,5,B00D45PSIC,My granddaughter loves the Mother Goose Club! This pack comes with a DVD plus 2 cd's with the show songs that my granddaughter can listen to in the car. She loves them!,1459900800,,168,4.28125

8589405,3,B00D45PSIC,"We bought this for the CD's, as my daughter likes to watch the Mother Goose Club on YouTube Kids.  After listening to the first 2 discs, I am not very happy with them.  Most of the songs are not the characters from the show singing, and most of the songs are on 15-30 seconds long.  This generally is because of 2-4 repetitions of a song, they will only do 1-2.

I don't think I would buy this set for someone else as it isn't what I hoped for, but we will still put it into our nursery rhyme rotation as our daughter likes it.",1455494400,,527,4.038461538461538
