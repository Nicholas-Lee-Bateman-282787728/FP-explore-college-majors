8169018,5,B00005B8UC,"I must say that the taxicab confessions are so hillarious.  I will guarantee that you can't find a more entertaining movie, the antics range from drunk guy complaining about people breaking his car to stealing his dogs.  If you buy this and are not happy with it I would buy it off you as it is one of the harder tapes/dvds to come by.",1042243200,,335,4.21875
8169019,4,B00005B8UC,"This show is a shining example of how good television can be when lifted from the constraints of (network) censorship. The various Confessions, taken by hidden cameras inserted strategically in certain taxi cabs, range from pathetic to hilarious to just plain strange. Since the confessions occur in the same group of cabs over the years, the subtle and empathetic interviewing skills of these repeat players, the drivers ""in the know,"" readily emerge. It is all the more remarkable in light of the varied situations they confront. Despite the broad range of story-type, the confessions are all universally entertaining. The fact that they run the entire emotional gamut speaks to the show's depth and ability to entertain on all levels. Almost as entertaining are the clips at the end that reveal the secret and show the passenger finding out they have been taped and signing the release form. You have to wonder why some of these passengers say or do the things they do when they exclaim ""Oh, I've heard of this show!"" or ""This is my favorite ... show!"" Whatever the reason, I, for one, am extremely grateful for their indiscretions.  NOTE: As this is a television program produced by hidden camera in a taxi cab, don't expect any high production values or a ""widescreen"" transfer. But you can expect moving and memorable human stories.  CAUTION: some of the segments contain nudity, and almost every one contains adult language.",992995200,11,1431,4.98326359832636
