8453416,5,B0051ZH6G0,"Volume 9 contains episode 287 of Prisoner Cell Block H which marks the entrance of one of TV soap's Superbitches - Joan ""The Freak"" Ferguson. Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick) will go on to spend 100's of episodes terrorising the ladies of Wentworth and causing havoc for colleagues in her bid to claim her ultimate prize - Governorship.
This 32 episode set contains episodes 257 - 288 and we see Meg Morris (Elspeth Ballantyne) and Colleen Powell (Judith McGrath) vying for the newly vacated position of Deputy Governor following the departure of Jim Fletcher (Gerard Maguire). Meg's homelife is not as rosey as it has been - would the position of deputy governor really help things at home?
The Powell family are thrown into chaos when daughter Jenny disappears. New employee at Wentworth Ian Mahoney seems to have an eye for a particular officer or two. Will he end up down the aisle with one of them?
The powerful storyline involving Kate Petersen (Olivia Hamnett) reaches a dramatic conclusion but where is Sandy Edwards (Louise Le Nay)? Erica's (Patsy King) hairstyle is certainly more 1982 than her previous effort.
We see the return of Helen Smart (Caroline Gillmer) and Chrissie Latham (Amanda Muggleton), new prisoners include Faye Quin (Anne Lucas), Susie Driscoll and Carol Colsen.
Which lady has the attentions of Steve Fawkner (Wayne Jarrett)? Judy Bryant (Betty Bobbitt) is out and celebrates with her daugher Lori (Susannah Fowle). This leads to another meeting with her old enemy Jock Stewart (Tommy Dysart) with shocking results.
Witness Joan's black glove treatment for the first time, watch hero Steve become a firefighter, plus much much more!
Originally screened in early 1982 in Australia, these epsiodes hit UK screens on ITV from early 1989 onwards.
Wentworth won't be the same again from episode 287!",1332720000,,1822,5.096989966555184
