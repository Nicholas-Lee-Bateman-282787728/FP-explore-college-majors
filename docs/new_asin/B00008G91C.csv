7983740,2,B00008G91C,"I usually really like episodes by Secrets of the Dead, but this one annoyed me. It gives three possible ways that the fire started: Nero set it, it was an accident, and the Christians set it to fulfill a prophesy. Yeah...and they had a death wish.

7983741,5,B00008G91C,"""The Great Fire of Rome"" seeks to answer the question of just how the fire of 64 AD began.  Was it just an accident, caused by the cramped living conditions in the ""poor quarter"" of ancient Rome?  Was it the devious emperor Nero, who wanted to build glorious palaces and other buildings in the heart of Rome (but didn't have the room)?  Or was it a mysterious new religious cult, called ""Christians,"" who had recently sprung up in Rome and sometimes caused trouble?
The program seeks to answer this question, and there seems to be some evidence for each case.  Some Roman historians blamed Nero, and wrote that he ""fiddled"" while Rome burned.  But this is far from true, and Nero actually was active in trying to stop the spread of the fire.  So if it wasn't Nero, was it an accident?  It could have been, as there were plenty of flammable objects in the area, especially in the slums of Rome.  But is it also possible that the Christians, seeking the beginning of the ""end times,"" had something to do with the mysterious fire?
The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions, but the program is excellent nonetheless.  Just the prospect of ""Christians as arsonists"" is intriguing enough!
