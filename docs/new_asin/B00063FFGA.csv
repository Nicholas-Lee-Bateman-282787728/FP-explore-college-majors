2163705,1,B00063FFGA,None of these movies should be considered to be in any horror category. All of these movies lacked the concept of horror.,1356393600,5,121,4.545454545454546
2163706,5,B00063FFGA,"An excellent batch of horror movies.  I own most of these movies, if not all.  Some of them are old goodies, but super horror movies.  If one likes back in the day horror such as, ""Carnival of Souls"", then this collection is for you.  That movie is creepy, which my daughter and I enjoyed as well.  One does not have to have a bucket of gore for a movie to scare and creep you out.  A few of the movies such as, ""Fangs of the Living Dead"", ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""The Undertaker and His Pals"", do have some blood and some gore in it. This set is not disappointing at all, and well worth buying.

The sound is pretty good and the movies so far look fine.",1351036800,12,662,4.046153846153846
2163707,1,B00063FFGA,Pure crap.  These films are are of poor quality and probably were never that good to begin with.  Several of the films are hardly viewable and several more just aren't worth viewing.,1318550400,3,182,4.65625
2163708,4,B00063FFGA,"B movie horror classics.  The original low-budget films from the 1950's and 60's. Night of the Living Dead,  Carnival of Souls,  House on Haunted Hill - loved these movies when I was a kid. These 3 classics were remade recently with big Hollywood budgets and the remakes are LAME.  See the great originals here for a low price.  Also includes Francis Ford Coppola's first feature (low budget) film - Dementia 13.",1271548800,4,412,4.746478873239437
2163709,5,B00063FFGA,"As evil as Wal""Marx"" is, I couldn't pass up this gem for $5. This a seriously great collection of horror classics such as: Night of the Living Dead, House On Haunted Hill, Dario Argento's Deep Red, House By the Cemetery, Carnival of Souls, and many more.

However, the quality of the transfer is intentionally poor. It looks like you're watching it as it was in a theatre the first time it came out, which definitely adds character. So if you're wanting a crystal clear picture, this isn't for you.

If you are a horror fan, this is a must have collection for such a low price.",1260316800,7,577,4.433962264150943

2163716,5,B00063FFGA,"As public domain movie collections go, HORROR: DO NOT WATCH ALONE (15 films) has a superior selection of creepers! NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD- The all-time classic, low-budget, flesh-eating zombie masterwork by George Romero still holds up today! Gritty, claustrophobic, and gruesome, it manages to provide social commentary along w/ its more visceral elements. HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL- Vincent Price (THE BAT, FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER, THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES) chews through scenery like nobody's business, playing host to a group of ""contestants"", trapped for a hellish night in the title abode. Co-stars the ever-lovely, Carol Ohmart (SPIDER BABY) as his acidic wife. A glorious hunk of 50's cheeeze! CARNIVAL OF SOULS- Candace Hilligoss (THE CURSE OF THE LIVING CORPSE) is a young survivor of an automobile accident, who slowly finds herself in a nightmare world of dread and doom. This one creeps up on you! The scenes at the abandoned carnival are unforgettable! I BURY THE LIVING-  A cemetery caretaker (Richard Boone), just might have the power to cause people to die, simply by pushing a pin in a burial plot map!  Unfortunately, a wonderful supernatural atmosphere is almost ruined by an absurd ending. Still worth seeing though. BLOOD TIDE- A rather dull sea-monster film, starring James Earl Jones. Ancient lore comes to life as the creature arises, demanding virgin female sacrifice! Alas, it sounds much better than it actually is! Beautiful Greek scenery though! FANGS OF THE LIVING DEAD- Anita Ekberg (THE FRENCH SEX MURDERS, THE KILLER  NUN) stars in this Spanish / Italian production, as a woman who could be the descendant of a vampire named Malenka. Actually, the women in this movie are so beautiful, it's difficult to follow the story! Vampire babes running wild, yeah! BLOODY PIT OF HORROR- Ridiculous tale about a group of fashion models and their photographer, who trespass into a castle for some glamour shots. Terror ensues when a madman begins killing them off, believing himself to be fulfilling an ancient curse. Silly and boring to the extreme, try not to get caught under its thud! THE UNDERTAKER AND HIS PALS- True 60's, cult-grindhouse schlock! Bikers hunt down women to add to a diner's menu! Meanwhile, business is booming for their buddy the undertaker! Hilarious in spots, it also includes a catchy theme song! NIGHTMARE CASTLE- Horror goddess, Barbara Steele (CASTLE OF BLOOD, BLACK SUNDAY, SHE BEAST) plays a dual role as both the new bride of a sadistic madman, and the vengeful ghost of the wife he murdered! Ms. Steele is brilliant throughout! DEMENTIA 13- A macabre mystery, featuring an axe-murderer on the loose, as a woman attempts to bamboozle her dead husband's family! Dark, loony, and fun! COUNT DRACULA AND HIS VAMPIRE BRIDES (aka: THE SATANIC RITES OF DRACULA) - Christopher Lee reprises his role as the Count, this time set on destroying mankind by releasing a super-plague virus! Peter Cushing is Van Helsing, once again, on the trail of his elusive adversary. AB FAB alert! Co-stars Joanna Lumley! THE LAST MAN ON EARTH- Vincent Price is the title character, up against hordes of vampire-zombies, after a plague has wiped out the world's human population. Grim and bleak, w/ a nice twist at the end. THE PYX (aka: THE HOOKER CULT MURDERS)- One of the better devil movies, this has Christopher Plummer as a cop investigating the murder of a prostitute named Elizabeth Lucy (Karen Black- TV's TRILOGY OF TERROR, BURNT OFFERINGS, HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES). As he delves into the mystery, he is challenged by the apparent supernatural events involved. The finale is perfectly sinister! THE GHOST- Barbara Steele gets to play the murderer this time, killing her husband, who just won't stay dead! No one plays wicked like Ms. Steele, and she blazes here! This collection is ready-made for that Halloween grab-bag!...",1442620800,7,3864,5.062794348508635

2163720,4,B00063FFGA,"Not what I was expecting but I've come to love it! Several of the movies are very poor quality. Looks like they've been recorded off of old VHS tapes. Some of them are just the best of the cheesy old horror movies. Then there are the classic few. House on Haunted Hill, Carnival of Souls, Blood Tide, Night of the Living Dead and Dominique! All in all it was worth the few dollars I spent on it.",1426723200,4,395,4.142857142857143
2163721,2,B00063FFGA,"I was rather disappointed.  Four of the movies, I already own.  The rest are not all that great.  Although some old horror movies (50 years old or more) are considered classics, there have been some made that are complete duds.",1420588800,2,227,4.625

2163728,3,B00063FFGA,"I emailed TGG Direct(The Garr Group Direct). They only carry this set as 15 movies now. I was hoping some Amazon.com sellers would still have the 20 movie version in their inventory. Sadly I tried two different sellers. Both sold me the 15 movie one,so despite it being only 15 movies it does have some decent titles like The Pyx,The Undertaker and His Pals&I Bury The Living.",1371600000,,376,4.626865671641791
