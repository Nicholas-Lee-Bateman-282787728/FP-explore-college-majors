8059952,4,B0009F4OW6,What a beautiful celebration of love.  I got some good ideas and inspiration from this wedding.,1191801600,,95,4.9375
8059953,4,B0009F4OW6,"Some people like saint James are just haters. Yes, the wedding was over the top at some points but I heard Prophetess Bynum say that her love for Bishop Weeks was once in a lifetime so her wedding was going to be a once in a lifetime wedding. It was not a traditional ceremony at all but I think that's the reason I appreciated it so much. If you truly understand everything Prophetess Bynum has been through, you would understand how everything in her life is a miracle. Just a word of caution for everyone. When you say something negative about a man or woman of God, you'd better be 100% positive about what you're  saying.",1171238400,,626,4.396551724137931

This wedding video is beautiful and shows the beauty of love and marraige.  The DVD is high quality and the ceremony was nicely orchestrated.  It was an extremely classy affair.

Futhermore, what Prophetess Juanita Bynum, a preacher who happens to have been an investor and multiple business owner BEFORE she was a world-famous preacher, does with her money is no one's business.  That is between her, her new husband and God.

She is blessed financially because she understands the biblical principles of sowing and reaping.  She has sown bountifully into the kingdom and people of God and she has reaped boutifully.  She is a very giving and charitable woman and she deserved something special for HERSELF!

If you like a good love story or need ideas for your upcoming wedding, then this video is a must have!

Go ahead Juanita!!!",1146009600,8,989,4.792899408284024
8059955,2,B0009F4OW6,"It is clear. Juanita Bynum-Weeks has good taste and a sense of what to do with a lot of money. I will not critique her choice to spend soooo much money on a public show (Juanita and Thomas were already married at the time of this ceremony). What does suprise me is all of the Old Testament and extra biblical symbols of covenant that they thought necessary for this retake of a sacred ceremony.

I couldn't help but laugh when (as I predicted) The newly declared Mrs. Weeks began to shout, dance and run at the altar as her husband tries to keep up with this display of emotion and spiritual exercise that always accompanies a Juanita Bynum meeting.

What is really obnoxious is Mrs. Weeks' need to ""spiritualize"" the desire for wedding rings on her left and right hands. She told the Lord that she wanted both of her hands to be married (All this based on a passage in Proverbs). I'm suprised that the prophetess did not understand that her hands are married because SHE is married; not because she has a ring on her finger. A comic high point for me is observing Juanita directing things from the altar.

This DVD chronicles a long, boring and poorly photographed event that happened after the couple consumated their original wedding vows. It is narrated by Pastor Richard Hogue who often hosts Mrs. Weeks on the TBN talk show. (I can hear Johnny Mathis and Deniece Williams in the back of my mind...""Too much to little to late....). I believe Mrs. Weeks' ring is near 8 carats large. It is stunningly beautiful. It's hard to believe that this ring is on the hand of the one who instructs people to give their last dimes, shoes and locks of hair to the Trinity Broadcasting Network with the promise of ""double anointings"" and the prosperity of God. Hmmmmmmm  Juanita, please tell me that this diamond is not of African origin; where your ethnic brothers and sisters are having their hands and arms chopped off in the name of shiny little stones. Since you claim that the Lord gave you the design and format for your wedding I trust that the Lord knows how many people die from the diamond trade in Africa and instructed you and Thomas accordingly. Let's pray that it is a Canadian or at least a Russian diamond.

I'm sure that the blind devotees of Bynum-Weeks will think it's straight from the Throne Room but to most folk like me it is only an sanctified excuse to spend too much money for the lust of the eyes and the pride of life.

Do Not, I Repeat, Don't Waste Your Money.",1143072000,17,2481,4.490022172949002
