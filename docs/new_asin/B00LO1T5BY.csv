Dvd photo cover deceptive. Not one big happy family. Description also deceptive. Not much about the railroad at all. Was expecting an upbeat James Garner movie instead wanted to hang myself at the end!",1432944000,,246,5.0
8667075,5,B00LO1T5BY,"This was filmed in my hometown and I am an extra in this movie, so I'm a bit partial with my ratings. I bought it to show my kids.",1428537600,,130,3.5172413793103448
8667076,5,B00LO1T5BY,"This movie is memorable for me. Maybe because James Garner's character works with trains, which I love. I saw this movie years ago, but never forgot it. The small-town appeals to me, and all the characters are memorable. I'm glad I decided to look for here on Amazon, and ordered it immediately. Of course, anything with James Garner is worth the purchase.",1426291200,3,356,4.758064516129032
8667077,3,B00LO1T5BY,Good story but a limited telling when compared with the book. Always enjoy James Garner's performances though.,1422144000,,110,5.529411764705882
