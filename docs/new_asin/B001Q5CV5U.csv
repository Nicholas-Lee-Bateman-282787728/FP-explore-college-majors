8335013,3,B001Q5CV5U,"OK early 60's Argentine-Paraguayan, Spanish-language (no dubbing or subtitles) production.  A voluptuous village girl, the object of the local men's desire, falls in love with a professional criminal and sacrifices all for him.  Stars Isabel Sarli and Armando Bo, who also produced.  Has a little bit of the usual Isabel Sarli nudity which became more prevalent in her later films.  Has some beautiful atmospheric local music.  In color and the DVD quality is OK but the film needs re-mastering, but is unlikely to get it.  Recommended for Isabel Sarli fans.",1458432000,,558,5.144444444444445
