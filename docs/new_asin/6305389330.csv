""VR.5"" is possibly the most enigmatic show since ""The Prisoner"", because it challenges its viewers to think while providing characters one comes to care about.  Lori Singer (""Footloose"" and ""Fame: The Series"") plays Sydney Bloom, an employee of TelCal whose knack for computers and Virtual Reality (or VR) changes her life.  She shares her adventures with her childhood friend Duncan (Michael Easton) and two mentors: Dr. Frank Morgan (Will Patton) and Oliver Sampson (Anthony Head).
This was - and still is - a cutting edge sci-fi/thriller series which originally aired from March 1995 to May 1995 with only 13 episodes produced.  But in this case, 13 is a very lucky number.
If you love mysteries and want something challenge your mind, check it out.  But remember; nothing and nobody is what they seem.

I found the ending to be shocking~if you were watching  the show from the begining like I was~you would to. I feel that this  episode really shows Lori Singer's actting ablity. I only wish that this  show would have stayed on the air longer. I highly suggest you buy this.  The Sci-Fi network was airing re-runs but that too my taken off the air. If  you could watch just one video of the VR 5 series then I suggest it be this  one.",964828800,,585,4.0
