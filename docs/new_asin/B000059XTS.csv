1409955,3,B000059XTS,"I'm not going to say that this is the best version of Macbeth that I have ever seen. I'm just saying that it was ok. In my opinion, whoever made this production should have cast someone who actually did Shakespeare. I don't even know if Jeremy Brett and Piper Laurie have ever done Shakespeare. The set is gorgeous. Something tells me that you had to be brave to stand on the ramp above the stage. Macduff Jr. is so adorable. I was saddened when the Murderers killed him offstage. I was so sad when I heard him crying offstage at the end of the scene. The biggest highlight of the video (I rented it from the library) was the Witches. I liked the Witches even more when I found out that one of the actresses playing the Witches also played Bianca in this series' production of Othello. She's better at being evil than good. What especially charmed me about the witches was their costumes. I was expecting old chambermaid costumes or rags. I was also expecting old women, not sexy women. Then, there were the three demons, or apparitios as they are credited. They were freaky. I was especially charmed because the witches and the apparations appear more than once. Watch for them. They're pretty prominent. Other than that, just rent the DVD for the Witches, Macduff Jr. and the set. There is too much overacting from the leading players. They almost killed this DVD. Everyone else is good except for Malcolm. They obviously hired this guy because his chest is sexy.",1036886400,9,1465,4.595419847328245
1409956,1,B000059XTS,"I teach this play in High School and was looking for an alternative to the Welles and Polanski versions to help my students understand the play. This is not it. This one is horrible. Badly acted and directed and very difficult to follow. If anyone is looking for a video version of this play that is easy to understand and useful for teachers, there is a pretty new version of the play on DVD available on this site directed by J. Bretton Truett and E.J. Kerwin ( B0000639O1 ) that is outstanding for educators. They perform most of the play and include a great deal of video analysis as well.  The performances are very good and they  use a modern setting which is very effective. There is also a wonderful feature that lets you get right to the text from the video and back again.",1018656000,48,782,4.386206896551724
1409957,1,B000059XTS,"Unfortunately, I have to agree with just about everyone else who has reviewed here this film production of ""Macbeth.""  I found the video in my local library and was eagerly anticipating another fine performance by two of my favorite actors: Brett and Piper Laurie, especially Brett.  I've seen and thoroughly enjoyed every one of the BBC Sherlock Holmes productions numerous times, and just recently was impressed with Brett's interpretation of Bassanio in the '73 TV production of ""The Merchant of Venice.""  So, imagine my great disappointment when I was amazed by how awful this ""Macbeth"" really is.  I would prefer to not fault the actors, but can only think that the director and producer were responsible.  Not to mention the costumer and the ""set"" designer.  I would strongly advise anyone who loves Shakespeare, Brett or Laurie, or all of the above, to avoid a most unpleasant experience.",978393600,20,895,5.054421768707483
7934502,5,B000059XTS,"A superb production! Jeremy Brett in his prime gives a masterful performance, a brilliant psychological portrayal, and the entire cast is excellent. If you love Shakespeare and/or Jeremy Brett, please ignore any bad reviews. You will love this film! I am so glad it was still available.",1394409600,,286,5.1063829787234045
7934503,1,B000059XTS,"First, you can watch this train wreck for free through Google video.

Second, find it and watch the ending just so you see Brett's ridiculous Macbeth costume. His tights look like cheap, ill-fitting long underwear with the crotch almost down to his knees. This is during the final scenes where he spits death in the eye, so it's pretty hysterical. With the fakey swords being waved around it brings to mind children horsing around in the backyard.",1340409600,,447,4.805194805194805
7934504,5,B000059XTS,"Macbeth--The Shakespeare Collection on VHS is the very best film adaptation of ""The Scots Play"" available for teaching high school students. Because it is faithful to the text and performed in an Elizabethan-style theater, as well as being very well acted, students absolutely connect to the story, complete with the blood, images of light and dark, and power struggles.  The interpretation of the witches gives new meaning to the Weird Sisters!",1289692800,2,445,5.267605633802817
7934505,2,B000059XTS,"I knew the quality -- or lack thereof -- of this video before I bought it.  Though I wasn't impressed with the acting or filmography, I have used it as a 12th grade English teacher because it follows Shakespeare's play and wording so precisely.  In that way, it serves its purpose.  Unfortunately for me, when I switched schools, the video stayed behind at my old school, so I bought a replacement.

While watching Act IV, I was shocked to find that over five minutes of a very crucial part is -- Missing!  The segment where Malcom tests MacDuff by claiming that he is vile, greedy, and licentious has been removed.  We go directly from the end of Act III to the middle of MacDuff's grief on hearing of the loss of his family.

I know the rest of the play was there.  I have watched it for six years.  This obviously is a flaw in the transfer to DVD.  I don't know if it was just my copy, but I doubt it.

All in all, my main complaint is the sloppy recording, the darkness of the picture (I know, MacBeth is a ""dark"" tragedy, but there was more light in my old copy), and the absence of a crucial part of Act IV.  I guess I will stop the DVD next year and tell my students what happened in the interim.

Of course, I could borrow the old VHS from my old school and make my own DVD.  I think I could make a better copy.",1260921600,3,1319,4.1015625
7934506,5,B000059XTS,"I read other reviews before purchasing and was sufficiently cautious to purchase this on VHS - since the cost is so much lower than the DVD.  And though I agree with many of the reviewers that overall the performances in this production are amateurish - have no doubt that Brett's performance is reason enough to make the purchase.  And since he is the one acting Macbeth he is the one on screen most of the time. His portrayal is brilliant.  He is mesmerizing, and fans of his work will not be disappointed.  Piper Laurie, on the other hand, embarasses herself with her performance as Lady Macbeth. If you still have a VHS player then I recommend you buy that format - it is on two tapes.",1258329600,5,689,4.444444444444445
7934507,1,B000059XTS,"Fans of the absolutely wonderful Sherlock Holmes series starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes, and David Burke and Edward Hardwicke as Watson undoubtably long for more examples of the deceased Brett's distinct, eccentric intelligence.

Brett has been gone for 13 years now, and there are very few filmed examples of his work. There are even less currently available on DVD or VHS in America.

But one in-print choice we have foisted on us is a mysterious cheapo 1981 LA production of ""Macbeth"" - starring Jeremy Brett as the Big Guy! Sounds promising - maybe unbeatable - but, alas.

Piper Laurie, as Lady Macbeth, is desperately bad. I thought I recognized her as one of the stars of ""Designing Women"" or ""Golden Girls."" I now believe myself wrong, but the fact that she PLAYS Lady Macbeth like a Golden Girl or a Designing Woman speaks for it's campy ackward hysterical self.

Jeremy Brett is effective at scenes and soliloquies involving self-doubt, self-hate and fear. I was transfixed at these brief moments. But he also had a nasty tick of licking his lips, glaring his teeth and losing me instantly.

The other supporting actors are uniformly bad. Many peripheral characters (what we see in movie credits today listed as ""panicky intermediary #3"") are LA bimbos that are waiting for That Phone Call. The three witches are (as another reviewer cleverly stated) rather ""funky"", looking like stage-ins for a Banarama stage show. At least they looked like they were having fun, swaying back and forth as untalented witches do. When the witches prophesize that Macbeth will be the Thaine of Cordor, and that Banquo will be the father of kings though he will not be one - these prophecies are the crux/prediction/whole darn point of the entire play. I wish the director had thought to have the witches say these rather important lines on stage, instead of behind the stage in muffled echo. With the poor VHS to DVD transfer, and the poor original choreography, you can't hear the damn witches. But! They dance. And can they dance! Disco inferno-style!

Banquo is reasonably well-played, in that the actor seems to understand the rhyme of Shakespeare's writing. He's compelling - even if he looks like Che Guevara trying to settle down and start a family. Which points up another screw-up - the costume design is poor, unflattering to the body, and all-around crummy.

I cannot share impressions on the stage direction, as I am convinced there was none.

So it's insufferable campy failure. I've watched it twice - never made it past Banquo's ghost at the supper. If you should see this film, you may fight the urge to hate Shakespeare ever more, but if you watch - and better yet own - the brilliant Ian McKellan & Judy Dench production (filmed in England by people who know Shakespeare), you will again see the true perfect bloody power of what I believe to be one of history's greatest plays.",1206835200,2,2889,4.834008097165992
7934508,5,B000059XTS,"you know i've seen many renditions of Macbeth and in some plays he comes off almost as a Hamletlike Macbeth,(conflicted to abstraction)In this version he comes off just plain MEAN!! His wife mean and cold. Actually the worse the acting job in portraying this hellish couple,the more real to life. They just aren't likable people,brutal and agressive. However this version did cut out the critical scene when MacDuff tries to sway the English power against Macbeth. This is important because no matter how bad Macbeth is,the English worry that Macduff could be worse,so they put Macduff through a test of character. To the English,Macbeth is ""the Devil we know"",as opposed to the one we don,t. This is a major scene in the play and to omit it is a mistake. But the good note is that the Hell porter man is there in all fullness complete with drunken accents.",1170720000,5,857,4.758389261744966
7934509,3,B000059XTS,"I picked up this DVD to help my son to supplement his reading of the play for his high school Lit class. The play is staged quite simply, and is shot basically the way one would see it on stage, with few tracking shots or camera tricks. The set is quite spare -- a few columns here and there for the actors to walk around. The costuming is simple and mostly traditional.

The back of the DVD claims that the actors avoid speaking in English accents, which is supposedly an aid to American listeners. Frankly, this did not help me much, as some of the actors still spoke in ""stagey"" English and not in contemporary accents. The production stayed very close to the written play, which was suitable to the purpose I had in mind -- give me a sense of the play without lots of adaptations and scene cutting.

I thought Jeremy Brett did a fine and muscular job as Macbeth. However, I often found Piper Laurie (as Lady Macbeth) hard to understand. The witches and their familiars get more stage time than a reading of the play might suggest. This does not detract from the action, but suggests the continuing presence of their malign influence on Macbeth and others. The rest of the cast was quite competent and intelligible.

I don't agree completely with the very low ratings given by many reviewers. This Macbeth is a workmanlike and straightforward rendering of ""The Scottish Tragedy."" Taken for what it is, it is quite acceptable, if not exemplary.",1168214400,5,1446,4.596899224806202
7934510,1,B000059XTS,"Method actress Piper Laurie made me laugh out loud when she began the ""Come you spirits"" speech as if she were trying to summon Blanche DuBois and Medea in one go.  Can't imagine Mr. Brett's excuse for as abysmally poor acting.  For even worse Shakespearean acting (and yes, it's not the same as playing any other texts) see two Star Trekkers (Ohura and the Russian guy) and a General Hospital star (Luke) in this series' ""Antony and Cleopatra"".  Not a larfing matter in the end.",1150848000,3,479,4.6117647058823525
7934511,1,B000059XTS,"I love Jeremy Brett and Piper Laurie. Their combined talents offer what few enjoyable moments there are to be found in this Macbeth, but they unfortunately can't salvage this atrocious production. Seeing it is enough to turn someone off Shakespeare. (Should that happen, Al Pacino's delightful LOOKING FOR RICHARD is the perfect antidote to restore passion for the Bard). But I digress. I want to issue a warning to all who might assume the DVD version of this Macbeth would be superior to the VHS. In this instance, tape was simply transferred unto disk with no remastering or enhancements, and there are no extra features. The visual and audio quality is appalling. I regret buying this DVD when I already owned the VHS (..like I said, I love Jeremy Brett...) The only advantage is being able to skip the boring parts to get to the monologues. But that isn't saying much.",1051056000,25,873,4.788079470198675
