8322202,5,B001MVYUX4,"I have seen a ton of Peach DVDs. Anyone who has familiarity with Peach knows that the vids in its enormous catalog range from super sexy to sort of dull. You never know what to expect, and I knew that I was playing Russian Roulette again by buying this one.

The end result, though, was a magic bullet that fired off the best Peach production that I've ever seen.

There aren't a lot of names to draw you in--in fact cover girl Clara G is the only one of the seven women (eight vignettes) that I've ever even heard of, and I know more names in this business than the average viewer. But don't for a second think that that means that the quality of models is lacking. Every single one of these girls is top-rung, gorgeous faces and phenomenal bodies. No flat butts anywhere (sometimes a problem with Peach); also most of the women don't have breast implants which is a big plus for a lot of viewers.

The photography direction and editing are great; I am singing the praises because there is ample attention paid of these ladies' bodies from all angles, and the  shots dont' get too locked down on one body part. GREAT and copious shots of some really beautiful butts here. I have complained about this mightily, but what hurts a lot of soft-core releases is, for whatever reason, the directors seem to forget that the back side of a woman even exists at all. The female derriere has made the hard-core world turn on its axis for about the last decade; you would think that the soft-core world would have caught on by now that men like to see that.

But  the biggest plus--and I found myself astounded by this--is the ample amount of explicit, in-your-face, below-the-belt nudity. Not so much as maybe a Penthouse release, but way more than anything that you'd see from Playboy. It isnt' there in the first couple of vignettes but by the time that you get to the third one, look out! These aren't fleeting glances shot in total darkness, but obvious, lingering views of the nether regions. What a pleasant surprise from a company that more often than not gets very dodgy when it comes to that area of the body.",1370736000,4,2109,4.479166666666667
