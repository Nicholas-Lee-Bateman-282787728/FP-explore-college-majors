""Singin' with the Saints"" features the Homecoming friends backing up a number of groups; including ensembles made up from the Homecoming Friends cast, The Martins, The Gaither Vocal Band, The Talleys, The Cathedral Quartet, and The Isaacs. Other featured artists include: Jessy Dixon and Jan Buckner. I especially enjoyed the number ""It is Finished"" as sung by Bill, Gloria, and Danny Gaither, with Guy Penrod.

This program was recorded at the Gaither Studios in Alexandria, Indiana in 1998. These early videos radiate the close-knit bond of Christian love experienced in a family Homecoming reunion, a profound sense of love for Southern Gospel Music and an awesome appreciation and respect for fellow performers. The pure joy of the gift of music, the truth of the message, and the skill and talent of the performers all play a part in the impressive success of this program, as well as in every concert produced in the Homecoming series.",1315958400,2,1170,4.959183673469388

I cannot say that I like all the songs. There are three in a row that I do not care much for; However, overall, I do like this DVD.

The Singin' With the Saints song is fun, and there is another song that touched me so much that it made me cry. Now, I am not a Western fan and never bought a Roy Acuff record in my life, but I know who he was. and heard him sing when I was growning up.  Gloria tells a little story about him, which is followed by Jake Hess with a related song, and it is a beautiful thing to watch. The song is titled: ""I Know Where I Am."" It could not be lovlier.

So, in spite of the skipping I may do in the future, I will be listening to this DVD many times more. I definitely recommend it. And some of you will like those songs that I skip, ~so you might keep this in mind.
