2536772,5,B000EULSSY,"Amazing to read the two reviews below, one of whom thinks he's been dead for two years (!) and the other who...well...can't even spell his name but still thinks he's dead. Jim is alive and well, touring with Dave Attell, ripping it up on O&E and will no doubt be his sick, brilliant self on HBO's LUCKY LOUIE this summer (with the equally disturbed Louis CK). Pretty prolific for a corpse, y'think?

His performance on One Night Stand was typical Jim Norton - sick, twisted and flat out hysterical and I'm glad I can replace my videotape with a proper DVD. Killer price, too.",1147564800,7,575,4.528846153846154
2536773,5,B000EULSSY,"Jim Norton brings a no holds barred approach to his comedy and it shows in his HBO ""One Night Stand"" special.  This DVD will be packed to the gills with special features including...

- Audio commentary from ""Pat From Moonachie"" and Edward Norton

- Forty five minutes of deleted material including the infamous butterscotch sniffing scene

- Video introduction from Andrew Dice Clay

- Anthony Cumia bow outtakes with audio commentary from Anthony himself

- ""Behind the Laughter"" featurette where comedian Jim Norton discusses his unusual childhood including his experiences with ""monster rain""

- Various promos including the ""War of the Cumias"" theatrical trailer

At least Mr. Norton had the smarts to clean up the crime scene even though he used his own tongue after desposing of the dead tranny's virus riddled corpse.

I stared at myself in the mirror and had that creepy feeling like the first time you pleasured yourself with some help from Scraps.  I didn't feel that way from all the fantasizing I had just had about Jimmy.  I think it was from the 8 White Castle Clam Strip sandwiches and the 12 Rolling Rock nips I just drank.

His ability to hate himself more than any critic ever could is his saving grace;not only on this DVD, but in life as well. When a man can allow himself to peed upon freely, is he not truly his own master?

The DVD is shot at a well known tranny park-n-ride just outside Mantown, a place Lil Jimmy frequents and rumor has it is the birth place of ""Monster Rain"", Lil Jimmy's favorite past time. In this DVD there are a few great cameos, Robert Reed bareing the imfamous Robe and bowl of luke-warm broth, Fredarica Bimmel""Would JA"", and last but not least Helen, bee hive and all. This DVD made me Laff, cry and punch my wife for being to mouthy.

Anyway, in this delightful romp through the bath-houses of yore, we get to see the late Mr. Norton do his enthralling ""Greed is good"" speech, his saucy Jamie Gumm dance (AKA ""The Tuck"") and, for all of you animal-lovers out there, his rambunctious mule-shaving routine. And sistahs, you ain't lived `til you've gotten yo'self a gander at MC Jimmy takin' off his hat and rappin' in funky-fresh full effect in ""da house""--he's quite the def gangsta, if I may...be so bold, sir.

In the supplements, Mr. Norton is our chatty guide on a tour of the multitidinous Kaposi's sarcomas all over his otherwise pale pale belly (ironically, one of the lesions looks exactly like a map of Hawaii!) Veteran newsman Chris Hansen grants us a wonderful ""behind-the-scenes"" glimpse of the making of what was to have been Jimmy's first animated feature: ""Casper Meets Jonbenet and Li'l Conner""! (Sadly, budget over-runs, not to mention Megan's Law violations, led to that project's abandonment.) A commentary track is also included, featuring Norton and his colleagues Jimmy Robinson and a woman known only as Helen, with a surprise appearance by Gene Simmons' wig. My one quibble is that this track is really for die-hard Jimmy completists only, as much of it seems to be comprised of microphone tests and the sound of a fly unzipping followed by a vigorous gurgling throat sound ""Huuulllulllulllluuuullll"".

2536822,5,B000EULSSY,"Jimmy Robinson's life was full of tragedy right up to that fateful day last autumn when the 69 lb man passed away. Jimmy's life of tragedy started when he was very young. He was once playing under his front porch with his childhood friend, Conner, when a monster rainstorm rip his mobile home right off the cement slab and exposed both children to the storm. Little Conner held on to Jimmy as long as he could, but only moments later he was gone. Jimmy discovered the body of his best and only friend 3 months later while fishing with his father, Scott P. Robinson. This is what triggered many of Jimmy's problems.

In late 2004 Jimmy was taking a nap a rest area when suddenly a man knocked on his window. The man, Robert, Simply stated ""It's cold outside."" Jimmy knew exactly what to do. Shortly before his death Jimmy was asked how he was coping with the ravaging disease, to which he replied angrily, ""It stinks, and I don't like it."" immediately after he hacked a little blood onto his robe.

My wife, Frederika, and I could not stop crying when this feature was over. He thanked his meal tickets, Ron (opie) Howard and a fellow AIDs victim, Stallone. After which he fell limp on the stage with a puddle of his own blood soaking into his purple robe.

Sadly, with Jimmy's disease ravaging his once meaty body, we are hopeful to see him around the holidays, even if he has to come in his robe.

2536837,5,B000EULSSY,"It seems like only yesterday when I heard the news of Jimmy's passing. Watching his DVD brought only sadness, knowing the lifestyle the audience seems to find so funny robbed the Earth of this man far before his time. Listen and try to laugh at Jim reliving the day he was diagnosed with AIDS; explaining to his husband Robert that his trip to Germany probably killed them both; getting high in Mantown, only to wake up 36 hours later naked and bleeding in a New Jersey rest stop; meeting Chris Reeve and telling the parapalegic Mr. Reeve that ""he deserved it"" for refusing to take a picture with him; and finally coming to grips that he will die alone and will have never met the inspirational Liz Taylor to (what might well have been his last words, since this was filmed just two days before his death) ""slap the cancer wig off of her head into a mud puddle"".

I recommend this DVD to anyone who has a loved one dealing with the horrible epidemic known as AIDS. You'll cry yourself to sleep after watching this poor man struggle to do what he loves one last time: make people laugh.

I fondly remember his many appearances on ""The Tony Danza Show."" I think perhaps my favorite of Jim's appearances was the one in which he rode out on the stage on Tony's mule, while the audience shouted ""Extravadanza!""

He really proved his dramatic chops though, with his role in Hallmark's TV movie, ""Riding the Bus with My Sister."" His portrayal of Rosie O'Donnell's ""special"" friend was phenomenal, to say the least, and their love making scenes were both passionate and poignant.

I recommend this product to anyone who enjoys trolling middle schools, killing prostitutes, or laughing at retards.  MAKES A GREAT BIRTHDAY GIFT!

P.S. To clear up the issue of has James passed on, yes it is true James died in April of this year.  There has been much confusion the past few years because he hospitalized several times due to his battle with AIDS.

He has since been honing his comic chops in the clubs on the east coast and this performance shows Norton at his most contagious, to the point of an epidemic.  The same way that every festering sore is truly unique, Nortons humor goes belly to belly causing drastic broth spit takes throughout the oft-robed audience.

It seems like only yesterday that we were playing under the porch, and now they have released his farewell HBO special.  Jimmy loved life, but his self-destructive lifestyle caused him to be stolen from us too soon.  He is survived by his life-partner Steve who helped with the release of this DVD.

 He's not DEAD, you idiots., May 14, 2006

Reviewer: William Holmes ""...I've got my own thumb, thanks anyway"" (New York) - See all my reviews

Amazing to read the two reviews below, one of whom thinks he's been dead for two years (!) and the other who...well...can't even spell his name but still thinks he's dead. Jim is alive and well, touring with Dave Attell, ripping it up on O&E and will no doubt be his sick, brilliant self on HBO's LUCKY LOUIE this summer (with the equally disturbed Louis CK). Pretty prolific for a corpse, y'think?

Possibly if he were to redeem himself by helping a larger guy with a temporary disability to his arm and lift a large couch or other piece of furniture into a van. Could he be told to put the lotion in the basket?

8114590,5,B000EULSSY,"Jim Norton isn't the most famous comedian, but he's definitely edgy and you can tell that his comedy is genuine and not forced.  The man finds humor in less obvious and sometimes darker parts of life.  You might have seen him on HBO's Lucky Louie or on the forum on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn on Comedy Central.  I think he also does spots of the Opie and Anthony radio show as well.  This DVD is a perfect representation of his comedy stylings and made me laugh harder than virtually any other comic I've seen in the last 5 years.  His comedy isn't for everybody, and some people might find it offensive, but I think a true comedian leaves nothing off limits.  Jim Norton has great vocal impact and a command of the English language to move quickly with his words and still allow them to sink in just as fast.  What I'm saying is that it's not like listening to Dennis Miller, who tells a joke that you need an encyclopedia to figure out, but rather a mix of intelligence and unexpected blows to the mind.  If you're looking for a new and different kind of stand up comedy, this DVD gives you a lot of bang for you buck.",1168646400,4,1123,4.289099526066351
