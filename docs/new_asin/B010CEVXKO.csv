A truck leaves the prison of San Quentin. Their sirens wail. An empty barrel falls off a truck. A man leaves this barrel and hides in the brush. Motorcycle cops race after the truck. He hitches a ride in a passing car. The driver questions him. Too nosy? A woman stops her car and offers a ride to Vince. [Believable?] Irene Jansen takes him home and explains her reasons. Her father was convicted of the same crime of wife-murder. Vince leaves with his new clothes. The taxicab driver talks to Vince. How did he know? The driver tells Vince about a doctor who can change his appearance. Vince wants to stay at a friend's apartment for a week. We learn that Madge testified against Vince as a frame-up. Vince's wife had a temper. Dr. Walter Coley offers his opinion, he has a special technique. Coley offers his advice and a farewell.

When Vince returns to George's place he finds a big surprise! He has only one place of refuge now. He sees an open car with unusual seat covers. The police say Vince killed George. Bob offers an explanation for Vince's actions, caused by Madge's hatred. Madge tells about the other day. Why is that man watching Irene's apartment? Finally the bandages come off and we see the results. Can Vincent solve the crime? Not a good idea. Irene gives him a new name, Alan, as he leaves. A cop in a diner questions him - he has no raincoat and asked about a closed racetrack! Alan makes a get-away! A knock on his hotel door brings a surprise. They make a deal. The visitor explained how he figured it out. Baker gives him advice. Alan drives under the Golden Gate Bridge. Baker tells about the car that followed Alan. Now he knows who the murderer is!

Alan goes to visit Madge. A bright orange car? Alan tells her about an opal ring. Madge realizes this is Vincent Parry! Vincent explains his reasoning. Madge admits what she did, but won't sign a confession. ""She'll never have you!"" Madge makes a final statement. Alan flees down the fire escape and takes a cable car. The police are watching. Vince wants to go to Arizona by bus. He calls Irene to tell her what happened with Madge. Vince arrives in Arizona, so does Irene. Will they live happily ever after?

This movie was not successful. The story seems too far-fetched, too many coincidences. Also, Irene and Vincent are not admirable characters, even if they are innocent. Would you want either of them for friends or neighbors? Do they seem to have too much bad luck? This story reminds me of another movie or novel.",1475193600,,2550,4.53695652173913
8721785,4,B010CEVXKO,"On a highway near San Quentin a woman knowingly picks up an escaped convict convicted of murder.
Interestingly filmed from Bogarts point of view (1st person) for the first part of the film. Bogart and Bacall are sensational together. (Bacall is at her most beautiful.) Wonderful character actors add flavor to the film. There are many coincidences and improbabilities in the plot, but because of the suspense and mystery and exceptional acting, this is a very good movie. If you're unfamiliar with Bogart or Bacall, see this movie. If you're a fan, and haven't seen this movie, see it.",1471824000,,585,4.91919191919192
