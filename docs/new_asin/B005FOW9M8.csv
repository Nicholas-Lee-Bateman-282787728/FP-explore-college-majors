Gracias el precio increible!! Mejor Novela del Mundo!!! :D,1331856000,,295,4.584905660377358
4683605,4,B005FOW9M8,"Exelente Dvd!!! Contiene lo mas importante de la Historia, Muy Dinamico. Lo unico que no me gusto fue que en el Final falta la Escena del Final de Renata, cuando Leonardo le dispara y ella minutos despues muere, sin ser eso, lo demas esta muy bien. Me Gusto Muchisimo!!!",1330560000,3,270,4.530612244897959
4683606,4,B005FOW9M8,"I love telenovelas but do not watch the full versions since I do not like the stress. I wait 4 the abbreviated DVD versions. If the DVD is more than 11 hrs u can bet it's a half way decent abbreviation. Less than that don't bother, it won't make sense unless u have seen the entire novela on TV. I found the storyline very easy 2 follow on this DVD. The EXTRAS were nice but most of them had no sound so u r left wondering what was said.",1330128000,4,437,3.9213483146067416
4683607,2,B005FOW9M8,"I watched this novela on tv and wanted to buy it because I enjoyed it so much. However, this DVD is TERRIBLE!! They left out so many parts and it is always jumping from one scene to the next. There are no smooth transitions. I wish I hadn't bought it at all because it was definitely not worth the money.",1328140800,7,304,4.083333333333333
4683608,5,B005FOW9M8,"Eva Luna is one of the best novelas ever made, with one of the best actors ever known, Guy Ecker is a beautiful man, and Blanca Soto is naturally beautiful and talented woman. I've seen him in person and he's an amazing man. This novela is exciting and couldn't be better.",1327536000,2,272,4.352941176470588
4683609,5,B005FOW9M8,"A previous reviewer complained about the editing of this movie.  I personally found no fault with the editing of this movie for Dvd.  I love this telenovela and one of the few I look forward to watching again.  Guy Ecker is now older, but still has the charm and magnetism.  YES, THERE ARE ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!!!!!!",1325289600,,315,4.672727272727273
4683610,5,B005FOW9M8,"Love this telenovela. I am a big fan of Guy Ecker, and I could not wait for this telenovela to come out. The set is fabulous, the soundtrack is amaising. Blanca Soto is very beautiful as Eva Luna. The story is typical of telenovela genre has everyything drama and suspence.",1319328000,3,273,4.48
4683611,2,B005FOW9M8,"I misread the run-time when ordering this, so was unprepared for the degree of abridgement. It doesn't work: characters and situations leap ridiculously out of nowhere. Telenovelas are not known for their dramatic subtleties, but this abridged version of Eva Luna has been so drastically cut down that it lurches from one screaming dnouement to another. Sub-plots are made virtually incomprehensible by the chaotic slashing of storylines. This dvd is little more than a string of the 'last time on...' resums which appear before each episode.
I bought it because telenovelas are usually a fun, easy way of improving my Spanish. This overly-abridged dvd version was not fun. It was annoying.",1318636800,7,690,5.225225225225225

8470384,4,B005FOW9M8,"Guy ecker looks great in this soap.

Miss universe plays Eva, a poor, feisty young woman who takes a job as caregiver to an elderly husband for a rich family. The daughter of the family is the girlfriend of ecker.

The family is snobby and wife of old man is evil and wants to get rid of him.

Ecker falls in love with Eva, but girlfriend manipulates to keep him. Meanwhile, old man decides to take revenge on his wife by leaving his money to Eva.

Miss universe - tall, white, and well-educated - is an unlikely Mexican peasant agricultural worker (her character comes from poor, peasant farm workers), but it's a soap.

Skinny actress who plays the rotten girlfriend got butt implants, and her exaggerated bubble butt is a laugh.",1475625600,,731,4.549618320610687
