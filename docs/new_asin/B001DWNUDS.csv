8295216,4,B001DWNUDS,"This DVD has great ideas for your travel adventures, with excellent photography to inspire you to make your 2013 exciting.",1357948800,,122,5.15
8295217,1,B001DWNUDS,"I agree, that the couple was not the best choice - emotionless and dull behaving. But even their travels seem to be quite boring - this dvd ismore like advertising for tourist destinations, than depiction of joy of traveling and discovering new cultures and ideas. It was so boring, I couldn't watch it-barely got through Peru part.",1319587200,2,332,4.842105263157895
8295218,2,B001DWNUDS,Buyer beware. These are not your typical vacation destinations. Nor are the hosts your typical tour guides. I wasn't entertained or anxious to visit any of the sites.,1318896000,2,166,4.964285714285714
8295219,4,B001DWNUDS,this is a good DVD.  I am glad I found this programm on DVD.  we need to be able to play our favorite shows on our DVD players.  Video on demand ties up computer memory on the HD.  so I am glad to find DVD on some of these things.,1295654400,,230,3.54
8295220,1,B001DWNUDS,"I am not sure why this particular couple was chosen for this series but they lacked the vocabulary to describe what they were experiencing. It was ""wow"" and ""cool"" until you wanted to throw something at the screen. Judging from the uniformity of their assessments, all 1000 places are about the same. So why visit them?",1280707200,5,319,4.714285714285714
8295221,1,B001DWNUDS,"I thought this DVD could have been done in a more mature way.  The couple said, ""wow"" too many times instead of describing what they were doing. . .",1244419200,6,148,4.103448275862069
